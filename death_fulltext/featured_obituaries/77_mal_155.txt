        George Alford Stacey, a designer who decorated the homes of socially prominent Americans for more than half a century, died on Friday at the Dewitt Nursing Home in Manhattan. He was 91 and maintained residences in Manhattan, Paris and Houdan, France.
        He died after a short illness, said Anne Cheney Zinsser, a family friend.
        Mr. Stacey's clients, who were also his friends, included John Hay Whitney, Vincent Astor, Ward Cheney, Harold K. Guinzburg, W. Averell Harriman, William S. Paley and Ava Gardner.
        He was featured in the book, "Legendary Decorators of the Twentieth Century" (Doubleday, 1992) by Mark Hampton, the interior designer.
        Among Mr. Stacey's better known designs were the Victorian-inspired interior of Barbara (Babe) Paley's residence on Long Island; a mix of 18th century French gilt furniture and modern upholstery in Ava Gardner's house in Madrid, and the mixture of French and English antiques in the Cheney brownstone on Sutton Square in Manhattan.
        Born in Stratford, Conn., Mr. Stacey shunned the family lumber business to go to the Parsons School of Design in New York City. There, his talent was recognized by William Odom, the antiques expert, who arranged a scholarship for him to study in Paris.
        Mr. Stacey returned to New York, worked briefly for Taylor & Low, Madison Avenue decorators, and then went back to France. For a time, he and Hans Van Nes, the photographer, ran an antiques business. Mr. Stacey, based in Paris, selected furniture and shipped it back to Mr. Van Nes in New York. When the Depression struck, the antiques business failed and Mr. Stacey began his career as an independent designer.
