        Paul Itta, a restaurateur who owned Mickey Walker's Bar and Grill in its heyday in the 1930's, died on Sunday at the Sunrest Nursing Home in Port Jefferson, L.I. He was 97 years old and had been a resident of Yonkers until two years ago.
        He died of heart failure, his son, John Paul, said.
        Mr. Itta was one of three brothers who came from Greece to the United States separately when each was around 12 years old. All went into the restaurant business and related catering and casino ventures. John, the oldest of the three, died at 100 years of age in 1988; Phil, the other brother, died at 98 in 1989.
        Paul Itta was a head waiter at the Waldorf-Astoria and before that at the Calumet and Park Chambers hotels in Manhattan. After that, he ran Mickey Walker's opposite the old Madison Square Garden on Eighth Avenue at 50th Street. He retired in his late 60's, but after six months he returned as maitre d'hotel of the Mermaid Room at the Park Sheraton, now the Omni Park Central, for nearly a decade.
        Besides his son, who lives in Manhattan and Setauket, L.I., Mr. Itta is survived by a daughter, Alice Vlachos of Yonkers, and two grandsons.
