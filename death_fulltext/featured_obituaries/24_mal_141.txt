        Robert M. Weitman, a former film, stage and television producer, died Friday at his home in Beverly Hills. He was 83 years old.
        Born in 1905 on Manhattan's Lower East Side, Mr. Weitman's first job in show business was as a doorman at the Paramount Theatre in Times Square. A 1927 graduate of Cornell University, he entered the Paramount Management Training School and later managed the Brooklyn Paramount Theatre.
        At the theater, Mr. Weitman developed a reputation as a showman. One night, recalled a longtime friend, Thomas M. Pryor, he decided to use a crane to suspend a crooning Bing Crosby over the seats.
        ''The crane failed, and he was stranded up there,'' Mr. Pryor said. ''They had to call the fire department.'' By 1935, Mr. Weitman was managing the Paramount Theatre in Times Square, where he introduced many well-known big bands.
        At the Paramount, Mr. Weitman also staged glittering fund-raisers for the Cerebral Palsy Foundation, the United Jewish Appeal, and the New York City Police Department.
        When Paramount merged with the American Broadcasting Company in 1953, Mr. Weitman became an ABC vice president. In 1956 he moved to CBS. Later he went to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, then to Columbia Pictures in 1967, and, in 1969, became an independent producer. Among the films he produced on his own was ''Shamus.''
        He is survived by his wife, Sylvia; two daughters, Abby Karp of Bronxville, N.Y., and Murphy Romano of Toluca Lake, Calif., and four grandchildren.
