        William B. Mullins, a former Peace Corps official who became a foundation executive, died of lung cancer yesterday at his home in Pittsburgh. He was 52 years old.
        Mr. Mullins was an assistant to R. Sargent Shriver in the formation of the Peace Corps in the early 1960's, and he later helped Mr. Shriver establish the Office of Economic Opportunity under President Lyndon B. Johnson. In 1969 President Richard M. Nixon appointed Mr. Mullins to be the White House liaison officer with youth groups.
        In 1972 he became assistant director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, which works to protect the environment. In 1976 he returned to Pittsburgh as vice president of the Sarah Sciafe Foundation, which deals with public policy issues, and four years later he was named president of the Schumann Foundation of Montclair, N.J., which specializes in international relations, effective government and the environment.
        The foundation said yesterday that Bill Moyers, the television journalist, would succeed Mr. Mullins as its head and also as head of the Schumann Fund for New Jersey.
        Mr. Mullins is survived by three daughters, Terrell Wright of Burlington, Vt., and Virginia and Maria Mullins, both of Pittsburgh; a son, William L. Mullins of Burlington; his mother, Virginia, of Pittsburgh, two brothers, Thomas of London and Bryan of Pittsburgh, and a grandson.
