        Jim (Buster) Poole, one of three brothers to play football for the Giants and a member of four New York teams that played in championship games, died on Wednesday in Baptist Memorial Hospital in Oxford, Miss. He was 79.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Poole, an end, played for the Giants from 1937 to 1941 and returned to them in 1946, after one year with the Chicago Cardinals. The Giants were the National Football League's champions in 1938, and lost title games in 1939, 1941 and 1946. After leaving professional football, Poole was an assistant football coach from 1947 to 1970 at Mississippi, where he played football for three seasons.
        Besides his brothers, Ray and Barney, he is survived by his wife, Anna; a son, James E. Jr.; a daughter, Joanna Heidel, three sisters and four grandchildren.
