        Rudi Gassner, a former professional soccer player who became one of the world's top music industry executives, died on Saturday, just days before he was to take over BMG Entertainment, the music division of Bertelsmann. He was 58.
        The cause was a heart attack, BMG executives said. Mr. Gassner had been jogging with his wife, Brook, at their vacation home in Samerberg, Germany, near Munich.
        Last January, Mr. Gassner resigned as head of BMG's international unit because of clashes with Michael Dornemann, the chairman, and Strauss Zelnick, the chief executive.
        But in a sudden reversal of fortune, Bertelsmann announced last November that Mr. Gassner would return to take over BMG.
        Mr. Gassner had lived in the United States the last 13 years, most recently in Greenwich, Conn. In addition to his wife, he is survived by four children, Claudia, Beatrice, Alexandra and Maximilian.
