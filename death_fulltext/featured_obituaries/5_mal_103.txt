        Charles Maynard Brooks, a labor attorney who helped draft the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 and a former head of industrial relations for Texaco Inc., died of a heart attack Monday at Memorial City Hospital in Houston. He was 76 years old and lived in Houston.
        As a trial attorney with the National Labor Relations Board, Mr. Brooks helped write the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, popularly known as Taft-Hartley. The law made unions as well as management subject to cease-and-desist orders from the National Labor Relations Board. Opponents saw the legislation as giving employers rights already enjoyed by labor, and unions denounced it as sanctioning ''slave labor.''
        After working for the labor board, Mr. Brooks joined Texaco in 1948 as its labor counsel. He was promoted to be the director of industrial relations for the company's worldwide operations in 1954. He held that post, working at Texaco's New York City headquarters, until his retirement in 1976.
        Mr. Brooks was born in Wood County, Tex., in 1911, and attended Texas State Teachers College and Rollins College in Winter Park, Fla. He received his law degree from National University in Washington in 1936. During World War II, he served in the Army Air Corps, reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel.
        Mr. Brooks is survived by his wife, Kay; two daughters, Cathy Brooks and Shirley Manaski, both of Houston; two sons, Jay, of Houston and Charles of Forty Fort, Pa; a sister, Dorothy Tomlins of Deerfield Beach, Fla.; a brother, Joe of Denton, Tex.; five grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter.
