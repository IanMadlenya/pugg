        Will McDonough, a powerful voice of sports journalism at The Boston Globe since 1960, died Thursday at his home in Hingham, Mass. The cause of death was not determined. He was 67.
        Mr. McDonough had a mild heart attack last month followed by an angioplasty. Hours before his death, he had a stress test that revealed no problems, said Georgia Peirce, a spokeswoman for Massachusetts General Hospital.
        Mr. McDonough specialized in football and covered every Super Bowl. He found a national platform for his news about the National Football League when he augmented his newspaper work by joining the Sunday morning N.F.L. programs on CBS, from 1986 to 1989, and on NBC, from 1990 to 1998.
        Working with experienced announcers like Brent Musburger and Bob Costas, Mr. McDonough stood out because of his craggy looks, raw delivery and South Boston accent.
        Although the Globe preferred that he break all his news in his column -- and not on television -- it recognized that it would rather have him six days a week than not at all.
        He is survived by his wife, Denise; three sons, Sean, an announcer for the Red Sox and for ABC Sports, Terry and Ryan; and two daughters, Cara and Erin.
        Mr. McDonough worked at The Globe while in the co-op program at Northeastern University. After he graduated in 1959, he worked at a Waltham, Mass., newspaper, then returned to The Globe in 1960.
        He retired from The Globe in July 2001, but continued to write a weekly column.
        In his last column, which ran last Saturday, he called Larry Lucchino, the president of the Boston Red Sox, ''the invisible director'' of the team for living in La Jolla, Calif. Mr. Lucchino told Mr. McDonough to stick to football.
