        George H. Williams, who was president of American University in Washington from 1968 to 1975, died on May 18 in Evanston, Ill., where he lived. He was 85.
        The cause was complications of an infection, The Chicago Daily Law Bulletin said.
        Born in Hempstead, N.Y., George Howard Williams received a bachelor's degree from what became Hofstra College and a law degree from New York University, where he later became an executive vice president.
        He served in North Africa and Europe in World War II. He rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel, won a Silver Star for bravery and other decorations and was held prisoner by the Germans for eight months before escaping.
        Mr. Williams became an instructor of law at New York University in 1948.
        He was the university's executive vice president for planning and development from 1966 to 1968.
        His son Kevin said he had directed a $100 million fund-raising campaign for N.Y.U., some proceeds of which were used to build its Elmer Bobst Library.
        Mr. Williams is survived by his wife, Molly; two sons, Stephen, of Covington, Ga., and Kevin, of Wilmette, Ill.; two daughters, Mary Beth Barritt of Burlington, Vt., and Jeanne Williams of Watertown, Mass.; a sister, Jeanette W. Glier of Westbury, N.Y.; and five grandchildren.
