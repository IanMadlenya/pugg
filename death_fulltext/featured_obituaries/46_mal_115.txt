        Werner Jarowinsky, a former economics official in East Germany and member of the Politburo at the time of the Communist Party's fall from power there, died Oct. 22. He was 63 years old.
        The cause of death was not given.
        Mr. Jarowinsky had served in the Ministry of Commerce and Supply since 1956 and became Deputy Minister in the early 1960's. In 1963, he assumed responsibility for commerce matters in the Central Committee of the Communist Party.
        Mr. Jarowinsky became a full member of the Politburo in 1984. Last year, as a popular revolution shook the Communists' hold on power, he was given the leadership of the party's faction in Parliament. Mr. Jarowinsky was relieved of that post early this year and later expelled from the party, now the Party for Democratic Socialism.
