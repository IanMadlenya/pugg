        He died of cancer, his son, Thomas, said.
        Mr. Ewig was in shipping for 50 years, beginning in 1924 in Bremen, Germany. From 1924 to 1926, he worked for the North German Lloyd Line and helped open offices in Chile, Panama and Colombia. He returned to Bremen in 1936 and later was executive director of the ports of Bremen and Bremerhaven. He immigrated to the United States in 1950 and in 1957 established his own company, representing Bremen ports and shipping interests. He served as president until 1975, when he retired but retained the position of chairman.
        He is survived by his wife, Ilse; two sons, Caspar, of South Orange, N.J and Thomas, of Convent Station, N.J., and a sister, Elisabeth Peters of Bogota, Colombia.
