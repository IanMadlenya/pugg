        Robert F. Andrews, an industrial designer who specialized in streamlining cars, died on Friday at the Flower Hospital in Toledo, Ohio. He was 68 years old and lived in Monroe, Mich.
        Mr. Andrews died of lung cancer, a family spokesman said.
        In the early 1960's, he was the chief designer of the Studebaker Avanti, now a classic sporty car, while working with Raymond Loewy, a founder of the movement toward streamlined design. Mr. Andrews was also a designer of the step-down 1948 Hudson, the Willys Jeepster, a BMW experimental car, the interior of the French Caravelle jet and a redesign of Air Force One.
        He was a native of Howell, Mich., and a graduate of Monroe High School. He held many patents and was a contributing editor to Automotive Quarterly and Classic Car magazines. A recovering alcoholic, he gave much of his time over the last 30 years to counseling others like himself.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Doris Homoky; two sons, Scott, of South Bend, Ind., and Ted, of West Lafayette, Ind.; a daughter, Lisa, of Royal Oak, Mich.; two sisters, Marilyn Kelner of Trenton, Mich., and Barbara Meyer of Monroe, and three grandchildren.
