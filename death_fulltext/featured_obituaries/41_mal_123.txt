        The Rev. William Van Etten Casey, a former academic vice president of Boston College and later professor of theology at Holy Cross College, died Wednesday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He was 76 years old.
        The Rev. Joseph R. Fahey, an associate, said Father Casey died from complications after surgery for an aortal aneurysm.
        Father Casey, who lived in Boston, entered the Jesuit order after attending Boston College for a year. He received graduate degrees in philosophy, English and theology, and was ordained in 1944.
        In 1946 he began teaching theology at Boston College. Ten years later he was named dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, and in 1958 he was appointed as Boston College's first academic vice president.
        Theologian at Holy Cross
        In the 1960's Father Casey left Boston College to teach theology at Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass. In the 1967-68 academic year, on leave from Holy Cross, he became director of the American School of Oriental Research in Jerusalem.
        After he retired from teaching in 1979 Father Casey, who had been the editor and publisher of the Holy Cross Quarterly, an alumni magazine, continued to write extensively.
        In 1987 he wrote a one-man play, ''Immortal Diamond, a Jesuit in Poets' Corner,'' whose subject is Gerard Manley Hopkins. the 19th-century English poet who became a Jesuit and is entombed in Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey.
        Father Casey is survived by a nephew and four nieces.
