        Paul Russell, a principal dancer of Dance Theater of Harlem and the San Francisco Ballet, died on Friday at the Davies Medical Center in San Francisco. He was 43 years old.
        He died of AIDS, his companion, Randy Griffin, said.
        Mr. Russell was a classical dancer of teasing flamboyancy and exuberant spirit. A performer of striking stage presence, he was known for his steadfast and sensitive partnering and dazzling virtuoso dancing in the grand pas de deux from "Don Quixote" and "Le Corsaire."
        He was also capable of delicacy and poignancy in ballets like John Taras's "Design for Strings" and Stuart Sebastian's "Aftermath." Among his best-known roles was that of the insouciant lead Harlem jive dancer, dressed in a red loincloth and a derby, in Louis Johnson's "Forces of Rhythm." Mr. Russell was also thought to be the first black to dance Siegfried in a full-length performance of "Swan Lake."
        Mr. Russell, who was born in Texas, was trained in New York City at the School of American Ballet and the Dance Theater of Harlem School. He made his debut as a performer in 1970, with the Hartford Ballet, and he joined the Harlem company in 1971. In 1977, he left the Harlem company to go to Leningrad to study with Natalya Dudinskaya, the director of the Kirov Ballet school. He performed with the Scottish National Ballet in Glasgow, where he danced Siegfried, before joining the San Francisco Ballet, where he danced from 1981 to 1986.
        He began to choreograph after a hip injury forced him to retire from performing. In 1988, he became artistic director of the American Festival Ballet of Boise, in Idaho, a post he held at the time of his death.
        Mr. Russell also taught ballet, primarily at the schools of Dance Theater of Harlem and San Francisco Ballet. He was also known as a speaker, and participated in lectures and demonstrations to introduce black artists to white audiences.
