        Stass Reed, a member of Czarist Russian nobility who became a New York businessman, died of a heart attack on Wednesday at the DeWitt Nursing Home in Manhattan. He was 76 years old and had homes in Manhattan, Paris and Palm Beach, Fla.
        Mr. Reed was born in Kiev and was a son of Prince Georgi Kropotkin, who was killed in the Russian revolution of 1917. He was taken to Paris by his mother, a Polish noblewoman. He was educated there and graduated from the University of Paris.
        He came to the United States in the late 1930's and changed his name to Stass Reed from Stanislaus Raugiewics, which he had been given when he was adopted as a child by his stepfather.
        Mr. Reed represented various European shipping companies here. In the late 1950's and early 1960's he owned Reed's Wine and Spirits, a shop on Madison Avenue at 72d Street specializing in champagnes and wines.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Martha M. Cuneo.
