        Judge Robert A. Wall, who continued the judicial tradition established by his grandfather and father in northwestern Connecticut, died on Sunday in the Litchfield Woods rest home in Torrington, Conn. He was 85 and a resident of Harwinton, Conn.
        The cause was respiratory failure, said a son, A. Robert Wall Jr. of Torrington.
        After graduation from Georgetown University and the New York University Law School, he returned to his native Torrington, where he headed the Municipal Prosecution Office. After his return from World War II Army service, he was appointed judge of the Torrington Court, a post his grandfather, Edmond, had once held.
        In 1949, he began working for the Connecticut House of Representatives and by 1953 was its clerk and shortly after, he was named legislative commissioner. In 1958, he was appointed a judge in Court of Common Pleas, a position once held by his father, Thomas J.
        In 1966, he was appointed a Superior Court judge, serving until his retirement in 1979. He was then a state trial referee until 1990.
        Besides his son Robert, he is survived by his wife, Eileen Fitzgerald Wall; a daughter, Geraldine Dearington of Madison; a second son, Patrick J., of Harwinton; a brother, Thomas F., of Winsted; three sisters, Alice Gatesy of Torrington, Marie Fay of Stuart, Fla., and Helene Gersuny of Peace Dale, R.I., and eight grandchildren.
