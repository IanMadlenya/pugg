        Col. Ezra Kotcher, the first director of the United States Air Force Institute of Technology, died Thursday at the United States Naval Hospital in Oakland, Calif. He was 87 years old and lived in Oakland.
        Colonel Kotcher died of a heart attack, his family said.
        During and after World War II, as an officer in the Air Materiel Command, he perfected inflight fueling and directed development of the X-1 and X-2 jet planes.
        Colonel Kotcher, a native of Brooklyn, was a graduate of the University of California at Berkeley and held a master's degree in aeronautical engineering from the University of Michigan.
        In 1928 he became an instructor at Wright Field in Ohio, later the Air Corps Engineering School. He was a senior professor there when the United States entered World War II and he went on active duty. After the war, he served as head of technical intelligence for the Air Force in Japan before returning to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to head the Air Force Institute.
        After the Korean War, he was named director of the Wright Air Development Center, a post he held until he retired in 1961.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Etta Jean Horwitz, whom he married in 1929; two daughters, Nina Louise Ziegler of Piedmont, Calif., and Linda Ann Kotcher of San Francisco, and three grandsons.
