        Maurice A. Weinstein, a champion of Jewish education on the national level, died on Tuesday at Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte, N.C. He was 79 and lived in Charlotte.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Weinstein helped to create a study institute for adult Jews at Wildacres, N.C., in 1948. The retreat gave rise to the B'nai B'rith Institutes of Judaism, the centerpiece of a national B'nai B'rith adult education program.
        He was the founding chairman of the B'Nai B'rith Continuing Jewish Education Commission, which publishes books and sponsors the B'nai B'rith Jewish Book Club and the B'nai B'rith Lecture Bureau. He was a past chairman of the International Council of B'nai B'rith.
        Born in Salem, N.J., Mr. Weinstein graduated from Duke University in 1937 and from its law school in 1940.
        He founded Weinstein & Sturges in Charlotte after service in World War II. He retired several years ago.
        Mr. Weinstein is survived by two daughters, Marcia W. Simon of Charlotte, and Deborah Weinstein of Melrose Park, Pa.; a son, Robert H., of Charlotte, and six grandchildren.
