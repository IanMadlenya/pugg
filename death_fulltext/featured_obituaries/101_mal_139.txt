        Jonathan S. Berg, a real estate broker and former vice president of the Corcoran Group who was active in AIDS education, died on Saturday at his summer home in Pound Ridge, N.Y. He was 34 and also lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was complications from AIDS, said his companion, Steven Yee of Manhattan.
        Mr. Berg worked with the People with AIDS Coalition, lecturing at high schools throughout the metropolitan region.
        He also helped create an AIDS education program at the Town and Village Synagogue on 14th Street in Manhattan. The program became a model for many synagogues throughout the country.
        Last year, he helped to establish the Project for Being and Dying through the Upaya Foundation in Santa Fe, N.M., and endowed a scholarship there.
        Mr. Berg, who was born in Worcester, Mass., graduated from American University in Washington in 1983.
        Besides his companion, he is survived by his parents, Lois and Burton Berg of Worcester, Mass., and a sister, Betsey Berg of Monterey, Mass.
