        Shigeo Shingo, an industrial-management specialist who helped the Toyota Motor Company and other industrial concerns improve their production methods, died of cancer on Wednesday in Tokyo. He was 81 years old.
        Dr. Shingo devised a number of techniques to improve assembly-line production, especially at Toyota, and was co-developer with Taiichi Ohno of the "just in time" inventory method, which permits a manufacturer to keep a very low level of parts on hand at any given time, thereby reducing costs.
        He also promulgated "poka yoka," the Japanese term for mistake-proofing, which provides quick feedback to managers as a means of identifying production problems and remedying them.
        Dr. Shingo, a graduate of Yamanashi Technical College in Japan, began work at a railway factory in Taiwan in 1930. In World War II he helped raise productivity for Japan's Ministry of Munitions. After the war he joined the Japan Management Association and served there until he founded a consulting business, the Institute for Management Improvement, in 1959.
        After counseling Japanese industry for more than a quarter century, he began consulting work for European and American companies in the early 1970's. He lectured widely and was the author of 24 books, most dealing with productivity improvement.
        Dr. Shingo is survived by a wife and three sons.
