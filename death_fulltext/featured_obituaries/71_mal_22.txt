        William R. Kearns, an American who became a well-known actor in France, died last Friday at his home in Chateau d'Oex, Switzerland. He was 69 years old.
        Patrick M. McGrady Jr., a family friend, reported Mr. Kearns's death yesterday and said the cause was lung cancer.
        During World War II, Mr. Kearns was a member of the 10th Mountain Division, the Army's elite corps of skiers and mountain climbers who saw action in Europe. He settled in France in 1954 as an accountant for the American Battle Monuments Commission. A year later, he began writing on sports, economics and government for a French-language publication of the United States Information Service.
        In 1958 Mr. Kearns answered an advertisement in The International Herald Tribune for an American actor and was hired immediately despite his inexperience. As Bill Kearns, his face, which he called a "bulldog mug," and his speech, studded with Americanisms, became familiar through a career that included more than 150 films, several French television movies, several stage plays, and dubbing roles in 1,200 movies.
        He played a cigar-puffing American tycoon in Jacques Tati's "Playtime," was featured in Orson Welles's film "The Trial" and had a major role in "Purple Noon," starring Alain Delon.
        He is survived by his wife, Norma; two sons, William B., of Chateau d'Oex, and Patrick, of Paris; and two daughters, Erin, of Lake Forest, Calif., and Kate, of Chateau d'Oex.
