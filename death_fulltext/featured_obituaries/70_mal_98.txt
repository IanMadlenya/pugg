        Stanley V. Margolis, a geochemist and professor of geology at the University of California at Davis, died last Saturday at the Sutter Davis Hospital. He was 49 years old and lived in Davis.
        He died after a four-month battle with cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Margolis was among the international experts invited in 1983 to examine the authenticity of the celebrated 2,500-year-old Greek statue owned by the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif. Through tests with X-rays, light and electron microscopy and a micro-probe, he determined that the magnesium on the surface of the marble had been leached away in a process that would require many centuries.
        In recent years, Dr. Margolis had been a prominent member of a consortium of geoscientists studying the effects of extraterrestrial impact on the earth. His work helped in the understanding of a catastrophic landing of a meteorite or a comet on the planet 65 million years ago, leading to the abrupt demise of dinosaurs and other fauna.
        He was born in New York City. He graduated from the University of Miami, received a master's degree in geology from Florida State University and a doctoral degree in geology and oceanography from the University of California at Riverside.
        Dr. Margolis joined the oceanography program at the University of Hawaii in 1971 as an assistant professor and was its chairman from 1979 to 1981. In 1982 he was appointed director of the oceanography division of the Naval Ocean Research and Development Activity in Washington.
        His began his career at Davis as a professor in the geology department in 1983 and was most recently faculty chairman in the College of Letters and Science.
        He is survived by his wife, Karen; a daughter, Amy, and a son, David, all of Davis.
