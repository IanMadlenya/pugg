        George Cox, a former chief executive of the General Electric Company's turbine division in Schenectady, died at Saratoga Hospital on Tuesday after suffering a heart attack at his home in Saratoga Springs, company officials said. He was 65 years old.
        Mr. Cox joined General Electric in 1950 in Portland, Ore., and joined the turbine division in 1962. He became general manager of G.E.'s newly created large steam turbine-generator division in 1977 and a senior vice president and chief executive in 1978. He retired in 1986.
        The turbine industry began to sour during the end of Mr. Cox's tenure and his successor, Russell Noll Jr., immediately laid off hundreds of workers, consolidated the business and moved the gas-turbine manufacturing operations to Greenville, S.C. Steam-turbine operations remain in Schenectady.
        Mr. Cox was a native of Madison, Wis., and a graduate of the University of Oregon.
        He is survived by his wife, Norma; a son, a daughter, his mother, and a grandchild.
