        Breandan O hEithir, a social critic and author of the first Irish-language novel to lead the country's best-seller list, died on Friday. He was 60 years old.
        Mr. O hEithir, who divided his time between Dublin and Paris, was admitted to St. Vincent's Hospital last week and was diagnosed as having cancer.
        His novel "Lig Sinn i gCathu," published in 1976, was the only Irish-language book ever to top Ireland's hardback best-seller list.
        Translated into English as "Lead Us Into Temptation," the book was set in a university town in 1948, the year Ireland declared itself a republic and withdrew from the Commonwealth. The book was also translated into German, and the accumulation of royalties in East German marks encouraged Mr. O hEithir to travel in that country.
        Mr. O hEithir was born Jan. 18, 1930, at Inishmore in the Aran Islands. His maternal uncle was the Irish writer Liam O'Flaherty.
        Other books included "Over the Bar," "The Begrudger's Guide to Irish Politics," "This is Ireland," and "Willie the Plain Pint agus An Papa."
        In "The Begrudger's Guide," published in 1986, Mr. O hEithir identified begrudgers as the nation's largest faction. They were distinguished, he wrote, by "a deep and abiding doubt about our ability to run our own affairs as well as others might run them for us."
        He is survived by his wife, three sons and a daughter. The funeral service will be held Tuesday.
