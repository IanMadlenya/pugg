        Count Michel d'Ornano, an industrialist and a former French Cabinet minister, died yesterday after he was struck by a car near his home in the Paris suburb of St.-Cloud, Reuters reported. He was 66 years old.
        Count d'Ornano, a native of Paris who descended from a long line of French aristocrats, was co-founder of the perfume houses of Jean D'Albret and Orlane. Elected to Parliament in 1967 as an Independent Republican from the Normandy constituency of Calvados, he served in three Cabinet posts -- industry, culture and environment -- between 1974 and 1981 under President Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
        He was Mayor of Deauville from 1962 to 1977, and his wife, the former Anne de Contades, has served as Mayor since then. In 1977, he ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of Paris on the Giscardist ticket.
        In addition to his wife, Count d'Ornano is survived by a daughter, Catherine, and a son, Jean-Guillaume.
