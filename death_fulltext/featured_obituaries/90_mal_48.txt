        Ernst Beadle, a photographer whose work was published in Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and other magazines, died on June 21 at the Southwestern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington, Vt. He was 73 and had lived since the 1980's in Vermont, most recently in the Bennington Convalescent Center.
        The cause of death was heart failure, and he had diabetes and had suffered heart attacks, said Wini Hawkes, a friend.
        Mr. Beadle had a studio in New York City for decades. He specialized in fashion early in his career and then expanded to still lifes, food, personalities, gardens, architecture, interior decoration and other subjects.
        His work appeared in House Beautiful and in House & Garden, which published photographs by him of historic houses and rooms in the Metropolitan Museum of Art and other museums during the 1970's. His pictures were also used in books including "Decorating with Flowers" by Denise Otis (Abrams, 1990).
        Mr. Beadle was born in Carl's Junction, a small town outside Joplin, Mo., and studied at the University of Iowa and at the Art Center in Los Angeles. In the 1980's he moved to Manchester, Vt.
        He was divorced from his wife, Gina. He is survived by a son, Joshua, of San Diego; three daughters, Arletty Haynes of Boca Raton, Fla., Gamine Newman of Austin, Tex., and Allegra Needle, who also lives in Texas, and six grandchildren.
