        A native of Russia, Mr. Talalay was educated in England and graduated with a degree in chemistry from University College in London. He came to this country in 1940.
        During World War II, he developed a device that reduced the risk of fuel fires in bombers. But he was best known for contributing to the development and manufacture of latex foam-rubber products.
        In 1943 he joined the Sponge Rubber Products Company of Shelton, Conn., which became a division of B. F. Goodrich in 1954. He was named head of the division two years later. Goodrich sold the subsidiary in the early 1970's.
        In retirement, Mr. Talalay continued his inventions and last year received a patent for a self-retracting hypodermic needle designed to reduce the risk of infections of medical staff.
        His survivors include his wife, Marjorie Phillips Talalay; two brothers, Anselm, of Cleveland and Dr. Paul, of Baltimore; and a stepson, Thomas Dorman.
