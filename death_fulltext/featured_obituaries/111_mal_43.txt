        Frank William Paice, a longtime trainer for the New York Rangers who over the years became a friend and confidant to many of the team's players, died Saturday in Daytona Beach, Fla. He was 82.
        Mr. Paice was the team's trainer from 1948 to 1977, working for 13 coaches in that time. Among the many Ranger players who developed friendships with Mr. Paice were Andy Bathgate, Vic Hadfield, Rod Gilbert and Harry Howell.
        He was also a favorite of former coach Emile Francis, who said yesterday that Mr. Paice was "the last of a breed, a one-man staff who attended to the team's training needs and was equipment manager, traveling secretary and chief cheerleader as well."
        Gregarious and self-deprecating, Mr. Paice became known for an easygoing manner that produced comments such as "we'll tape an aspirin to it and you'll play." He was a fixture in two Madison Square Gardens and,,according to friends,,loved the arena and the people in it, from the star players to the ushers.
        Born in Montreal on Dec. 16, 1913, Mr. Paice got his start in hockey in 1924  as a stickboy at the Montreal Forum, first for visiting teams, then for the Montreal Maroons, whom he worked for in various capacities until the team folded in 1938. He joined the Ranger organization in 1946, when he became the trainer for the New York Rovers, the minor league farm team, then moved to New York in 1948.
        He retired from the Rangers in 1977 and made his home in Daytona Beach.
        He is survived by his wife, Anita, and a daughter, Candy, of Hummelstown, Pa.
