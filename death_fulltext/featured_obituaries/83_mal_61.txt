        Philip G. Steiner, an entrepreneur who helped develop and market innovative toys, died on Nov. 24 at his home in Hyde Park, Ohio. He was 92.
        Mr. Steiner, with his brothers, Joseph and Albert, founded Kenner Products in Cincinnati in 1946. Originally a soap and flavoring concern, the brothers branched out in the 1950's.
        Their research into bubbles led to their first toy, the Bubblematic, a gun that shoots streams of soap bubbles. Later products included Play-Doh, Easy Bake Oven and Spirograph.
        The company was sold to General Mills Inc. in 1967, and Mr. Steiner retired in 1971.
        He was a nationally ranked contract bridge champion in the 1930's, and was a director and a vice president of the American Contract Bridge League.
        Mr. Steiner is survived by his wife, Edna, of Hyde Park; two sons, Richard, of North Avondale, Ohio, and Philip, of Mount Adams, Ohio, and his brother Joseph, of Hyde Park.
