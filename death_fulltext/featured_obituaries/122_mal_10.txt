        John S. Minary, who turned a chance wartime encounter in London into a lifelong job as William S. Paley's personal financial adviser, died Feb. 18 at his home in Charlottesville, Va. He was 88.
        A banker's son from Benton Harbor, Mich., Mr. Minary graduated from Dartmouth College and received a law degree from DePaul University, but it was his experience as a lieutenant colonel on Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower's staff in London in World War II that laid the foundation for his career.
        Mr. Paley, the CBS founder, who was also on Eisenhower's staff, was so impressed with his younger colleague that he enlisted him as a business adviser. Mr. Minary concentrated on Mr. Paley's personal investment and philanthropic activities.
        Mr. Minary, who married when he was 74, moved to Charlottesville several years ago. At his death, he was an executor of the Paley estate and a trustee of numerous Paley trusts.
        Mr. Minary is survived by his wife, the former Ruth Moorman.
