        Bruce B. Decker, a Republican political consultant who devoted himself to advocacy for people with AIDS after learning that he was infected with H.I.V., died on Saturday at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif. He was 45.
        The cause was complications from AIDS, said a friend, Rick Reidy.
        Mr. Decker was born in Palo Alto, Calif., and attended the University of Santa Clara and the University of Denver. In the mid-1970's, according to his resume, he was an advance man for President Gerald R. Ford and Vice President Nelson A. Rockefeller. He returned to California in 1977 and worked as a consultant.
        In 1984, he learned he was infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.  That year. he helped found Concerned Americans for Individual Rights, a national group that tried to expand Republicans' understanding of homosexual issues.
        Later in 1984, he was named chairman of the California AIDS Advisory Committee by Gov. George Deukmejian, a Republican. Mr. Decker, who was not given to understatement, called himself "Deukmejian's house fairy." But he resigned from the AIDS panel in 1988 after Mr. Deukmejian supported a statewide ballot measure to compel anyone testing positive for H.I.V. to be reported to the state. The measure, Proposition 102, was rejected by voters.
        In 1986, Mr. Decker established the Health Policy and Research Foundation, to coordinate long-term AIDS research, education and treatment. In 1993, he was a co-founder of the World AIDS Vaccine Initiative.
        Mr. Decker is survived by his mother, Julia H. Decker, of Klamath Falls, Ore.; his father, William, of Ashland, Ore. and a sister, Pamela Daner, of Eugene, Ore.
