        Howard A. Bartnick, a senior investment banking lawyer, died on Friday while  at a business meeting in Manhattan. He was 43 and lived in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.
        The cause was heart failure, said Sarah A. Luke, a spokeswoman for Paine Webber Inc., the investment banking concern where Mr. Bartnick worked as a senior vice president and general counsel for capital markets and investment banking.
        Mr. Bartnick, who was born in Brooklyn, graduated from the State University  at Buffalo, and received a master's degree from the University of Miami before graduating with distinction from Emory University Law School in Atlanta.
        After working at the Securities and Exchange Commission as an assistant director for market regulation, Mr. Bartnick became senior counsel for the Bank  of America in San Francisco, and then director of compliance at Prudential Securities in New York, before moving to Paine Webber in 1993.
        He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth; a son, Aaron, and a daughter, Emma, both of Briarcliff Manor; his parents, Earl and Lillian Bartnick of Delray Beach, Fla., and a sister, Mindy Bartnick of Manhattan.
