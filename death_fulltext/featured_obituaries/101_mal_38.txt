        Warren Sonbert, an independent film maker, died on Wednesday at his home in San Francisco. He was 47.
        The cause was AIDS, said Ascension Serrano, his companion.
        Mr. Sonbert began making films in 1966 while still a student at New York University. He made 18 films in all, many of which were shown at film festivals around the world.
        His films, most of which were silent and were notable for their striking and sometimes surreal imagery, included "Carriage Trade," shown at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1973; "The Cup and the Lip," part of the 1986 Cineprobe series of avant-garde films at the Museum of Modern Art; "Honor and Obey," one of five short films under the collective title "Avant-Garde Voice" at the 26th New York Film Festival in 1988, and "Friendly Witness," shown at the festival the next year. In her review in The New York Times, Caryn James said the film captured "a complex sense of the exotic and the ordinary in life."
        Mr. Sonbert's work was given retrospective exhibitions by the Whitney Museum, the Berlin Film Festival, the Norsk Film Institute in Oslo and Anthology Film Archives in New York City. His films are in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the British Film Institute in London and the Vienna Film Museum, among others.
        In addition to his companion, he is survived by a father, Jack Sonbert of San Diego, and two brothers.
