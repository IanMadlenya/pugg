        Philip Sperling, a bibliophile who in decades of haunting lower Manhattan's antiquarian bookstores gathered a trove of rare books from early 19th-century London, died on Jan. 9 at Lenox Hill Hospital. He was 85 and lived in Manhattan.
        He amassed some 400 volumes published by William Pickering, whose authors ranged from Homer and Virgil to Shakespeare and Milton, along with 53 volumes of English poetry under the Aldine imprint.
        Mr. Sperling retired in 1973 from the Metropolitan Wire Goods Corporation, a maker of industrial wire products and restaurant equipment. Until early this month, he worked one day a week at the Grolier, the bibliophile's haven on East 60th Street.
        He is survived by a daughter, Amy R. Sperling, and a brother, Mortimer, both of Manhattan.
