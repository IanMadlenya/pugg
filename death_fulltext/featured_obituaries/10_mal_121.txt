        Sir John Colville, principal private secretary to Sir Winston Churchill and two other prime ministers, has died, family death notices said today. He was 72 years old.
        Sir John died Thursday at his home in Broughton, a Hampshire village about 75 miles southwest of London, the notices said. The cause of death was not stated.
        He won first-class honors at Trinity College, Cambridge, and joined the Foreign Office in 1937.
        In 1939 he became assistant private secretary to Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. World War II began in September that year and John Colville flew on 40 operations as a Royal Air Force fighter pilot.
        Sir John stayed at No. 10 Downing Street, the prime minister's official residence, when Churchill succeeded Chamberlain in May 1940.
        He also served Clement Attlee, the Labor Party leader who defeated Churchill's Conservatives in July 1945.
        From 1947 to 1949, he was secretary to Princess Elizabeth before she became Queen. He married one of Elizabeth's ladies-in-waiting, Lady Margaret Egerton, and the couple had two sons and a daughter.
