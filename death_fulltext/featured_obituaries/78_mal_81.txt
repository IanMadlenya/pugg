        John H. Frazier Jr., a commodities trader and past vice chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade, died on July 8 at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. He was 75 and lived in Chicago.
        The cause was complications from leukemia, his family said.
        Mr. Frazier, known as Bud, started in the business in 1940. At his death he was president of the U.S. Futures and Options Company, which he founded last year.
        Born in Toledo, Ohio, he graduated in 1939 from the Wharton School of Finance at the University of Pennsylvania. In World War II, he graduated from the Naval Supply Corps School at the Harvard School of Business and, as a lieutenant, saw action on D-Day in Europe and in Okinawa.
        Over the years he worked for the Bunge Corporation and the Clayton Brokerage Company. He was a partner at Hennessy and Associates and at Frazier-Parrot. A past president of the National Feed and Grain Association, he served as vice chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade, the country's oldest and largest commodities-futures market, in 1977.
        Mr. Frazier is survived by his wife of 52 years, Dolores (Lory) Thornhill Frazier; two sons, John H. 3d of Kauai, Hawaii, and Richard T. of Berwyn, Pa.; his parents, John H. and Minnie Frazier of Lansdowne, Pa., and four grandchildren.
