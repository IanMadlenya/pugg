        Rafael A. Lafferty, a prolific science fiction writer best known for his short stories and his fresh, eccentric style, died on March 18 in Broken Arrow, Okla. He was 87.
        Mr. Lafferty, who wrote under the name R. A. Lafferty, had a strong, satirical style and pushed the limits of his genre. One story asked what would happen if everyone on earth had a gun, and another created a world in which fads were created, peaked and died all in a day. A Roman Catholic, he was known for the theological content of his writing.
        He wrote more than 200 short stories and 21 novels -- historical novels as well as science fiction.
        Mr. Lafferty received the Hugo Award from the World Science Fiction Society in 1973 for his short story ''Eurema's Damn.''
        Rafael Aloysius Lafferty was born on Nov. 7, 1914, in Neola, Iowa, and his family moved to Perry, Okla., when he was 4. He eventually settled in Tulsa and lived most of his life there. He was mostly self-taught, though he attended the University of Tulsa for a year and took several correspondence courses. He taught himself Greek in order to read the New Testament in the original.
        Mr. Lafferty did not start his career until his 40's. He had worked mostly at the Clark Electrical Supply Company in Tulsa until then, and had served for four years in the Army during World War II in the South Pacific. His first story was published in 1959, and his first novel, ''Past Master,'' in 1968; it was nominated for a Hugo Award.
        Mr. Lafferty left no immediate survivors. A bachelor whose one extravagance was his collection of books, Mr. Lafferty lived with his sister until she died; he never learned to drive. Though he had worked with and studied electronics for many years, he never wrote on anything but a manual typewriter.
