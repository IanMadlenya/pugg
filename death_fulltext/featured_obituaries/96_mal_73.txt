        Ralph Merrifield, a British archeologist and an authority on London when it was under the Roman Empire, died last Monday in King's College Hospital in London. He was 81 and lived in London.
        The cause was cardiac arrest after a brief illness, said his wife, Lysbeth.
        Mr. Merrifield retired in 1978 as deputy director of the Museum of London. He has worked for other museums in London and in Brighton, 50 miles to the south.
        Another British archeologist specializing in Roman London, Peter Marsden, wrote on Friday, in the British newspaper The Independent, that Mr. Merrifield was "the only person since the Second World War to map the remains of the Roman city and the first to reconstruct its beginnings nearly 2,000 years ago."
        Not long after its founding, Roman London, called Londinium, was sacked by the Iceni tribe of Britain, but it rebounded and remained part of the Roman Empire's system of defenses and communications until early in the fifth century.
        Mr. Merrifield's books included "The Roman City of London" (1965), in which he wrote, "Roman London seems to have been a city of contrasts, a curious mingling of civilization and barbarism, of the exotic and the native, in which luxury and squalor went hand in hand, and where imposing stone buildings stood in close proximity to wooden shacks."
        Mr. Merrifield's conclusion that the alignment of old walls suggested the existence of a large but forgotten Roman structure led to a major discovery, of a basilica and forum from Londonium, Dr. Marsden recalled.
        Mr. Merrifield was born in Brighton, earned a bachelor's degree in anthropology from London University in 1935 and later was awarded an honorary doctorate from London University.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son and a daughter.
