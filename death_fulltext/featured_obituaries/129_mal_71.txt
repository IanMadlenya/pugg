        Dr. Michael E. Burt, a thoracic surgeon who was president of the medical staff at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, died on Oct. 4 in Southampton, N.Y. He was 49 and lived in Manhattan.
        He was killed in a motorcycle accident. The police said he apparently lost control of his motorcycle and struck a telephone pole.
        After 12 years at the hospital, Dr. Burt was elected president of the medical staff in April. As president, he represented the staff in policy-making. At the same time, the hospital named him to the Alfred P. Sloan Chair in surgery.
        Earlier in his career, at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., Dr. Burt found ways to use nutrition to starve a tumor while maintaining the body's health.
        Dr. Burt's later research was intended to stop the spread, or metastasis, of cancer in the lung.
        The blood to the lung was isolated from the rest of the body during surgery, and an anticancer drug was given directly to the lung to attack tumor cells there while sparing the body's healthy tissues.
        Dr. Burt was born in Newark, and he received a bachelor's degree in chemistry from Rutgers in 1970. He attended Cornell Medical School and received his M.D. from St. Louis University School of Medicine in 1975 and a Ph.D. in biochemistry from George Washington University in 1981.
        He joined the staff of Memorial Sloan-Kettering in 1985. He was an associate professor of biochemistry and surgery at Cornell University Medical College in Manhattan.
        He is survived by his wife, Kathleen; a son, Bryan, of Manhattan; a daughter, Lauren, of Clifton, N.J.; his parents, Shirley and Maurice Mastromonico of Toms River, N.J., and a sister, Gail Jannicelli of Clifton, N.J.
