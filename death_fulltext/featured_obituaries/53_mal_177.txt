        G. Warfield Hobbs 3d, a former chairman of the National Committee on the Aging, died on Saturday in Longwood, Fla. He was 85 years old and moved there last year after living in both Stonington, Conn., and Englewood, Fla., for two decades.
        He died of cancer of the liver, his wife, Helen, said.
        Mr. Hobbs retired in 1965 as a Manhattan-based vice president of the First National City Bank of New York, now Citibank, part of Citicorp.
        Under his leadership, the Committee on Aging provided information and counseling in areas like health, employment, retirement and social welfare.
        In a speech in 1957, Mr. Hobbs contended that thousands of scientists and engineers were being forced to retire when they could be performing vital national services. And in testimony before a New York State legislative committee in 1953, he warned that rapid expansion of pension systems could harm the American economy.
        Mr. Hobbs was born and grew up in Baltimore. He earned a bachelor's degree at Johns Hopkins University in 1928 and then joined the bank, where he headed the pension trust division from 1938 until he retired. He served in the Army Air Forces in World War II.
        Besides his wife, the former Helen I. Miller, Mr. Hobbs is survived by a daughter, Susan Connell of North Stonington; two sons, G. Warfield 4th, of New Canaan, Conn., and William, of Milwaukee, and four grandchildren.
