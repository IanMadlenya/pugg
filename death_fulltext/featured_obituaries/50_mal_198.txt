        H. Chandlee Forman, an architect, historian and archeologist who served as chief architect of the National Park Service, died Monday at his home in Easton, Md. He was 87 years old.
        Dr. Forman died of cancer, his grandson, Brent Foreman of Concord, Mass., said.
        As an architect Dr. Foreman specialized in private residence restorations. In the 1930's his historical and archeological discoveries at Jamestown, Va., and St. Marys City, Md., contributed to the understanding of these two landmark North American settlements.
        He was the author of 14 books, primarily about American homes of the 17th to early 19th centuries. They included "The Architecture of the Old South: The Medieval Style, 1585-1850" (Harvard University Press; 1948).
        In the 1940's and 1950's he was professor and head of the art department at Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Ga.
        He was a fellow of the American Institute of Architects and in 1989 received the institute's presidential award for historic resources.
        Dr. Forman graduated from Princeton University in 1926. He received an M.A. in architecture and a Ph.D. in fine arts at the University of Pennsylvania.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Rebecca Russell; two children from a former marriage, Elizabeth Harrell of Arcata, Calif., and Richard T. T. Forman of Concord, Mass.; and eight grandchildren.
