        Prof. Max August Zorn, who developed a fundamental premise of algebraic structure theory, died Tuesday at Bloomington Hospital in Bloomington, Ind. He was 86 and lived in Bloomington.
        The cause of death was congestive heart failure, said Indiana University, where Dr. Zorn taught mathematics from 1946 until his retirement in 1971.
        While a Sterling Fellow at Yale University in the 1934-35 academic year, Dr. Zorn worked out an assumption about the basic structure of mathematics that came to be known as Zorn's lemma, a lemma being a proposition assumed to be true and used in proving a theorem. He posited it in his late 20's, and it remains a staple of mathematical study.
        Zorn's lemma is the equivalent of the Axiom of Choice in set theory, which states that given an infinite number of sets it is possible to make a new set by choosing one item from each of the other sets.
        "It sounds simple," said Professor John Ewing, head of the mathematics department at Indiana, "but it turns out that this cannot be derived from other axioms of mathematics."
        "It is completely universal," Dr. Ewing added, "and must be invoked frequently in all areas of mathematics."
        Dr. Zorn was born in Krefeld, Germany, and received his doctorate at the University of Hamburg. He taught at the University of Halle and the University of Hamburg before coming to the United States in 1933, after Hitler gained power.
        After his stay at Yale, Dr. Zorn taught at the University of California at Los Angeles for 10 years and then joined the Indiana faculty. Even after his formal retirement 22 years ago, he remained a familiar figure on the Bloomington campus until the end of his life.
        Dr. Zorn is survived by his wife, the former Alice Schlottau; a son, Jens C., of Ann Arbor, Mich.; a daughter, Liz A. Zorn of Bloomington; two grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
