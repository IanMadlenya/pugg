        Billy Mitchell, a bebop tenor saxophone player who matured in the Detroit jazz scene of the 1950's and played in the bands of Woody Herman, Dizzy Gillespie and Count Basie, died on April 18 at his home in Rockville Centre, N.Y. He was 74.
        The cause was lung cancer, said Thelma Higgins Pritchett, his cousin.
        Mr. Mitchell, who spent 34 years as the resident star of one of the few suburban jazz strongholds, Sonny's Place in Seaford, N.Y., recorded 10 albums under his own name and played host to a floating jam session of visiting jazz stars at Sonny's. When the restaurant closed in 1997, Mr. Mitchell retired as well.
        Born Willie Melvin Mitchell in Kansas City, Mo., he moved to Detroit as a teenager and was playing on the road by the time he was 17. Known for a deep, confident sound that borrowed from Lester Young and Coleman Hawkins, he worked with Nat Towles's band in Detroit and with Lucky Millinder's Orchestra in New York in the late 1940's.
        Mr. Mitchell played with Dizzie Gillespie's band in 1956 and 1957; a high point of his career was a memorable solo on ''Cool Breeze'' with the band at the 1957 Newport Jazz Festival. In the early 1960's he led a sextet with Al Grey. He played with Basie twice, from 1957 to 1961 and again in the mid-1960's.
        Much of his legacy lies in the musical guidance he gave to the next generation. When he worked with young musicians, ''you could see the growth in their playing in a very short period of time,'' said Bill Easley, also a tenor saxophone player.
        Mr. Mitchell's philosophy of music was as unpretentious as his playing. ''There's 12 notes, and you just shuffle them around,'' he was fond of saying. He also had a brief career as a film actor in the 1940's, playing a bank detective in the 1940 W. C. Fields comedy ''The Bank Dick.''
        He is survived by three grandchildren.
