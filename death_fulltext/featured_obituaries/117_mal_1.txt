        Harold Claassen, a newspaper man for 45 years in New York who headed sports departments at both The New York Herald Tribune and The New York Times, died yesterday at Lee Memorial Hospital in Fort Myers, Fla., following a long illness stemming from cancer complications. He was 75.
        After he succeeded Stanley Woodward in 1962, Mr. Claassen was the last sports editor of The Tribune, the newspaper for which he had gone to work as a messenger out of Bayside High School in 1938. Along the way to the sports department, he was a librarian, copy editor and makeup editor at The Tribune.
        After The Tribune ceased publication in 1966, Mr. Claassen served as Sunday sports editor for the merger newspaper that followed, The World Journal Tribune, until a month before that newspaper folded in 1967. For the next two years, he served as deputy editor of The Bond Buyer, a financial publication.
        Mr. Claassen joined The Times in 1969 and worked in sports as a copy editor, makeup editor, weekend editor and assistant sports editor. He served as acting sports editor in 1978 and was the deputy sports editor upon his retirement in 1983.
        Mr. Claassen, who lived in Beechhurst, Queens, until three years ago, is survived by his wife of 51 years, Joanne; a son, John, of Manhattan, and a daughter, Candace Kuhta, of Washington.
