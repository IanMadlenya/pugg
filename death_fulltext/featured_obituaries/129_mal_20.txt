        Arthur E. Smith, an interior designer known for his comfortable yet tailored interiors, died on Friday at New York Hospital. He was 56 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was lymphoma, said Andrew Crispo, his companion.
        Mr. Smith, who was born in Vidalia, Ga., graduated from Auburn University in 1960. He moved to New York City, where he first worked for Edward Garratt, an antiques dealer whose gallery was on East 57th Street until 1966. While working for the gallery, Mr. Smith first met Billy Baldwin, the legendary interior designer, and went to work for him, first as his assistant for seven years and later as his partner until Mr. Baldwin's retirement in 1972.
        Mr. Smith then began his own business, Arthur E. Smith Inc., and went on to help Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis decorate her homes in Greece and on Nantucket. Among Mr. Smith's other clients were Mrs. Paul Mellon and the actors Uma Thurman and George Segal. Over the years his work has appeared in publications like Architectural Digest, House and Garden and The New York Times.
        He was known for his shy, quiet manner, and the rooms he decorated reflected his personality. They combined his sense of style with understatement.
        In 1990, in an interview in Architectural Digest, Mr. Smith was asked if there was a minimum-size project he would accept. ''No,'' he replied. ''I will decorate anything from a lampshade to a villa, the size of the project means very little.''
        He never wanted rooms to look newly decorated, he said, and encouraged his clients to acquire dogs and cats, referring to pets as his secret assistants. ''They give a patina of age to things,'' he once said.
        In addition to Mr. Crispo, he is survived by his mother, Mary Smith, and a sister, Mary Lou Russell, both of Vidalia.
