        Mr. Horton, a composer of dozens of country-and-western ballads, played the mandolin and other string instruments and performed for more than 50 years with such musicians as Gene Autry, Jimmie Rodgers and Lionel Hampton. His songs - ''Mockingbird Hill,'' ''Sugar Foot Rag,'' ''Teardrops in My Heart'' and others - were recorded by many musicians, and his work as a writer and arranger appeared on 28 gold records. Mr. Horton, who was born in Broad Top, Pa., and graduated from Pennsylvania State College, was inducted into the Song Writers' Hall of Fame in Nashville in 1971.
        Mr. Horton is survived by four sons: Bill, of East Islip, L.I.; Thomas, of Atlanta; Michael and George, both of New Port Richey, Fla.; a daughter, Patricia Masotti, of Brentwood, N.Y., and 29 grandchildren.
