        James T. Prendergast, a lawyer who specialized in home health care legislation, died on Wednesday at the Jacob Perlow Hospice in Manhattan. He was 62 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was brain cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Prendergast practiced law for 35 years in Manhattan and Albany. He represented the home health care industry and helped draft laws on regulated home care agencies and the awarding of Medicare and Medicaid contracts to them, his family said.
        He also represented the Legal Aid Society and consumer groups as a lobbyist in Albany and served on the New York City Bar Association's Lawyers in Transition Committee.
        Active in Upper East Side Democratic politics, he made several bids for nominations to public office and was the party's candidate for the State Senate in 1966.
        He wrote articles for legal journals and books. He and Edward Costikyan, the Democratic Party chairman of Manhattan, drafted a plan published in The New York Law Journal to have lawyers and judges create a panel to select a pool of potential candidates for political parties to nominate to judicial posts.
        Mr. Prendergast was born in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. He graduated from Yale University and Michigan Law School.
        His marriage to Margot Reynolds ended in divorce.
        His survivors include his fiancee, Suzanne Hall of Manhattan; a daughter, Kate Prendergast of Manhattan, and a sister, Ellen Gerber of Shaker Heights, Ohio.
