        Alexander Cores, a violinist who founded the Dorian String Quartet, died on Saturday at his home in New York City. He was 93.
        The cause was heart failure, said Emil Chudnovsky, a friend.
        Mr. Cores was equally active as a soloist, a chamber player and orchestral musician. He was a member of the New York Philharmonic from 1925 to 1931, and gave recitals in the United States and Europe. He played first violin in the Dorian String Quartet, which was known for its contemporary-music series, heard on CBS radio. He also organized chamber music groups for concerts and recordings with Isaac Stern, Jascha Heifetz and other musicians.
        Mr. Cores was born in Russia. He studied violin in Berlin and later at the Juilliard School, with Leopold Auer and Paul Kochanski. He recorded for Columbia Masterworks, was a musical consultant for MGM records and taught at the Mannes College of Music.
        No immediate family members survive.
