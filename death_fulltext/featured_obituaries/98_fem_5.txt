        Margery Mastbaum Solomon, one of America's leading bridge players, died on Saturday at her home in Elkins Park, Pa. She was 86.
        The cause was pulmonary fibrosis, said her daughter Norma Brunswick of Rydal, Pa.
        Mrs. Solomon, who was always known as Peggy, represented the United States in several international bridge competitions. In 1972, she was a member of the American team that finished third in the World Team Olympiad.
        Her most important success was a victory in the National Board-a-Match Teams, now called the Reisinger Teams, in 1944. She won nine other national titles in the Mixed Teams in 1949, 1950 and 1959; the Women's Teams in 1948, 1953, 1954, 1961 and 1967, and the Women's Pairs in 1960. Her 14 second-place results included all three major national team championships, the Spingold Knockout in 1944, the Board-a-Match in 1953 and the Vanderbilt Knockout in 1954. In 1944 she became the 33d person, and only the third woman, to reach the rank of life master.
        Mrs. Solomon was a member of a prominent Philadelphia family. Her father, Jules Mastbaum, a real estate investor who owned a chain of movie theaters, bought many Rodin sculptures in France and built a museum to house them. The Rodin Museum was presented to the City of Philadelphia and opened in 1927 shortly after his death.
        Her second husband, Charles Solomon, a former president of the American Contract Bridge League and the World Bridge Federation, died in 1975. She was previously married to Benjamin Golder, a Pennsylvania member of the House of Representatives for 12 years who also headed the national bridge organization; Mr. Golder died in 1946.
        In addition to Mrs. Brunswick, Mrs. Solomon is survived by a sister, Lisa Dickson of Beverly Hills, Calif.; another daughter, Joan Ash of Elkins Park; eight grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.
