        J. Edward Corn, an arts manager and administrator, died on Oct. 16 at St. Joseph's Hospital in St. Paul, Minn. He was 64 and lived in Sunfish Lake, Minn.
        The cause was complications from diabetes, his family said.
        Mr. Corn was born in St. Louis, and after graduating from Yale University in 1954, he returned to his hometown to be the public relations manager of the St. Louis Municipal Opera.
        In the late 1950's and early 60's he was an assistant manager of the St. Louis Symphony and then a director of special events at Washington University. Later he became executive producer of the Minnesota Opera, where he mounted several world premieres.
        His career took him to many other cities. He served as manager of the San Francisco Opera and its touring arm, the Western Opera Theater, director of planning and public affairs at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, and manager of the Opera Company of Philadelphia.
        In 1980 he became the director of the National Endowment for the Arts' new opera and musical theater program, a position he held for two years before returning to arts management as director of Wolf Trap Farm Park in Vienna, Va.
        Most recently he served as founder and president of Arts Pacific, an organization that fostered co-productions of opera and musical theater in China.
        He is survived by his wife, Jane Wu Corn, his children Sophia and Jason Joseph, all of Sunfish Lake, Minn., and a sister, Terrie Liberman, of St. Louis.
