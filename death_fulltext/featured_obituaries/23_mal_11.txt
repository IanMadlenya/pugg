        In the 1920's, Mr. Keyhoe, a pilot with the Marine Corps, accompanied Charles A. Lindbergh in publicity flights across the United States, after Lindbergh's solo flight across the Atlantic.
        His interest in unidentified flying objects began in 1949 and he came to believe that they were from outer space. He wrote several books about U.F.O.'s, including ''Flying Saucers are Real'' in 1950 and ''Flying Saucers From Outer Space'' in 1953.
        He was a director of the National Committee on Aerial Phenomena, which sought to persuade the Air Force to investigate U.F.O. sightings. The organization later disbanded.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Helen Gardner, of Luray; two daughters, Kathleen and Caroline, both of Hyattsville, Md.; a son, Joseph, of Bethesda, Md.; and a sister Katherine, of Asheville, N.C.
