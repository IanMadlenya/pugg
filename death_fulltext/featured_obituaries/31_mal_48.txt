        Walter Ballard, who flew the plane that carried the nation's first load of transcontinental airmail in 1932, died after a lengthy illness Sunday at home. He was 93 years old.
        Mr. Ballard was a pilot for American Airways, now American Airlines, when he flew the first leg from San Diego's Lindbergh Field to Phoenix on the transcontinental mail flight, said Edwin McKellar, executive director of the San Diego Aerospace Museum.
        Mr. Ballard learned to fly in World War I and was a test pilot in World War II, leaving the Navy with the rank of lieutenant commander, Mr. McKellar said.
        He was also involved in cross-country racing, precision aerobatics and test piloting. He logged more than three million air miles and 20,000 flying hours in 25 types of planes.
        Mr. Ballard was a volunteer at the San Diego Aerospace Museum until a few months before his death. Mr. McKellar said Mr. Ballard ''spent many hours and years helping to restore planes in our collection.''
        He is survived by his wife, Susan.
