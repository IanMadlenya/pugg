        George Schechter, an official of the United Housing Foundation for more than 30 years who also served with the Agency for International Development, died of a brain tumor on Sunday at St. Rose's Home, a hospice on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. He was 69 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Schechter was active in the cooperative housing movement for nearly half a century. He joined the foundation, which is believed to be New York City's largest developer of nonprofit middle-income housing, in 1946 and was instrumental in the planning, construction and management of Penn South in Manhattan, Co-op City in the Bronx and Rochdale Village in Queens.
        In 1957, he joined A.I.D. to supervise the forming of housing cooperatives in several countries in Africa and in Central and South America. He returned to the foundation in 1965 as vice president of its operational and development arm, Community Services Inc., and for the last 10 years was administrative director of Coordinated Housing Services Inc., providing management assistance to member cooperatives.
        He was born in Manhattan. He graduated from City College and served in the Army in World War II.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Dana Gross; two sons, Mark and David, both of Manhattan; a brother, Jerry, of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., and two grandchildren.
