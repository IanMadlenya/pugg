        Robert Adamson Maes, a surgeon who was president of the Independence Foundation of Philadelphia, died Tuesday at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. He was 81 years old and lived in Glenmoore, Pa.
        Dr. Maes died of cancer, a spokeswoman for the family said.
        He was elected president of the foundation in 1959, succeeding Robert Donnor, a Colorado industrialist who established the organization in 1932 as the International Cancer Research Foundation in memory of his son, Joseph Donnor. In 1945 the directors turned to the support of secondary education through endowments and scholarships for the needy.
        More recently, the foundation has been involved in supporting education to meet the country's shortage of nurses.
        Dr. Maes, a former professor of surgery at Tulane University and Louisiana State University. was a past president of the American College of Surgeons. He was also a trustee of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and of Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa., and the Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass.
        He was a director of several corporations, among them the Savannah Electric and Power Company, the General Transistor Corporation of Boston and the Iowa Electric Light and Power Company.
        A native of New Orleans, he graduated from Phillips Academy, Yale University and Harvard Business School. He served in the Navy from 1942 to 1945.
        He is survived by a son, Robert Jr. of San Francisco; a daughter, Nancy Aherne of Washington, and six grandchildren.
        Correction:  August 7, 1991, Wednesday
        An obituary on July 15 about Robert Adamson Maes included some erroneous descriptions of his career. As reported, Mr. Maes was president of the Independence Foundation of Philadelphia. But it was his late father, Dr. Urban Maes, who was a surgeon, former president of the American College of Surgeons and a professor at Tulane and Louisiana State Universities.
