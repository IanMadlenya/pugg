        Bernard F. Huppe, a medieval scholar and a founding professor of Harpur College, later the State University Center at Binghamton, died of a heart attack Thursday at his home in Binghamton, N.Y. He was 77 years old.
        Dr. Huppe was chairman of the humanities division from 1950 to 1965. He helped to build a liberal arts program that was Harpur College's cornerstone. He later became chairman of the English department at SUNY-Binghamton.
        In the early 1970's, he was chosen ''Distinguished Service Professor'' at the university, one of the first to be so honored. He retired in 1981 but returned to the university the next year and was teaching a class, ''Sacred and Profane Love in the Middle Ages,'' this semester.
        Dr. Huppe began his teaching career at New York University. He also taught at Princeton. He was a graduate of Amherst College, and he earned a doctorate from New York University.
        Dr. Huppe, a widower, is survived by a daughter, Anne Spencer of Binghamton; two sons, Alex, of Hanover, N.H., and Geoffrey, of Rochester; two sisters, Madeleine Eliot of Darien, Conn., and Vera Maxwell, the fashion designer, of Manhattan, and six grandchildren.
