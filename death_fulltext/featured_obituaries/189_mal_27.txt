        Daniel Deverell Perry, a Long Island architect who created the marble temple of art housing the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass., died Oct. 2 in Woodstock, N.Y. A longtime resident of Port Jefferson, N.Y., he was 97.
        He was born in Buffalo and was a 1930 architecture graduate of Syracuse University. Practicing on Long Island, he made a name for himself designing public schools and restoring historic buildings dating back as far as the 17th century.
        The Clarks, whose wealth and eclectic tastes were behind one of the country's legendary private collections, chose Mr. Perry to build the neo-Classical-style shrine for it in the Berkshires.
        When it opened in 1955, overlooking 140 acres of fields and ponds, Arts News celebrated its elegant galleries as the ''best organized and most highly functional museum erected anywhere.''
        Mr. Perry is survived by his son, G. Daniel, of Manhattan, and three grandsons. His wife, Mary Smoak Perry, died in 1986.
