        Cao Huoxing, a Chinese farmer's son who wrote a Communist song that has become familiar to hundreds of millions of Chinese, died on April 16 in Tianjin, in northern China, the official New China News Agency reported.
        He was 75 and had been chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Culture.
        Mr. Cao was born in Pingshan county in Hebei Province, in northern China. He was a composer from the age of 16 and reportedly wrote more than 1,500 songs.
        In 1943 he wrote the song for which he is best known, ''Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China.'' At that time, during World War II, China was divided into areas controlled by the Japanese invaders, the Nationalist Government and Communist forces. The Communists won a civil war with the Nationalists and took power in all of mainland China in 1949.
        The words are somewhat less impassioned than the text of the song by Tien Han and Nie Erh that was approved as the Communist national anthem in 1949. The anthem, originally a call to arms against the Japanese, includes the lines, ''For we throw ourselves with courage on the enemy/Forward, forward, forward!''
        The words of the more solemn song that was adopted in 1929 as Nationalist China's national anthem, based on words spoken by Sun Yat-sen with music by Cheng Mao-yun, include, ''Be earnest and brave, your country to save/One heart, one soul, one mind, one goal!''
        In 1982 Mr. Cao set off with 25 artists of the China Tianjin Song and Dance Troupe to appear at music festivals in Britain and elsewhere outside his homeland. The troupe's repertory included the nonpolitical dance numbers ''Flower Drum Dance'' and ''Merry Golden Fish.''
