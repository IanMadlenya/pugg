        Dr. Richard K. Hill, a child psychiatrist at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, died Thursday in New York. He was 64 and lived in Brooklyn.
        The cause was a bone marrow disease, his family said.
        He was affiliated with the medical center until 1995. That year he also retired as a psychiatric consultant to the New York State family court system in Staten Island.
        Dr. Hill, who was born in Salt Lake City, graduated from the University of Utah in 1957 and received his medical degree at Northwestern University in 1961. He completed his training at Mount Sinai Medical Center and practiced adult and child psychiatry in Manhattan from 1968 to 1983.
        He is survived by his wife, Ann; two daughters, Dr. Kirsten Avery of Raleigh, N.C., and Amy Hill of Brooklyn; two sons, Christopher and Thomas, also of Brooklyn; and a brother, Robert, of Waynesville, N.C.
