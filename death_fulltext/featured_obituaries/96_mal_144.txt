        Dr. Charles A. Flood, a gastroenterologist who taught generations of students at the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons and other institutions, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 90.
        The cause was heart failure, said his son Charles Jr..
        Dr. Flood, who graduated from Columbia College in 1925 and from the College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1928, was one of the school's most active alumni. His two-volume history, "P & S: The College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University," self-published in 1989 and 1993, traced the history of the school from 1767 through 1973.
        During World War II, Dr. Flood served in the United States Army in the Congo and was summoned to Algeria to care for Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower. Dr. Flood was discharged with the rank of lieutenant colonel.
        In 1949, he was part of the first group to be certified in gastroenterology when it was made a specialty.
        Dr. Flood's wife, Esta Suchoff Flood, died in 1985.
        Besides Charles Jr., of Manhattan, he is survived by his son Stephen, of Chappaqua, N.Y.; a daughter, Barbara, of Philadelphia; a sister, May Piccozzi of Shelter Island, L.I., four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
