        Dr. Sidney Visner, a physicist who was an expert on the commercial uses of nuclear power, died on Jan. 5 in his home in Atlanta. He was 77.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his son, Samuel Sanders Visner of Washington.
        As a senior member of the Institute for Nuclear Power Operations, which was founded by the industry to advise power companies on technical developments in nuclear energy, Dr. Visner provided counsel on safety, training and reliability issues.
        Before moving to Atlanta in 1982, he had been director of physics and computer analysis for Combustion Engineering in West Hartford, Conn., where he played a leading role in the firm's design of nuclear power plants.
        His wife of 43 years, Marjorie Sanders Visner, died in 1988. In addition to his son, Samuel, he is survived by his second wife, Sondra Breslau Visner, and two brothers, Harold, of Little Neck, L.I., and William, of New Milford, N.J.
