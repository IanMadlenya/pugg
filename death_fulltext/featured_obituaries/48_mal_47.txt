        Bernard Hellring, a leader in efforts to simplify and standardize state and national laws, particularly in business affairs, legislative apportionment and divorce, died on Friday in Orange, N.J. He was 74 years old and lived in South Orange, N.J.
        He died of a heart attack on his way to visit a client, a family spokesman said.
        Mr. Hellring, a dedicated fighter for right as he saw it, was, for more than 30 years, a New Jersey Commissioner on Uniform State Laws. He helped draft many model statutes in business transactions, trial practices, labor relations and estates, for the state and also for the nation, in conferences with counterparts from other states.
        He also led efforts to change New Jersey divorce laws and codify them in the state's so-called no-fault divorce law of 1971, and he helped chart the 1985 Congressional re-apportionment of the state. He was the founder and senior partner of a leading Newark law firm, now called Hellring Lindeman Goldstein & Siegal.
        Bernard Hellring was the son of an Austrian merchant whose family brought him to this country at the age of 3. He grew up in Newark, attended public schools there and earned a bachelor's degree at Lafayette College.
        He earned a law degree at Harvard University in 1939 and was later a member of the board of overseers for the university's law school, a president of the Harvard Law School Association of New Jersey and a national vice chairman of the law school's scholarship committee.
        In World War II, he served in the Washington Office of Scientific Research and Development. He was later a longtime adviser to the American Law Institute and special counsel to the New Jersey Commissioner of Conservation and Economic Development.
        Surviving are his wife of 42 years, the former Sally Horner; two daughters who are both lawyers, Margaret, of South Orange, and Heidi, of Millburn, N.J., and four grandchildren.
