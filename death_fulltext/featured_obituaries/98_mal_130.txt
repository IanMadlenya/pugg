        Bill Tice, a fashion designer who was known for stylish robes and lounge wear, died on March 9 in the Heather Glen care center in Glendale, Ariz. Mr. Tice, who was 52, was a long-time resident of Manhattan and moved to Phoenix two and a half years ago.
        The cause was lung cancer, said his sister, Dianne Cochran.
        A 30-year veteran of the apparel industry, Mr. Tice was known for designing dresses and pajamas that could be worn inside or outside the home. He was part of a small group of designers who put at-home wear into the wardrobes of shoppers by pricing the garments in the moderate range.
        Many designs were produced in cotton, but it was a hallmark of his approach to use rich colors and silks, giving at-home wear a less casual look.
        Mr. Tice, who was born in Tipton, Ind., studied fashion design at the University of Cincinnati. He got a start in the apparel industry in New York in the mid-1960's, and by 1969, he was a vice president of Royal Robes. Within four years, he had created his first line of dual-purpose clothes called ESP, a division of the Elias Sayour Company. He also designed for Malcolm Starr and had a long association with Swirl, a company that produced many of his most popular designs.
        With the flair of a showman, Mr. Tice used exotic settings to present his collections. In one show, skiers came down a darkened mountain in Alaska. In another, a tennis tournament in Monte Carlo was the backdrop. He also staged shows in major museums throughout the country.
        Mr. Tice received Tommy Awards in 1971 and 1988 from the American Printed Fabrics Council. He wrote "Enticements: How to Look Fabulous in Lingerie" (Macmillan, 1985).
        Besides his sister, who lives in Glendale, Ariz., he is survived by his father, Earl, also of Glendale, and a brother, Robert, of Arlington, Tex.
