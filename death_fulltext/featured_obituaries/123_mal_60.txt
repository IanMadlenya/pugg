        Richard Stockton, a playwright, died on April 5 at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. He was 65.
        The cause was a heart-valve infection and complications from a stroke, said his wife, Irene.
        Mr. Stockton's play ''Prisoner of the Crown'' had its premiere at the Abbey Theater in Dublin in 1972.  Many of his plays were produced off Broadway, including ''Royal Bob,'' ''One World at a Time'' and ''The Casket Maker.'' His work was also staged by the Milwaukee Repertory, the Virginia Museum Theater and the Bucks County Playhouse in Pennsylvania.
        In addition to his wife, a casting director, he is survived by two daughters, Jessica Stockton of Santa Monica, Calif., and Carlisle Stockton of Milton, Calif.; a son, David, of Larkspur, Calif.; two brothers, Howard, of Clearmont, Fla., and Edward,  of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio; a sister, Euleen Opplinger of Parkersburg, W. Va., and his mother, Margaret Williams Stockton of Cuyahoga Falls.
