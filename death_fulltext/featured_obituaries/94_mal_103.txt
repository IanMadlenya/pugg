        Dr. Samuel Henry Wilen, a professor of chemistry at the City College and a specialist in stereochemistry, died on Wednesday at Englewood (N.J.)Hospital. He was 63 and lived in Teaneck, N.J.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Wilen was born in Brussels and escaped the German occupation with his family, arriving in New York via Cuba in 1942.
        He graduated from City College and earned a doctorate in organic chemistry at the University of Kansas in 1956. He joined the City College faculty in 1957 after postdoctoral research at the University of Notre Dame. He became a full professor in 1970 and was chairman of the chemistry department from 1984 to 1987.
        Dr. Wilen was the author, co-author and editor of many papers and textbooks on stereochemistry, which deals with the shapes of molecules and the way these affect their principal chemical characteristics.
        Dr. Wilen is survived by his wife of 34 years, Rosamond Lewis Wilen; a son, Robert, of Palo Alto, Calif.; a daughter, Elizabeth Halpern of Chicago; a sister, Charlotte Plotsky of West Palm Beach, Fla., and a grandson.
