        Philip G. Reed, a reporter and wire service executive for four decades, died of emphysema last Thursday at Waterbury Hospital in Connecticut. He was 79 years old and lived in Southbury, Conn.
        Mr. Reed went to work for the International News Service in 1935 and remained with the company after it merged with United Press in 1958 to become United Press International. By the time he left U.P.I. in 1960, he had served as a reporter, war correspondent, managing editor and assistant general manager. He then became Eastern regional manager of the Register-Tribune Syndicate in Des Moines, from which he retired in 1971.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Ann Colberg; a son, Philip Jr., of Brookline, Mass.; a daughter, Sally A. Matero, of Boston, and two grandchildren.
