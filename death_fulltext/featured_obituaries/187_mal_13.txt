        Bernhard Lyon Kohn Sr., a retired tobacco executive and philanthropist, died on Saturday at his home in Bloomfield, Conn. He was 81.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        He became president of his family's business, the Kohn Brothers Tobacco Company, and sold it in 1953 to Cullman Brothers, a tobacco wholesaler. Later, he was an executive of Cullman Brothers and of the General Cigar Company, which Cullman later acquired, eventually becoming the Culbro Corporation. He was also president of the Sycamore Properties, a real estate holding company.
        Mr. Kohn, born in Hartford, was the longtime president of the Kohn-Joseloff Foundation.
        He is survived by his wife of 58 years, the former Joan Joseloff; a son, Bernhard Jr., of Bloomfield; a daughter, Kathryn Rieger of Naples, Fla., and Sandpoint, Idaho; and four grandchildren.
