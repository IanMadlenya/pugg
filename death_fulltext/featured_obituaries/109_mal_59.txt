        In 1994, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo appointed him to a five-year term on New York State's Public Transportation Safety Board.
        After serving in the Army Air Corps in World War II, Mr. Braun founded the Piping Rock Petroleum Company, a Long Island distributor of heating oil and gasoline. He later was named president of Granite Management Services, a leasing company in Garden City, L.I., and president of Augsbury Corpration, an oil distribution company in Ogdensburg, N.Y.
