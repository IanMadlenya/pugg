        John H. Driscoll, a broadcast anthology writer who wrote a 1938 radio script for the "Cavalcade of America" series that inspired the Ronald Reagan film "Knute Rockne -- All American," died on Sunday at Cabrini Hospice in Manhattan, where he lived. He was 77 years old.
        Mr. Driscoll died of lung cancer, said his daughter, Deirdre, of Brooklyn.
        The 1940 film, starring Pat O'Brien as the legendary Notre Dame football coach and Mr. Reagan as his dying protege, George Gipp, spawned the future President's appeal to his teammates to "win one for the Gipper!" It also led to a plagiarism suit that won Mr. Driscoll $5,000.
        Mr. Driscoll, a history buff, also wrote many scripts for the "March of Time" radio series and the General Electric television anthology series. He was later a story editor and producer.
        A native of Decatur, Ill., he earned degrees at the College of the Holy Cross and Columbia University and studied with the Abbey Theater in Dublin. In World War II, he was the assistant navigator on the battleship Iowa and rose to lieutenant commander.
        Besides his daughter, he is survived by a sister, Jane Garvey of Springfield, Ill.
