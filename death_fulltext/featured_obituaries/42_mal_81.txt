        Alfred Fuchs, a retired fur broker, died on Sunday at Parkway General Hospital in North Miami Beach, Fla. He was 90 years old and lived on Bar Harbor Island, Fla.
        He died of injuries suffered in an automobile accident a week earlier in Miami Beach, a spokesman for the family said. His wife, Cecelia Frieman Fuchs, died on Saturday of injuries received in the accident.
        Mr. Fuchs was a fur dealer and broker in Manhattan for 40 years before retiring to Florida in 1955. He represented shippers of raw furs and also represented American firms at auctions in the world's major fur markets. After retiring he served as an arbitrator for the American Arbitration Association and was a small business counselor for the Federal Government.
        He is survived by two sons, Victor, of Stanford, Calif., and Lawrence, of Weston, Mass; 11 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.
