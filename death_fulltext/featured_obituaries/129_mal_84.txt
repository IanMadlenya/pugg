        J. Robert Lackey, a health-planning executive and former head of the New Jersey Health Care Facilities Financing Authority, which he helped organize, died on Tuesday at his home in Pennington, N.J. He was 71 and also had a home in Venice, Fla.
        The cause was liver cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Lackey began his career as administrator of the Health Department in East Orange, N.J., and joined the State Department of Health under Gov. William T. Cahill as executive director of the division of comprehensive health planning.
        Then, as a deputy to James R. Cowan, the Health Commissioner, he worked to establish such programs as the Certificate of Need Program (under which the need for new quarters is ascertained before funds are provided) and, in 1972, the Health Care Facilities Financing Authority. Since then, the agency has issued billions of dollars in bonds to build or modernize nonprofit hospitals and health centers. He was named executive director of the authority in 1973 and helped set up the state's Council of Hospital Financing Authorities.
        Mr. Lackey left public service in 1974 to found a consulting firm, but he returned to head the financing authority again from 1984 to 1986.
        Most recently he was a founding partner in Consumer Health Network in New Jersey. As such he was involved in the construction and management of Quality Assisted Living, a 100-bed residence under construction in Princeton, N.J.
        Mr. Lackey was born in Utica, N.Y. He served with the Army in the Pacific in World War II and graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1948. He also earned a master's degree in public health at the University of North Carolina, in 1951.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Joan Kroth; a son, Patrick F., of San Francisco, and a daughter, Carol Ann, of Audubon, N.J.
