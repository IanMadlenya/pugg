        State Senator Walter Rand, a specialist on transportation issues during his 20 years in both houses of the New Jersey Legislature, died today at Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center here. A resident of Bellmawr, a Camden suburb, he was 75.
        The Senator had been in failing health for several months with circulatory problems, his colleagues in the Legislature said.
        Mr. Rand, a Democrat, sponsored laws that created the state's Transportation Trust Fund, which pooled Federal aid, state appropriations and highway bond proceeds to pay for an accelerated road building and repair program. He also wrote the bill that led to creation of the South Jersey Transportation Authority, which cleared the way for expansion of Atlantic City International Airport.
        Mr. Rand was born in Philadelphia and attended the University of Pennsylvania. He later settled in Camden, where he served as assistant secretary and purchasing agent for the Board of Education in 1968 and 1969, and as an elected member of the board from 1971 to 1974.
        He was elected to the State Assembly in 1975 and to the Senate in 1981, where he was a former chairman of the Senate Transportation and Public Utilities Committee. He also helped find the site for the Blockbuster/Sony Music Performing Arts Center now under construction on the Camden waterfront.
        Mr. Rand is survived by his wife, the former Leah Barker, and two sons, Judge Charles M. Rand of Cherry Hill, N.J., and Robert E. Rand.
