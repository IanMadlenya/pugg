        Steven Keats, a screen, television and stage actor, who played Carol Kane's husband in the film "Hester Street," was found dead on May 8 in his Manhattan apartment. He was 48.
        He had committed suicide, said his son Thatcher, of Manhattan.
        Mr. Keats, the son of Jewish emigrants from Denmark, was born in the Bronx and grew up in Canarsie, Brooklyn. He graduated from the High School for Performing Arts in Manhattan. After serving in Vietnam with the Air Force in 1965 and 1966, he attended the Yale School of Drama and Montclair State College.
        He made his Broadway debut in 1970, in the second cast of "Oh! Calcutta." He played a spaced-out punk in the movie "The Friends of Eddie Coyle" (1973), Charles Bronson's son-in-law in "Death Wish" (1974), and Robert Shaw's Israeli sidekick in "Black Sunday" (1977). His most recent film appearance was in Woody Allen's "Shadows and Fog."
        His many television roles included ones in "The Awakening Land" and "The Executioner's Song."
        In addition to his son Thatcher, Mr. Keats is survived by a son Shane, of Manhattan, and a sister, Roberta Allen of Miller Place, L.I. His three marriages ended in divorce.
