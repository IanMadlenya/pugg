        Bernard Lustig, a retired biochemist and former director of research for Clairol, the Manhattan-based maker of cosmetics and toiletries, died on Sunday in Stamford Hospital in Connecticut. He was 92 and had lived in Stamford since 1942.
        Born in Kolomea, Austria, now Kolomyya, Ukraine, he received a doctorate in chemistry at the University of Vienna. He worked at Rudolph Hospital in Vienna until 1938, when he joined the chemistry laboratory of West London Hospital in Britain.
        He came to the United States in 1940 and joined Lawrence Richard Bruce Inc., a forerunner of Clairol. By 1945 he was Clairol's research director. He became vice president for research in 1958, and director of basic research in 1968. He retired in 1970, but continued as a consultant.
        Dr. Lustig is survived by his wife of 57 years, Frances Sachsel Lustig; two daughters, Naomi Lustig of London and Dinah Lustig of Manhattan, and one grandson.
