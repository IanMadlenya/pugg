        Herbert P. J. Marshall, a British writer whose career also embraced film making, theatrical direction and design, education and Russian literature, died Tuesday at the Homeland Nursing Home in Cowfold, West Sussex, England. He was 85 years old and had homes in West Sussex, Manhattan and Carbondale, Ill.
        The cause of death has not been determined, said his wife, Fredda.
        Mr. Marshall, who studied film making in Moscow in the 1930's with the Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein, spent the last 20 years as director of the Center for Soviet and East European Studies in the Performing Arts at the University of Southern Illinois in Carbondale. He had retired there in 1979 as distinguished professor of Soviet Literature and Theater Arts.
        Mr. Marshall also founded theatrical groups, served as director of the Old Vic Theater in London, was a consultant on theatrical architecture, and produced films and directed plays in the Soviet Union, England, Spain, India and the United States. His films include "Thunder Rock," in 1942, starring Michael Redgrave, and "Tinker," which won the Edinburgh Festival Film Award in 1949. He also translated scores of Russian poems, plays and short stories and wrote more than a dozen books and screenplays.
        In 1935 he married Fredda Brilliant, a Polish-born actress and sculptor.
        He is survived by his wife.
