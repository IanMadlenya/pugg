        The Rev. Hozen Seki, founder of the New York Buddhist Church, died on Saturday at Maui Memorial Hospital in Hawaii. He was 87 years old and had lived in Lahaina on Maui since he retired in 1983 as minister of the church.
        He died of a massive heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Seki, who was born in Kagoshima, Japan, followed his father into the Buddhist ministry when he was ordained a minister of the Nishi Hongwanji branch of the Jodo Shinshu sect, the largest in Japanese Buddhism. He graduated from Ryukoku University in Kyoto and pursued graduate studies at Ryukoku and at Columbia University.
        He came to the United States in 1930 to serve as minister of the Los Angeles Buddhist Church. He founded the Arizona Buddhist Church in 1933. Three years later he flew nonstop from the West Coast to New York in a private single-engine airplane piloted by two church members -- an unusual flight at that time, when small aircraft were not considered capable of such a feat.
        In 1937 Mr. Seki established the New York Buddhist Church, the first Buddhist religious institution chartered in New York State. In 1948 he established the American Buddhist Academy adjacent to the church on Riverside Drive at 105th Street to provide a central source for the study not only of Japanese Buddhism but also of the religion throughout the world.
        In World War II, Mr. Seki was interned with Japanese, Italian and German aliens at camps in Maryland, Idaho and New Mexico. After the war, when United States immigration and naturalization laws were changed, Mr. Seki applied for and was granted American citizenship.
        He was the author of a number of books and articles in English and Japanese on Buddhism and related topics.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Satomi Shiomasu; two sons, Hoken, of Lake Forest, Ill., and Hoshin, of Mount Vernon, N.Y., and a granddaughter.
