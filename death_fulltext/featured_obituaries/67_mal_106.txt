        Abraham H. Brodsky, a criminal defense lawyer whose career spanned 60 years, died on Monday at the Hospice of Palm Beach County in Florida. He was 87 years old and had moved from Brooklyn to West Palm Beach in 1989.
        Mr. Brodsky died of pneumonia after suffering a fall recently, said his wife, Anne.
        Mr. Brodsky, a native of Brooklyn, graduated from City College in 1919 and from Harvard Law School in 1922.
        Early in his career, he alternated work in private practice with work in the public sector. From the 1920's to the 1940's he served at various times as an assistant district attorney in Brooklyn and as an assistant attorney general for New York State. For several years in the 1930's, he was an aide to Irwin Steingut, the Speaker of the New York State Assembly.
        In the mid-1940's Mr. Brodksy returned to private practice, and he quickly developed a reputation as a formidable defense specialist. He defended reputed organized-crime figures as well as the destitute, many of whose cases he took without a fee. His style -- and his acquittal rate -- brought him recognition from other lawyers as one of the top defense lawyers practicing in New York City.
        Mr. Brodsky, a member of the American Bar Association, retired in 1982.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Judith Schneider, of New City, N.Y., and Joan Aaronson, of Atlanta; a brother, Charles, of Brooklyn; a sister, Beatrice Bernstein, of Brooklyn, and six grandchildren.
