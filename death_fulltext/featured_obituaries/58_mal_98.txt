        William John Leete, a former vice president of the Bank of New York, died on Wednesday at Pomperaug Woods Health Center, in Southbury, Conn. He was 87 years old and lived at Pomperaug Woods.
        He died of Parkinson's disease, his wife, the former Janet Stuart Smethurst, said.
        Born in Thornton Heath, England, he was sent to the United States by the Bank of South Africa in London in 1922 to learn American banking. In 1929, he joined the Bank of New York, where he remained until he retired in 1969.
        He is survived by his wife.
