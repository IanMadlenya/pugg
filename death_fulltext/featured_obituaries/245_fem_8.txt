        Julie Thoma Wright, a founder and co-owner of Wright, the Chicago auction house that helped create the market for 20th-century modern design, died on Monday in Chicago. She was 49.
        The cause was colorectal cancer, her husband, Richard Wright, said.
        Ms. Thoma Wright, an interior designer, founded Wright in Chicago in 2000 with Mr. Wright, who was at the time a private dealer in collectible 20th-century postwar design. Ms. Thoma Wright's vision for promoting the still-nascent field at auction contrasted with and eventually helped transform the traditionally dry approach at the large international houses like Phillips de Pury, Christie's and Sotheby's.
        ''She basically brought the concept of auctions into the 21st century,'' James Zemaitis, director of 20th century design at Sotheby's in New York, said of Ms. Thoma Wright. ''From the first, the catalogues looked like fashion or lifestyle magazines..''
        Auction prices for modern design now keep pace with prices for contemporary art. Ms. Thoma Wright was something of a design object herself, dressed in vintage Chanel or Herm√®s.
        Julie Christianne Thoma was born Feb. 25, 1958, in Le Mars, Iowa, one of eight children. After graduating from Iowa State University with a degree in interior design, she moved to Chicago, starting a design firm, Julie Thoma Inc., in 1985. She met Mr. Wright in 1992; they were married in 1995. Returning to residential design that year, she started a new firm, Thoma Wright Ltd.
        Her marriage to Joseph Pagoria ended in divorce. She is survived by her husband, Mr. Wright; a son, Nicholas, from her first marriage; her sons with Mr. Wright, Emerson and Adler; her mother, Gladys Thoma; her sisters, Gloria Ohlendorf, Barbara Espeland, Janet Higgins, Nancy Groetken, Glenda Lockard and Kelli Thoma; and her brother, Roger Thoma.
