        John Stubblefield, a tenor saxophonist who worked with Mary Lou Williams, Charles Mingus, Tito Puente, Miles Davis, Anthony Braxton and Abdullah Ibrahim, among other jazz musicians, died last Monday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. He was 60 and lived in Manhattan.
        He had been hospitalized since April 2004 and died of prostate cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Stubblefield learned to play piano and saxophone as a child in his home state, Arkansas. Like the jazz and blues music he loved, he moved up the Mississippi River to Chicago, where he studied at the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians with its co-founder, Muhal Richard Abrams.
        Described by his fellow saxophonist Steve Slagle as a soulful ''preacher'' of jazz and blues, Mr. Stubblefield finally settled in New York City in 1971 and played and recorded with well-known artists for more than three decades.
        For 13 years he played with the Mingus Big Band, founded by Sue Mingus to play the music of her late husband, Charles.
        Last October, Mr. Stubblefield left his hospital bed and conducted the band for a six-hour recording session from his wheelchair.
        The three songs he arranged are the centerpiece of the band's latest album, ''I Am Three,'' released in June.
        John Stubblefield Jr. was born in Little Rock, Ark., in 1945 and received a bachelor's degree in music from the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, in 1967. He began touring through the South and Midwest and recording with local artists during high school and college.
        He is survived by his wife, Katherine Gogel of Weston, Mass.; his son, John Stubblefield V of Joliet, Ill.; and his sister, Joyce Pattillo of Little Rock.
