        Joseph Frazier Wall, who chronicled the lives of Andrew Carnegie and the du Ponts, died on Monday at Grinnell General Hospital in Grinnell, Iowa. He was 75 and lived in Grinnell.
        The cause was a heart attack, said an announcement from Grinnell College, where Dr. Wall was the college's historian.
        Dr. Wall, who joined the Grinnell faculty in 1947, retired as professor emeritus in 1990, but remained active in planning the 150th anniversary activities at the college, which was founded in 1846.
        He was the author of "Andrew Carnegie" (Oxford University Press, 1970), which shed new light on one of the dominant 19th-century industrialists -- and the most complex character among them -- who went on to become the father of modern philanthropy.
        Dr. Wall spent more than 10 years conducting research in England, in Carnegie's native Scotland and in many parts of this country in pursuit of his subject. His labors were rewarded with a Bancroft Prize in American History in 1971.
        He also wrote "Alfred I. du Pont: The Man and His Family" (Oxford, 1990). With it he summarized du Pont entrepreneurship from the 1770's to the 1930's, focusing on the maverick of a larger-than-life and often quarrelsome clan.
        Born in Des Moines, he graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Grinnell in 1941. He earned his M.A. at Harvard University and a Ph.D. at Columbia University, both in American history. During a leave of absence from Grinnell in the late 1980's, he was chairman of the history department at the State University of New York at Albany.
        Dr. Wall is survived by his wife of 51 years, Beatrice Mills Wall; two daughters, April Ane Knutson of Minneapolis, and Julia Rude of Decorah, Iowa; a son, Joel, of Madison, Wis., and six grandchildren.
