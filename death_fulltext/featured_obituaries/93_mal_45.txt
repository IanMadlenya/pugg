        Dr. William L. Kraus, a leading cardiologist in Dallas, died on Friday at Parkland Memorial Hospital there. He was 72 and lived in Dallas.
        He died of cardiac arrest during emergency surgery for a broken leg he suffered in a fall the previous day, his family said.
        Dr. Kraus, a native of Germany, became associated in 1960 with St. Paul Medical Center in Dallas and directed its cardiac laboratory and electrocardiogram department, and more recently its Heart Institute, for many years.
        He practiced and taught at St. Paul until his death. He also served as a clinical professor at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Dallas.
        He was born in Augsburg, Germany, and was drafted into forced labor for the Nazis in World War II. After the war he studied at Munich University, and came to the United States as a displaced person in 1947.
        He graduated from Harvard College in 1948, received his M.D. from Harvard Medical School in 1952 and served as a captain in the Army Medical Corps in the late 1950's before settling in Dallas.
        Dr. Kraus is survived by his wife, Ann Dougherty Kraus; three sons, Thomas G., Peter A., and Stephen A., all of Dallas; a daughter, Sharon A. Kraus of Santa Fe, N.M.; a brother, Max, of Washington; a sister, Liora Seewi of Jerusalem, and three grandchildren.
