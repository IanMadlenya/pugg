        Ludwig Lustig, a manager of opera singers and other classical musicians, died on Saturday at Roosevelt Hospital. He was 94 and lived in New York City.
        During the 1960's and 70's, Mr. Ludwig managed the careers of many New York opera singers, including more than 250 City Opera members. Among the artists he represented were Beverly Sills, a client for 23 years, along with Nico Castel, Johanna Meier and Judith Raskin.
        Mr. Lustig was born and educated in Berlin. In 1938, while waiting for his immigration visa to the United States, he became the manager of the Havana Philharmonic in Cuba. There he presented such artists as Roberta Peters, Robert Merrill, Richard Tucker and Renata Tebaldi. He opened his own management office in New York in 1959 and ran the business until his retirement in 1988.
        He is survived by his wife, Isabella.
