        Robert Kleiman, a journalist specializing in foreign affairs and arms control and a former editorial writer for The New York Times, died Monday at his home in Washington. A former resident of Manhattan's Upper West Side, he was 85.
        Mr. Kleiman, who had cardiovascular problems, died in his sleep, said his wife, Mary Temple Kleiman.
        Mr. Kleiman (pronounced CLAY-man) was a native New Yorker and a 1939 Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the University of Michigan. He worked briefly as a reporter for The Washington Post and was White House correspondent for The Journal of Commerce when the country entered World War II.
        He reported from the White House for the Voice of America until the Office of War Information sent him to the Far East. In Burma, as chief of psychological warfare for the war information agency, he organized propaganda teams using leaflets and loudspeakers to persuade Japanese soldiers to surrender and local villagers not to betray downed American fliers.
        After the war he worked for U.S. News & World Report from 1945 to 1962 as associate editor, roving correspondent in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and bureau chief in West Germany. He headed the weekly's Paris bureau from 1951 to 1962, when he joined CBS News as a correspondent, commentator and Paris bureau chief.
        Mr. Kleiman joined The Times in 1963 and wrote about international affairs, principally about United States-European relations. He retired in 1985.
        He was the author of ''Atlantic Crisis: American Diplomacy Confronts a Resurgent Europe'' (Norton, 1964).
        An earlier marriage to Jane Eakin, a painter, ended in divorce.
        Besides his wife, Mr. Kleiman is survived by four stepsons and stepdaughters: Jonathan Temple of Chevy Chase, Md.; Christopher Temple of Kaslo, British Columbia; Tracy Russell of Sonora, Calif.; and Laurie Temple of Portland, Ore.
