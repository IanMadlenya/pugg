        Gregg Rice, a former professor of biology at Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., died Jan. 19 in Mount Vernon, N.Y. He was 59 and a longtime resident of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.
        The cause was Alzheimer's, said his wife, Laura.
        Professor Rice was born in Manhattan and grew up in Vineland, N.J. He received a bachelor's degree from Princeton University and a doctorate in biology from the University of Rochester.
        He kept in good shape by playing basketball. But in 1997 he learned that he had Alzheimer's. He taught at Mercy College until May of that year and tried unsuccessfully to volunteer as a subject for a study of the disease. Professor Rice's battle with early-onset Alzheimer's disease was the subject of a feature article in the Westchester section of The New York Times two years ago.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Elizabeth Rice of Manhattan and Anne Rice, also of Hastings-on-Hudson, and a brother, Gary, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
