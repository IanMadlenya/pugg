        Franco Piga, the State Industry Minister who recently mediated a battle for control of Italy's chemical industry, has died of a heart attack, his family said today. He was 63 years old.
        Mr. Piga died while an ambulance was taking him to a hospital late Wednesday night in the Dolomite resort of Cortina D'Ampezzo, the family said.
        A Christian Democrat, Mr. Piga received the State Industry post in Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti's Government in July, after five ministers quit in a political dispute.
        He served as head of the regulatory agency for the Italian stock market, Consob, from 1984 to 1988.
