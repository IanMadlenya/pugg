        Teddy Randazzo, who with Bobby Weinstein and others wrote hundreds of popular songs like ''Goin' Out of My Head'' and ''It's Gonna Take a Miracle,'' died on Friday at his home in Orlando. He was 68.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Mr. Weinstein, his longtime friend and songwriting partner.
        Together with Mr. Weinstein and others, Mr. Randazzo wrote hits like ''Hurt So Bad,'' which were performed by groups ranging from the Temptations to Little Anthony and the Imperials and by singers ranging from Frank Sinatra to Queen Latifah.
        A native of Brooklyn, Alessandro Carmelo Randazzo began his musical career at 15, when he became lead singer and accordion player of a group called the Three Chuckles. They had a hit with ''Runaround,'' which rose to No. 20 on the Billboard charts. After leaving the group, Mr Randazzo continued a career a solo performer, appearing on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' seven times.
        Mr. Randazzo met Mr. Weinstein in the late 1950's, and their first collaboration, ''Pretty Blue Eyes,'' became a No. 1 hit for Steve Lawrence.
        In addition to writing and singing, Mr. Randazzo appeared in a number of movies, including ''Hey, Let's Twist,'' ''Mr. Rock and Roll'' and ''Rock, Rock, Rock,'' a cameo-packed relic of the early rock 'n' roll era, featuring Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, Frankie Lymon and Tuesday Weld in her screen debut.
        Mr. Randazzo is survived by his wife, Shelly; his sons Alika, Joshua, Giovanni and Teddy Jr.; and his daughters, Skye, Dominique and Elisa Rose Schwartz.
