        James R. Cogan, a lawyer who specialized in trusts and estates and was a volunteer for nonprofit organizations, died on Friday at his Manhattan apartment. He was 69.
        His death was due to lung cancer, according to his wife, Arrial.
        Mr. Cogan began his legal career in 1953 at the firm of Sullivan & Cromwell and moved to Alexander & Green in 1957, where he became a partner five years later. That firm merged with Walter, Conston & Schurtman in 1987 to become Walter, Conston, Alexander & Green. Mr. Cogan was a partner there until last year, when he stepped down because of his illness.
        Mr. Cogan, who donated his time to a number of nonprofit organizations, was chairman of the board of the Windham Foundation, which supports preservation of a 210-year-old hamlet in Vermont. He was a director of the Charlotte Palmer Phillips Foundation, which awards educational and research grants. He also helped raise money for the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem and for the St. Thomas Choir School in New York. Mr. Cogan was an alumnus of the school.
        He served as a U.S. Army medic in Japan from 1946 to 1947, received a bachelor's degree from Yale University in 1950 and received his law degree from Columbia University in 1953.
        In addition to his wife of 42 years, he is survived by two daughters, Sarah E., of Manhattan and Julia Finney of Philadelphia; a son, George W., of Menlo Park, Calif., and seven grandchildren.
