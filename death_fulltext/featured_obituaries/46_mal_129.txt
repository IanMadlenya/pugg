        John J. Bauer, a high school football coach whose teams set a state record for consecutive victories, died of heart failure on Wednesday. He was 67 years old.
        Mr. Bauer, whose Randolph High School teams won six state championships, had been undergoing treatment for a kidney ailment for the last year. Early in the season, Randolph's team broke the New Jersey record of 40 consecutive victories set by Memorial of West New York in the 1950's. His team posted victory No. 46 last Sunday, giving Bauer a 191-44-3 record in 25 seasons at Randolph High.
