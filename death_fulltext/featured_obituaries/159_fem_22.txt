        Betsy Dworkin, a former senior lecturer in social policy and administration at the University of London's Chelsea and University colleges, died yesterday at her home in Greenwich Village. She would have been 67 today.
        The cause was cancer, said her husband, Ronald Dworkin.
        Mrs. Dworkin was born in Manhattan to Walter and Adelaide Ross.
        She received a bachelor's degree magna cum laude in 1955 from Radcliffe College, where she studied American history and literature, and she was a Fulbright Scholar in Paris. She received a master's degree in the history of fine arts in 1957 from Harvard.
        She went on to be a writer on the staff of the Metropolitan Museum, an associate editor of Art News and managing editor of a sister publication, the quarterly Portfolio. In 1962, she moved to New Haven, where she helped run a poverty program in the public school system.
        In 1969, she moved to Britain, where in 1972 she received a second master's degree, this one in social policy, from the London School of Economics. From 1972 to 1989 she taught at Chelsea and University colleges.
        In addition to her husband, Professor Ronald Dworkin, who teaches at New York University and at the University of London's University College, she is survived by a son, Anthony of London; and a daughter, Jennifer Dworkin of Manhattan.
