        Mujaddid Ahmed Ijaz, a nuclear scientist and professor emeritus of physics at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg, died Thursday at his home in Shawsville, Va. He was 55 years old.
        His family said he died from brain and lung cancer.
        Dr. Ijaz, a native of Lahore, Pakistan, trained there at Government College and came to the United States in 1960. He received a Master of Science degree from Florida State University and a Ph.D. in physics from Ohio University before joining the Virginia Polytechnic faculty in 1964. He published more than 60 papers about sub-atomic particles and did research on new particles at Oak Ridge National Laboratories in Tennessee.
        He was chairman of the Al Ijaz Trust, a philanthropy registered in Virginia and Islamabad, Pakistan. It provides scholarships for third-world students. The trust will now be headed by his wife and eldest son.
        Dr. Ijaz, who also had a home in Manhattan, is survived by his wife, Princess Lubna Razia bin Nazir Ijaz; four sons, Musawer Mansoor of Manhattan, Farouk Ahmed of Charlotte, N.C., Atif Javed of Akron, Ohio, and Mujeeb Ismael of Detroit; a daughter, Neelam Rubina Ajiz of Shawsville, and seven grandchildren.
