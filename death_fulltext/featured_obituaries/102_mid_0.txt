        Helen J. Boiardi, who helped to launch the Chef Boyardee line of prepared pasta dinners, died on Monday at her home in Shaker Heights, Ohio. She was 90.
        In the 1920's she and her husband, Hector Boiardi, a successful chef, opened a restaurant in Cleveland's financial district. Its spaghetti dinners proved so savory that customers asked for portions of pasta, sauce and cheese to take home.
        The popularity prompted the Boiardis to go into the packaged food business full time under the Chef Boiardi label in the 1930's. Mr. Boiardi explained that the product name was changed to the phonetic spelling because customers and salesmen had trouble pronouncing his name.
        "Everyone is proud of his own family name, but sacrifices were necessary for progress," he said at the time.
        The company was sold in 1946 to American Home Food Products of Madison, N.J., a subsidiary of American Home Products.
        Mrs. Boiardi is survived by a son, Mario, of Queenstown, Md.; two sisters, a brother, two grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. Hector Boiardi died 10 years ago at 87.
