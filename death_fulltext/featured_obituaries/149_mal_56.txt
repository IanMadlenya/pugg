        John Lloyd, a British archeologist who unearthed relics yielding new information about day-to-day living in classical times, died on May 30 in Oxford, England. He was 51 and had worked with Oxford University's Institute of Archeology for a decade.
        He had a brain tumor, said The Independent, which reported his death on Wednesday. .
        Fieldwork by Mr. Lloyd ''has given us new understanding for ordinary life in towns and villages and farms throughout the ancient world,'' Prof. Graeme Barker, head of Leicester University's School of Archeological Studies, wrote last week.
        In the 1970's, Mr. Lloyd was field director of excavations at the site of the old-time Greek and Roman city of Berenice in what is now a suburb of Benghazi, a port on Libya's Mediterranean coast. That work produced insights into many facets of life in Berenice, which was given that name under the Greeks in the third century B.C. and was acquired by the Romans in the first century B.C.
        Later Mr. Lloyd and others sought information about the ancient history of the Biferno River valley in  Italy. That project included squads of archeologists walking present-day farmers' fields in search of bits of old pottery and other remnants of life in the valley in classical times.
        In a 1981 article he reported that such ''field-walking archeology'' by ''survey archeologists' had revealed an undreamed-of ''busy countryside'' of farms, residences and communities in what are now nations all around the Mediterranean.
        Born in Broughty Ferry, Scotland, he graduated from Manchester University. He went on to be a lecturer successively at Sheffield and Oxford universities from 1977 to 1988 and a fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford,  from 1988 to 1999.
        He married Vicky Doughty in 1976, and they had a son and a daughter..
