        Capt. James O. Houghton, commanding officer of the Naval Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory, died in an automobile accident Thursday, the police said. He was 45 years old.
        Captain Houghton was killed when his car collided head-on with a speeding car that had veered into his lane, said Officer Venus North of the Florida Highway Patrol.
        Captain Houghton had commanded the laboratory at the Pensacola Naval Air Station since June 1985. On July 1, he was to have begun overseeing medical research and development at the Naval Medical Command in Washington.
        He did research into the human body's reaction to gravitational tolerance in high-performance aircraft in the early 1980's, said Lieut. Cmdr. Tom Fleischman.
        Born in Littlefield, Tex., he graduated from Union College in Nebraska and earned his medical degree at Loma Linda University in California. He was designated a naval flight surgeon in 1970.
        He served with the First and Third Marine Air Wings in Santa Ana, Calif.; Da Nang, South Vietnam; and Futenma, Okinawa.
        Captain Houghton is survived by three brothers and three sisters.
