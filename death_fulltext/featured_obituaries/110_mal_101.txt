        Louis Pataki, a former assistant postmaster in Peekskill, N.Y., who saw his son elected to the highest office in the state, died on Saturday at a nursing home in Hudson, N.Y., from complications following a heart attack. He was 83.
        Mr. Pataki, father of Gov. George E. Pataki, began his career with the Peekskill Post Office as a letter carrier during the Depression and, over the next 30 years, rose to become assistant postmaster before retiring.
        Mr. Pataki simultaneously helped manage his family's farm in Peekskill. He served as Peekskill's first Environmental Commissioner and as chairman of the Peekskill Bicentennial Celebration. But his greatest love was for the Peekskill  Fire Department, with which he served as a volunteer for more than 50 years.
        "No one cared more or did more for his family and community than our father," Governor Pataki said yesterday on behalf of himself and other family members. "We owe everything to him and we will miss him enormously."
        Mr. Pataki's volunteer work as a firefighter briefly became an issue in his son's gubernatorial campaign when it was disclosed that he had been placed in a  nursing home for indigent volunteer firefighters despite the fact that he had once had considerable financial assets, stemming from the farm, that were transferred to his sons.
        In addition to Governor Pataki, Mr. Pataki is survived by his wife, Peggy; another son, Louis Jr., of Norwalk, Conn.; a brother, George, of San Raphael, Calif.; a sister, Zelma Senk of Rochester, and six grandchildren.
