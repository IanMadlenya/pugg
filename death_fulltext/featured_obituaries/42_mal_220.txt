        Astere E. Claeyssens, a professor of English at George Washington University, died Thursday at St. Joseph's Hospital in Chicago, where he was visiting. He was 66 years old and lived in Washington.
        Mr. Claeyssens, who was hospitalized for complications from a liver transplant he received in 1986, died of pneumonia, a spokesman for the university said.
        He joined the faculty at George Washington in 1965 as associate professor and became a full professor in 1984.
        He was also the producer, director, writer and star of ''One to One,'' a series of 20 programs on literature produced for public television, for which he received an Emmy in 1969. He also wrote ''Words and Music; An Introduction to American Musical Theater,'' published in 1982 by the National Endowment for the Humanities.
        Mr. Claeyssens was born in Waukegan, Ill., and graduated from the University of Illinois. He received an M.A. in American literature from Columbia University, and taught at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
        He is survived by a sister, Joan Gray of Littleton, Colo.
