        Arthur Loew Jr., a comedian who became a film writer and producer, died on Friday at his home in Amado, Ariz. He was 69 and had recently begun treatment for lung cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Loew worked as a newspaper drama critic and sports reporter in the late 1940's before heading to California. Among the films he produced were "The Rack," starring Paul Newman, "The Affairs of Dobie Gillis," with Debbie Reynolds, and "Penelope," starring Natalie Wood.
        Mr. Loew was a member of a film dynasty. His maternal grandfather, Adolph Zukor, founded Paramount Pictures. His paternal grandfather, Marcus Loew, founded Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios and Loew's Theaters, and his father, Arthur  Loew Sr., was a president of M-G-M.
        Mr. Loew's first marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his second wife, Regina, four sons and two daughters.
