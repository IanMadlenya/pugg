        William R. Hesse, an advertising executive who headed one of the nation's largest agencies and the American Association of Advertising Agencies, died Tuesday at his home in Yarmouthport, Mass. He was 80.
        The cause was heart failure, said Charles Stackhouse, his son-in-law.
        Mr. Hesse, a native of Dayton, Ohio, began his career in 1937 at the Proctor & Gamble Company, but left in 1941 to supervise several advertising accounts at Batton, Barton, Durstine & Osborn's Pittsburgh office. In 1948, he moved to the agency's New York office and was named vice president and management supervisor, taking charge of accounts including Lever Brothers and Campbell Soup.
        In 1956, Mr. Hesse joined Benton & Bowles, now D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, as a vice president. He was elected to the board of directors in the same year and in 1958 became executive vice president. In 1961, he was named president of Benton & Bowles and then, four years later, was appointed its chief executive.
        In 1967, he resigned as chief executive of Benton & Bowles and formed his own consulting firm, W. R. Hesse Associates. In 1975, he joined the American Association of Advertising Agencies, a national trade association, as senior vice president in its Washington, D.C., office. Three years later, Mr. Hesse was named interim president, a position he held until 1980 when a new president was named.
        Mr. Hesse is survived by his wife, Anne Vandervort Hesse; a daughter, Carole Ann Stackhouse of New Canaan, Conn.; two sons, Mark V. of Hyannis, Mass., and William R. of San Jose, Calif., and three grandchildren.
