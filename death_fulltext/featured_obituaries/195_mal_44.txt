        Glenn Savan, whose popular first novel, ''White Palace'' (1987), was about a St. Louis waitress's mismatched romance with an ad man, died on Monday at his home in Shrewsbury, Mo. He was 49.
        The cause was either a heart attack or stroke, his family said.
        Mr. Savan's book was about a recently widowed man with fussy attitudes and his Pygmalion-like embroilment with a slatternly waitress 14 years his senior who works at a White Palace hamburger joint. The complicated relationship eventually transforms both of them. The book, which became a best seller, was originally published as a Bantam paperback, the first title in a Bantam line of contemporary fiction.
        The 1990 movie based on the novel starred James Spader and Susan Sarandon. Mr. Savan wrote the movie script with Ted Tally and made a cameo appearance in the film.
        He wrote a second novel, ''Goldman's Anatomy'' (Doubleday, 1993), about a romantic triangle in which one of the three was an introspective bookworm forced to rely on crutches by a childhood disease. Mr. Savan himself had suffered since boyhood with what was eventually diagnosed as Parkinson's disease as well as with degenerative joint ailments.
        Glenn Savan grew up in St. Louis and attended Webster University there. He received a master's degree at the University of Iowa Writer's Workshop in 1982. He waited on tables at a St. Louis restaurant at night for the three years it took him to complete ''White Palace.''
        Mr. Savan is survived by his father, Sidney, and stepmother, Barbara Savan; a sister, Leslie Savan of New York; and two stepbrothers, Eric Leslie and Joe Leslie.
