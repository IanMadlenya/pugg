        Michael Dyne, a playwright who also wrote many dramas and comedies for television, died Wednesday at his home in Linlithgo, N.Y. He was 70 years old and had colon and liver cancer.
        Mr. Dyne's 1965 play, ''The Right Honourable Gentleman,'' about a political scandal in Victorian England, ran for three years in London and 118 performances on Broadway at the Billy Rose Theater.
        Michael Bradley Dyne was born in London on Aug. 19, 1918, the son of Musgrave Bradley Dyne, a sculptor. He was privately educated in France and Switzerland, was an actor and writer in Canada, and came to the United States in 1938.
        He acted in films at Paramount and at 20th Century-Fox and was later assigned by Darryl Zanuck to coach and prepare actresses for screen tests.
        Starting in 1949, Mr. Dyne wrote 25 plays for ''Studio One'' and was a regular contributor to ''The Alcoa Hour,'' ''Kraft Theater,'' ''Playhouse 90'' and other shows.
        From 1952 to 1970, he wrote more than 150 dramas for the television networks, including adaptations of Henry James, Pirandello and Thomas Hardy.
        Mr. Dyne wrote a series of movies for Walt Disney, including ''The Moon-Spinners'' and ''I Captured the Castle,'' and wrote several two-hour television adaptations of Dickens dramas for the producer David Susskind.
        There are no survivors.
