        Robert S. Fisher, who retired in 1975 as chairman and chief executive after 44 years with the Hubinger Company, a corn refiner in Keokuk, Iowa, died Nov. 15 at his home in Key Largo, Fla. He was 84 years old.
        His family said he died of cancer.
        Mr. Fisher graduated from Colgate University in 1930, the year before he joined Hubinger, a maker of starch, syrup and other corn products. He retired when the company was bought by the H. J. Heinz Company, which turned it into a subsidiary. Heinz sold the company to the Roquette Group of France this year.
        An avid pilot, Mr. Fisher logged more than 21,000 flight hours, many of them in World War II on antisubmarine patrol and then as an Air Force captain in Africa, Europe and the Far East. In 1953, he flew a small Aero Commander from Iowa to London, Paris, Rome and back, a notable feat aboard a light aircraft back then.
        Mr. Fisher is survived by his wife, Ruth Jones Fisher; a daughter, Lynn Lee of Santa Fe, N.M., and five grandchildren.
