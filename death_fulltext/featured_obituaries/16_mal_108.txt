        Fei Yi-ming, a Hong Kong publisher who was one of China's top advisers in this British colony, died of a stroke Wednesday, his newspaper reported today. He was 80 years old.
        Mr. Fei was a member of China's parliament, the National People's Congress, and a vice chairman of the committee that has been drafting a constitution for Hong Kong after it reverts to Chinese rule in 1997.
        Since 1948 he had published Ta Kung Pao, a pro-Beijing newspaper here.
        Doctors were sent from Beijing by Gen. Yang Shangkun, President of China, when Mr. Fei became ill in December.
