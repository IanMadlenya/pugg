        Mr. Ekern, 36 years old, joined the Rams in 1976 after attending San Jose State University and played with them for 13 years before retiring after the 1988 season.
        Funeral services will be held Tuesday near San Jose, and the Rams also said that a memorial service for Mr. Ekern may be conducted later this month when the team returns from playing an exhibition game in West Germany.
