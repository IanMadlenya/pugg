        Bobby Locke, a top international golfer in the late 1940's and 1950's and a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame, died in a nursing home Monday night. He was 69 years old.
        The South African Press Association said Mr. Locke died of meningitis, an inflammation of membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. He entered the nursing home Sunday and went into a coma, five days after presenting an award at a golfing dinner here.
        Mr. Locke won the British Open in 1949, 1950, 1952 and 1957, and took Open titles in West Germany, France, Switzerland, Canada, New Zealand and Egypt during his career. An auto accident in the early 1960's ended his competitive career.
