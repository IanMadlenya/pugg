        Oscar Dombrow, a retired New York City educator who developed innovative school programs, died on Tuesday at Boca Raton Community Hospital in Florida. He was 86 and lived in Boca Raton and Westport, Conn.
        Pneumonia was the cause of death, his family said.
        His career with the city's Board of Education spanned 47 years. In 1970, he was promoted to assistant superintendent in charge of high schools in Brooklyn. He retired in 1975.
        He headed a committee that in 1971 issued a report, "Toward the 21st Century," encouraging schools to experiment with curriculum and techniques.
        He developed two new programs. One, at John Dewey High School, expanded the traditional school day to eight hours. The other was "City as School," in which students earned credits while working in business, civic and cultural organizations.
        Earlier, he was principal of Junior High School 115 and Straubenmuller Textile High School (later Charles Evans Hughes) in Manhattan and James Monroe High School in the Bronx.
        Mr. Dombrow was born in New York City. After graduating from City College, he earned a master's degree in history from Columbia. He wrote several history textbooks.
        His first and second wives, Nettie Maslow and Isabel Smith, are deceased.
        He is survived by his wife of 11 years, the former Libby Simon; a daughter, Karen Fine of Warren, N.J.; a son, Anthony, of Chicago; a brother, Bernard, of Lakewood, N.J.; two sisters, Therma Princer of Madison, Wis., and Sylvia Goldstein of Seattle, and four grandchildren.
