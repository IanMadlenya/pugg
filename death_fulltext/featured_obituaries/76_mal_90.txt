        Dr. Alfred Ebel, professor emeritus at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and chief of clinical services for rehabilitative medicine at Montefiore Hospital, died on Monday at the Bronx Veterans Administration Hospital. He was 86 and lived in Yonkers.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, his family said.
        Dr. Ebel's work in physical medicine and rehabilitation stressed the role of exercise in relieving the effects of vascular disease. He also contributed to his specialty's management of spinal-cord injuries and paraplegia.
        A native of Bielitz, Austria, now Biala-Bielsko, Poland, he received his medical education at Long Island College of Medicine. He held various positions as an Army medical officer and retired as a colonel and chief of physical medicine and rehabilitation at the Veterans Administration Bronx hospital in 1967.
        His affiliation with Albert Einstein began in 1955 as an associate clinical professor. He was promoted to professor in 1967 and reached emeritus status in 1975. At Montefiore, he served as chief of clinical services in the Division of Rehabilitation Medicine from 1967 until his retirement 17 years later.
        Dr. Ebel is survived by his wife of 56 years, Rose Dresnick Ebel; two daughters, Judith Ebel Tsipis of Boston, and Deborah Ebel Young of Atlanta, and four grandchildren.
