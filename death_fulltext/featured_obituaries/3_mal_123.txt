        John E. Silkin, a former Cabinet minister and veteran Member of Parliament for the Labor Party, died Sunday at his home here. He was 64 years old and no cause of death was given.
        Mr. Silkin - the youngest son of the late Lord Silkin, Minister of Town and Country Planning in the Labor Government of 1945 to 1950 - joined the Labor Party at the age of 16. He became a lawyer and lost three elections before entering the House of Commons in 1963.
        He represented Deptford, in southeast London, but had announced that he would not seek re-election.
        Mr. Silkin opposed Britain's membership in the European Community. He was chief Government whip from 1966 to 1969 and served as deputy leader of the Commons for part of that time. Between 1969 and 1979 he served as Minister of Public Buildings and Works, Minister of Planning and Local Government, and Minister of Agriculture.
        In 1980, Mr. Silkin ran against Michael Foot for leadership of the Labor Party, but was defeated on the first ballot.
        Mr. Silkin is survived by his wife, Rosamund, and a son.
