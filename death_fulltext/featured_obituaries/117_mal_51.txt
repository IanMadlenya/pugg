        Walter Sencer, a neurologist and psychiatrist long associated with Mount Sinai Hospital and School of Medicine, died at the hospital on Monday. He was 75 and lived on the Upper East Side, where he was in private practice for the last 38 years.
        The cause was cancer, the family said.
        At his death, Dr. Sencer was a clinical professor of neurology and psychiatry at Mount Sinai and chief of neurology at the Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged. Over the years, he also taught and cared for patients at Beth Israel Medical Center, Cornell Medical Center, New York University School of Medicine and the Family Institute.
        A native of Manhattan, he graduated in 1942 from City College and received his M.D. from New York University four years later. He trained in psychoanalysis at Columbia University.
        At Mount Sinai, where he started as an intern in 1952, he was the first administrator of the Department of Neurology before embarking on his long career as an attending physician and teacher.
        Dr. Sencer is survived by his wife, Helene Galanty Sencer. Also surviving are two sons and a daughter from previous marriages, Philip, of Chicago, Nicholas, of Portland, Ore., and Claudia Sencer of Charlottesville, Va., and two grandsons.
