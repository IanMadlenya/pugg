        Nackey Scripps Loeb, former publisher of two influential conservative newspapers, The Union Leader and The New Hampshire Sunday News of Manchester, N.H., died on Saturday at her home in Goffstown, N.H. She was 75.
        Her health had deteriorated recently, partly because of complications from injuries in a 1977 car accident, The Associated Press reported.
        Mrs. Loeb was a granddaughter of E. W. Scripps, a major figure in the creation of what became the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain.
        She retired in May after 18 years as publisher of the New Hampshire newspapers, which are the state's largest, and as president of the Union Leader Corporation.
        She had succeeded her husband of 29 years, William Loeb, who bought the papers in the 1940's and died in 1981.
        The papers' influence stems partly from the outspoken role they play in their state's widely watched presidential primaries.
        ''We mourn her passing,'' said Steve Forbes, a Republican presidential contender who has won the endorsement of the newspapers. ''Let us be guided by her spirit.''
        Mrs. Loeb could be pungently partisan. On the day when President Clinton visited New Hampshire soon after his acquittal on impeachment charges, a front-page editorial, written by her, had the headline, ''Don't Come Back, Kid.''
        She was a native of Los Angeles and attended Scripps College in Claremont, Calif.
        Her survivors include two daughters, Nackey Scagliotti of Boothbay Harbor, Me., and Edith Tomasko of Hopkinton, N.H.; three brothers, Robert Scripps of Fredericksburg, Tex., Charles E. Scripps of Cincinnati and Samuel H. Scripps of Rhinebeck, N.Y., and three grandchildren.
