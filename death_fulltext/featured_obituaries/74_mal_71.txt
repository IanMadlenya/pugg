        Theodore Pearson, a lawyer and former officer of the City Bar Association in New York, died on Thursday at the Isabella Geriatric Center in Manhattan. A resident of West Redding, Conn., he was 89.
        Death was caused by complications resulting from a stroke that he suffered in September, his family said.
        Born in Weston, Mass., he was a 1925 graduate of Harvard University, where he also earned his law degree. He was admitted to the New York bar in 1928.  Among the posts he held at the City Bar Association was chairman of its Committee on Federal Legislation from 1951 to 1954. A registered Republican, he helped persuade the bar to oppose the Bricker Amendment, introduced in 1953 by Senator John Bricker, Republican of Ohio.
        Its backers sought to curb the President's executive power by leaving to Congress and even state legislatures the internal enforcement of international agreements. Mr. Pearson testified against it on behalf of the city bar. Though the subject of long and heated debate, the amendment failed to come to a vote.
        Mr. Pearson was a past president of the Greater New York Fund and of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies.
        He is survived by two daughters, Victoria Miller and Laura Pruyn, both of Manhattan; a son, Theodore Jr., of San Diego; two brothers, Robert, of West Newbury, Mass., and Henry, of Wayland, Mass., and five grandchildren.
