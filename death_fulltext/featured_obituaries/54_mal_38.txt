        Dr. John M. Astrachan, who had practices in obstetrics and gynecology and in psychiatry for many years, died in his sleep on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 62 years old.
        He apparently died of a heart attack, his family said.
        Dr. Astrachan was born in Manhattan and was a graduate of Alfred University and the New York Medical College. He held residencies at Metropolitan Hospital in obstetrics and gynecology and at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in psychiatry. He was an associate professor at the Cornell Medical College.
        Dr. Astrachan is survived by his wife, the former Margot Weiss, and two sons, Gregory and Matthew, both of Manhattan.

        An obituary on Saturday of John M. Astrachan misstated the nature of his medical practice. Dr. Astrachan was an associate professor of psychiatry in obstetrics and gynecology and an attending physician at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. He had a private psychiatric practice in Manhattan.
