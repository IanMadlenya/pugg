        Stuart W. Thayer, a New York lawyer who specialized in international finance, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 66 years old.
        The cause of death was cancer, his family said.
        He retired in February as a partner in Sullivan & Cromwell after managing its London office for three years. He opened the London office in 1972 and was the partner in charge of it until 1976, when he returned to Manhattan.
        He was a descendant of one of West Virginia's first colonial families. His studies at Princeton were interrupted by wartime service in the Navy in the Pacific, where he was assigned as an ensign to the Bikini atomic-bomb test site in the Marshall Islands in 1946.
        He graduated from Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs in 1947 and was an intern at the National Institute of Public Affairs. He graduated in 1951 from Yale Law School, where he was editor in chief of the Law Journal.
        He was a law clerk to Justice Tom C. Clark of the United States Supreme Court. After practicing law in Washington and Charleston, he moved to New York in 1956 to join Sullivan & Cromwell. He became a partner in 1960.
        He is survived by his wife of 43 years, the former Ann Hart; two daughters, Janet Thayer Kiczek of Manhattan, and Lucy Lucero of Santa Clara, Calif.; three sons, Mark, of Manhattan, David, of Brooklyn, and Peter, also of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
