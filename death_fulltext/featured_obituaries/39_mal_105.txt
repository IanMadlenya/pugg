        Larry Peyton King, a composer and organist who was the music director at Trinity Church in lower Manhattan for 21 years, died Thursday at his family's home in Fullerton, Calif. He was 58 years old.
        He died of malignant melanoma, family members said.
        One of his compositions was a tribute to the 1976 United States Bicentennial, ''The American Dream,'' which he played on the Trinity Church 9,000-pipe organ, accompanied by various percussion instruments. In 1978 on a commission from Riverside Church he composed ''Fanfare to the Tongues of Fire,'' a work designed to demonstrate a new organ stop known as trumpet-en-chamade. He also composed choral music, mass settings and anthems.
        Mr. King was a graduate of Redlands University in California and received a master's degree in sacred music at Union Theological Seminary. He studied organ at the Royal Academy of Music in London on a Fulbright scholarship.
        He joined Trinity Church in 1968 and retired last fall. He had been the music director at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in San Diego for five years.
        He is survived by his mother, Dorothy, and a brother, Robert, both of Fullerton.
