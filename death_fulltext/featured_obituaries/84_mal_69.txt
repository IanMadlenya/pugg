        Lieut. Gen. Charles B. Duff, an anti-aircraft specialist who was once responsible for the Army air defenses of New York City, died on Monday at Penrose Hospital in Colorado Springs. He was 85.
        The cause was a respiratory infection, said Ruth Rouss, his attorney.
        General Duff graduated from West Point in 1931. He commanded artillery units in the Pacific during World War II. After the war he served in Washington on the War Department's general staff, with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Industrial College of the Armed Forces. He served three tours of duty as a budget expert in the Pentagon and in 1962 he was the Controller of the Army.
        In the 1950's, he was the commanding general of the New York Anti-Aircraft Defense with headquarters at Fort Wadsworth, Staten Island. He was also commanding general of the First Region, Army Air Defense Command.
        His command included the 526th Missile Battalion, 52d Artillery Brigade. In 1958, eight of its Nike Ajax missiles exploded at its base in Middletown, N.J. Ten men were killed and three injured in the blasts, which shook an area for several miles around. The explosions took place when civilian technicians and soldiers were installing new arming mechanisms.
        In 1963, General Duff became commander of the Army Air Defense Command of the North American Air Defense Command in Colorado Springs. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for his performance in that position. After 35 years in the Army he retired in 1966 and continued to live in Colorado Springs.
        General Duff is survived by his wife, Sallie Edmondson Duff of Colorado Springs; a son, Christopher B., of Pine, Colo.; four grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
