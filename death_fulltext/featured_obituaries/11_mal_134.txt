He was 82 years old.
        Dr. Bergel, a native of Germany who was opposed to Hitler, was involved in a much-publicized dispute in the 1930's with the chairman of the German department, a Nazi sympathizer, at Rutgers University. Dr. Bergel was then an instructor under the chairman, Friedrich J. Hauptmann.
        Dr. Bergel, who was dismissed by the university for incompetence in 1935, asserted that his removal was the result of political discrimination. Fifty-one years later, a special Rutgers faculty committee upheld his dismissal and rejected arguments that differences over German politics had led to his removal, although it concluded that ''political considerations probably played a role.''
        He is survived by his wife, Sylvia, and a son, Thomas, also of Port Washington.
