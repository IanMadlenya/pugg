        John Bratby, an English painter and writer whose canvases were featured in the 1958 film "The Horse's Mouth," died on Monday outside his home in Hastings, England. He was 64 years old.
        He died of a heart attack while out walking, said his wife, Patti.
        Mr. Bratby was born on July 19, 1928. He attended the Royal College of Art in London, and came to fame in the early 1950's as a founder of the Kitchen-Sink School, a movement that was at first hailed but later dismissed by English critics. His thick-surfaced figurative paintings and portraits sometimes incorporated beer bottles, trash cans and other everyday objects. Aggressive and gritty, they were often seen as part of the "Angry Young Men" movement initiated in the 1950's by the playwright John Osborne.
        They also lent an air of bohemian veracity to Gulley Jimson, the artist played by Alec Guinness in "The Horse's Mouth." Mr. Bratby's paintings were used also in "Mistral's Daughter," a 1984 television mini-series about an artist, adapted from a Judith Krantz novel.
        In 1961 Mr. Bratby published a novel, "Breakdown," about a painter whose art and personality were remarkably like his own. In 1987, he became editor in chief of Art Quarterly. Although Mr. Bratby's career was eclipsed by the rise of abstract art in the 1960's, he had a drawing retrospective at the National Portrait Gallery in 1991. His work is represented in many British, European and American collections, including the Tate Gallery and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by the children of his first marriage, to the English painter Jean Cooke: three sons, David, Jason and Dayan, and a daughter, Wendy, all of Blackheath, England.
