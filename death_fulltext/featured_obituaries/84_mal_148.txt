        Robert E. Matteson, a Government specialist in disarmament and intelligence from 1953 to 1972, died on Monday at his home in St. Paul. He was 79.
        The cause was complications from Parkinson's disease, said a grandson, Elliott Donnelley.
        In Washington, Mr. Matteson served with the Foreign Operations Administration, the National Security Council and the Agency of International Development.
        He is survived by his wife, Jane; three sons, Robert E. Jr., Fredric L. and Sumner W., and two daughters, Adelaide Donnelley and Elizabeth Matteson.
