        Sam Fry Jr., one of the top-ranked bridge players in the United States, died on Friday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. He was 82 years old.
        He had been suffering from pneumonia, his wife, Camilla, said.
        In 1936 Mr. Fry was one of 10 experts named to the new rank of life master on the basis of tournament results by the American Bridge League. At 27 he was the youngest of a group that included such stars as Oswald Jacoby, Howard Schenken, Waldemar Von Zedtwitz and B. Jay Becker. Mr. Fry was the last surviving member of that group.
        Mr. Fry had already won five national titles at that time. He went on to win the Spingold Knockout Teams three times, in 1937, 1941 and 1945, and the Vanderbilt Knockout Teams once, in 1958. As a result of the Vanderbilt victory he represented the United States in the 1959 world championship, in which his team finished second to the Italian Blue Team. He was second in seven national events, and was a three-time winner of the Reisinger Knockout Teams at the Eastern Regional Championships.
        Mr. Fry was the author of "How to Win at Bridge With Any Partner." He also updated a classic work, "Play of the Hand at Bridge," by one of his early partners, Louis Watson. From 1932 to 1966 he was a contributing editor of The Bridge World, and from 1956 to 1980 he was the secretary of the Regency Whist Club in Manhattan.
        Mr. Fry graduated from Columbia University in 1928 and bridge became his career. From 1943 to 1945 he was a management analyst in the Army Service Forces.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Robert, of Pawlet, Vt., and a grandson.
