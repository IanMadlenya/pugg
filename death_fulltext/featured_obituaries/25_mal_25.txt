        Mr. Prentice, whose given names were Pierrepont Isham but who was known throughout his life as P. I. or Perry, was born in Newark and graduated in 1920 from Yale, where he was a classmate of Henry Luce, the co-founder of Time.
        He began his journalistic career as a reporter for The New York Tribune and held editing jobs on newspapers in Camden, N.J., New Bedford, Mass., and Philadelphia.
        In 1930 he joined Mr. Luce as business manager of Fortune and later was circulation director of Time, Life and Fortune. In 1939 he was made a vice president of Time Inc., and in 1941 became publisher of Time magazine. In 1949 he was named editor and publisher of Architectural Forum, a Time Inc. publication, and three years later oversaw the beginning of House and Home Magazine, a companion publication to Time.
        Mr. Prentice is survived by his wife, the former Janet McNair; two daughters, Barbara Kulish of Pendleton, S.C., and Carolyn Falise of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
