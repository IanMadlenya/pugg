        Walter J. Hornibrook, a research chemist who supervised the development of new products for E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company and the Stauffer Chemical Company, died on Tuesday at St. Luke's Hospital in Newburgh, N.Y. He was 74 years old and lived in New Windsor, N.Y.
        He died of prostatic and liver cancer, a family spokeswoman said.
        Dr. Hornibrook carried out research for du Pont for 20 years and was the manager of new product development at its Newburgh Research Laboratory from 1967 to 1972. He then managed planning and development at Stauffer's plastics division in Westport, Conn., until he retired in 1985.
        He was a native of Winnipeg, Manitoba, and earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Manitoba and a master's degree and a doctorate in chemistry from the University of Toronto. In World War II, he performed military research with private Canadian companies.
        Dr. Hornibrook received a Centennial Scholar award from Case Institute of Technology in 1980. He sang for many years with the Classical Oratorical Society in Washingtonville, N.Y., and with the choir of the Union Presbyterian Church in Balmville, N.Y.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Bernice Novak, and cousins in Vancouver and England.
