        Steve Wood, an Australian rowing champion who won the bronze medal at the Barcelona Olympics, died only weeks after beginning a comeback he had hoped would take him to next year's Atlanta Games. He was 34.
        The police gave no official cause of Wood's death, but said foul play was not suspected. Television reports late Friday said Wood had committed suicide Thursday but gave no further details.
        The police referred all inquiries to the Queensland Academy of Sport, where  Wood worked as a part-time coach, and to the Australian Institute of Sport canoeing unit.
        "No news spreads like bad news, and unfortunately this has hit everyone," said Barry Kelly, the Australian Institute of Sports national coach.
        Wood won a bronze medal in the K-4 1,000-meter final at the 1992 Olympics with Ramon Andersson, Kelvin Graham and Ian Rowlings.
        He is survived by his wife, Anna, and their 15-month-old son.
