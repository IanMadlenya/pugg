        Leonard Bocour, an artist and paint manufacturer involved in the vogue of acrylic painting that swept modern art in the 1960's, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 80.
        The cause was heart failure after a lengthy illness, his family said.
        Mr. Bocour, a native of Manhattan, started the Bocour Artist Colors paint factory in midtown in 1932 and operated it until he retired in 1986.
        At the time of the factory's founding, he was apprenticed to the European painter Emil Ganso. He had been grinding his own pigments, and Ganso advised him to sell his paints as well, which he did for a price artists could afford more readily than commercial products.
        Mr. Bocour kept in touch with artists and they often brought him their special requests. Thus, in the 1950's when painters tended toward large canvases, he began to market a king-size tube for them.
        In the 1940's, Mr. Bocour began experimenting with acrylic resins as a base for paint. Decades of work resulted in the lines of acrylic resin and polymer-based paints he introduced when the fast-drying synthetic paints became the rage with artists and the public.
        Over the years, He amassed a collection of more than 400 paintings. He also taught at the Brooklyn Museum Art School and the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine.
        Mr. Bocour is survived by his wife, Ruth; a son, Peter of Manhattan; two stepsons, Paul and Charles Hirsch, both of Los Angeles, and four grandchildren.
