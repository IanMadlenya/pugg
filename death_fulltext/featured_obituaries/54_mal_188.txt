        Bayard G. Schaeffer, a former vice president of Saks Fifth Avenue, died at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital on Tuesday. He was 64 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died after a long bout with Parkinson's disease, a spokesman for the family said.
        Mr. Schaeffer, a graduate of the Philadelphia Museum School and City College of New York, began his career with Alfred Dunhill and was later president of Cassegrain USA, leather importers. He was at Saks Fifth Avenue in the 1960's and 70's and became a vice president responsible for main-floor merchandise.
        Mr. Schaeffer, whose marriage to Marcia Meehan ended in divorce, is survived by a daughter, Georgina of Manhattan and Southampton, L.I., and a brother, John, of Manhattan.
