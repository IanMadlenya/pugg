        Fred W. Halstead, a longtime leader of the Socialist Workers Party and its candidate for President in 1968, died of liver cancer at his home in Los Angeles on Thursday. He was 61 years old.
        Mr. Halstead was active in the civil rights movement in the South in the 1950's and was later a prominent figure in protests against the Vietnam War, leading demonstrations and writing extensively on the subject.
        A native of Los Angeles, he attended the University of California at Los Angeles. In 1956, he moved to New York, where he became a garment cutter, a trade he pursued until his final illness. He also was a staff writer of The Militant, the publication of the Socialist Workers Party, the main Trotskyist group in the United States.
        Running as the party's candidate for President in 1968, he received about 41,000 votes.
        Mr. Halstead returned to Los Angeles in 1971 and continued as a leader in Socialist Workers activities.
        Mr. Halstead is survived by his wife, Virginia Garza ; two sons, Frank and Arthur of Los Angeles; and four daughters, Myrna Picorra of Mamaroneck, N.Y., Laura of Philadelphia and Celia and Leticia of Los Angeles.
