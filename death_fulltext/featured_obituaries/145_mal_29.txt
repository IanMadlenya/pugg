        Norman R. Glenn, the founder and publisher of two advertising and broadcasting magazines, died on Friday in New York City. He was 89.
        The cause was complications from a stroke, said his wife, Roberta.
        In the 1930's, Mr. Glenn held executive positions at WLS, a Chicago radio station. In 1946, he founded Sponsor magazine, which covered advertising on radio and television.
        After selling Sponsor, he started Media Decisions in 1966, a publication dealing with the planning and placement of advertisments in communications media. He sold that publication in 1984.
        A year later, he founded Community Action Network, a nonprofit group in New York City that provided information on urban problems.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Glenn is survived by two children from his first marriage, Robin Day Glenn of Rancho Santa Margarita, Calif., and Geoffrey, of Myrtle Beach, S.C.; two stepchildren, Robin Okun of Zurich and Todd Brewster of Dallas, and five grandchildren.
