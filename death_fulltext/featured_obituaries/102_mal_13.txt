        Lewis Hoyer Rabbage, a New York businessman who was a leading collector of American portrait miniatures, died on Tuesday at his sister's home in New Canaan, Conn.. He was 63.
        The cause was cancer, said Susan Strickler, curator of American art at the Worcester Art Museum in Massachusetts, to which Mr. Rabbage donated many works.
        A graduate of Williams College, Mr. Rabbage was the manager of needle sales at the Monarch Knitting Machine Corporation in Queens.
        He began collecting American portrait miniatures in 1980, specializing in those painted between the Civil War and World War II. Judging that the period had largely escaped the attention of scholars, he began compiling data on the artists and their subjects. He was soon recognized as an expert in the field, lecturing and writing numerous articles on the subject.
        His collection of 182 miniatures was exhibited at the Worcester museum in 1991. He later donated most of the pieces to the museum.
        He is survived by his sister, Ruth Kaupe.
