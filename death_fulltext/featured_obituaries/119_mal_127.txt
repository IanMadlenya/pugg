        Charles Deaton, an architect whose sculptural designs found expression in structures ranging from football stadiums to banks and private residences, died on Dec. 18 at Bear Creek Nursing Center in Morrison, Colo. He was 75.
        He died after a long illness, his family said.
        Mr. Deaton designed projects in 36 states and in Canada and Saudi Arabia, including Royals and Arrowhead stadiums in Kansas City, Mo., and the Wyoming National Bank in Casper.
        One of his most unusual structures was the house he designed for his family on Genesee Mountain, west of Denver. Widely known as the ''flying saucer house'' and resembling an open clamshell on a pedestal, it was featured in Woody Allen's 1973 comedy ''Sleeper.''
        Mr. Deaton, who was born in Clayton, N.M., was largely self-taught and worked as a commercial artist before gaining experience in aerodynamics and industrial design at a military plant during World War II.
        He is survived by three daughters, Claudia Deaton Glover of Chicago, Charlee Deaton of Golden, Colo., and Snow Deaton Schaefer of North glenn, Colo.; a sister, Serma Deaton Ray of Pueblo, Colo.; a half-brother, Harold Coffman of Lubbock, Tex., and seven grandchildren.
