        Warren V. Huber, a former head of neurology for the Veterans Administration, died on Monday at his home in San Francisco. He was 86 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, his family said.
        Dr. Huber worked for the agency for about 30 years and was its director of neurology for almost 20. He later worked for the National Institutes of Health and the American Neurological Association, where he was the director of the Joint Committee for Stroke Facilities.
        Dr. Huber was born in Brooklyn. After graduating from Columbia University in 1929, he earned his medical degree at the Long Island College of Medicine, now part of the State University of New York. He started a private practice in Brooklyn.
        During World War II and the Korean War, Dr. Huber was a neurologist in the Army, then joined the veterans agency.
        His wife of 55 years, the former Alice Roberts, died in 1989.
        He is survived by his second wife, the former Christine W. Schmitt; a son, Warren Huber Jr. of Santa Rosa, Calif.; a daughter, Ann Alton of Orinda, Calif.; two sisters, Winona Koch of Glen Rock, N.J., and Amanda Kochel of Lakewood N.J.; six grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
