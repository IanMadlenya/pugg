        Erich Fayer, a Canadian businessman who owned the French fashion house Pierre Balmain, has died, Reuters reported yesterday.
        The news service said a statement issued by Balmain in Paris did not indicate when or how Mr. Fayer had died. But a report in Women's Wear Daily yesterday said Mr. Fayer died on Tuesday in a hospital in Brussels. The fashion industry newspaper attributed the cause of death to a "weak heart that plagued him throughout his latter years."
        The reports of Mr. Fayer's death appeared on the day that fall clothing collections were being introduced in New York and could not be independently confirmed.
        In 1992 Mr. Fayer sought to infuse some excitement and youth into the fashion house, known for its elegant couture clothes, by hiring Oscar de la Renta to design its ready-to-wear and couture collections.
        In New York yesterday, members of Mr. de la Renta's staff expressed surprised at reports of Mr. Fayer's death.
        Mr. Fayer was often described as "fashion's mystery man" because little was known about him. He was rarely interviewed or photographed and his age, birthplace and nationality were the subjects of speculation. According to Women's Wear Daily, Mr. Fayer was said to have been born in Poland and to have escaped from there in World War II after losing several family members in Nazi concentration camps.
        Mr. Fayer's Montreal-based company, Produits Parfums et Cosmetiques Universels, acquired the House of Balmain in 1986. In 1990 he sold it to Alain Chevalier, a French financer and one of those behind the success of the Louis Vuitton group, only to buy it back a year later when the business faltered. In 1992 Mr. Fayer bought the Alfin company, a fragrance maker whose lines included Dilys by Laura Ashley and Adrien Arpel cosmetics.
        Mr. Fayer is survived by his wife, Elisabeth, who serves on the board of Alfin, and four sons.
