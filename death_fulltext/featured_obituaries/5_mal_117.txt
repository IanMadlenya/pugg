        Mr. Nix died of a heart attack at the Medical College of Pennsylvania, a hospital spokeswoman, Pat Baldridge, said.
        Mr. Nix was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1958, to fill an unexpired term, and served for more than 20 years until he lost in the 1978 Democratic primary to Representative William Gray 3d.
        While in Congress, he was the chairman of the Post Office and Civil Service Committee. He also was a ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.
        A Federal building now used by state appellate courts in Philadelphia bears Mr. Nix's name.
        He is survived by his son, Justice Robert N. C. Nix Jr., and four grandchildren.
