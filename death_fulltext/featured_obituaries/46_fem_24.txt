        Bettina Warburg Grimson, a retired psychiatrist, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90 years old.
        She died of pneumonia, a spokeswoman for the family said.
        Dr. Grimson, who used her maiden name in her work, was in private practice from 1932 until 1967, when she retired.
        From 1965 to 1967, she was a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. She taught at the center's Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic from 1932 to 1940.
        She graduated from Bryn Mawr College, the Cornell Medical School and the New York Psychoanalytic Institute.
        Her husband, Samuel B. Grimson, a musician, died in 1955. There are no immediate survivors.
