        Jack Warren Lowe, for more than 40 years the partner of Arthur Whittemore in  a popular duo-piano team, died on June 2 at his home in Boynton Beach, Fla. He was 79 and had suffered from emphysema.
        When the duo made their debut in 1940 at Town Hall in Manhattan, the reviews  were supportive but unexceptional. The New York Times critic Howard Taubman wrote that the pianists "may not burn up the world as a two-piano team, but they play pleasantly and with a well-considered and well-integrated balance of instruments."
        But the pianists quickly achieved success, thanks to their pleasing stage manner, breezy flair and innovative programming, which mixed classical and popular works. Over the next 15 years, their recordings sold more than one million copies. "Two Grand," an album recorded with the RCA Victor Orchestra and featuring their arrangements of pop hits like "In the Still of the Night," became a best seller. They continued to play classical repertory, notably the Poulenc Two-Piano Concerto with Dimitri Mitropoulos .
        Mr. Lowe was born in Aurora, Colo. He attended Colorado State Teachers College and earned a master's degree from the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, where he eventually taught. It was there that he met Mr. Whittemore.
        In 1942, both men enlisted in the Navy. During their four-year tour of duty,  they presented more than 700 concerts at bases and hospitals in the Pacific and  on radio broadcasts from the United States. After the war, they achieved success on radio and television, particularly on "Music in Silhouette," on WOR-TV in New York.
        In later years, they lived as neighbors in Quogue, L.I. Mr. Whittemore died in 1984. In retirement, Mr. Lowe taught music appreciation at the Boynton Beach  Public Library.
        No immediate family members survive.
