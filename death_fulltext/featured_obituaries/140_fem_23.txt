        Phyllis M. Rhinelander, a lineal descendant of two early mayors of New York City and of the Kip family, who gave their name to the Kips Bay region, died Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 77.
        A cousin, Adelaide Rhinelander Donaldson, said that death was the result of complications from pneumonia.
        Miss Rhinelander was a benefactor of several charities, including Save the Children and the restoration of the Bell Tower of the Church of the Holy Trinity. The Episcopal church, at East 88th Street and Second Avenue, was commissioned by her great-great-aunt, Serena Rhinelander, in 1895, and was built on property owned by the Rhinelander family. Among her ancestors were two early mayors of New York City, John Cruger (1739-44) and William Vermilye Brady (1847-48).
        Miss Rhinelander was born in Manhattan on May 19, 1921, the daughter of Helen G. and Philip Kip Rhinelander.
        A sister, Helen Rhinelander Schreuer of Dinard, France, survives.
