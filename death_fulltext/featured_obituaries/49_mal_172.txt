        David Herlihy, historian and professor of medieval history and former president of the American Historical Association, died Thursday at his home in Providence, R.I. He was 60 years old.
        He died of complications of pancreatic cancer, the family said.
        At the time of his death, Mr. Herlihy held an endowed professorship of history at Brown University and had just completed a book entitled "Women and Work in Medieval Europe."
        From 1973 through 1986 he was professor of medieval economic history at Harvard. He and Christiane Klapisch-Zuber, using computers to analyze medieval data, wrote the monumental work "Tuscans and Their Families," published by Yale University Press in 1984.
        "He was one of the first historians to write of women's roles in medieval history," said Mr. Herlihy's wife, Patricia Herlihy, an associate professor in the History Department at Brown.  The Medieval Family
        Born in San Francisco, he attended the University of San Francisco and earned a master's degree at Catholic University in Washington in 1953. He received a doctorate from Yale in 1956.
        His first teaching post was at Bryn Mawr from 1955 to 1964. He taught at the University of Wisconsin from 1964 to 1972, then a year at the Stanford Institute for Advanced Studies in the Behavioral Sciences.
        While at Harvard, he also published "The Social History of Italy and Western Europe" (1978) and "Cities and Societies in Medieval Italy" (1980). He also undertook a broad study of the medieval family, which resulted in the book "Medieval Households" (Harvard University Press, 1985).
        Besides his wife, he is survived by five sons: Christopher, David and Gregory of Boston, Felix of London and Maurice of Cambridge; a daughter, Irene of Somerville, Mass.; two sisters, Marie Schiebold and Irene Casserly, and a brother, Paul, all of San Francisco; and one grandson.
