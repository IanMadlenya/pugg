        Cozy Powell, a rock drummer known for his work with leading classic rock and heavy-metal groups, died on April 7 in Bristol, England. He was 50.
        The cause was a car crash, said a spokesman for Mr. Powell.
        A highly respected drummer who could be both subtle and brash, technically tight and stylistically free, Colin (Cozy) Powell spent three decades bobbing back and forth between his own bands and reincarnations of some of the most important British hard-rock bands of the 1970's. He  made his name playing with Jeff Beck in the early 70's. He formed his own band, Bedlam, and as a solo artist recorded a hit single in Britain, ''Dance With the Devil.''
        He played with Ritchie Blackmore's group Rainbow and the heavy-metal group Whitesnake. He also appeared on the Robert Plant album ''Pictures at 11'' in 1982.
        When the progressive rock group Emerson, Lake and Palmer made a comeback in the mid-80's, it was as Emerson, Lake and Powell. Mr. Powell spent the 90's playing with Black Sabbath, Brian May of Queen and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac. He also performed on the Jimi Hendrix tribute album ''In From the Storm.''
