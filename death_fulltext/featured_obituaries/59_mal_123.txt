        Mark Eichenberger, a polar mariner and sportsman who rowed a small boat from South America to Antarctica three years ago, was washed from the deck of a ship on Saturday and is presumed to have drowned.
        Mr. Eichenberger, 38 years old, was employed as first mate on the Erebus, a French-owned ice-breaking supply vessel. A spokesman of the National Science Foundation, which chartered the Erebus to carry supplies, scientists and support personnel to and from Palmer Station, Antarctica, said Mr. Eichenberger was washed overboard in a storm.
        The Erebus had arrived from Antarctica at Punta Arenas at the southern tip of Chile and had tied up at the dock when a storm struck. In an attempt to prevent damage to the ship, Mr. Eichenberger tried to cast off its mooring lines and leave the dock, but he is believed to have lost his footing in the high wind and mountainous waves and was washed overboard. His body has not been found.
        Mr. Eichenberger had just completed a rough trip northward across the Drake Passage with several scientists and some American diplomats and journalists who had been visiting Palmer Station.
        In 1988 Mr. Eichenberger and three companions -- Ned Gillette, Jay Morrison and Fred Trembly -- became the first men to row from South America to Antarctica, using a specially built aluminum rowboat to traverse the treacherous 600-mile Drake Passage. The passage is considered by mariners to be the roughest body of water in the world, and the group's boat, the "Sea Tomato," overturned several times before reaching King George Island off the Antarctic Peninsula.
        The son of American missionaries, Mr. Eichenberger spent most of his childhood in Peru and most of his adult life either at sea or in South America.
        Mr. Eichenberger is survived by his parents, Dr. and Mrs. Ralph Eichenberger of Huntington Beach, Calif.
