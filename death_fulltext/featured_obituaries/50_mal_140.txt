        David A. Karetsky, an investor and avid sportsman, was killed on Tuesday in an avalanche while on a helicopter skiing trip in the Purcell Mountains of British Columbia. He was 50 years old and lived in Aspen, Colo.
        He was the only American among the nine skiers who perished when an afternoon snow slide that began at 7,000 feet swept down a slope in the high-mountain area known as the Bugaboos. The accident occurred 125 miles west of the resort town of Banff, Alberta.
        In helicopter skiing, regarded as the most adventurous version of the sport, skiers are lifted to high altitudes to descend with a guide in virgin snow.
        Mr. Karetsky, a graduate of Yale and of the Columbia Law School, was head of the Davis Hill Corporation of Aspen, which invests in public and private ventures. In the late 1960's and early 1970's, he was with the New York investment firms of Lazard Freres and Goldman, Sachs & Co.
        At Yale he was on the varsity swimming team and represented the United States in the Maccabeean Games of 1961 in Israel, in which he won four gold and two silver medals. Later he competed in triathlons, in which participants swim, run and cycle long distances in sequence.
        Mr. Karetsky is survived by his wife, the former Gerri Kahn; two sons, Andrew and Robert, and a daughter, Jennifer, all of Aspen; his parents, Sara and John, of West Palm Beach, Fla., and two brothers, Samuel, of Katonah, N.Y., and Alfred, of Scarsdale, N.Y.
