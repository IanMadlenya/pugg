        Meir Gruenburg, a rabbi, scholar and dean who was credited with helping save more than 2,000 Jews from the Nazis, died on Wednesday while on vacation in Fleischmanns, N.Y. He was 83 and lived in Brooklyn.
        The cause was a heart attack, a family spokesman said.
        Rabbi Gruenburg was known for his discourses on the Torah and Talmudic law, and he ordained many rabbis.
        Since 1977, he led the Poale Agudath Israel congregation in Brooklyn. He had served 28 years as the rabbi at the Young Israel of University Heights in the Bronx and as the dean of the Rabbeinu Chaim Yosef Rabbinical Seminary in Brooklyn.
        He was a leader of the Rabbinical Alliance of America, an organization of 500 Orthodox rabbis and deans. He served as associate chief justice of its Rabbinical Court, which decides divorces, business disputes and other cases covered by religious law. He was also a member of the executive board of the Union of Orthodox Rabbis of America and Canada.
        Born in Hungary, Rabbi Gruenburg grew up in Kayzmark, Czechoslovakia, where he succeeded his father and grandfather as the chief rabbi. Before the war he was the chief rabbi in Lipto Svati Mikolosh, near the Polish border.
        He helped to save more than 2,000 Jews, most of them were from the Galitzia section of Poland, by finding slave-labor jobs for many of them in the local leather tanneries in Mikolosh and by concealing others in secret bunkers at his home and at the synagogue. From the fall of 1944 to the spring of 1945, when the Nazis were defeated, he and some 3,000 others escaped the ravages of persecution and war by hiding in the Moshnitzer Woods.
        He was married for 57 years to the former Sara Ginsburg, whose father was the chief rabbi of Oronosh-Medesz, Hungary; a son, Rabbi Chaim Zvi, of Brooklyn; a daughter, Rivke Rimpler, of Brooklyn, whose husband is a rabbi; 13 grandchildren, and 22 great-grandchildren.
