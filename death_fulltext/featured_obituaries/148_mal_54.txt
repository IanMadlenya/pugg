        Gilbert Millstein, who wrote an early review of Jack Kerouac's novel ''On the Road'' that helped establish the fame of both Kerouac and the Beat Generation, died on Friday at Tisch Hospital of New York University Medical Center. He was 83 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was kidney failure, said his wife, Barbara Head.
        Mr. Millstein was also the news editor of the ''NBC Nightly News'' for a decade beginning in the mid-1970's.
        Mr. Millstein's 1957 review of ''On the Road'' in The New York Times described the novel as ''an authentic work of art, the most beautifully executed, the clearest and the most important utterance yet made by the generation Kerouac himself named years ago as 'beat,' and whose principal avatar he is.''
        In 1986 The Los Angeles Times said Mr. Millstein was still remembered as the critic who ''propelled both Kerouac and his Beat Generation beatitudes from limbo to limelight.''
        Mr. Millstein worked for the Sunday department of The New York Times from 1949 to 1963, writing book reviews and articles on a variety of topics; he continued to do so after leaving its staff. His other work included articles for magazines like The Saturday Evening Post, two novels and the text for ''New York: True North'' (1964), a book of photographs by Sam Falk, a photographer for The Times.
        Mr. Millstein was born and reared in the Bronx and graduated from City College.
        He worked as a writer for newspapers in Philadelphia and New York and for Time Inc. before joining The Times.
        His marriages to Ruth Moret and Patricia Kip ended in divorce.
        Besides his wife he is survived by three sons, Ezra, of Manhattan; Joshua, of East Hampton, N.Y., and Jonathan, of Brooklyn; a stepdaughter, Tamar Losee of Queens; five grandchildren, and a brother, Ezra, who lives near Los Angeles.
