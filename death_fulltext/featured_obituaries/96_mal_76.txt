        Edward T. Gargan, a scholar of modern French intellectual and social history and emeritus professor of French history at the University of Wisconsin, died on Tuesday at his home in Madison. He was 72.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Professor Gargan was the author or editor of seven books and many articles and book reviews in academic journals. He was a former president of the Society for French Historical Studies and of the American Catholic Historical Association.
        Born to Irish immigrants in Brooklyn, he received a bachelor's degree from Brooklyn College and a doctorate in European history from Catholic University of America.
        He taught at Boston College, Loyola University of Chicago and then at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., where he served as chairman of the history department. He joined the faculty of the University of Wisconsin at Madison in 1967 and taught there until his retirement in 1992.
        Professor Gargan is survived by his wife, Bernadette A. Gargan; and two sons, Christopher B., of Mount Horeb, Wis., and Edward A., a foreign correspondent for The New York Times.
