        William Heyward Homer Turner, former executive director of the United States Steel Corporation's foundation and an early developer of corporate philanthropy, died on Oct. 30 at St. Joseph Medical Center in Stamford, Conn. He was 93 and a resident of Stamford.
        Mr. Turner joined the United States Steel Corporation in 1938 as assistant to the vice president and controller and became executive director of the foundation when it was created in 1953. In that position, he made recommendations on the allocation of available funds and developed a philanthropy program that was widely copied.
        Mr. Turner also helped found two units of the Conference Board, a business research group: the Council of Corporate Executives on Contributions, and the Public Affairs Research Council.
        After retiring from United States Steel in 1969, Mr. Turner was director of studies in philanthropy and liberal education for the Academy for Educational Development and, from 1971 to 1978, was executive vice president for the National Council on Philanthropy in New York.
        Mr. Turner's first marriage, in 1929, to the late Clara Andres, ended in divorce in 1964. He was remarried the following year to Veda Brock.
        He is survived by his wife and two sons, Roger J.A. Turner of Falls Church, Va., and William Heyward Turner of Greenwich, five grandchildren and two great grandchildren.
