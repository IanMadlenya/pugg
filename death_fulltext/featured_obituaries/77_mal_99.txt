        Sidney Kaplan, a leading scholar of black culture and history in America and an analyst of how blacks are portrayed, died Tuesday at a hospital in his hometown, Northampton, Mass. He was 80.
        The cause was heart disease, his family said.
        In 1963, Dr. Kaplan and an art gallery organized a seminal exhibit on portrayals of blacks in American painting. His latest work was as a consultant for the Public Broadcasting System series "The Civil War" and its forthcoming "Africans in America."
        His books included "The Black Presence in the Era of the American Revolution" (New York Graphic Society, 1973), written with his wife, Emma, and "American Studies in Black and White" (University of Massachusetts, 1991). Founder of Department
        For 31 years he taught at the University of Massachusetts, mostly at the Amherst campus, and helped found its African-American Studies Department. He also helped create the University of Massachusetts Press; was a founder and the editor of The Massachusetts Review, a journal on the arts and public affairs, and edited the Gehenna Press, a journal on the fine arts.
        Dr. Kaplan was born in Queens and graduated from City College.
        In World War II he served as a first lieutenant in the United States Army in England. His experiences working with an all-black unit in the segregated Army, coupled with his interest in Marxism, led to his later career.
        After the war, he resumed his studies, earning a master's degree in history at Boston University and a doctorate in American civilization at Harvard University.
        He was a Fulbright lecturer in Greece and Yugoslavia and an exchange professor at the University of Kent in England. He retired from teaching in 1978.
        He is survived by his wife of 60 years, the former Emma Nogrady; a daughter, Cora Kaplan of Hoboken, N.J.; a son, Paul of Dobbs Ferry, N.Y.; a sister, Claire Gerner of Toronto, and two grandchildren.
