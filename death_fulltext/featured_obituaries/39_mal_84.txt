        R. Dixon Herman, the Federal judge who oversaw the conspiracy trial of the Harrisburg Seven, died of a heart attack on Friday at Harrisburg Hospital. He was 78 years old.
        Judge Herman was appointed to the Federal District Court in 1969 by President Richard M. Nixon. He became a senior judge in 1981.
        In 1972 he presided at the trial of seven Vietnam War opponents: the Rev. Phillip Berrigan, two other priests, a former priest, two nuns and a Pakistani scholar. The principal charges were conspiring to blow up underground steam tunnels in Washington and kidnap Henry A. Kissinger in an effort to end the war. The jury could not agree on the major charges, convicting Father Berrigan and a co-defendant, Sister Elizabeth McAlister, only of smuggling letters into the Federal prson in Lewisiburg, Pa.
        Judge Herman, a graduate of Bucknell University and the Cornell Law School, was a state judge before he was named a Federal judge.
        Survivors include his wife, the former Elizabeth Dunn DeWitt, a son and three daughters.
