        T. Harris Jackson, a retired Associated Press editor who shaped the news agency's foreign report for 33 years, died on Monday at New York Hospital. He was 74 and lived in Ocean Bay Park on Fire Island, L.I.
        The causes were complications from lung cancer and emphysema, his family said.
        Mr. Jackson was the overnight editor of the foreign desk at The Associated Press, the world's largest news service, from 1950 until shortly before retiring in 1983. He guided the agency's world report that served afternoon papers when they were the dominant newspaper voice in the United States.
        He was born in Baton Rouge, La., and graduated from Louisiana State University. He was a reporter for The Baton Rouge State Times and Morning Advocate before joining The Associated Press in New Orleans in 1940.
        In World War II he served as a lieutenant commander in the Navy, participating in the invasions of Sicily, Anzio and France.
        His survivors include a sister, Bettye Wood of Baton Rouge.
