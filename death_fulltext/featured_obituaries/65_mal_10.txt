        Julien J. Soubiran, the chairman and a co-founder of the Horan Engraving Company in Manhattan, died yesterday at his home in Darien, Conn. He was 93 years old.
        He died after a long illness, his family said.
        Mr. Soubiran, who helped start the company in 1928, was the author of "The Art and Technique of Photoengraving" and produced a number of training films showing the company's plant.
        He is survived by his daughter, Therese S. Maguire of Rye, N.Y., four grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
