        Dr. James A. Prevost, a former New York State Commissioner of Mental Health, died on Monday at Grant Hospital in Chicago. He was 58 and lived in Chicago.
        The cause was prostate cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Prevost gained a reputation as an outstanding administrator at the Richard H. Hutchins Psychiatric Center in Syracuse, his native city. He served as its director from 1970 to 1977 while he also was on the faculty of the psychiatry department, State University College of Medicine at Syracuse. He had received his M.D. there in 1960.
        In 1977, Gov. Hugh L. Carey appointed Dr. Prevost acting Commissioner of Mental Health. He became Commissioner the following April and served through Mr. Carey's second and last term, to the end of 1982.
        Most recently, Dr. Prevost was the director of research for the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations, based in Oak Brook, Ill., which joined several earlier accrediting bodies. He held the position from 1985 until last summer.
        Dr. Prevost is survived by his wife, Gloria; two sons, James F. of Cincinnati, and Michael A. of Albany; a daughter, Julie A. Prevost, also of Albany; a brother, the Rev. Frederick Prevost; two sisters, Mary Mulhauser of Paramus, N.J., and Jennie Williams of Fayetteville, N.Y., and two grandchildren.
