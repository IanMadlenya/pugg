        Dr. Leon Roizin, a researcher in the field of drugs that affect the mind and the central nervous system, died on Wednesday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 78 years old and lived in the Riverdale section of the Bronx.
        He died of heart failure, his family said.
        Dr. Roizin was director of the Department of Neuropathology and Neurotoxicology at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, a division of Columbia-Presbyterian, from 1965 to 1987, when he retired. He was also a professor emeritus at the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia.
        Dr. Roizin was born in Dubossary, Russia, and received his doctoral degree from the Universiiy of Milan. He joined the Psychiatric Institute in 1940.
        His research into the possible adverse and toxic effects of psychotropic and mind-altering drugs led to the establishment in 1965 of the Neurotoxicology Service and Research Unit at the institute, which became the largest laboratory of its kind in the United States. He continued to work in the laboratory until his death.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Evelyn Iannone; two daughters, Dr. Laurie Towle of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., and Diane Garvey of McLean, Va., and three grandchildren.
