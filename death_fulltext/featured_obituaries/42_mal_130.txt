        Joseph R. Corso, a retired New York State Supreme Court Justice and a former State Assemblyman, died on Monday at Tisch Hospital of New York University. He was 81 years old and lived in Mattituck, L.I.
        His family said the cause of death was heart disease.
        Justice Corso, who was elected to the Supreme Court in Brooklyn in 1968, presided over several important trials, including the Son of Sam murder case in 1978. Two years later he was reassigned to the court in Suffolk County, where he served until 1986.
        In the Son of Sam case, David R. Berkowitz, a 25-year-old former postal clerk, was sentenced to six terms of 25 years to life for murdering six people in nighttime forays over a year's time. Justice Corso accepted the defendant's guilty plea and meted out the sentence for the murder of Stacy Moskowitz, the killer's last victim. The five other sentences were pronounced by justices from Queens and the Bronx, where those murders took place.
        Codes Committee Chairman
        Justice Corso, a Democrat, served in the Assembly from 1949 to 1966, including two terms as chairman of the Codes Committee. He was a member of the Joint Legislative Commission to revise the New York State Penal Law, now known as the Criminal Procedure Law.
        He was born in Brooklyn and was a graduate of Fordham and of its law school. He was in private practice from 1931 until he was elected to the Civil Court in 1966.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Camilla Falbo, whom he married in 1937; two daughters, Mary Miller of Smithtown, L.I., and Joanne, of Northport, L.I., and six grandchildren.
