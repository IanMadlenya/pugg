        Howard J. Cerny, a New York City lawyer who was an unindicted co-conspirator and a Government witness in the 1974 criminal trial of two former members of President Richard M. Nixon's Cabinet, died on Sept. 18 at his home in Manhattan. He was 68.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his son James, of Forest Hills, Queens.
        Mr. Cerny was a lawyer for Robert L. Vesco, the fugitive financier. The two Cabinet members were former Attorney General John N. Mitchell, who directed the 1972 Nixon re-election campaign, and former Commerce Secretary Maurice H. Stans, who was the campaign's chief fund-raiser.
        The two were acquitted on charges of obstructing a Federal investigation of Mr. Vesco in return for a $200,000 campaign contribution.
        Mr. Cerny was a native of Iowa and a 1948 graduate of the University of Iowa's law school. He moved to New York, where he was chief counsel to the State Joint Legislative Committee investigating illegal eavesdropping. In 1965 he was named Chief Assistant District Attorney in Queens.
        He was a trustee of the Charles Hayden Foundation, American University and the Center for the Study of the Presidency. In 1985 he was chairman of the New York Statue of Liberty Celebration.
        Mr. Cerny was divorced from Elizabeth Cerny of Jamaica Estates, Queens. In addition to his son James, he is survived by two other sons, Stephen, of Kew Gardens, Queens, and Kenneth, of Birmingham, Ala.; a brother, Leonard, and three sisters, Dolores Walbrun, Nadine Tisl and Shirley Tschantz.
