        Sam O'Steen, a film editor whose work brought him three Academy Award nominations, died on Wednesday in Atlantic City. He was 76 and lived in New York.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his daughter Kathleen.
        Mr. O'Steen became fascinated with filmmaking as a boy growing up in Burbank, Calif., and would regularly wangle his way onto the Warner Brothers lot in hopes of getting his foot in the door of an editing room.
        His first film was ''The Wrong Man'' (1957), directed by Alfred Hitchcock, on which he was an assistant editor. He wasn't credited as a full-fledged editor until 1964, when he worked on ''Robin and the Seven Hoods'' and ''Youngblood Hawke.''
        In addition to Hitchcock, Mr.  O'Steen worked with a number of other directors, including Alan J. Pakula and Roman Polanski. He edited both ''Rosemary's Baby'' and ''Chinatown'' for Mr. Polanski and received an Oscar nomination for ''Chinatown.'' He received a second nomination for his work on Mike Nichols's ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' and a third for another Nichols film, ''Silkwood.'' In all, he edited nine of Mr. Nichols's films, including ''The Graduate,'' ''Catch-22'' and ''Carnal Knowledge.''
        Mr. O'Steen made his debut as a film director in 1976 with ''Sparkle.'' His television credits included ''Queen of the Stardust Ballroom,'' which he also directed and for which he received an Emmy nomination.
        In addition to his daughter Kathleen, he is survived by his wife, Bobbie, and three other daughters, Molly, Danielle and Wendy.
