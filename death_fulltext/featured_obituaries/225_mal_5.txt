        Sam Goldaper, a retired reporter for The New York Times who covered sports for New York newspapers for nearly half a century, died Saturday at North Shore University Hospital at Plainview on Long Island. Mr. Goldaper, whose home was in Bayside, Queens, was 83.
        The cause was complications of a stroke, his son, Robert, said.
        Mr. Goldaper joined The Times in 1967, covering high school sports. He later focused on pro basketball and college basketball, writing on the Knicks for many years.
        Mr. Goldaper, a native of Brooklyn, attended Brooklyn College, then covered sports for The Brooklyn Eagle, The New York Herald Tribune and The World Journal Tribune before joining The Times. He retired in 1992.
        In addition to Robert Goldaper, of Kings Park, N.Y., he is survived by his wife, Martha; a daughter, Brenda Dickerman, of North Bellmore, N.Y.; a sister, Toby Cash, of the Bronx; and two grandchildren.
