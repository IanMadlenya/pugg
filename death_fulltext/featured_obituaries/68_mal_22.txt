        Joshua Morrison, a retired New York businessman with many charitable interests, died on Wednesday at his home in Larchmont, N.Y. He was 91 years old.
        His family said he died of heart failure.
        Mr. Morrison was born in Ukraine and was brought to this country as a child. He graduated in 1921 from Clark University in Worcester, Mass., of which he was a trustee emeritus. He earned a law degree at Harvard University and went into investment banking.
        In 1934, he went to Israel to work for the Palestine Economic Corporation for a year. Most of his later business activities had an Israeli connection.
        Returning to New York, Mr. Morrison practiced law until the outbreak of war, when he served as an officer in the Navy. He then helped organize the American-Israeli Shipping Company, which supplied Israel during the 1948 war. He also represented the Israel Discount Bank Ltd. Tel Aviv until it opened a New York branch in 1962 and he became its president.
        He was the founding president of Overseas Shipholding Group Inc., formed in 1969.
        Mr. Morrison was long active on behalf of the Palestine Endowment Fund, the United States Committee for the Israel Endowment and the Westchester Jewish Community Services.
        He is survived by his wife of nearly 58 years, the former Estelle Butler; a son, Alan, of Washington; a daughter, Peggy Morrison Horan of Big Sur, Calif.; a sister, Myrtle Sharpe of Bethesda, Md., and four granddaughters.
