        Louis V. Fugazy, a retired vice chairman of Fugazy International, parent organization of the travel, limousine and parking companies, died on Sunday at New Rochelle Hospital in New York. He was 76.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        The business was founded in 1870 by his grandfather and namesake, Louis V. Fugazy, as the Fugazy Steamship Company.
        A native of Greenwich Village, Mr. Fugazy attended Columbia University before joining what was then called the Fugazy Travel Bureau. In World War II, he enlisted in the Navy and served in the Pacific. A lifelong boxing enthusiast, he was the 1935 flyweight New York City Golden Gloves champion as well as a Navy champion later.
        After the war, he rejoined the family enterprise and with his younger brother William Denis built it into an international travel business. After retirement from Fugazy International in 1980, he founded Louis Fugazy Associates, a travel and public-relations firm he ran until three years ago.
        Mr. Fugazy was active in the resettlement of Jewish refugees before World War II. In 1978 he founded the Wine and Roses Celebrity Golf Tournament, with proceeds going to fight alcohol and drug abuse among young people.
        For promoting Italian tourism, the Rome Government made him a Commander of the Order of St. George in 1951.
        In addition to his brother, a resident of Harrison, N.Y., Mr. Fugazy is survived by his wife of 46 years, Doris; three sons, Louis V., of Glen Cove, L.I., Christopher M., of City Island, N.Y., and Steven, of Pelham, N.Y.; three daughters, Milena DelTorto of Mount Vernon, N.Y., Susan Behrendt of Northport, L.I.; and Doris Fugazy of Manhattan; a sister, Sister Irene Fugazy of Ardsley, N.Y., and nine grandchildren.
