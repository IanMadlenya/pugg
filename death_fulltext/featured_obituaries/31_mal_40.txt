        Bishop Charles R. Mulrooney, who was the Auxiliary Bishop in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn for 22 years until his retirement in 1981, died Saturday at the Queen of Peace Residence in Queens Village, Queens. He was 83 years old and was a resident of the church home for the aged.
        A native of Brooklyn, Bishop Mulrooney attended Cathedral College of the Immaculate Conception, the Brooklyn diocesan preparatory seminary. He taught at the college from 1932 until 1952 and was its rector from then until Pope John XXIII appointed him an Auxiliary in Brooklyn to assist Bishop Bryan J. McEntegart, who consecrated him in 1959.
        After his ordination in 1930, Bishop Mulrooney was a parish priest in Brooklyn and Queens until his transfer to Cathedral College. The seminary, which later moved to Douglaston, Queens, graduated its last class in June and is now the site of the Immaculate Conception Center.
        Between 1959 and 1972, Bishop Mulrooney also served as pastor of St. Jerome's parish in Flatbush. Until recently, he continued to take on various duties in the Diocese for Brooklyn and Queens, although he officially retired as Auxiliary Bishop at the age of 75.
        He is survived by a sister, Kathleen McDermott, of Bethlehem, Conn.
        A funeral mass will be celebrated by Bishop Francis J. Mugavero at the new center, at 7200 Douglaston Parkway, at 11 A.M. on Wednesday.
