        Ezra Ehrenkrantz, a versatile architect, died on Sept. 22 at his home in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. He was 69.
        He had cancer, his firm said in announcing his death.
        When he died, he was a partner in Ehrenkrantz Eckstut & Kuhn Architects, at 23 East Fourth Street in Manhattan. Ill health had curtailed his work in recent years.
        At his death, he was also the executive director of the New Jersey Institute of Technology's Center for Architecture and Building Science Research. He also taught at the institute.
        In 1993, he was awarded the Medal of Honor of the American Institute of Architects' New York chapter. In 1990, he received the President's Award of the National Institute of Building Sciences.
        He designed housing; educational, health, laboratory and commercial buildings; and other structures. His work included developing building systems that could be revised easily to accommodate technological innovation and organizational change.
        Among the projects he was involved in were master plans for New York City Technical College in Brooklyn; Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, N.J.; and facilities renewal at Columbia.
        He was an architect for four decades. From 1966 to 1968 he was on the White House Task Force on the City. In 1991 he won the Presidential Design Award from a Department of Veterans Affairs' hospital unit.
        Born in Newark, he held a bachelor's degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a master's degree from the University of Liverpool, both in architecture.
        Surviving are his wife, Cynthia; a daughter, Ruth Ehrenkrantz; two sons, Dan and Jonathan; and four grandchildren.
