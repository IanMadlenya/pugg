        Robert P. Mauthner, the diplomatic editor of The Financial Times, died yesterday in London. He was 65.
        The cause was cancer, the newspaper said without providing further details.
        Mr. Mauthner joined The Financial Times in 1968 and served as its Paris bureau chief from 1971 to 1981. He then returned to London to become the newspaper's foreign news editor and then diplomatic editor, a post from which he wrote columns about international affairs.
        He was born in Amsterdam and was a graduate of Oxford.
        He is survived by his wife, Anne Mauthner, of London.
