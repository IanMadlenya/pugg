        Walter J. Skower, who was the police chief of Enfield, Conn., for 32 years and one of the longest serving chiefs in the state, died on Friday at St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center in Hartford. He was 72 years old and lived in Enfield.
        He died of a circulatory ailment, a family spokesman said.
        His tenure as chief ranked as the longest since the state started keeping records 58 years ago, said James Smeallie, associate director of the Connecticut Police Chiefs' Association. Mr. Skower joined the town department as an auxiliary officer in 1948 and became its chief 10 years later. He retired two years ago.
        During his administration, he founded Enfield's free ambulance service, which is operated by police officers with medical training.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Helen Kret; two daughters, Linda Boula of Enfield and Karen Kelley of Windsor, Conn.; a sister, Stacia Foley of Enfield, and three grandchildren.
