        Rea Hopper, a former associate of the industrialist Howard R. Hughes who was the chief designer of the Spruce Goose, a huge plywood flying boat, died on Friday at the Berkeley East nursing home in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 85 years old and lived in Los Angeles.
        He died of pneumonia after a stroke, his family said.
        Mr. Hopper, a graduate of the California Institute of Technology, joined the Hughes Aircraft Company in 1939 as chief designer. The Spruce Goose, built by Mr. Hughes and Henry Kaiser for the United States Government in World War II, was 50 percent larger than a Boeing 747 and was made of birch plywood. It was intended to carry cargo and troops across the Atlantic.
        The Government lost interest in the craft after the war but in 1947 Mr. Hughes piloted it on its only flight, spanning several hundred yards in Long Beach harbor, with Mr. Hopper at his shoulder giving directions.
        Mr. Hopper remained close to the industrialist, becoming a senior vice president of the Summa Corporation, the holding company for most of the Hughes interests after the sale of the Hughes Tool Company.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Mary Patchin; two daughters, Polly and Paige; two sons, Christopher and Randolph; two sisters, Esther Hopper of Riverside, Calif., and Evelyn Cozzolino of Santa Barbara, and four grandchildren.
