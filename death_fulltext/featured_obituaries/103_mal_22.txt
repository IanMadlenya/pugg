        Ralph H. Smith, who gave new voice to an old calling by ringing his bell and crying "Hear, ye, hear, ye," died on Monday at a hospital in Cincinnati, leaving the suburban village of Mariemont without a town crier for the first time since 1961. He was 80.
        Mr. Smith, a lawyer in Cincinnati until he retired in 1981, was believed to be the only elected town crier in the United States.
        In an age of instant electronic news and a reliable local telephone gossip exchange, he knew there was not all that much to cry out about on the streets of Mariemont. Indeed, his official duties were limited to opening and closing the annual town meeting and leading the Memorial Day parade.
        "He loved being town crier," a daughter, Eleanor Wilke, said yesterday, recalling that her father broke into the crying business when the Mayor of Mariemont, asked him to fill in when the town crier got sick. After the man died, Mr. Smith was elected to the unpaid position.
        Besides Mrs. Wilke of Cincinnati, Mr. Smith is survived by his wife, Mary Eleanor Smith; another daughter, Ann Veddern of Mason, Ohio, and three grandchildren.
