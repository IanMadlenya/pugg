        Dr. Henry Brill, an authority on drug addiction who was director of the Pilgrim State Psychiatric Center in West Brentwood, L.I., from 1958 to 1974, died yesterday at Good Samaritan Hospital in West Islip, L.I.
        Dr. Brill, who was 83 years old and lived in Islip, died of cancer, a family spokesman said.
        A psychiatrist and educator, Dr. Brill helped introduce the use of tranquilizers in New York State mental hospitals to foster the early release of patients. He was successively the first deputy commissioner of the state's Department of Mental Hygiene, its regional commissioner for Long Island and later a consultant.
        Dr. Brill had lectured at the State University Medical Center at Syracuse and the Columbia University Medical School, and he was a clinical professor at the Downstate Medical Center in Stonybrook, L.I. He was for decades a consultant on drug abuse to many state and Federal agencies, the American Medical Association, the National Academy of Sciences and the World Health Organization.
        His many posts included chairman of the state's Drug Abuse Advisory Commission and president of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology. He repeatedly warned of the hazards of marijuana and opposed its legalization.
        Dr. Brill, a tall, energetic man, was a native of Bridgeport, Conn., who earned both bachelor and medical degrees at Yale. He interned at Pilgrim State, the largest mental institution in New York, and was its clinical director for eight years before rising to director.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Wenonah Beale; a son, Michael, of Alexandria, Va.; two daughters, Helen Broxmeyer of McLean, Va., and Jean Hough of Morrisville, Pa., and four grandchildren.
