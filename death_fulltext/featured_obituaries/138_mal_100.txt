        Raymond D. Gerwe, a chemist and developer of two United States patents, died July 12 of congestive heart failure. He was 94 and lived in Lakeland, Fla.
        Mr. Gerwe was born in Cincinnati on May 28, 1904. He received a bachelor's degree in chemistry and mathematics from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, in 1927 and a doctorate in organic chemistry from the University of Cincinnati in 1932.
        From 1932 to 1938, he was in charge of research and development for the Kroger Company in Cincinnati, where he helped develop formulas for bottled soft drinks, gelatin and mayonnaise, as well as writing Kroger's quality control standards.
        In 1938, he became director of research for the Florida division of the Food Machinery Corporation, the forerunner of the FMC Corporation, in Dunedin. In 1947, the office moved to Lakeland.
        In 1950, in conjunction with American Cyanamid, he helped develop FD&C Red No. 2, a color used on oranges.
        Mr. Gerwe developed two patents on coating preparations used to prolong the freshness of fruits and vegetables and was instrumental in proving that limonene, an extract from citrus, was beneficial. L-carvone, one of seven compounds found in limonene, is one of the principal ingredients in the oil of spearmint.
        He retired from FMC in 1970. He served as a consultant for citrus processing companies until 1995.
        Mr. Gerwe is survived by a daughter, Carole Gerwe Cox of Dunwoody, Ga.; a son, Roderick D. Gerwe of Kingsport, Tenn.; a sister, Marie Jonas of Indianapolis, and six grandchildren. Mr. Gerwe's wife, Florence (Sally) Cary Gerwe, died in 1994.
