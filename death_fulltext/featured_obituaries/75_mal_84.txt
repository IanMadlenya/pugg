        Correction:  May 1, 1993, Saturday
        An obituary on April 20 about Gottlieb Hammer, a financial consultant and active supporter of Israel who died on April 19 at the Miami Heart Institute in Florida, misstated his age, the cause of death and the identities of some survivors. A corrected version appears today on page 31.
