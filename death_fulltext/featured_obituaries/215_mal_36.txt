        George S. Rattner, a paint manufacturer and an Off Broadway playwright, died on Wednesday at North Shore Community Hospital in Great Neck, N.Y. He was 82.
        The cause was pulmonary fibrosis, his family said.
        For nearly 40 years, Mr. Rattner was head of Paragon Paint and Varnish Corporation of Long Island City, Queens.
        He also wrote nine plays produced at Off Broadway theaters in New York and elsewhere. These included ''The Last Sortie,'' ''Of Blessed Memory'' and ''Tender Offer.''
        Mr. Rattner was born on Jan. 24, 1922, in New York City and graduated from James Madison High School and Pennsylvania State University. He received an M.A. from Brown University in creative writing. During World War II he was a navigator on a B-17 and received the Distinguished Flying Cross.
        His survivors include two sons, Steven, of New York, and Donald, of Brooklyn; a daughter, Susan, of Great Falls, Va., and seven grandchildren.
