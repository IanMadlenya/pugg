        Hyman Korn, a retired justice of New York State Supreme Court, died on Sunday at the Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 88 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of complications of a stroke, a family spokesman said.
        Justice Korn, who served in the courts for 30 years, joined the State Supreme Court in 1962, when the Bronx County Court in which he was serving was consolidated into the state system. He retired in 1979. First Served as Magistrate
        He was first appointed a city magistrate in 1949 by Mayor William O'Dwyer. He had been in private practice since 1925, when he graduated from Brooklyn Law School, and was serving as secretary to Charles A. Buckley, a Democratic leader in the Bronx and a member of the House of Representatives.
        In 1957 Magistrate Korn was appointed a City Court justice by Gov. Averell Harriman, and he served there until 1960, when he moved to the County Court.
        Justice Korn, who was born in New York City on June 30, 1902, handled several significant cases over the years. In 1971 he was involved in upholding Knapp Commission subpoenas in the commission's investigation of corruption in the New York City Police Department.
        Noted as a compassionate judge, he delayed the sentencing of a young man who had been arrested at a peace rally in 1950 on a disorderly-conduct charge. Magistrate Korn found out that the defendant was about to be married.
        In 1977 Justice Korn worked out an agreement with General Motors to replace cars sold by Buick, Oldsmobile and Pontiac dealers to about 5,000 people. They had not been informed that the auto maker switched engines in the vehicles for ones made by its Chevrolet division.
        Justice Korn is survived by his wife, Beatrice, and a sister, Anna Willner of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
