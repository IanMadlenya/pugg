        Mr. Odell was an award-winning architect whose contribution to Southern architecture was design creativity rather than imitation. After graduation from Cornell University in 1935 and graduate studies at L'Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, he apprenticed in New York City with Harrison & Fouilhoux, architects of Rockefeller Center.
        He was elected a Fellow in the American Institute of Architects in 1955, and in 1965 he became the first Southerner to head the national organization. In 1966 he was recognized for his achievements by his home state, receiving the North Carolina Award. Among his internationally recognized buildings are the Burlington Industries Corporation headquarters in Greensboro, N.C.; the North Carolina Blue Cross and Blue Shield Building in Chapel Hill, NC; and the Hampton Coliseum in Hampton, Va. His firm has won more than 75 design awards.
        In the mid-1960's, Mr. Odell was in charge of the United States Department of the Interior's Potomac Planning Task Force to develop a plan for the Potomac River basin.
        Mr. Odell, who retired as chairman of Odell Associates in 1982, is survived by his wife, Mary Walker Odell, of Charlotte; three children, William Robinson Odell, of Charlotte, Alexandra Odell Dalbeck, of Edgemoor, S.C., and Charles Alexander Odell, of Charlotte; a brother, John K. P. Odell, of Concord, N.C.; and four grandchildren.
