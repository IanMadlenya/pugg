        Donald Frederick Poulson, a senior research biologist and a professor emeritus of biology at Yale University, died on Thursday at Yale-New Haven Hospital from injuries suffered on Nov. 29 in an automobile accident in New Haven. He was 79 years old.
        While an undergraduate at the California Institute of Technology, Professor Poulson began the first detailed analysis of embryonic development in the fruit fly and how certain genes interfered with it. After earning a doctorate from the institute, he joined the Yale faculty in 1937. In 1962, when the botany and zoology departments were merged into the biology department, he was its first chairman.
        Professor Poulson was twice a Fulbright research scholar. In 1957, the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation awarded him a fellowship, and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science gave him another, in 1979.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Margaret Boardman; two sons, Donald, of Norwich, Vt., and Christian 2d, of Cambridge, N.Y.; a sister, Mary P. Gibson of Rexburg, Idaho, and three grandchildren.
