        Joel Martin Solomon, former chief executive officer of the American Association of Blood Banks, died on Wednesday at the Shady Grove Nursing Center  in Shady Grove, Md. He was 63.
        The cause was complications from a brain tumor, his family said.

After working at the National Institutes of Health and the American Red Cross, he became director of blood banks at the Brooklyn-Cumberland Medical  Center in Brooklyn in 1970. He became director of the immunohematology branch at the Food and Drug Administration in 1974, and later the Division of Transfusion  Science at the agency. After also presiding over the Division of Blood and Blood Products, he left the Federal Government in 1991 to join the American Association of Blood Banks.
        He graduated from Boston College and earned a master's degree at Johns Hopkins University and a doctorate at the University of Wisconsin.
        He is survived by his wife, Eileen, of Potomac, Md.; three daughters, Apryll  Jacobowitz, of Gaithersburg, Md.; Elissa Solomon of Rockville, Md., and Elaina Solomon of Waldorf, Md.; a brother, Steven, of Fairfield, Conn., and one grandchild.
