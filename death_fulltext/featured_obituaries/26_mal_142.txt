        Dr. Tishler, a former president of Merck Sharp and Dohme Research Laboratories of Merck & Company Inc., where he worked for 33 years, had been emeritus University Professor of the Sciences at Wesleyan University in Middletown for the last 19 years. He published more than 100 scholarly papers and was listed as the inventor on some 100 United States patents.
        Among some of his accomplishments were the production of vaccines to control livestock and poultry diseases, and the development of commercial processes to manufacture vitamin B6, Vitamin K, Vitamin E, penicillin and cortisone. The mass production of cortisone opened a new era in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. He also developed drugs to treat heart disease and hypertension.
        Born in 1906 in Boston, Dr. Tishler decided at an early age to devote his life to the treatment of the sick after seeing, as a neighborhood errand boy, the suffering caused by the 1918 influenza epidemic. In 1928 he graduated from Tufts University with a degree in chemistry. Six years later he received a doctorate in chemistry from Harvard University, where he became an instructor before joining Merck laboratories in 1937.
        President Reagan presented Dr. Tishler a National Medal of Science in 1987.
        Surviving are his wife, Elizabeth, of Middletown; two sons, Peter, of Boston and Carl, of Columbus, Ohio; and three grandchildren.
