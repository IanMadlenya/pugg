        John Luigi Magro, a Cincinnati businessman who was a patron of the arts and a leading benefactor of Boys Town of Italy, died on April 18 at his home in Camden, Me., where he had retired in 1991. He was 90.
        Mr. Magro was born in Rochester and graduated from Harvard College in 1932. He ran several national and international business ventures from Cincinnati, including the John L. Magro Advertising Company; a candle manufacturer, the Candle-Lite Company; and two food enterprises, the Dextra Sugar Corporation and Doro d'Italia.
        Through his travels Mr. Magro came to know and support the Roman version of Boys Town, the home for troubled youths that Father Flanagan founded in Nebraska in 1917. Boys Town of Italy made Mr. Magro an honorary citizen, and Italy awarded him one of that nation's highest civilian decorations, the Cavaliere Dell'Ordine al Merito Della Repubblica Italiana.
        He served as a trustee and board president of the Cincinnati Opera and was connected with about 60 grand opera productions of the Cincinnati Summer Opera Association.

He also was affiliated with the University of Cincinnati College of Music, the National Ballet Theater Foundation, the American Ballet Theater and the National Conference of Christians and Jews, for which he served as co-chairman of the Cincinnati chapter.
        He is survived by his wife of more than 50 years, Nancy Post Magro; three daughters, Susan Pfeil of New Canaan, Conn., Nancy L. Magro of Brookline, Mass., and Victoria Pfeil of Cincinnati; two sons, Jonathan, of Cincinnati, and Benjamin, of Appleton, Me.; a sister, Mary Wilder of Harpers Ferry, W.
