        William L. Ryan, a retired special correspondent for The Associated Press, died yesterday after heart surgery at Greenwich (Conn.) Hospital. He was 77 years old and lived in Greenwich.
        Mr. Ryan's career included coverage of the Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev's 1959 American visit, Fidel Castro's rise in Cuba, and the Middle East crises of 1957-58.
        He joined The Associated Press in 1943 after working for The New York World and newspapers in Westchester County.
        He was assigned to A.P.'s Moscow bureau in 1953, and after his return to the United States the news agency published a series of his reports on the Soviet system under the title ''Ryan on Russia.''
        He was named special correspondent in 1967, one of only 10 people to hold that title with A.P.
        He is survived by his wife, Edythe.
