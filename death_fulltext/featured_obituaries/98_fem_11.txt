        Elizabeth Dorothy Futas, the director of the University of Rhode Island's Graduate School of Library and Information Studies, died on Feb. 6 in Philadelphia. She was 50 and lived in Wakefield, R.I.
        The cause has not been reported, according to the American Library Association in Chicago. Dr. Futas, a member of its governing council, was attending the association's midwinter meeting at the Pennsylvania Convention Center at the time.
        Dr. Futas took up her duties at the university in Kingston, R.I., in 1986 and during the next decade helped to train a generation of reference and children's book librarians. She also revamped the programs of the library school and within two years helped it to secure accreditation.
        She worked as a cataloguer for the Ford Foundation in New York and as a reference librarian at Queens College in the 1960's and 1970's. Before accepting the job at Rhode Island, she held faculty positions at Rutgers University, Emory University and the University of Washington in Seattle, among other institutions.
        She was the author of four books on library science, including "Library Acquisition Policies and Procedures" (Oryx Press; 3d edition, 1994), and "The Library Forms Illustrated Handbook" (Neal-Schuman, 1984).
        Born in Brooklyn, Dr. Futas was a political science graduate of Brooklyn College. She received a master's in librarian science at the University of Minnesota and a doctorate in information studies at Rutgers.
        She is survived by her mother, Eleanor Futas of Manhattan, and a sister, Susan Wagner of Bethesda, Md.
