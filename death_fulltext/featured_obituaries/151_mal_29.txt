        Anthony Stanislas Radziwill, a television executive who received both Emmy and Peabody Awards, died Tuesday at New York Presbyterian Hospital. He was 40 and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Radziwill, the only son of Lee Bouvier Radziwill Ross and the late Prince Stanislas Radziwill, had battled cancer for 10 years. He was a close friend of his cousin, John F. Kennedy Jr., and each had been best man at the other's wedding.
        Mr. Radziwill began his broadcasting career as an associate producer at NBC Sports at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul and received his first Emmy Award, for sports journalism. The next year he joined ABC News as a producer on ''Prime Time Live'' with Diane Sawyer and Sam Donaldson, specializing in investigative reporting. He worked on reports of the Rodney King beating, the Los Angeles riots and the O. J. Simpson trial.
        His investigative work on Neo-Nazism in the United States earned him a Peabody Award in 1990. That same year, he won a second Emmy Award for his work on ''Murder in Beverly Hills,'' a report on the Menendez double homicide case.
        Mr. Radziwill joined Time Warner's Home Box Office in 1997 as vice president for documentaries. He received a prime-time Emmy Award for a documentary called ''Taxicab Confessions'' and received Academy Award and Emmy Award nominations this year for ''Lenny Bruce: Swear to Tell the Truth.''
        Mr. Radziwill, the nephew of President John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who was his godmother, spent his childhood in England with his parents. He received a bachelor's degree in broadcast journalism from Boston University in 1982.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Carole Di Falco; his mother and his stepfather, Herbert Ross, and a sister, Anna Christina Radziwill of Manhattan.
