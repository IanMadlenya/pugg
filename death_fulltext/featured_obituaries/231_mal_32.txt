        Peter F. Karches, a former Wall Street executive who spent 25 years at Morgan Stanley, died Thursday at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. He was 54.
        The cause was chronic lymphocytic leukemia, said his wife, Susan.
        Mr. Karches, who earned a bachelor's degree in finance from Georgetown University in 1974 and a master's in business administration from Columbia University in 1976, began his long career at Morgan Stanley immediately after finishing graduate school.
        He became a managing director in 1985. He was appointed chief of the worldwide fixed-income division in 1992. In that position, he had management responsibility for a wide range of trading and sales operations -- from corporate bonds to mortgage-backed securities to high-yield bonds in emerging markets.
        In 1997, Mr. Karches became president and chief operating officer of the institutional securities and investment banking group. He held that position until he retired in August 2000.
        Peter Frederick Karches was born in Brooklyn on Dec. 16, 1951. He grew up an avid fan of horse racing, his wife said, and he later bred and raced thoroughbreds himself. He was a co-chairman of the New York Racing Association.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by three daughters, Amy, Pamela and Nancy; and a son, Peter Jr., all of Locust Valley; a brother, Robert, of Orchard Park, N.Y.; and his mother, Clara, of Westbury, N.Y.
