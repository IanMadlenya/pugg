        Theodore Van Dam, a philatelic writer and historian of the handling of mail in wartime, died in Los Angeles on May 1. He was 84.
        The cause was leukemia, his family said.
        Mr. Van Dam's special interests led him to produce several books on postal markings used by the American Expeditionary Force, which fought in Europe at the end of World War I, and on the postal history of Spain, especially the confused period of the Spanish Civil War, 1936-39.
        Such turbulent times interest collectors of stamps and postal history because war forces the authorities to improvise the delivery of letters and packages, and the stamps and markings reflect such changes.
        He also produced a work titled ''A Century of War Dates 1859-1959,'' which helped collectors identify wartime material from ''the Italian War of Liberation to the Vietnam War,'' as the subtitle explained.
        Mr. Van Dam's reference works have remained in print since he began publishing in his 40's, and he contributed to updated editions well into his 80's.
        Mr. Van Dam was born in Amsterdam on Aug. 15, 1916, and immigrated to New York in 1937. He served in the Pacific area with the 98th Infantry Division from 1942 to 1946, and his facility with languages led him to serve as a translator to aid in the repatriation of prisoners of war held by the Japanese, his wife said.
        When he returned to New York, he joined his two brothers working for the Van Dam Rubber Company, which had been developed by an uncle. But he soon left the company to expand his philatelic research and writing.
        He married the former Marjorie Biggs in 1957.
        In addition to Mrs. Van Dam, he is survived by his brother, Albert, of Amsterdam, and a stepson, Lawrence W. Markes IV, of Los Angeles.
