He started a career as a consulting engineer in Manhattan and served as a major in the Army Air Corps in World War II before he joined Coverdale & Colpitts in 1945. He retired in 1975, several years after the company had been acquired by the URS Corporation.
        Mr. Brown is survived by his wife, Natalie; a son, Donald Kendrick Brown of Denton, Tex.; a daughter, Joan Catherine Winston of Fairfax, Va., and seven grandchildren.
