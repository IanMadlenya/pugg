        Jocelyn Herbert, a noted British stage designer, died on Tuesday in London. She was 86.
        She is remembered in Britain for her austere, intelligently illuminated and evocative stage settings. They included the sets for the 1964 production of ''Othello,'' with Laurence Olivier, at the National Theater in London.
        She also designed for opera, notably for the Metropolitan Opera's 1977 production of ''Lulu,'' for which her sets and costumes evoked a world touched by the Bauhaus, Art Moderne and German bourgeois styles.
        She was educated chiefly in British schools, including the Slade School of Art, where she studied stage design.
        In the mid-1950's she became a scene painter for the Royal Court Theater in London for a time. She designed for stage productions including Ionesco's ''Chairs'' (1958) and Arnold Wesker's ''Roots'' (1959), both at the Royal Court, and John Osborne's play ''Luther'' at the St. James Theater in Manhattan in 1963. Beginning in the late 1960's she designed opera for several institutional clients. She also did design work on various movies, including ''The Hotel New Hampshire'' and ''The Whales of August.''
        She was born in London to Sir Alan P. Herbert, a member of Parliament, writer and humorist, and his wife, Gwendolen.
        She is survived by a son and three daughters.
