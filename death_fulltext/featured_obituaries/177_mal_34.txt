        Luis Antonio García Navarro, one of Spain's best known conductors and the first music and artistic director of Madrid's newly restored opera house, the Teatro Real, died on Oct. 10 in a Madrid clinic after a long illness. He was 61.
        The cause of death was cancer, according to Spanish newspapers.
        Mr. García Navarro, whose 30-year career led him to conduct orchestras across Europe and the United States, took leave from his post at the Teatro Real in the spring because of ill health. His final appearance at the Teatro Real in March was to conduct a new production of Wagner's ''Parsifal,'' with Plácido Domingo in the lead role.
        Born on April 30, 1940, in Chiva in the eastern province of Valencia, Mr. García Navarro inherited his love of music from his father, an amateur guitarist. As a student at music conservatories in Spain and in Vienna, he concentrated on the oboe, piano and composition. He made his operatic debut in Valencia in 1970.
        Although he was later guest conductor at the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and also led Madrid's National Orchestra, he became best known as an opera conductor, directing operas in Paris, Salzburg, Lisbon, Barcelona, Stuttgart, Vienna, Prague and Tokyo as well as at La Scala in Milan and the Metropolitan Opera in New York.
        His biggest challenge came in 1997 when he was named music and artistic director at the Teatro Real, a 19th-century opera house that had long been closed and had not staged an opera in 72 years.
        There was political in-fighting over the institution's future, but he gradually asserted himself and won praise from Spanish music critics for his choice of operas and his musical interpretation.
        ''He has left us with a magnificent 'Parsifal' under his arm as his final testimony,'' wrote Juan A. Vela del Campo, music critic of the Madrid daily, El País.
        Mr. García Navarro is survived by his wife, Amparo, and their two children, Enrique and Estela.
