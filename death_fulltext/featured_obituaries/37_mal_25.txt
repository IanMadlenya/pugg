        Gianfranco Contini, a linguist and literary critic, died on Thursday. He was 78 years old.
        Mr. Contini had been partly paralyzed since last year, but the cause of his death was not reported.
        He was a professor of philology, and gained worldwide recognition for his analysis of the literary techniques used by Italian masters like Dante and Petrarch and for his critiques of his contemporaries.
        He began his career as a professor at the University of Freiburg in Germany. He later taught in Pisa and Florence, where he lived.
        Among his publications are critical editions of Dante's ''Rhymes'' and of the Italian poets of the 13th century, and his ''Literature of Unified Italy.''
        Surviving are his wife, Margareth, and two sons.
