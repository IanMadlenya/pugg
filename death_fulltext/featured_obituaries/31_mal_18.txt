        Eugene Vanderpool, an American archeologist who believed he had identified the site of the prison where Socrates was executed in 399 B.C., died of Parkinson's disease Tuesday in the Evangelismos Hospital in Athens. He was 83 years old and had lived in Athens for most of the time since 1932.
        Professor Vanderpool, a native of Morristown, N.J., retired 15 years ago after nearly 50 years on the faculty of the American School of Classical Studies in Athens.
        He was awarded the Gold Medal for Distinguished Achievement of the Archeological Institute of America in 1975.
        Studies in the mid-1970's led Professor Vanderpool to believe that remnants of an ancient structure that were discovered in 1949 in the southwest corner of the ancient agora, or market, at the foot of the Acropolis, were the remains of the prison where Socrates spent the last month of his life.
        Mr. Vanderpool received a bachelor's degree at Princeton University, where he also did graduate work in the classics and in archeology.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Joan Jeffreys; a sister, Mary Cochran of Morristown; a son, Eugene Vanderpool Jr. of Athens; and three daughters, Joan Gayley of West Hartford, Conn., Ann Lewenduski of Madison, Conn., Lisa Evert of Athens; eight grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
