        Mr. Appelbaum was born in Berlin and began playing the piano at the age of 4. He studied with the renowned German pianist Artur Schnabel, and made his debut in Berlin in 1930.
        The pianist immigrated to New York in 1939, one year after a successful debut at Town Hall. He had an active concert career, specializing in the works of Beethoven and Schubert. In the late 1940's he began recording the 32 Beethoven Sonatas for Westminster Records, but the project was left incomplete when the company went out of business.
        He had taught privately for the last 25 years.
        There are no immediate survivors.
