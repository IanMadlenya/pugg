        Dr. Thomas C. O'Brien, a leading authority on the works of Thomas Aquinas and the editor of a 60-volume English translation of the 13th-century theologian's "Summa Theologica," died on Tuesday in Chambersburg, Pa. He was 67 years old and lived in Chambersburg.
        Dr. O'Brien died of lung cancer, said John Page, executive secretary of the International Commission on English in the Liturgy. Dr. O'Brien had worked with the commission since 1979.
        When publication of the "Summa Theologica" translation was undertaken by McGraw-Hill in 1964, Dr. O'Brien, then a Catholic priest, helped lead a team of more than 24 priests who edited eight volumes a year.
        The "Summa Theologica" is held as the highest achievement of medieval theological systematization, delineating Aquinas's assertion that many fundamental Christian verities lie beyond reason and are revealed in Scripture.
        Dr. O'Brien, who left the priesthood in 1966 and was married a year later, was born in Providence, R.I. After graduating from Providence College, he did graduate studies at the University of St. Thomas in Rome and later taught philosophy and theology at the Dominican House of Studies and Immaculata College in Washington, and the Hartford Seminary Foundation in Connecticut. He had been ordained in the Dominican Order in 1950.
        He is survived by his wife, Florence; two brothers, Raymond, of Falls Church, Va., and the Rev. John Pius O'Brien of Kenya, and a sister, Claire McGeehan of Myrtle Beach, S.C.
