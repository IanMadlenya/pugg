        Lester S. Block, a retired senior vice president for R. H. Macy & Company, died at his home in Princeton, N.J., on Sept. 1. He was 76.
        The cause was heart disease, a family spokesman said.
        During his 30-year career at Macy's, Mr. Block served on the board of directors of the American Retail Association and was chairman of the Human Resources Committee of the New York Chamber of Commerce. He founded the Advisory Panel on Employment Litigation, a group representing prominent law firms involved with issues affecting the city's business community.
        At Macy's he served as vice president of labor and government relations.
        He was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Princeton University and then graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Law School, where he was director of the Law School Review. He joined the legal department at Macy's in 1954.
        He is survived by his wife, Ruth; two sons, John of New York City and Richard of Scarsdale, N.Y., and a sister, Carolyn Lavine of Charleston, S.C.
