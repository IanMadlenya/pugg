        Merl L. Rouse, a retired insurance executive and leader in the reinsurance industry, died on Monday at Berkshire Medical Center in Pittsfield, Mass. Mr. Rouse, who was 85, was a longtime resident of Manhattan until he moved to Stockbridge, Mass., last year.
        As chief executive of the American Re-Insurance Company from 1961 to 1975, Mr. Rouse was instrumental in prodding the company to expand overseas. During his tenure, the company opened offices in Australia, Canada and London, preparing the way to become one of the world's largest reinsurance companies, specializing in insuring other insurance companies against losses they might suffer from liability insurance policies.
        One of the companies Mr. Rouse acquired was the Inter-Ocean Reinsurance Company of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, a reinsurer for crop and hail insurance companies, where he had worked for 18 years, starting in 1928.
        Mr. Rouse was also a founder and the first chairman of the Reinsurance Association of America, a Washington trade group organized to address the needs of reinsurance companies as they differed from those of their customers, insurance companies.
        Mr. Rouse, who was born in Urbana, Iowa, lived in Manhattan for 60 years, beginning in 1934, when he was transferred to the city by Inter-Ocean. At various times, he was a board member of the Wall Street Club and a governor of the New York Board of Trade.
        He was educated at the Cedar Rapids Business College and in courses of the Insurance Institute.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Imogene Nern Rector; a daughter, Margaret Rouse Quinn of Albuquerque, N.M.; a son, James E. Rouse of Cataumet, Mass.; a brother, Dr. Robert L. Rouse of Lubbock, Tex., and four step-grandchildren.
