        Daniel Katz, a retired University of Michigan psychology professor who was an expert on organizational psychology, died on Feb. 28. He was 94 and lived in Ann Arbor, Mich.
        Professor Katz won the American Psychological Association's Gold Medal Award in 1973, when he retired from his professorship after 26 years at the university. He was active in the Institute for Social Research at the university as well as the psychology department. After 1973 he continued to do work for the institute. He also kept on writing in his field into the 1990's.
        He took part in a sweeping survey of the opinions of employees of the Detroit Edison Company in the late 1940's and found that the lack of suspicion among 8,000 workers indicated good worker-management relations. His writings include the book ''The Social Psychology of Organizations'' (1978, Wiley), of which he was a co-author.
        From 1928 to 1943, he was on the Princeton University faculty. From 1943 to 1947 he headed the Brooklyn College psychology department. He also worked for the War Department in World War II.
        Professor Katz was born in Trenton. He received a bachelor's degree from the University of Buffalo in 1925 and his doctorate from Syracuse University in 1928.
        He married Christine Braley in 1930; she died in 1983.
        He is survived by two daughters, Joanna Katz of Oakland, Calif., and Jean Carwardine of Jacksonville, Fla., and a sister, Svea Sommer of Norwalk, Conn.
