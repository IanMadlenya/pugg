        Dave Swid, a former president of the Yale Express Trucking Company and of a business that helped build the New England Thruway, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 86 years old and lived in West Palm Beach, Fla.
        Mr. Swid, who had lived for many years in the Murray Hill section of Manhattan, died of heart failure, said his son, Stephen, the chairman of the Municipal Art Society.
        Mr. Swid was born in Cleveland, studied architecture at Ohio State University and later worked in the garage and trucking industries in New York City.
        In the late 1930's, he went into the trucking business on his own with various companies, of which Yale Express emerged as the largest in the 1940's.
        As president, he oversaw the company's operations throughout the Northeast until 1953, when the company went out of business after a strike.
        In the 1950's and 1960's, Mr. Swid was president of Swid Contractors, which won contracts to build parts of what was then called the Connecticut Turnpike and is now known as the New England Thruway.
        Mr. Swid married Selma Claar in 1934. She died in 1960.
        He is survived by his second wife, the former Dorothy Zeiss, a physics teacher in New York City schools; two children from his first marriage, Carole Swid Eisner and Stephen C. Swid, both of Manhattan, and eight grandchildren.
