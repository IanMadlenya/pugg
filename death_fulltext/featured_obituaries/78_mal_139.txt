        Donald McAllister, a business-publications executive active in his family's concern for more than seven decades, died on Thursday at New York Hospital. He was 91 and had homes in Manhattan and Centre Island, L.I.
        The cause was prostate cancer, his family said.
        At his death, Mr. McAllister was chairman of Geyer-McAllister Publications Inc. Its flagship magazine is Gifts and Decorative Accessories, a monthly that marked its 75th anniversary last year. Another is Playthings magazine, dating to 1903.
        Mr. McAllister, a native of Ithaca, N.Y., graduated from Cornell University in 1922. That year he joined Geyer Publications, founded by his uncle, Andrew Geyer, in 1877, and one of the oldest magazine publishers in continuous family ownership.
        Mr. McAllister started as an editorial assistant and rose to vice president and advertising director by 1936. After World War II, he was promoted to general manager. He became president in 1958 and chairman in 1968.
        In recent years, Mr. McAllister took a hand in business-press education for journalism students. A former chairman of American Business Press, a publishers association, he endowed a McAllister Fellowship under its auspices to acquaint students with prominent publishers.
        Mr. McAllister's wife, the former Betty Myers, died in 1990. He is survived by a son, Donald Jr. of Riverdale, and a daughter, Liane Elizabeth McAllister of Manhattan.
