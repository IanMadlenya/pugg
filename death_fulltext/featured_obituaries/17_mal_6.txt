        Laurence H. Kaye, a prominent figure in the fur industry for several decades, died of heart failure yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 84 years old.
        For nearly three decades until his retirement two years ago, he was the owner of Laurence Kaye Furs, a Seventh Avenue concern that produced a line of expensive furs. For some years he made the Christian Dior fur collection, and more recently the Hubert Givenchy collection.
        Mr. Kaye was born in Manhattan and attended New York University. He was associated with Russeks Fifth Avenue and was a vice president of Ritter Brothers Furs before starting his own concern.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Janet Douglas; a daughter, Terry Silver of Manhattan; a son, Lester of San Jose, Calif.; two brothers, Jack of Manhattan and Richard of Denver; a sister, Mae Kleinman of Long Island, and six grandchildren.
