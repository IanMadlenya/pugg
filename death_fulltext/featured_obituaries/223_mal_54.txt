        R. Frederic Fisher, a maritime and conservation lawyer who was a co-founder of Earthjustice, a public-interest law firm in San Francisco pledged to the defense of the environment, died on Aug. 16 at his home in Inverness, Calif. He was 68.
        The cause was cancer, the organization said on its Web site.
        Fred Fisher, as he was known, was an established maritime and conservation lawyer in San Francisco in the mid-1960's when he and a partner, H. Donald Harris, volunteered to help the Sierra Club fight development plans for the Mineral King Valley in the Sierra Nevada. Mr. Fisher and Mr. Harris founded the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund in 1971.
        The fund was renamed Earthjustice in 1997 to reflect its widening clientele. Supported by its membership, Earthjustice, with a staff of 140 and an annual budget of $30 million, represents hundreds of parties in cases involving public lands, national forests, wilderness areas, pollution and wildlife habitat.
        Mr. Fisher, its founding vice president, was board chairman from 1995 to 2000. He had remained an active board member and trustee since then.
        Robert Frederic Fisher was born in St. Louis and graduated in 1958 from Principia College in Elsah, Ill. He received his law degree in 1961 from Stanford Law School, where he was an editor for The Stanford Law Review. He worked at the firm of Lillick, McHose & Charles and became a partner in the maritime regulatory department. In 1994, he joined the Washington firm of Sher & Blackwell, opening a San Francisco office, from which he retired in 1999.
        Mr. Fisher is survived by his wife, Susan Kugler Fisher; two sons, Matthew F., of San Francisco, and Jonathan J., of Inverness; and a brother, Jonathan, of Great Falls, Va.
