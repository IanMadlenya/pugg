        Dr. Kenneth D. Bird, an internist and pulmonary specialist who developed a method of examining patients by two-way, interactive television, died Wednesday at the Lahey Clinic in Burlington, Mass. He was 73 years old and lived in Lexington, Mass.
        He died of heart failure, said a spokesman for Massachusetts General Hospital, where Dr. Bird was affiliated for nearly four decades.
        In 1968 Dr. Bird founded and directed the first "telemedicine" system, which linked a medical station at Boston's Logan Airport with doctors at the hospital who supplied remote diagnosis, treatment and medical image transmission. In 1970 a second link was opened.
        The telemedicine system, a precursor of today's high-technology conferences that links doctors around the world electronically, was abandoned in the 1970's.
        Dr. Bird was a graduate of Harvard College and the Harvard Medical School. He served as an Army captain in the Korean War.
        Survivors include his wife, the former Jean Allen; five sons, Peter, of Hollis, N.H., Christopher, of Glastonbury, Conn., Duncan, of Lexington, Mass., Gregory, of Arlington, Mass., and Jeffrey, of Hamilton, Mass.; a brother, Carl, of Belmont, Mass.; a sister, Phyllis Kilroy of Baltimore, and five grandchildren.
