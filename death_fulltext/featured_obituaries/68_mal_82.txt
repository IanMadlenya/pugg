        Budd Buszek, a former advertising executive and president of the Traffic Audit Bureau, died on Sept. 10 at his home in Margaretville, N.Y. He was 76.
        Mr. Buszek died from complications related to cancer, said Pamela Richards, a spokeswoman for the family.
        Mr. Buszek joined the Traffic Audit Bureau as its president and managing director in 1971. The bureau measures the visibility of advertising on billboards and posters in airports and depots and on ground transit vehicles. He resigned in 1979 and opened his own international advertising consulting firm, International Outdoor Advertising Consultancy.
        Born in Lindsay, Calif., Mr. Buszek earned a bachelor's degree at the University of California at Berkeley in 1940 and then attended a special two-year program at the United States Naval Academy for its commando corps. He served with the Navy until the end of the war.
        Mr. Buszek got his start in the advertising business in California after the war, specializing in the so-called out-of-home media market. He went on to became director of the out-of-home media division for the advertising firm of Batten Barton Durstine & Osborn in the 1950's. During that time, he headed the industry board overseeing the Traffic Audit Bureau's measuring practices for several years.
        Mr. Buszek is survived by two sisters, Joan Black, of Visalia, Calif., and Dorothy Stadtmiller of Lindsay, Calif.
