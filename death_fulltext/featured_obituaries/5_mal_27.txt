        Bruno Bernard, a photographer known as Bruno of Hollywood, died of cancer Wednesday in Los Angeles. He was 75 years old.
        Mr. Bernard, who photographed such stars as Clark Gable, Tyrone Power and Elizabeth Taylor, was credited with introducing Marilyn Monroe to Jimmy Hyde, the agent who got her a contract with 20th Century-Fox. ''Remember Bernie, you started it all,'' the actress wrote in one of Mr. Bernard's 10 books on photography. One of his best-known pictures was of Miss Monroe in a windblown skirt. He was honored for his work last year by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
        Mr. Bernard is survived by a daughter, Susan, and a grandson, Joshua Miller.
