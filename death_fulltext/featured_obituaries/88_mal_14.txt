        Dan L. Thrapp, a chronicler of the American West, died on Friday at his home in Tucson, Ariz. He was 80.
        The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage, his family said.
        A native of West Chicago, Mr. Thrapp began his travels as a paleontologist for the New York Museum of Natural History in the 1930's. At one point the museum ordered an aerial search for Mr. Thrapp when it feared he had been lost in a solo exploration of cliff-dweller ruins in an unmapped canyon region of southern Utah.
        In World War II, he served with the Army in Burma and China, became a captain and won four battle stars. After the war he was a foreign correspondent for United Press in England, Greece, Italy and Africa. He joined The Los Angeles Times as religion editor in 1951 and retired from that position in 1975.
        Mr. Thrapp was an authority on the Apache wars in Arizona and New Mexico in the second half of the 19th century and wrote six books on the subject. They included "Al Sieber, Chief of Scouts" in 1964 and "The Conquest of Apacheria" in 1967.
        He also wrote a four-volume "Encyclopedia of Frontier Biography," published by the University of Nebraska Press in 1991.
        Mr. Thrapp is survived by a daughter, Linda Nicholl of Seattle; a son, Col. Richard Platte of Washington; and three sisters, Dorothy Reisner of New Paltz, N.Y., Josephine Drexler of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and Beatrice Zeeck of Lubbock, Tex.
