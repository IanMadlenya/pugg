        Albert L. Fiorillo, a retired judge in Westchester County, died on Thursday at the Andrus Retirement Community in Hastings-on-Hudson. He was 93 years old and a resident of Yonkers until six years ago.
        He died of heart failure, his family said.
        Judge Fiorillo, a native of Caserta, Italy, came to this country at the age of 5. He received his bachelor's and law degrees from Fordham University and went into private practice in New York.
        He became Justice of the Peace in Yonkers in 1930 and was elected to a two-year term as president of that city's Board of Aldermen in 1937. It was during his tenure on the board that he formed a close relationship with Malcolm Wilson, who was Governor of New York in 1973-74. Mr. Fiorillo helped him start his first political campaign in 1938 when Mr. Wilson successfully ran for the State Assembly.
        On the bench, Mr. Fiorillo had both Republican and Democratic support. He was a city judge in Yonkers from 1948 to 1962, when Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller appointed him Westchester Children's Court Judge. Later that year, he was elected to the county Family Court, where he sat until he turned 70, the mandatory retirement age, in 1968.
        Mr. Fiorillo then returned to private practice. He was of counsel to the Yonkers law firm of Farley, Jutkowitz, Locascio & Belint into his mid-80's. Last September, he briefly came out of judicial retirement, receiving special dispensation at the age of 92 to perform the wedding ceremony of his granddaughter, Amy L. Lewis, in Granite Springs, N.Y.
        Judge Fiorillo is also survived by a son, Albert L. of Manhattan; two daughters, Alberta F. Lewis and Dr. Frances Fiorillo Newman, both of Scarsdale, N.Y.; two other grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter.
