        Florence Jessie MacWilliams, a mathematician and a developer of the digital coding used in computers and telecommunications, died of an embolism on Sunday at Morristown (N.J.) Memorial Hospital. She was 73 years old and lived in Bernardsville, N.J.
        Mrs. MacWilliams was on the staff of A.T. & T. Bell Laboratories for 24 years and contributed to developing the coding to correct telephone and satellite communications errors. With Neil Sloane, she wrote a text, ''The Theory of Error-Correcting Codes.''
        A graduate of Cambridge University, Mrs. MacWilliams joined Bell Labs in 1957. She received a doctorate from Harvard in 1962. Mrs. MacWilliams discovered a set of fundamental equations, the MacWilliams Identities. She retired in 1982.
        Surviving are her husband, Walter; a daughter, Anne Riley Patterson of Princeton, N.J.; a son, Harry, of Munich, West Germany, and four grandchildren.
