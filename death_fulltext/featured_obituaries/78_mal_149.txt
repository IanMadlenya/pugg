        Richard Assatly, a skilled designer who worked in all facets of ready-to-wear, died on Sunday at New York University Medical Center. He was 49.
        The cause of death was respiratory failure, said Gregory Habeeb, a nephew.
        Starting in 1985, Mr. Assatly was a co-designer at Anne Klein II, but for about 20 years before that he worked at various Seventh Avenue companies, including Pat Sandler, a dress house, in the mid-1960's, and Originala, a coat and suit manufacturer. He also had his own business in the 1970's, where the label read "Richard Assatly for Gino Snow." His financial backers were Gino de Georgio, Joe Snow and Ben Shaw.
        "His clothes had a real modern edge," said Donna Karan, a longtime friend. "He followed the general direction of fashion, but he gave his interpretations a special twist. Basically, he was a tailor -- he made beautiful suits -- and he was able to translate this tailoring skill into dresses that were severe but sexy."
        Louis Dell'Olio, a friend since Originala days, who worked with Mr. Assatly recently at Anne Klein, called his clothes "young and always of the moment -- he seemed to feel what was going on before it happened."
        The designer was born into the fashion business. His father, William Assatly, was a manufacturer of robes and loungewear. His company was known as Dorian Robes.
        Richard Assatly grew up in Brooklyn and Princeton, N.J. He attended business school briefly in New Jersey and then, realizing that his first love was fashion, moved to New York and enrolled in the Fashion Institute of Technology.
        He worked until a few months ago, finishing his last collection, resort and early spring. He was still sketching clothes until his last day, his associates said.
        He is survived by a sister, Virgenie Habeeb of Westchester County, and a brother, William Jr. of Manhattan.
