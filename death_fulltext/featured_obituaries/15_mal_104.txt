        Dr. Morton Berger, dean of the Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology at Yeshiva University, died Thursday night in a car accident on the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway as he was driving to his home in Albany. He was 53 years old and maintained an apartment in the Bronx.
        Dr. Berger held a degree in Jewish education from the Teaching Institute of Yeshiva University and a doctorate in clinical psychology from the University of Massachusetts. He had worked as staff psychologist at several Albany hospitals and, in 1971, became executive secretary of the State Board for Psychology of the State Education Department.
        He was appointed dean at Yeshiva in 1977. From 1977 until 1980 he also served as university dean for the behavioral and social sciences.
        Dr. Berger was entering the Thruway at Ramapo, N.Y., about 10:20 P.M. Thursday when a car going the wrong way struck his vehicle head-on, a Yeshiva University spokesman said.
        Dr. Berger is survived by his wife, the former Hope Goldman; a daughter, Linda Spivack of Wallingford, Conn.; two sons, Howard of Manhattan and Alan of the Bronx, and a brother, Bernard of Netanya, Israel.
