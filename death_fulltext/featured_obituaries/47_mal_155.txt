        Robert Spitzer, the owner of the Treadwell Corporation, which makes oxygen-generating equipment, died on Monday at St. Clare's Hospital in Manhattan after collapsing in the lobby of a midtown building. He was 63 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He apparently died of a heart attack, a spokesman for his company said.
        Mr. Spitzer was principal owner of Treadwell, a construction and engineering company with headquarters in Moonachie, N.J. He designed and developed oxygen-generating equipment for use aboard nuclear submarines. He was also a trustee and past president of the Heart Research Foundation.
        He was a 1946 graduate of New York University School of Engineering.
        He is survived by his wife, Joyce.
