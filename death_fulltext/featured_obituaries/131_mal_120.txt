        Raymond A. Ericson, a music critic for The New York Times for nearly three decades, died yesterday at Danbury Hospital in Connecticut. He was 82 and lived in Sherman, Conn.
        Mr. Ericson, who had worked as an organist and choir director before joining The Times, was partial to  Baroque and Romantic music, but he covered the broad spectrum of classical music with a genial openness.
        In person, he was soft-spoken but authoritative, and in his reviews he tended to treat performers with a respectful generosity, often registering his quibbles about interpretive questions almost as asides.
        Mr. Ericson was born in Brooklyn in 1915. He graduated from North Park Junior College in Chicago with an associate degree in mathematics in 1934, and he continued his studies in music and mathematics at the University of Chicago. From 1939 to 1942, when he joined the Army Air Corps, he was an associate music and drama reviewer at The Chicago Tribune.
        After military service Mr. Ericson  returned to New York, where he worked briefly as a press agent for a theatrical production company and as organist and choir director of the Pilgrim Covenant Church in Brooklyn.
        In 1949 he joined the staff of Musical America, and by the mid-50's was the magazine's managing editor. He left to join The Times in 1960.
        Mr. Ericson began his career at The Times as the editor of the Sunday recordings page, but from the start he also wrote concert and record reviews as well as feature articles and, for several years, ''Music Notes,'' a weekly news column.
        He retired in 1981 but continued to contribute reviews, features and summer festival guides to The Times until he was incapacitated by a stroke in 1990.
        He is survived by his companion, Frank Milburn.
