        George Becker, who at 15 literally followed his father's footsteps into a steel mill in his Illinois hometown and rose to become the sixth president of the United Steelworkers union, died on Saturday at his home in Gibsonia, Pa. He was 78.
        The cause was prostate cancer, his son Gregory said.
        As the union president from 1993 to 2001, Mr. Becker led a significant reorganization, raising membership to close to 850,000 from about 700,000. He accomplished that largely through mergers, at a time globalization was cutting union membership. In 1995, the steelworkers merged with the United Rubber Workers Union, and in 1996 with the Aluminum Brick and Glass Union, bringing in about 140,000 members.
        George Frederick Becker was born on Oct. 20, 1928, in Granite City, Ill., a son of Frances and George Becker Sr. The family lived in a two-bedroom house within 100 feet of the gates of the Granite City Steel Company mill, where the father worked.
        In 1944, while in high school, Mr. Becker took a job on an open-hearth crew at the mill. Two years later, he joined the Marines, serving until 1948. From 1950 to 1956, he served in the Army, rising to master sergeant.
        In 1950, Mr. Becker married Jane Goforth. Besides his wife and son Gregory, of Edwardsville, Ill., surviving are 2 other sons Matthew, of Glenshaw, Pa., and George, of Pittsburgh; a sister, Jacqueline Strauss of Glen Carbon, Ill.; 10 grandchildren; and 5 great-grandchildren.
        After his military service, Mr. Becker returned to work at Granite City Steel. In the late '50s, he had a job at the Dow Chemical plant in Madison, Ill., where he became a shop steward and eventually the local union president.
        In 1965, he joined the staff of the United Steelworkers of America, and 10 years later was named its director for safety and health. In 1985, he was elected one of the union's two vice presidents. In that capacity, Mr. Becker organized ''a historic battle, ending an illegal lockout that many in the labor movement didn't believe we could win,'' the union's current president, Leo Gerard, said yesterday.
        In 1990, the Ravenswood Aluminum Company in West Virginia locked out 1,700 union members and hired nonunion replacements. The company was owned by Marc Rich, a billionaire who had fled to Switzerland to avoid federal charges of racketeering and mail fraud.
        Mr. Becker organized a campaign that persuaded beer companies to stop buying Ravenswood aluminum and prompted state legislatures to investigate the company; he sent delegations to publicize the lockout in countries where Mr. Rich was trying to close deals. In 1992, union workers returned to Ravenswood.
        ''I have one overall goal in life,'' Mr. Becker said in a 1999 interview, ''and that is to reverse the trend of deindustrializing America.''
