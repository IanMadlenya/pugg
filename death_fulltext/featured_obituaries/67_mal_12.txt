        Dr. William Weidman, the former chief of staff of the Arabian American Oil Company hospital in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, died July 30 at Fairfax Hospital in Fairfax, Va. He was 70 years old and lived in Great Falls, Va.
        Dr. Weidman died of liver failure as a result of chronic hepatits, said a son, Dr. Richard C. Weidman, of Reston, Va.
        A native of Manhattan, Dr. Weidman graduated from New York University in 1939 and the New York University Medical School in 1943. During World War II he served in the Navy aboard troop convoys in the Pacific.
        He returned to New York for postgraduate work in internal medicine.  He later became associated with the Arabian American Oil Company, or Aramco, the partnership between the major American oil companies and the Government of Saudi Arabia.
        In 1954 Dr. Weidman was hired by Aramco and sent to its hospital in Dhahran. That hospital and the American University hospital in Beirut were the only two with American accreditations in the Middle East. Dr. Weidman retired in 1980 and returned to the United States.
        In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife, Mary Ellen; another son, W. Jeffrey Weidman of Reston; a daughter, Ann Weidman Judge, of Aldie, Va.; a brother, George Weidman, of Atlanta, and one granddaughter.
