        Wulff-Dieter Heintz, an astronomer who was a leading investigator of the fiery evolution of linked pairs of stars, died on June 10 in Swarthmore, Pa. He was 76.
        The cause was lung cancer. Dr. Heintz was a lifelong smoker, his family said.
        Dr. Heintz, an astronomer at Swarthmore College, studied visual double stars to calculate the orbit of each star in a pair. In 1978, Dr. Heintz published ''Double Stars,'' a book that became a ''standard in the field, '' according to one expert.
        Dr. Heintz also studied Mars and helped measure about 900 newly observed double stars.
        Wulff-Dieter Heintz was born in Würzburg, Germany. He earned his doctorate in astronomy from the University of Munich in 1953.
        He did research at Munich's observatory and its station in Australia before arriving at Swarthmore in 1969.
        He remained a German citizen and was an author on the game of chess.
        Dr. Heintz is survived by his wife of 49 years, the former Dietlind Laschek of Swarthmore.
        He is also survived by a son, Robert, of Arlington, Mass.; a daughter, Ruth of Bethlehem, N.H.; two sisters, Monika Heintz of Munich and Ursula Heintz-Eberlein of Würzburg; and one grandchild.
