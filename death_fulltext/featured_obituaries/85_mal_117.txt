        Gideon Chagy, an arts consultant, writer and broadcaster, died on Sunday at St. Clare's Hospital. He was 78 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Lea.
        Before retiring in 1989, Mr. Chagy ran Gideon Chagy & Associates, a consulting firm that specialized in aiding nonprofit arts organizations. Earlier in his career, he was a consultant to the United States Information Agency, a vice president of Iona College and a vice president of the Business Committee for the Arts. He also served on the board of the Alliance of Independent Colleges of Art and as a member of the Public Advisory Group of the National Endowment for the Arts.
        Mr. Chagy wrote several books, including "The New Patrons of the Arts." In 1963, his editorials on political affairs won an Emmy Award for WCBS-TV in New York. He later served as the director of editorial services for CBS.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Rina Thompson of Toronto.
