        M. Abbott Van Nostrand, who for 38 years served as president and chief executive of Samuel French Inc., the largest licenser of plays in the English-speaking world, died on Wednesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in Manhattan. He was 84.
        From 1952 until his retirement in 1990, Mr. Van Nostrand presided over the agency, which publishes the works of many major playwrights and licenses the works of thousands more to professional theaters, amateur groups and high school drama clubs throughout the world.
        Since 1990, he served as the company's president emeritus, and had been working in its Manhattan offices until shortly before his death.
        Mr. Van Nostrand was born in Kew Gardens, Queens, and joined Samuel French shortly after graduating from Amherst College in 1934. He worked his way up from the shipping department to the executive suite, said his nephew, Charles R. Van Nostrand, who is now the agency's president.
        The list of playwrights with whom his company has been associated includes most of the famous names in the theater, from Eugene O'Neill and Samuel Beckett, to contemporary writers like Caryl Churchill, Ntozake Shange and Tom Stoppard. Thornton Wilder was a friend of Mr. Van Nostrand, who had many close friends in the theater.
        He is survived by his wife, Julia Eaton Van Nostrand; four daughters: Randall Van Nostrand of San Francisco; Abbie Schwartz of Greenwich, Conn.; Pamela Newton of Nova Scotia, and Patricia Hacker of New York; 13 grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
