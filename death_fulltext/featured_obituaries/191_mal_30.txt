        His book ''A Complete Guide to Bird Feeding'' was published in 1975 and republished in revised and updated form in 1994. It has been credited with increasing the number of bird-feeding enthusiasts. The book included recipes, frequently featuring cornmeal and cracked corn, to attract certain types of birds.

He was a sergeant in the Army Signal Corps in the China-Burma Theater in World War II. After the war, he worked for the Massachusetts Audubon Society as a sanctuary director and oversaw the Nantucket Ornithological Station. Later, he was a field researcher for the Nature Conservancy.
