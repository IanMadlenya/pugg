        Lieut. Gen. Basilio Olara Okello, a Ugandan rebel leader who led a coup against the civilian Government of President Milton Obote in 1985, has died of diabetes complicated by malaria. He was 61 years old.
        His family did not say when he died. He had been living in exile in Khartoum for four years.
        General Okello was a major figure in the five-year civil war in Uganda that was ended by President Yoweri Museveni in 1986.
        He came up from the ranks of the army and fled to Tanzania after Idi Amin seized power and became dictator in 1971. He later was second in command of the force that toppled Mr. Amin in 1979.
