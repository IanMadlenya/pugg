        Dr. William J. Sweeney, a chemical engineer who retired as corporate research director of the Standard Oil Company (N.J.) in 1963 after 34 years with the concern, which is now the Exxon Corporation, died Wednesday at a nursing home in North Andover, Mass. He was 89 years old and lived in Summit, N.J.
        Dr. Sweeney, who held a doctorate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was a key figure in the development of high-octane aircraft fuel that powered Britain's Spitfire fighter planes to victory over Germany's bomber fleet in World War II. He was also instrumental in the production of synthetic lubricants required for jet engines, in both civilian and military aircraft, after the war.
        Dr. Sweeney, a native of Dorchester, Mass., joined Standard Oil in Baton Rouge, La., in 1929.
        In 1947, he was named a vice president of the Standard Oil Development Company, the central technical and research organization of Standard Oil.
        Dr. Sweeney is survived by his wife, the former Louise Clark; three sons, William Jr. of Concord, Mass., John, of Andover, Mass., and Robert, of Monte Carlo, Monaco; a brother, the Rev. Thomas, of Boston, and two granddaughters.
        A memorial Mass will be offered at St. Theresa's Roman Catholic Church in Summit at 10:30 A.M Thursday.
