        Munson Campbell, a former executive of two National Hockey League teams and a former advertising executive at The New York Times, died last Tuesday while on vacation in Barbados. He was 67 years old.
        He died after apparently suffering a heart attack, a family member said.
        Mr. Campbell was the president of Mark VII, a beer distribution company in Minneapolis. He had been the managing director of National Hockey League franchises from 1973 to 1982, first with the California Seals in Oakland, Calif., and then with the Colorado Rockies of Denver. The Rockies are now the New Jersey Devils.
        Mr. Campbell, who attended Yale University, began a career in the advertising department of The New York Times in 1947. He left The Times in 1965 to join the J. M. Mathes advertising agency in New York.
        His marriage to Joan Waugh ended in divorce. He is survived by two brothers, Douglas of New York and Stafford of Tampa, Fla.
