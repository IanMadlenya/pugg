        Robert Goldman, the winner of four world bridge titles, died of a heart attack on Sunday. He was 60 and lived in Highland Village, Tex.
        He died on the way to a Lewisville, Tex., hospital, said his stepdaughter, Renee DeSaye of Atlanta. He had just returned from a tournament in Boissier City, La.
        Mr. Goldman's four world titles were the Bermuda Bowl for Open Teams in 1970, 1971 and 1979 and the Mixed Teams in 1972. He was on the World Bridge Federation's list of Grand Masters, players of the highest rank.
        From 1968 to 1974, he was a member of the Aces team, which dominated the American tournament scene and had several epic battles with the  Italian Blue Team.
        He won 13 major national team titles: the Vanderbilt in 1971, 1973, 1978, 1997 and 1998; the Spingold in 1969, 1978, 1983, 1986 and 1988, and the Reisinger in 1970, 1976 and 1980. He finished second in three events 12 times. He also won seven other national titles and hundreds of regional titles, and ranked ninth on the all-time list of master point winners.
        For the last two years, he and Paul Soloway were the anchor pair in a series of Internet challenge matches.
        Mr. Goldman was named the American Contract Bridge League's Honorary Member for 1999, and is scheduled to be inducted into the league's Hall of Fame in San Antonio in July.
        His bridge activities were wide-ranging away from the card table. He taught classes, compiled computer practice hands and created a program to evaluate bidding probabilities. He wrote scripts for a bridge television series and two books, ''Aces Scientific'' (self-published, 1973) and ''Winners and Losers at the Bridge Table'' (Max Hardy,  1979).
        Mr. Goldman devised many conventions, notably Super Gerber and Exclusion Blackwood. He was a consultant to the bridge league in appeals, conventions and ethics.
        Mr. Goldman was born in Philadelphia and was the city high school tennis champion. While a student at Drexel University, he was captain of the basketball team that won the Mid-Atlantic Conference title in 1957-58 and set a scoring record.
        Other survivors are his wife, Bettianne; his son, Quinn; another stepdaughter, Cherri McKinstry of Dallas, and a stepson, Russel Taylor of Atlanta.
