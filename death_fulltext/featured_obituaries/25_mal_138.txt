        Frederick Weitzen, a bookseller who pioneered in mail-order techniques and who was a founder of the Marboro Books retail chain, died of lung cancer on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 77 years old. Mr. Weitzen, with Frank Bang and Henry Exstein, started Marboro in 1946 as a mail-order enterprise, advertising extensively to promote sales of popular books at low prices. The small-print advertisements, sometimes four newspaper pages long, summarized hundreds of books, many of them reprints and publishers' remainders.
        He was among the first retailers to sell artwork and posters in bookstores, starting the vogue in bullfight posters. He scored a particular success by acquiring 400,000 leftover catalogues for an exhibit of King Tutankhamen at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and selling them for $1 apiece.
        Born in Perth Amboy, N. J., he attended New York University and received a bachelor's degree from the Unviersity of Louisville. After serving as a sergeant in the United States Army during World War II, he became director of a camp for displaced persons in Germany run by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Agency.
        Mr. Weitzen is survived by his wife, the former Ellen May, and a son, Stephen, of Manhattan.
