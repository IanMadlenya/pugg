        Jonathan Woodner, a real estate developer and road racing driver, was killed Sunday in an airplane crash near Washington, where he lived. He was 44 years old.
        Mr. Woodner, who had been a licensed pilot for 20 years, competed in 12 to 15 rally road races annually in Europe. He was involved in car racing before joining his father's real estate company, the Jonathan Woodner Company, in 1974. His father, Ian, had named the Manhattan-based company after his son.
        The younger Mr. Woodner, who was born in Manhattan, ran the company's Washington interests and was president of the Ian Woodner Family Art Collection Foundation.
        Besides his father survivors include his mother, Ruth Lyon of Westport, Conn.; his longtime companion, Alison Zaremba; two sisters, Andrea of Manhattan and Diane Woodner Bamford of Santa Fe., N.M.; a half-sister, Sarah Jackson of Manhattan, and a half-brother, David Lyon of Westport.
