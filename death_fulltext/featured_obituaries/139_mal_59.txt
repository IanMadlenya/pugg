        Charles Roger Carlisle, a former official of GATT, died on July 26 at his home in Barnstable, Mass. He was 69.
        The cause of death was cancer, his wife, Nadeane, said.
        Mr. Carlisle served as the deputy director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade from 1987 to 1993. GATT, established in 1947, is a series of agreements on international commerce. Mr. Carlisle's tenure roughly coincided with the Uruguay Round, a series of international talks that resulted in the formation of the World Trade Organization in 1995. Before joining GATT, Mr. Carlisle was a Foreign Service officer, a corporate executive and a trade negotiator.
        Mr. Carlisle joined the Trade Agreements and Treaties division of the State Department in 1956. During his 14-year Foreign Service career, he served in several trade divisions, specializing in negotiations involving commodities. In 1970 and 1971, Mr. Carlisle represented the United States in the commodities division of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in Geneva.
        After he left the United Nations, Mr. Carlisle worked in the commodities industry in several capacities. He was chairman of the Lead-Zinc Producers Committee (1971-74) and the president of the American Fiber Manufacturers Association (1983-84), both industry trade groups. From 1974 to 1983, Mr. Carlisle was a vice president with St. Joe Minerals, a lead and zinc producer.
        In 1985, prior to joining GATT, Mr. Carlisle was appointed chief textile negotiator for the United States, a position that carried the rank of ambassador. After he left GATT in 1993, Mr. Carlisle formed Carlisle & Handal International with a colleague, Peter V. Handal. Carlisle & Handal is a consulting firm on trade and investment.
        Mr. Carlisle received a bachelor's degree from the University of Cincinnati in 1952, and a master's degree in public administration from Harvard University in 1962.
        He is survived by his wife, of Barnstable; a daughter, Leslie Nichols of Gainesville, Tex.; a son, John Howard of Barnstable, and two grandchildren.
