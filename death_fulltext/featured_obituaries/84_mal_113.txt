        Samuel M. Steward, a writer who was a friend of Gertrude Stein, died on Dec. 31 in Berkeley, Calif. He was 84 and lived in Berkeley.
        The cause, reported in The San Francisco Chronicle, was chronic pulmonary disease.
        Mr. Steward was born in Woodsfield, Ohio, and, after earning bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in English from Ohio State University, taught at several colleges and universities. He was an associate professor of English at Loyola University in Chicago from 1936 to 1946 and at DePaul University in Chicago from 1948 to 1954. From 1946 to 1948 he was an editor of the World Book Encyclopedia.
        In 1937 he met Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas in France. His friendship with them resulted in a memoir, "Dear Sammy: Letters From Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas" (1977), and two mysteries that cast Stein and Toklas as detectives, "Murder Is Murder Is Murder" (1985) and "The Caravaggio Shawl" (1989).
        He also wrote "Chapters From an Autobiography" (1981) and "Parisian Lives" (1984), a historical novel.
        After leaving academia in the mid-1950's, Mr. Steward made his living as a tattoo artist. Under the pen name Phil Andros, he also wrote gay erotica, beginning with "Stud" (1966).
        He is survived by his sister, Sarah Virginia Harper of Del Mar, Calif.
