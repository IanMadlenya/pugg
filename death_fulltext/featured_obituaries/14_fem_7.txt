        Miss Wilson sought fame in Hollywood after winning a 1915 statewide beauty contest in her native Alabama. After her arrival in Hollywood, she landed a small part in ''The Dumb Girl of Portici,'' which starred the ballerina Anna Pavlova. She went on to act in more than 100 silent and sound films over the next 33 years.
        Her best-known portrayals included Molly Wingate in ''The Covered Wagon'' and Daisy Buchanan in the 1926 version of ''The Great Gatsby.'' She acted opposite such leading men as Rudolph Valentino and John Gilbert.
        After retiring from motion pictures in 1941 - except for a bit part in the 1949 comedy ''The Girl From Jones Beach,'' starring Ronald Reagan -Miss Wilson turned to the Broadway stage and eventually television.
        ''The Guiding Light'' and ''The Edge of Night'' were among the network soap operas in which she played featured character roles.
        Although she never married, Miss Wilson was once described as cultivating a screen image of ''the soft, marrying kind of woman.'' Selected in 1924 by Paramount to represent the motion-picture industry at the British Empire Exposition, Miss Wilson was termed ''a typical example of the American girl in character, culture and beauty.''
        Miss Wilson was buried Monday at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, Calif., after a service at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills.
