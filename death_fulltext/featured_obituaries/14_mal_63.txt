        Robert Livingston, an actor who played the Lone Ranger and was in many Hollywood westerns, died Monday of emphysema at his home in Tarzana, Calif. He was 83 years old.
        Mr. Livingston appeared in more than 100 films between 1926 and 1975, including many silent-era slapstick comedies such as a series called ''The Collegians'' and a 29-film series of Westerns for Republic Pictures called ''The Three Mesquiteers.'' He played Zorro in ''The Bold Caballero'' (1936). His best-known role was in ''The Lone Ranger Rides Again'' (1939), when he became the only Lone Ranger ever to remove his mask. However, according to Samuel Sherman, his publicist, Mr. Livingston felt that his career was handicapped by his being typecast as a cowboy actor.
        His other films included ''Mutiny on the Bounty'' (1935), ''Pistol Packin' Mama'' (1943) and ''Once Upon a Horse'' (1958). He also appeared in plays and television shows. His last role was in ''Blazing Stewardesses'' (1975), a Western spoof.
        Mr. Livingston is survived by a son, Addison Randall of Tarzana.
