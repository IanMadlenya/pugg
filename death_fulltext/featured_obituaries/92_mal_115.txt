        William Gibberson, an actor and announcer, died on Saturday at St. Luke's/Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. He was 74.
        The cause was a stroke, said Nancy Lynch, his companion.
        Mr. Gibberson first appeared on Broadway in 1947 in "It Takes Two," produced by George Abbott. His other Broadway credits include "For Love or Money," "Two Blind Mice," "Mr. Barry's Etchings" and "The Heiress." He also toured in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" and "The King and I."
        On television, he was the announcer on Bishop Fulton J. Sheen's "Life Is Worth Living" and on "My Hero," a series that starred Robert Cummings.
        Mr. Gibberson was born in St. Louis on Dec. 27, 1919, and was a graduate of the University of Illinois. He served as assistant executive secretary of Actors Equity from 1960 to 1963 and also headed the union's industrial show department.
        He is survived by Ms. Lynch.
