        Ferdinand K. Platzer, a chef and restaurateur in New York and New Jersey, died yesterday at his home in Elberon, N.J., at the age of 68.
        His family said cancer was the cause.
        Mr. Platzer, known as Fred, opened several major Manhattan restaurants in the 1960's and 1970's as the chef director for the Brody Corporation, including Gallagher's Steak House, L'Etoile, the Museum of Modern Art dining room and the Ground Floor at CBS. He also reopened the Rainbow Room after a renovation.
        Later he shifted to New Jersey as the owner and operator of the Kings Court in Springfield, Old Orchard Inn in Eatontown, Le Pavillion in Wanamassa, the Essex and Sussex Hotel in Spring Lake and the Woodlake Country Club in Lakewood.
        As a chef, he specialized in European styles of cuisine and created recipes, including coconut fried shrimp and beer batter shrimp. Among his clients were Elizabeth Taylor, Jacqueline Onassis and Princess Grace of Monaco. Unlikely Outpost in Newark
        Mr. Platzer was born in Switzerland. He became an apprentice at the Hotel and Restaurant School in Lucerne. After coming to the United States, he directed the cooking at the Traymore and Ambassador hotels in Atlantic City.
        A chance meeting on a train with a Swiss-born restaurant executive landed Mr. Platzer the job as executive chef of the Newarker at Newark Airport. Despite its unassuming location, the Newarker was an outpost of culinary innovation. It operated as a kitchen laboratory for Restaurant Associates, a young company that spawned restaurant leaders like Joseph Baum, George Lang, Paul Kovi and Tom Margittai.
        Mr. Platzer is survived by his wife of 18 years, the former Valery Bennett; two sons, Ferdinand Jr. of Howell Township, N.J., and Robert, of Lakewood, N.J.; two daughters, Doris Marinaccio of Elberon, N.J., and Louise O'Malley of Little Silver, N.J.; a brother, Fritz, of Munchenstein, Switzerland, and seven grandchildren.
