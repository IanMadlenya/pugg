        Richard L. Gelb, the former chief executive of Bristol-Myers Squibb and a former director of The New York Times Company, died yesterday morning at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, his wife, Phyllis, said. He was 79 years old and lived on the Upper East Side.
        As chairman and chief executive of Bristol-Myers, Mr. Gelb presided over the company's merger with Squibb in 1989, creating what the company calls ''then the world's second-largest pharmaceutical enterprise.''
        Mr. Gelb also oversaw Bristol-Myers's 1967 decision to keep its headquarters in Manhattan at a time when other companies were moving to the suburbs. The company's headquarters is now at 345 Park Avenue.
        Mr. Gelb was born on June 8, 1924, in New York City to Lawrence M. Gelb and Joan Clair and received a bachelor of arts degree from Yale and a master's degree in business from Harvard. He served in the Army during World War II, then returned to New York and married Phyllis Nason in 1951.
        Mr. Gelb went to work for the cosmetics company founded by his parents, Clairol. Bristol-Myers acquired Clairol in 1959, and in 1972, he took over as chief executive of Bristol-Myers. He retired from his leadership posts at the company in the mid-90's but continued to be a consultant there, his wife said.
        Mr. Gelb was fascinated by police work, his wife said, and he helped to found the New York City Police Foundation, a fund-raising organization, with Mayor John V. Lindsay.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by four children, Lawrence Gelb, Lucy Sisto, Jane Gelb and James Gelb, and six grandchildren.
