        Patsy Nasher, who with her husband, Raymond, created one of the world's leading collections of modern sculpture, died of cancer on July 1 at the Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas. She was 59 years old. Mrs. Nasher, a friend of many of the artists whose work she collected, began by collecting pre-Columbian art, later becoming interested in Texas artists and 20th-century American painters and sculptors.
        Since the early 1970's, Mrs. Nasher had increasingly turned her interest toward the works for which the collection is now best known: modern sculpture by artists ranging from Picasso and Henry Moore to Giacometti, David Smith, Matisse and Maillol.
        A major exhibition of works from that collection, ''A Century of Modern Sculpture: The Patsy and Raymond Nasher Collection,'' opened at the Dallas Museum of Art in April 1987 and has since been shown at the National Gallery of Art in Washington and at the Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in Madrid. The show opened yesterday at the Forte di Belvedere in Florence.
        She is survived by her husband, Raymond, of Dallas; by her mother, Ivy Rabinowitz, of Dallas; by her daughters, Andrea, Joan and Nancy Nasher; by her sisters, Judy Tycher and Sandra Cohen, and by her brother, Stanley Randall.
