        Alfredo Leonardi, the founding administrator of the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research in Milan, Italy, died on Tuesday at Riunite Hospital in Bergamo, Italy. He was 66.
        The cause was myeloma, said Silvio Garattini, director of the institute.
        Dr. Leonardi, a native of Bologna, was a medical graduate of the University of Milan, where he then taught pharmacology and did research in chemotherapy for tumors. As a visiting researcher at the Pasteur Institute in Paris and the Serum Staten Institute in Copenhagen, he brought to Italy new culture techniques for growing human tumor cells in vitro for screening anti-tumor drugs.
        In the early 1960's he gave up his research to devote his time to the fledgling Mario Negri Institute. As the institute's secretary general from its founding until his death, Mr. Leonardi oversaw its day-to-day operations for more than three decades. As the staff grew to more than 900 people, the Milan institute added the Mario Negri Sud Consortium in Chieti, the Mario Negri Institute laboratories in Bergamo and the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Center in nearby Ranica.
        Mr. Leonardi is survived by two sisters, Irene Tortoreto of Milan and Anna Luisa Abbate of Florence.
