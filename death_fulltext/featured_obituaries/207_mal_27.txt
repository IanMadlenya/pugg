        John S. Crowley, a New York executive who was for a short time chairman of Channel 13 and ushered it through a time of financial distress, died on March 31 at the Good Samaritan Hospital in West Palm Beach, Fla. He was 80.
        The cause was complications from pneumonia and Parkinson's disease, said his son, Sean.
        From 1952 to 1977, Mr. Crowley was a member of McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm, where he eventually became a senior partner. After leaving McKinsey, he became an executive vice president of the Xerox Corporation.
        Mr. Crowley was on the board of several nonprofit organizations, including the American Foundation for the Blind, Helen Keller International and Channel 13, WNET, the New York metropolitan area's major public television station. In 1983, George T. Piercy, the chairman of Channel 13, stepped down as the station was facing a financial crisis. Mr. Crowley, who had been on the board for 17 years, became interim chairman for a year, pulling the station through a time of reorganization and deep budget cuts.
        John Schaft Crowley was born in Rochester on July 21, 1923. He graduated from the University of Rochester in 1943 and enlisted in the Navy. In 1946, he returned to Rochester, where he taught engineering classes at the university, leaving a year later to earn a master's degree in business administration from Harvard.
        Mr. Crowley is survived by his wife, Carol, of Greenwich, Conn.; his son, Sean, of Washington; his daughters, Megan Crowley-McAllister of Atlanta and Sheilah Crowley Knowlton and Katherine, both of New York; and five grandchildren.
