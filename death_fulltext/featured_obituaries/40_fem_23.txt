        Miss Nute began her career as curator of the Minnesota Historical Society's manuscript collection in 1921, after earning a Ph.D. in American history at Harvard University. She was among the first to use microfilm to preserve manuscripts and make them more accessible to scholars. From 1946 until her retirement in 1957, Dr. Nute was a research associate at the society.
        She wrote many books and articles about Minnesota fur traders and explorers, including ''The Voyageur'' and ''Caesars of the Wilderness.'' She was also a professor of history at Hamline University in St. Paul from 1927 to 1960 and a visiting professor at Macalester College.
        Her closest survivors are several nieces and nephews.
