        The Rev. John O. Mellin, a minister of the First Presbyterian Church in Greenwich Village from 1946 until he retired in 1989, died on Tuesday at the Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis, Mass. He was 75 and lived in Orleans, Mass.
        The cause was a stroke, said his wife, Gloria.
        In 1946, Mr. Mellin became assistant minister of the church, on Fifth Avenue at 12th Street. He became pastor in 1949 and, years later, co-pastor.
        He was instrumental in a 1960 decision by the General Assembly of the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. to endorse the view that ''peaceable and orderly civil disobedience'' was justified when laws favoring racial discrimination ''violate the law of God.'' The assembly's action was based on a report drawn up by its social education and action committee, headed by Mr. Mellin.
        The report was seen at the time as one of the strongest statements on racial relations to be approved by a major Protestant denomination.
        Mr. Mellin was also one of two leaders of a citizens' commission pressing the ultimately successful fight for the liberalization of New York State's divorce law. Before the law was changed, adultery was the only ground for divorce.
        Born in Manorville, Pa., he graduated in the early 1940's from the College of Wooster in Wooster, Ohio and then from Union Theological Seminary.
        Mr. Mellin was a trustee of Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan, a founder of Caring Community, a charitable organization in Greenwich Village, and president of the Association in Manhattan for Autistic Children.
        Besides his wife of almost 50 years, the former Gloria Rivers, he is survived by four sons, John Jr. and Peter of Orleans, James of Stamford, Conn., and Timothy of Lexington, Kentucky; and two grandsons.
