        Mr. Maltese was the oldest member of the Century Road Club Association. Incorporated in 1898, the organization is the oldest bicycle club in the United States.
        He organized the club's first 75-mile Apple Lap through the city in October 1979. The race included all five boroughs, starting in the Graniteville section of Staten Island and finishing about three hours later at the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Fifth Avenue.
        For 27 years he was the director of the national championships for the Amateur Bicycle League and organized Olympic qualification trials in Central Park in 1960, 1964, 1968 and 1972.
        He is survived by his wife, Frances; a son, Louis Jr., of Syosset, L.I.; a daughter, Anne Marie Chabuske, of East Islip, L.I., six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.
