        Donald Desmond Ashley, an advertising executive, died Wednesday at John Muir Hospital in Walnut Creek, Calif. He was 53 years old and lived in Moraga, Calif.
        He died of cancer, a family spokesman said.
        Mr. Ashley was chief operating officer and director of client services at Mandelbaum Mooney Ashley, a firm based in San Francisco that he joined in January 1989.
        He had previously been general manager of the 400-person Dallas office of the Tracy-Locke Agency for two years and general manager of Hal Riney and Partners in San Francisco for four years. He also spent 18 years with Ted Bates and Company in New York, and was a senior vice president when he left in 1983.
        He is survived by his wife, Patricia, and two daughters, Susan and Sharon, both college students.
