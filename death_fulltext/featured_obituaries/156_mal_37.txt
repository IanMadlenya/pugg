        David B. Bryson, a lawyer and advocate of the housing rights of poor people, died on Dec. 25 at a hospital in Berkeley, Calif. He was 58 and lived in Piedmont, Calif.
        The cause was lung cancer, The Associated Press said.
        Mr. Bryson ''was a central figure in the advocacy for public housing residents and residents of all subsidized housing developments,'' recalled another housing expert, Prof. Florence W. Roisman of the Indiana University School of Law in Indianapolis. ''He played a crucial role in developing housing legislation and regulations.''
        Mr. Bryson had been a staff lawyer, temporary director and deputy director for the National Housing Law Project in Oakland, Calif., and had worked with other similar groups for more than two decades.
        An authority on the complexities of federal housing programs, he taught many lawyers and other advocates about ways to provide legal support tailored to the needs of the poor.
        In an interview in September, he said, ''My job has really been about studying up on federal laws and conveying those ideas to the local legal services' attorneys and helping them understand what can be done for the very poorest people.''
        He was also involved in significant legal cases in his field, and he won honors from the National Legal Aide and Defender Association and other groups.
        David B. Bryson was born in Philadelphia and grew up in Westminster, Md. He received a bachelor's degree from Princeton University and a law degree from Columbia University.
        Surviving are his wife, Anita; a daughter, Hallie Ness of San Francisco; two sons, Paul, of Piedmont, and Ethan, of Bridgewater, N.J.; his parents, Mary and Brady Bryson of Westminster; a sister, Linda Lucatorto of Washington; and two brothers, John, of Washington, and Tim, of Westminster.
