        Virginia M. Satir, a leading family therapist, died of pancreatic cancer on Saturday. She was 72 years old.
        In her works, including ''Conjoint Family Therapy,'' published in 1964, ''Self-Esteem,'' ''Helping Families To Change'' and ''Meditations and Inspirations, '' she stressed the importance of individual self-worth and fought the notion that parents were to blame for their children's neuroses.
        She helped found the Mental Research Institute in Palo Alto in 1959 and founded the International Human Learning Resource Network 20 years later.
        She received her bachelor's degree in 1936 from the University of Wisconsin and a master's degree from the University of Chicago in 1948.
        Survivors include two daughters, Mary Harrell and Ruth Turpin, both of Long Beach; a sister, Edith Hardell of Morton Grove, Ill.; two brothers, Russel Pagenkopf of Carmichael, Calif., and Ray Pagenkopf of Alaska, and one granddaughter.
