        Leonard F. Schmitt, a lawyer who challenged Senator Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin in the 1952 Republican primary, at the height of Mr. McCarthy's anti-Communist campaign, died Thursday at the Good Samaritan Health Center in Merrill, Wis. He was 88 years old and lived in Merrill.
        He died of a heart attack, said his wife, Grace.
        Mr. Schmitt, who was soundly defeated by Senator McCarthy, had described his campaign as "a fight to retire from public office the most dangerous and irresponsible demagogue to despoil the political scene in many years." His candidacy brought him nationwide attention and hundreds of pieces of hate mail accusing him of being a Communist.
        In the primary Mr. McCarthy beat five Republicans and two Democrats combined by more than 100,000 votes.
        A liberal Republican, Mr. Schmitt was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1936. He served six years as District Attorney of Lincoln County in Wisconsin.
        He was a partner in the law firm of Schmitt, Hartley, Arndorfer & Koppelman until his death. He also served several years as president of the Marshall and Illsley Bank in Merrill.
        Mr. Schmitt, who was born on a farm in Marathon County, Wis., worked his way through the University of Wisconsin, barbering, playing baseball and doing odd jobs. He enlisted in the Army in 1942 as a private and was promoted to captain, serving at the Tank Destroyer School, Camp Hood, Tex., and overseas in Italy.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a brother, Anton of Schofield, Wis.
