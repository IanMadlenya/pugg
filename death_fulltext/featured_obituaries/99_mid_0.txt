        Eileen O'Casey, an actress and the author of three books about her husband, the playwright Sean O'Casey, died yesterday at Denville Hall, a theatrical retirement home in London. She was 95.
        The former Eileen Carey met O'Casey in Dublin when she auditioned for a role in his play "The Plough and the Stars" in 1926. The play caused an uproar because of its unsparing treatment of Dublin tenement life.
        The couple married in 1927, when he was 47 and she 27, and moved to Britain because of continuing problems surrounding the play. She gave up her acting career to raise their three children.
        In her books "Sean," "Eileen" and "Cheerio, Titan," written after O'Casey's death in 1964, she emphasized her husband's humanity. She had kept all of his love letters, including the last, from a month before his death, in which he wrote, "You are and have been, indeed, the pulse of my heart."
        The couple's younger son, Niall, died of leukemia in 1957. Surviving are a son, Breon, of Cornwall, England; a daughter, Shivaun, of Derry, Northern Ireland; four grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
