        Henry L. Goldberg, who began trading stocks on a street corner in 1913 and retired from active trading at the New York Stock Exchange just three years ago when he sold his brokerage firm, died on Tuesday at Beth Israel Medical Center. A resident of Manhattan, he was 92 years old -- the oldest member of the exchange.
        A native New Yorker, Mr. Goldberg opened his 75-year run on Broad Street as a poor boy. He left school at the age of 14 to support himself and his mother and became a junior trader on the Curb Market, an exchange that moved indoors in 1921 and eventually became the American Stock Exchange.
        The youth initially cleared $4 a week, of which he gave $1 to his mother. Observing his better-schooled peers, he succeeded in his chosen career and joined the Big Board in 1941 as a specialist, a role he continued in for almost half a century. His firm, H. L. Goldberg & Company was finally sold to Stern Brothers in 1988. Patron and Trustee
        In the intervening years, Mr. Goldberg did well enough to share his fortune as a philanthropist and patron of the arts. He was a trustee of Beth Israel Medical Center and the Phillips Beth Israel School of Nursing. He also financed biomedical research at Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa and was a board member and regent of the American Society for Technion.
        He was a member of the U.J.A.-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies and a supporter of other charitable organizations.
        He is survived by his wife, Viola Seff Goldberg; two stepdaughters, Victoria Seff Winteringham of New York and Kate Seff Beswick of London; two grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
        Correction:  September 7, 1991, Saturday
        An obituary yesterday about the oldest member of the New York Stock Exchange misidentified him in some copies. He was Henry L. Goldberg, not Harry Goldberg.
