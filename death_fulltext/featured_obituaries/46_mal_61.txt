        Jac Lessman, a hotel and resort planner and developer, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 85 years old.
        He died of a stroke, his family said.
        Mr. Lessman planned the renovation of several large Manhattan hotels in the 1960's, including the Hampshire House, the St. Moritz, the Biltmore, the Lincoln, the St. Regis, the Barclay and the Roosevelt. In the 1950's he planned several resort projects, including the Desert Inn in Las Vegas.
        Mr. Lessman, who was born in Chicago, began his career there in 1924 with the development of the Hotel Duluth. Four years later he moved to New York, where he furnished and decorated a number of hotels, including the Delmonico, and formed a consulting group, the Lessman Organization.
        Among his clients were Henry K. Kaiser, the industrialist, for whom he planned the Kaiser Permanente hospitals on the West Coast and resort developments in Hawaii. In 1950 he negotiated the sale of the Hotel Nacional in Havana, which he had built for a group of United States investors only weeks before Fidel Castro's revolution.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Hope Miller, and a stepson, Lance, of Manattan.
