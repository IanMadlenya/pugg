        Rabbi Philip Paretzky, a professor of Talmud at the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary in Manhattan and a member of the faculty there since 1963, died on Sunday at his home in the Bronx. He was 75 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, according to Sam Hartstein, a spokesman for the seminary.
        Rabbi Paretzky was also the official bochen, or examiner of prospective rabbinical candidates, at the seminary, which is an affiliate of Yeshiva University.
        In addition to his work at the seminary, Rabbi Paretzky served for more than 25 years as the head of the Young Israel Synagogue of Tremont in the Bronx. He was a member of the Rabbinical Council of America and the Union of Orthodox Rabbis of the United States and Canada.
        Rabbi Paretzky, who was born in Poland in 1917, was ordained there and then came to the United States where he earned a master's degree in Semitics from Columbia and a law degree from Fordham.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Yehudit Manber; a daughter, Paulette Mandelbaum; three sons, Rabbi Koppel, Rabbi Israel and Zev, all of New York City, and several grandchildren.
