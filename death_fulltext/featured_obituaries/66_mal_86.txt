        Hans Falkenburg, the retired head of an advertising art studio and a philanthropist, died on Thursday at Mount Vernon Hospital in Mount Vernon, N.Y. He was 89 years old and lived in Eastchester, N.Y.
        He died of pneumonia and cardiac disease, his family said.
        Born in Berlin, Mr. Falkenburg, who was Jewish, fled Germany shortly before World War II. He and his wife and daughter came to New York City, where he worked days and took night courses at Hunter College.
        He rose from office boy to president in his 50-year career at the Hanley Studio, a Manhattan company that produced graphic art for print advertising. Its clients included Colgate, A.&P., and Mobil. He retired as president and became board chairman five years ago.
        Among the organizations he contributed to were the Boys Club, Macabee, B'Nai B'rith, United Jewish Appeal, Metropolitan Opera and New York Settlement House.
        His wife of 54 years, the former Gertrud Enders, died in 1983.
        He is survived by a daughter, Anneliese Vogel of Mount Vernon; a brother, Ernst Falkenburg of Miami, Fla., and a grandson.
