        Charles Langford, a civil rights lawyer whose best-known client was a Montgomery, Ala., seamstress named Rosa Parks, died on Feb. 11 at his home in Montgomery. He was 84. Mr. Langford died in his sleep, his niece Audrey Anderson told The Associated Press.
        A Democrat, Mr. Langford was prominent in Alabama politics, serving five terms in the State Senate before retiring in 2002. He had previously been in the State House of Representatives.
        With Fred D. Gray, Mr. Langford represented Mrs. Parks after she was arrested on Dec. 1, 1955, for refusing to relinquish her seat to a white passenger on a bus in Montgomery. According to news reports of the period, Mr. Gray and Mr. Langford were the only two black lawyers in Montgomery.
        In response to Mrs. Parks's arrest, blacks boycotted city buses for more than a year, as legal challenges to Jim Crow laws in Montgomery were mounted. On Nov. 13, 1956, ruling in another Montgomery case, Browder v. Gayle, the United States Supreme Court affirmed a district court's ruling outlawing segregation on the city buses.
        Charles Douglas Langford was born on Dec. 9, 1922, in Montgomery. He received a bachelor's degree from Tennessee State University and a law degree from the Catholic University of America.
        Among Mr. Langford's other clients was Arlam Carr Jr., whose suit in 1964 desegregated Montgomery public schools. In 1993, representing a group of black legislators, Mr. Langford helped end the flying of a Confederate battle flag from the dome of the State Capitol in Montgomery.
        Surviving is a sister, Mattie Lee Langford, of Montgomery. Information on other survivors could not be confirmed.
