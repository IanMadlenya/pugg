        Dr. Roy Lubove, a social historian and author of seven books in that field, died on Feb. 17 at Montefiore Hospital in Pittsburgh. He was 60 and lived in Pittsburgh.
        The cause was respiratory failure, said Prof. Arden Meltzer, a colleague at the University of Pittsburgh.
        At his death, Dr. Lubove was professor of history and social studies in the university's department of social work with a joint appointment in the department of history. He joined the faculty as a professor in 1963, after three years as an instructor and research fellow in the history department at Harvard University.
        Most of his widely cited social histories remain in print, including "The Struggle for Social Security, 1900-1935" (Harvard University Press, 1968, University of Pittsburgh Press, 1986). Another landmark publication was "The Professional Altruist: The Emergence of Social Work as a Career, 1880-1930" (Harvard, 1968).
        He wrote "Twentieth Century Pittsburgh, Vol. 1: Government, Business and Change" (Pittsburgh, 1969; rev. ed. 1994). The second volume, "The Post-Steel Era," will be published by University of Pittsburgh Press this fall.
        Dr. Lubove was born in Jackson Heights, Queens, and graduated from Columbia College in 1956. He earned his doctorate at Cornell University in 1960, and joined the faculty at Harvard that year.
        He was the author of many articles and edited numerous books, including Jacob Riis's "The Making of an American" (Harper & Row, 1966).
        He was active in community groups and was a founding director of Preservation Pittsburgh, an organization dedicated to the preservation of historic structures in and around the city.
        Dr. Lubove is survived by a daughter, Rebecca E. Lubove of Basking Ridge, N.J.; a son, Seth H., of Los Angeles, and one grandson.
