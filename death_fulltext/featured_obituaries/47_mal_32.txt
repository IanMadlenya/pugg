        Michael J. Brody, a professor of pharmacology at the University of Iowa who was an expert on hypertension, died Monday near Cairns, Australia, where he was attending a conference on high blood pressure. He was 56 years old and lived in Iowa City, Iowa.
        The cause of death has not been determined, a spokeswoman for the university said.
        Mr. Brody was a graduate of the Bronx High School of Science, Columbia University and the University of Michigan, where he earned a Ph.D. in 1961. Dr. Brody was also head of the Specialized Center for Research in Hypertension at the University of Iowa and associate director of the Cardiovascular Center there.
        He was known for his work in showing the role played by the central nervous system in the development of hypertension. He was the recipient of many awards, including the 1990 Ciba Award for Hypertension Research.
        He is survived by his wife, Natalie; two daughters, Ellen of Manhattan and Deborah of Alexandria, Va; his mother, Ethel, and a brother, Saul, both of Manhattan.
