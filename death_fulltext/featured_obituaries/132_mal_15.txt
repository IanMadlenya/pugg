        Francisco Rodrigo, one of the old-time campaigners against the dictatorship of Ferdinand E. Marcos, died on Sunday after decades of unbending dissidence, a Philippine newspaper reported today. He was 83.
        He died of complications from pneumonia, according to The Philippine Star, for which he still wrote a column.
        A politician, polemicist and poet, Mr. Rodrigo was known by the nickname Soc -- short for Socrates -- for his eloquence in debate.
        A former Senator, Mr. Rodrigo was jailed three times by Mr. Marcos. But he continued attacking the former President in opposition newspapers until Mr. Marcos fled the country in 1986 after the ''people power'' uprising that brought Corazon C. Aquino to the presidency.
        A funeral service on Wednesday is to be led by Jaime Cardinal Sin, who helped lead that uprising. Mr. Rodrigo is survived by his wife, Remedios, and six children.
        Mr. Rodrigo was trained as a lawyer and served in the Philippine Senate from 1955 to 1967, where he was known for his elaborate oratory in classical Tagalog, the primary language of the Philippines, and for his outspokenness.
        When Mr. Marcos declared martial law in 1972, Mr. Rodrigo was one of the first opponents to be arrested and jailed, along with Mrs. Aquino's husband, Benigno, who was assassinated in 1983.
        Mr. Rodrigo was arrested a second time in 1978 for his participation in opposition rallies. His third arrest was in 1982 when Mr. Marcos shut down the opposition newspaper We Forum, for which Mr. Rodrigo wrote an acerbic column, sometimes in verse.
        ''He was one of the old-style Philippine politicians,'' a young Filipino journalist said today. ''I remember his language the most. Nobody speaks or writes like that anymore.''
