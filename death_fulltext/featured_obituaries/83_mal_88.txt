        Gordon C. Griswold Sr., who rose from a cadet engineer to board chairman in his 42 years at the Brooklyn Union Gas Company, died on Tuesday at a retirement community in Kalamazoo, Mich. He was 83 and had moved there from Westfield, N.J., in 1987.
        The cause of death was congestive heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Griswold, a native of Denver, was a 1933 economics graduate of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. He joined Brooklyn Union that year, was elected a vice president in 1961, executive vice president and a director in 1961, president in 1968, and chairman and chief executive in 1974, the year before his retirement.
        For many years he was a leader in the business community and in civic organizations in Brooklyn and Westfield. In 1974 he received the Gold Medal Award for distinguished service to Brooklyn from the Downtown Brooklyn Development Association, having served as its chairman in 1972. Earlier he served as president and a director of the Downtown Brooklyn Association.
        He was a director of the United Hospital Fund of New York and president of the United Fund (United Way) of Westfield. He also was a past member of the Scotch Plains School Board.
        His first wife, Emily, died in 1981. He is survived by his wife, Esther; three sons, Gordon C. Jr., of Westfield, John R., of Bethlehem, Pa., and Alan R., of Knoxville, Tenn.; a sister, Barbara Bishop of Shelburne Falls, Mass.; eight grandchildren and one great-grandson.
