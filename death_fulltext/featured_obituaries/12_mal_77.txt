        Sam Raphling, a composer and pianist, died Friday of heart failure. He was 78 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Raphling was born in Fort Worth on March 19, 1910, and studied in Chicago and Germany. He was active for many years as a composer, teacher and pianist in Chicago, and also taught for a time at the Greenwich House Music School in New York. His compositions included works in many genres, including a ''Cowboy Rhapsody'' for violin and orchestra, an ''Introduction and Workout'' for French Horn, and a short chamber opera, ''Mrs. Bullfrog,'' based on a story by Nathaniel Hawthorne.
        He also made a virtuoso piano transcription of Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring'' that attracted considerable attention when it was played and recorded by Dickran Atamian. Peter G. Davis wrote in The New York Times that ''Mr. Raphling's edition would undoubtedly have won the approval of Liszt himself - he has made an amazing amount of the score's complex rhythmic, harmonic and contrapuntal detail available to 10 agile fingers.''
