        Kenneth Auchincloss, a veteran writer and later a top editor at Newsweek, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 65.
        The cause was complications of liver cancer, said Richard Smith, chairman and editor in chief of Newsweek.
        Mr. Auchincloss joined Newsweek in 1966 as a writer for the international section of the United States edition and moved to the national affairs department, where he rose to senior editor. He was executive editor of Newsweek's United States edition from 1973 to 1975 before being named managing editor in 1975.
        Mr. Auchincloss was managing editor from 1975 to 1996, under several editors in chief. From 1986 to 1995, he was also editor of Newsweek International, directing the magazine's three overseas English-language editions. He was named editor at large in 1996. He formally retired a year ago but returned to edit special editions until a few months ago.
        He was born in Manhattan on July 3, 1937. His father was an editor at Time magazine. His grandfather, James C. Auchincloss, was a United States representative from New Jersey. A distant uncle was Hugh D. Auchincloss, stepfather of Jacqueline Onassis. His brother David was publisher of Newsweek and Atlantic Monthly. Louis Auchincloss, the writer, was a cousin.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Eleanor Johnson; a daughter, Emily; and a son, Malcolm, all of Manhattan.
        Mr. Auchincloss was a page in the United States Congress when he was 12. He graduated from the Groton School, Harvard and Balliol College of Oxford University. He worked in the Commerce Department and for the president's special representative for trade negotiations in the Kennedy administration. Before joining Newsweek, he had a job at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton in 1965 and 1966.
