        Peter J. Camiel, who headed Philadelphia's Democratic Party in the 1970's, died Thursday at Fatlands, his estate in Valley Forge, Pa. He celebrated his 81st birthday on Tuesday.
        He died of lung cancer, said his physician, Dr. Stewart Foreman. Mr. Camiel, a smoker of three packages of cigarettes a day, had undergone several operations in the last few years.
        Mr. Camiel was chairman of the Democratic City Committee in Philadelphia from 1970 to 1976. He began his political career in 1936 as a ward leader for the Democrats in a city then dominated by a Republican machine.
        In 1952, by which time Mr. Camiel had become a millionaire as a wholesale beer distributor, he upset a popular Republican, John Meade, to win a seat in the State Senate, where he served three terms.
        His tenure as party leader was marked by a running feud with Mayor Frank L. Rizzo, whom he helped to elect in 1971. But soon afterward the two became bitter opponents.
        Ousted from his citywide leadership post by Mayor Rizzo, Mr. Camiel nevertheless remained active in city politics until his death. He was the Democratic leader of the Fifth Ward, known as Center City, a position he held for more than 40 years.
        In 1980 Mr. Camiel and three other politicians were convicted on Federal charges of fraud growing out of a scheme in which prosecutors said people who did little or no work were on the state payroll.The verdict was overturned on appeal.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Nina Gumen; two sons, Peter J. Jr. and Valentine Richard, and a daughter, Nina Owens, all of Philadelphia; two brothers, Edwin and Joseph, and a sister, Laura Tereshsko, all of Philadelphia, and a grandson.
