        Emmett Colvin, a criminal defense lawyer from Texas, died on April 2 at his home in Fairfax, Va. He was 80 and had retired to Virginia from Dallas three years ago.
        The cause of death was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Colvin was among the lawyers who represented Jack Ruby in an appeal of his murder conviction for shooting Lee Harvey Oswald, the assassin of President John F. Kennedy. They successfully argued for Ruby's right to a new trial, but Ruby died of cancer before it could be held.
        Mr. Colvin practiced criminal law defense for more than 50 years, mostly in Texas. He argued several cases before the United States Supreme Court and for two years was dean of the National College of Criminal Defense, a post-graduate school for practicing lawyers.
        He was educated at Arkansas State University and St. Louis University and received a law degree from the University of Arkansas in 1941.
        Mr. Colvin is survived by his wife of 57 years, Mary Lee Colvin; two sons, Lance, of Seattle, and Mark, of Fairfax; a daughter, Laurel Colvin of Chappaqua, N.Y.; six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
