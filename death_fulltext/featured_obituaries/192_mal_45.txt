        Donald Karshan, a print collector, writer on the graphic arts and former director of the New York Cultural Center on Columbus Circle, died on Jan. 4 in Tampa, Fla. He was 73 and lived in Port Orange, Fla., where he moved from Manhattan in 1985.
        The cause was Alzheimer's disease, his family said.
        Mr. Karshan, who was born in Brooklyn, studied at the Arts Student League and began to collect in the early 1960's. In 1964 he incorporated the Museum of Graphic Arts.
        Its purpose was to make available to the public prints kept in private collections or in museum storage bins. Exhibitions of such art were held at his museum on West 19th Street in Manhattan.
        He became the founding director of the New York Cultural Center in association with Fairleigh Dickinson University when it took over the Huntington Hartford Collection at 2 Columbus Circle.
        The center opened formally in 1971. He supervised several exhibitions but left after a year, saying he wanted to devote his time to writing. The center closed in 1975; last summer plans were announced to recycle it into the Museum of Contemporary Arts and Design (formerly the American Craft Museum).
        Mr. Karshan was the curator of the estate and archive of the Russian-born sculptor Alexander Archipenko. More recently he organized exhibitions for the Museum of Arts and Sciences in Daytona Beach, Fla.
        He was a former prints editor of Art in America magazine and contributed articles and criticism to other publications. He was the author of books on prints and ceramics as well as of ''Archipenko: Themes and Variations, 1908-1963'' (1989).
        Mr. Karshan is survived by his wife, Maurie; three sons, Shane, of San Francisco; Gregory, of Naples; and Alexander, of Rome; two daughters, Andrea, of Daytona Beach, and Michelle, of Port-au-Prince, Haiti; and six grandchildren.
