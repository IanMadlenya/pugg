        Ferdinando Scarfiotti, who won an Academy Award in 1988 for the art direction of Bernardo Bertolucci's film "The Last Emperor," died on Saturday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 53.
        The cause was liver failure, said Henry Penner, a spokesman.
        "He was a major force in contemporary film design, and influenced an entire generation of directors and designers," said the director Paul Schrader, who worked with Mr. Scarfiotti on "American Gigolo."
        Mr. Scarfiotti, known as Nando, was also nominated for an Academy Award for the art direction of "Toys," the 1992 film directed by Barry Levinson. Mr. Scarfiotti's Oscar was among nine won by "The Last Emperor," a visually stunning epic largely filmed in China. His first collaboration with Mr. Bertolucci was in 1969 on "The Conformist." He was also the art director for Mr. Bertolucci's "Last Tango in Paris" (1973).
        He was born in Potenza Picena, Italy, and was trained as an architect. The director Luchino Visconti encouraged him to become a production designer. In 1971, Mr. Scarfiotti won a British Academy Award as the art director for Mr. Visconti's "Death in Venice."
        Mr. Scarfiotti is survived by his mother, Luisa Scarfiotti; a brother, Emanuele Scarfiotti, and a sister, Giovanna DeVergottini, all of Rome.
