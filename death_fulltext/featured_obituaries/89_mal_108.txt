        Jack Harkness, a British grower and breeder of roses and an author, died on June 18. He was 75 and lived in Southwold, England.
        In his long career, Mr. Harkness introduced roses with names that were sometimes romantic, like "Compassion," "Yesterday" and "Amber Queen," sometimes exotic, like "Tigris" and "Euphrates," and sometimes aristocratic, like "Mountbatten."
        He was born into a family that began raising roses in the 19th century. He worked for the family's rose-growing firm, R. Harkness & Company, in Hertfordshire, from 1937 to 1977, with time out for army service in World War II.
        In the early 1960's, he began cross-breeding roses. He went on to win a medal in Rome and a prize in Paris for a red-and-white shrub rose named Marjorie Fair. Its admirers have called it spectacular. Other awards for his breeding work, which was in association with Alec Cocker, came from the United States and Australia.
        The titles Mr. Harkness gave his several books also varied in tone, from the brisk "Growing Roses" (1967) to the dreamy "The Makers of Heavenly Roses" (1985).
        He is survived by his wife, Betty, a daughter and two sons.
