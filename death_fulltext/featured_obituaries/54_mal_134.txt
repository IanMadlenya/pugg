        Jasper F. Frand, a senior vice president of Helmsley-Spear Inc., a Manhattan real-estate concern, died on Tuesday at his home in Scarsdale, N.Y. He was 70 years old.
        He died of cancer, a family spokesman said.
        Mr. Frand joined Helmsley-Spear in 1947 and was with the company at his death. He also taught courses in real estate at the City College of New York for 17 years and at Cornell University for 10.
        He was a first lieutenant in the Army's 20th Air Force in the Pacific in World War II, flying 31 missions in a combat crew as a navigator-bombardier. He was twice awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, as well as the Air Medal with three Oak Leaf clusters.
        Mr. Frand, who was a native of Brooklyn, graduated from City College in 1952.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Lucille Spigel; three daughters, Deni and Nina, both of Manhattan, and Erica, of Los Angeles, and seven grandchildren.
