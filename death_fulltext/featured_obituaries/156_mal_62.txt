        James P. O'Neil, the president and chief operating officer of Browne & Company, believed to be the country's second-oldest publicly traded company and one of the world's leading financial printers, died on Thursday in New York City. He was 55 and lived in Wayne, N.J.
        He died of cardiac arrest at St. Vincents Hospital and Medical Center, said Denise K. Fletcher, a senior vice president and chief financial officer of the company.
        Browne & Company specializes in printing documents for initial public offerings, mergers and acquisitions and other forms required by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Its revenues rose to $850 million from $110 million during Mr. O'Neil's tenure, Ms. Fletcher said.
        Mr. O'Neil joined the company in 1984 as chief financial officer. In 1996, he became president and chief operating officer.
        Founded in 1775 in New York, Browne & Company has offices in 51 cities in 12 countries. It has about 7,000 employees.
        Before joining Browne, Mr. O'Neil was a partner at J. H. Cohn & Company, an accounting firm.
        James Peter O'Neil was born in Glen Ridge, N.J., on Dec. 8, 1944. He received a bachelor of science degree in business administration from Seton Hall University in South Orange, N.J., in 1966. For the next two years, he served in the United States Army; he was awarded a Silver Star during his tour of duty in Vietnam.
        Mr. O'Neil is survived by his wife, JoAnne; a son, James J. O'Neil of Queens; two daughters, Pamela Fauerbach of Little Falls, N.J., and Kathleen O'Neil of Wayne; two brothers, Robert, of Neshanic Station, N.J., and Jack, of Norfolk, Va.; and a sister, Peggy.
        Correction:  January 16, 2000, Sunday  An obituary yesterday about James P. O'Neil, president and chief operating officer of a worldwide financial printing company founded in 1775 in New York, misspelled its name. It is Bowne & Company, not Browne.
