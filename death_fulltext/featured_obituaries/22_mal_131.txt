        Edward Lund, the last surviving crew member of Howard Hughes's airplane flight around the world in 1938, died Sunday at Hoag Memorial Hospital here. He was 82 years old.
        Mr. Lund, who met Mr. Hughes while welding model airplanes for a Hughes film, ''Hell's Angels,'' was co-pilot on the 1938 flight. The crew, which also included Mr. Hughes and three others, took off from Floyd Bennett Field in New York in a Lockheed Model 14 on July 10, 1938, and returned July 14, setting a record time for a round-the-world flight of 3 days 19 hours 17 minutes.
        Mr. Lund owned an airplane parts supply company in New York in the 1950's before retiring in 1960.
        Survivors include a daughter, Delores Tippo.
