        William H. Short, an architect who supervised the construction of the Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan and the restoration of Drumthwacket, the governor's mansion in New Jersey, died on Wednesday at the Medical Center at Princeton, N.J. He was 66 years old and lived in Princeton.
        He died of cancer, a family spokesman said.
        He was a founding partner in 1974 of Short and Ford and Partners, an architectural firm that is one of the leading historic preservation organizations in the country.
        Mr. Short, a Princeton University graduate, began his career in Manhattan with Holden, McLaughlin Associates and was chosen by Frank Lloyd Wright to supervise construction of the Guggenheim Museum from 1956 to 1960. He went on to a partnership with Robert Venturi of Philadelphia. In the early 1980's he guided restoration of the governor's mansion in Princeton.
        At his death, he was one of two advisers from New Jersey to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. He was also chairman of the New Jersey Society of Architects Historic Resources and Preservation Committee and a trustee of the New Jersey Historical Society and the Historical Society of Princeton.
        He is survived by a brother, Winthrop, of Princeton. His companion was Derrill I. McGuigan.
