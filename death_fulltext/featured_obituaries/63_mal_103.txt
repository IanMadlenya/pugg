        Rear Adm. William J. Whiteside, who ferried Allied units across the Rhine in 1945 and then followed Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, his Commander-in-Chief, to Columbia University to manage its physical upkeep, died on Monday in a nursing home outside London. He was 90 years old.
        He died after a lengthy illness, his family said.
        A native of Brooklyn, Admiral Whiteside graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1926 and from the University of California at Berkeley with a master's in engineering in 1935. He served in the Mediterranean Fleet during the Spanish Civil War and spent a year on "neutrality patrol" in the South Atlantic just before the United States entered World War II.
        He was sent to England for the preparations of the invasion of France, in June 1944, and while in Britain, he was temporarily assigned to the United States Army to take command of British and American vessels involved in the crossing of the Rhine, in March 1945. He won American, British, French and Belgian decorations for his conduct in both efforts.
        Admiral Whiteside retired from the Navy in 1947. He accepted the position of assistant Director of Buildings and Grounds at Columbia University, where General Eisenhower had just become President in 1948. He became director in 1953.
        Admiral Whiteside ran the Morningside campus and off-campus sites, like the Lamont-Dougherty Geological Laboratories, with military efficiency.
        When he retired in 1969, Columbia's trustees cited the "intelligent, calm and courageous leadership" which he had displayed in student revolt of 1968 and other challenges.
        Admiral Whiteside is survived by a daughter, Patricia Whiteside, of London, and three grandchildren.
