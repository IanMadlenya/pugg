        Mr. Mills, a founding partner of Sherwood, Mills & Smith, an architectural firm in Stamford, Conn., designed the St. Mark's Episcopal Church in New Canaan, Conn., the Burndy Library in Norwalk, Conn., an addition to St. Christopher's Episcopal Church in Chatham and numerous college buildings.
        A native of Menominee, Mich., Mr. Mills received a bachelor's degree in architecture from the University of Pennsylvania in 1929. He then worked for several architecture firms in New York City.
