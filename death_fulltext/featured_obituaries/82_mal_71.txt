        H. Gates Lloyd, a Philadelphia investment banker who also served for 10 years as a deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency, died Thursday at his home in Haverford, Pa. He was 92.
        The cause of death was a stroke, said a son, Wingate Lloyd.
        Mr. Lloyd joined the C.I.A. in 1950, and in 1954 he was appointed the deputy director of administration, a position he held until his retirement from the agency in 1964.
        After graduating from Princeton University in 1923, Mr. Lloyd joined Drexel & Company, the Philadelphia investment bank. In 1927 he became a partner in the firm, which was the predecessor of Drexel Burnham Lambert.
        Mr. Lloyd is survived by two sons, J. Gates Lloyd 3d of Philadelphia, and Wingate Lloyd of Washington; two daughters, Mary L. Robb of Rosemont, Pa., and Prudence L. Rosenthal of Ann Arbor, Mich.; 18 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.
