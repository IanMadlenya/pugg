        Elizabeth D. Eden, whose desire for a sex-change operation led to an attempted bank robbery portrayed in the film ''Dog Day Afternoon,'' died of pneumonia resulting from AIDS Tuesday at Genesee Hospital in Rochester. She was 41 years old and lived in Rochester.
        Ms. Eden, formerly Ernest Aron, and the robbery attempt were the basis for the 1975 movie starring Al Pacino.
        In 1972 Ms. Eden's boyfriend, John Wojtowicz, held seven Chase Manhattan Bank employees hostage for 14 hours during the robbery attempt in Brooklyn. He was arrested at Kennedy International Airport as he tried to commandeer an airplane to escape with the hostages.
        Ms. Eden was born in Ozone Park, Queens.
        After the failed bank robbery, Mr. Wojtowicz served seven years in prison and additional time for parole violations. He was released last April.
        Ms. Eden's sex change was financed with part of Mr. Wojtowicz's share of the proceeds from the film.
