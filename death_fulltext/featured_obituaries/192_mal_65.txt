        Mr. Pachetti was president and chairman of the RAI Corporation, the American subsidiary of Italy's public broadcasting system, from 1970 to 1993. He came to the United States first in 1955 to cover a visit of the Italian president and returned in the early 1960's as RAI correspondent at the United Nations.
        He was chairman of the academy, an affiliate of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, from 1977 to 1993. It represents broadcasters from more than 50 countries, and awards Emmys for television programs produced abroad.
        Renato Pachetti was born in Massa Carrara, Tuscany. He earned a degree in pharmaceutical chemistry from the University of Modena in 1950. He became news editor of RAI-Radio-TV Italiana in Rome and then director of RAI radio programming before settling permanently in New York in 1970.
        He was a past chairman of the Foreign Press Association of the United States and president of Gruppo Esponenti Italiani, an association of Italian business leaders in this country.
        Mr. Pachetti is survived by his wife of 37 years, the former Diane Finney; three sons, Alessandro, Niccolo and Edward, all of Manhattan; and a granddaughter.
