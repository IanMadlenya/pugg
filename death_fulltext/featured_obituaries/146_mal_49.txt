        Andre Gilbert Ernotte, a playwright, filmmaker and director of stage, television and opera productions in New York and Europe, died on March 8 at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 55 and lived in Manhattan.
        He had liver disease and died of heart failure while awaiting a liver transplant, said Elliot Tiber, his companion and the author with Mr. Ernotte of the 1982 play ''The Music Keeper,'' which recently opened in Italy.
        Mr. Ernotte, a native of Liege, Belgium, tackled offbeat and surreal subjects Off Broadway as well as more traditional fare. He began to make his mark in New York in the 1970's, and since then he has lived in both the United States and Europe.
        He directed performances at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Manhattan Theater Club, Playwrights Horizons, South Street Theater, Ubu Repertory Theater, Improv Theater, the Joseph Papp Public Theater, New York Shakespeare Festival, Stratford Shakespeare Theater, Kennedy Center and the Royal Opera House in London.
        He was engaged in a production at the McCarter Theater in Princeton, N.J., when he became ill.
        In the 1990's he became a mainstay of the Vineyard Theater and Workshop Center in lower Manhattan. There he directed 13 productions, notably Polly Pen's ''Christina Alberta's Father,'' which earned him an Obie Award in 1994.
        Besides Mr. Tiber, he is survived by two sisters, both of Belgium.
