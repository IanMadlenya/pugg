        Robert M. Kossick, chairman and chief executive officer of the National Community Bank of New Jersey, died on Tuesday at his home in Ridgewood, N.J. He was 53 years old and also had a home in Tuxedo Park, N.Y.
        The cause was a heart attack, the bank's announcement said.
        A native of New Brunswick, N.J., Mr. Kossick was an industrial-engineering graduate of the Georgia Institute of Technology and earned a master's degree in economics at St. Mary's University in San Antonio. After two years of service in the Air Force there, he started out as a systems engineer with the E.I. DuPont Company in Parkersburg, W. Va.
        His banking career began in 1968 with Citicorp in New York. In the next seven years he worked in domestic and overseas departments with increasing responsibilities. His final position was in London as senior operating officer of the Citibank UK Retail Bank.
        He then became executive vice president of the Bank of the Southwest in Houston and, in 1979, chairman and chief executive of Empire National Bank in New City, N.Y. The following year he joined National Community Bank as president and chief executive at its headquarters in West Paterson. He traded the presidency for the chairmanship five years ago.
        During his tenure, the bank quadrupled its assets to $4.2 billion and grew from 49 to 117 branches, with nearly 2,900 employees statewide. Most recently, he negotiated the bank's pending merger with the Bank of New York.
        He was a sought-after speaker for free enterprise. James Peters, the bank's current president, said with his death the "industry lost one of its most successful and colorful leaders."
        Mr. Kossick is survived by his wife, the former Sherry Lynne Stamey, of Houston; two sons, Robert and Mark; and two daughters, Kristen and Alicia.
