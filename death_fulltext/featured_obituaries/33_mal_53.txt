        Henrik Kurt Carlsen, a sea captain who gained international attention in 1952 for staying stubbornly aboard his crippled freighter for seven days as she slowly sank, died Saturday at his home in Woodbridge. He was 75 years old.
        Captain Carlsen, then the captain of the freighter Flying Enterprise, ordered the 40 crew members and 10 passengers overboard on Dec. 29, 1951, after a storm ripped open the ship's hull in the English Channel. He remained with the ship, owned by American Export-Isbrandtsen Lines, so the vessel could not be claimed for salvage by another company.
        Although Captain Carlsen spent most of the seven-day ordeal alone, he was joined on the last day by the mate of an English tugboat that had come to the rescue. On Jan. 5, 1952, as another storm began to threaten the ship, Captain Carlsen and his companion jumped overboard and watched from the tug's deck as the ship sank into the Channel near Falmouth.
        For his heroism, Captain Carlsen was awarded the Merchant Marine Distinguished Service Award, authorized by a special act of Congress.
        Born in Denmark, he came to United States in 1938, settling on Staten Island and later moving to Woodbridge. He worked for the shipping line from 1944 until retiring in 1976.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Agnes Sorensen; two daughters, Sonia Carlsen Fedak and Karen Carlsen Mueller, both of whom live in Michigan; a sister, Grete Steinert, who lives in Denmark, and three grandchildren.
