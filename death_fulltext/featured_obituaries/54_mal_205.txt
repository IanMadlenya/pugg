        Dr. Lazarus A. Orkin, a former chief of urology at Beth Israel Medical Center, died yesterday at St. Francis Hospital in Miami Beach. He was 81 years old and had lived in Miami Beach since he retired 15 years ago.
        He died of a heart attack, his family said.
        Dr. Orkin, who was born in Manhattan, held bachelor's and medical degrees from New York University. He taught at Mount Sinai School of Medicine and was the author of a standard text, "Trauma in the Ureter," published in 1964.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Sylvia Holland; two sons, Dr. Frederick Orkin of San Francisco and Dr. Stuart Orkin of Waban, Mass.; two sisters, Dorothy Scherer and Sophie Chasser, both of Florida, and three grandchildren.
