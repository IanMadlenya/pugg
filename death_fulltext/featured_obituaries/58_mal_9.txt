        Stephen Rubin, a research associate and specialist in American watercolors and drawings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, died on Thursday at Lenox Hill Hospital after collapsing at the museum. He was 53 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, said John Howat, head of the museum's American Wing.
        Mr. Rubin was born in New York on April 2, 1938, and graduated from Dartmouth College in 1960. After more than two decades as a businessman and art collector, he returned to school. He earned a master's degree in art history from the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University in 1987 and began working at the Metropolitan. He was co-curator of the exhibition "American Watercolors From the Metropolitan Museum" currently on view at the museum and also organized "John Singer Sargent's Alpine Sketchbooks: A Schoolboy's Perspective," an exhibition that will open at the Metropolitan on Dec. 24.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Polly Notkins; his mother, Doris; a daughter, Katharine, and two brothers, Richard and Robert, all of New York City.
