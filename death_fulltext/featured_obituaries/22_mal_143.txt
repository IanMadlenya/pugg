        A high school dropout in Los Angeles, he became a wing-walker on stunt airplanes. Rejected by the Army in World War I because of a hearing impairment, he became a civilian instructor in aircraft engineering for the Signal Corps at Langley Field, Va.
        After the war he founded Menasco Motors and set out to develop a new airplane engine to improve on the widely used rotary engine. In 1926 he produced an engine known as the inverted, in-line, air-cooled engine. Before long it was powering aircraft that won major prizes, including the Thompson Trophy in 1937. The company was later sold to Colt Industries, where it is now a division.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Julie Valentin; a son, Albert Jr., of Eagle, Idaho; 7 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.
