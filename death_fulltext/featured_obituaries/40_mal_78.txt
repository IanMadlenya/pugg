        Stephen J. Borell, a piano tuner and technician for some of the world's best-known musicians, died of colon cancer on Monday at his daughter's home in Cumberland, R.I. He was 66 years old and lived in Astoria, Queens.
        Mr. Borell, who was born in New York City in 1923, studied piano and the accordion as a child. He went to work at the Steinway & Sons factory in Astoria, where he was trained as a tuner. He became the head of Steinway's concert department, and he later held the same position at the Baldwin Piano and Organ Company.
        In 1973, Mr. Borell left Baldwin to work independently, which he did until last year. He tuned and regulated pianos for such musicians as Vladimir Horowitz, Leonard Bernstein and Arthur Rubinstein, for whom he also occasionally served as a page turner. Mr. Borell also worked on pianos for many schools, universities and major concert halls in the United States and in Europe.
        He is survived by his second wife, Glorie Lefrak; two daughters, Barbara Allen of Columbia, Md., and Stephanie Stoss of Cumberland, and four grandchildren.
