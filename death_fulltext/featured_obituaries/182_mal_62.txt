        William Root, one of America's greatest bridge players, died on Monday in Boca Raton, Fla. He was 78.
        The cause was cancer, said Michael Rogers of Boynton Beach, Fla., a professional colleague.
        Mr. Root, a professional bridge instructor who may have had more students than anyone else, won 14 national titles, starting in 1953 and ending in 1995, and twice came close to winning a world title.
        In 1967 he was a member of the American team in Miami Beach and reached the final of the Bermuda Bowl, losing to the Italian Blue Team. In 1968 he and his teammates were again second to Italy, playing in the World Team Olympiad in Deauville, France. On both occasions his partner was Alvin Roth. These successes earned him the rank of world life master.
        His national titles included the Vanderbilt Knockout Teams in 1968, 1983, 1986 and 1995 and the Spingold Knockout Teams in 1961, 1966 and 1967.
        His favorite event was the National Board-a-Match Teams, now called the Reisinger, which he won six times, in 1957, 1967, 1982, 1983 1984 and 1990. He was a runner-up in national events nine times. Nearly all his successes in later years were in partnership with Richard Pavlicek of Boca Raton, Fla. Twice, in 1987 and 1992, they came close to representing the United States in world championships, finishing second in the team trials.
        Mr. Root taught bridge in the New York metropolitan area and in Florida. In four decades he had thousands of students. He conducted bridge activities on many cruises and was the author of five books: ''Common Sense Bidding,'' ''The ABC's of Bridge,'' ''How to Play a Bridge Hand,'' ''Modern Bridge Conventions'' (with Mr. Pavlicek) and ''How to Defend a Bridge Hand.'' He made five teaching videos.
        From 1959 to 1965, he directed the Intercollegiate Par Hand tournament, and was a consultant to the Association of American Playing Card Manufacturers. In 1997 he was inducted into the American Contract Bridge League's Hall of Fame.
        Mr. Root was born in Miami and attended the University of Miami. He is survived by a son, Michael Root of Darien, Conn.; a daughter, Mary Bell of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.; and two grandchildren.
