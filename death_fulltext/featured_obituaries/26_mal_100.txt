        Theodore I. Koskoff, one of Connecticut's most widely known trial lawyers, died, apparently of a heart attack, yesterday while being driven to a doctor's office in Milford. He was 75 years old and lived in Westport.
        His son and partner, Michael P. Koskoff, said his father had been experiencing heart trouble for a few months.
        Mr. Koskoff was known for his efforts to improve the image of his profession and to persuade his colleagues to give legal assistance to people unable to obtain it on their own. He acted as lead defense counsel in the Black Panther trials in New Haven in the 1970's, serving as attorney for Lonnie McLucas, a Black Panther charged with kidnapping and conspiracy.
        Mr. Koskoff was the chairman of the law firm of Koskoff, Koskoff & Bieder, which specializes in trial law in both civil and criminal actions. He was a past president of the American Trial Lawyers Association and its Connecticut affiliate.
        Mr. Koskoff was a former chairman of the National Board of Trial Advocacy, an organization he had proposed which certifies lawyers for their competency in courtroom law. He also founded the Roscoe Pound-American Trial Lawyers Foundation, an educational organization.
        Mr. Koskoff, a native of New Haven, was a graduate of Wesleyan University and received his law degree from Boston University in 1936. He was in individual practice from 1937 until 1972, when he became chairman of the present law firm, whose main office is in Bridgeport.
        Besides his son, he is survived by his wife, the former Dorothy Fuchs; two daughters, Susan Glazer of Newton, Mass., and Elizabeth Koskoff of Hamden, Conn.; a brother, Milton, of Plainville, Conn., and eight grandchildren.
