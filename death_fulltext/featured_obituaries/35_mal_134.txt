        He started his practice in 1922 in Ottawa and in 1926 moved to New York, opening a private practice in Manhattan. That year, he became professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Cornell University Medical School, where he taught for 60 years. He retired in 1986.
        Over the years, he acquired one of the country's largest private collections of Lincoln memorabilia. In 1988, he donated the collection to McGill University in Montreal. He graduated from McGill Medical College in 1919.
        He is survived by a son, Bernard, of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.
