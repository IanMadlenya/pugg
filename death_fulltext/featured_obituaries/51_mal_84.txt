        Harry Ginsberg, a philanthropist and industrialist who founded the National Container Corporation, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 102 years old.
        He died of heart failure, said his son-in-law, Murray Steyer.
        Mr. Ginsberg was born in Russia in 1888 and came to the United States in 1905. He started in the corrugated box business and later formed Columbia Corrugated, which in 1938 merged with several others to form the National Container Corporation in Long Island City.
        The company expanded to become one of the largest box manufacturers in the United States and in 1956 merged with the Owens-Illiois Glass Company. He retired about five years later.
        Mr. Ginsberg was an active supporter of Jewish causes and contributed to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University and to the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies. He was also a trustee of the Brooklyn Jewish Hospital and served on the board of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society for more than 50 years.
        He is survived by two daughters, Beatrice Steyer of Scarsdale, N.Y., and Rhoda Hecht of West Palm Beach, Fla.; two sons, Arnold and Martin, both of Manhattan; a sister, Rose Edelson of Brooklyn; eight grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
