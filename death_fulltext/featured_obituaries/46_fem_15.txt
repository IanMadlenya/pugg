        Jacqueline Schwartzman, a community leader in the Chelsea section of Manhattan for many years, died on Thursday at her home in Chelsea. She was 71 years old.
        She had undergone exploratory surgery four weeks ago, but the cause of death is not known, said her husband, Dr. Isidore Schwartzman.
        Mrs. Schwartzman, who was born in Chelsea, was an early member of the block association movement in New York City in the 1950's and was the first president of the West 22d Street Association. She was a founder and past president of the Chelsea Independent Democrats.
        In addition to her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Leslie Blake and Cheryl Bulbach, both of Manhattan; two sons, Stephen Short of Manhattan and Dr. Wayne Blackmon of Washington, and two grandchildren.
