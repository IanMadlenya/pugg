        David McLean, a movie and television actor who appeared for many years as the Marlboro Man in television commercials, died on Oct. 12 at the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center. He was 73.
        The cause was lung cancer, said Bernie Johnson, a funeral director at Gates Kingsley Gates mortuary.
        Mr. McLean's big break came in 1960 when he starred in "Tate," a summer-replacement television show on NBC. He then appeared in a string of television Western series, including "Bonanza," "The Westerner," "High Chaparral," "The Virginian" and "Gunsmoke."
        His film credits included "X-15" (1961), "The Andromeda Strain" (1971) and "Kingdom of the Spiders" (1977). He worked in numerous television commercials in addition to those for Marlboro cigarettes.
        He is survived by his wife, Lilo, and a son, Mark.
