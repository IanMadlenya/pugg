        William E. Sauro, a photographer for The New York Times and other news organizations, died on Saturday in Mission Viejo, Calif. He was 78 and lived in Laguna Woods, Calif., and earlier in Kendall Park, N.J.
        He died of Alzheimer's disease in an assisted living center, his family said.
        Mr. Sauro was on the staff of The Times from 1967 until he retired in 1996.
        Thousands of his photographs have illustrated news articles in The Times as well as other publications. As a top general-assignment photographer, Mr. Sauro won awards within The Times for distinguished pictures of sometimes ephemeral events and other prizes from what is now United Press International.
        He won the George Polk Memorial Award for photo reporting in 1955 for a picture taken for United Press of Helen Keller, who was blind and deaf, ''listening,'' by using her fingertips, to Eleanor Roosevelt.
        He was also especially noted for his pictures of the Kennedy administration.
        A native of Cleveland, he came to New York in 1952 and worked as a photographer successively for United Press Photos, The New York Herald Tribune and The World Journal Tribune, a short-lived New York City newspaper, before moving to The Times.
        He attended Cleveland College and was a sergeant in Europe in World War II.
        Survivors include his wife, the former Jeannette Hammond; two daughters, Nina Maginnis of Orange Park Acres, Calif., and Adrienne Heckman of Irvine, Calif.; four grandchildren; and a sister, Helen Georgio, and a half brother, Fred Marchionna, both of Santa Maria, Calif.
