        William Koehler, a trainer who taught dogs to perform in many movies and television shows, died on Wednesday at his home in Sequim, Wash. He was 82.
        The cause of death was a heart attack, said his wife, Lillian.
        Mr. Koehler, a trainer for 50 years, was the author of six books about dog obedience and how to teach dogs to track and guard. The books have sold more than one million copies.
        Mr. Koehler worked for Walt Disney Studios for more than 20 years. Among the films his charges appeared in were "The Shaggy Dog," "Big Red" and "The Incredible Journey."
        He trained more than 25,000 dogs, including many for the Army during World War II.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Koehler is survived by two sons, Dick and Ray; a daughter, Ann Smith; six grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
