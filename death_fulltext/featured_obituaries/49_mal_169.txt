        Roger Edge Clapp, a theoretical physicist and inventor, died Tuesday at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 71 years old.
        He died of cancer, a spokesman for the family said.
        Dr. Clapp, who received his doctorate at Harvard University, worked on the development of radar while with the Radiation Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1942 to 1946. He was a fellow at the Atomic Energy Commission before entering private industry.
        He was president of Basic Research Associates Inc. in Cambridge and most recently was a research scientist at the Mitre Corporation in Bedford, Mass.
        He published articles on gravitational theory, electromagnetic field theory and high-temperature superconductivity and received patents for inventions in radioastronomy, radiometric receivers and nonimpact printing.
        He is survived by his wife, Linda Cabot Black; a daughter, Katherine Clapp of Chapel Hill, N.C.; a son, Roger of Berkeley, Calif.; two sisters, Mary Gileno of Bethesda, Md. and Nancy Mellon of Orange, Calif.; and one grandson.
