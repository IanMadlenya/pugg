        Kenneth Dodson, who wrote best-selling books about his experiences as a seaman in World War II, died on May 24 at his home in Stanwood, Wash. He was 91.
        After graduating from high school, Mr. Dodson spent 20 years in the Merchant Marine. Shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, he enlisted in the Navy and saw action in nine major battles, including Okinawa. He was injured and received numerous medals and citations. He left the service in 1947 as a lieutenant commander.
        In the early 1950's, the poet Carl Sandburg, a friend, encouraged Mr. Dodson to write about his experiences during the war.
        Mr. Dodson then took creative writing classes at the University of Washington and produced a popular novel, ''Away All Boats'' (1954), about the inexperienced crew of the attack transport Belinda. The book was made into a successful film in 1956 starring Jeff Chandler, Richard Boone, David Janssen and Lex Barker.
        He wrote several other books, including ''Stranger to the Shore'' (1956), ''Hector the Stowaway Dog'' (1958), which was made into a Walt Disney television movie, and ''The China Pirates'' (1960). His last book, ''The Poet and the Sailor,'' was completed shortly before his death.
        Mr. Dodson was born in Luanda, Angola, on Oct. 11, 1907. His parents were missionaries who later moved to England and then to California.
        He is survived by his wife, Oletha; a daughter, Jeanie Unger of Olalla, Wash., and a son, Richard, of Los Angeles.
