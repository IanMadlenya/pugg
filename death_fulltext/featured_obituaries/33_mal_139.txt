        Mr. Saunders was instrumental in mounting many major art exhibitions in the 1970's and 80's, including collections from the Vatican, the works of Edward Hopper and Jasper Johns and the widely seen exhibit ''Two Centuries of Black American Art.''

        Mr. Saunders was a former associate editor of Fortune magazine and a senior vice president of the public relations firm of Ruder & Finn. He was a native of the Fordham section of the Bronx and a graduate of DeWitt Clinton High School and City College. In World War II he was an Army sergeant and combat historian in the South Pacific. He was also a former president of the Bronx Museum of the Arts.
        Surviving are his wife, Ruth, a psychoanalyst; three sons, Michael, of Toronto, and Mark and Anthony, of Manhattan; two daughters, Joan Markham of Yonkers and Frances Hoffmann of Mercerville, N.J., and four grandchildren.
