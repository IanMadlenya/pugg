        Mr. Jeremias founded the company in the early 1950's and was president from its inception. He retired in 1981. At his death, he was a governor of the New York chapter of the American Jewish Committee and had been a member of the committee's national board of governors. For many years he was a trustee of the City Club of New York, one of the oldest nonprofit civic organizations.
        Mr. Jeremias was born in Posen, Germany, which is now Poznan, Poland. He escaped the Nazis in the late 1930's by making his way to France, crossing the Pyrenees into Spain on foot and taking a ship to Manhattan. He began his United States career in the 1940's with the International Affairs Department of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, where he was director of foreign relief for several years.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Trudy Epstein; a sister, Betty Cohen of Deganiya, Israel, and a brother, Benjamin, of Nahariya, Israel.
