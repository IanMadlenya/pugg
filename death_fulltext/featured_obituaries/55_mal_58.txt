        Sanford Hegleman Bolz, a lawyer who as Washington counsel for the American Jewish Congress was active in civil rights cases in the 1950's, died Monday at the Washington Hospice. He was 76 years old and lived in Washington.
        He died of cancer, said his daughter Jody.
        After graduating from Cornell University Law School in 1938, Mr. Bolz was a research assistant with the New York State Law Revision Commission and an associate with a Manhattan law firm before joining the National Labor Relations Board in 1941. He was a lawyer with several other Government agencies before going into private practice in Washington in 1946.
        From 1948 to 1960, he was also the counsel to the American Jewish Congress and wrote friend-of-the-court briefs in several important desegregation and civil liberties cases. He practiced law in Salinas, Calif., from 1960 to 1965 and returned to Washington as counsel for the American Jewish Committee. From 1968 until his retirement in 1980 he was general counsel and senior vice president of the Empire State Chamber of Commerce in Albany.
        He is survived by his wife, Joyce; two daughters, Jody Bolz of Bethesda, Md., and Diane Miriam Bolz of Washington, and three grandchildren.
