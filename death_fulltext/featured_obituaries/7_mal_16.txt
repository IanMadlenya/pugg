        James L. Nuckolls, a lighting designer, teacher and author, died last Thursday at his home in Manhattan of complications stemming from acquired immune deficiency syndrome. He was 49 years old.
        Mr. Nuckolls, who operated a lighting-design consulting company, had taught for the last 15 years at the Parsons School of Design, where he was director of lighting studies and head of the department's master's program. His 1982 book, ''Interior Lighting for Environmental Designers,'' widely regarded as a valuable layman's guide, recently went into its second printing.
        Mr. Nuckolls, a San Francisco native, was a contributing editor of Interiors magazine and a past president and founding member of the International Association of Lighting Designers.
        He was a graduate of the University of California at Berkeley and received a master's degree in fine arts from Carnegie-Mellon University.
        He is survived by his mother.
