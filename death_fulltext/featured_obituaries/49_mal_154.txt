        John C. Woodhouse, an inventor who was a research scientist for E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company for 34 years, died on Sunday at Crozer-Chester Medical Center in Upland, Pa. He was 92 years old and lived in Crossland, Pa.
        He died of a heart attack, his family said.
        Dr. Woodhouse, a native of New Bedford, Mass., received bachelor's and master's degrees from Dartmouth and a doctorate from Harvard. He taught chemistry at Dartmouth and Harvard before joining Du Pont as a research chemist in 1928.
        In World War II he worked on the development of uranium fuel elements for nuclear reactors and in 1950 he was named manager of du Pont's atomic energy division. He retired in 1962 after having been granted 70 patents.
        His inventions ranged from chemicals that form "sudsless" detergent soaps to hydraulic brake fluid and antifreeze compounds for automobiles, a substance to retard spoilage in bread and soft plastic lenses for the eyes.
        Dr. Woodhouse's wife, the former Anna Houth, whom he married in 1935, died in 1982. He is survived by two sons, Richard, of Madrid, Me., and John, of Houston; five grandchildren and a great-grandson.
