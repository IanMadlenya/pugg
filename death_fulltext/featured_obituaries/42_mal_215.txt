        Jean Fourastie, an economist who helped oversee the reconstruction of postwar France, has died. He was 83 years old.
        A statement from the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences, once headed by Mr. Fourastie, said the economist died on Wednesday in the Lot region of south-central France. It gave no cause of death. Mr. Fourastie worked with Jean Monnet and Pierre Masse in planning economic and industrial policies after World War II.
        He was born on April 15, 1907, and was long a commentator for the Paris newspaper Le Figaro and the weekly news magazine L'Express. He also wrote many books, including ''The Great Hope of the 20th Century'' and ''40,000 Hours.''
        In addition to economics, his works dealt with travel, religion and higher education. Mr. Fourastie married in 1935 and had four children, one of whom died. No funeral arrangements have been announced.
