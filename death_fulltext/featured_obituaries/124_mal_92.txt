        Fletcher Guard Watson, an astronomer and educator whose innovative methods took science subjects to a wider audience, died on May 7 at the Youville Nursing Home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 85 and lived in Belmont and North Eastham, Mass.
        Born in Baltimore, he graduated from Pomona College in 1933 and earned his doctorate in astronomy at Harvard University five years later. He then joined the staff of the Harvard College Observatory.
        In 1941 he published a book, ''Between the Planets'', a guide to the solar system written for the general reader.
        He then served as a Navy officer in World War II and helped develop the long range navigation system, Loran. After the war he was appointed professor of science education at the graduate school in 1946. When he reached emeritus status at Harvard in 1977, he continued as a professor of education at New York University until 1981. There he directed N.Y.U.'s Project City Sciences to train professionals for inner-city schools.
        Dr. Watson is survived by his wife, Alice Hodson Watson; four sons, Alexander of Washington, Jonathan of Ridgefield, Conn, Stephen of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Christopher of Pascoag, R.I.; eight grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
