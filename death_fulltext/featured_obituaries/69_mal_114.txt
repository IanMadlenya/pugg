        Donald E. Oberg, an internationally known tool-and-die expert, died on Oct. 10 at his retirement home in Jupiter, Fla. He was 76 years old.
        His family reported his death yesterday and said the cause was cancer.
        A native of Hartford, Mr. Oberg attended Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh. In 1948, he founded the Oberg Manufacturing Company, makers of precision carbide dies, and led it until he retired and became chairman emeritus in 1989. The company, based in Freeport, Pa., also has a branch in Chandler, Ariz. Mr. Oberg also operated businesses in London and Singapore.
        American Machinist magazine named him "Man of the Year" in 1985 for his "pioneer work in making carbide a die material and for an entrepreneurial spirit, demanding adherence to standards and dedication to training that combined to build an industry." Over the years, Mr. Oberg trained many of the owners of other tool-and-die companies that came to "Carbide Valley" in western Pennsylvania.
        Mr. Oberg is survived by his second wife, Susan Jacob Michaels Oberg; a son, Eric, of Chandler; a daughter, Karen Oberg of Fox Chapel, Pa.; a stepson, Dr. Andrew Michaels of Pittsburgh; a stepdaughter, Melissa Michaels of Boulder, Colo.; a brother, Norman, of Staunton, Va.; four grandsons, and two step-granddaughters. His previous marriage to M. Alice Oberg of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., ended in divorce.
