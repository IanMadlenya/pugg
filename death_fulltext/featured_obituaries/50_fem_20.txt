        Rose M. Singer, an original member of the New York City Board of Correction and founder and president emeritus of the Friendly Vistors, a service group that helps women in prison, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 94 years old.
        She died of heart failure, said her son Martin.
        Mrs. Singer, for whom the new women's prison at Rikers Island, the Rose M. Singer Center, is named, was active in civic affairs for most of her adult life. She was appointed by Mayor Robert F. Wagner to the City Board of Correction at its inception in 1957 and, at her death, was its last original member.
        In the early 1950's, she was founder and first president of the Friendly Visitors, in which she remained active until her death.  National and City Awards
        Mrs. Singer was chairwoman of the voluntary advisory council to the Department of Correction, and of the executive committee of the Women's Prison Association. She was also vice chairwoman of the Citizens Union of the City of New York and a trustee of the National Conference of Christians and Jews.
        In 1977 Mrs Singer was named as one of 50 Women of Achievement by the National Conference of Christians and Jews at its 50th anniversary celebration, and in 1956 she received the city's award for distinguished and exceptional service from Mayor Wagner for 20 years of volunteer activity, an award that she received again from other mayors, most recently Edward I. Koch.
        She was born in Brooklyn, graduated from Brooklyn College and received an M.A. degree in child psychology from Columbia University.
        She is survived by three sons, Ronald E., of North Hollywood, Calif., Edward S., of Westwood, Calif., and Martin B., of Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif.; seven grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
