        Prof. E. Dwight Salmon, who taught history at Amherst College for 37 years until he retired in 1963, died on Sunday at Martha's Vineyard Hospital in Oak Bluffs, Mass. He was 98 and lived in nearby Chilmark on Martha's Vineyard.
        Professor Salmon taught an introductory course in world history as well as courses on the history of the Middle Ages, Russia, Latin America, the French Revolution, the Napoleonic era and the 20th century.
        During his tenure, Amherst became a principal training ground for historians. A survey by the American Historical Society rated the college first in the number of graduates who received doctorates in history from 1936 to 1956.
        He was a native of Lima, N.Y., and received a bachelor's degree from the University of Rochester. He received a master's degree and a Ph.D. in history from Harvard University, where he taught for three years before joining the Amherst faculty in 1926. At his retirement he was Winkley Professor of History, and, in his honor, Amherst endowed an E. Dwight Salmon Professorship in History four years ago.
        His first wife, Irene Loughborough Salmon, died in 1973.
        He is survived by his second wife, Mary Linscott Salmon; four stepdaughters, Cynthia Seifert of Foxboro, Mass., Priscilla Lucier of Wayland, Mass., Susan Hull of Atherton, Calif., and Paula Cole of White Stone, Va.; 15 step-grandchildren and 12 step-great-grandchildren.
