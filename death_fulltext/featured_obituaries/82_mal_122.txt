        C. Clark Zantzinger Jr., a founder of the Philadelphia architectural firm Kneedler, Mirick & Zantzinger died on Sunday at his home in Haverford, Pa. He was 89.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Mary.
        Mr. Zantzinger's firm, founded in 1935, designed office buildings, hospitals, churches, museums, schools and houses in the Philadelphia area. He retired in 1969 but continued to work on private commissions in Pennsylvania and Maine, where he had a summer house on Mount Desert Island.
        He graduated from Yale University in 1926 and received architectural degrees from the University of Pennsylvania.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Amory Stedman of Norwell, Mass., and Katharine Okie of Downington, Pa., and six grandchildren.
