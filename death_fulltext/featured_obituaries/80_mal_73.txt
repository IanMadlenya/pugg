        Dr. Louis Zetzel, a gastroenterologist on the faculty at Harvard University Medical School and a private physician who made house calls until he was 77, died on Monday at the Newton and Wellesley Alzheimer Center in Massachusetts. He was 84 and lived in Cambridge, Mass.
        His family said the cause was complications from Parkinson's disease.

        In honor of his 75th birthday, Harvard established a visiting professorship in his name.
        Mr. Zetzel, who originally intended to become a rabbi, maintained a lifetime interest in Jewish affairs and causes.
