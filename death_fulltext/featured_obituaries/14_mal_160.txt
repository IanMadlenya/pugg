        Mr. Gould joined the Radio City Music Hall Corporation in 1932, the year the palatial 6,200-seat Art Deco theater opened. Serving as its president from 1966 to 1973, he helped expand the theater's programming to include jazz and rock concerts and closed-circuit telecasts of sporting events.
        Mr. Gould also served on the board of the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, and was a member of many motion-picture associations. He was born in Plymouth, England, and moved to the United States in 1929.
        Mr. Gould is survived by his wife, Ethel, of Clearwater; two sons, Donald, of Hampton, N.H., and Robert, of West Redding, Conn., and eight grandchildren.
