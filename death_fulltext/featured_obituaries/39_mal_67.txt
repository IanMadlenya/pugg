        The Rev. W. Harold Flowers, a patriarch of the civil rights movement in Arkansas and its oldest practicing black lawyer, died Saturday at a hospital here. He was 78 years old and had been suffering from cancer.
        In 1947, in one of his most memorable cases, Mr. Flowers defended two black men who had been charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of two white men. He made a motion to quash the entire jury on the ground that there had been no black jurors in nearly 50 years. That led to the placement of 13 blacks on the prospective jurors' panel, and three were eventually seated on the jury.
        And the defendants were found guilty of lesser charges, the first time in Arkansas that a black man had not gone to the electric chair upon a conviction involving the death of a white man.
        Mr. Flowers was ordained as a Methodist minister in 1971. In 1977, he was the first black named a special circuit judge for Jefferson County. In 1980, Gov. Bill Clinton appointed him as an associate justice of the State Court of Appeals.
        A founder and former president of the National Bar Association, he was inducted into the association's Hall of Fame in 1986 and was a past president of the American Bar Association and past state president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
