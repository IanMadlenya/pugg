        Bishop Zgon Der Hagopian, former Primate of the Armenian Dioceses of Baghdad and of Milan, died on Monday at the Frances Schervier Home and Hospital in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, where he lived. He was 86 years old.
        He died of complications following hip surgery, said a spokesman for the church, Christopher H. Zakian.
        Bishop Zgon, whose great-grandfather, grandfather and uncle were also priests of the church, was born in Van, Turkey. His entire family was lost during World War I when vast numbers of Armenian civilians died at the hands of the Ottoman Turks by forced resettlement, starvation and shooting.
        In 1930 he was ordained a priest after graduating from the Seminary of the Armenian Patriarchate of St. James in Jerusalem, where he remained as a teacher. During World War II he came to New York, where he edited the Armenian-language edition of the church's monthly magazine and served as pastor of St. Gregory the Illuminator Church in Manhattan.
        In 1956 Father Zgon was named to head the Diocese of Baghdad and in 1958 he was elevated to the rank of Bishop. After service in Armenia he was made Primate of the Diocese of Milan in 1962, a post he held until he retired in 1975 for health reasons.
        Bishop Zgon served for two years as the resident representative of the Armenian Church at the Roman Catholic Second Vatican Council. As a result of associations formed there, he lived for the last several years at the Schervier Home for retired Roman Catholic clergy.
        He leaves no survivors.
