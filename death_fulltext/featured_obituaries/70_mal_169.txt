        Dr. Samuel Hillel Sobel, a Bronx obstetrician and general practitioner who retired in 1990 after 57 years of practice, died on Saturday at his Bronx home. He was 83 years old.
        He died of lung cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Sobel, a native New Yorker, graduated from New York University and its School of Medicine.
        In the 1930's he worked at Harlem Hospital with Dr. Henry Falk, a gynecologist who developed techniques to improve survival rates for women after childbirth and abdominal surgery.
        He gave up his own obstetric practice 10 years ago but continued as a general practitioner until his retirement. A sailing enthusiast, he and his wife sailed their own boat until a year ago when his health began to fail.
        Dr. Sobel is survived by his wife of 61 years, the former Betty Gruber; two sons, Dr. Michael Sobel of Groton, Mass., and Dr. Stephen Sobel of Los Angeles; a daughter, Dava Sobel of East Hampton, L.I.; a sister, Helene Salzberg of Stony Brook, L.I., and five grandchildren.
