        Jefferey D. Bucholtz, an architectural designer, died Thursday at the Davies Medical Center in San Francisco. He was 33 years old. Michael Goldblum, a colleague of his, said he had died of AIDS.
        Mr. Bucholtz worked for Carl Hribar, a New York architect, from 1985 to 1989, on projects ranging from apartment renovations to new homes. These included the Long Island residence of Phillippe de Montebello, director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
        He also worked for Kohn, Pedersen, Fox, architects, and did independent work on commercial and residential interiors and furniture. From 1988 to 1989 he taught architectural drawing as an adjunct associate professor at Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation.
        Mr. Bucholtz was born in Palo Alto, Calif., and raised in Fremont, Calif. He graduated from the University of California at Berkeley and received a master's degree in architecture from Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture and Planning. He edited Precis V, Columbia's graduate architecture journal, and received a medal from the American Institute of Architects for outstanding achievement in architectural design.
        As his illness worsened, he moved back to San Francisco, where the story of his life with AIDS was told in a series of articles in The San Francisco Examiner. Early last month, Mr. Bucholtz terminated his medication, Mr. Goldblum said.
        He is survived by his father, Robert; two brothers, Michael and Steven, and a sister, Kathy Alexander, all of the San Francisco area.
