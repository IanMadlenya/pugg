        Dr. Bean was professor and head of internal medicine in the University of Iowa College of Medicine and physician in chief at the university's hospitals and clinic from 1948 until he re tired in 1970.
        Dr. Bean engaged in research in heat acclimatization starting in World War II, when he gathered data on the degree of heat troops could tolerate in tanks. He also did research in nutrition, including induced vitamin deficiencies in humans.
        He was the author of seven books, the most recent of which, ''Walter Reed,'' was published in 1982.
        He was born in Manila, the Phillipines, and received his B.A. and his medical degree from the University of Virginia.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Abigail Jane Shepard; a daughter, Margaret Bayog of Lexington, Mass., two sons, Bennett of Blairstown, N.J. and John of Bloomington, Ind.; and five grandchildren. A brother, the Rev. George Bean of Lynchburg, Va., and a sister, Helen Emery of Bethlehem, Pa., also survive.
