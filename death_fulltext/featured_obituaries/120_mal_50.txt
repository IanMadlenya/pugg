        Arnold Michaelis, a television producer and host who interviewed heads of state and other public figures during a long career on television and radio, died on Jan. 4 at his home in Manhattan. He was 81.
        In the mid-1950's, when Mr. Michaelis was a producer for the Masterworks division of Columbia Records, he was asked to interview Bruno Walter for brief radio commercials to promote the conductor's records. Columbia was so pleased with the result that it released the interview as a record. That began Mr. Michaelis's role as interviewer. His subjects ranged from Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d to Eleanor Roosevelt and two Indian Prime Ministers, Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi.
        From 1961 to 1963 he was the producer (with Stanley A. Frankel) and host of ABC-TV's ''Adlai Stevenson Reports,'' in which Mr. Michaelis and Mr. Stevenson, the United States delegate to the United Nations, had conversations with world leaders. The series won a George Foster Peabody Award for its ''contribution to international understanding.''
        Mr. Michaelis said that he sought ''to create an atmosphere of informality and cordiality'' in his interviews. Within that context, he said, ''you can go anywhere.''
        Last year, Mr. Michaelis won a second Peabody Award, for lifetime achievement.
        He is survived by a son, Dana Ames Michaelis of Atlanta; a daughter, Lisa Michaelis-Schlosser of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
