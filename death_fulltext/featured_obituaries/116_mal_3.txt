        Zeke Segal, a former Southeastern bureau chief for CBS News who was considered the dean of Atlanta's media corps during the years when what has been called the New South was emerging, died on Aug. 22 in Atlanta. He was 78 years old.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his son-in-law, Nick Taylor.
        Mr. Segal's duties included supervising news coverage in the South and in Latin America and the Caribbean. In that position, from 1973 to 1983, he was an unofficial clearinghouse for information for reporters.
        A native of New York City, he was a 1938 graduate of the Yale University School of Drama. He joined CBS News in 1962 and, after several assignments in New York, became chief of the bureau in Atlanta.
        He is survived by his wife, Theo; two children, Barbara Nevins Taylor of New York City and Hope Tudanger of Atlanta; a brother, Robert,  of Lake Worth, Fla., and one grandson.
