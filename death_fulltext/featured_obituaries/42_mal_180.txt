        Mr. Turner, who helped make famous the stride style of piano playing, was born in Baltimore on Nov. 3, 1907. His big break came in 1928, when he was hired for the Benny Carter orchestra. He joined Armstrong's group in 1930, and played the Harlem clubs.
        He was drafted in World War II, and played piano in the Army orchestra directed by Sy Oliver.
        After the war, he settled in Europe. He had lived in Paris since 1962 and often played at La Calavados, a night club on the Champs Elysees.
