        Elizabeth Meusebach Carrington, who did volunteer work for a variety of charitable organizations, died yesterday at her Upper East Side home. She was 77 years old.
        She died of cancer of the esophagus, said a daughter, Judith C. Green of Manhattan.
        At the time of her death Mrs. Carrington was on the board of the Youth Counseling League, which aids troubled children. Earlier she was its president for seven years, a vice president of the New York Junior League and a member of the auxiliary board of the New York Philharmonic.
        A native of St. Louis, she was married in 1934 to John C. Carrington, who became an executive vice president of The Freeport Minerals Company and the president of the Hewitt School's board of trustees. He died in 1979.
        She is also survived by her daughter Elizabeth C. Bierman of Manhattan and four grandchildren.
