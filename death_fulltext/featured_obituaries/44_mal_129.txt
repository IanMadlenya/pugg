He was 75 years old. He died of melanoma, a family spokesman said. His popular allegorical books include ''The Enormous Egg'' (1956), ''The Trouble With Jenny's Ear'' (1960) and ''The Narrow Passage'' (1973). He once wrote that his novels for children sprang from ''a deeply rooted American skepticism of social institutions and a corresponding tendency to believe in the independent untaught individual.''
        Mr. Butterworth, a native of Hartford, earned a B.A. at Dartmouth College and an M.A. at Middlebury College. He previously taught at the Kent School in Connecticut.
        He was a longtime volunteer with the Hartford Stage Company, the Hartford Ballet and the Barnstormers, a summer theater in Tamworth, N.H. He was also on the boards of many civic groups, including the Mark Twain Memorial.
        Surviving are his wife, Miriam; his mother, Elizabeth, and daughter, Kate de Valdez, both of West Hartford; three sons, Michael, of Tolland, Conn., Timothy, of Chesterfield, N.H., and Dan, of Pascoag, R.I.; a brother, Harrison, of Contoocook, N.H.; three sisters, Virginia Parmalee of Salt Lake City, Jean Robinson of Hanover, N.H., and Lucy Townsend of West Hartford, and nine grandchildren.
