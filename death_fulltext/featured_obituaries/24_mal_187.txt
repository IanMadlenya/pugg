        Dr. Hudson, a dentist for 58 years, had served since 1953 on the national board of directors of the N.A.A.C.P.
        He was born to sharecroppers in Marksville, La., and came to Los Angeles in 1923. He graduated from Wiley College in Texas and from Howard University Dental School in Washington.
        While head of the Los Angeles N.A.A.C.P. chapter, Dr. Hudson was involved in efforts to end segregation on county beaches. He and seven others were jailed briefly in 1925 after wading into the ocean at Manhattan Beach to test the policy.
