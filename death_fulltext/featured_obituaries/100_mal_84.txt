        Leo Zippin, a professor emeritus of mathematics at Queens College, died on May 11 at his home in Manhattan, a spokesman of the college said. He was 90.
        Dr. Zippin helped to create the doctoral program in mathematics at CUNY and served as its first executive officer, from 1964 to 1968. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1970.
        He became known internationally in the 1950's for having helped solve "the fifth problem of Hilbert," a poser regarding locally Euclidean topological groups. In a lecture in 1900 in Paris, the German mathematician David Hilbert presented his colleagues with 23 famous puzzlers. They set much of the research agenda for 20th century mathematics, and some remain unsolved to this day.
        Dr. Zippin received his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1929. He joined the Queens faculty in 1938. He retired in 1971.
        Dr. Zippin is survived by his wife, Frances; two daughters, Prof. Nina Baym of Urbana, Ill., and Vivian Narehood of Lancaster, Pa., and three grandchildren.
