        Born in Stamford, Conn., Rabbi Friedman graduated from City College of New York, receiving a master's degree and Ph.D. from Columbia University. He was ordained by the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, which awarded him a Doctor of Divinity in 1964.
        While rabbi of Maplewood and the Oranges from 1954 to 1970, he was a visiting professor at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York.
        His first wife, Ruth Braunhut, died in 1973.
        Surviving are his wife, Florence, of Jerusalem; a son, Hillel, a rabbi in Manhattan; two daughters, Naomi, of Manhattan, and Judith Rotem of Israel; eight grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
