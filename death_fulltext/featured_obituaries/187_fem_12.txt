        Freidann Parker, a founder of the Colorado Ballet, died on Aug. 2 in Denver, where she lived. She was 77.
        The cause was a bacterial infection, said her companion, Lillian Covillo, a co-founder of the troupe.
        Ms. Parker was typical of the pioneers, mostly unsung, who developed American ballet outside the nation's large urban areas. She began her training in a neighborhood dance school in Denver, where the troupe is based, and by 10 was performing Shirley Temple-style dance numbers in nightclubs. She went on to study modern dance with Hanya Holm in New York, then returned west when Holm taught workshops in Colorado.
        Ms. Parker and Ms. Covillo, whom she met soon after, were unable to find performing jobs, so they opened a dance school in 1951. The company, originally called the Colorado Concert Ballet, grew out of the school 10 years later, and by 1976 had professional status. In 1987 the financially hard-pressed troupe allied with the Tampa Ballet. Tampa's director, Martin Fredmann, moved west in 1997 to direct the Colorado Ballet, though Ms. Parker and Ms. Covillo continued to be involved.
        She is survived by Ms. Covillo, of Denver.
