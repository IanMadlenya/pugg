        Charles Dawson Butler, the voice of Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound, Quick Draw McGraw and dozens of other cartoon characters, died Wednesday of a heart attack at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. He was 71 years old.
        Daws Butler, as he was professionally known at Hanna-Barbera Productions, had suffered a stroke and had been battling pneumonia in the last few months, the studio said Thursday.
        ''He was one of the most talented artists we've ever been associated with,'' Joe Barbera, president of Hanna-Barbera, said. ''Here's a man who walked into a studio in 1957 and helped us launch this whole company.''
        Mr. Butler was the voice of 42 regular characters on cartoon series, among them Snagglepuss, Wally Gator, Baba Looey, Augie Doggie, Mr. Jinks, Lippy the Lion, Snooper and Blabber, as well as hundreds of incidental characters.
        He was also the voice of Cap'n Crunch for the Quaker Oats cereal company, and of many characters in Jay Ward's ''Fractured Fairy Tales'' and ''Aesop and Son.'' Kellogg's used his voice for Snap, one of the Rice Crispies characters.
        Mr. Butler was born in Toledo, Ohio, and grew up in Oak Park, Ill. He took part in amateur contests as a young man, doing impersonations of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Rudy Vallee and a Model-T Ford starting up. During World War II he served in the Naval Reserve.
        His wife, Myrtis, was from North Carolina, and Mr. Butler maintained that Huckleberry Hound's Southern accent came from listening to her family and neighbors.
        Mr. Butler is survived by his wife and four sons, David, Donald, Paul and Charles.
