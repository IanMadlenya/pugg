        Dr. Helen Quincy Woodard, an authority on bone disease, died at her home in Hartsdale, N.Y., on Sunday. She was 92.
        Dr. Woodard was a biochemist at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, which she joined after receiving her Ph.D. in chemistry from Columbia University in 1925. She did groundbreaking work in understanding and identifying cancers induced by environmental radiation.
        She published research on phosphate metabolism in bone in the 1940's, and she founded the laboratory that evolved into the Department of Chemistry at the center.
        Dr. Woodard also published pioneering papers on radiation-induced osteogenic sarcomas in people who painted radium dials on watches.
        She was a consultant to the International Council on Radiation Units and to the New York City Health Department for more than 20 years.
        She endowed the Woodard Fellowships at Columbia University, a fellowship at the New York University School of Environmental Medicine and the John Laughlin Professorship at the Sloan-Kettering center. She was an active member of the Nature Conservancy.
