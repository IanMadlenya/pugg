        Roger Bennett Etherington, a retired New Jersey banker and former chairman of Horizon Bancorp, now part of Chemical Bank of New York, died on Tuesday at Mountainside Hospital in Montclair, N.J. He was 66 years old and lived in Upper Montclair, N.J.
        Mr. Etherington died of lymphoma, said his wife, the former Barbara Dean.
        His career was spent as an officer of the Montclair Trust Company and its succeeding banks, the last of which was Horizon Bancorp, a holding company.
        In 1976 he was elected chairman of Horizon Bancorp, a post he held until he retired in 1988. At that time, it was acquired by Chemical Bank of New York. He remained a director of Chemical Bank of New Jersey until his death.
        Mr. Etherington served in the Army in World War II and was recalled to service in the Korean War.
        He was born in Bayonne, N.J., and received a bachelor's degree from Columbia University.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, R. Barrie, of Raleigh, N.C.; three daughters, Sandra Tucker of Aiken, S.C., Caryn Etherington of Middlebury, Vt., and Kim Bernardo of Ballston Spa, N.Y.; two brothers, Edwin, of Hobe Sound, Fla., and Donald, of Washington Depot, Conn., and four grandchildren.
