        Gary Bruce Vowels, an architect and planner, died on Monday at his home in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. He was 57 years old.
        He died from an illness related to polio he contracted as a boy, said his wife, Lenore M. Lucey.
        For the last 30 years, Mr. Vowels worked for Edward Durell Stone Associates, an architectural concern with offices in New York City and Oyster Bay, L.I. He became principal in charge of design in 1974.
        Many of the company's significant projects were planned and designed by Mr. Vowels. These included the Museo de Arte in Ponce, Puerto Rico, which won a First Honor Award from the American Institute of Architects, of which he was a member, and the College of Staten Island.
        He was born in Jonesboro, Ark., and graduated with degrees in architecture and fine arts from the University of Arkansas in 1956.
        In addition to his wife, who is the executive director of the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects, he is survived by a son, Sean, and a daughter, Courtney, both of Dobbs Ferry; his mother, Marian S. Vowels, and a sister, Gayle V. Williams, both of Jonesboro.
