        Larry McGill, an advocate for the homeless, died on May 4 at North General Hospital in Manhattan. He was 36 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of kidney failure, said the Coalition for the Homeless, with which he had worked.
        Mr. McGill helped found the Homeless Clients Advisory Committee in 1986, which sought to improve conditions in New York City's shelters and pressed for construction of low-cost housing.
        A native of Manhattan, Mr. McGill had been homeless himself and stayed at several shelters, but in recent years lived in his own apartment on West 129th Street.
        His survivors include a daughter, Lauren, who lives on Long Island.
        A memorial sponsored by the Coaliton for the Homeless will be held tomorrow from 1 to 7 P.M. in City Hall Park.
