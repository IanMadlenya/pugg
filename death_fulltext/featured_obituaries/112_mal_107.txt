        Sim Iness, who won the Olympic gold medal in the discus throw in 1952 and became the first person to surpass 190 feet in the event a year later, died of a heart attack on Thursday in Porterville, Calif. He was 65.
        Iness lettered in track at the University of Southern California in 1950, 1952 and 1953, and the Trojans won the National Collegiate Athletic Association  championship in all three years. He won the N.C.A.A. discus championship in 1952 and 1953 and was a U.S.C. co-captain in 1953.
        It was at the N.C.A.A. championships in 1953 that Iness set his world record of 190 feet 7/8 inches, a week after being hit in the mouth by a stray discus. He won the gold medal in the Olympics at Helsinki, Finland, a year earlier with  a throw of 180-6 5/8. The current world record of 243-0 was set in 1986 by Jurgen Schult of East Germany.
        Iness was a teammate of the 1952 Olympic decathlon champion, Bob Mathias, at  Tulare High in Tulare, Calif., where Iness earned three football letters and three track letters before graduating in 1948.
        At 6 feet 6 inches and 260 pounds, Iness played football and competed in track and field at Compton Junior College before transferring to U.S.C.
        Iness was an assistant football coach at Porterville High from 1955 to 1957,  the head coach there from 1958 to 1966, and the head football coach at Porterville College from 1967 to 1973.
        He then taught at Porterville College and coached track and field there until retiring in 1994.
        He is survived by his wife, Dolores, and two sons, Joe and Dan.
