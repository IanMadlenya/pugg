        Ernest J. Clark, the engineer who designed and supervised the construction of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, the Brooklyn Heights Promenade and several other projects for Robert Moses, died on Wednesday at his home in Somers, N.Y. He was 86 years old.
        He died of cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Clark was a government engineer for about a dozen years and continued in public works as a private consultant for more than four decades.
        Among the projects he worked on were the Cross-Bronx Expressway, the Alexander Hamilton Bridge and parts of the New York State Thruway and Connecticut Turnpike.
        Many of his project assignments originated with Robert Moses, the legendary planner and builder who worked through various New York State, local and autonomous government agencies. Worked on World's Fair
        Mr. Clark was born in Worcester, Mass., and grew up mostly in Yonkers. He graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1928 and earned a master's degree in civil engineering in 1942 at Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, now Polytechnic University.
        His first engineering job was for the Westchester County Park Commission, in the 1920's. In the 1930's he was a structural engineer for the Long Island State Park Commission and New York City Department of Parks, and a bridge engineer for the 1939 World's Fair in Flushing Meadow.
        He joined the W. Earle Andrews firm in Manhattan as a consulting engineer in 1938. In 1945 he became a partner in the expanded firm of Andrews & Clark. He retired in the early 1980's.
        His wife of nearly 62 years, the former Ruth Bohlman, died last year.
        He is survived by a daughter, Jeanne C. Saulnier of Redding, Conn.; a brother, Albert M. Clark of Miami, and three grandsons.
