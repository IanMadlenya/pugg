        Marty Geltman, an ordinary man who faced death in an extraordinary way, with a living funeral in June attended by 200 family members and friends after learning his cancer was terminal, died at home in West Orange, N.J., on Wednesday. He was 65.
        Mr. Geltman taught for 34 years at Springfield Elementary School in Springfield, N.J., and volunteered with organizations including the Mental Health Players of Montclair, the Newark Academy and the Daughters of Israel Nursing Home in West Orange. But while he was a popular figure in life, Mr. Geltman received perhaps his most widespread attention for an occasion just two months before his death.
        He and his second wife, Zella, had heard of a terminally ill woman who had held a living funeral a decade earlier at the Morristown Unitarian Fellowship, where the Geltmans were also parishioners. So on June 23, Mr. Geltman, in a wheelchair, wearing a tuxedo and tennis shoes, and his wife staged what they called a celebration of life in the interdenominational fellowship's airy meeting room. For two mostly boisterous hours, Mr. Geltman's life was celebrated in song, satire and clear and teary-eyed testimonial.
        A more conventional memorial service was held yesterday at the Menorah Chapels in Millburn, N.J.
        Mr. Geltman, who is also survived by two sons, Steven and David, a sister, Harriet Popper, and four grandchildren, explained in an interview how he confronted death so openly, and offered an assurance to others.
        ''I wanted to teach people how to die,'' he said. ''I think I can handle it because I'm committed. It's O.K.; it's really O.K.''
