        Dr. de Silva was appointed chairman of the Trotskyite Lanka Sama Samaja party when it was founded in 1935. The party claims 10,000 members.
        In the early 1970's, Dr. de Silva served as Plantations Minister in the coalition Government of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike before a split in 1975 led to the dismissal of his party from the Government.
