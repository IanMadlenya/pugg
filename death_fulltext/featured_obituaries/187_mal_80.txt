        Peter R. Hunt, a film director and editor who worked on several early James Bond films, died on Aug. 14 at his home in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 77.
        The cause was heart failure, said Nicolas Kourtis, his son.
        Mr. Hunt worked an an editor on the first four James Bond films, beginning in 1962 with ''Dr. No,'' and was the second-unit director on ''You Only Live Twice.''
        He got his chance to direct in 1969 with ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service,'' in which George Lazenby replaced Sean Connery as the suave secret agent.
        The film was the first flop of the Bond franchise, but it remains a favorite of many critics and fans for Mr. Hunt's fast-cut action sequences.
        In a review of the film in The New York Times, A. H. Weiler said that Mr. Lazenby ''plays a decidedly second fiddle to an overabundance of continuous action'' and praised Mr. Hunt's direction. ''The chases are breakneck, devastating affairs,'' the review continued.
        The film was also unusual in that Bond marries his love interest (played by Diana Rigg) but then, just as the two are about to leave on their honeymoon, she is killed in a shoot-out. It remains Bond's only marriage.
        After that movie, Mr. Hunt went on to direct a number of action films, including ''Gold'' and ''Shout at the Devil'' (both starring Roger Moore, a later Bond) and ''Death Hunt,'' starring Charles Bronson, but he never worked on another Bond film.
        Peter Roger Hunt was born in London and served in the British military during World War II, fighting in the battle for Monte Cassino in 1944. After the war he remained in Italy and studied at the University of Rome before returning to England, where he entered the film industry as a crew member and worked his way up through the ranks to editor and director.
        In addition to Mr. Kourtis, he is survived by a brother, Derek Hunt, of British Columbia.
