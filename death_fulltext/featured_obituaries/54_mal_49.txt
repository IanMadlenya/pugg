        Leo Brown, a retired New York State Supreme Court Justice in Queens who had been a government official for New York City and State for nearly 40 years, died on Friday at his retirement home in Pompano Beach, Fla. He was 86 years old.
        He died of a heart ailment, a family spokesman said.
        Mr. Brown was born in Glen Lyon, Pa., grew up in Harlem and graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School, the City College of New York and New York University Law School.
        He was a longtime chairman of the Liberal Party in Queens, but had a reputation as a nonpartisan administrator, having served as an assistant to Thomas E. Dewey while Mr. Dewey, a Republican, was special state anticorruption prosecutor in the 1930's. He also served as an assistant, and then acting, corporation counsel to Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia, and later held the posts of assistant counsel to Gov. Averell A. Harriman, Commissioner of Marine and Aviation under Mayor Robert F. Wagner and Deputy Commissioner of Mass Transit under Mayor John V. Lindsay.
        In 1968, Mr. Brown was elected to the State Supreme Court in the 10th District in Queens as a Liberal with Republican and Democratic endorsements. He retired from the bench in 1978.
        He leaves his wife, the former Naoma Anne Katz, who was a former law school classmate; a son, Stephen, of Oakland, Calif.; a daughter, Barbara Silverberg of Berkeley, Calif; two brothers, Abraham, of Pompano Beach, and Joseph, of Brooklyn, and two grandsons.
