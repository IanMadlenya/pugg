        John M. Leavens, a former executive director of the Citizens Budget Commission, one of New York City's longstanding municipal watchdog groups, died of congestive heart failure while being taken to a hospital in Naples, Fla., last Tuesday. He was 80 years old and lived in Naples.
        Mr. Leavens, a former resident of Summit, N.J., and Martha's Vineyard, Mass., retired in 1971 after almost two decades at the commission, issuing analyses of the city's fiscal issues and appearing before city agencies.
        Over the years he was frequently a critic of municipal budget preparation, warning against ''borrow-now-pay-later'' schemes years before the city's fiscal crisis in the mid-1970's.
        Mr. Leavens was born in Newark. He was a graduate of the University of Vermont and Harvard Law School. He practiced law in New Jersey before serving in the Army Air Corps from 1941 to 1946, rising to the rank of colonel.
        After World War II he became a consultant on government management with the firm of Griffenhagen & Associates and was named executive director of the budget commission, a civic group supported by business concerns, in 1952.
        Mr. Leavens is survived by his wife, Marion; three sons, John M. Jr., of Encino, Calif, Peter, of Newark, Del., and Douglas of, Abidjan, Ivory Coast; a sister, Mrs. Austin P. Winters of Marco Island, Fla.; a brother, William B. Leavens Jr. of West Orange, N.J.; two granddaughters; a grandson, and a great-grandson.
