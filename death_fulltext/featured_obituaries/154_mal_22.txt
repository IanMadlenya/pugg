        Karl M. Waage, a paleontologist and former director of the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University, died on Oct. 18 at Connecticut Hospice in Branford, Conn. He was 83.
        Apart from running the museum and helping to train a generation of geologists and paleontologists in 40 years at Yale, Dr. Waage was chiefly interested in studying the fossil animals in sediments from the sea that stretched from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico 100 million years ago.
        ''He taught his students the classical or traditional approach to sediment layering and paleontology but also encouraged new ideas and inventive thinking,'' said Neil Landman, a former student and now a curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.
        Karl Mensch Waage (pronounced WAH-gee) was born on Dec. 17, 1915, in Philadelphia.
        He received a bachelor's degree in 1939 and a doctorate in 1946, both from Princeton University. He joined the department of geology at Yale in 1946, became a full professor in 1967 and was chairman of the department from 1973 to 1976.
        He was director of the Peabody Museum from 1980 to 1982 and retired in 1986.
        Dr. Waage is survived by his wife, Elizabeth King Waage of North Branford, Conn.; two sons, Jonathan, of Rehoboth, Mass., and Jeffrey, of Windsor, England, and four grandchildren.
        His last manuscript, about the 5,000-year-old fossils from West Haven, Conn., was submitted for publication on Oct. 6.
