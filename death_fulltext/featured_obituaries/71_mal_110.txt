        Lucien Goldschmidt, a dealer in rare and illustrated books, prints and drawings, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 80 years old.
        He died of a viral infection, his family said.
        He was born in Brussels on March 3, 1912, educated at the College Royal Francais in Berlin, worked for Pierre Beres, a rare-book dealer in Paris, and established a New York branch for Beres in 1937. In 1953, he opened his own gallery, at 1117 Madison Avenue, with his wife, Marguerite Studer Goldschmidt. The Goldschmidts retired in 1987.
        The gallery was the first in the United States to exhibit Matisse's portfolio, "Jazz," in 1949 (it sold for $375). Mr. Goldschmidt collaborated with Weston Naef on "The Truthful Lens," a 1980 reference text about books illustrated with original photographs, not reproductions. He helped put together the unpublished correspondence of Toulouse-Lautrec, which he edited with Herbert Schimmel in a volume published in 1969. And he helped organize exhibitions, most recently a show on Redon and Bresdin at the Grolier Club in Manhattan. In an article in The New York Times, John Russell described Mr. Goldschmidt's gallery as "the kind of book-cum-picture shop that Daumier would have liked to draw and in which Baudelaire would have whiled away the hours."
        He is survived by his wife; a daughter, Juliet Goldschmidt Jocher, a jewelry designer in West Redding, Conn.; a son, Nicholas Goldsmith, an architect in Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
