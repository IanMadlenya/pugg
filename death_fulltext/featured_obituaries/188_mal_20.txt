        David Bierk, a Canadian painter, died on Aug. 28 in Peterborough, Ontario. He was 58.
        Mr. Bierk, who was suffering from leukemia, died of pneumonia, said Nancy Hoffman, his New York dealer.
        Mr. Bierk worked in the postmodern genre, in which images and forms appropriated from art history and the mass media are juxtaposed to prompt philosophical reflections on art, modern culture and history.
        He painted copies of works by artists like Vermeer or the Hudson River School painter Frederic Edwin Church, for example, and framed them within broad steel panels, setting up a tension between humanism and old masterly craft on the one hand, and Modernist abstraction and industrial fabrication on the other.
        Most recently, he was working on a series of copies of late floral still lifes by Manet, which he set within steel or concrete frames.
        Born in Appleton, Minn., on June 9, 1944, Mr. Bierk grew up in Lafayette, Calif., near San Francisco.
        In 1972, he received a Master of Fine Arts degree from Humboldt State University, and in the same year he moved to Peterborough to take a teaching job at Kenner Collegiate, a high school.
        Two years later, he founded a successful nonprofit art gallery called Artspace, for which he continued to serve as director until 1987. He became a Canadian citizen in 1978.
        Mr. Bierk's first marriage, to Kathleen Bierk, ended in divorce.
        He is survived by his wife, Liz; eight children, Sebastian Bach of Lincroft, N.J., the former lead singer for the rock group Skid Row; Heather Dylan of Toronto; Lisa Hare of Walnut Creek, Calif.; Zac, Alexander, Jeffrey, Nicholas and Charles, all of Peterborough; and four grandchildren.
