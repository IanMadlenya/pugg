        Daniel E. Willis, a real-estate development executive, died on June 13 at the University of California Mount Zion Hospital in San Francisco. He was 41 and lived in both San Francisco and Manhattan.
        The cause was AIDS-related, Sam Sanchez, his companion, said yesterday.

As one of its officials he worked on the financing and development of such projects as the Marriott Marquis Hotel in Times Square, Theater Row on West 42d Street and the South Street Seaport.
        He was active in the Municipal Arts Society of New York, the Citizens Housing and Planning Council and the Gay Men's Health Crisis.
