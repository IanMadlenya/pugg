        Marjorie Goldwasser Wyler, for many years the producer of ''Eternal Light,'' a weekly radio program on Jewish themes, died July 22 in Norwalk, Conn. She was 86 and lived in Westport, Conn., and Manhattan.
        Working with the late Milton Krents and later with others, Ms. Wyler produced the program, which was broadcast on NBC radio from 1940 to 1985, in her role as director of public relations, radio and television at the Jewish Theological Seminary in Manhattan, where she worked for more than 50 years.
        She was also spokeswoman for the seminary and in 1987 came up with the idea, later adopted by New York City, to name 122nd Street, which divides the Jewish Theological Seminary and Union Theological Seminary, Seminary Row.
        Ms. Wyler is survived by her daughters, Ruth W. Messinger, the former Manhattan borough president, and Dr. Barbara W. Gold of Philadelphia; a brother, Edwin L. Goldwasser; a sister, Joan Schine; five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.
