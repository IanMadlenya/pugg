        Elsa Voelcker, a retired interior designer who worked on several well-known buildings in New York City, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91 and also kept homes in Oakland, N.J., and on Bequia, St. Vincent.
        Miss Voelcker, a native of Manhattan, was an editor of Common Sense, a magazine founded in the 1930's by American leftists, before turning to decorating. In 1938, she became a founding partner in Ann Hatfield Associates, a firm active until the 1960's.
        She was noted for her spare, modern style and worked on interiors at the Museum of Modern Art and the International Arrivals Building at Kennedy International Airport. She also did designs for the headquarters of the Mellon Bank and U.S. Steel in Pittsburgh and the Rockefeller Resort Hotels in the Virgin Islands.
        Miss Voelcker is survived by three cousins and six nieces.
