        John William (Jud) Phillips, a music promoter and a record company executive who ran Sun Records in Memphis with his brother Sam, died on Monday at his home in Memphis. He was 71 years old.
        He died of throat cancer, his brother said.
        From their tiny recording studio at 706 Union Avenue, the Phillips brothers participated in the birth of rock-and-roll, recording such future rock and country superstars as Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Charlie Rich, Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins.
        Mr. Lewis, for example, first worked with the Phillips brothers at Sun, where he recorded a string of rockabilly hits, including "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On" and "Great Balls of Fire." After Mr. Lewis left Sun in 1963 and switched to the larger Mercury label, Jud Phillips became his manager for more than a decade.
        Jud Phillips spent most of his tenure at Sun dealing with the outside forces that helped determine a record's fate.  Sam Phillips said that such songs as "Blue Suede Shoes," "Get Rhythm" and "Breathless" would never have reached a mass audience without his brother's ingenuity as a promoter.
        In addition to his brother Sam, Mr. Phillips is survived by his wife, Dean, and a son, Judson William, both of Memphis; another brother, Horace, of Sheffield, Ala.; two sisters, Mary Haddock and Irene Womble, both of Florence; and a grandson, Judson Bryant Phillips of Short Hills, N.J.
