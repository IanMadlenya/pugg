        Shelley Appleton, a former general secretary of the old garment workers' union, chairman emeritus of the World ORT Union and board president of The New Leader magazine, died on Wednesday at a nursing home in Manhattan. He was 86 and formerly lived in Greenwich Village.
        The death was announced by his family.
        A lawyer by training, Mr. Appleton started out as an organizer for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union and spent 43 years with the union. He served in the Army Air Forces in World War II, based in England, and earned a Bronze Star.
        After his service, he resumed his career as a trade unionist and became one of the union's young stars in an aging hierarchy as well as the son-in-law of the union's legendary leader, David Dubinsky.
        Mr. Appleton was elected a vice president of the union in 1962. He also served as chairman of its international affairs committee and became general secretary-treasurer in 1977. He retired from the I.L.G.W.U. in 1983.
        Mr. Appleton joined Women's American ORT, the Organization for Rehabilitation Through Training, an alliance of Jewish welfare and community agencies, as associate secretary in 1954. He held leading board and committee positions at American ORT and was chairman of World ORT Union from 1980 to 1993.
        In 1986 he also became president of the Tamiment Institute, which supports The New Leader, a magazine covering domestic and international affairs and the arts. At this death he was its board president as well.
        A native of Manhattan, he went through N.Y.U. and its law school in six years, graduating in 1940. He never took the bar examination and instead chose the I.L.G.W.U. for a career.
        Mr. Appleton is survived by his wife of 52 years, Jean Dubinsky Appleton; a daughter, Ryna Appleton of Manhattan; and a granddaughter.
