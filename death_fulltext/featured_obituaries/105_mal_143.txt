        Alpheus Lee Ellis, a banker and philanthropist and one of the richest Americans, died on Sunday in Tarpon Springs, Fla., at the Helen Ellis Memorial Hospital. He was 89.
        Mr. Ellis was the second-largest stockholder in Nationsbank Corporation, the nation's third-largest banking company, which is based in Charlotte, N.C. He owned 6.29 million shares, or a 2.28 percent stake, a bank spokeswoman said. He was also a member of its board and senior chairman of its subsidiary, Nationsbank of Florida. Forbes magazine this month estimated Mr. Ellis's net worth at $490 million, ranking him the 249th richest person in the country.
        A native of Elba, Ala., Mr. Ellis, at the age of 19, came to Florida in 1925 to join a Winter Haven bank. He quickly rose to prominence, and when he was only 32 the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the state banking department invited him to become chief executive of a local bank.
        Starting in the 1950's, Mr. Ellis began buying banks in Florida, putting together an extensive business, the Ellis Banking Corporation, that grew to about 75 branches with assets of $1.6 billion by 1984, when he sold it to the NCNB Corporation, which later became Nationsbank. The secret to his success was "good friends and good credit," Mr. Ellis once said.
        A generous donor to charities, Mr. Ellis gave more than $3 million to the Helen Ellis Memorial Hospital, which is named for his wife, who died in 1989. He was a director of the Children's Home Society of Florida for more than 50 years. He also established a perpetual endowment fund.
        Mr. Ellis is survived by a daughter, two brothers, three granddaughters and three great-grandchildren, the hospital said. The family asked that their names and hometowns be withheld, a funeral home spokeswoman said.
