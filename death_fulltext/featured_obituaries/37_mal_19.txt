        Isidore Halpern, a Brooklyn lawyer who was known as the ''dean of Court Street,'' died of pneumonia on Wednesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 88 years old and lived in Brooklyn.
        Mr. Halpern was a trial lawyer specializing in negligence or personal-injury cases for more than 60 years and his cross-examination techniques were cited in law school textbooks. In his heyday, he was driven to his office near the courts in Brooklyn's Borough Hall in a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce.
        A graduate of New York University Law School, Mr. Halpern was admitted to the bar in 1924. About 40 years ago, he was a founding partner of Halpern, Brown & Darienzo. He was a lecturer on trial techniques at law schools across the country, including those at Yale, Harvard, Columbia and St. John's. Though he retired from his firm in 1976, he continued to be in demand as a consultant.
        He is survived by two nieces and a nephew.
