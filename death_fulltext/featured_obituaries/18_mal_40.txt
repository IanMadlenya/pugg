        Mr. Rehfuss was born in Frankfurt, Germany, but his family moved to Switzerland when he was a child. Both his parents were singers, and his first professional ventures were at the Zurich Opera during World War II. He eventually won two Grands Prix du Disque for his lieder recordings.
        Mr. Rehfuss moved to the United States in 1964 and became a citizen five years later. In a review of a 1967 New York recital, Raymond Ericson of The New York Times referred to the singer's ''dark voice and strong projection.'' Mr. Rehfuss never entirely gave up singing, but his primary work was as a professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo. Part of his estate will go toward establishing grants for young singers seeking further training.
        Mr. Rehfuss's wife, Suze Leal, a singer from Turkey who had been his student, died in 1987. He is survived by a sister, Eva Roger of Paris.
