        Carl Harry Gronquist, a civil engineer who helped design some major bridges in the United States, died on Sunday at Overlook Hospital in Summit, N.J. He was 87 years old and lived in Murray Hill, N.J.
        He died of heart and lung congestion, a family spokesman said.
        Mr. Gronquist, a specialist in bridge design, was a former partner and consultant of Steinman Boynton Gronquist & Birdsall, a consulting engineering firm in Manhattan. He joined the firm in 1927 after graduating from Rutgers University with a degree in civil engineering. He was named a partner in 1960 and was a managing partner from 1971 to 1976. Afterward, he was a consultant to the firm. Some Notable Bridges
        He was one of the principals responsible for the design and construction of the Mackinac Straits Bridge, one of the world's longest single-unit suspension bridges. It connects St. Ignace with Mackinaw City in Michigan. He was also responsible for the design and construction of the Kingston-Rhinecliff Bridge over the Hudson River. He was also involved in work on the Golden Gate Bridge, the Henry Hudson Bridge and the Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge.
        Mr. Gronquist was the author of scores of technical articles on bridge engineering and taught at Rutgers and at Princeton University. He was a member of many professional societies, including the American Society of Civil Engineers, the Transportation Research Board, the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association and the Canadian Society of Civil Engineers.
        In 1944, he was awarded the J. James R. Croes Medal by the American Society of Civil Engineers and an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Rutgers in 1958.
        He is survived by his wife, Marjorie; two sons, Richard, of Bergenfield, N.J., and Robert, of Summit, and two grandchildren.
