        Lord Grey of Naunton, the last official representative of the Queen of England in Northern Ireland, died on Sunday in Naunton, Gloucestershire. He was 89.
        From 1968 to 1973, Lord Grey was Governor of Northern Ireland, the British province. After that the post was abolished and Britain appointed a Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, based in London.
        Although Lord Grey's responsibilities were largely ceremonial, they included a few important duties like formally appointing the Prime Minister and reviewing legislation.
        He previously served as Governor of British Guiana, as Guyana was then known, and later of the Bahamas.
        While previous Governors in Ulster often remained aloof from the workings of government, Lord Grey was known for his diligent examination of proposed legislation and for not being afraid to point out what he regarded as errors.
        Ralph Francis Alnwick Grey was born in Wellington, New Zealand, on April 15, 1910. He was educated at Scotts and Wellington colleges in New Zealand and received a law degree from Auckland University College.
        In 1936 he was accepted by the British Colonial Administrative Service, and the following year was posted to the Eastern Provinces of Nigeria. He rose steadily through the ranks of the Colonial Office, noted especially for his efforts to combat the practice of kidnapping of children and slave trading in Nigeria.
        He was knighted in 1956, and was raised to the peerage as Baron Grey of Naunton, the town in Gloucestershire where he had settled.
        Lord Grey's wife, Esme Kirkcaldie, died in 1996. He is survived by two sons and a daughter.
