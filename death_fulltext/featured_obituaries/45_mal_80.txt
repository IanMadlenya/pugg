        Max Bloom, a retired associate justice of the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court and a founder of the state's Liberal Party, died yesterday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 81 years old and lived in the Riverdale section of the Bronx.
        He died of a neurological disorder, his daughter, Lydia Parnes of Washington, said.
        Justice Bloom was first appointed to the Criminal Court bench in 1962 by Mayor Robert F. Wagner and served there until 1969, when he was elected to the State Supreme Court in the Bronx and Manhattan. In 1979, Gov. Hugh L. Carey appointed him an associate justice of the Appellate Division and he remained there until his retirement in 1986. He was then elected as state vice chairman of the Liberal Party.
        Before he became a judge, he and his wife, Sylvia, were founders of New York's Liberal Party in 1944.
        Justice Bloom attended DeWitt Clinton High School and graduated from Fordham University Law School in 1931.
        In 1972 Justice Bloom issued an injunction barring a group of students and faculty members opposed to the Vietnam War from disrupting classes at Columbia University. But in 1985, he upheld a lower court ruling forbidding Columbia to 'improperly' use the police to break up an anti-apartheid protest on campus.
        Besides his wife and daughter, he is survived by two grandchildren.
