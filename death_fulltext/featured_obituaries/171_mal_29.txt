        Raymond R. Patterson, a poet, writer and professor emeritus of English at City College of the City University of New York, died on April 5. He was 71.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Patterson was the author of ''26 Ways of Looking at a Black Man and Other Poems'' (Award Books, 1969) and ''Elemental Blues'' (Cross-Cultural Communications, 1983) and librettos for two operas by Hale Smith, ''David Walker'' and ''Goree.'' His poetry was included in another composition by Mr. Smith, ''Three Patterson Lyrics,'' which had its world premiere at Alice Tully Hall in 1985.
        His poetry also appeared in publications like Transatlantic Review, Ohio Review and Beloit Poetry Journal, as well as in numerous anthologies including ''The Poetry of the Negro,'' ''New Black Voices,'' ''The Norton Introduction to Literature''  and ''The Best American Poetry of 1996.''
        Mr. Patterson joined the City College faculty in 1968 and was founder of its Langston Hughes Festival, which he directed from 1973 to 1993.
        He is survived by a daughter, Ama Patterson; a sister, Carol Patterson Lewis of Plainfield, N.J.; and two grandchildren.
