        Dr. Robert S. Laufer, a sociologist whose studies of the effects of combat and of captivity led to the development of counseling programs for veterans of the Vietnam War, died of leukemia Tuesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. He was 47 years old and lived in the Riverdale section of the Bronx.
        Dr. Laufer had been a professor of sociology at Brooklyn College since graduating with a Ph.D. from Brandeis University in 1972. He and his wife, Prof. Ellen Frey-Wouters, were co-authors of ''The Legacy of a War: The American Soldier in Vietnam,'' published by the N. E. Sharpe Company in 1986. Their earlier work led to enactment in the 1970's of the Readjustment Counseling Program for Vietnam Veterans. They also did studies of survivors of the Holocaust, veterans of the Israeli army and members of the World War II Dutch resistance.
        He is survived by his wife.
