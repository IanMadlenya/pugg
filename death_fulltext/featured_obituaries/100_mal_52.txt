        R. Gwin Follis, who presided over the Standard Oil Company of California as it grew from a modest regional oil and gas company into the nation's ninth-largest corporation by the time he retired in 1966, died on Monday at his home in San Francisco. He was 93.
        Mr. Follis began his career at Standard Oil of California, now the Chevron Corporation, in 1924, joining the company's refining operations after graduating from Princeton University with a bachelor's degree in physics and geology.
        He rose to become president in 1945, and by 1950 was chairman and chief executive, posts he held for 16 years. Under his leadership, Standard Oil of California acquired the Standard Oil Company (Kentucky), one of many moves that vastly extended the California company's reach across the country.
        A great believer in research as an engine of corporate growth, Mr. Follis also played a commanding role in the establishment of the Chevron Research Company. And as Standard Oil of California's global activities increased, he served as the company's chief envoy, particularly to the Middle East, where he got to know leaders like King Ibn Saud, the founder of Saudi Arabia; his son and successor, King Faisal, and Mohammed Riza Pahlevi, the Shah of Iran.
        Mr. Follis also had leadership roles at several industry organizations, including the American Petroleum Institute and the National Petroleum Council. A connoisseur of Asian art, he helped bring the Avery Brundage Oriental art collection to San Francisco, the city of his birth, and was a trustee of the Asian Art Museum and other fine arts institutes in the city.
        Mr. Follis is survived by his wife, Ann; a son, James Gwin Follis of Philo, Calif.; a daughter, Mary Van Voorhees of Greenbrae, Calif., and three grandchildren.
