        Charles Barrett, an architect who was highly regarded as an architectural draftsman, died on Oct. 19 at Mount Sinai Hospital in Miami. He was 40 and lived in Miami Beach.
        The cause was complications from a liver illness, his family said.
        Mr. Barrett was closely associated with the town planning office of Duany & Plater-Zyberk, Miami architects, although most recently he was in his own practice. He designed the Bayshore Villas in the Coconut Grove section of Miami, among other projects. His drawings were exhibited at many museums and galleries over the years and were published in several books, including ''Building Classical,'' ''The New Urbanism'' and ''Modern Classicisim.''
        Mr. Barrett was a graduate of California State and Yale Universities and worked for Robert A. M. Stern in New York and Allan Greenberg in Washington before moving to Miami. He was also a visiting lecturer at the University of Miami School of Architecture.
        He is survived by his parents, William and Joyce Barrett, and a brother, Randall G., all of Fresno, Calif.
