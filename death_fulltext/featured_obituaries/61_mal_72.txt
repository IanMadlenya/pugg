        Don Gussow, a publisher who founded several trade magazines and wrote four books, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 84 years old.
        He died of natural causes, his family said.
        Mr. Gussow was born in what is now Lithuania and came to the United States in 1920. He grew up in New York City and graduated from New York University.
        In 1944 he founded Candy Industry magazine, the first of 20 business and professional journals in various fields published by his company, Magazines for Industry Inc.
        He sold the operation to Cowles Communications in 1966 and joined Cowles as a member of its board and president of its trade magazine division. But he bought back his business in 1970 and wrote about the experience in his book "Divorce Corporate Style" (Ballantine, 1972).
        In 1982 he sold his company again, to Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, and remained as an officer and editor for several years. Then he started a new company in 1986 and published Franchise magazine until his retirement a few years ago.
        His other books were "The New Merger Game" (Amacom, 1978), "The New Business Journalism" (Harcourt, 1984) and "Chaia Sonia: A Family's Odyssey, Russian Style" (Delacorte, 1980), the story of his family's flight through Poland and Russia to freedom.
        His wife, Betty, died in 1990. He is survived by three sons, Alan, of Congers, N.Y.; Mel, of Manhattan, and Paul, of Brooklyn; three grandchildren, and a brother, Robert of Brooklyn.
