        The Rev. George F. Harkins, a leader in American Lutheranism, died on Tuesday at Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, N.J. He was 78 years old and lived in Wyckoff, N.J.
        He died of complications of emphysema, his family said.
        From 1968 to 1974, Dr. Harkins was secretary of the Lutheran Church in America, the second-highest official of what was then the largest Lutheran body in the United States. He had held the same position with the United Lutheran Church in America, one of four Lutheran groups that merged in 1962 to form the Lutheran Church in America with headquarters in New York City.
        After 1949, Dr. Harkins had been an assistant to the Rev. Franklin Clark Fry who served as president of both the older group and the merged church. Both leaders were viewed as pursuing generally liberal and ecumenical policies.
        From 1974 until 1979, Dr. Harkins was general secretary of the Lutheran Council in the U.S.A., a cooperative agency for several major Lutheran church groups. He was also a member of the governing board of the National Council of Churches.
        He graduated from Gettysburg College and Lutheran Theological Seminary in Gettysburg, Pa. He was pastor of Zion Lutheran Church in Penbrook-Harrisburg, Pa., from 1940 to 1949.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Janet Earhart; two sons, John, of Old Greenwich, Conn., and Paul, of Wyckoff, and one grandchild.
