        Rabbi Jacob Polish, who aided refugees from Nazism, died on Tuesday at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, L.I. He was 78 years old and lived in the Forest Hills, Queens.
        He died of pulmonary failure in the aftermath of a stroke, his family said.
        From 1946 to 1956 he was the rabbi of the Hebrew Tabernacle in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, and then for 15 years he was the rabbi of Temple Isaiah in Forest Hills.
        Rabbi Joseph B. Glaser of the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the national reform group in American Judaism, said the vast majority of Rabbi Polish's congregants at the Hebrew Tabernacle had fled Nazi Germany, "and he was a very important force in making them comfortable and involved American citizens."
        In his long career he was also a chaplain at Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan and at affiliated institutions.
        Rabbi Polish is survived by his wife, Janice; a son, Jonathan, and a daughter, Jamie, both of Queens; two grandchildren, and a brother, Rabbi David Polish, of Evanston, Ill.
