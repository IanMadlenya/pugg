        Dr. Gilbert directed the Bellevue Hospital children's chest service for many years and ran wards for children with tuberculosis. She joined Bellevue in 1934.
        On the wards, doctors tested drugs like promizole and streptomycin that eventually led to the virtual elimination of the disease in children. Dr. Gilbert conducted a 25-year follow-up study that showed the disease's severe long-term effects.
        Dr. Gilbert received her medical degree from the Johns Hopkins University in 1930.
        There are no immediate survivors. Her husband, Webster Aitken, a concert pianist, died in 1981.
