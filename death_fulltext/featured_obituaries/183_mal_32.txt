        Burton G. Tremaine Jr., a business executive who managed his family's large art collection and philanthropic foundation, died last Saturday in New Orleans. He was 79 and lived in Johns Island, Vero Beach, Fla.
        His father and stepmother, Burton G. Tremaine Sr. and Emily Hall Tremaine, amassed a major collection of 20th-century art, including works by Jasper Johns, Piet Mondrian, Picasso, Braque and many American artists. Mr. Tremaine's mother died in 1987, and his father four years later; their collection was sold at auctions in 1988 and 1991.
        Mr. Tremaine graduated from Yale in 1944 and served in the Army during World War II. He worked at the Miller Company, a sheet metal and lighting fixture manufacturer in Meriden, Conn., which his family took over in 1924. He joined the company in 1947 and succeeded his father as president in 1955. In 1987 he became chairman. The company was sold in 2000.
        He was on the board at the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art in Hartford from 1965 to 1985, serving as its president from 1978 to 1981. He was also chairman of the board of Meriden Hospital and the Bar T Bar Ranch in Flagstaff, Ariz.
        In 1991 he became the first chairman of the Emily Hall Tremaine Foundation, which awards grants to support the arts and environmental issues and to raise public awareness about learning disabilities.
        He is survived by his wife, Catherine Burns Tremaine of Vero Beach; two sons, Burton G. Tremaine III of Essex, Conn., and John M. Tremaine of New Canaan, Conn.; a stepson, Atwood Collins III of Darien, Conn.; two daughters, Janet Tremaine Stanley of Tacoma, Wash., and Sarah C. Tremaine of Charlottesville, Va.; a sister, Dorothy Tremaine Hildt, of Palm Beach, Fla., and Gates Mills, Ohio; and 14 grandchildren.
