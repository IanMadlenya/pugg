        Kert Lundell, a set designer for more than 75 Broadway and Off Broadway productions who won three Drama Desk Awards, died on Sept. 11. He was 64 and lived in  Manhattan.
        The cause was lung cancer, said his wife, Bretta.
        Mr. Lundell, whose career spanned four decades, created the set design for Frank Gilroy's ''Contact with the Enemy,'' about two World War II veterans who meet by chance at the Holocaust Museum in Washington, staged at the Ensemble Studio Theater late last year.
        His design was nominated for a Drama Desk Award and was praised in the theater industry journal Back Stage, which said it ''has brilliantly solved the cinematic nature of the play, taking us swiftly to various parts of the museum and finally to a bar in the neighborhood.''
        Mr. Lundell also designed sets for plays by Neil Simon, Arthur Kopit and Gower Champion.
        He taught briefly at Smith College and was a trustee of the Ensemble Theater.
        Mr. Lundell was born in Malmo, Sweden. When he was 15, he and his family moved to the United States and settled in Laguna Beach, Calif. He graduated from the Goodman Theater School in Chicago and studied at the Yale School of Drama from 1959 to 1961. An early marriage ended in divorce.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Erik, and a daughter, Kate, both of Manhattan.
