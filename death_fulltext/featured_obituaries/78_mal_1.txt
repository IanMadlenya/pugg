        Harold A. Opotow, a retired executive and expert in dental materials, died on Sunday at the J.F.K. Medical Center at Lake Worth, Fla. He was 78 and lived in Palm Beach, Fla.
        The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage, his wife, Ruth, said.
        Mr. Opotow was former vice president of ESPE, a West German manufacturer of dental materials, and headed its United States sales company, ESPE-Premier in Norristown, Pa. He retired in 1989 from ESPE-Premier and 1990 from ESPE.
        He was born in New York City. In 1940, he founded the Opotow Dental Manufacturing Company with his father, Nathan, who invented an impression paste used to make dental molds. Mr. Opotow refined the paste and invented other dental materials. He sold the business to Teledyne Inc. in 1969.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by three daughters, Susan, of Manhattan, Fern, of Yellow Springs, Ohio, and Carol, of San Francisco; a sister, Charlotte Abelson of Manhattan, and five grandchildren.
