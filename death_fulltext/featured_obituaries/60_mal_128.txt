        Irving Olan, a longtime leader in the retail and wholesale laundry industry in the New York metropolitan region, died on Jan. 23 at his home in Floral Park, Queens. He was 85 years old.
        He died of heart failure, his family said.
        Born in Russia, he came to the United States at the age of 14 with a brother and sister after they were orphaned. He began working in the laundry business in 1925 and remained active in it until his death. He became president of the Seacrest Linen Supply Company, based in Brooklyn, and also headed the Wholesale Laundry Board of Trade, an industry association.
        Starting with a retail company that picked up and delivered domestic laundry, he expanded into the wholesale processing of laundry picked up by other delivery services. Later he expanded again, supplying rented linen and uniforms and other laundry services for institutions like hotels, restaurants, nursing homes and hospitals.
        He was a 33d-degree Mason and the deputy grandmaster for the New York State Masonic district. For 30 years he was a fund-raiser for the Masons' summer camp for poor girls in Spring Valley, N.Y.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Irene Goldberg; a daughter, Barbara Bernstein of Pomona, N.Y.; two sons, Bernard, of Great Neck, L.I., and Stanley, of Manhattan; six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
