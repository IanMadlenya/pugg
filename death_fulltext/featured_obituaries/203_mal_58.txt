        Charles R. Grean, a pop composer, arranger and music industry executive for more than 60 years, died on Saturday at New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 90 and lived in Weston, Conn.
        Mr. Grean was a copyist for the orchestras of Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw and Charlie Spivak. He arranged the string accompaniment for Nat King Cole's ''The Christmas Song'' and composed the novelty hit ''The Thing,'' which told the story of a man who finds a unnamed object in a box on the beach. Performed by Phil Harris in 1950, it went to No. 1 on the Billboard pop chart.
        Charles Randolph Grean was born Oct. 1, 1913, in New York and grew up in Mount Vernon, N.Y. He began his career playing string bass in dance bands on cruise ships and in Catskill Mountain resorts in the 1930's.
        Mr. Grean became the head of pop artists and repertoire at RCA Victor in 1950. In 1952 he became a partner with Joe Csida, a former Billboard editor and RCA Victor executive, in Csida-Grean Associates, representing Bobby Darin, the radio personality Jim Lowe and the singer Betty Johnson.
        In 1969 he made his first recording with the Charles Randolph Grean Sounde, a musical ensemble, of ''Quentin's Theme,'' featuring music from the TV series ''Dark Shadows.''
        Mr. Grean was married four times. His marriages to Ms. Johnson, Betty Wilmington and Virginia Cronk ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife and their son, Aaron Alexander Grean, of Weston. He is also survived by two daughters from the marriage to Ms. Cronk, Robin Grean, of Stinson Beach, Calif., and Lorin Grean of Santa Barbara, Calif.
        Correction:  December 27, 2003, Saturday  Because of an editing error, an obituary on Thursday about Charles R. Grean, a pop composer and arranger, omitted the name of his wife, who survives him. She is Sherrell Hoffman Grean.
