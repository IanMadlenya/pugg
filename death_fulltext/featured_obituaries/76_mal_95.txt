        Winston Burdett, a radio and television correspondent for CBS News who covered major events in World War II, the Middle East and Washington, died on Wednesday in the Villa Flaminia Clinic in Rome. He was 79 and had lived in Rome since 1956.
        His death followed a long illness, said Tom Goodman, vice president for communications at CBS News in New York.
        Mr. Burdett was based in Rome from 1948 to 1951 and from 1956 until his retirement in 1978. He had begun working for CBS News in 1940. Began in Radio
        He was a radio reporter during his first years at CBS. In the 1950's, after the introduction of television, he began to report on that medium.
        During World War II, he covered the fighting in North Africa, the Allied invasion of southern France and the surrender of German forces in Italy.
        In later years, he traveled widely. He reported on subjects including turmoil in Africa, the Berlin wall crisis of 1961, conflict on Cyprus and the Middle East War of 1967.
        He also reported on Italy and on the deaths, election and installation of popes and other news of the Vatican.
        Mr. Burdett, who was born in Buffalo, received a bachelor's degree from Harvard College in 1933. He worked in New York for the old Brooklyn Daily Eagle. Hired by CBS
        He went to Europe in 1940 as a freelance reporter and began reporting freelance for CBS News that year in Scandinavia. As the war went on, he continued covering it for CBS from various points, and in 1943 he became a CBS News staff correspondent.
        After the war, he reported from the CBS News Washington bureau until he began his first tour of duty in Rome, ending in 1951. He then spent four years in New York, serving as anchorman of the CBS World News Round-Up on the CBS Radio Network and as CBS News's United Nations correspondent.
        In the 1950's, he testified before the United States Senate Internal Security subcommittee that he became a Communist spy after being recruited into the Communist Party in 1937. He quit the party in 1942 after a succession of inconclusive espionage attempts in Finland and elsewhere in Europe. He gave the subcommittee the names of some other journalists whom he said he knew or assumed to have been Communists. A Murrow Protege
        Mr. Burdett was a protege of Edward R. Murrow, and CBS kept him on after Mr. Murrow arranged for him to be removed from the glare of publicity and reassigned to Rome, 1956.
        At his death he was writing a book on the Italian novelist and poet Alessandro Manzoni (1785-1873).
        The prizes he won included an Overseas Press Club Award in 1959 for his reporting about the death of Pope Pius XII in 1958 and the election and installation of his successor, Pope John XXIII, and a Sigma Delta Chi award in 1966 for distinguished service in journalism.
        His first wife, the former Lea Schiavi, died in 1942.
        He is survived by his second wife, the former Giorgina Nathan, to whom he was married in 1945; a daughter, Cristina of Turin; a son, Richard, of London; and four grandchildren.
