        Maurice Sauve, a former Canadian Cabinet member and advocate for the French-speaking residents of Quebec, died on April 13 at his home in Montreal. He was 68 years old and died of cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Sauve, a member of the Liberal Party, was elected to the House of Commons in 1962. Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson appointed him Minister of Forestry in 1964, and his portfolio was expanded to include rural development in 1966.
        Defeated for a nomination in 1968, he turned to business. From 1985 to 1991, he was Chancellor of the University of Ottawa.
        His wife, the former Jeanne Benoit, was a member of Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau's Cabinet and was the first woman to become Speaker of the House of Commons.
        Besides his wife, survivors include his son, Jean-Francois.
