        Lucille Rollins, who managed the career of her husband, Sonny, one of the most celebrated jazz saxophonists, and helped produce his recordings, died on Nov. 27 at her home in Germantown, N.Y. She was 76.
        Her death was announced by Fantasy Records, the parent company of Milestone, the label for which Mr. Rollins has recorded since 1972. A spokeswoman for the company said that Mrs. Rollins had been in poor health since suffering a stroke in February 2003.
        Mrs. Rollins became her husband's manager in 1971 and helped persuade him to resume performing and recording after one of his periodic hiatuses. Long recognized by jazz critics as an important and influential musician, he went on to enjoy a new degree of commercial success, thanks largely to her career guidance. A decade later, when Mr. Rollins began producing his own albums, she became his co-producer.
        Mr. Rollins survives.
