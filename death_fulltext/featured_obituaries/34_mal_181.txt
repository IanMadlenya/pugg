        Max M. Low, a founder of the IPCO Hospital Supply Corporation, died of heart failure Monday at Albert Einstein Hospital. He was 88 years old and lived in Mamaroneck, N.Y.
        Mr. Low assumed control of the IPCO Corporation, originally manufacturers of health-care products and now an optical and dental concern in White Plains, in 1948. In 1959, he founded the Savin Corporation, makers of photocopying machines in Valhalla, N.Y. He became chairman of its executive committee in 1962. The company was later sold to the Canadian Development Corporation. He retired in 1973.
        Mr. Low came to the United States from Austria in 1920 and worked as a clerk in a steamship office, sold real estate and was a junior clerk in a hospital supply house before he and a cousin purchased a hospital supply concern.
        He was a founder of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx and of the Harry S. Truman International Center for the Advancement of Peace at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, where he also founded a hospital named for him and his wife.
        Mr. Low is survived by his wife, the former Evlynne Kirschner; a son, Robert, of Scarsdale; a daughter, Barbara Savin of Mamaroneck, and five grandchildren.
