        Richard D. Bodig, an economist who was also a singer and student of early music, died on May 26 at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 75 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Joyce.
        Mr. Bodig served as economic adviser to the general counsel to the  Mobil Oil Corporation for 30 years, retiring in 1986.
        Mr. Bodig became interested in early music in the 1950's. Fluent in 10 languages, he also translated 16th- and 17th-century manuscripts on performance practice from Italian and German into English, and in 1995 published a collection of Renaissance duets. As a singer, Mr. Bodig performed with Richard Taruskin's Cappella Nova, the Canby Singers and the Dessoff Choir.
        In addition to his wife, who is concert coordinator for the Frick Collection, he is survived by two sons, Christian, of Los Angeles, and Paul, of New York City, and a sister, Alice, also of New York City.
