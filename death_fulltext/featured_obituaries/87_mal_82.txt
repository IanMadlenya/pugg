        Frederick Burr Opper, a retired broadcaster, foreign correspondent and editor, died on Thursday in Norwalk Hospital in Connecticut. A resident of Westport, he was 82.
        He had a brief illness, his family said.
        A native of Manhattan, Mr. Opper, who was known as Fritz, graduated from Amherst College and started his journalistic career with a news service in Washington and a Scripps-Howard newspaper in Toledo, Ohio.
        He went to the Far East to report for United Press and The Japan Times. After Pearl Harbor, the Japanese imprisoned him in Shanghai. He was freed in a prisoner exchange.
        Mr. Opper became the Far East correspondent for ABC after the war and, in 1946, the network's bureau chief in London. He joined Radio Free Europe in 1953 and retired in 1972.
        He is survived by his wife, Katharine Blanchard Opper, and a sister, Nellie Anna Partymiller of York, Pa.
