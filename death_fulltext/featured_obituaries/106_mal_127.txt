        Dr. Frederic Jalton, a politician whom the Paris newspaper Le Monde called the patriarch of the French overseas department of Guadeloupe, in the Caribbean, died last Sunday in his home in Abymes, Guadeloupe. He was 71.
        The cause was cancer, Le Monde reported.
        Dr. Jalton, a general practitioner, was a Socialist for much of his political career and a member of the French National Assembly from 1973 to 1978  and again from 1981 until his death. He was also the Mayor of Abymes for 28 years, until June, and served on the local legislature in Guadeloupe.
