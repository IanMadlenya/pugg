        Michael Scherker, the archivist of Dance Theater of Harlem and a founder of Preserve, the Coalition for Performing Arts Archives, died on Monday at Coney Island Hospital. He was 32 years old.
        A friend and colleague, Leslie Hansen Kopp, said the cause of death was complications from a diabetic coma.
        Mr. Scherker was born in New York City. He was assistant librarian at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum before joining Dance Theater of Harlem. Mr. Scherker founded Preserve in 1987 with Ms. Kopp. The organization encouraged and taught music, theater and dance groups to begin and maintain archival collections. In the last year, Mr. Scherker and Ms. Kopp toured the United States conducting archival workshops organized by Dance U.S.A., a Washington-based dance service organization.
        Mr. Scherker is survived by his parents, Leo and Dorothy, and two brothers, Elliot and Steven, all of Miami.
