        Constantin W. Boldyreff, a Russian emigre who fought Communism as a youth in the Soviet Union and later as a college professor in the United States, died on Tuesday at the Tolstoy Center Nursing Home in Valley Cottage, N.Y. He was 85.
        The son of a general in the White Russian Army who was shot by the Communists in 1932, Mr. Boldyreff fled to Yugoslavia, where he received an engineering degree, managed British-American mining operations, and, by his later account, joined other young Russian emigres in establishing N.T.S., the National Alliance of Russian Solidarists, an underground anti-Communist organization.
        After coming to the United States in 1947, Mr. Boldyreff, who had served with the Royal Yugoslav Army until it capitulated in World War II, told a tale of derring-do in which he twice escaped from the Gestapo and worked as an underground operative in Germany, Poland and occupied Russia to fight both the Nazis and the Communists while saving hundreds of Russians, Poles, Ukranians and Jews from Nazi concentration camps.
        After the war he was credited with organizing thousands of refugees and keeping them out of Soviet hands.
        In the United States he served several years as head of the Russian department at Georgetown University, but lost his job, his daughter, Helen Semler, said, because he refused to give up his political work with N.T.S., which included testifying before Congress in support of American intervention in the Soviet Union.
        He later supported himself by writing and lecturing.
        In addition to his daughter of Silver Spring, Md., he is survived by his wife, Antonia, of Valley Cottage; three grandchildren and one great-grandson.
