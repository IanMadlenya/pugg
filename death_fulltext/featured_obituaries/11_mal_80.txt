        Ralph Nading Hill, a well-known writer and preservationist, died Thursday of a stroke at the Medical Center Hospital of Vermont, in Burlington. He was 70 years old.
        Born and raised in Burlington, Mr. Hill had been an editor of Vermont Life magazine for many years, and at his death was a member of its advisory board. He was also a longtime trustee of the Shelburne Museum.
        He was best known outside of Vermont for the many books he wrote or edited. These include ''The Winooski'' (1949), a history of the state from the time of the Algonquin Indians, a book that was part of the Rivers of America series; ''Contrary Country: A Chronicle of Vermont'' (1950); and ''Sidewheeler Saga'' (1953), based on his experiences operating the sidewheel steamboat, Ticonderoga, on Lake Champlain for three years.
        That book led to Mr. Hill's writing ''Robert Fulton and the Steamboat'' (1954). ''The Doctors Who Conquered Yellow Fever'' (1958), described the efforts of Walter Reed, William Crawford Gorgas and Carlos Juan Finlay. ''Yankee Kingdom'' (1960), the second volume in Harper's Regions of America Series, was a study of Vermont and New Hampshire.
        Mr. Hill was born Sept. 19, 1917, and graduated in 1939 from Dartmouth College, which 25 years later awarded him an honorary Doctor of Letters degree. He edited ''The College on the Hill: A Dartmouth Chronicle,'' and co-edited two books on Vermont life.
        The funeral will take place at the Unitarian Church in Burlington at 2 P.M. on Monday.
