        Robert E. Dallos, a New York-based business reporter for The Los Angeles Times, died on Sunday while on vacation in Budapest. He was 59 years old and lived in Larchmont, N.Y.
        He died of a heart attack, said his mother-in-law, Herta Griffenhagen.
        Mr. Dallos joined The Los Angeles Times 23 years ago. For the last 10 years, he reported on the airline industry. He had also reported for The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and United Press International.
        In 1974, with Ronald L. Soble, Mr. Dallos wrote about computer-manipulated securities fraud at the Equity Funding Corporation in the book, "The Impossible Dream -- The Equity Funding Story: The Fraud of the Century."
        Mr. Dallos is survived by his wife, Carol; two sons, Andrew and Jeffrey, and a daughter, Lisa, all of Larchmont, and his mother, Gertrude Dallos of Manhattan.
