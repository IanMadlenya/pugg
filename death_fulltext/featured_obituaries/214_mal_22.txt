        Basil Thompson, a British dancer who became artistic director of the Milwaukee Ballet and an influential ballet master at the Joffrey Ballet, died in Lynchburg, Va., on Nov. 2. He was 67 and lived in Iowa City, where he taught at the University of Iowa.
        The cause was cardiac arrest, said Winston Barclay, a university spokesman. Mr. Thompson was on a sabbatical from the university, which he joined as professor of dance in 2000. He had gone to the Virginia School of the Arts in Lynchburg to teach for two weeks after restaging ''Petrouchka'' last month for the Joffrey in Chicago.
        Mr. Thompson's expertise in such 20th-century classics was of special value to Robert Joffrey as he made his company a showcase for outstanding revivals from Diaghilev's Ballets Russes and other pre-World War II experimental troupes.
        After dancing with the Sadler's Wells Ballet (now the Royal Ballet) and as a soloist with American Ballet Theater, Mr. Thompson became known as a stickler for classical style in his teaching and coaching. He was the Joffrey's ballet master in New York from 1967 to 1979 and sometimes also performed character roles in ''Petrouchka'' and ''Le Tricorne.''
        In 1981 he joined the Milwaukee Ballet, where he worked for 19 years, first as ballet master and then as interim director from 1986 to 1987 and from 1989 to 1990. He was artistic director from 1995 to 2000.
        Mr. Thompson studied at the Sadler's Wells Ballet School in London and danced with the Covent Garden Opera Ballet before joining the Sadler's Wells troupe in 1955. He left in 1958 and taught in Los Angeles before performing with Ballet Theater from 1960 through September 1966.
        He is survived by his wife, Kitty Carroll; a daughter, Audrey, and a son Colin, both of Iowa City; and a son Edward, of London, by a previous marriage to Alaine Haubert. He is also survived by his brothers, William and Louis, of Newcastle, England.
