        Louis J. Kleinklaus, a retired chief engineer of WQXR and WQXR-FM in New York who helped to shape FM stereo broadcast standards, died last Friday at Fair Oaks Hospital in Fairfax, Va. He was 83 and lived in Manassas, Va.
        He suffered a brief illness, said his stepdaughter, Virginia Heal of Manassas.
        Mr. Kleinklaus was the engineer in 1961 when WQXR-FM, the classical radio station of The New York Times Company, became the first in New York City to broadcast in stereo. The changeover took place under new FM-stereo standards set by the National Stereophonic Radio Committee, on which he served, in 1959 and 1960.
        He joined the Times Company's broadcast unit in 1940 and was chief engineer from 1951 to his retirement.
        He is also survived by two sisters, Fabiola A. Kleinklaus of Kerrville, Tex., and Loretta McGowan of the Bronx, and two stepgrandchildren.
