        Hubert Saal, Newsweek magazine's music and dance critic from 1964 until he retired in 1984, died on Saturday at Roosevelt Hospital. He was 72 and lived in  Manhattan.
        The cause was not immediately clear, said his son, Matthew, who reported that Mr. Saal had collapsed earlier Saturday while on a walk.
        Hubert Saal was known for his strongly held views. In a Newsweek cover story he wrote in 1969 on a fellow Brooklyn native, Beverly Sills, he said that when she was in a Rossini opera at La Scala in Milan, she turned a bravura section of one song "into a Fourth of July fireworks, her voice heated to the point of incandescence, tossing off run after run with perfect intonation."
        Yesterday Jack Kroll, the longtime Newsweek senior editor who is the magazine's theater critic and hired Mr. Saal, said, "He had by far the widest range of any writer on music and dance I've ever known."
        "If you disagreed with Hubie's opinions," Mr. Kroll observed, his unspoken attitude was "a kind of smiling compassion: 'Oh, this poor boob, but I'm going to be nice to him because obviously he can't help himself; he doesn't know that  George Balanchine is the greatest choreographer who ever lived. How sad!' "
        Mr. Saal grew up in Brooklyn and in Florida, attended the University of Florida, served in the Army Air Force, graduated in 1948 from Yale College, and  later studied at the University of Paris and at Columbia University.
        He was a freelance writer, an editor at Town and Country magazine and an instructor at the University of Miami before joining Newsweek.
        His 1955 marriage to Rollene Waterman ended in divorce.
        Besides his son, he is survived by two daughters, Theodora Saal and Drusilla  Saal Belman, both of Manhattan, and a sister, Judith Jick of Boston.
