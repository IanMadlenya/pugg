        Mary Regina Hayford, the ''Little Old Lady from Dubuque'' who helped turn a New York snub into a symbol of pride, died Monday. She was 85 years old.
        Mrs. Hayford worked for 25 years to take advantage of a barb from Harold Ross, editor of The New Yorker magazine, against Midwestern provincialism. In his prospectus for the magazine in 1925, Mr. Ross declared that the publication was not edited ''for the little old lady from Dubuque.''
        Mrs. Hayford began her effort in 1964, at age 60, as part of a Dubuque Chamber of Commerce campaign to fight the city's image. The campaign's organizers decided to use the ''Little Old Lady'' character to counteract Mr. Ross's put-down.
        ''She took it very seriously,'' said Auleen Eberhardt, a longtime friend of Mrs. Hayford. ''She would try her best to give Dubuque publicity as a wonderful town.''
        As Dubuque's representative, Mrs. Hayford was presented with a sequined gown at Sak's Fifth Avenue in New York. She appeared on ''The Tonight Show'' and traveled the country. She spoke of the city's three colleges, its varied industries and its location in a scenic area on the Mississippi River.
        Mrs. Hayford is survived by two daughters, six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
        A funeral is scheduled for Wednesday in Dubuque.
