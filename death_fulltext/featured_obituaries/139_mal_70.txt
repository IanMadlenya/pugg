        Peter H. Kaminer, a litigator who was senior managing partner of the law firm of Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam & Roberts in New York from 1963 to 1983, died Monday at his home on Park Avenue, said Stephen A. Weiner, a partner at the firm. Mr. Kaminer, who was 83 and suffered from terminal cancer, took his own life, associates said.
        For two decades, Mr. Kaminer was an officer or director of the New York Legal Aid Society and in 1980 President Jimmy Carter named him a conciliator of the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes.
        Mr. Kaminer, who was born in Berlin, graduated from Yale Law School in 1939. He lectured on litigation and conflicts of interest at Yale Law School and the Max Planck Institute in Hamburg, Germany.
        He is survived by his son, Stevenson Scott Kaminer, of Washington. His wife, Marie P. Scott, died in 1990.
