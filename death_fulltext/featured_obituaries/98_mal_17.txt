        Roy W. Battenhouse, an Episcopal priest who was professor emeritus of English at Indiana University, died on Feb. 17 at Bloomington Hospital in Bloomington, Ind. He was 82 and lived at the Meadowood Retirement Community in Bloomington.
        The cause was heart failure, said his daughter, Anna Battenhouse of Austin, Tex.
        Professor Battenhouse not only combined two great interests -- literature and religion -- but also argued, against many secular critics, that an understanding of Christianity was essential to understanding Western literature.
        He was author of "Shakespeare Tragedy: Its Art and Christian Premises" (Indiana University Press, 1969) and "Marlowe's 'Tamburlaine': A Study in Renaissance Moral Philosophy" (Vanderbilt University Press, 1941). He was the editor of "Shakespeare's Christian Dimension: An Anthology of Commentaries" (Indiana University Press, 1994).
        Professor Battenhouse, a native of Nevinville, Iowa, graduated from Albion College in 1933 and, at Yale, received a bachelor of divinity degree in 1936 and a doctorate in philosophy in 1938. He was ordained in 1942.
        Before joining the Indiana University faculty in 1950, he taught at Ohio State University, the Vanderbilt University School of Religion and the Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, Mass. He retired in 1982.
        Besides his daughter, he is survived by his wife of 42 years, Marian Gaber Battenhouse, and two brothers, Paul, of Hendersonville, N.C., and Ralph, of Ormond Beach, Fla.
