        Norman D. Erlanger, a retired stockbroker, died on Wednesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 83 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Erlanger died of heart failure, said his son, Michael.
        A native of Chappaqua, N.Y., Mr. Erlanger moved to New York City as a young man and in 1926 became a runner for Asiel & Company, a brokerage house that was founded in the late 1870's. He spent 52 years with the firm, retiring in 1978 as a managing partner.
        Mr. Erlanger is survived by a companion, Patricia Silverman; his son, Michael, of Manhattan; a daughter, Nancy Grayson of Plantation, Fla.; five grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
