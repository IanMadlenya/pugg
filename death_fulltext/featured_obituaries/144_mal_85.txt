        Mark Warren, an award-winning television director, died on Jan. 11 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was 60 and lived in Los Angeles.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Beryl.
        Mr. Warren, who was born in Harrodsburg, Ky., began his television career in Toronto, where he was the producer and director in charge of variety programming for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. When he returned to the United States, one of the shows he directed was ''Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In,'' for which he won an Emmy Award in 1971, becoming the first black director to win the award.
        He went on to direct other television series, including ''The Diahann Carroll Show'' and ''The Burns and Schreiber Comedy Hour,'' as well as episodes of ''Barney Miller,'' ''Sanford and Son'' and ''Dukes of Hazzard'' and a number of television specials.
        He also directed several films, including ''Come Back Charleston Blue'' (1972), with Godfrey Cambridge.
        He was an adjunct professor at the University of Southern California School of Cinema and Television and a special projects instructor for the Directors Guild of America workshop in directing situation comedy.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by his mother, Mary, of Frankfort, Ky.; three sons from a previous marriage, Andre, Christian and Brian, all of Los Angeles; four grandchildren and three step-grandchildren.
