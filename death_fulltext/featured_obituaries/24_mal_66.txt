        Herbert Morrison, who 52 years ago broadcast an emotional description of the crash of the Hindenburg, died early today at a nursing home here. He was 83 years old.
        Mr. Morrison was 31 years old and working for the Chicago radio station WLS on May 6, 1937, when, as the only broadcast reporter present, he described the explosion of the German airship as it approached its landing place in Lakehurst, N.J. Thirty-six of the 97 people aboard died.
        Millions heard his tear-filled account of the explosion and fire and of people falling from the sky. He cried: ''Oh, the humanity! All the passengers! I don't believe it!''
        Mr. Morrison was a native of Scottdale, Pa. He served in the Army Air Forces during World War II and later became the first news director at WTAE-TV in Pittsburgh.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary Jane.
