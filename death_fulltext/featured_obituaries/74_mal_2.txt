        Alexander E. Liepa, the retired editorial director for general religion for Doubleday & Company, died on Sunday at his home in Weston, Conn. He was 78.
        His son, Paul Liepa, said the cause was cancer.
        Mr. Liepa joined Doubleday in 1962 and worked with a diverse group of authors including Billy Graham, Oral Roberts, Dick Gregory and Marjorie Holmes. He also worked with Isaac Bashevis Singer and Bishop James A. Pike, and supervised the scholarly Anchor Bible Series for Doubleday.
        After his retirement from Doubleday he became a resident artist and board member of the Westport Art Center. His work was exhibited in galleries, one-man and juried shows.
        Mr. Liepa was born in Copenhagen and spent his youth in Riga, Latvia. It was there he began a journalism career and reported from Berlin during World War II. He escaped from the Soviet Union in 1945 by posing as an American journalist.
        He came to New York in 1949 and joined the staff of the Lutheran News Bureau.
        In addition to his son Paul of Huntington, L.I., he is survived by his son Erik and his brother, Gunnars, both of New York, and his companion, Anita Diamant of Weston, Conn.
