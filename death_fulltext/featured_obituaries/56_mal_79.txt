        Cyril Chappellet, a senior executive of the Lockheed Corporation for nearly half a century, died Wednesday at his home in Pebble Beach, Calif. He was 85 years old.
        His family declined to give the cause of death.
        In 1932 Mr. Chappellet, then a 26-year-old former Army Air Corps and commercial pilot, pooled his resources with those of six other aviators to buy the bankrupt Lockheed's assets for $40,000. Lockheed, now based in Calabasas, Calif., had been founded by two brothers named Loughead who flew their first aircraft in the San Francisco area in 1913.
        In 1933, Lockheed's first full year of operation, the company earned about $25,000 on sales of about $355,000. Last year Lockheed had net earnings of $355 million on sales of nearly $10 billion.
        Mr. Chappellet, a native of Oakland, Calif., and a 1928 graduate of Stanford University, retired as a senior vice president of Lockheed in 1963. He remained a director until 1978.
        He is survived by his wife, Sybil; two daughters, Claire Chappellet of Big Sur, Calif., and Sybil Chappellet of Maui; a son, Donn, of St. Helena, Calif.; 10 grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
