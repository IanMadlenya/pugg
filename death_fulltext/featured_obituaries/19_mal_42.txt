        Francis Ponge, considered the last of the postwar generation of French poets, died Saturday at his home in Le Bar-sur-Loup, in the Maritime Alps, his family said today. He was 89 years old.
        Mr. Ponge, who was a member of the French Resistance during World War II, gained fame through his ''thing-poetry,'' lengthy, detailed descriptions of objects, published mainly between 1942 and 1967.
        He had lived as a recluse for the last 20 years.
        Mr. Ponge took part in conferences at universities in Italy, Canada and the United States in the 1960's, and was a visiting professor at Columbia University in New York in 1967. He won several international poetry prizes in addition to the French Academy's 1972 grand prize for poetry.
