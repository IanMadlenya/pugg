        Johannes F. C. Holtfreter, a pioneer in the study of embryo development, died last Friday at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester. He was 91 years old and lived in nearby Brighton.
        He died of pneumonia, said a spokeswoman for the University of Rochester, where he taught and directed research from 1946 until his retirement in 1969.
        Dr. Holtfreter devised crucial techniques that advanced embryology as a science. He invented the procedures and a medium, the Holtfreter solution, for growing embryonic cells and tissue outside the body in test tubes, a breakthrough enabling important research.
        He also framed many of the basic issues to be studied: how the nervous system forms, cell differentiation, morphogenetic cell movements and embryonic induction by which cells signal each other. And he helped to discover some of the answers as well.
        "I asked, how do a brain and eyes come about?" he once said. "How and why do cells in an embryo associate and dissociate? And how do all these activities lead to the development of a wondrously complicated organism -- a frog, or a human being?"
        He won Rockefeller, Guggenheim and Fulbright fellowships. His research was financed by grants from the American Philosophical Society, the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Health. He was twice honored by the American Society of Zoologists.
        Dr. Holtfreter was born in Richtenberg, Germany. After earning his doctorate in zoology at the University of Freiburg in 1924, he worked at the University of Munich and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, where Albert Einstein and Max Planck were also researchers.
        Dr. Holtfreter is survived by his wife of 34 years, Dr. Hiroko Ban, an embryologist at the University of Rochester.
