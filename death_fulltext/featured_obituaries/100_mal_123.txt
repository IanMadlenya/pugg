        G. Robert Nail, one of America's leading bridge players, died on Thursday in Houston. He was 70.
        The cause was a heart attack, his wife, Betty, said.
        Mr. Nail reached his peak as a bridge player in 1962 and 1963, when he represented the United States in two world team championships, finishing second twice to the great Italian Blue Team. Both times, the nonplaying captain shifted Mr. Nail to a partner he was not used to. The switch was effective in 1962, but failed in 1963, probably losing the title for the American team.
        Mr. Nail won four national titles: the Vanderbilt Knockout Teams in 1967; the Life Master Pairs in 1974; the Men's Teams in 1965 and the Life Master Men's Pairs in 1974. He was also second on 11 occasions.
        As a theorist, Mr. Nail, along with Robert Stucker, created the Big Diamond bidding system, in which all strong hands open one diamond, and they wrote a book about it in 1965, "Revolution in Bridge." He was the proprietor of a leading Houston club, Nail's Bridge Center, and was active as a bridge teacher.
        Mr. Nail was born in Kansas City, Mo., and suffered all his life from a rare bone disease, osteomyelitis imperfecta.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Nail is survived by a sister, Wilma Carmichael of St. Mills, S.C.
