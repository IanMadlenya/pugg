        Yoshiko Uchida, a writer of children's books about the Japanese-American experience, died on Sunday at the Alta Bates Medical Center in Berkeley, Calif. She was 70 years old and lived in Berkeley.
        She died after a stroke, said her literary agent, Barbara Kouts.
        Ms. Uchida wrote 29 books from 1949 to 1991. They included 27 books for children, a volume of memoirs "Desert Exile: the Uprooting of a Japanese-American Family," which the University of Washington Press published in 1982, and "The Invisible Thread," an autobiography written for teen-agers and published by Julian Messner in 1991.
        "The graceful and lively books of Yoshiko Uchida have drawn on the author's own childhood to document the Japanese-American experience" in fiction for her young audience, Patty Campbell wrote in a review of Ms. Uchida's "Happiest Ending" (Atheneum, 1985) in The New York Times Book Review.
        She was born in Alameda, Calif., to parents who were both born and educated in Japan and then immigrated to California early this century. She was reared in Berkeley and received a B.A.  degree from the University of California at Berkeley and a master's degree in education from Smith College.
        She is survived by a sister, Keiko Kakutani, who lives outside New Haven.
