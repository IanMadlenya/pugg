        John Wilson, an assistant to the science editor of The New York Times and a founding member of the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association, collapsed and died early yesterday at his apartment in Manhattan. He was 56.
        His partner, Richard Poirier, said it appeared that Mr. Wilson had a heart attack or a stroke.
        Mr. Wilson worked as a science editor since joining The Times in 1998. Previously he had been an assistant city editor of The Detroit News and had also held editing positions at The Rockford Register News, in Illinois; The Washington Times; The Miami Herald; and The Sun-Sentinel, in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
        He held membership card No. 4 in the lesbian and gay journalists association. The group's executive director, Pamela Strother, said yesterday that he was one of its leaders, even though he had never held a formal office. A native of West Virginia, Mr. Wilson was a graduate of Marshall University.
        Besides Mr. Poirier, he is survived by his mother, Barbara Wilson, and his brother Rick Wilson, both of Milton, W.Va.
        Correction:  August 30, 2006, Wednesday  An obituary on Saturday about John Wilson, a science editor at The New York Times, misstated the name of a newspaper he worked for earlier in his career. It is The Register Star of Rockford, Ill., not The Register News.
