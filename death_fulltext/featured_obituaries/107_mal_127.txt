        Al Barlick, whose calls of balls and strikes in major league baseball games were among the loudest in umpiring history, died of cardiac arrest at Memorial Medical Center today. He was 80.
        Barlick collapsed at his home in Springfield and died after being taken to the medical center.
        He became a National League umpire in 1940, several years after a coal mining strike forced him to earn extra money umpiring sandlot games. He retired  in 1972 and served as a league consultant for the next 22 years.
        When Barlick was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1989, he was only the sixth umpire to be admitted.
        He is survived by his wife, Jennie, and two daughters.
