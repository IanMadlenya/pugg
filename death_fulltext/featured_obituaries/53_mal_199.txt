        Simon B. Siegel, a former executive vice president in the American Broadcasting Companies and an instrumental figure in the growth of the broadcasting conglomerate, died on Sunday at White Plains Hospital. He was 85 years old and lived in Eastchester, N.Y.
        He died of cancer, a spokeswoman for ABC said.
        He was executive vice president of ABC from 1961 to 1972 and served on the board of directors until 1984.
        He had been with ABC and its predecessor companies for 55 years, starting in 1929 as a $30-a-week auditor with the Paramount Publix Corporation.
        In 1941, he was named assistant to the comptroller of Paramount's theater division and became comptroller in 1949. He continued in that capacity with the newly formed United Paramount Theatres. In 1953 United Paramount and American Broadcasting merged and Mr. Siegel was named treasurer of American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres. In 1957, he was named financial vice president and treasurer of the corporation.
        He was a founder of the Midchester Jewish Center and a former president of United Cerebral Palsy-Westchester.
        He is survived by his wife, Rose; a son, Bernard, of New Haven; a daughter, Irma Hadassah Weissbein of Bridgewater, N.J.; nine grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
