        John W. Christian Jr., a former president of B. Altman & Company, died May 7 at his home in Richmond, Va. He was 74. The cause was a heart aneurysm.
        Born in Durham, N.C., on March 16, 1926, Mr. Christian graduated from Duke University in 1948. He began his retailing career at Thalhimer's, a department store chain in Richmond. In 1960, he became senior vice president and general manager.
        He moved to Akron, Ohio, in 1969 to become president of the M. O'Neil chain. In 1975, he joined Altman.
        ''He was very interested in upgrading our designer presence,'' said Lewis C. Kaufman, who worked with Mr. Christian and succeeded him as president in 1982. ''We were the first American store to have a Versace boutique that featured his creations,'' Mr. Kaufman said.
        In 1984, Mr. Christian became chairman and chief executive of La Vogue Inc., a chain of women's specialty clothing stores. Later, with his son, he founded a records and file management company, Datastor.  Altman closed in December 1989.
        Mr. Christian is survived by his wife of 51 years, Pauline; a son, John W. III of Richmond; a daughter, Anne C. Collins of St. Louis; a sister, Mary Ann C. Rogers of Durham; and four grandchildren.
