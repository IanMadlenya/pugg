        George Francis Kugler Jr., a prominent New Jersey lawyer who was the state's attorney general under Gov. William T. Cahill in the 1970's, died on Sunday at a hospital in Berlin, N.J. He was 79 and lived in Cherry Hill.
        He died after a brief illness, his family said.
        At the time of his death he was counsel to the Haddonfield firm of Archer & Greiner, from which he retired as senior partner four years ago.
        He was the attorney general from 1970 to 1974 in the Republican state government of Governor Cahill. A political unknown at the time of his appointment, he left Trenton and returned to private practice after Mr. Cahill failed to win another term.
        George Kugler was born in Woodbury, N.J. He served on a Navy carrier in the Pacific in World War II before graduating from Temple University in 1950. After he received his law degree from Rutgers University in 1953, he joined the firm of Brown, Connery, Kulp & Wille in Camden County, Mr. Cahill's home base. He soon rose to partner.
        After his stint as attorney general, he was named to various state commissions and committees through the Byrne, Florio and Whitman administrations.
        Mr. Kugler is survived by his wife of 56 years, Gloria Hicks Kugler; four sons, George F. III of Hunt Valley, Md., Robert B. of Haddonfield, Jeffrey R. Sr. of Woodbury and Peter D. of Littleton, Colo.; two sisters, Cordelia Kenney of Wilmington, Del., and Helen Ann Browning of Fort Myers, Fla.; a stepbrother, Robert Neulen of Richmond, Va.; and eight grandchildren.
