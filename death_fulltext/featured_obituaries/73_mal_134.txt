        Malcolm Allen, a general manager and company manager for dozens of Broadway and Off Broadway productions including "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum" and "My Fair Lady," died on Monday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. He was 57.
        The cause of death was lung cancer, said a friend, Les Schecter.
        Mr. Allen was most recently the manager of the Off Broadway show "Ruthless" at the Players Theater in Manhattan.
        He began his career as a child model and actor, making his Broadway acting debut as a teen-ager in "A Young Man's Fancy" at the Plymouth Theater in 1947. He started in theater management working in the box office of the Bucks County Playhouse in New Hope, Pa.
        For more than four decades he served as a manager on many shows, including "Words and Music," "A Touch of the Poet," "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas," "Your Own Thing," "The Me Nobody Knows," "The Ambassador," "Harold and Maude," "A Life" and "Slab Boys."
        There are no immediate survivors.
