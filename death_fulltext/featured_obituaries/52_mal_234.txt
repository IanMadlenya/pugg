        Eugene Lourie, art director for Jean Renoir's films "Grand Illusion" in 1937 and "The Rules of the Game" in 1939, died on Saturday at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in suburban Woodland Hills, Calif. He was 88 years old.
        He died after a stroke, said his daughter, Anita Bigelow of Portland, Ore..
        Also a special-effects specialist, Mr. Lourie was nominated for an Academy Award for the 1969 film "Krakatoa, East of Java." He directed and did the special effects for the 1953 film "The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms." He documented his half-century in Hollywood in the 1985 book "My Work in Films."
        Mr. Lourie was born in Russia in 1903 and went to France in the 1920's. He moved to the United States in 1941.
        In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his wife, Laure.
        Correction:  June 6, 1991, Thursday
        An obituary by The Associated Press last Thursday about Eugene Lourie, a movie art director, misstated his connection with the film "The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms." He directed it; the special effects were by Ray Harryhausen.
