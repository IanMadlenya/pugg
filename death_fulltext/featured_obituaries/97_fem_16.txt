        Ruth Charlton Mitchell Masson, a philanthropist who made large contributions to the Mayo Clinic and to a hospital in her birthplace of Fall River, Mass., died on Feb. 11 at her home in Rochester, Minn. She was 104.
        The cause of death was pneumonia, an official at the Waring Funeral Home in Fall River said.
        Mrs. Masson was a daughter of Earle Perry Charlton, a pioneer in retailing who became one of the five founders of F. W. Woolworth after his 54 stores, E.P. Charlton & Co., were merged with Woolworth in 1912.
        Mrs. Masson attended Chevy Chase College in Washington and married Frederick M. Mitchell, who owned wholesale leather businesses, Mitchell & Pierson Manufacturing and Mitchell & Fletcher Company in Philadelphia. Mrs. Masson and her husband actively supported the former Truesdale Hospital, now the Charlton Memorial Hospital, in Fall River.
        Mr. Mitchell died in 1960. Mrs. Masson later married Dr. James C. Masson, a surgeon at the Mayo Clinic.
        After his death in 1975, she contributed to the Mayo Clinic in honor of her father and her first and second husbands, establishing a James C. Masson Professorship in Surgery. In 1985, the Ruth and Frederick Mitchell Student Center of the Mayo Medical School was dedicated. The Charlton Building, a 200,000-square-foot addition to the Mayo Clinic, was dedicated in her family's honor on Mrs. Masson's 98th birthday in 1989.
        She remained active throughout her life in the Charlton Memorial Hospital, both as a contributor and as a board member. In 1992, the Ruth Charlton Mitchell Therapy Center at the hospital was dedicated in her honor.
        She is survived by two nephews, Earle P. Charlton 2d of Hillsborough, Calif., and Henry C. Lincoln of Swansea, Mass., and a niece, Thelma West of Ione, Calif.
