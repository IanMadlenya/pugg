        Josh Clayton-Felt, a rock singer, guitarist and songwriter, died on Jan. 19 in Los Angeles. He was 32.
        The cause was cancer, said Robert Weide, a friend.
        Mr. Clayton-Felt, who grew up in Boston, took an early interest in music because of the influence of his stepfather, Henry Felt, a folk musician who exposed him to the records of Leadbelly, Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger.
        He moved to Los Angeles and formed the band School of Fish with Michael Ward. Benefiting from the recent success of alternative rock, School of Fish was soon signed to Capitol Records, which released the band's only significant hit, ''Three Strange Days.'' After a second album, ''Human Cannonball,'' the band broke up, in part because Mr. Clayton-Felt wanted to stretch his repertory beyond alternative rock.
        He signed a solo deal with A&M Records, for which he recorded the CD ''Inarticulate Nature Boy,'' playing all the instruments himself. In 1996 Mr. Clayton-Felt toured as an opening act with Tori Amos and released a CD of concert recordings, ''Felt Like Making a Live Record.''  In his spare time as a session musician, he played guitar on the Jewel CD ''Spirit.''
        When Polygram, owner of A&M, was taken over by Seagram in late 1998, Mr. Clayton-Felt was dropped from the label along with 250 other acts. He spent much of last year fighting A&M for the rights to release his second solo album, ''Invisible Tree,'' a set of 14 songs he had spent three years working on. The album never came out.
        In addition to his stepfather, he is survived by his mother, Marilyn Felt, and his father, John Clayton, all of Massachusetts, and a sister, Laura Clayton Baker of Santa Monica, Calif.
