        Robert Horen, an actor in theater, films and television, died on Wednesday at his home in New York City. He was 68.
        The cause was cancer, said Thomas Barbour, a friend.
        Mr. Horen was born in Crespard, S.D., and later moved with his family to Minnesota. He attended the University of Minnesota, did graduate work at the University of Missouri and studied acting with Stella Adler and Sanford Meisner. He appeared on Broadway in "The Great White Hope," "Raisin" and "Borstal Boy."
        He is survived by a brother, John, of St. Louis.
