        Joseph Mruk, a former Mayor of Buffalo and Congressman who took up as his cause the occupation of Poland by the Soviet Union, died on Saturday in the Furgala Nursing Home in Lancaster, N.Y. He was 91 and lived in Cheektowaga, N.Y.
        He health had been in decline for a number of years, said a spokesman for the Melvin J. Sliwinski Funeral Home in Cheektowaga.
        A native of Buffalo, Mr. Mruk, a jeweler, served on its City Council until he won a Congressional seat during World War II. In 1944, he wrote to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, raising questions about Stalin's intentions in the occupation of eastern Poland. His letter brought public assurances of concern for Poland from the President.
        The state Republican Party declined to nominate him for a second term and he lost a campaign as an independent, but in 1947, he was re-elected to the City Council.
        In 1949, when he ran for mayor, he won by a ratio of nearly 5-to-1 in the wards dominated by the city's sizable Polish-American community and gained a record purality. At the time, a mayor could serve only one term.
        He is survived by a sister, Clara Slavin of Cheektowaga.
