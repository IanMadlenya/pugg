        Bernard Ross Morris, a television producer for ABC, CBS and NBC who won five Emmys for public affairs documentaries, died at his home in Short Hills, N.J. He was 61.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Ellen.
        Mr. Morris started his career with The Associated Press in Seattle, covering the proceedings in which Alaska was granted statehood in 1959. He then worked for Time magazine in New York and Chicago for two years.
        For several years he was a freelance producer of public affairs documentaries and news programs. In 1968, he received the Edward R. Murrow Award for outstanding documentary work. He won Emmys for his work in the late 1960's and early 1970's.
        He worked as public information director for the United States Commission on Civil Rights in the late 1970's and then lived for several years with his wife in Paris while working for International Business Machines as a speech writer. He then spent a year as a consultant to the Jamaican Government on the use of television.
        In 1982, he was appointed a commissioner of New Jersey's Public Broadcasting Authority and, shortly before his death, was director of the New Jersey Office of Cable Television.
