        Jerome Machlin, one of America's most prominent directors of bridge tournaments, died on Tuesday in a nursing home near his home in Wheaton, Md. He was 83.
        He had been suffering from congestive heart problems and renal failure, his wife, Trudy, said.
        Mr. Machlin, known as Jerry, worked as a tournament director around the country from 1950 to 1979. He was one of the first six to be named national tournament director by the American Contract Bridge League, and in 1972 reached the top rung, directing his fellow directors.
        In 1980, he wrote a book of recollections, ''Tournament Bridge: An Uncensored Memoir'' (Max Hardy). He also helped organize matches between the House of Representatives and the Senate, and between Congress and the British Parliament.
        Mr. Machlin was born in New York City, graduated from City College and received a master's degree in personnel management from Albany State College. He served in the Navy during World War II.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by two sisters, Eleanor Frederick of Johnstown, N.Y., and Lucille Backer of Boynton Beach, Fla.; four sons, Jack, of Burtonsville, Md., Ken, of Potomac, Md., Richard, of Philadelphia, and Steven, of Binghamton, N.Y., and four grandchildren.
