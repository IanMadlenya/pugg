        William Pflugradt, a conductor, composer and director of the Stonewall Chorale, died on Sunday at the Terence Cardinal Cooke Health Care Center in Manhattan. He was 48 years old.
        He died of AIDS, said his daughter, Brooke Pflugradt of Manhattan.
        For the last four and a half years, Mr. Pflugradt was the conductor of the Stonewall Chorale, the nation's oldest gay and lesbian choral group. It was founded in 1979, and during Mr. Pflugradt's tenure it performed throughout the New York City area to critical acclaim. He also conducted other choral groups, often in his own compositions.
        Mr. Pflugradt was born in Los Angeles and earned a Ph.D. in music theory from Indiana University, where he later taught. He also taught at Indiana State University and the University of Arizona.
        In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his mother, Pauline Pflugradt of St. Joseph, Mo.
