        Sylvan Levin, a pianist and conductor who served as Leopold Stokowski's associate at the Philadelphia Orchestra and the New York City Symphony, died on Saturday at his home in Great Neck, L.I. He was 93.
        Mr. Levin first became known to audiences as a concert pianist, appearing regularly with the Philadelphia Orchestra. In 1932 he was the soloist with that orchestra for the American premiere of the Ravel Piano Concerto in G, with Stokowski conducting. He worked closely with  Stokowski for many years, serving as his assistant conductor.
        Mr. Levin was born in Baltimore. At 12, he won a scholarship to study piano at that city's Peabody Institute of Music. He continued piano and conducting studies at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia, where he later served on the faculty.
        After graduating, he became active in Philadelphia's musical life, conducting the Philadelphia Grand Opera. In 1938, he founded the Philadelphia Opera Company, serving as its artistic director and principal conductor for the next six years. He also founded the York (Pa.) Symphony Orchestra, and introduced outdoor opera to Robin Hood Dell, the summer home of the Philadelphia Orchestra, now called the Mann Music Center.
        In the late 1940's, Mr. Levin became the musical director of WOR radio in New York, and served as  music director for several shows on Broadway and on tour. From 1954 to 1956 he led the European and South American tour of ''Porgy and Bess'' sponsored by the State Department, and the next year he conducted the national road company performances of ''My Fair Lady.'' After retiring from conducting, he returned to the Curtis Institute to teach.
        He is survived by two sisters, Hilda Sprung of East Norwich, L.I., and Edith Denenberg, of Silver Spring, Md.
