        Kurt Weinhold, a former president of Columbia Artists Management, died of emphysema on Friday at St. Clare's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 88 years old.
        Mr. Weinhold represented some of the world's leading classical-music artists and ensembles during a career that spanned a half century. He was born in Dresden, Germany, and came to the United States in 1925 as the representative of Elisabeth Rethberg, a noted Metropolitan Opera soprano.
        Mr. Weinhold joined Columbia Artists as general sales representative in 1935, three years after the company was founded. He rose to become president in 1959 and presided over what was one of the country's largest classical-music management organizations until 1970. The artists he personally managed included Yehudi Menuhin, Birgit Nilsson and Rose Bampton, and he was active in bringing to America such European orchestras as the Berlin Philharmonic and the Bavarian Radio Orchestra. Mr. Weinhold also introduced several choral ensembles, including the Munich Bach Choir and Orchestra, and promoted many young American artists.
        He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, of Manhattan, and a stepsister, Hildegard Haupt, of Heimsheim, West Germany.
