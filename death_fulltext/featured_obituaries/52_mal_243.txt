        Dr. Hans Syz, a psychiatrist and a noted collector of porcelain, died on Wednesday at Norwalk Hospital in Connecticut. He was 96 years old and lived in Greens Farms, Conn.
        He died of heart failure, his family said.
        In 1927 Dr. Syz was a co-founder with Trigant Burrowof of the Lifwynn Foundation, based in Westport, Conn., which conducted early research into group therapies and group dynamics. He resigned in February as the foundation's president.
        Dr. Syz was also known for his outstanding collection of porcelains from Europe and the Far East. In 1963 the collection was transferred to the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American Art, where it is on permanent display. He was co-author of "The Hans Syz Collection, Meissen Porcelain and Hausmalerei," published in 1978 by the Smithsonian.
        Dr. Syz was born in Zurich and studied at the Universities of Zurich, Geneva and Munich before coming to the United States in 1921. He was associated with the Henry Phipps Clinic at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore from 1922 to 1927 and later was with the New York Psychiatric Institute and, from 1930 to 1962, with the Payne Whitney Clinic at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical College.
        Dr. Syz is survived by his wife, the former Emily Burrow, whom he married in 1939; two sons, John, of Greens Farms, and Stephen, of Montpelier, Vt., and four grandchildren.
