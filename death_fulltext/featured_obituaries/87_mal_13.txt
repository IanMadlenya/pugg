        William P. Lynch, a vice president and member of the executive council of the International Longshoremens Association during some of the union's most turbulent times, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 86.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his son, Gerald.
        Mr. Lynch was a union leader of Local 791 in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan during many of the bitter waterfront disputes in the 1950's that presaged the decline of New York as a major port.
        In the aftermath of the bitter 29-day docks strike in 1954, Mr. Lynch was sentenced to three months in jail for criminal contempt of a Federal court order to stop interfering with the movement of goods on the piers. An appeals court overturned the conviction the next year.
        In 1955, Mr. Lynch became a vice president of the international union and remained active in its affairs until his death. For the last two decades he crusaded to goad the city into revitalizing its docks.
        Mr. Lynch is survived by his son, of Oceanside, L.I., and his brother, Dennis, of Long Beach, L.I.
