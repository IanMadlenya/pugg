        Donald Tecumseh (Tee) Carson, who inherited the piano chair from Count Basie after the band leader's health failed, died on Feb. 13 at his home in Cedar Park, Tex. He was 70.
        The cause was lung cancer, said Shirley Cason, his sister.
        In addition to his career as a jazz musician, Mr. Carson was a United States marshal working at the Justice Department on surveillance duty. He retired from the department in 1977.
        In the late 1970's, when Count Basie's health problems began, Mr. Carson started to fill in occasionally as pianist.
        He was something of a Basie protege, having a similarly self-editing, bare-bones rhythmic style.
        When Basie died in 1984, Mr. Carson became the band's pianist, playing in the posthumous Count Basie Orchestra alongside such jazz luminaries as the saxophonist Frank Foster and the longtime Basie guitarist Freddie Green.
        John S. Wilson, writing in The New York Times about a 1985 performance of the Basie orchestra under the direction of Eric Dixon, said that Mr. Carson ''manages to suggest Mr. Basie's manner without adopting it, using single-note lines that are a variant of Mr. Basie's lines, and dropping gentle but propitious chords behind the soloists.''
        In the late 1980's Mr. Carson recorded with the Basie band as well as with the saxophonists Frank Wess and Richie Cole.
        Born in Washington, Mr. Carson  became an electronics engineer at the Federal Aviation Administration in the early 1950's and joined the Army in the mid-50's.
        Leaving the Washington area in the late 70's, he lived in San Francisco for a time, where he played jazz  and was a jazz disc jockey on WCSM.
        In addition to his sister, of Fairfax, Va., Mr. Carson is survived by his wife, Robin LaStofka Carson; two daughters, Ja Don Carson of Las Vegas and Jan Hill of Boise, Idaho; a son, Donald, of Austin, Tex.; and two grandchildren.
