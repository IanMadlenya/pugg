        S. Fraser Sammis, who retired in June as the president of the National Cargo Bureau in Manhattan, died on Wednesday at Huntington Hospital in Huntington, L.I. He was 65.
        The cause was cancer, said his companion, Barbara Fritz.
        Mr. Sammis lived in Huntington. During his 30 years with the bureau, Mr. Sammis helped develop and enforce safety standards for the loading of grain into merchant ships and served on several international associations concerned with marine safety.
        He had also been president of the Board of Commissioners of Pilots of New York State. He graduated from the United States Merchant Marine Academy in 1950.
        In addition to his companion, Mr. Sammis is survived by a brother, Jon, of Wilmington, N.C.; a son, Mark, of Huntington, and a daughter, Kim, of Chicago.
