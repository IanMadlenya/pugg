        Dr. Robert Frank Goldberger, a professor emeritus of biochemistry and molecular biophysics and former provost of Columbia University, died on April 5 at Bellevue Hospital Center. He was 69 and lived in the Riverdale neighborhood of the Bronx.
        The cause was a stroke, his family said.
        As Columbia's provost in the 1980's, Dr. Goldberger was a central figure in the university's efforts to involve its biomedical research in the corporate sector. He helped establish the science and technology development office and the Audubon Research Park, an incubator for small biotech companies that the university operates.
        A native of Manhattan, Dr. Goldberger graduated from Harvard in 1954 with a degree in biochemistry, and received his medical degree at New York University in 1958.
        He carried out and then directed laboratory research at the National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases, rising to section chief by 1966. For much of the 1970's he headed the laboratory of biochemistry of the National Cancer Institute.
        From 1979 to 1981, Dr. Goldberger was the deputy director for science at the National Institutes of Health, responsible for laboratory and clinical research at the country's largest biomedical and behavioral research institution.
        He was appointed provost and vice president for health services by the Columbia trustees in March 1981. At the same time, he became a tenured professor of biochemistry at the College of Physicians and Surgeons.
        As university provost he supervised academic and budget matters and served as acting president in the university president's absence. He left the position in 1989 to work in rehabilitative medicine.
        He is survived by his wife of 43 years, Dr. Marianne Rudolf Goldberger; three daughters; two sisters; and three granddaughters.
