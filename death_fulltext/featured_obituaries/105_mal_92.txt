        Iri Maruki, a painter who won renown for his panels depicting the aftermath of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, died today. He was 94.
        With his wife, Toshi, Mr. Maruki devoted his life to the "Hiroshima Panels."  The 15 panels, painted on Japanese rice paper on a set of folding screens, each 6 1/2 feet high and 23 feet long, offer a surreal view of victims under an  atomic "mushroom cloud."
        Mr. Maruki returned to Hiroshima shortly after the bombing on Aug. 6, 1945.  The artist, who was born in Hiroshima, lost many relatives in the raid, in which 140,000 people were killed. He said his relatives were the inspiration for the panels.
        The murals have been shown in more than 20 countries.
