        Arthur Lord, a television journalist who covered world events for NBC News for more than three decades, died last Wednesday at a hospital in Los Angeles. A resident of Los Angeles, he was 60.
        His family did not disclose a cause of death.
        Mr. Lord produced an Emmy-winning news feature, ''Heart Transplant,'' in 1980. Ten years earlier he was a writer for an Emmy-winning special, ''Apollo to the Moon.''
        He was an on-air war correspondent in South Vietnam and Saigon bureau chief in the 1970's. Later, as a producer, he helped the network in covering the Persian Gulf war.
        A native New Yorker, Arthur Abram Lord was a 1963 journalism graduate of the University of Florida. He was an Air Force captain and information officer before joining NBC as a news writer in 1967.
        He moved to the Burbank, Calif., bureau in 1979. He was a senior producer coordinating coverage of special events from 1982 until his retirement about four years ago.
        Mr. Lord is survived by his wife of 37 years, Susan Tallman Lord; a son, Michael, also of Los Angeles; two daughters, Sharon Lord of Santa Monica, Calif., and Marlene Lord of Houston; and two grandsons.
