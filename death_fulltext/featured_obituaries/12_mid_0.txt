        Molly Berns, an honorary chairwoman of the New York Heart Association for which she had been a principal fund raiser for many years, died Sunday at Mount Sinai Hospital. She was 77 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mrs. Berns, who was born in Brooklyn, directed war bond sales for the American Women's Volunteer Service in World War II before becoming prominent in the association's drives after the war. In the 1970's, the association named her the nation's most successful fund raiser for cardiovascular research.
        She was the widow of Charles A. Berns, a restaurateur and co-founder with Jack Kriendler of the original ''21'' club in 1930. Mr. Berns left the partnership in 1936 to establish, with the help of his wife, 21 Brands, a liquor company. He remained chairman of the company at the time of his death in 1971, shortly after it had become a subsidiary of Foremost-McKesson Inc.
        Much of Mrs. Berns's fund-raising for research into the prevention of heart disease was done as she headed the annual campaigns of the Jack Kriendler Memorial Foundation. The foundation was organized by her husband after his friend and former partner died of heart disease in 1947.
        Mrs. Berns is survived by a son, Anthony, of Manhattan; two daughters, Abby Solomon of Palm Springs, Calif., and Susan Rothchild of Miami; 10 grandchildren, and a great-grandson.
