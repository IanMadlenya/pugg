        In May 1972, Mr. Dothard suffered a grazing gunshot wound to the stomach when Governor Wallace was shot and paralyzed as he campaigned in Laurel, Md., for the Democratic Presidential nomination. One co-worker said Mr. Dothard was ''still barking out orders while on the ground after being shot.''
