        Raymond W. Ketchledge, a retired executive of AT&T-Bell Labs who helped develop the first electronic switching systems for telephones, died of cancer Friday at his home in Englewood, Fla. He was 67 years old.
        For his accomplishments in electronic switching, Mr. Ketchledge and two other men, Amos E. Joel Jr. and William Keister, received the 1976 Alexander Graham Bell Award of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers. The systems, which replaced electromechanical systems, brought the advantages of computer technology to the telephone system.
        Mr. Ketchledge worked for Bell Labs in New Jersey for 40 years until his retirement in 1982 and held 60 patents for inventions in the electronics field. Among other devices, he helped develop a torpedo known as the Mark 24 that was used against German U-boats in World War II.
        He was also involved in the development of a trans-Atlantic telephone cable after World War II.
        He was born in Harrisburg, Pa., and received bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
        He is survived by his wife, Janet; seven sons, Raymond, of Coral Gables, Fla., Bruce, of Oldefield, N.J., David, of Idaho Falls, Idaho, Richard, of Naperville, Ill., Kevin Bell of Staten Island, William Bell of Atlanta and Randy Bell of Chicago; two daughters, Carol Jossem of Honolulu and Robin Heffron of Naperville; two brothers, Edwin, of Syracuse, and Arthur, of Ormond Beach, Fla., and 11 grandchildren.
