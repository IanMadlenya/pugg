        Robert B. Luce, a former editor and publisher of The New Republic who founded his own book publishing house, died on Nov. 29 in Boca Raton, Fla. He was 83.
        He died in a nursing home, his family said. Mr. Luce, known as Bob, began his career working for magazines, taking over at The New Republic in 1963. He edited a book compilation for the magazine's 50th anniversary, which was published in 1964.
        In the early 1960's, he also founded his own general-interest book publishing house, Robert B. Luce Inc., the first of its kind in Washington.
        Mr. Luce left The New Republic in 1966, sold his publishing house and returned to New York City, eventually working for Time-Life Books as director of editorial planning; his family said he was only distantly related to Henry R. Luce, the founder of Time-Life. He also worked for several other organizations, including Metromedia Inc. and Harcourt Brace.
        He moved from New York and began teaching journalism in 1997 at Florida Atlantic University, which he left in 2001.
        Robert Bonner Luce was born in 1922 in Gross Pointe, Mich. He served in the Army Air Forces in World War II and graduated from Antioch College in Ohio with a bachelor's degree in economics in 1946.
