        Joseph R. Cloutier, who presided over extensive renovations and instigated a sharp increase in prize money during his 10 years as president of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, died today at his home. He was 81 years old.
        Mr. Cloutier took over the famous oval and the business empire of which it was a part after the death of his longtime friend and boss, Anton Hulman.
        Mr. Cloutier became treasurer of the speedway when Mr. Hulman purchased the decaying track in 1945 from Eddie Rickenbacker, the World War I flying ace and then-president of American Airlines.
        With Mr. Cloutier as his right-hand man, Mr. Hulman rebuilt the track in time for the race in May 1946. The Indianapolis 500, the only race held at the track, has prospered as the world's richest auto race. It is generally acknowledged also as the largest one-day sporting event in the world with crowds estimated at up to 400,000.
        Mr. Cloutier was named president of the speedway when Mr. Hulman died. He stepped down when John Cooper was appointed president in 1980 but was named president again when Mr. Cooper resigned two years later.
        Mr. Cloutier's wife, Mary Frances, died earlier this year. He is survived by a son, Joseph A. Cloutier; a daughter, Patricia DeWerff; five grandsons and 10 great-grandchildren.
