        John Colman Whitwell, who in 42 years at Princeton University became an expert in applying statistical methods to chemical engineering problems, died Oct. 28 at Applewood, a retirement and nursing home in Freehold, N.J. He was 84.
        The cause of death was complications from a stroke, said his lawyer, Kester Pierson, of Mason, Griffin & Pierson in Princeton, N.J.
        His work helped chemical engineeers to speak with more precision about the results of their experiments and duplicate them more exactly. It was also important in helping manufacturers improve quality control in materials like plastics, petroleum, rubber and industrial chemicals.
        The first graduate student in Princeton's department of chemical engineering, he joined the faculty in 1932 and became professor emeritus of chemical engineering in 1974. He was director of the Medical Center at Princeton Foundation for almost two decades and served as a trustee from 1963 to 1971.
        His wife of 61 years, Blanche Fleming Whitwell, died earlier this year.
