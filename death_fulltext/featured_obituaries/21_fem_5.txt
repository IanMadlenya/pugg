        Cay M. Andersen, a faith healer and co-founder of the Community of Jesus, a residential religious community based in Orleans, Mass., died of heart failure in her sleep on Wednesday at her home in Orleans. She was 75 years old.
        Mrs. Andersen, known in the community as Mother Cay, and Judy H. Sorensen, both lay members of the Episcopal Church, founded the community 30 years ago in an effort to bring about reconciliation among the various Christian denominations and to develop healing as a way of life.
        The ecumenical community of 300 adults and children, as well as 500 nonresident members, includes among its residents 12 members of the clergy from five denominations.
        The community also has become a focal point for religious music, in particular a movement to preserve the Gregorian chant, an ancient form of worship, in collaboration with Benedictine monks and nuns in France.
        Earlier this year Mrs. Andersen and Mrs. Sorensen had an audience with Pope John Paul II in recognition of their spiritual work.
        Mrs. Andersen was born in East Weymouth, Mass., and atttended the Vesper George Art School in Boston.
        She is survived by her husband, John W. Andersen.
