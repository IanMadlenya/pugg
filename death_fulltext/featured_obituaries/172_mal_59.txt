        Andrew Mackenzie Hay, an importer and expert on international trade who was once married to the socialite Sharman Douglas, died in his sleep on May 2 at his home in Portland, Ore. He was 73 and had lived in Portland since 1982.
        He had been ill, but the exact cause of death was unclear, said his wife, Catherine.
        Mr. Hay, the son of a British banker, had become an American citizen, a New Yorker and the president of Calvert Vavasseur & Company, a food importing concern, by 1968, when he married Sharman Douglas, known as ''Charmin' Sharman,'' a well-known friend of Princess Margaret's whose father was Lewis W. Douglas, the American ambassador to Britain in the late 1940's. They were divorced in 1977.
        Mr. Hay was also president of the British-American Chamber of Commerce from 1966 to 1968.
        In 1968, he was named a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II, in recognition of his contributions to British-American trade.
        He went on to become president of an American organization of exporters and importers from 1977 to 1979.
        Mr. Hay was born in London, and he received a master's degree in economics from Cambridge University. He served three years in the British Army as an officer in the Intelligence Corps.
        His earlier marriages, to Jennifer Dimoline and to an author named Louise who still uses the name Hay, also ended in divorce.
        In addition to his wife, the former Catherine Newman, whom he married in 1977, he is survived by a brother, Dr. David, who lives in Hampshire, England; and a nephew, Crispin Hay of London.
