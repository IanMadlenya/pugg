        Louis Peck, a New York State and City legislator for 12 years and a Municipal and Civil Court judge in New York City for 20 more, died of heart disease yesterday at St. Luke's Hospital. He was 82 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        In 1943, Mr. Peck was elected to the first of five successive two-year terms as a State Assemblyman from the Bronx. In 1953, he ran successfully for one of the Bronx seats on the City Council.
        Early in 1956, halfway through his four-year term as a councilman, Mr. Peck was named to a vacant Municipal Court judgeship by Mayor Robert F. Wagner. He was elected to the post late in 1956 and again, as a Civil Court judge, in 1966. He retired in 1975 when he reached the mandatory retirement age of 70.
        During Mr. Peck's years in the Assembly, he was a leading Democratic spokesman on behalf of tenants and in support of the state and city taking over Federal rent controls after World War II.
        As a councilman, in 1954, he made the first proposal in that body that the city's water supply be fluoridated to help prevent tooth decay. In his final year on the Council, he was a leader of an unsuccessful effort to block the razing of the Third Avenue Elevated subway line.
        Mr. Peck was born in New York City and attended De Witt Clinton and Kingston High Schools. Without earning a college degree, he went to law school at St. John's University, from which he graduated in 1928. He practiced private law before embarking on his political career and again after retiring from the bench.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Molly Zwick; two sons, Neil, of Denver, and Gregory, of Atlantic Beach, L.I., and four grandchildren. The funeral will be private.
