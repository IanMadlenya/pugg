        Dr. Harold Louis Israel, who specialized in diseases of the chest, particularly those about which little is known for certain, died on Friday at his home in Philadelphia. He was 87.
        The cause was colon cancer, his family said.
        From the 1950's until his retirement last month Dr. Israel saw patients from throughout the Philadelphia area and published research in  medical journals. In October, he also retired from the faculty of Thomas Jefferson University, where he had taught since 1959.
        He was prominent as a consultant on enigmatic afflictions like sarcoidosis, a disease of unknown origin that forms lesions in the lungs and other organs and is also referred to as Besnier-Boeck-Schaumann syndrome. He contributed to an understanding of its causes and to its medical management.
        A graduate of Amherst College, he earned his medical degree at Jefferson Medical College in 1934. He trained in the epidiomology of tuberculosis at Philadelphia General Hospital and at the Phipps Institute, where scientists from all over the world were brought together to find a cure for TB.
        After spending World War II as an internist in the Army, stationed in England and New Mexico, he went into private practice in Philadelphia. He was chief of pulmonary medicine at Philadelphia General until he joined the Thomas Jefferson staff.
        Dr. Israel is survived by two sons, Stephen, of Baltimore, and Daniel, of Cave Creek, Ariz.; two daughters, Dr. Edith Israel, of Boulder, Colo., and Emily Raphael Greenfield, of Brooklyn; a sister, Dorothy Goldman, of Lincolnwood, Ill.; two stepsons, Dr. Peter Greenspan, of Newton, Mass., and Dr. Ralph Greenspan, of Manhattan; and 10 grandchildren. His first wife of 36 years, Dorothy Harris Israel, died in 1974, and his second wife, Frances Tebet Israel, died this summer.
