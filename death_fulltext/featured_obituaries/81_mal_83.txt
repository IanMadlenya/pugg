        Abraham J. Gellis, former president of Isaac Gellis Inc., whose kosher meats have been a staple at delicatessens for more than a century, died on Sunday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 84.
        He had had a long illness, said Henry Gellis, his son.
        The meat business was started on Essex Street on the Lower East Side in 1872 by Isaac Gellis, Mr. Gellis's grandfather. It supplied kosher salami, bologna, pastrami and other meats to delicatessens in New York and then around the country.
        When Mr. Gellis's father died in the late 1940's, Mr. Gellis left his studies at St. John's School of Law to run the company. He continued in that position until the company was sold to Mogen David Products in 1972, after which he served on the Mogen David board of directors. He also served for more than 40 years as a director of the Merchants Bank of New York.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Mussie Cohen of Manhattan; his son, Henry, of Los Angeles; a daughter, Lynda Guber, also of Los Angeles, and three grandchildren. Another son, Samuel, died in 1981.
