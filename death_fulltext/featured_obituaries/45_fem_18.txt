She was 93 years old and lived in Newport. The cause of death was not disclosed.  Mrs. Firestone was an honorary trustee of the Founders Society Detroit Institute of Arts and was a connoisseur of 18th-century French art. Her collection of rare pieces by early French silversmiths was well known. In 1982 her collection of rare gold and enameled boxes, scented flasks and snuff boxes, including items that once belonged to Louis XV, was sold at auction by Christie's.
        She is survived by two daughters, Martha Ford of Grosse Pointe Shores, Mich., and Anne Ball of Greenwich, Conn.; nine grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.
