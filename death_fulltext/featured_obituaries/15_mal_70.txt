        Lurton Blassingame, a longtime New York literary agent, died in his sleep at his home in Mobile, Ala., last Thursday. He was 84 years old and suffered from liver cancer.
        Mr. Blassingame started his agency in Manhattan in about 1929 and ran it for almost 50 years. During that time he represented such authors as Robert Heinlein, Frank Herbert, John Barth, William Nolan and Gerald Green.
        One of his major successes came from representing ''Chicken Every Sunday'' by Rosemary Taylor, a best seller published in 1943 by McGraw-Hill. The book was also made into a 1948 motion picture starring Dan Dailey and Celeste Holm.
        Margo Fischer, who was executive secretary to Mr. Blassingame for 20 years, said that with the money he made from that book he bought a country house near Peekskill, N.Y., which he named ''Ilikite,'' which he chose to mean ''I like it.''
        ''He was always a thoughtful person with a wonderful sense of humor,'' Ms. Fischer said. ''He was always full of life. He loved fishing, hunting and playing bridge as much as he loved watching opera and ballet.''
        Mr. Blassingame was born in Fort Smith, Ark., on Feb. 10, 1904, and later moved with his family to Auburn, Ala. He graduated from Howard College in Birmingham, Ala., and received a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University in New York.
        Mr. Blassingame, who ran a one-man operation, sold the business in 1979. After the death in 1980 of his wife, the former Kathryn Shaw of Montgomery, Ala., he retired to Florida. In 1984 he moved to Mobile, where his sister lives.
        He is survived by a son, Dr. Lurton Wyatt Blassingame, an associate professor of urban studies at the University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh, and by his sister, Alice Engwall of Mobile.
