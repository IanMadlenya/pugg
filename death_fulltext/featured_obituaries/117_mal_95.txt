        Stefan Bauer-Mengelberg, a mathematician, conductor and lawyer, was found dead last Monday at his home in Amagansett, L.I. He was 69.
        The cause was heart failure, said a friend, Pat Trunzo 3d.
        Although Mr. Bauer-Mengelberg worked for many years as a mathematician for I.B.M., his simultaneous career as a conductor and teacher included many prestigious posts. He was an assistant conductor at the New York Philharmonic under Leonard Bernstein during the 1959-60 season, and returned in later years as guest conductor of the orchestra. He also served as the music director of the St. Louis Philharmonic Orchestra from 1960-62, and as president of the Mannes College of Music from 1966-69.
        His overlapping expertise in computers and music led him to devise a system of musical notation for computers.
        Mr. Bauer-Mengelberg was born in Heidelberg, Germany, in 1927. His family moved to the United States when he was 12. After serving in the Army from 1946-47, he went on to college, receiving a bachelor's degree in philosophy and a master's in mathematics, both from New York University. Later he taught both subjects at a number of schools, including the New School for Social Research and Hunter College.
        When he was 49, already steeped in two full-time careers, Mr. Bauer-Mengelberg decided to study law. He graduated from New York University law school, becoming a full-time lawyer. He continued his law practice up to the time of his death.
        No immediate family members survive.
