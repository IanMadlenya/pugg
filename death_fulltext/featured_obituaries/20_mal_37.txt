        Michael Stone Hooper, a lawyer and advocate for Haitian refugees, died of skin cancer yesterday at the New York University Medical Center. He was 41 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Hooper, an organizer for the United Farm Workers Union in California from 1969 to 1971, received a law degree from Northeastern University in 1980. He then joined the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights in Manhattan, where he was director of research.
        In 1982, he was a founding member of the National Coalition for Haitian Refugees. He became executive director in 1982. Mr. Hooper was an ardent advocate of human rights for Haitians and was involved in bettering their treatment by the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service.
        ''The international community was concerned with human rights in Haiti largely due to the efforts of Mike Hooper,'' said Aryeh Meier, vice chairman of Americas Watch, a human rights group. ''He combined knowledge and love of the country with dedication to the human rights cause. His skilled and effective advocacy will be irreplaceable.''
        Surviving are his wife, Rayna Rapp, and his daughter, Mira, both of Manhattan; his parents, George and Ruth Hooper of North Salem, N.Y., and a brother, Mark, of Chico, Calif.
