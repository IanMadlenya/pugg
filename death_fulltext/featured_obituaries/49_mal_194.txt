        Edmond P. Garvey, the founder and first president of Springfield Technical Community College in Massachusetts, died Sunday at the Holyoke Soldiers Home, a hospital in Holyoke, Mass. He was 86 years old and lived in Springfield.
        He died of congestive heart failure, a family spokesman said.
        Perceiving a need for education programs leading to employment, Mr. Garvey persuaded state and Federal officials when the Springfield Armory closed in 1964 that the former weapons-manufacturing complex should be turned into the state's first technical community college. The two-year coeducational college opened in 1967 with Mr. Garvey as its president, a post he held until retiring in 1974.
        Earlier he had developed a training program for the unemployed in the Springfield area.
        Mr. Garvey, a native of Wilbraham, Mass., served in the Navy in World War II. He was assigned to the graduate school at Harvard University in 1941 and was appointed assistant professor of naval communications at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1943. He left the Navy in 1950 with the rank of captain, after serving as information officer at the United States Naval Academy.
        Mr. Garvey is survived by his wife, the former Mary Gibbons, and a sister, Katherine Garvey of Springfield.
