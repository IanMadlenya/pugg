        Dr. Allan Beigel, a psychiatrist at the University of Arizona who served as an adviser on mental health in the Carter Administration, died on June 22 at his home in Tucson. He was 56. The cause was a brain tumor, his family said.
        Dr. Beigel was a professor of psychiatry with particular interests in mental  health policy, managed care and international policy and education. He joined the university's faculty in 1970 when he was appointed director of the Southern  Arizona Mental Health Center, a position he held until 1983.
        An expert on behavioral health care, criminal psychiatry and drug and alcohol abuse, Dr. Beigel was licensed in five states.
        President Carter named Dr. Beigel to the President's Commission on Mental Health in 1977.
        Born in Hamilton, Ohio, he graduated from Harvard College and earned a medical degree at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in 1965. He was a co-author of "Beneath the Badge: A Story of Police Corruption" (Harper & Row, 1977), a report on a Federal investigation of wrongdoing in Chicago, written with his brother, Herbert Beigel, a member of the panel that conducted the inquiry.
        In addition to his brother, a resident of Manhattan, Dr. Beigel is survived by his wife, Nancy Sher, and twin daughters, Micaela and Eliana, all of Tucson;  and two daughters from an earlier marriage, Jillian, of Chicago, and Jennifer, of Cave Junction, Ore.
