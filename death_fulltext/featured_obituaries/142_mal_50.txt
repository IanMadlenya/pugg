        Minot K. Milliken, who was treasurer and chief financial officer of Milliken & Company, the country's largest privately owned textile company, died at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York on Saturday after a three-month illness, his eldest son, M. K. Milliken, said. He was 82 and lived in New York City.
        Mr. Milliken, who was born in New York City, graduated from Princeton University in 1937 and worked at Milliken & Company for 50 years, until his retirement in 1996. His grandfather, Seth Milliken, founded the company in 1865.
        He had also served on the boards of National Distillers, Mercantile Stores, the Irving Bank of New York and Union Pacific Railroad. He was chairman of the board of the Boys Club of New York for many years.
        In 1979, Mr. Milliken was president of the board of his Manhattan cooperative building, at 19 East 72d Street, when former President Richard M. Nixon sought to buy a nine-room penthouse in the building. Although Mr. Nixon's application was at first unofficially approved by the cooperative's board, many residents objected, complaining that his presence would attract unwelcome attention. In the end, Mr. Milliken announced that Mr. Nixon had withdrawn his application.
        Mr. Milliken is survived by his wife, Armene L., of New York; five children, M. K., of Baltimore, Christopher C., of Lake Forest, Ill., Alexander F., of Santa Fe, N.M., Seth M., of Salisbury, Conn., and Daphne Milliken Webbe of Vail, Colo.; 13 grandchildren, and one great-grandson.
