        Dr. Christopher Chie-Yuan Chen, chairman of the Energy Transportation Group, a shipping company, died on Tuesday at the North Shore Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. Dr. Chen, who lived in Far Hills, N.J., was 73.
        The cause was complications after surgery, said a statement from his sons, Kimball and Kendall Chen.
        Energy Transportation Group, based in Manhattan, operates eight tankers that carry liquefied natural gas between the oil and gas fields in Indonesia and markets in Japan. The company was formed in 1972 and quickly became one of the largest shippers of specialty cargoes, including gas.
        Dr. Chen entered the international shipping business in 1946 and became one of the owners of what was to become the Marine Transport Lines of Secaucus, N.J., one of the world's largest shippers of bulk cargoes. The company operated oil tankers, ore ships, molten sulphur vessels and wine carriers as well as gas transports. He sold his interest in that company in 1970 and formed the Energy Transportation Group two years later.
        Over the years Dr. Chen has also been involved in the Great Lakes shipping trade, ship building in Taiwan and real-estate development in Manhattan.
        Born in Shanghai, he received an engineering degree from Chiao Tung University in 1941 and two years later a doctorate in engineering from Purdue University. During World War II Dr. Chen worked as an engineer in the United States and Britain, where he also studied at the London School of Economics.
        Shortly after World War II he moved to the United States permanently and became an American citizen in 1956.
        Dr. Chen is survived by his wife, Maie Lee Ng Chen of Far Hills, and his sons, Kimball of Manhattan and Kendall of Bedford, N.Y.
