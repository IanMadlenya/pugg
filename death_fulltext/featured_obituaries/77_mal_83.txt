        Milton J. Tatelman, an advertising creator and entertainment critic, died on Friday at his home in Provincetown, Mass. He was 50 and also lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was AIDS-related lymphoma, his family said.
        Mr. Tatelman was the advertising director at Paramount Pictures and later ran his own agency. He created commercials for major films like "2001: A Space Odyssey," "Goodbye, Columbus," "Rocky," "Nashville," "The Longest Yard," "The Godfather" and "Good Morning, Vietnam."
        At the Ogilvy & Mather agency, he helped create a commercial with the slogan "Yahoo, Mountain Dew," that won a Clio award. He also created the ad campaigns for Jordan's furniture stores in New England that featured his brothers, Eliot and Barry, who run the company.
        Under the pen name Newton North, he was a part-time film critic for The New York Post and New York Herald Tribune. There were occasions when he was sharply critical of the same movies for which he wrote promotional advertising.
        He was the entertainment editor of Key magazine from 1978 to 1991. He was on the voting committee for the Tony Awards and was a member of the Outer Critics Circle.
        Mr. Tatelman was born in Newton, Mass. After graduating from Case Western Reserve University, he earned a master's degree in advertising from Bernard Baruch College.
        His survivors include his companion, Stuard Derrick, and his brothers, Eliot, of Sudbury, Mass., and Barry, of Wayland, Mass.
