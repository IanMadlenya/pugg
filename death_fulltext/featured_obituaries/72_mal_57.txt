        Dr. C. David Finley, director of the critical-care units at the Roosevelt Hospital Division of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan, died Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 42.
        He died of complications from lymphoma, said Dr. Gregory Steinberg, administrator of the Department of Medicine at Roosevelt.
        Dr. Finley was also an assistant professor of clinical medicine at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University.
        He was born in Albuquerque, N.M.  He received his medical degree from the State University of New York at Buffalo in 1977, and completed his internship and residency in internal medicine at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx.
        Before joining the Roosevelt staff, he served as a cardiologist and clinical instructor in medicine at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. He held his current position at Roosevelt Hospital since 1983.
        Dr. Finley is survived by a daughter, Lauren.
