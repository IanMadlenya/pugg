He was a co-author with Patricia Conway of ''Ornamentalism: The New Decorativeness in Architecture and Design,'' published in 1983.

        He organized several exhibitions, including a 1980 retrospective at the Bronx Museum of the Arts on the history of the South Bronx. Titled ''Devastation/Resurrection,'' the exhibition dealt with the causes of the area's deterioration and possibilities for its rehabilitation.
        In 1988 Mr. Jensen mounted an exhibition, ''Architectural Art: Affirming the Design Relationship,'' at the American Craft Museum.
        He is survived by his father, Earl, of Kearney, Neb.; a sister, Linda McFarland of Denver, and a brother, William, of Rapid City, S.D.
