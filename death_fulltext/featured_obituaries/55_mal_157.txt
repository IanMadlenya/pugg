        Nicholas Schaffner, the author of several books about the Beatles and a recent biography of the rock group Pink Floyd, died yesterday at Beth Israel Hospital. He was 38 years old, and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of AIDS, his brother, Val, said.
        Mr. Schaffner was born in Manhattan and was a graduate of the Choate School and the New College in Sarasota, Fla. A collector of Beatles memorabilia since his childhood, he began work on his first book, "The Beatles Forever," when he was still in school. A lavishly illustrated and stylishly written account of the band's career, the book was published in 1977. It established Mr. Schaffner as a Beatles expert, and he appeared as a commentator in a video documentary about the group called "The Compleat Beatles."
        In 1980, Mr. Schaffner wrote "The Boys from Liverpool," a children's book about the Beatles, and in 1981 he collaborated with his sister, Elizabeth, on "505 Rock-and-Roll Questions Your Friends Can't Answer." His "British Invasion" followed in 1982, and in 1983 he collaborated with Pete Shotten, a childhood friend of John Lennon's, on "John Lennon in My Life." His most recent book, "A Saucerful of Secrets: The Pink Floyd Odyssey," was published this year.
        Mr. Schaffner also wrote articles for Rolling Stone, Musician and The Village Voice. He also wrote music and poetry and in 1990, he released "Magical Kingdom," a compact disk of his work.
        In addition to his brother Val, of Bridgehampton, L.I., he is survived by his mother, Perdita, and a sister, Elizabeth, both of East Hampton, L.I., and another brother, Timothy, of Tucson, Ariz.
