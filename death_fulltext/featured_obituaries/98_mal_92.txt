        Dr. Robert H. Wylie Jr., a chest surgeon whose skills were called on when Martin Luther King Jr. was stabbed and when Arthur Godfrey had lung cancer, died on Thursday at the Keswick Nursing Home in Baltimore. He was 88.
        Formerly a resident of Sharon, Conn., and Riverdale, the Bronx, Dr. Wylie had lived in Towson, Md., since 1993.
        For 18 years, until his retirement in 1972, he was director of the chest surgery service at Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan and a part-time professor of surgery at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.
        Over the years, Dr. Wylie was a member of the surgical staffs at Bellevue and Harlem hospitals, among others. In 1958, he was summoned to Harlem Hospital as a consultant after Dr. King was stabbed with a steel letter opener by a deranged woman.
        Dr. James S. Todd, the executive vice president of the American Medical Association, was a resident in surgery in 1959 when he watched Dr. Wylie operate on Mr. Godfrey, the television and radio star, at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center.
        Dr. Todd said that chest surgery was still fairly hazardous at the time and that the operation on Mr. Godfrey involved a procedure "that a lesser surgeon would not have attempted."
        Dr. Wylie was also the chief surgeon during an operation at Bellevue on a woman suffering from a potentially fatal aneurysm of her aorta. He removed the distended part of the artery and replaced it with a tube. A Bellevue spokesman said later that it was the first time that so large a section of an aorta had been successfully replaced.
        Dr. Wylie's wife of 58 years, the former Jane Voorhees, died in 1994.
        He is survived by five children, Jane Genth of Riverdale; Robert H. Wylie 3d of San Diego; Dr. John V. Wylie of Olney, Md.; Alexandra Considine of Salisbury, Vt., and Walker Gill Wylie of Baltimore, and eight grandchildren.
