        L. Hudson Leathers, whose career in the commodities business spanned more than six decades, died on Jan. 19 at Centrastate Medical Center in Freehold, N.J. He was 86 and had moved to Freehold from Orange, N.J., after he retired as a first vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers two years ago.
        The cause of death was Lou Gehrig's disease, his family said.
        Mr. Leathers, a native of Greenville, S.C., was an economics graduate of Davidson College with an M.B.A. in finance from Harvard University. He started in the cotton brokerage business in 1936 and joined Hayden Stone, a predecessor of Shearson Lehman, in 1959 as a partner directing the commodities department.
        He was a member and past president of the Commodity Clearing Corporation in New York, and a member of all the New York commodity exchanges as well as exchanges in Winnipeg, Chicago, Kansas City and Minneapolis.
        He is survived by his wife of 60 years, the former Virginia Wilkinson; a son, John H., of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
