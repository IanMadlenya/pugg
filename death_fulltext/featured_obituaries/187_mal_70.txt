        Bernard Canavan, 66, a former president of American Home Products, a major pharmaceutical and health care company, died on Aug. 10 at his home in Jupiter, Fla.
        The cause was heart disease, his family said.
        A native of Scotland, he was a practicing physician in Toronto before joining American Home Products -- now known as Wyeth -- in 1969. He served as its president from 1990 until he retired in 1994.
        He helped the company expand its markets and international research and development. By the time he retired, the company had become a leading maker and marketer of medical supplies and diagnostics, prescription drugs, over-the-counter medicines and food products.
        Dr. Canavan's survivors include his wife, Margaret; a daughter, Helen Stimson; a granddaughter; three sisters; and a brother.
