        Julius Gabris, one of four Roman Catholic bishops in Czechoslovakia, has died, the official Czechoslovak press agency reported Friday. He was 74 years old.
        His death leaves only three of the country's 13 Roman Catholic bishoprics headed by bishops. The three bishops are also reported to be in ill health.
        The state-sanctioned Roman Catholic weekly Katolicke Noviny reported Nov. 8 that Bishop Gabris, of Trnava in Slovakia, was seriously ill. Katolicke Noviny said Bishop Gabris was in Hradec Kralove Hospital, which is known for heart surgery, but the newspaper gave no details about his illness.
