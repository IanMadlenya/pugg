        Vincent L. Pitaro, a lawyer and former New York State official, died on Tuesday at his home in Flushing, Queens. He was 78 years old.
        Mr. Pitaro died of pancreatic cancer, his family said.
        He was a State Assemblyman in 1952 and 1953, serving one term; an assistant to the State Housing Commissioner in 1950 and 1951, and a special assistant State Attorney General in 1958.
        A former president of the Elmhurst Republican Club, he also held other party offices and ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1960.
        Born in Italy, Mr. Pitaro came to the United States as a teen-ager, living at first in Newark. He attended City College in New York and earned a master's degree from St. John's Law School in 1942 and a doctorate from New York University in 1946.
        Soon afterward, he formed a general-practice law firm -- Pitaro, Digangi & Gallagher -- in Forest Hills, Queens. In 1986 the firm moved to Flushing. He had worked at the firm until several weeks ago.
        Mr. Pitaro is survived by his wife, the former E. Carmela Eufemia; three daughters, Claire Lamberti of Shirley, L.I., and Maria and Francesca, both of Astoria; two sons, Eugene, of Flushing and Vincent, of Astoria, and three grandchildren.
