        Rear Adm. Donald John MacDonald, who commanded a destroyer in some of the heaviest sea battles of World War II, died on Jan. 17 at his home in Washington. He was 88.
        Admiral MacDonald retired in 1959 as a rear admiral in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. In his last assignments, he was assistant director of the general planning group and the undersea warfare division.
        A 1931 graduate of the Naval Academy, he was on sea duty and served as a naval aide in the White House and a naval observer in London before World War II. In 1940, he became executive officer on the new destroyer O'Bannon and then her commander in combat in the Solomon Islands in the Pacific.
        He earned two Navy Crosses, three Silver Stars, two Bronze Stars and two awards of the Legion of Merit. The O'Bannon received a Presidential Unit Citation.
        Among his postwar assignments were head of the foreign language department at the Naval Academy and commander of a destroyer squadron. At one time he was skipper of the Presidential yacht Williamsburg.
        After his retirement from the Navy, Admiral MacDonald was a consultant to Fairchild Industries and a stockbroker in the Washington region, retiring again in 1983.
        Surviving are three daughters, Pamela Mertz of Bethesda, Md., Cynthia MacDonald of Arlington, Va., and Sandy Hagerstrom of Naples, Fla.; a brother, Charles, of Fort Walton, Fla., and five grandchildren. His wife, Cecilia vom Rath MacDonald, died in 1994.
