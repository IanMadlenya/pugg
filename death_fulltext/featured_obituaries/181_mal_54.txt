        Matthew McTee Lyon, co-author of a history of the Internet, died on Saturday on a visit to Seattle. He was 45 and lived in Berkeley, Calif.
        Mr. Lyon, an assistant vice chancellor of the University of California, died apparently of a heart attack, the university said.
        He and his wife, Katie Hafner, wrote ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins of the Internet'' (Simon & Schuster). First published in 1996, it remains in print.
        Mr. Lyon was born in Willimantic, Conn. He graduated from Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass.
        He held a number of positions in journalism and was a speechwriter and director of national issues for Representative Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, before joining the University of Texas as an assistant to the president. He was named assistant vice chancellor for public affairs at Berkeley in January 1999, responsible for media and government relations.
        Besides his wife, a reporter for the Circuits section of The New York Times, survivors include their daughter, Zoe; his parents, Richard and Denny McTee Lyon of Austin; and two brothers, Jeremy, of Coos Bay, Ore., and Alexander, of Austin.
