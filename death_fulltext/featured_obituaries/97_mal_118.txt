        Carl Tolman, who in 35 years with Washington University in St. Louis rose from an assistant geology professor to become chancellor, died on Feb. 13 at his home in Kirkwood, Mo. He was 97 and had lived for many years in University City, Mo.
        The cause was complications from a stroke, said his wife, Irene Robertson Tolman.
        After serving in the Canadian Army in World War I, Dr. Tolman joined the Geological Survey of Canada.
        He received an undergraduate degree in geology from the University of British Columbia in 1924. He went on to earn a master's degree in philosophy at Yale University in 1925 and a doctorate in philosophy at Yale in 1927, the year he joined the Washington University faculty.
        In World War II, he interrupted his academic career to work in Washington developing sources for mineral supplies. He returned to the university in 1946 to head the geology department and become dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. In 1954, he was appointed vice chancellor. He became chancellor in 1961 and retired the following year.
        Dr. Tolman then worked for the State Department as a science attache in Tokyo. In 1965 he was transferred to the United Nations to train mining engineers in the Philippines.
        Besides his wife of 67 years, he is survived by two daughters, Lexie Snyder of Severna Park, Md., and Joan Mayer of St. Louis; seven grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.
