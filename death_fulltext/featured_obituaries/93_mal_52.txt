        William S. Youngman, a lawyer once prominent in the insurance industry, died on Monday at his home in Vero Beach, Fla. He was 87.
        The cause was leukemia, said Connie Ruland, assistant to his son Robert.
        For almost two decades starting in 1949, Mr. Youngman was president of C. V. Starr & Company, whose operations included providing management services for the American International groups of insurance companies. He was chairman of two companies in those groups, the American International Assurance Company Ltd., Hong Kong, and the Philippine American Life Insurance Company, in the 1950's and 1960's, and of other insurance companies over the years.
        Mr. Youngman was born in Boston, graduated from Harvard College and Harvard Law School, was law secretary to Judge Learned Hand and practiced law for some years in Boston.
        From 1939 to 1941 he held Government posts in Washington, and from 1941 to 1949 he was a partner in Corcoran & Youngman, a Washington law firm.
        Since 1975, Mr. Youngman had lived in Vero Beach with his companion, Hilde Babin.
        In addition to her and to his son Robert, of Manhattan, Mr. Youngman is survived by his wife, Elsie Perkins Youngman of Manchester, Mass.; another son, William S. 3d, of Nashville; a daughter, Elsie Y. Hull of Washington, and six grandchildren.
