        Laura Branigan, a singer whose high-volume vocals in the disco-style song ''Gloria'' propelled her into pop stardom, died in her sleep Thursday night at her home in East Quogue, N.Y. She was 47.
        The cause was a brain aneurysm, said her brother Mark Branigan.
        After touring as a backup singer with Leonard Cohen, Ms. Branigan released her first album, ''Branigan,'' in 1982. It included ''Gloria,'' which became a hit, lasting on the pop charts for 36 weeks.
        Other hits followed, including ''Solitaire,'' ''How Am I Supposed to Live Without You?'' and ''Self Control,'' although she continued to be most known for ''Gloria,'' her brother said.
        After her husband, Larry Kruteck, died in 1996, she took time off from her music career.
        In 2002, she starred in ''Love, Janis,'' an Off Broadway musical about Janis Joplin. At the time of her death, she was midway through work on new album, Mr. Branigan said.
        Ms. Branigan was born on July 3, 1957, in Westchester County, N.Y. She attended the Academy of Dramatic Arts in Manhattan.
        She is survived by her mother, Kathleen, who lived with her in East Quogue; two brothers, Mark and Billy, both of Manhattan; and a sister, Susan, of Connecticut.
