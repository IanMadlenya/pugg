        Tony Adams, a film and stage producer best known for his enduring collaboration with the director Blake Edwards on ''Victor/Victoria'' and the many returns of the ''Pink Panther,'' died on Saturday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 52 and lived on the Upper West Side.
        The cause was a stroke, said his spokesman, Peter Cromarty.
        On Broadway, the Dublin-born Mr. Adams established himself as the producer of ''Victor/Victoria,'' starring Julie Andrews, Mr. Edwards's wife. The musical comedy, an Edwards-Adams production, opened in October 1995 and ran for 734 performances before closing in mid-summer 1997.
        Mr. Adams was in his teens when he worked as an assistant on location in Georgia at the filming of ''Deliverance'' (1972). One of the stars, Burt Reynolds, helped him get a job in Florida, allowing Mr. Adams to stay in the United States and study at Atlantic College in Palm Beach. Later, attending Pepperdine University, he met Mr. Edwards and Ms. Andrews.
        Mr. Adams produced the film version of ''Victor/Victoria'' (1982) with Ms. Andrews, James Garner and Robert Preston. He produced ''10'' (1979) with Dudley Moore and Bo Derek; ''S.O.B.'' (1981) with William Holden and Shelley Winters; and ''The Man Who Loved Women'' (1983) with Kim Basinger and Mr. Reynolds.
        More recent among his nearly two dozen movie and television productions were ''Switch'' (1991) with Ellen Barkin and Jimmy Smits; and, for PBS, ''My Favorite Broadway'' and ''The Lullaby of Broadway'' (both of 2001).
        Mr. Adams is survived by his wife, Anne Runolfsson, a Broadway actress; two daughters, Molly Adams of Santa Monica, Calif., and Tess Adams of Manhattan; two sons, Andrew Hopewell of Malibu, Calif., and Alister Adams, of Toronto; as well as seven siblings in Ireland, England and Los Angeles. His two earlier marriages, to Avril Adams and Debrah Farentino, ended in divorce.
