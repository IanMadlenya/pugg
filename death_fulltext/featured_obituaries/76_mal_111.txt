        Dr. Warren Anthony Lapp, who practiced obstetrics and gynecology in Brooklyn for 35 years, died on Thursday at his home in Charlotte, N.C. He was 78 and had moved to North Carolina after his retirement in 1981.
        He had a long illness, his family said.
        Dr. Lapp was born in Chicago Heights, Ill., and grew up in Norwood, Ohio. He graduated from Ohio State University, where he also received his medical degree. As a major in the Army, he served as personal physician to Gen. George S. Patton until the general's death in Heidelberg in December 1945.
        During his Brooklyn years, he was chairman of the obstetrics and gynecology department at St. John's Episcopal Hospital, which became part of Interfaith Medical Center, and interim chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center. He was a past president of the Kings County Medical Society and a founder of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology.
        An amateur numismatist, Dr. Lapp was an expert on United States coins. He helped found the Early American Coppers Society and regularly contributed to "A Guidebook of United States Coins," the standard reference book by R. S. Yoeman.
        Dr. Lapp is survived by his wife, the former Katherine Beard; two sons, Dr. Charles W. of Charlotte, and Robert L. of Winter Springs, Fla.; a sister, Dorothy Kaisrlik of Sarasota, Fla., and five grandchildren.
