        Kiel Martin, who played the wheeler-dealer detective J. D. LaRue on the television series "Hill Street Blues," died here on Friday. He was 46 years old.
        Mr. Martin died of cardiovascular collapse caused by lung cancer, said Michael Werk, a Riverside County deputy coroner.
        Mr. Martin, who worked at different times as a musician, stand-up comedian and soap-opera actor, was best known for his portrayal of LaRue, who tried to interest his fellow officers in get-rich-quick schemes that invariably failed.
        He said the character grew out of conversations he had with many real-life police officers.
        Mr. Martin's acting career began when his father urged him to try out for a bit part in a high school production of "Finian's Rainbow." That led to repertory theater work in Florida, where he grew up.
        He was a regular on the daytime drama "The Edge of Night" before joining "Hill Street Blues." After "Hill Street" left the air in 1987, he appeared briefly as a dead man given a new shot at life in "Second Chance," a short-lived Fox television series.
        His film credits included "The Panic in Needle Park" in 1971 and "The Lolly-Madonna War" in 1973.
