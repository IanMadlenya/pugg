        Alfredo Bojalil Gil, whose mellifluous guitar added honey to the sweet sound of the Latin trio Los Panchos, died on Friday at his Mexico City home. He was 84.
        Mr. Gil, who was known by his nickname, El Guero, which means fair-haired in Mexican Spanish, was the last surviving member of the singing group.
        He was born on Jan. 5, 1915, into a musical family in a musical land, the Gulf state of Veracruz. But to find recognition he had to travel to New York and its Latin nightclubs. On May 14, 1944, the trio made its debut with Mr. Gil on guitar and another Mexican, Jesus Navarro, known as Chucho, singing harmonies. The heart-melting lead voice belonged a tenor from Puerto Rico, Hernando Aviles.
        Mr. Gil said they agreed to call the group Trio Los Panchos after the Mexican revolutionary, Pancho Villa, who they assumed would be well-known outside of Mexico.
        Crooning songs like ''Sin Ti,'' which means ''Without You,'' ''Sin un Amor'' (''Without a Love'') and ''Quizas, Quizas, Quizas'' (''Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps''), the trio made the sound of the bolero familiar to romantics worldwide. Mr. Gil composed many of the songs the group performed.
        To lighten and smooth the group's sound, Mr. Gil chose to play a small guitar with a pleasing hum, a requinto. The instrument he pioneered became essential for romantic troubadour trios.
        Los Panchos made more than 300 records, including a number of songs with the American singer Eydie Gorme, and appeared in some 50 Mexican films. Their recordings have continued to sell tens of thousands of copies each year. While the lead singer frequently changed, Mr. Gil remained with the group until he retired in 1981.
        Mr. Gil is survived by his wife, Maria Guadalupe Bedoy de Bojalil, and five children.
