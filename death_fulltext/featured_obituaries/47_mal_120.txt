        Chang Chun, a former Prime Minister of Nationalist China and a presidential adviser who helped influence Taiwan's foreign policy for decades, has died of heart and kidney failure, a hospital reported. He was 101 years old.
        Mr. Chang, who died Friday, entered the Veterans General Hospital on Monday for treatment of heart and kidney ailments that were complicated by flu, a hospital spokesman reported today.
        Mr. Chang was the last surviving elder of the governing Nationalist Party who had joined Sun Yat-sen in the revolution in China that led to the overthrow of the Qing dynasty in 1911.
        Mr. Chang was a classmate of Chiang Kai-shek at the Tokyo Military Academy in Japan. He later served as Chiang's top aide in battles against warlords and Communist forces on the Chinese mainland. He was the Nationalist Government's Prime Minister in 1947 and 1948.
        On Taiwan, he served as Chiang's chief of staff and adviser until the President's death in 1975, and played an influential role in mapping the Government's foreign policy. He also served as an adviser to Chiang's son, former President Chiang Ching-kuo.
        Mr. Chang is survived by two sons, Chi-cheng, an adviser to President Lee Teng-hui, and Chi-chung.
