        Prince Hassan Aziz Hassan, a cousin of the last king of Egypt and a great-grandson of the Khedive Ismail, who built modern Cairo and the Suez Canal, died here on Sunday. He was 76.
        One of the few surviving members of the Mohammed Ali dynasty, Prince Hassan lived in obscurity in the country that his family ruled from 1803 until the 1952 revolution.  He was a pianist and an artist, although he was not permitted to exhibit his work.
        After King Farouk was deposed in a coup led by Gamal Abdel Nasser, Prince Hassan did not flee with the rest of his family. He pursued his art in Cairo, selling to collectors in Europe and the United States and staying out of politics.
        His father, Prince Aziz, was a founder of the Wafd Party, which fought British colonial rule. In a sign of taboos that persist on news of the Mohammed Ali dynasty, Prince Hassan's death was noted in the Egyptian press only with a brief mention in the Wafd newspaper.
        Prince Hassan had recently completed a memoir, ''In the House of Mohammed Ali: A Family Album,'' which the American University of Cairo Press will publish.
        Surviving are two sisters, Princess Khadijah of Cairo and Princess Aicha, who lives in Turkey.
