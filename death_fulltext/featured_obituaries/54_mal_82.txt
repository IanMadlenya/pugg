        A. Courtenay Shepard, former corporate vice president and president of Colgate-Palmolive's Canadian subsidiary, died on Wednesday at his home in Westport, Conn. He was 52 years old.
        Mr. Shepard died of lung cancer, a spokeswoman for the family said.
        He joined Colgate-Palmolive in 1973 and worked as director of marketing for the household products division before going overseas.
        In 1978 he was appointed assistant general manager of the German operations, and the following year was named president of Colgate-Palmolive of Canada.
        Mr. Shepard is survived by his wife, the former Belinda Kirby; three sons, David, of San Francisco, Scott, of Bloomington, Ind., and Andrew, of Manhattan, and his parents, Donald and Suzanne Shepard of Kennebunk, Me.
        Correction:  July 13, 1991, Saturday
        Because of an editing error, an obituary yesterday about A. Courtenay Shepard, a former Colgate-Palmolive executive, omitted one of his titles with the company. He was a former president of both Colgate U.S. and Colgate-Palmolive Canada.
