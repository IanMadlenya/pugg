        Chesley Peterson, a retired Air Force major general who was the United States Air Force's youngest colonel, died Sunday in Riverside, Calif. He was 69 years old.
        In 1940 General Peterson joined the Royal Air Force's Eagle Squadron, a group of foreign volunteers. Flying Hawker Hurricanes and Supermarine Spitfires in battles with the Luftwaffe, he advanced to colonel at the age of 23.
        He kept the rank when he moved to the United States Army Air Corps to fly P-47 Thunderbolts in 1943. He remains the Air Force's youngest colonel. In more than 200 combat missions he claimed nine kills and nine probable kills.
        Airman magazine said he was the only American fighter pilot to win both the United States Distinguished Service Cross and Britain's Distinguished Service Order.
