        Dr. Eric Werner, a musicologist and an authority on sacred music, died of heart failure Thursday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Dr. Werner, who was born in Vienna and educated in Europe, was the founder of the School of Sacred Music of Hebrew Union College at the Jewish Institute of Religion in Manhattan, where he was professor of liturgical music from 1939 to 1967. He also set up the musicology department at Tel Aviv University in Israel and was its chairman from 1966 to 1971.
        He was internationally known for his knowledge of sacred music and wrote 10 books on the subject, including ''The Sacred Bridge,'' the standard text on Jewish and early Christian liturgical music and their interrelationship, published by Columbia University Press in 1959.
        Dr. Werner is survived by his wife, Elisabeth, of Manhattan.
