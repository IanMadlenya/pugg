        Milton P. Siegel, a former assistant director-general of the World Health Organization, died on Sunday at his home in Houston. He was 84.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        Most recently, Mr. Siegel was a professor of international health at the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston. He joined the faculty in 1971 and achieved emeritus status six years ago.
        Born in Des Moines, Mr. Siegel was an official of the Iowa Emergency Relief Administration and the Iowa Rural Rehabilitation Administration before joining the United States Department of Agriculture in 1935 as a financial and business  manager for the Farm Security Administration. Still associated with the department, he was involved in the planning stages for the World Health Organization in New York. He took the post of assistant director-general in Geneva in 1947 and served until 1971, specializing in finances and administration.
        Mr. Siegel is survived by a daughter, Betsy Siegel of Houston, and two grandchildren. His wife of 57 years, Rosalie Rosenberg Siegel, died in 1991.
