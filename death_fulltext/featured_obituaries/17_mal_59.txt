        Irwin Winston, the founder of what became the nation's leading transportation advertising company, Winston Network Inc., died of degenerative heart failure Thursday at the Miami Heart Institute. He was 77 years old and lived in Hollywood, Fla.
        Mr. Winston acquired his first bus advertising franchise in 1950 in Sarasota, Fla. By 1961, his company was in 35 cities, and by 1966, in 50 cities. In 1971, the year he took his company public, Mr. Winston was elected to the Transit Advertising Hall of Fame.
        By 1975, with the acquisition of 35-year-old Transportation Displays Inc. from the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation, the company had become the leader in its field and changed its name to TDI Winston Network.
        Over the years, with Mr. Winston serving as chairman and chief executive, the company extended its display advertising from buses and bus shelters to airports, subways, and commuter railroads and stations. In December 1986, Mr. Winston and his three sons, two of whom worked for the company, sold their interests, and he retired.
        He is survived by his wife, Lillian, and three sons, Fredrick, of Cincinnati, and Marc and Paul, of Hollywood.
