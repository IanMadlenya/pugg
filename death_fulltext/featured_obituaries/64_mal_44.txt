        Mr. Webster, who had hemophilia, died of kidney failure and multiple bacterial infections brought on by AIDS, said a family spokesman, David Mandell, who added that Mr. Webster contracted AIDS from a blood transfusion.
        Mr. Webster was vice chairman of Berenter Greenhouse & Webster, an advertising agency he joined in 1984 as president. He was named vice chairman last year. He had been a senior vice president at Benton & Bowles Inc., where he managed accounts for Upjohn and General Foods.
