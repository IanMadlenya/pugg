        Bernard R. Wieder, a retired owner of resort hotels in New York, New Jersey and Florida, died on Thursday at the Miami Heart Institute. He was 86 years old and lived in Miami Beach.
        He died of congestive heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Wieder started his hotel career in the 1920's as a waiter in the Mohawk Valley in upstate New York. He soon became a maitre d'hotel and in 1937 invested in his first property, the Fairmont Hotel in Mount Freedom, N.J.
        A year later he took over the Reiter House in Lake Mahapac, N.Y., which was owned by his wife's family, and from 1943 to 1946 he operated the Adelon Hotel in Long Beach, L.I. From 1952 to 1971 he owned the Adler in Sharon Springs, N.Y.
        Meanwhile, Mr. Wieder had become interested in Florida properties, and in the 1950's was a partner in construction of the Shore Club in Miami Beach and operated the Surfside Plaza there. He bought the Martinique in Miami Beach in 1965 and ran it until 1975, when he retired and the hotel was turned into the Mar del Plata condominium.
        Shortly after the end of World War II, Mr. Wieder, who was born in the village of Marmaros-Szighet in Hungary, returned to Europe to conduct a long search for his two sisters, who had vanished during the war. He found them in a camp for displaced people, along with more than 20 other former concentration-camp inmates from Marmaros-Szighet, and arranged for all of them to be resettled in the United States.
        Mr. Wieder is survived by his wife, the former Hilda Reiter; a son, David, and a daughter, Celeste, both of Miami Beach; two sisters, Margaret Scharf and Sari Weiser, both of Brooklyn, and two grandchildren.
