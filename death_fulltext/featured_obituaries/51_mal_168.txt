        Robert Kovich, a choreographer and teacher who performed with the Merce Cunningham Dance Company in the 1970's and early 1980's, died on Sunday night at a friend's Manhattan home. He was 40.
        Mr. Kovich died of cancer, said Carol Blanco, the manager of the Robert Kovich Company.
        Mr. Kovich danced with the Cunningham company for eight years, leaving in 1981 to work on his own choreography for several years in France, where he performed at the Pompidou Center in Paris, the Maison de la Danse in Lyon and the Festival at Arles. A stern-seeming virtuoso dancer, he had an ironic wit, great physical deftness and precision and a sense of vivid coloration, qualities that also characterized his dances.
        "Here is dissociation made whole, the equivalent of jigsaw puzzle pieces put back together to create an unexpected and highly original picture," Anna Kisselgoff, chief dance critic of The New York Times, wrote of a recent performance of Mr. Kovich's work.
        Mr. Kovich was also known for his teaching in Europe and at the Cunningham studio, establishing a reputation as a demanding but gentle master teacher.
        Mr. Kovich is survived by his parents, John and Loretta Kovich of Hollister, Calif., and a sister, Janette Ormund, of Portland, Ore. Funeral services will be held at 6 P.M. on Friday at St. Paul's Church, 315 West 22d Street.
