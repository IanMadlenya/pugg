        Mulk Raj Anand, a renowned figure among Indian writers in English whose works depicted the lives of people in India's traditional society, an art critic and an educator, died at Jehandir hospital in Pune on Tuesday.
        He was 99.
        The death was announced by Ram Gohar, his nurse.
        Mr. Anand, whose novels ''Untouchable'' in 1935 and ''Coolie'' in 1936 won him accolades, was influenced by the world of Mohandas K. Gandhi. A staunch Marxist, Mr. Anand never failed in drawing a realistic picture of the poor in India.
        Born in 1905 in Peshawar in what is now Pakistan, he was the son of a coppersmith and soldier. He graduated from the university in Amritsar in 1924 and did additional studies at Cambridge and London University, receiving a Ph.D. in 1929.
        Mr. Anand divided his time between literary London and Gandhi's India in the 1930's and 40's, joining the struggle for Indian independence. He also fought with the republicans in the Spanish Civil War.
        During World War II, he worked as a broadcaster and script writer in the film division of the BBC in London.
        He is survived by his wife and a daughter.
