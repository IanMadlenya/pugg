        Capt. Rita Lenihan of the Navy, who was the director of the Waves and became chairwoman of the regents at Georgetown University after retirement from the service, died of cancer Thursday at Bethesda (Md.) Naval Hospital. She was 75 years old and lived in Washington.
        Captain Lenihan served for four years as the head of the Waves, the now-defunct women's branch of the Navy. In 1972, two years after leaving the post, she joined the regents at Georgetown, where she was chairwoman from 1975 to 1978.
        Captain Lenihan held master's degrees from Georgetown and George Washington University. She was commissioned a Navy ensign in 1943 and was assigned to the Bureau of Naval Personnel. She later served as Director of Officer Personnel and as officer in charge of the Waves Officer School in Newport, R.I.
        In 1966, she was appointed Assistant Chief of Naval Personnel and director of the Waves, whose name was an acronym that stood for Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service. The branch was later succeeded by WIN, or Women in the Navy.
        Captain Lenihan is survived by a sister, Priscilla Lawler of Woodbridge, Conn., and a brother, Edward Lenihan of Verona, N.J.
