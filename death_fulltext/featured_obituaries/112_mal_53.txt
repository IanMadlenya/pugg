        Dr. Samuel Preston Martin 3d, who started a master's degree program for doctors at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, died on May 2 at his daughter's home in Gainesville, Fla. He was 80 and had lived in Philadelphia until three months ago.
        The cause was lymphoma, his family said.
        Dr. Martin, emeritus professor of medicine and health-care systems at the University of Pennsylvania, joined its faculty in 1970 and served in several positions for 25 years, including professor of medicine and director of the Robert W. Johnson Clinical Scholars Program. The M.B.A. curriculum on health-care management at the Wharton School, which he started and taught for about 20 years, has graduated more than 100 doctors since 1970.
        He was born in East Prairie, Mo., the son of a doctor, and received his medical education at Washington University in St. Louis. Before he moved to Philadelphia he was associated with the Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C., and the School of Medicine at the University of Florida in Gainesville.
        In addition to his daughter, Dr. Celia Martin, he is survived by two sons, Dr. Samuel P. Martin 4th of Orlando, Fla., and Dr. William B. Martin of Gainesville, and five grandchildren. His wife, Dorothy Everett Martin, died in February. His previous marriage, to Dr. Ruth Campbell Martin, who also survives, ended in divorce.
