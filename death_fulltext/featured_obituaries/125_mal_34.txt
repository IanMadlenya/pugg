        Dr. Robert Nathanson, a clinical neurologist and founding chairman of the neurology department at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y., died at the medical center on June 1. He was 79 and lived in Roslyn Heights, N.Y.
        He suffered a brief illness, his family said.
        Dr. Nathanson carried out research on brain stem disorders and altered states of consciousness. He contributed more than 70 papers in those areas and on earlier work on multiple sclerosis.
        He was born in lower Manhattan and graduated from the University of Michigan. He received his medical degree from Louisiana State University in 1943 and became associated with New York medical schools and hospitals soon thereafter.
        Dr. Nathanson founded the neurology department at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in 1972 and led it until 1984, when he became chairman emeritus.
        He also taught for many years as a professor of neurology at the medical school of the State University of New York at Stony Brook and, in New York City, at Mount Sinai Hospital and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.
        He is survived by his wife of 49 years, Margret; a son, David, of Tallahassee, Fla.; two daughters, Madlyn Flavell of Guilford, Conn., and Laura Nathanson of Manhattan; a sister, Roslyn Klarish, also of Manhattan, and five grandchildren.
        Correction:  June 10, 1997, Tuesday
        An obituary yesterday about the founding chairman of the neurology department at Long Island Jewish Medical Center misstated his given name. He was Morton Nathanson, not Robert.
