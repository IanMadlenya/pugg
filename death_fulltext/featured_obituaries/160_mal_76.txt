        Dr. Richard Friederich Arens, a mathematician steeped in abstruse theories and abstractions, died on May 3 at a Los Angeles hospital. He was 81 and a resident of Los Angeles.
        The cause was a stroke, said the University of California at Los Angeles, where Dr. Arens worked for 42 years.
        Dr. Arens's reputation rested on his ability to simplify even the most complicated mathematical problems. This made him a leading light in the rarefied strata of functional analysis, function algebras, field theory and quantization.
        He helped found the theories of functional analysis, which observes infinite dimensional spaces, and Banach algebras, named after the Polish mathematician Stefan Banach, which concern the multiplication of continuous sets of numbers..
        In the 1940's and 1950's, he contributed to a theorem allowing mathematicians to classify the infinite dimensional spaces that arise in the study of high energy particles. Another theorem he helped to establish shows that analytic functions of several variables can be applied in the general setting of Banach algebras.
        In the 1960's, Dr. Arens shifted his focus to the mathematical foundations of physics.
        A native of Iserlohn, Germany, he came to the United States at age 6. He graduated from U.C.L.A. in 1941 and received a Ph.D. in mathematics at Harvard in 1945. He returned to U.C.L.A. in 1947 after two years at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J. He retired as an emeritus professor in 1989 but continued to research and write. His final paper, on quantum information theory, was published last year.
        Dr. Arens is survived by a son, Philip, of Los Angeles; a sister, Hildegard Wustenberg of Munich; and two half-brothers, Hubert Arens of Hamburg, Germany, and Ludwig Arens of Denia, Spain. His wife, Helen Cornfeld Arens, a violinist and mathematics professor, died in August.
