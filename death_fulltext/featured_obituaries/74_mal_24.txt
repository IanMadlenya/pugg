        Mogens Erik Christiansen, a chemical engineer who made "Duracell" an international household word in the 1970's, died on Tuesday at Jupiter (Fla.) Hospital. A longtime resident of Old Greenwich, Conn., he kept a winter home in Jupiter. He was 76.
        He suffered a stroke, his family reported.
        Mr. Christiansen retired in 1979 as head of the battery group of the old P. R. Mallory & Company. During his tenure, Mallory's battery division changed from doing business mostly with the Government to enter the consumer market. He introduced the "Duracell" trademark name and the distinctive design of its alkaline batteries, sold here and worldwide. The battery group of Mallory has since become Duracell Inc. of Bethel, Conn.
        A native of Copenhagen, Mr. Christiansen earned a master's in chemical engineering at the University of Copenhagen before moving to New York in 1941 for advanced studies at Columbia University. He made his career in the battery business, starting with General Dry Battery in Cleveland, which later merged into Mallory. He became head of its battery group in 1959.
        Mr. Christiansen is survived by his wife, Mary Schmid Christiansen; two daughters, Elizabeth C. Gentil of Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Ellen A. Christiansen of New York City; a son, Eric A. of Greenwich, Conn.; his mother, Ella Christiansen of Hellerup, Denmark; two brothers, Erik, of Silkeborg, Denmark, and Frederick of Hellerup, and two grandchildren.
