        A native of Calgary, Alberta, he studied at Stanford University and received  a music degree from the Accademia di Santa Cecilia in Rome. In the 1930's, he studied conducting with Toscanini, composition with Arnold Schoenberg and composition and conducting with Strauss. He had taught at the University of San  Francisco since 1975.
