        Albert L. Hotchkin Jr., a wine merchant specializing in Burgundy whose Manhattan shop, restaurants and classes became meeting places for wine enthusiasts of all levels of expertise, died Tuesday at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan. He was 59.
        The cause of death has not yet been determined, said Geraldine Tashjian, his business partner in his shop, the Burgundy Wine Company.
        The shop, which was established in 1988 in the West Village and moved to Chelsea last October, has become renowned nationwide as a supplier of red and white Burgundy and of pinot noirs from the West Coast, as well as Rh√¥ne wines.
        Mr. Hotchkin, a former executive of the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, entered the New York wine scene as a restaurateur and educator in the early 1980's. He owned Tastings, a popular wine bar in Midtown Manhattan, and Tastings on 2, on the East Side. Both served wine by the glass when it first became fashionable and drew a clientele who included celebrated winemakers.
        In 1982, Mr. Hotchkin founded the International Wine Center, a wine school, upstairs at Tastings. The school offered classes and wine club tastings for consumers, both novices and collectors, as well as for sommeliers and others in the wine trade.
        The International Wine Center became a site for trade tastings offered not only by individual producers, domestic and foreign, but also by importers and distributors. It was the site of some of the first commercial tastings held in New York City by the Long Island wine industry, then in its infancy, and by the Australian and Oregonian wine industries.
        Mr. Hotchkin eventually closed both wine bars to establish the Burgundy Wine Company. He retained a financial interest in the center until 1997, when he sold his share to Mary Ewing-Mulligan, its director since 1984.
        Mr. Hotchkin is survived by his wife, Deg Rasmussen of Manhattan, and a brother, Douglas, of Kennebunk, Me.
