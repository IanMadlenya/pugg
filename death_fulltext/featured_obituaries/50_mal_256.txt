        Fritz Kaufmann, a retired professor of economics, died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 94 years old.
        He came to the United States from his native Vienna in 1942. After serving as managing editor at the World Encyclopedia Institute in Manhattan, he was a visiting professor of economics at the University of Vermont from 1947 to 1952.
        In 1949, Professor Kaufmann joined a group of academics for a three-month tour of Europe to evaluate the political and economic effects of the Marshall Plan. He later founded and became director of the Association for Academic Travel Abroad, a nonprofit organization. He also continued to teach at various universities, including the New School for Social Research in Manhattan, and to lecture and write. He retired in 1972.
        Professor Kaufmann was a graduate of the University of Vienna, where he received a law degree. Before coming to the United States he was editor in chief of Die Stunde, a daily newspaper in Vienna. From 1927 to 1933 he was an editor of Der Monthe Morgen, a daily newspaper in Berlin.
        He is survived by a daughter, Elizabeth Koenig of Alexandria, Va., two grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
