        He joined the Bowdoin faculty in 1964, became chairman of the history department in 1967 and was acting dean in 1968.
        He is survived by a daughter, Tracy, of Portland; a son, Christopher, of Berkeley, Calif., and three sisters, Louise Rohver of Brunswick, Katharine Habig of Chebeague Island, Me., and Anne Tucker of Bermuda.
