        Robert F. Kennon, who was Governor of Louisiana from 1952 to 1956, died Monday. He was 85 years old.
        Mr. Kennon, a native of Minden, La., had practiced law in Baton Rouge since he left the Governor's office.
        Mr. Kennon, known as ''Judge'' because of his term on the Louisiana Court of Appeals for the state's 12th Circuit, brought about several major changes in his sole term.
        The Legislature ordered voting machines for every precinct in the state, a constitutional amendment was passed requiring a two-thirds vote of the Legislature to raise taxes, and another amendment placed Civil Service in the Constitution so that it could not be repealed by a simple majority of the Legislature.
        Mr. Kennon won the governorship after Earl K. Long, the brother of the Louisiana political leader Huey P. Long, was unable to succeed himself as Governor under state law and Mr. Kennon entered the race as the head of the anti-Long forces. There were nine candidates and Mr. Kennon handily defeated Mr. Long's candidate, Carlos G. Spaht, in the runoff.
        With Mr. Kennon unable to succeed himself, Mr. Long easily won another term.
        In 1952 Mr. Kennon deserted the Democratic Presidential choice, Adlai E. Stevenson, and supported Dwight D. Eisenhower.
        Survivors include his wife, Eugenia Sentell Kennon; three sons, Robert Jr., Charles and Ken; a brother, George Webb Kennon, and five grandchildren.
