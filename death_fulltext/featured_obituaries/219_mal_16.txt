        Bradford N. Swett, a real estate developer active in the vigorous development of the Upper West Side of Manhattan in the 1980's and 90's, died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 69.
        The cause was glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Swett bought and refurbished residential and commercial buildings on the East and West Sides of Manhattan, as well as in some of the city's less gentrified areas, including Harlem, the South Bronx and Greenpoint, Brooklyn.
        His attempt to develop the site of Symphony Space and the Thalia movie house at Broadway and 95th Street in the mid-1980's led to a protracted legal battle that was not resolved until a decade later. In 1996, the New York State Court of Appeals ruled that Mr. Swett and his partner, Pergola Properties, could not exercise their option to buy the building. Pergola had planned to replace the building with a multiplex theater.
        Bradford Norris Swett was born in Hartford, Conn., on June 10, 1935, and earned a bachelor's degree from Harvard in 1957. A varsity skier at Harvard, Mr. Swett was a former president of the Mad River Glen ski resort in Vermont. In the 1960's, he and a partner developed homes on the slopes there and at the Sugarbush resort in Warren, Vt.
        Mr. Swett's first marriage, to Eleanor Chance Burgess, ended in divorce. He is survived by his second wife, Holly McAllister Swett; his mother, Mrs. Olcott D. Smith, of Farmington, Conn.; two brothers: Steven, of Norwich, Conn., and Thomas, of Unionville, Pa.; three children from his first marriage: Bradford Chance Swett of Geneseo, N.Y., Jennifer Chrisman of San Francisco and Hannah Swett of New York; and one grandchild.
