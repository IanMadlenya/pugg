        Leo Grebler, professor emeritus of urban land economics at the University of California at Los Angeles, died Tuesday at U.C.L.A. Medical Center. He was 90 years old and lived in West Los Angeles.
        Professor Grebler died of a heart attack, a spokesman for the family said.
        He and his wife emigrated to the United States from Germany in 1937. From 1939 to 1944 he was an analyst with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and from 1944 to 1946 chief of the housing finance section of the Federal Housing Administration in Washington.
        He was also a consultant to the United Nations, various Presidential commissions and the governors of the Federal Reserve System.
        From 1948 to 1958 he was associate director and research professor of Columbia University's Institute for Urban Land Use and Housing Studies. He joined the U.C.L.A. faculty in 1958 and retired in 1966.
        He was the author of 18 books, including "Capital Formation in Residential Real Estate" (Princeton University Press, 1956), and "The Mexican-American People" (The Free Press, 1970), a study of the nature and problems of that community.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Annemarie Gerson; a daughter, Jean Quataert, a history professor at the State University of New York in Binghamton, and a grandson.
