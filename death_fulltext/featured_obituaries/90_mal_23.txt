        In 1951, Mr. Schachner became special counsel to a House subcommittee on the administration of Internal Revenue Service laws. He also briefly represented the United Nations Legal Department.
        Mr. Schachner entered private practice in 1952, focusing on estate, taxation and criminal cases for an international clientele. He also was an associate editor of the Federal Bar Journal and contributed articles to other professional periodicals.
