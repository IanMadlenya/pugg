        Dr. Brooks Ryder, a public health doctor and an international consultant on family planning, died on Sunday at his home in Winchester, N.H. He was 76.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Born in North Attleboro, Mass., Dr. Ryder graduated from Harvard College and Tufts College Medical School. He served as a district health officer in Massachusetts while earning a master's degree at the Harvard School of Public Health.
        He began his overseas career in 1956 directing the Haile Selassie Public Health College and Training Center in Ethiopia. Concerned with the link between population growth and public health, he subsequently took assignments to establish family planning programs in Africa, Asia and Latin America under the auspices of the Ford Foundation as well as United States Government and United Nations agencies.
        He retired to his farm in Winchester 10 years ago.
        Dr. Ryder is survived by his wife of 38 years, Cynthia Palmer Ryder; four daughters, Ann Ryder of Branford, Conn., Priscilla Ryder of Arlington, Mass., Penelope Vaine of Winchester, and Phyllis Mentzell Ryder of Tucson, Ariz.; a brother, Austin, of Chatham, Mass.; a sister, Marie Riley of North Attleboro; and four grandchildren.
