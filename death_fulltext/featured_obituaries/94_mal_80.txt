        Stephen Dykes Bower, a British church architect skilled in the Gothic style, died on Friday in Quendon, 20 miles north of London. He was 91 and lived in Quendon.
        Mr. Dykes Bower was known particularly for his work on Westminster Abbey. From 1951 to 1973, he held the title of Surveyor of the Fabric of the abbey. The newspaper The Independent said on Monday: "Dykes Bower found the Abbey hidden beneath the dust of centuries. He left it as a unified work of art, its disparate elements brought into harmony."
        At the abbey, his design skills were brought to bear on everything from the restoring of the shrine of St. Edward the Confessor to the choice of coloring for choir stalls and even the selection of fabrics for clerics' vestments. He also oversaw many repairs and much maintenance and cleaning.
        In addition, Mr. Dykes Bower did architectural work for colleges at Oxford and Cambridge Universities as well as numerous cathedrals and churches.
        He was born in Gloucester, studied at Oxford and at the Architectural Association School in London and, in 1993, received an honorary doctorate in letters from the Archbishop of Canturbury.
