        Richard A. Parker, professor emeritus of egyptology at Brown University and an author and researcher on the subject, died on Thursday in Providence, R.I. He was 87.
        He had remained active in his work and died peacefully at his home, the university said.
        Professor Parker came to Brown in 1949 after teaching at the University of Chicago, for which he did extensive field work in Egypt. At Brown he was appointed Wilbour Professor of Egyptology as well as chairman of its new Department of Egyptology.
        In 1951 he went to Egypt to examine monuments linked to ancient astronomy, and a few years later he studied papyri at Paris, Florence, Vienna, Copenhagen and Oxford, in Britain.
        He took a special interest in the history of ancient science and mathematics and wrote or collaborated on a dozen books. He retired in 1972.
        He was born in Chicago. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1930 and became a research assistant at the University of Chicago, receiving his Ph.D. there in 1938.
        While teaching in Chicago, he joined a permanent expedition based in Luxor, Egypt, and became its field director, studying the mortuary temple of Ramses III. He was reluctant to leave that post but relented at the prospect of his own department at Brown.
        Among his books were "The Calendars of Ancient Egypt" (University of Chicago Press, 1950) and, with Waldo H. Duberstein, "Babylonian Chronology 626 B.C.-A.D.75" (Brown University Press, 1956). He was a member of many societies in his field, both in this country and overseas.
        Professor Parker is survived by his wife, the former Gladys Burns; a daughter, Beatrice A., of Providence, and one grandson.
