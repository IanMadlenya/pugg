        Marcantonio Vilaca, an art dealer whose gallery in Sao Paolo was as instrumental in introducing European and North American artists to South America as it was in promoting young South American artists abroad, died on Jan. 1 at his parents' home in Recife, Brazil. He was 38.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Karla Meneghel Ferraz de Camargo, Mr. Vilaca's partner.
        Mr. Vilaca was born in Recife in 1962 and began collecting at the age of 15. He graduated from Mackenzie University in Sao Paulo in 1985, majoring in law. Mr. Vilaca began his art career in the late 1980's, working first as director of Galeria Algodoeira Palmceirense and then as co-owner of Galeria Passargada de Arte Contemporanca, both in Sao Paulo. In 1992 he opened Galerie Camargo Vilaca with Ms. Camargo. The gallery promoted, often with first shows, such internationally known Brazilian artists as Beatriz Milhazes, Ernesto Neto, Valeska Soares, Jac Leiner and Adriana Varejao. Artists from the United States and Europe who had their first South American exhibitions at Camargo Vilaca included Charles Long, Fabian Marcaccio, Juan Usle, Pedro Cabrita Reis and Saint Clair Cemin.
        In addition to his parents, Maria and Marcos Vilaca, he is survived by a sister, Taciana Vilaca Bezerra of Recife, and a brother, Rodrigo, of Sao Paulo.
