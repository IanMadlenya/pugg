        Mr. Ellis, who was born in Fort Worth, received his bachelor's and master's degrees from the Manhattan School of Music and pursued further study in Europe on various fellowships.
        As a pianist, he played both in midtown concert halls and in more unusual, theatrical spaces, sometimes employing dramatic lighting and dance as adjuncts to his music making.
