        The Rev. Raymond Roesch, former president of the University of Dayton and of Chaminade University in Hawaii, died at his campus home on Sunday, apparently of a heart attack, the university said. He was 76 years old.
        Father Roesch, who graduated from Dayton in 1936, was president of the university from 1959 to 1979. He was president of Chaminade from 1982 to 1989, when he returned to Dayton to work as a special assistant to the University of Dayton president, Brother Raymond Fitz.
