        Fabrizio De Andre, one of Italy's most popular singers and songwriters, died on Jan. 11 in a hospital in Milan where he was admitted in December. He was 58.
        The cause was cancer, according to Italian news reports.
        Known in Italy as the ''poet of music,'' Mr. De Andre became popular during the mid-1960's when his songs of rebellion and social justice struck a note with Italian youth.
        His popularity rocketed after his songs were adopted as the anthems of the protest movement that swept Italy in 1968.
        Like Leonard Cohen, Mr. De Andre was recognized foremost as a poet who put his own words to music. In Italy he developed the idea of the concept album with songs revolving around one theme.
        Among his most popular works were ''The Good News,'' based upon the Apocrypha, and a 1971 album based on ''Spoon River Anthology'' by Edgar Lee Masters.
        He was one of the first Italian performers to integrate his songs with musical influences from different ethnic backgrounds, including  those of native Americans.
        Fabrizio De Andre was born in Genoa in 1940. His first musical hit came in 1965 when Mina, a popular Italian singer, recorded a best-selling version of his ''Canzone di Marinella.'' Best-selling albums followed, weaving Mr. De Andre's compelling lyrics and his multifaceted musical vision into songs that gave voice to the angst of his generation.
        Eclectic in his choice of subjects, from big-hearted prostitutes to disaffected civil servants, his music reflected a wide range of influences.
        Mr. De Andre lived for many years in Sardinia, even after he was kidnapped by political extremists and held hostage with his wife, Dori Ghezzi, for more than three months in 1979.
        He is survived by his wife, a son, Cristiano, and a daughter, Luvi.
