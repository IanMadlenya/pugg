        Dr. Nicholas E. Davies, an internist who was to assume office as president of the American College of Physicians later this week, was killed Friday in the commuter airline crash that also took the life of former Senator John G. Tower. Dr. Davies was 65 years old and lived in Atlanta.
        Dr. Davies had taken the commuter flight to address the college's governors on Jekyll Island off the Georgia coast, said an associate, Dr. Spencer Welch.
        As president-elect, Dr. Davies's first priority was to improve access to health care, the college said yesterday. He was the first chair of the college's Access/Health System Reform steering committee and testified before Congress on the problems of adequate health care.
        He was a clinical professor of medicine at the Emory University School of Medicine and an attending physician at Piedmont and Grady Memorial Hospitals in Atlanta.
        Born in Philadelphia, Dr. Davies grew up in Clifton Forge, Va. He received his bachelor's and medical degrees from the University of Virginia and was an intern at Cincinnati General Hospital until 1953, when he joined the United States Air Force as a flight surgeon.
        He returned to civilian life in 1955 as a resident at Grady Memorial Hospital. In 1978, he was appointed by President Jimmy Carter to the Board of Regents of the National Library of Medicine and served as chairman in 1980-81.
        Author of more than 50 scientific articles, he was a member of the American Medical Association and the medical and heart associations of Atlanta and Georgia. He headed the American College of Physicians publication policy committee from 1988 to 1990.
        He is survived by his wife, Garland; a son, Nicholas Jr. of New York City; two daughters, Elizabeth, of Philadelphia, and Sally, of Mystic, Conn.; his mother, Margaret, and a brother, Thomas, both of Lynchburg, Va., and four grandchildren.
