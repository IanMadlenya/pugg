        George R. Vierno, retired chief of department of the New York City Correction Department, died yesterday at his home in Huguenot, S.I. He was 50 years old.
        He died of a heart attack while shoveling snow, a spokesman for the department said.
        Mr. Vierno began his career as a correction officer in 1962. Ten years later he was promoted to captain and in February of this year he was named acting commissioner. In March, he became chief of department, the hightest uniformed rank in the department. He retired in May.
        In 1989 he received a Fund for the City of New York Public Service Award for introducing a computer system to deal with assignments and for his talent at rearranging cells, beds and prisoners to create space for inmates in a system packed to 110 percent of its intended capacity.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Mary Giardino; a son, George Jr., and a daughter, Stephanie, both of Huguenot.
