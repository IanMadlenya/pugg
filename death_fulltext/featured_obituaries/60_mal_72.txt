        Martin Dibner, a novelist and arts administrator, died on Saturday at his home in Casco, Me. He was 80 years old.
        He died of heart failure, said his son Stephen.
        Mr. Dibner, a native of Brooklyn, attended the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, earning a bachelor's degree in banking and finance. He briefly worked as a commercial artist in New York City and Miami before serving in the Navy during World War II. After the war, he did graduate work in painting and sculpture at Rollins College in Winter Park, Fla.
        For his best-known novel, "The Deep Six" (1953), set on a ship patrolling the Aleutian Islands during World War II, Mr. Dibner drew on his wartime experience. His eight other novels included "Showcase" (1958) and "Ransom Run" (1977). He also wrote the text for "Seacoast Maine" (1973), a book of photographs by George Tice, and "Portrait of Paris Hill" (1990), about a village in Maine.
        Mr. Dibner was the first director of the Joan Whitney Payson Gallery at Westbrook College in Portland, Me., from 1975 to 1978, and the first director of the California Arts Commission.
        In addition to his son Stephen, of St. Louis, he is survived by another son, Eric, of Santa Fe, N.M. and Casco, and a grandson.
