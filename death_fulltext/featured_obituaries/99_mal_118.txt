        Dr. Walter L. Eisenberg, an economics professor emeritus at Hunter College who helped settle many labor disputes at the city, state and Federal levels, died on Saturday at his home in Brooklyn. He was 74.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Beatrice Kaufman Eisenberg, his wife of 49 years.
        Over more than three decades, Dr. Eisenberg was engaged as a mediator, arbitrator or fact-finder in some 2,000 labor-management confrontations. At his death, he was a member of the New York State Public Employment Relations Board, which he joined 10 years ago.
        He was formerly associated with the city's Board of Collective Bargaining and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Board. He served as chairman and public member of panels and commissions at all levels, dealing with minimum wages, pensions and employment, among other things.
        The disputes at hand affected occupations of great diversity, including doctors, nurses and teachers, production and maintenance personnel, airline pilots and iron workers, to name a few.
        Walter Eisenberg grew up in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn and graduated in economics from City College in 1941. He held master's and Ph.D. degrees in economics from Columbia University.
        He began his career at Hunter College of the City University of New York in 1949 as a lecturer in economics. He was elected department chairman in 1965 and became dean of graduate studies at Hunter in 1972. He retired from the college in 1979, after which he made labor disputes his principal occupation.
        He was a former board chairman of Group Health Insurance Inc. He retired from G.H.I. last year after more than 20 years on the board, but at his death was a member of the G.H.I. Home Care Board of Governors.
        In addition to his wife, Dr. Eisenberg is survived by a daughter, Debbie Eisenberg Levene of Kitchener, Ont., a son, David, of Leawood, Kan., and four grandchildren.
