        Philip Lukin, an advertising executive in New York for four decades, died in his sleep on Sunday at his home in Palm Beach, Fla. He was 87 years old.
        Mr. Lukin, who was born in Manhattan and graduated from Brown University, specialized in liquor advertising for most of his career. In 1933, after seven years as executive vice president of Charles Austin Bates, he joined Lawrence Fertig & Company, eventually becoming the president.
        After the repeal of Prohibition, he helped introduce several liquor brands, including I. W. Harper bourbon, Fleischmann's gin and de Kuyper cordials.
        In 1962, the Fertig agency was merged into Lennen & Newell, of which Mr. Lukin became senior vice president.
        After he retired to Palm Beach in 1970, he formed a business consulting firm and invested in research and development companies. At his death, he was editor and co-publisher of The Palm Beach Social Observer.
        He is survived by his third wife, the former Vera Racolin Cameo, whom he married in 1957.
