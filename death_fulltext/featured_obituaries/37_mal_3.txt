        Group Capt. F. W. Winterbotham, who played a key role in exploiting broken German codes in World War II and wrote the best-selling memoir ''The Ultra Secret,'' died on Sunday, British news reports said today. He was 92 years old.
        Frederick William Winterbotham was a pilot in World War I, and in 1929 was made head of aerial intelligence in the British intelligence agency M.I.6.
        In the 1930's he managed to befriend senior Nazi figures in Germany and glean information about the Luftwaffe. In 1939 he helped devise a vital new method of aerial reconnaissance photography.
        But his most important work was with Enigma, the top-secret German code system that the British had managed to penetrate.
        Captain Winterbotham's job was to get the information from Enigma, or ''Ultra intelligence'' as it was known, to commanders in the field without revealing to the Germans that their code had been cracked. He worked out a system that was successful throughout the war, and did not become public knowledge until the 1970's.
        Captain Winterbotham was married twice and had four children.
