        Moses H. Hoenig, a lawyer and founding member and honorary president of the National Council of Young Israel, died yesterday at his home in Long Beach, L.I. He was 92 years old.
        Mr. Hoenig died of cancer, a spokesman for the family said.
        Mr. Hoenig helped start the Young Israel movement in 1924 in an effort to meld the tenets of Orthodox jewry with American culture. Today, 300 synagogues in the United States, Canada and Israel belong to the organization.
        Mr. Hoenig was senior president of the executive board at his death. He was also president of the Brooklyn Jewish Community Council. He was a lawyer in private practice for 70 years.
        He was born in Manhattan and graduated from City College and Brooklyn Law School.
        He is survived by a daughter, Pearl Jetter of Oceanside, L.I.; two sons, D. Bernard, of Far Rockaway, Queens, and Rabbi Samuel N., of Monsey, N.Y.; two sisters, Ceilia Drazen of Jerusalem, and Hanah Cohen of Far Rockaway; 10 grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.
