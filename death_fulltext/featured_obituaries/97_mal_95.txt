        Dr. Aubrey E. Boyd 3d, a physician and professor who was a leading researcher into how drugs work on diabetes that develops in adulthood, died on Feb. 7 in his home in Hingham, Mass. He was 54.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Nancy Stice Boyd.
        Research conducted by Dr. Boyd over the last 15 years produced evidence about how sugar in the blood causes insulin to be secreted by the pancreas. He was working on the development of oral drugs that could be used as alternatives to insulin in the treatment of the forms of diabetes that develop in adulthood.
        He was chief of endocrinology, metabolism, diabetes and molecular medicine at New England Medical Center and a professor of physiology, neuroscience and medicine at the Tufts University School of Medicine.
        Born in Paducah, Ky., he graduated from Vanderbilt University in 1962 and received a medical degree from Washington University in St. Louis in 1966. He served as a major in the Army Medical Corps from 1970 to 1973 before serving as director of the Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.
        He joined the staff of New England Medical Center in 1990 and directed a special clinical study unit that was supported by the National Institutes of Health.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Hugh Aubrey Boyd; his mother, Billie G. Boyd of Paducah, and a brother, David, of Washington.
