        Donald Sur, a composer and musicologist, died on Monday at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. He was 64.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Sur's best-known work was ''The Slavery Documents,'' an oratorio commissioned by the Canata Singers of Cambridge, Mass. The work, which was given its premiere at Symphony Hall in Boston in 1990, incorporated spirituals and folk songs as well as excerpts from the Bible and other writings.
        Mr. Sur was born in Honolulu and moved to Los Angeles after World War II. He later earned graduate degrees at Princeton and Harvard and studied composition with Rogers Sessions and Earl Kim. After moving to the Boston area about 30 years ago, he taught at Harvard, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Tufts, Wellesley and Boston University.
        His compositions also include ''New Yorker Sketches,'' ''Catena III,'' ''Kumdori Tansaeng,'' a work for violin, chorus and orchestra, and Berceuse for Violin and Piano, which had its premiere at the Library of Congress in February.
        He is survived by a son, Matthew, of Boston; two half-brothers, Dr. John Kim of Honolulu and Laurence Kim of New York, and his mother, B. D. Sur of Somerville, Mass.
