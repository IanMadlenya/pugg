        Jerrold Wexler, a leading real estate developer in Chicago who built and owned dozens of office and apartment buildings, died on Saturday at Stanford Hospital in Palo Alto, Calif. He was 68 years old and lived in Chicago.
        He died of lymphoma, his family said.
        With his partner, Edward Ross, Mr. Wexler expanded Jupiter Industries into an international conglomerate worth at least $2.5 billion. Among the structures he owned or invested in were the Playboy building and the Drake Hotel.
        He was known as an expert deal maker and an innovator who saw the potential of neglected sites. For example, after he built the Outer Drive East apartment tower in a desolate Chicago area of railroad tracks, old warehouses and empty lots, the neighborhood flourished.
        His other developments included the Executive Plaza Hotel, the Streeterville area and the Magnificent Mile area. A self-critic, Mr. Wexler said in 1990 that his projects had too often lacked architectural distinction.
        In New York, his company developed the Vista International hotel at the World Trade Center.
        Mr. Wexler was born in Chicago and was a graduate of Northwestern University. His first marriage ended in divorce.
        He is survived by his wife of more than 20 years, the former Susan Metzger; his mother, Lottie, of Los Angeles; five daughters, Tanya Wexler of New York City, Diane Grant and Susan Piser, both of Chicago, and Judith Gigliotti and Jane Feil, both of Santa Monica, Calif.; a stepson, Donald Hannah of California; two stepdaughters, Darryl Hannah, the actress, of New York and Los Angeles, and Page Adler of Malibu, Calif.; two brothers, Yale of Chicago and Haskel, the noted cinematographer, of Santa Monica; a sister, Joyce Isaacs of Chicago, and 20 grandchildren.
