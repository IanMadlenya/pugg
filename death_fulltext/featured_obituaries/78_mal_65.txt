        Jack Bittner, an actor and singer in theater, television and the opera for half a century, died on June 26 at his home in Manhattan. He was 76.
        His wife, Mae Cooper Bittner, said the cause was a heart attack.
        Mr. Bittner was known best as a Shakespearean actor. He appeared in more than 40 productions and was runner-up for a Clarence Derwent Award in 1954 for best supporting performances in "Richard III" and "Coriolanus."
        Brooks Atkinson, who reviewed the Antioch Shakespeare Festival production of "Coriolanus" in Yellow Springs, Ohio, in 1953, praised Mr. Bittner's portrayal of Aufidius as "forceful and illuminating."
        In 1958, Mr. Bittner won critical approval for his performances in "Hamlet," "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and "The Winter's Tale" at the American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Conn.
        He made his Broadway debut in 1942, as a monk in "Nathan the Wise" at the Belasco Theater. His other Broadway roles included Mr. Frey in "All the King's Men," in 1948; Senator Blake in a revival of "Room Service" in 1953; the foreman of the jury in "Witness for the Prosecution," in 1954, and Topman, the lusty young sailor in "Tiger at the Gates," in 1955.
        Mr. Bittner, a baritone, made his singing debut in the New York City Opera's production of Shostakovich's "Katerina Ismailova" in 1965. His other roles with the company included Assan in "The Consul" in 1966 and the Sacristan in "Tosca" in 1968.
        He also made some 300 appearances on television programs, among them the "Hallmark Hall of Fame" on NBC and "The Defenders" on CBS. He also played the leading role in a surrealist film, "Dreams that Money Can Buy," in 1948.
        Mr. Bittner was born in Omaha. He graduated from the University of Nebraska in 1940 and continued his studies at the Dramatic Workshop of the New School in New York.
        He is survived by his wife.
