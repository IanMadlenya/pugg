        Osie Hawkins, a baritone who sang at the Metropolitan Opera for 25 seasons, died on Tuesday at Phenix Medical Park Hospital in Phenix City, Ala. He was 79.
        A statement from the Metropolitan said he died of natural causes.
        In the course of his operatic career, Mr. Hawkins appeared in 53 roles in 39 works, for a total of 960 performances. He made his debut at the Met in 1942 as Donner in Wagner's "Rheingold" and in later years appeared frequently in Puccini's "Madama Butterfly," Wagner's "Meistersinger von Nurnberg" and Verdi's "Traviata."
        Although most of his performances were in secondary roles, he also portrayed some major Wagnerian characters, including Wotan in "Die Walkure" and Amfortas in "Parsifal." He also sang in the Met premieres of Mussorgsky's "Khovanschina" in 1950 and Verdi's "Macbeth" in 1959.
        His last singing roles in the house were during the 1964-65 season, although he returned to the Met stage in the 1984-85 and 1985-86 seasons in the speaking role of Mr. Archdale in "Porgy and Bess."
        Mr. Hawkins became the Met's executive stage manager in 1963, shortly before ending his singing career, and remained in that post until January 1978. After his retirement, he worked with the Met in artist relations and other areas for many years.
        He is survived by a sister, Alice.
