        Charles P. McHugh, a chemical engineer who devised a method to coat steel with vulcanized rubber to protect it from corrosion, died on Friday of heart failure in Eustice, Fla., where he moved after his retirement in 1971. He was 93 and previously lived in Ridgewood, N.J.
        He was born in Watertown, Mass., and graduated in chemical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1926. Early in the Depression, he got a job with Raybestos Manhattan Rubber Company of Passaic, N.J., where he developed his vulcanization process.
        Its first application sheathed the propeller shaft of a Navy cruiser in the mid-1930's. Then and during World War II, he helped the Navy refit most of its vessels with rubber-coated propeller shafts as well as battery compartments for its submarines.
        Later, Mr. McHugh became director of research and development at Raybestos. Among his accomplishments was a way to replace chain drives with rubber belts on paper-manufacturing machinery, which reduced noise levels in paper mills.
        Mr. McHugh is survived by two sons, Dr. Charles T. McHugh of Woodland, Me., and John F. McHugh of Ho-Ho-Kus, N.J.; three sisters, Dorothy M. Hass, Katherine Joyce, and Alice Donohoe, all of Eustis, and five grandchildren. His wife, Mary, died in 1986.
