        Richard Wesley Lawrence Jr., the founding chairman of the Adirondack Park Agency, died on Feb. 6 in Elizabethtown, N.Y., the Essex County village where he lived. He was 93.
        A retired New York lawyer and foundation executive and an Adirondacks resident since 1947, Mr. Lawrence was long active in the causes of conservation, the environment and education. His interests led Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller to choose him in the planning of the Adirondack Park Agency and name him chairman when it was created in 1971.
        Mr. Lawrence saw the agency through its infancy, a crucial period for shaping state policy for more than 9,000 square miles of publicly and privately held land, a preserve roughly the size of Vermont and the nation's largest parkland. He stayed at the helm through 1975, and after that he remained on the boards of various related associations.
        Mr. Lawrence graduated from Princeton University in 1931 and from Columbia University Law School in 1934. He served in the Army Air Corps in World War II and retired in 1969 as a lieutenant colonel of the Air Force Reserve.
        He helped incorporate the Crary Foundation of Elizabethtown, which provides college scholarships for Adirondack students. He was its president from its founding in 1973 until 2000.
        Mr. Lawrence is survived by two daughters, Alida L. Currey of Grand Junction, Colo., and Elizabeth W. Lawrence of Elizabethtown; two granddaughters and three great-grandchildren.
