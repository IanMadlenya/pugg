        Elias Motsoaledi, a South African opponent of apartheid and a former Johannesburg regional commander of the African National Congress's guerrilla wing who was imprisoned with Nelson Mandela, died on May 10 in Soweto, South Africa. He was 69 years old.
        He died of throat cancer, The Associated Press reported.
        Mr. Mandela, now South Africa's President, spoke at Mr. Motsoaledi's funeral on Saturday in Soweto and called him a "worthy freedom fighter, second to none."
        Born in the northern Transvaal, Mr. Motsoaledi became a factory worker and then a trade unionist, joining the congress in 1948.
        In 1964 he, Mr. Mandela and six others were convicted of having planned a "violent revolution" against South Africa's racial policies. He was freed in 1989, not long before Mr. Mandela's release.
        Mr. Motsoaledi is survived by his wife, Caroline, and six children.
