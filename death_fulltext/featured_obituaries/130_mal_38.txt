The plays he produced and directed for the company include Eugene O'Neill's ''Great God Brown,'' William Saroyan's ''Beautiful People'' and Moss Hart's ''Light Up the Sky.'' Mr. James also acted in a number of the theater's productions. He played the title role in Chekhov's ''Uncle Vanya'' and also appeared in O'Neill's ''Mourning Becomes Electra'' and Synge's ''In the Shadow of the Glen.''
        Mr. James, whose original name was William T. Krichbaum 3d, was born in Cleveland and held a bachelor's degree in theater arts from Denison University in Granville, Ohio.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by his parents, Carolyn and Dr. William T. Krichbaum of North Canton, Ohio; a sister, Lyn Evans of Fort Mill, S.C., and a brother, Jim, of Alliance, Ohio.
