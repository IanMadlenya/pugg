        Mr. Rees died of complications resulting from a stroke, his granddaughter Joanna said.
        Mr. Rees began flying at the age of 85, after taking lessons at the Lincoln Park Airport in Hanover, N.J. He received his license the same year and continued to fly until the day before he suffered a stroke.
        He was the principal plumbing contractor for the Westinghouse Corporation for 50 years. He retired at the first of this year.

        A native of Bloomfield, N.J., he was the last surviving member of Troop Number One of the Boy Scouts of America, which was formed in Bloomfield in 1910.
        Mr. Rees joined the Army at the age of 16, after lying about his age.
        His wife of 62 years, the former Dolores Carnevale, died in 1982.
        Besides his granddaughter of Upper Montclair, N.J., he is survived by a daughter, Vivian de Graaff of Short Hills, N.J.; a son, John H., of Montclair, N.J.; 11 grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.
