        Thomas F. Willers, a former top executive of Hooker Chemical and Occidental Petroleum and of Champion International, the paper company, died on March 24 at his home in Riverside, Conn. He was 84.
        The cause was respiratory failure, the Leo P. Gallagher & Son Funeral Home announced.
        Mr. Willers, a native of Niagara Falls, N.Y., spent most of his career at Hooker. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1941 in economics and business administration and joined the company that year, advancing in financial positions until being named president in 1963.
        Hooker Chemical was bought by Occidental in 1968 and Mr. Willers became president of the parent company. He rose to vice chairman in 1970 and was seen as a possible heir to Occidental's founder and chairman, Armand Hammer. But he quit a year later, saying he was disenchanted by how Occidental was run.
        In 1972, U.S. Plywood-Champion Papers brought him in to be president and a possible successor to its chairman, Karl R. Bendetsen.
        The company became Champion International, and Mr. Willers took over as chairman and chief executive. Mr. Willers resigned in 1974, citing policy disagreements with the board. (Champion International was bought by International Paper in 2000.)
        Later in the 70's, Mr. Willers worked with Universe Tankships and National Bulk Carriers in the Amazon basin. Among the projects he was associated with was the construction of a pulp mill built in Japan and towed to Brazil.
        Mr. Willers is survived by his wife of 65 years, Jean Campbell Willers; a daughter, Diana W. Merriam, of Palm Desert, Calif.; three sons, Thomas C., of Carpentersville, Ill., Mark C., of Los Angeles, and Jock R., of Lakeland, Fla.; 11 grandchildren, and 5 great-grandchildren.
