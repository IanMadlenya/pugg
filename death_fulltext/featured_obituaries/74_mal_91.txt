        Lloyd S. Howard, head of a New York advertising agency, died on Sunday at his home in Millwood, N.Y. He was 66.
        A family member said he had a heart attack.
        After graduating from the University of Michigan, he established in 1952 the Madison Avenue advertising agency that bore his name, Lloyd S. Howard Associates.
        He promoted the lamp industry in New York and became executive director of a group working to maintain and strengthen the industry's market in New York City.
        He also promoted the swimming pool industry and campaigned for fair advertising practices.
        Mr. Howard later moved his agency's headquarters to Millwood in Westchester County, where he made a reputation as a farmer, raising cattle on his 22-acre estate, Snake Hill Farm.
        He is survived by his wife, Candace Leeds Howard.
