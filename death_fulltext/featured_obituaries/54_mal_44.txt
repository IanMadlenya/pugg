        Robert U. Molloy, a former judge for the New York City Court of Special Sessions, died on Monday at a nursing home in Highland Ranch, Colo. He was 89 years old and lived in Fort Lauderdale. Fla.
        Judge Molloy died of heart failure, a spokesman for the family said.
        He was appointed a justice to the Court of Special Sessions by Mayor Robert F. Wagner in 1956, a post he held until he retired in 1970.
        Before his appointment to the Court of Special Sessions -- now known as Criminal Court -- he had been a justice of the Municipal Court since 1955. For the preceeding 20 years, he had been an active trial lawyer. He was the lawyer of record and chief trial counsel of the Zurich Insurance Company and a member of the law firm of Shumate, Barrett & Molloy, later Barrett, Molloy Geoghan & Swiggett.
        Judge Molloy had been a member of the board of governors of the Trial Lawyers Association of the City of New York and a member of the Metropolitan Trial Lawyers Association.
        He was a graduate of New York Law School and was admitted to the bar in 1935.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Carolyn Uhrig; a daughter from a former marriage to the late Helen K. Molloy, Mary V. Landmann of Titusville, Fla.; a step-daughter, Carol Maier of Highland Ranch, Colo.; three grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.
