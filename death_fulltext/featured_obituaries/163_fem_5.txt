        Ethel Brown Fitzgerald, a former New York City teacher and school administrator, lawyer and musician, died July 19 at a hospital in upstate Amsterdam. She was 68 and lived in Fonda, N.Y., and Brooklyn.
        The cause was cancer, her family said.
        Mrs. Fitzgerald spent 16 often contentious years on the City Board of Education's semiautonomous Board of Examiners, from 1974 until the State Legislature restructured it out of existence in 1990. She served variously as a member, vice chairwoman and chairwoman.
        The examiners tested prospective teachers and supervisors and drew up lists from which the school board appointed job candidates. Their critics charged the panel had become a cumbersome anachronism and a bottleneck.
        In Mrs. Fitzgerald's view the chancellor and school board were trying to circumvent the merit system. Indeed, she asserted, they flirted with the very Tammany Hall-style patronage system that led to the creation of the independent examiners in the first place, in 1898.
        A native New Yorker, Mrs. Fitzgerald was a 1954 music graduate of Hunter College and taught orchestral and choral music in the public schools until 1967. As Ethel Brown, a member of the musicians' union, she played the cello with professional symphony orchestras.
        By 1968 she had completed her graduate work at Brooklyn College, Columbia University and New York University. She received the certificate of an education supervisor and administrator from Hunter, and, in 1981, she received a doctor of laws degree from Brooklyn Law School.
        She held a number of positions as assistant principal, principal and teachers' trainer before being appointed to the Board of Examiners, then practically a lifetime job. In recent years she had been in private law practice in Fonda.
        Mrs. Fitzgerald is survived by a son, Dr. Kim Fitzgerald of Cleveland; her mother, Effie Hargett Brown of Fonda; and six grandchildren.
