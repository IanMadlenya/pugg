        Mel Finkelstein, The New York Post's photography editor and an award-winning photographer at three other newspapers, died on Friday at South Nassau Community Hospital in Oceanside, L.I. He was 60 years old and lived in Baldwin, L.I.
        He died of bone-marrow cancer, his family said.
        As a 16-year-old high school student, Mr. Finkelstein started working for The Journal-American. He stayed through its merger into The World-Journal-Tribune and that paper's demise in 1967. For the next 20 years he worked at The Daily News, then joined The Post in 1988.
        His many honors included awards from the National Press Photographers Association, Society of Silurians, New York Press Photographers Association, Deadline Club and New York Newspaper Guild.
        His photographs ranged from celebrities like Marilyn Monroe and Harry S. Truman to grim scenes of death. One was a slain mobster under a movie marquee billing Mickey Spillane's "My Gun Is Quick." Another picture showed a murdered woman next to a church entrance with her head facing a bulletin board saying "All Are Welcome."
        Guest passengers in his roving radio car included Walter Winchell and Robert F. Kennedy. Putting his camera down, Mr. Finkelstein helped capture an armed bank robber and coaxed several would-be jumpers to safety.
        Mr. Finkelstein's wife of 37 years, the former Janet Levande, died last year.
        He is survived by four daughters, Anita Rosenbloom of Manhattan, Donna Wendler of Baldwin, Alana Tietje of Tavernier,Fla., and Susan Geier of Tarpon Springs, Fla.; a brother, Perry of Baldwin, and six grandchildren.
