       Bernard S. Rubel, who was executive vice president of Rubel's Inc., a Middletown, Conn., retail store, died of kidney failure Thursday in Humana Biscayne Hospital in Miami. He was 88 years old.
        An obituary last Sunday about the executive vice president of a retail store in Middletown, Conn., misidentified him and the store. He was Bernard S. Wrubel of Wrubel's Inc. In some copies, because of a mechanical error, the obituary omitted a survivor. She was his wife, Ada, of Hallandale, Fla.
