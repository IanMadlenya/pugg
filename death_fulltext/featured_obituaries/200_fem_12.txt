        Catharine Crozier, a versatile organist who played at the inaugural concerts of the instruments at both Avery Fisher Hall and Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center, died Sept. 19 in Portland, Ore. She was 89.
        Ms. Crozier specialized in French music, ranging from Baroque composers like Nicolas de Grigny and Louis-Claude Daquin to 20th-century masters like Olivier Messiaen, Jehan Alain and Marcel Dupr√©.
        But she was equally adept with the classic German repertory and modern works by Paul Hindemith, Vincent Persichetti and others.
        Ms. Crozier was one of the most visible concert organists of the last half-century and was chosen as one of the players to christen the new organ at Philharmonic Hall -- now called Avery Fisher Hall -- in 1962, along with E. Power Biggs and Virgil Fox. (The organ was removed during a renovation in 1976.) She also performed at the dedication of the Alice Tully Hall organ in 1975.
        In a review of the Alice Tully Hall concert, Allen Hughes of The New York Times called Ms. Crozier a ''symbol of uncompromising quality among organ virtuosos.''
        Ms. Crozier, who was born in Hobart, Okla., attended the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, where she received a bachelor's degree in 1936 and both a master's degree and an Artist's Diploma in 1941.
        She made her debut at the Washington National Cathedral in 1941 and was the chair of the organ department at Eastman from 1953 to 1955, when her husband, Harold Gleason, an organ professor at Eastman, retired.
        In addition to performing, Ms. Crozier edited several editions of ''Method of Organ Playing,'' a textbook by her husband. The book's most recent edition was the eighth, in 1995. Mr. Gleason died in 1980.
        In 1993 Ms. Crozier moved to Portland, where she was artist in residence at Trinity Episcopal Cathedral until early this year.
        There are no immediate survivors.
