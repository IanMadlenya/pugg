        Ralph Strait, a character actor who appeared in plays, feature films, television dramas and commercials, died on Friday at Beekman Downtown Hospital in Manhattan. He was 56 years old and lived on Staten Island.
        Jan Kirshner, a spokeswoman for his family, said he died of a heart attack.
        Mr. Strait was probably best known to the public as "Pride," the portly, jovial half of the "Price and Pride" commercials in the 1970's for A & P supermarkets. The popular commercials, in which Ted Pugh, another veteran actor, played "Price," overshadowed Mr. Strait's other work.
        In the 1960's, he was a member of the Washington (D.C.) Theater Club, and played leading roles in works by Harold Pinter, Edward Albee, Lanford Wilson and others. On television he appeared in "Magnum, P.I.," "Trapper John, M.D." and "Hart to Hart."
        Mr. Strait is survived by a daughter, Kathleen, of Mesa, Ariz., and a sister, Georgia Bogardus Holof of Manhattan.
