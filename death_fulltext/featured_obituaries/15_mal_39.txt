        John Glessner Lee, a pioneering aviation research engineer who was instrumental in the founding of the University of Hartford, died at a nursing home here Thursday. He was 89 years old and lived in Stonington, Conn.
        He was a project engineer for the Fairchild airplane, which was built in the 1920's and was used by Rear Adm. Richard E. Byrd when he explored Antarctica.
        Mr. Lee was also chief engineer for the Ford tri-motor airplane, one of the first transport aircraft in the United States, and he was project engineer for the first low-wing planes used by the Navy.
        He joined the United Aircraft Corporation in 1932 as an aeronautical engineer and retired in 1964 as director of research for the company, which is now the United Technologies Corporation.
        Mr. Lee was a civic leader for years in the Hartford area. He persuaded members of the boards of three Hartford schools - Hillyer College, the Hartt College of Music and the Hartford Art School - to combine to form the University of Hartford in 1957, and he was named the first chairman of the board of the combined institution.
        After his retirement from United Aircraft, he became a consultant for a short time for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration at the request of James Webb, its administrator.
        Mr. Lee was born in Chicago. He earned a master's degree in mechanical engineering in 1921 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
        He is survived by his wife, Percy; two sons, John Maxim, of Bloomfield, Conn., and Hamilton, of Mystic; two daughters, Percy Lee Langstaff of Stamford, Conn., and Frances Lee Heminway of West Simsbury, Conn.; nine grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
