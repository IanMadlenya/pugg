        Valentina Brodsky Chagall, the second wife of the artist Marc Chagall and heir to an extensive collection of his paintings, died on Wednesday at her home in St.-Paul-de-Vence in southern France. She was 88.
        She had been ill for a long time, her family said.
        Mrs. Chagall, who was a native of Kiev, Ukraine, and was known as Vava, married the artist in 1952 after helping him recover from the death of his first wife in 1944. Chagall died in 1985 at the age of 97, and she became the heir to half of his estate.
        She is survived by a brother, Michel Brodsky of Paris.
