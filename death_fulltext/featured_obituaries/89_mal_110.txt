        Jess B. Bessinger Jr., a retired professor of English at New York University who was an expert on Beowulf, the longest poem surviving in Old English, died on Thursday in his home in Middletown, R.I. He was 72.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his sister, Elaine Fay.
        Professor Bessinger taught at N.Y.U. from 1964 until he retired in 1992. He was the editor of the book "A Concordance to Beowulf" (1969, Cornell) and a co-editor of the book "Approaches to Teaching Beowulf" (1983, Modern Language).
        It has been suggested that Beowulf, which is 3,182 lines long, was composed in the Eighth century. It is partly about fighting between its hero, Beowulf, and a water monster.  Old English was the tongue of the English nation before 1066.
        Born in Detroit and raised in Houston, Professor Bessinger earned a B.A. in 1943 from what is now Rice University, served in the Army from 1943 to 1946, and received M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in English from Harvard. He taught at Brown University and at University College in Toronto before joining the New York University faculty.
        His marriages to the former Barbara Ives Damon and the former Elizabeth Lieber DuVally ended in divorce.
        In addition to his sister, Mrs. Fay of Chappell Hill, Tex., his survivors include two sons, Anthony D., of Newport, R.I., and Jay B., of Portsmouth, R.I., and a granddaughter.
