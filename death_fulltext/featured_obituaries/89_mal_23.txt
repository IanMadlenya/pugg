        Alfred F. Moran, chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood of New York City from 1966 until 1989, died on Sunday at his home on Martha's Vineyard, Mass. He was 67 and formerly lived in Bedford Hills, N.Y.
        The cause of death was pulmonary fibrosis, his family said.
        Mr. Moran was the first to head the New York component of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America when it was formed. He started his tenure by merging six local operations, eventually absorbing the Margaret Sanger Research Bureau and other family-planning programs.
        At his retirement in 1989, the New York City organization had an annual budget of $12 million, a staff of 250 and three reproductive health-care clinics visited by 50,000 women a year.
        "This is a game for young people," he said on retiring. He recalled that when he first started at Planned Parenthood, everything was a struggle, from availability of contraceptives to women's rights. 'Considerable Influence'
        His skills as an administrator, tactician and witness before Congress and other public bodies were generally conceded by adversaries.
        "I think Planned Parenthood is morally incorrect, but as a strategist I would have to give him pretty high marks," said Dr. John C. Willke, president of the National Right to Life Committee at the time of Mr. Moran's withdrawal from the fray. "He is a man of considerable influence in their policy formation."
        Mr. Moran, a native of the Bronx, attended City College and graduated in social science from the New School for Social Research. He joined Planned Parenthood after five years as executive director of the Arthritis Foundation. Before that he was associated with the Community Service Society.
        He is survived by his wife of 47 years, Corinne Silver Moran; a daughter, Carol, of Jamaica, Queens, and two sons, Brian, of Manhattan, and Brad, of Cambridge, Mass.
