        Ignace Strasfogel, a pianist, composer and conductor, died on Sunday at the Jewish Home and Hospital for Aged. He was 84 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, said his son Ian.
        In a career that spanned seven decades, Mr. Strasfogel conducted many of the world's best-known opera companies and orchestras. He was appointed assistant conductor of the New York Philharmonic in 1944 after several years as the orchestra's official pianist. From 1951 to 1974, he was a resident conductor of the Metropolitan Opera, where he led performances of more than 20 operas from a wide-ranging repertory.
        He also was a guest conductor at the Chicago Symphony, the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande and the Berlin State Opera. He appeared regularly at the Cincinnati Summer Opera and other music festivals.
        Mr. Strasfogel was born in Warsaw in 1909 and studied piano in Berlin. He began his career as a pianist and was an accompanist for Joseph Szigeti, Gregor Piatigorsky, Lauritz Melchior and other soloists. As a composer, he won the Mendelssohn State Prize in Berlin for his piano sonata when he was 17. He came to the United States in 1933. In addition to conducting, he taught at the New School and was director of the opera department at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.
        In addition to his son Ian, of Manhattan, he is survived by another son, Andrew Leigh, of Bethesda, Md., and three grandchildren.
