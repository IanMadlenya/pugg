        Cyril M. Schneider, an advertising and communications executive for more than 40 years in Manhattan and Los Angeles, died on Tuesday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. Mr. Schneider, who lived in Manhattan, was 64.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Jackie Schneider.
        For the last 10 years Mr. Schneider was an executive with Bozell Worldwide, an advertising agency in New York, serving since 1988 as its corporate executive vice president. Before that he had been a vice president and general manager of Nickelodeon, a cable television network for children, which he helped found.
        Mr. Schneider started in the advertising business with Carson/Roberts in Los Angeles in 1953. He was president from 1964 until 1970, when it was acquired by Ogilvy & Mather, for which he worked for the next decade.
        Mr. Schneider was the author of "Children's Television: The Art, the Business and How it Works," (1987) which was a widely acclaimed examination of the subject. He also wrote many magazine articles about television programming and advertising for children.
        He was a journalism graduate of the University of Southern California and had a master's degree in American literature from New York University.
        He is survived by his wife; three daughters, Alexandra, of Manhattan, and Jenny and Kate, both of Los Angeles, and two sons, Marc, of Santa Ynez, Calif., and Gregory, of Ann Arbor, Mich.
