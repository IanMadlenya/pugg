        Owen Bradford Butler, who was chairman of the Procter & Gamble Company for much of the 1980's, died on Tuesday at his home in Denver.
        He was 74 and the cause of his death was cancer, the company said.
        Mr. Butler was born in Lynchburg, Va., and joined Procter & Gamble in 1945 in the sales department. He rose through the ranks, holding various positions in sales management, including head of the Cincinnati-based company's soap department. He became manager of the food products division in 1967 and was promoted the following year to vice president for sales of the entire company.
        In 1972 Mr. Butler was appointed to the board and was promoted in 1974 to vice chairman. In 1981, he became chairman of Procter & Gamble, which makes Tide laundry detergent, Crest toothpaste and Pampers diapers. He retired in 1986.
        Mr. Butler was also an advocate for children's issues. In 1982, he was chairman of the National Committee for Economic Development, an organization of economists and business leaders. In 1985, the committee published ''Investing in Our Children,'' a policy statement that became a blueprint for national business and public education alliances.
        He moved to Denver in the mid-1990's, where he led a statewide initiative to improve children's lives, Bright Beginnings.
        Mr. Butler is survived by his wife, Erna; a daughter, Nancy Accetta; a son, Jim, and four grandchildren, all of Denver.
