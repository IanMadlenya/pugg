        Joan Merrill, a nightclub singer and actress, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 74 years old.
        She died of a stroke, said her husband, Israel Seeger.
        Miss Merrill was a featured actress and singer in several movies, among them "Time Out for Rhythm" (1941) and "Iceland" (1942), in which she introduced the song "There Will Never Be Another You," which became a pop standard.
        Miss Merrill was born in Baltimore. She began her career in the 1930's on radio and later sang in nightclubs across the country, including the Copacabana in New York, the Thunderbird Hotel in Las Vegas, Nev., and the Rio Cabana in Chicago.
        She is survived, in addition to her husband, by two sons, William and Michael, both of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.
