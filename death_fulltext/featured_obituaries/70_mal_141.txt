        Dr. Leo H. Criep, who did research on allergies and asthmatic conditions, died Thursday at his home in Pittsburgh. He was 96 years old.
        He died of cancer of the prostate, said his daughter, Susan C. Santa-Cruz of Pittsburgh.
        Dr. Criep was associated with the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine for 60 years, working ina variety of posts. In 1989 he was named a Distinguished University Professor Emeritus. He practiced medicine until four years ago.
        Dr. George M. Bernier Jr., the dean of the medical school, said yesterday that Dr. Criep was "one of the founding fathers of clinical immunology, a very broad discipline that includes the study of allergies and asthmatic conditions, which was the area that he particularly focused on."
        Dean Bernier said that in the 1920's and 1930's, Dr. Criep "made numerous contributions through research to basic understanding of allergies and asthmatic conditions."
        He was a frequent contributor to medical journals and won many awards. His books included "Essentials of Allergy" (Lippincott, 1945) and "Clinical Immunology and Allergy" (Grune & Stratton, 1962).
        Over the years he was on the staffs of the Veterans Hospital in Pittsburgh and several other hospitals.
        Dr. Criep, born in Romania, was taken to the United States as a boy and grew up in Pittsburgh. He earned a bachelor of science degree at the University of Pittsburgh and his medical degree there as well, in 1920.
        In addition to his daughter, Dr. Criep is survived by his wife of 52 years, the former Merla Rosenfield; a son, Dr. Leo H. Criep Jr. of Houston, and a granddaughter.
