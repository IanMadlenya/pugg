        William Harold Cox, a Federal district judge who enraged civil rights advocates with his remarks about blacks but presided over a 1967 trial that convicted eight members of the Ku Klux Klan of killing three civil rights workers, died Thursday at his home here. He was 87 years old.  Judge Cox, the son of a Sunflower County sheriff, had a successful practice in corporate and civil law before being named to the Federal bench in 1961. He was an active judge until 1983.
        In the course of his judicial career, Judge Cox was attacked by the National Assocation for the Advancement of Colored People and others for his remarks about blacks, segregation and civil rights.
        Judge Cox, criticizing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, said in court, ''I don't know anybody down here who don't oppose it.''
        In 1967, Judge Cox presided over the trial of eight Klansmen charged in the 1964 murders of three civil rights workers in Philadelphia, Miss. After the jury seemed deadlocked for two days, Judge Cox ordered them to come up with a verdict. The jury found the men guilty.
        He is survived by a son and a daughter.
