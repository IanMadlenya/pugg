        Catherine Damon Christy, a former president of the Young Women's Christian Association of Brooklyn and a former member of the boards of various charitable organizations, died on Wednesday at her home in Wilton, Conn. She was 96 and formerly lived in Brooklyn Heights.
        The cause was cardiac arrest. She had been suffering from arteriosclerotic heart disease, said Joseph Pagliaro of the Hoyt Funeral Home in New Canaan, Conn.
        Mrs. Christy did volunteer work for years with the Brooklyn Y.W.C.A. and was its president from 1944 to 1953. She was also a longtime member of its board.
        In addition, she was a member of the national Y.W.C.A. board from 1947 to 1967 and was variously a member of its executive committee, its committee on racial inclusiveness and other panels.
        Mrs. Christy also served on the boards of the Visiting Nurse Association of Brooklyn and the Brooklyn Bureau of Social Service, and was secretary of the National United Service Organization from 1957 to 1968.
        A native of Pulaski, Va., she received a Bachelor of Science degree from Simmons College in Boston in 1920 and was later employed as a librarian.
        She married Francis T. Christy, a lawyer, in 1922. He died in 1979.
        She is survived by two sons, Arthur H. of Manhattan and Dr. Francis T. Christy of Washington; five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.
