        J. Wayne Reitz, a former president of the University of Florida, died on Friday at Shands Hospital here. He was 84 and lived in Gainesville.
        The cause was respiratory failure after a gall bladder infection, his family said.
        Dr. Reitz was the fifth president of the university, and the student union building bears his name. For the past 20 years, he worked at the University of Florida Foundation to raise money for the university.
        He was born in Olathe, Kan., in 1908 and earned degrees from Colorado State University, the University of Illinois and the University of Wisconsin.
        Trained as an agricultural economist, he taught at Colorado State, Illinois and Florida before being named president at Florida in 1955. He resigned in 1967.
        He paved the way with the Board of Control, the predecessor of the current Board of Regents, for doctorate programs that formed the nucleus for several research programs, one of which was the precursor of the university's medical school.
        He also guided the peaceful racial integration of the university in 1958 after a Federal court order.
        Dr. Reitz is survived by his wife, the former Frances Huston Millikan; two daughters, Marjorie Turnbull of Tallahassee, Fla., and Margo Cooke of Huntingdon, Tenn.; two sisters, Nadine Beals of San Diego and Flossie Donovan of Gardner, Kan., and three grandsons.
