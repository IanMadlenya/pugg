        Mr. Lucioni painted with precision and conviction and had considerable success early in his career. By popular vote, he won the first prize at the 1939 Carnegie International Exhibition for his portrait of Ethel Waters. Also by popular vote, paintings of his won first prize at the Corcoran Biennials of 1939, 1941, 1947 and 1949.
        He was born in 1900 in Malnate, in northern Italy, near Milan, and came to the United States when he was 10 years old. He studied at Cooper Union and the National Academy of Design, where he became a full member.
        For his sharply observed paintings of the hills, trees and houses of Vermont, he was at one time called that state's painter laureate.
        He loved opera and painted portraits of many opera stars, including Arturo Toscanini. He played the piano himself.
        Mr. Lucioni's work is in the collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. There were no survivors.  A funeral Mass will be said at 10:30 this morning at St. Rocco's Roman Catholic Church in Union City, N.J.
