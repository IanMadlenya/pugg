        Laurence W. Beilenson, a lawyer who helped establish the Screen Actors Guild and other Hollywood unions in the 1930's, died of a stroke Monday. He was 89 years old and lived in Los Angeles.
        Mr. Beilenson, whom President Reagan described as a ''good friend'' in a 1981 commencement address at the United States Military Academy at West Point, helped organize the original Screen Writers Guild, the Screen Actors Guild, the Directors Guild of America and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.
        The writers' guild later became the Writers Guild of America.
        Mr. Beilenson was a staff lawyer for the actors' guild from its start in 1933 and helped negotiate its first contract with film producers in 1937.
        Among his show business clients were Mr. Reagan, Greta Garbo and Groucho Marx.
        Mr. Beilenson served as a major in World War II.
        After retiring from the actors' guild in 1949, he served as legal counsel to MCA Artists Ltd. Mr. Beilenson also was an adviser to Mr. Reagan in his early political career and wrote three books, ''The Treaty Trap,'' ''Power Through Subversion'' and ''Survival and Peace in the Nuclear Age.''
        In the West Point commencement address, Mr. Reagan cited ''The Treaty Trap'' and noted, ''It makes plain that no nation that placed its faith in parchment or paper, while at the same time it gave up its protective hardware, ever lasted long enough to write many pages in history.''
