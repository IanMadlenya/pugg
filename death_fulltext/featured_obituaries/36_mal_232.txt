        Blair Bolles, a retired journalist, author and corporate executive, died of liver cancer Friday at his home in Bethesda, Md. He was 78 years old.
        He was a reporter and diplomatic correspondent for The Washington Star in the 1930's and into the 1940's and later was the Washington bureau chief and correspondent of the Foreign Policy Association for a decade.
        Mr. Bolles was then, for more than a decade, a vice president of Fairbanks, Morse & Company and its successor, Colt Industries, serving as a consultant until 1986.
        Among his books was ''How to Get Rich in Washington: Rich Man's Division of the Welfare State'' (1952), which Cabell Phillips of The New York Times hailed as ''one of the most convincing and effective recitals of mass corruption to be published in many years.''
        Other books he wrote included ''The Big Change in Europe'' (1958), an account of the growth and meaning of the consumer revolution in Western Europe, and ''Tyrant From Illinois,'' a 1951 biography of Joe Cannon, a ruthless House Speaker.
        Edmund Blair Bolles was a native of St. Louis and a graduate of Phillips Exeter Academy and Yale University. At The Washington Star, he covered the White House and the State Department and was a wartime correspondent, based in neutral Stockholm, reporting on the Axis Powers. He wrote for many publications, including The St. Louis Post Dispatch, The Toledo Blade, The New York Times and other newspapers and national magazines, as well as being the president of The American Newspaper Guild.
        His wife of 48 years, the former Mona Dugas, died in August. Surviving are three sons, Blair Jr., of Manhattan, DeVallon, of Winchester, Mass., and Harry, of Brooklyn; a daughter, Zoe, of Gourdon, France, and seven grandchildren.
