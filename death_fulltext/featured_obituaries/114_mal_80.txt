        Dr. William Dixon Mayer, a pathologist who was president of Eastern Virginia  Medical School in Norfolk from 1979 to 1986, died on June 30 in Virginia Beach.  He was 67 and lived in Virginia Beach.
        The cause was lung cancer, said the National Board of Medical Examiners, with which Dr. Mayer had been associated for 30 years.
        He retired in 1986, after overseeing a period of growth at the medical school, where enrollment grew to 369, from 219, and the full-time faculty rose to 194, from 122.
        Dr. Mayer, who was born in Beaver Falls, Pa., graduated from Colgate University in 1951 and received his medical degree in 1957 at the University of  Rochester, where he also trained in pathology.
        He joined the University of Missouri School of Medicine in 1961 and became its dean in 1967. Dr. Mayer took a leave in 1966-67 to help organize the Federal Regional Medical Programs, whose purpose was to relay word of new medical treatments and related information to doctors and hospitals across the nation.
        From 1976 to 1979 he was assistant chief medical director for academic affairs at the Veterans Administration in Washington.
        Dr. Mayer's survivors include his wife, Donna Dashiell Mayer; two daughters,  Elizabeth Bradshaw of Roanoke, Va., and Katherine Dashiell of Chapel Hill, N.C., and two sons, David D., of St. Simons Island, Ga., and William D. Jr., of Chesapeake, Va.
