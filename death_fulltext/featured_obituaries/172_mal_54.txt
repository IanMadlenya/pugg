        Sheldon Oliensis, who was president of the City Bar Association from 1988 to 1990 and headed other New York law organizations, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 79.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Lyn.
        He was a partner for more than three decades in the Manhattan-based law firm now called Kaye Scholer LLP, specializing in litigation, arbitration and mediation.
        He was president of the Legal Aid Society from 1973 to 1975 and chairman of the New York City Conflicts of Interest Board from 1990 to 1998.
        A native of Philadelphia, he graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and from Harvard Law School, where he was president of the Harvard Law Review.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, John, of Manhattan; two daughters, Jane, of Assisi, Italy, and Ellen, of Berkeley, Calif.; a sister, Doris Woldow of Philadelphia; and four grandchildren.
