        Walter H. Page, a former chairman and president of J. P. Morgan & Company, died Jan. 8 at his home in Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. He was 83.
        The cause of death was heart failure, said his son Mark.
        Mr. Page joined the company as a trainee in 1937, when it was still a privately held bank, and remained there until he retired in 1979.
        Mr. Page worked in domestic banking early in his career, rising to the position of assistant treasurer in 1948 and vice president in 1953. Morgan merged with the Guaranty Trust Company in 1959, and Mr. Page was named senior vice president of the new company, Morgan Guaranty Trust, in 1964. The following year, he was appointed executive vice president in charge of the international banking division.
        ''Mr. Page was one of the last bank executives to have worked under John Pierpont Morgan Jr.,'' said D. W. Wright, the company historian and a consultant to J. P. Morgan. He played a key role in shaping the company's international strategy,  Mr. Wright said, especially in the 1960's and early 1970's, a period when United States banks were expanding their overseas business.
        In 1968, Mr. Page became a vice chairman of Morgan Guaranty and was named to the corporate office, the company's senior management group. In 1969, J. P. Morgan, a holding company, was formed to acquire Morgan Guaranty Trust. Mr. Page was named vice chairman of J. P. Morgan that year and president of both companies in 1971. He became chairman in 1978.
        In the 1970's, Mr. Page helped create the plan that led to the formation of the Saudi International Bank. ''The relationship between Morgan and the Saudi central bank was considered a great coup for the Morgan firm,'' Mr. Wright said.
        When Mr. Page retired in 1979, the company had more than 20 offices overseas.
        He remained on the board and in 1985 was named a member of an advisory group to top management at the company.
        Mr. Page, born in Huntington, N.Y., graduated from Harvard College in 1937.
        He married Jane Nichols, the granddaughter of John Pierpont Morgan Jr., in 1942. He served in the Navy during World War II.
        Mrs. Page died on Dec. 15. Mr. Page is survived by a daughter, Jane Mallinson of Exeter, N.H.; two sons, Walter of Lincoln, Mass., and Mark of Brooklyn, and eight grandchildren.
