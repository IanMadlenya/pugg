        Joseph Dunn, a director in experimental theater, died on Sept. 16 at his home in Hopewell Junction, N.Y. He was 63.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Jeffrey Allen, a member of Mr. Dunn's theater company.
        Mr. Dunn was born in Cleveland. With Irja Koljonen, his companion and collaborator, he founded the 2 Bleecker Street Theater in Manhattan in the late 1960's. Later he renamed his company the American Contemporary Theater and moved to Buffalo.
        He made his initial reputation in Buffalo in 1972 with his dramatization of Samuel Beckett's novel ''The Unnamable,'' for which he had the permission of the author. Subsequently, he and Ms. Koljonen created original work, specializing in environmental theater.
        ''Preface,'' a soundless light show, was presented in Manhattan as part of the Bunch Festival '77. Among his other theater pieces are ''Purge,'' ''Calm'' and ''Remains.''
        In the early 1980's, Mr. Dunn left the theater and later opened a fitness club. Recently, he was contemplating his return to the stage.
        He is survived by Ms. Koljonen.
