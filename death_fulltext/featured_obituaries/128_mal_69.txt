        Samuel Lurie, a veteran dance and music publicity agent, died on Sept. 11 at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. He was 88 and lived in West Hollywood.
        Mr. Lurie died after a brief illness, said Stanley Kaminsky, his longtime business associate and companion of 43 years.
        Mr. Lurie, who grew up in New York City, was known for his quick, acerbic wit, which often surfaced in exchanges with friends that included Lorenz Hart and Dorothy Parker. Mr. Lurie represented Ballet Theater, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, the Actors Studio and, in California, the Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena.
