        Dr. Joel D. Meyers, a leading researcher of infections caused by suppression of the immune system in organ transplant and AIDS patients, died Oct. 27 at Swedish Hospital in Seattle. He was 46 years old and lived in Mercer Island, Wash.
        He died of colon cancer, his family said.
        He headed the infectious diseases and virology program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and was a medical school professor at the University of Washington.
        Dr. Meyers was an international leader in his studies, said Dr. E. Donnall Thomas, a 1990 Nobel laureate, adding that his work led to the prevention of cytomegalovirus and other herpes infections after transplants of organs and bone marrow, thus improving survival rates.
        Born in Detroit, Dr. Meyers was a graduate of Dartmouth College and Harvard Medical School. He was an intern and resident at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.
        In 1972 he moved to Atlanta to work for the Federal Centers for Disease Control in immunization. He went to Seattle in 1975 as a medical school fellow and joined the University of Washington faculty in 1977. He joined the research center in 1978 and was promoted to his current job in 1982.
        He is survived by his wife, Barbara Thrasher-Meyers, and a brother, Dr. Robert A. Meyers of Manhattan.
