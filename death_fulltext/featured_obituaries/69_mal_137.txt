        William Moore, a critic and scholar who specialized in black dance, died on Saturday at his home in New York City. He was 59 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, said his sister Margaret Moore.
        Mr. Moore, who was born in Manhattan, was influential in the careers of black modern dancers and dance companies, giving advice and helping them find performing space and money. He became involved in dance as a performer and critic in the 1960's, later managing the dance companies of Eleo Pomare and Joan Miller.
        He participated in the creation of the Association of Black Choreographers in 1967 and was affiliated with the Black Theater Alliance. Mr. Moore founded Dance Herald, a journal about black dance, in 1975. It ceased publication in 1979.  A Frequent Panelist
        He was a lecturer and panelist for the Black Tradition in American Modern Dance project of the American Dance Festival, lectured on dance history and criticism at Lehman College and the Alvin Ailey American Dance Center, and was a member of the dance panel of the New York State Council on the Arts. Mr. Moore helped put together the "100 Years of Jazz and Blues Festival" at the Brooklyn Academy of Music this year, and participated in conferences of the International Black Dance Companies, Black Choreographers Moving Toward the 21st Century and the Festival of American Folklore at the Smithsonian Institution.
        Mr. Moore's reviews and feature articles appeared in magazines including Dance Scope, Crisis and Talking Drums. He had recently received a Fulbright Fellowship to study the folk dances of Brazil next year.
        In addition to his sister, he is survived by another sister, Pearl Lapsley.  Both are of New York City.
