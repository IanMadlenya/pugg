        Frank A. Scioscia, a former publishing executive who ran a popular bookstore in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., died on July 10 at New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 71 and lived in Hastings-on-Hudson.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Since 1976 Mr. Scioscia had operated the Riverrun bookstore, a shop with 300,000 volumes of used and rare books. The store became an informal cultural center with poetry readings, meetings, impromptu discussions, seminars and a weekly hootenanny session for folk-song fans. The singer Pete Seeger, the artist Shel Silverstein and editors and writers were among the patrons and visitors.
        Mr. Scioscia was born in Scranton, Pa. He was a graduate of Reed College.
        Surviving are his wife of 47 years, the former Mary Hershey; two sons, John of Gainesville, Fla., and Charles of Hastings-on-Hudson; two daughters, Louisa Stephens and Virginia Vazirani, both of Hastings-on-Hudson; two brothers, Carl of Scranton and John Socia of Somerville, N.J.; three sisters, Theresa Scaccia of Scranton, Ann Bufano of Baltimore and Virginia Ranken of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
