        John Coert Campbell, a former member of the State Department's policy planning council and director of political studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, died on Sunday at his home in Cohasset, Mass. He was 88.
        Mr. Campbell, a political scientist, wrote extensively on the Middle East and American foreign policy.
        He was a consultant and adviser to the State Department from 1963 to 1980 and a member of its policy planning council in 1967, while the Arab-Israeli war was going on, and in 1968.
        In the 1960's he also served on an advisory panel for the State Department's Bureau of Near East and South Asian Affairs.
        His earlier State Department posts included specialist in Eastern Europe from 1942 to 1946. He was officer in charge of Balkan affairs and a member of the policy planning staff from 1949 to 1955.
        In his 27 years as a senior staff member of the Manhattan-based Council on Foreign Relations, he drew on his firsthand experience in making policy to provide analyses of world affairs. He was the council's director of political studies from 1955 to 1962, senior research fellow from 1962 to 1978 and director of studies from 1977 until 1978, when he retired.
        His writings on the Middle East include the books ''The West and the Middle East'' (1972), written with Helen Caruso, and ''Defense of the Middle East'' (1958).
        In a 1982 essay on the Middle East, he wrote, ''Every new administration needs time to find its footing in foreign affairs, especially in a complex and changing area like the Middle East, and the Reagan team has taken as much or more time than its predecessors.'' He added philosophically, ''Earlier administrations, after all, broke their heads on these same issues.''
        He was on the board of governors of the Middle East Institute.
        Among his writings on Eastern Europe are the books ''American Foreign Policy Toward Communist Eastern Europe'' (1965, Books on Demand) and ''Tito's Separate Road'' (1967). He won an award in 1980, for contributing to Slavic studies, from the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies.
        A native New Yorker, he received a bachelor's degree, a master's degree and a doctorate, all from Harvard. His doctoral dissertation was on Romania.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary, whom he married in 1936; two sons, Allan R., of Auburndale, Mass., and A. Bruce, of Denver; and three grandchildren.
