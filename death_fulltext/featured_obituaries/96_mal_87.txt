        Lawrence J. O'Brien, former chief executive of one of the nation's largest suppliers of commercial and residential security systems, died last Thursday at the Hospice of Northern Virginia in Arlington, Va. He was 81.
        The cause was lung cancer, said Martin McLaughlin, a family friend.
        Mr. O'Brien was a son of John P. O'Brien, who was elected Mayor of New York in 1933 to fill the remainder of Mayor James J. Walker's second term after Walker resigned amid a state investigation of corruption charges.
        The younger Mr. O'Brien graduated from Georgetown University and began his career as a salesman for the International Business Machines Corporation. After serving in the Army in World War II, he began working as a special assistant to the chairman for what became ADT Security Systems Inc., now a subsidiary of the ADT Group PLC.
        He was promoted to general sales manager in 1956 and rose steadily through the executive ranks; in 1970 he was named chairman and chief executive.
        He is survived by two sons, John, of Monterey, Mass., and Kevin, of McLean, Va.; a daughter, Irene Harlow of Springfield, Va.; a brother, Gerald, of Somers, N.Y.; a sister, Betty Forker of Venice, Fla., and five grandchildren.
