        Lawrence Pomeroy, a former New York City lawyer who devoted his retirement to conservation activities on Block Island, R.I., died on Friday at Newport Hospital in Rhode Island. He was 79 years old and had lived in New Rochelle, N.Y., for many years before moving to Newport.
        Mr. Pomeroy died of bone cancer, said a son, Lawrence K. Pomeroy.
        Mr. Pomeroy was a partner with the New York firm of Palmer, Serles, Delaney, Shaw & Pomeroy from its formation in the early 1950's until his retirement in 1970.
        In Newport, Mr. Pomeroy worked to control development on Block Island and fought utility rate increases.
        Mr. Pomeroy graduated from the Lawrence School in 1930, Yale in 1934 and Harvard Law School in 1938.
        During World War II he served as an intelligence officer with the Army Air Corps in Britain. In 1948, with two Harvard Law School classmates, he formed the law firm of Shaw, Delaney & Pomeroy, which later merged with the New York firm of Palmer & Delaney to form the firm that Mr. Pomeroy was associated with until his retirement in 1970.
        Mr. Pomeroy is survived by his wife, Aloyise; two sons, Lawrence K., of Manhattan, and Joseph B., of Belmont, Mass.; a brother, Braman, of Tequesta, Fla., and a sister, Josephine A., of Westwood, Mass.
