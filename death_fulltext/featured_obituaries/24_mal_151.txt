        Professor Goldstein, a native of Hull, England, was Gordon McKay Professor of Applied Mathematics Emeritus in the division of engineering and applied physics at Harvard University, from which he retired in 1970.
        He was also the former president and chairman of the board of the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa.
        Professor Goldstein was an adviser to the United States and Britain on aircraft and allied matters in World War II. From 1946 to 1949 he was chairman of the Aeronautics Research Council of Great Britain.
        In 1950 he left England to become professor of applied mathematics and chairman of the department of aeronautic engineering at the institute in Israel, where he stayed until 1954, when he began his career at Harvard as a visiting lecturer.
        After World War II he was named a Fellow of the Royal Society of Great Britain, one of the youngest persons to be so honored. In 1965 he was awarded the Timoshenko Medal of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.
        He graduated from St. John's College, Cambridge, in 1925, and later earned M.A. and Ph.D. degrees there.
        He is survived by his wife, Dr. Rosa Sass Goldstein; a son, Dr. David Goldstein of Belmont, Mass.; a daughter, Ruth Donner of Helsinki, Finland; three grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
