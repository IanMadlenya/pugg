        Mr. Harris, who also served in the Florida House from 1957 to 1961, died Thursday.
        Mr. Harris prosecuted Clarence Earl Gideon for breaking into a pool hall here in 1961. Mr. Gideon was convicted and sent to prison, but the Supreme Court overturned the verdict because he had not had a lawyer.
        Mr. Harris is survived by his wife, five children, his mother and a brother.
