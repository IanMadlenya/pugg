        Bartholomew J. Viviano, a lawyer who had been a college football star, died on Wednesday at his home in Sea Bright, N.J. He was 79 years old.
        He died of lung cancer, a spokesman for the family said.
        Mr. Viviano had been in private practice in Plainfield, N.J., until he retired and moved to Sea Bright in 1988.
        He was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., and Cornell University, where he was elected captain of the football team in 1932. In 1978, he was named a charter member of the Cornell University Athletic Hall of Fame.
        After graduation from Cornell Law School, he went to work for Whitman Ransome, a Manhattan law firm that is no longer in business. He then joined the Lehigh Valley Railroad, later becoming vice president and general counsel. When it merged with the Pennsylvania Railroad, he was named a vice president and Washington office manager. He retired from the railroad in 1971 to go into private practice.
        He served in Army ordnance in World War II and was in the Japanese occupation force. He was discharged with the rank of major.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Beulah Fisher; two daughters, Judith Golden of Pacific Palisades, Calif., and Patricia Kortis of Maplewood, N.J.; a son, Thomas of Mount Laurel, N.J., and six grandchildren.
        Correction:  July 28, 1990, Saturday, Late Edition - Final
        An obituary yesterday about Bartholomew J. Viviano, a lawyer, misidentified and incorrectly described a Manhattan law firm where he worked after graduating from law school in the 1930's. The firm is Whitman & Ransom; it continues to operate.
