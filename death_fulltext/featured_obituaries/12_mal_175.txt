        Tom Maloney, retired editor and publisher of U.S. Camera Annual, died of a heart attack Jan. 18 at his home in Cranbury, N.J. He was 83 years old.
        In 1935, Mr. Maloney, a native of La Crosse, Wis., founded the U.S. Camera Publishing Corporation, publisher of the annual and of monthly magazines for photographers, U.S. Camera and Camera 35.
        U.S. Camera Annual, which reported on the state of photography each year, helped to develop photojournalism as an important news medium.
        In the early 1970's, Mr. Maloney sold the corporation to the American Express Company, which ceased publication of the magazines as it began other publishing ventures.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Gunvor Alvins; five daughters, Patricia Jurka of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., Jill Brussels of Rye, N.Y., Judy Dormandy of Sparks, Nev., Lee Maloney of Fairhope, Ala., and Lorie Maloney of Queens; two sons, Peter, of Los Angeles and Daniel, of Lawrenceville, N.J.; seven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. Two sisters, Mary Funk and Evelyn Conway, both of La Crosse, also survive.
