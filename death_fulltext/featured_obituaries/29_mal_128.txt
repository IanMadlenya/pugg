        He was decorated for charging a machine-gun nest in France on July 4, 1918, when he was a 23-year-old corporal with the Army's 33d Division. For his heroism, he received not only the Medal of Honor but also the British Distinguished Conduct Medal and the Medaille Militaire and the Croix de Guerre from France.
