        Marshall W. Wiley, a retired career diplomat and expert on the Arab world who was Ambassador to Oman, died on Saturday at George Washington University Hospital in Washington. He was 72 and lived in Bethesda, Md.
        The cause was acute leukemia, said his wife, Marjorie.
        Mr. Wiley was Ambassador to Oman from 1978 to 1981, when he retired from the Foreign Service.
        He held the post in a sensitive period. The Iranian revolution ended in 1979, and the United States used Oman in staging the unsuccessful mission to rescue the American hostages in Teheran in 1980.
        Oman's location, on the Arabian peninsula's southeast corner, adjoining the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea, makes it strategically important to the West. It overlooks the Strait of Hormuz, gateway for oil tankers.
        By 1985 Oman had become one of Washington's most reliable allies in the Persian Gulf since the Iranian revolution. That tie was rooted in a security pact signed by Oman and the United States in 1980, while Mr. Wiley was Ambassador.
        He was born in Rockford, Ill., and grew up mainly there. In the 1940's he was in the Navy and received a bachelor's degree, a law degree and a master's degree in business adminstration, all from the University of Chicago.
        He joined the Foreign Service in 1958 and served in Yemen, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Iraq and Saudi Arabia before becoming Ambassador to Oman. He was a Washington-based lawyer from 1981 to 1991 and president of the United States-Iraq Business Forum, a trade association, from 1985 to 1990.
        Besides Mr. Wiley's wife of 40 years, the former Marjorie Keane, his survivors include three children, Dr. Steven Wiley of Libertyville, Ill., Dr. Douglas Wiley of Manhattan Beach, Calif. and Cynthia Wiley Coleman of Falls Church, Va.
