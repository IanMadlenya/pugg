        Jose Maria de Areilza y Martinez de Rodas, who was Franco's Ambassador to the United States in the 1950's but later soured on the Government and, after the dictator's death in 1975, served briefly as Foreign Minister, died on Sunday at his Madrid home. He was 88.
        As Foreign Minister from December 1975 to June 1976, Mr. de Areilza (pronounced ah-RAIL-thuh) toured foreign capitals to explain that a shift to democracy was afoot in Spain. But in July 1976 King Juan Carlos I announced the selection of a young reformer, Adolfo Suarez, as Prime Minister, bypassing the more experienced Mr. de Areilza, whom many considered the likely choice.
        Born in Portugalete on Aug. 3, 1909, to a wealthy family, he earned a law degree in 1932 at the University of Salamanca and ran unsuccessfully for Parliament in 1932 and 1936 on a platform seeking to restore the exiled King Alfonso XIII, who fled the Spanish Republic. When the Civil War began in 1936, Mr. de Areilza fought for General Franco, and in 1937 was appointed Mayor of the largest Basque city, Bilbao.
        It was the start of a close association with Franco, which led to increasingly important posts for Mr. de Areilza. He was Ambassador to Argentina from 1947 to 1950; to the United States from 1954 to 1960, and to France from 1960 to 1964.
        But in the mid-1960's he openly criticized the Government, arguing that the quickest, surest method to restore democracy in Spain was to bring back the monarchy. In 1966 he became the principal aide to Juan de Borbon, the exiled son of Spain's last king. But that association ceased in 1969 when Franco designated Juan de Borbon's son, Prince Juan Carlos, as his successor as head of state.
        After serving as Foreign Minister, in the late 1970's Mr. de Areilza helped found two conservative political parties, and he was elected to Parliament in 1979. In 1981 he was elected president of the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe, a largely ceremonial post.
        In addition to diplomacy, he wrote at least 10 books, mostly nonfiction, including ''Notebooks of the Transition'' (1983), about the return of democracy in Spain, and ''The Europe We Want'' (1986), a collection of essays on his vision of Europe.
        Mr. de Areilza was elected in 1987 to a chair at the Spanish Royal Academy, considered the guardian of the Spanish language and arbiter of the content of the academy's official dictionary.
        He is survived by three children.
