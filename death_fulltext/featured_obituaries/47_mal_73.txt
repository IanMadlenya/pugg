        Ray W. Heffernan, the chairman of the H. H. Brown Shoe Company, died on Saturday at his home in Rye, N.Y. He was 92 years old.
        He died of complications of leukemia, said his daughter Frances Rooney.
        In 1927, Mr. Heffernan acquired a nearly bankrupt shoe company in North Brookfield, Mass., and developed it into one of the largest shoe manufacturing concerns in the United States.
        A 1919 graduate of Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts, he served as chairman of the company for more than 50 years. He was a trustee of Rosemont College in Pennsylvania and of Anna Marie College in Paxton, Mass., a Knight of Malta and a Knight of the Holy Sepulchre, and was awarded honorary degrees from five colleges.
        He helped raise funds to build the 400-bed St. Vincent's Hospital in Worcester, Mass., and remained a strong supporter of the hospital. He was also on the advisory board of St. Vincent's Hospital in Harrison, N.Y.
        Besides Frances, of Greenwich, Conn., he is survived by another daughter, Clare Shlora of Rye; two sons, Paul, of Worcester, and John, of Rye; 23 grandchildren, and 23 great-grandchildren.
