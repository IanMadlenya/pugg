        Felix Landau, an art dealer who had owned a prestigious gallery in Los Angeles, died on Feb. 17 at his home in Garches, a suburb of Paris. He was 78.
        The cause was complications from diabetes, his family said.
        Mr. Landau married Mitzi Ruth Ander in 1948, and in 1951 they founded the Felix Landau Gallery in Los Angeles on La Cienega Boulevard that became the city's ''gallery row.''
        Through the gallery, Mr. Landau, who was born in Austria, made known to Los Angeles the work of the Austrian artists Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele.
        In the 1960's the gallery was a respected site for viewing contemporary and modern art. Over the years, it exhibited works by other prominent European artists, including Henry Moore, Pablo Picasso and Francis Bacon, as well as works by artists with links to California, like Sam Francis and Richard Diebenkorn.
        In 1971, Mr. Landau closed the gallery in Los Angeles and one he owned in New York City and became a Paris-based private art dealer.
        Felix Henry Landau was born in Vienna in 1924. In 1938, when German troops occupied Austria, he and his family fled and became New Yorkers. He attended City College and served in the Army in the Pacific theater during World War II. In 1948 he moved with his wife to Los Angeles. They divorced in the early 1970's.
        He is survived by his second wife, Elga Heinzen, a Swiss painter of some renown, whom he married in 1980; a sister, Hilde Landau Rhalter of Los Angeles; three sons from his first marriage, Jeffrey, Robert and Barry, all of Los Angeles; two grandsons; and a stepson, Mederic Nebinger of Garches.
