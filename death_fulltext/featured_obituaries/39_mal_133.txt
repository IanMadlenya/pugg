        John W. Hundley, a musical comedy singer and actor and a CBS television executive who was in charge of the network's office of censorship for nearly 20 years, died yesterday at his home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He was 90 years old.
        Until he retired in 1965, Mr. Hundley was editor of program practices, the CBS network's phrase covering program censorship. In the era of live television, shortly before a broadcast he would sit with performers who had a reputation for tippling to make sure they were sober, said his daughter, Sally Baer. He would also check necklines of women's dresses to make sure they where the network thought they should be.
        Mr. Hundley joined CBS in 1938. He rose from network announcer to various executive positions in programming and sales.
        On the Broadway stage, Mr. Hundley performed in musical comedies in the 1920's and 30's. In ''Spring Is Here'' (1929), which had a score by Rodgers and Hart, he introduced ''With a Song in My Heart.''
        Mr. Hundley is survived by his wife, Eleanor; his daughter, Sally Baer of Moorestown, N.J., two grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.
