        Burt Chernow, an art historian writer and teacher, died on Monday at his father's home in Deerfield Park, Fla. He was 63 and lived in Westport, Conn.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Chernow began his career as an art teacher in the Westport school system, and at his death was a professor at Housatonic Community-Technical College in Bridgeport, Conn. He was also the founder and director emeritus of the Housatonic Museum of Art and was instrumental in helping to build its collection by soliciting artists, collectors and friends for donations to the museum, which now houses more than 4,500 artworks. He had recently completed the reinstallation of the collection in the college's new campus in downtown Bridgeport.
        He wrote many articles and books about modern artists, and he was one of the founders of the Westport Arts Center.
        He is survived by his wife, Ann Chernow, an artist; three children from a previous marriage, Perrin Stein of Rye, N.Y., Paul Chernow of Austin, Tex., and Paige Chernow of Minneapolis; two stepsons, David Chenok of Oakland, Calif., and Daniel Chenok of Washington, and five grandchildren.
