        George M. McCorkle, a retired cryptographer, book publisher and biologist, died on Thursday at Yale-New Haven Hospital in Connecticut. He was 71.
        Dr. McCorkle, who lived in Hamden, Conn., died of complications following a stroke, his son, James, said.
        A native of Wise, Va., who later moved to Rochester, N.Y., Dr. McCorkle earned a bachelor's degree from Yale University in 1942. Thirty-three years later -- after serving as a Navy cryptographer and later as president of a book publishing company -- he earned a doctorate in biology from Yale. And from 1979 until 1991, he served as a molecular biologist in the genetics laboratory of Dr. Sidney Altman, a Nobel Prize laureate.
        Before his career in biology, Dr. McCorkle was president and chief executive officer of the R. R. Bowker Company, which publishes research and reference books. He began his career with Charles Scribner's Sons in 1946 and later was named a senior vice president and financial officer of New American Library, a paperback book publisher.
        When he was 11, Dr. McCorkle earned the distinction of being the youngest member ever admitted to the American Cryptogram Society. During World War II, Dr. McCorkle served in Naval intelligence as a cryptographer, attempting to break Japanese secret codes. He was called back to service in the Korean War.
        Besides his son, Dr. McCorkle is survived by his wife, Barbara Backus McCorkle of Hamden; two daughters, Judith Cole of Hamden and Katharine McCorkle of Mars, Pa.; five stepchildren, Frances Clymer of Cody, Wyo., Robert Backus of Burlington, Vt., and Oswald, Anthony and Richard Backus, all of Lawrence, Kan., and two grandchildren.
