        Michael L. Tarnopol, a vice chairman of Bear Stearns and chairman of its investment banking division, died Monday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. He was 68 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was prostate cancer, Bear Stearns said.
        In 1975, Mr. Tarnopol was lured away from Lehman Brothers, where he was a rising star, to run the international department at Bear Stearns, a job he held for a decade, said John Rosenwald, another Bear Stearns vice chairman.
        Mr. Tarnopol became a managing director when Bear Stearns changed from a partnership to a stock company in 1985.
        Mr. Tarnopol was born in Long Beach, N.Y., and grew up on Long Island. He graduated from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1958 and soon became a trainee at Lehman Brothers.
        He was vice chairman of the University of Pennsylvania board of trustees and was on the Wharton School Board of Overseers.
        After he learned he had cancer in 1994, he devoted both energy and money to cancer research and other cancer programs. He was a trustee of both the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and the Prostate Cancer Foundation, which was started by the financier Michael R. Milken.
        Mr. Tarnopol also was an avid polo player and a director of the United States Equestrian Team.
        Mr. Tarnopol is survived by his wife, the former Lynne Lichtenstein; two daughters, Lori Moore and Lisa Silverman; and four grandchildren, all of New York.
