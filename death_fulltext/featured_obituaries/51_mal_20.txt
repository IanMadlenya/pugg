        Robert J. Klausner, a founding partner of Klausner Associates, real-estate investors and developers, died on Saturday at White Plains Hospital. He was 72 years old and lived in Scarsdale, N.Y.
        He died of complications from Parkinson's disease, a family spokesman said.
        Mr. Klausner started the Manhattan-based partnership with his brother, Sheldon. It developed and altered more than 300 residential and commercial properties in the New York metropolitan area over more than 30 years. Mr. Klausner had previously been a partner of Home Properties, an apartment-house investment company.
        He was born in the Bronx and grew up in New Jersey, where he graduated from Bayonne High School and earned a Bachelor of Science degree at the Newark College of Engineering. He lived many years in Manhattan and was a former president of Mount Neboh Synagogue on the Upper West Side.
        Besides his brother, who lives in Manhattan, Mr. Klausner leaves two daughters, Marian, of Cambridge, Mass., and Andrea, of Manhattan; his mother, Sadie, of Manhattan, and a grandson.
