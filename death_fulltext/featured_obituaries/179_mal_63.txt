        Edward Willett Wagner, a professor of Korean studies at Harvard who founded its Korea Institute in 1981, died in Concord, Mass. on Dec. 7. He was 77 and lived in Lexington, Mass.
        He had Alzheimer's disease, The Boston Globe said.
        Professor Wagner, who retired in 1993, played an important role in fostering Korean studies at Harvard and elsewhere in the United States. As a scholar, he specialized in pre-modern Korean history.
        His influential 1975 book ''The Literati Purges: Political Conflict in Early Yi Korea'' (Harvard), was a discussion of the nature of the Korean monarchy and bureaucratic system early in the Choson dynasty, which lasted from 1392 to 1910.
        His major scholarly work after that book was a very detailed examination of the Korean aristocracy during the entire Choson dynasty. His pioneering research in that area was based on his study of the 15,000 men who passed the highest civil service examination during that era, based on genealogies. In that research he had a partner, Song Jun-ho.
        Professor Wagner joined Harvard's faculty in 1959. He was acting chairman and chairman of the department of East Asian languages and civilizations in the 1960's and 1970's and director of the Korea Institute from 1981 to 1993.
        Born in Cleveland, he was in the Army in Asia in World War II and then a civilian adviser to the American military government in Korea  from 1946 to 1948. He received bachelor's and master's degrees from Harvard, as well as his doctorate, in history and East Asian languages.
        His marriage to Leonore Uhlmann ended in divorce.
        He is survived by his wife, Namhi Kim Wagner; two sons, Robert Camner and J. Christopher Wagner, both of Washington State; three stepdaughters, Yunghi Choi of Washington, D.C., and Sokhi Choi Wagner and Sanghi Choi Wagner, both of Manhattan; four grandchildren; and a brother, John, of Brooklyn.
