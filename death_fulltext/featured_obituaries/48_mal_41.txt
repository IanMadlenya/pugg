        John C. Oxtoby, professor emeritus of mathematics at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, died Wednesday at his home in Haverford, Pa. He was 80 years old.
        Professor Oxtoby died of cancer, a spokeswoman for the college said.
        He joined the faculty of Bryn Mawr in 1939, became a full professor in 1954 and was chairman of the mathematics department from 1948 to 1976. From 1975 until he retired in 1979, he was Class of 1897 Professor of Mathematics.
        Professor Oxtoby wrote "Measure and Category," which was published in 1971 and has been widely translated for use by scholars and graduate students. In 1978 he received the Lindback Award for Distinguished Teaching from the Lindback Foundation, a national educational group.
        He was born in Saginaw, Mich., graduated from the University of California at Berkeley and received a master's degree from Harvard University.
        Professor Oxtoby is survived by his wife, the former Jean Shaffer; two sons, Thomas of Detroit and David of Chicago; a daughter, Margaret of Atlanta; a sister, Florence Morris of Reno, Nev., and five grandchildren.
