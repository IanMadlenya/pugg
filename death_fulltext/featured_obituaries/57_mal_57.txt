        Gerald W. (Jerry) Schlossberg, who produced or co-produced 14 plays on and Off Broadway, died Thursday at Englewood (N.J.) Hospital. He was 55 years old and lived in Englewood.
        He died of cancer, his family said.

        Mr. Schlossberg was born in the Bronx and was a graduate of New York University. His wife, Barbara, died this year in an automobile accident.
        He is survived by his mother, Sonia, of Miami; a sister, Beverly Schweitzer of Englewood Cliffs, N.J.; a daughter, Jane Ellen Gales of Mendon, Vt., and four sons, Peter, of Newtonville, Mass.; Andrew, of Brooklyn; Todd, of Burlington, Vt., and David, of Englewood.
