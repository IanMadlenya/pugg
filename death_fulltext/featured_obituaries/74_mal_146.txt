        Alvin M. Binder, a lawyer who fought Ku Klux Klan attacks on Jews in Mississippi and defended the man convicted of the serial murders of children in Atlanta, died yesterday at a hospital in Jackson, Miss., where he lived. He was 63.
        The cause was cardiac arrest and complications of diabetes, his family said.
        When the Klan bombed synagogues and the homes of Jews in Mississippi in the late 1960's, Mr. Binder helped lead the opposition. He helped organize public opinion against the Klan, raised money and worked secretly with the Federal Bureau of Investigation to help pay informants against the Klan.
        The efforts, described in a new book by Jack Nelson, "Terror in the Night" (Simon & Schuster), culminated in law-enforcement officers' ambushing two Klan terrorists, thwarting a mission to kill a Jewish businessman. One Klan member, Thomas R. Tarrants, was arrested and another, Kathryn Ainsworth, was killed.
        Mr. Binder's career built on his skills in criminal defense. He handled cases in 20 states. He represented Wayne Williams, who was convicted in 1982 in the child-murders case in Atlanta.
        He was also the lawyer for Travis Ward, a businessman charged with trying to bribe Texas public service commissioners, in 1989 and 1990 trials that ended in hung juries.
        A native of Clarksdale, Miss., Mr. Binder graduated from Tulane University and received his law degree from the University of Mississippi. He served in the judge advocate corps in the Air Force from 1954 to 1956.
        He is survived by his wife of 16 years, Nancy Geno; four sons, Mitchel Binder of Los Angeles, Michael Binder of San Francisco, and Geno Lucas and Adam Binder, both of Jackson; two daughters, Lisa Milner of Jackson and Lowri Lucas of Memphis; a sister, Judy Feldman of Jackson, and four grandchildren.
