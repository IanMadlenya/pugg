        Marie-Michel Gouraud, who as a lieutenant general in the French Army played an important role in the 1961 Algerian mutiny that nearly toppled President Charles de Gaulle, died on Wednesday, the army said today.
        He was 86 years old. The cause of death was not announced.
        General Gouraud was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment for his role in the so-called Generals' Revolt, aimed at preserving French colonial rule in Algeria at a time when de Gaulle was seeking ways to negotiate with a nationalist Muslim insurgency.
        General Gouraud was not involved in plotting the revolt, but wavered in following orders to suppress it. He finally joined the short-lived coup before it collapsed. Prosecutors said at his trial that he was an opportunist who let himself be maneuvered by subordinates.
        The revolt collapsed after four days when de Gaulle showed that he had national support and conscripts in Algeria did not join the four mutinous generals -- Maurice Challe, Andre Zeller, Raoul Salan and Edmond Jouhaud.
        General Gouraud was released in 1965 and given a full pardon in 1982.
