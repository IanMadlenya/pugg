        Correction:  January 18, 1990, Thursday, Late Edition - Final
        An obituary on Friday about Dudley Field Malone, a theatrical agent and manager, misidentified a position held by his father, who bore the same name. He was Assistant Secretary of State under President Woodrow Wilson, not Assistant Secretary of the Navy under Franklin D. Roosevelt.
