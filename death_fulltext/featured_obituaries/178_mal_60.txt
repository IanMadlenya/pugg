        Byron Sanders, an actor in television soaps and the model for Salvador Dali's ''Crucifixion,'' died on Nov. 12 at a hospital in Manhattan. He was 76 and lived in Manhattan.
        He was born Reginald Byron Sanders in Charlotte, N.C., and served in Europe during World War II. After the war, he was the program director at the WOFA Blue Danube radio network and studied opera singing under Fritz Krenn.
        Mr. Sanders moved to New York in 1950 and acted in ''The Desk Set'' on Broadway, with Shirley Booth, and in ''Friday Night'' off Broadway, with Jan Sterling.
        In 1954 Dali chose Mr. Sanders to model for ''The Crucifixion,'' a large oil painting now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He sat for Dali about 12 hours and earned $25 an hour, he told The New York Times in an interview in 1992.
        Mr. Sanders later acted in the cult horror film ''The Flesh Eaters'' and in a series of television soap operas, including ''The Doctors,'' ''Love of Life'' and ''One Life to Live,'' on which he played the character Talbot Huddleston from 1977 to '79. He also became a leading tennis instructor at the Midtown Tennis Club on Eighth Avenue.
        He is survived by Ren√©e Fisherman, his companion of 21 years, and a niece, Betsy Sanders Canari of Knoxville, Tenn.
