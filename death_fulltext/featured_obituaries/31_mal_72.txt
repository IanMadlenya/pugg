        Nathan Levine, who worked with Gene Autry and John Wayne and headed Republic Pictures in a career spanning the silent and sound eras of movies, died Sunday at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital. He was 89 years old.
        Mr. Levine entered the film business at the age of 20 as an independent distributor who specialized in films rejected by the major studios. Seven years later he opened his own production company, Mascot Pictures, working out of an old studio in North Hollywood once owned by Mack Sennett.
        At Mascot he turned out 500 reels of serials, including three starring Mr. Wayne. Under contract to the studio were Mr. Autry and another cowboy star, Smiley Burnette.
        At that time he came to the attention of Herbert J. Yates, who owned Republic Film Laboratories and processed film for Mascot. Mr. Yates formed Republic Pictures in 1935 and Mr. Levine merged Mascot Pictures into the organization.
        Mr. Levine eventually became head of the company, bringing to it his expertise in low-budget, commercially successful features and long-running adventure serials.
        CBS bought the studio's headquarters in 1952 and renamed it Television City.
