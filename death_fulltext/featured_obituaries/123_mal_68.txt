        Arthur Luce Klein, the founder and president of Spoken Arts, a pioneering company in the field of recorded literature, died on April 7 at his home in New Rochelle, N.Y. He was 81.
        Mr. Klein founded Spoken Arts with his wife, Luce, in the mid-1950's to record important works of literature, poetry and drama. Since then the company has released more than 700 recordings of works by Yeats, Arthur Miller, Allen Ginsberg and numerous others, many of which are used in schools and libraries around the United States and abroad. Many of the recordings, like the 18-volume ''Treasury of 100 Modern American Poets,'' are of authors reading from their own works.
        Mr. Klein was born in Carbondale, Pa. He received a doctorate in theater arts from the University of Michigan and studied at the Sorbonne in Paris. After serving in the Army during World War II, he taught drama at the University of California at Berkeley, and in 1950 became the first American to direct plays at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London. He also directed and acted in plays throughout Europe, and, as the recipient of a grant from the State Department, lectured and gave readings at universities in France, Belgium and the Netherlands.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by three daughters, Judith E.,  of Manhattan; Florence, of Santa Barbara, Calif., and Rosine, of New Rochelle; a son, Joel, of Baltimore; a sister, Sylvia Meil of Scranton, Pa., and seven grandchildren.
