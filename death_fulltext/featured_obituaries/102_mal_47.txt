        Samuel H. Woolley, an executive who helped turn the Bank of New York Corporation into one of the nation's largest financial institutions, died on Sunday at his home in Morris Plains, N.J. He was 86.
        As the chairman and chief executive of the Bank of New York, Mr. Woolley engineered a series of deals that transformed it from a New York City bank into a statewide bank holding company.
        Mr. Woolley reached a pinnacle in his career when, in 1969, he merged the Bank of New York with the County Trust Company, in what was at the time the largest bank merger in history. Mr. Woolley then won approval from the Federal Reserve Board to combine the Bank of New York, County Trust and five other banks into one holding company under the Bank of New York umbrella.
        "The successful Bank of New York today is in great part a result of Sam's leadership and vision," said J. Carter Bacot, the current chairman and chief executive of the company.
        Mr. Woolley retired as chairman in 1974 after 41 years at the bank, though he remained a director until last May.
        He also served on a number of corporate boards, including those of Colgate-Palmolive, Amstar, Babcock & Wilcox and Texas Oil and Gas. He was an emeritus trustee of Bucknell University, his alma mater, and the New York Public Library.
        Mr. Woolley is survived by his wife, Elisabeth, of Morris Plains; a sister, Louise Janowitz of Gloucester, N.J.; a son, Harold, of New York City; four grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
