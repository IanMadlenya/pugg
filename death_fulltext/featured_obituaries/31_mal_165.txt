        Nathan K. Kolodner, former president of the Gay Men's Health Crisis, died of AIDS-related causes Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 38 years old.
        Mr. Kolodner, a native of Baltimore, joined the Gay Men's Health Crisis in 1983 as a volunteer, two years after the private AIDS-services agency was founded. He used his experience as an art dealer and director of the Andre Emmerich Gallery in Manhattan to organize an art auction at Sotheby's, the first event to raise $1 million to help sufferers of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
        Mr. Kolodner was elected president of the organization's board of directors in 1986 and served until 1988, after which he remained a board member. As president, he oversaw the growth of the agency into the largest private AIDS group in New York City. Among its services are psychological and group counseling, advice on legal and insurance matters and medical referrals. Mr Kolodner presided over the agency's purchase and renovation of its six-story headquarters at 129 West 20th Street.
        He is survived by his mother, Ferne Kandel Kolodner; two brothers, F. Kirk and Kenneth Brad Kolodner, and a grandmother, Rose A. Kandel, all of Baltimore. His longtime companion was Rene Amrein.
