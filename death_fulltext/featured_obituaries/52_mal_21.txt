        Juozas Urbsys, the last Foreign Minister of independent Lithuania, died early today in Kaunas, Lithuania, after a long illness, officials reported. He was 95 years old.
        The cause of death was not given.
        Mr. Urbsys served as Foreign Minister from December 1938 to June 1940. After a secret pact between Moscow and Nazi Germany in 1939 took Lithuania into the Soviet sphere. Mr. Urbsys was summoned to Moscow and informed that his country would cease to exist.
        In June 1940, after the Soviets occupied Lithuania, Mr. Urbsys was arrested and deported to Siberia. He spent the next 13 years in prison, 11 of them in solitary confinement.
        In the 1950's, Mr. Urbsys returned to Lithuania, where for a quarter of a century he lived in obscurity, making his living by translating from French into Lithuanian.
        His name surfaced again in September 1988, with the publication of his memoirs, "Lithuania During the Fatal Years, 1939-40" -- one of the first books addressing the Lithuanian history that had been hidden under Soviet rule.
        Though his health prevented him from taking an active part in the revived political life of his country, Mr. Urbsys enjoyed great authority and respect among his countrymen. "He was the symbol of independent Lithuania," said Aurelius Katkevicius, a Lithuanian official.
        A Government commission has been set up to organize the funeral for Mr. Urbsys. His body will lay in state at the War Museum in Kaunas until funeral services next Saturday.
