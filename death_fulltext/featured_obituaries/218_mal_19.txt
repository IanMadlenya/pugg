        John Laub, a New York-based landscape painter, died on March 3 at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 57.
        The cause was leukemia, said his partner, Bruce C. Kingsley.
        Mr. Laub painted scenic views in places like Fire Island, Woodstock, Martha's Vineyard and Mount Desert Island, Me. He would begin painting at the site and finish in the studio, referring to drawings and photographs. The combinations of vivid color, emphatic brushwork and realistic observation that he produced call to mind paintings by contemporary realists like Neil Welliver and Janet Fish.
        John Frederick Laub was born in Philadelphia on Dec. 30, 1947. He studied at the Tyler School of Art in Philadelphia, the School of Visual Arts in New York and the Philadelphia College of Art, from which he received a degree in graphic design.
        Upon graduation, a teacher advised him to abandon design and become a painter. He had his first solo exhibition at the Philadelphia Art Alliance in 1975 and his first solo show in New York, where he moved in 1984, at the Helio Gallery in 1991. He had three exhibitions at Fischbach Gallery, now in Chelsea, the last in 2003.
        Mr. Laub, who learned he had H.I.V. in 1989, was a longtime AIDS activist. For five years he was a supervisor of the AIDS hot line of the Gay Men's Health Crisis.
        Mr. Laub is survived by Mr. Kingsley; his mother and stepfather, Lorraine and Ben Alexander, of Huntingdon Valley, Pa.; his father, Richard Laub,of West Palm Beach; his brother, Michael Laub, of Gladwyne, Pa.; and his sisters, Kathleen Laub, of Delray Beach, Fla., and Patricia Tieger, of Tivoli, N.Y.
