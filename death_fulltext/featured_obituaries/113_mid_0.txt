        Preble Stolz, a retired law professor at the University of California at Berkeley and the author of a book critical of Rose Elizabeth Bird when she was California's Chief Justice, died on Tuesday while sailing on San Francisco Bay.  He was 65 years old and lived in Berkeley, Calif.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his son, Christopher.
        Mr. Stolz, a native of Chicago, taught at Boalt Hall, the law school at Berkeley, from 1960 to 1992. From 1974 to 1976, he took a leave to direct the State Office of Planning and Research under Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr.
        Mr. Stolz's book, "Judging Judges" (Free Press, 1981), focused on a former colleague in the Brown administration, Ms. Bird, whom Mr. Brown had appointed Chief Justice in 1977. In 1978, Justice Bird barely survived an election to unseat her, and she and other justices were accused of improperly delaying the announcement of a potentially unpopular decision to help her at the polls.
        An inquiry by the California Commission on Judicial Performance reached no firm conclusion about possible wrongdoing. Mr. Stolz's book detailed the work of the panel, which lasted an extraordinary 11 months, and was highly critical of the Chief Justice. Reviewing the book for The New York Times Book Review, Alan M. Dershowitz found Mr. Stolz's account "valuable" and "disturbing." But an article in The Los Angeles Times Book Review said that Mr. Stolz had a "virulently anti-Bird bias." Justice Bird was soundly defeated in her bid to be  confirmed for a 12-year term in 1986.
        Besides his son, who lives in Ojai, Calif., Professor Stolz is survived by two daughters, Abigail Patella of Anchorage, and Margaret Huscher of Redding, Calif., and seven grandchildren.
