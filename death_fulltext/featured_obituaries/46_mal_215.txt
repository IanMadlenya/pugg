        Lord Pearce, chairman of a Government panel in 1972 that rejected a proposed settlement in Rhodesia on the ground that most blacks opposed it, died Monday, newspapers reported today. He was 89 years old.
        Lord Pearce, a former senior judge, died at his home in the village of Crowborough in the county of Sussex in southern England. No cause of death was given.
        On Nov. 11, 1965, the white minority Rhodesian government of Ian D. Smith declared itself free of all remaining colonial links with Britain. Britain, which was hoping to steer Rhodesia to full independence under eventual black rule, said the the independence declaration was illegal. It said that independence under continuing white rule, as sought by Mr. Smith, must be acceptable to the entire population.
        Lord Pearce's panel visited Rhodesia to determine whether proposals for a constitutional settlement with Mr. Smith's administration for continuing white rule were acceptable on this basis. The commission ruled that the proposals were unacceptable to most Africans there. Subsequent negotiations between Britain and Mr. Smith's administration failed.
        The issue was resolved by a conference in London in 1979. Elections were held in February 1980, and the country gained independence from Britain on April 18, 1980, as the black-ruled Republic of Zimbabwe.
        Edward Holroyd Pearce, born on Feb. 9, 1901, was educated at Charterhouse and Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He became a High Court judge in 1948, the year he was knighted. He was a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, or Law Lord, from 1962 to 1967. The Law Lords constitute the highest court in the land.
        Lord Pearce's wife, Erica, and the couple's two sons have died.
