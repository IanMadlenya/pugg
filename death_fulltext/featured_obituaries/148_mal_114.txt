        Robert Fred Mozley, professor emeritus of physics at Stanford University and an expert on nuclear arms control, died on Monday at Stanford Hospital. He was 82 and lived in Menlo Park, Calif., and Southport Island, Me.
        The cause was complications from surgery, the university said.
        Dr. Mozley worked at the Stanford Linear Accelerator, where he did research in high-energy physics on a particle-tracking device he pioneered. The device, a streamer chamber, allows physicists to study subatomic events.
        Dr. Mozley, who was born in Boston and graduated from Harvard University in 1938, worked on radar technology at the Sperry Gyroscope Company in World War II. He received a doctorate at the University of California at Berkeley in 1950 and took part in the construction of the world's first proton linear accelerator.
        After teaching and doing research at Princeton University, he joined the Stanford faculty in 1953, became a full professor in 1962 and retired in 1987. As a member of the Faculty Senate, he was among the first to sound the alarm over increasing academic reliance on Pentagon grants and official efforts to designate unclassified research as secret.
        In retirement he worked on arms-control issues and nuclear non-proliferation as a staff physicist for the Federation of American Scientists and contributed to several publications and a book, ''Reversing the Arms Race.''
        He wrote two books, ''Uranium Enrichment and Other Technical Problems Relating to Nuclear Weapons Proliferation'' (Center for International Security and Arms Control, at Stanford, 1994) and ''Politics and Technology of Nuclear Proliferation'' (University of Washington, 1998).
        Dr. Mozley is survived by his wife, Anita Ventura Mozley; his son, Peter, of Socorro, N.M.; a sister, Dorothy Mozley of Orange City, Calif.; and two grandchildren.
