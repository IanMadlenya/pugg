        Genichiro Inokuma, a Japanese painter who lived in New York from 1955 to 1975, died last Monday at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo, the Kyodo News Service reported. He was 90.
        Mr. Inokuma became known in the United States for abstract paintings he did while living in New York. Earlier in his career, he made a name in Japan for figurative works.
        Mr. Inokuma was born in the port of Tagamatsu, studied art at what is now the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music and achieved recognition in his country at an early age. From 1938 to 1940, he lived in France, where he was counseled by Matisse and got to know Picasso.
        He moved back to Japan from New York after suffering a stroke. In later years, he divided his time between Japan and Hawaii. A museum of his art opened in 1991 in Marugame, not far from his birthplace.
