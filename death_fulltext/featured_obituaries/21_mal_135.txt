Born in Joliet, Ill., he received a bachelor of philosophy degree from the University of Chicago and taught economics and accounting before becoming Mr. Rosenwald's financial assistant in 1929.
        From 1929 to 1948 Mr. Levin was controller of the Rosenwald Fund. He was president of The Reporter magazine from its founding in 1948 until it closed in 1968 and was chairman of Pantheon Books during the same period. For four decades beginning in 1946 he was a director of Scientific American.
        Mr. Levin was associated with the New School for Social Research for many years, serving as board chairman from 1960 to 1963 and acting president during part of that period. He was also on the boards of the Museum of Modern Art and the Hall of Science in New York and the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago.
        Mr. Levin is survived by his wife, Pam; a son, Robert, of Croton Falls, N.Y.; two daughters, Joan Kirsch of Clarksburg, Md., and Nina Jalladeau of Paris; eight grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
