        Alexander I. Ross, a former advertising executive and national leader in Jewish organizations, died on Tuesday in Rye, N.Y. He was 80 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was cardiovascular disease, said his daughter, Catherine.
        For three decades, Mr. Ross worked for the advertising firm of Al Paul Lefton, where he oversaw the account of the Beneficial Finance Company. Its jingle, ''At Beneficial, You're Good for More,'' was widely played on radio and television in the 1960's.
        Mr. Ross was born in Danzig, now the Polish city of Gdansk, and fled with his family to the United States in 1940. He graduated from the Columbia University School of Journalism.
        From 1977 to 1983, Mr. Ross was national chairman of the Social Action Commission of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, helping create a Washington center that evaluates contemporary social issues. He also directed public relations for the American Committee for the Weizmann Institute of Science.
        In addition to his daughter, a professor at George Washington University Law School, his survivors include a brother, Henry Rosovsky, and a grandson.
