        Rabbi Mordecai Savitsky, an authority on the Talmud and Jewish law, died on June 8 at the Good Samaritan Hospital in Suffern, N.Y. He was 80 years old and lived in Monsey, N.Y.
        He died of congestive heart failure, said his brother-in-law, Rabbi Bernard Poupko.
        Rabbi Savitsky, a native of Poland, wrote 22 books on the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds. His first volume, "Bikurei Mordecai," was published in 1930, when he was 19 years old.
        From 1939 to 1984, he was affiliated with Chevra Shaas in Boston. He was honorary president of the Union of Orthodox Rabbis of the United States.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Basia Poupko; three sons, all rabbis, Joseph, of Jerusalem, Yasacov Moshe of Brooklyn, and Henach, of Kew Gardens, Queens; three daughters, Leah Irons of Detroit and Shana Zellinger and Ruth Stepansky of Brooklyn, and 35 grandchildren.
