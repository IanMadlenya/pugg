        Dr. Robert Henry Strotz, an expert in economic theory and econometrics who served as president of Northwestern University from 1970 to 1985, died on Wednesday in a nursing home in Deerfield, Ill. A resident of Wilmette, Ill., he was 72.
        He had suffered a long illness, the university reported.
        During Dr. Strotz's tenure, Northwestern experienced continued faculty and student growth and made capital improvements of more than $142 million, the university said.
        After his retirement as president, Dr. Strotz became university chancellor and remained in that post until 1990. As chancellor he acted primarily as a fund-raiser and liaison to alumni.
        Born in Aurora, Ill., he graduated from the University of Chicago, where he earned his doctorate in 1951 with a thesis on welfare economics. He studied econometrics at research centers in England, the Netherlands and Sweden.
        In World War II he put his studies on hold while he served with the Army in Europe.
        He joined the faculty of Northwestern in Evanston, Ill., in 1947 and became a professor in the department of economics by 1958. From 1966 until 1970 he served as dean of the College of Arts and Sciences.
        Before becoming president, he was the author or co-author of books and many articles on business investment and many other subjects. He was a former editor of Econometrica, the quarterly of the Econometric Society, associate editor of the International Economic Review and editor of Contributions to Economic Analysis.
        He is survived by his wife, Margaret Hanley Strotz; four daughters, Vicki Rhodes of Madison, Wis., Frances Strotz of Waukegan, Ill., Ellen Macieiski of Danville, Ill., and Ann Pence of Kasilaf, Alaska; a son, Michael of Winnetka, Ill.; a brother, Loren of Aurora; three stepdaughters, Katie Hanley and Elizabeth Hughes of Evanston and Marcia Hoover of Seattle, and 13 grandchildren.
