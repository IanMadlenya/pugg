        John Paul Walsh, an engineer who was the scientist at Cape Canaveral in charge of the launching of the second American satellite to go into orbit, died  last Friday at Indian River Community Hospital in Vero Beach, Fla. He was 78 and lived in Vero Beach.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        The Vanguard Satellite Program on which he worked was begun by the Naval Research Laboratory. As Vanguard's Deputy Director, Mr. Walsh was in charge of the launching site in December 1957, when the Navy first tried to loft its answer to the Sputnik satellite that the Soviet Union had put in orbit two months earlier.
        That first effort ended in failure, as the rocket sputtered shortly after lift-off and settled back in a mass of flames and smoke. After the United States succeeded in launching the Explorer 1 on Jan. 31, 1958, another try with the Vanguard 1 in March 1958 was smooth, and the satellite went in orbit, where it remains as the oldest man-made object circling Earth.
        Later that year, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration took over  the Vanguard program and its staff from the Navy. Mr. Walsh left that December for private employment after 16 years with the naval laboratory.
        Born in Fall River, Mass., he was a mechanical engineering graduate of Stevens Institute of Technology and earned an M.S. degree at the University of Maryland. Working for the Navy in World War II, he specialized in the field of shock and vibration. He studied the strain put on a warship in firing all guns at once and measured pressure generated by atomic bombs detonated above the Pacific after the war.
        Mr. Walsh is survived by his wife of 53 years, Joan Edwards Walsh; two sons,  James P. Jr., of Boulder, Colo., and William J., of Rye, N.Y; a daughter, Joanne Carroll of Sherwood Forest, Md.; two sisters, Cecilia Parker of Apponaug, R.I.,  and Kathleen Whelan of Quonochontaug, R.I., and eight grandchildren.
