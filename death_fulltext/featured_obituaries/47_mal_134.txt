        Clarence A. Monroe, the chief engineer for Levitt & Sons, builders of the huge Levittown communities after World War II, died on Thursday at his home in Haddonfield, N.J. He was 90 years old.
        He died of bone cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Monroe, an orphan who was raised in a foster home in Jamaica, Queens, earned licenses as a surveyor and a professional engineer through correspondence courses. In the 1920's he worked for Carl Fisher, the developer, in Montauk, L.I.
        When he opened his own engineering firm in Manhasset, L.I., Levitt was one of his first clients. Eventually he went to work full time for Levitt, planning the layout, utilities, public areas and support systems for Levittown, L.I., Levittown, Pa., and Willingboro, N.J., as well as smaller Levitt developments in Bel Aire, Md., Puerto Rico and Paris. He retired in 1969 after 40 years with the concern.
        Mr. Monroe is survived by his wife, the former Lavinda Dedrick; three daughters, Barbara Felton of San Francisco; Marilyn Laferty of Santa Rosa, Calif., and Lynne Monroe of Kensington, N.H.; two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
