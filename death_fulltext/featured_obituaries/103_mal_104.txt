        Leslie Berger, a clinical psychologist and educator who developed a statewide remedial education program and taught a course on the effects of the Holocaust on the descendants of its survivors, died on Aug. 9 at White Plains Hospital. He was 67 and lived in White Plains.
        The cause was cancer, his family reported this week.
        At his death, Dr. Berger was teaching in the counselor education program of Queens College. He also maintained a private psychotherapy practice for the last 35 years in Manhattan and White Plains.
        Early in his teaching career, he was on the faculties of Brooklyn College and City College. In 1965, he became director of a City College program that sought to broaden educational opportunities for students who lacked them.
        In 1967, he was named associate university dean at the City University of New York, responsible for developing and overseeing a statewide remedial education program for eight senior colleges. The program, SEEK, is for low-income students without adequate high school preparation but with college potential.
        In the 1970's and early 80's, he held administrative positions at CUNY.  Dr. Berger returned to teaching at Queens College in 1984. In the 1980's and early 90's he taught the course "A Psychological Understanding of the Holocaust," in which he addressed the concerns of the children and other descendants of survivors. He also wrote for scholarly journals and contributed to books on the subject.
        He graduated in psychology from Brooklyn College in 1954 and received a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from the University of Michigan in 1957.
        He is survived by his wife, Pauline, and two daughters, Nicole B. Futterman and Dr. Noelle Berger, all of White Plains, and a brother, Steven of Aventura, Fla.
