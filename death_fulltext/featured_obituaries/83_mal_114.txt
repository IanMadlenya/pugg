        Dr. Alan O. Ross, a retired psychology professor at the State University of New York at Stony Brook who conducted research on child psychology, behavioral therapy and personality, died on Tuesday at his home in East Setauket, L.I. He was 72.
        The cause was a brain tumor, said his brother, Warren R. Ross.
        Dr. Ross helped establish clinical psychology for children as a subspecialty in the field and wrote a number of books, including a standard textbook, "The Practice of Clinical Child Psychology" (1959). Among his other books were "The Exceptional Child in the Family (1964), "Psychological Disorders of Children" (1974), "Learning Disability" (1977), "Child Behavior Therapy (1981), "Personality" (1987) and "The Sense of Self" (1992).
        He was born in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, in 1921, and came to the United States in 1940. He earned a bachelor's degree at City College and a Ph.D. in clinical psychology at Yale University.
        Dr. Ross was chief clinical psychologist at the Clifford W. Beers Guidance Clinic in New Haven, Conn., from 1956 to 1959 and chief psychologist at the Pittsburgh Child Guidance Center in Pennsylvania from 1959 to 1967, when he was named professor of psychology at Stony Brook. He was director of the clinical training program and director of undergraduate studies in the psychology department. He retired in 1991.
        Dr. Ross was a member of the New York State Board of Psychology from 1980 to 1990 and president of the Association for the Advancement of Behavior Therapy in 1983. He wrote many articles for psychology journals. In 1982 he was given an award for distinguished professional contributions to clinical psychology by the American Psychological Association.
        Besides his brother, he is survived by his wife, Ilse; two daughters, Judith Leibowitz of Avon, Conn., and Pamela Ross of East Setauket, and two grandchildren.
