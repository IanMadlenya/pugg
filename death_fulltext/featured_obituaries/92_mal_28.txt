        Frederick Manfred, the author of many novels set in a mythical High Plains territory he called Siouxland, died on Wednesday in Luverne, Minn. He was 82 and lived in Luverne.
        The cause was lymphoma, said his agent, Albert Eisele.
        Mr. Manfred was born on a farm near Doon, Iowa, and earned a bachelor's degree and a teacher's certificate from Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Mich. He worked as a reporter for The Minneapolis Journal from 1937 to 1939 and as the editor of Modern Medicine from 1942 to 1943.
        His first novel, "The Golden Bowl" (1944), based on his experiences hitchhiking through the Dust Bowl and the Badlands of South Dakota, received positive reviews and earned Mr. Manfred a grant from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. The manuscript for his third novel, "This Is the Year" (1947), found its way to Sinclair Lewis, who steered the younger writer to Doubleday, which published "The Primitive" (1949), "The Brother" (1950) and "The Giant" (1951). In 1952, Mr. Manfred legally changed his name from Feike Feikema.
        In 1954, Mr. Manfred published "Lord Grizzly," the first of "The Buckskin Man Tales," an epic series that dealt with the ranchers, Indians and gold miners of the High Plains. The other novels in the series are "Riders of Judgment" (1957), "Conquering Horse" (1959), "Scarlet Plume" (1964) and "King of Spades" (1966).
        At the time of his death, he had completed the manuscript of an autobiographical novel, "The Wrath of Love."
        He is survived by two daughters, Freya, of Shorewood, Minn., and Marya, of Luverne; a son, Frederick, of Luverne; three brothers, Abben Feikema of Garden Grove, Calif., Floyd Feikema of Minneapolis, and Henry Feikema, also of Minneapolis, and two grandchildren.
