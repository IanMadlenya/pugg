        John A. Stichnoth, a former vice president and general counsel of the Union Carbide Corporation who helped devise the company's legal strategy following the world's worst industrial disaster in Bhopal, India, died on Wednesday at Danbury Hospital, near his summer home in Ridgefield, Conn. He was 74 and also lived in North Palm Beach, Fla.
        The cause was complications from respiratory problems, his son Matthew said.
        Mr. Stichnoth was chief counsel for the chemical manufacturing giant in December 1984, when deadly clouds of gas escaped from a chemical plant in the impoverished town of Bhopal, killing about 4,000 people overnight and critically injuring thousands more. Mr. Stichnoth successfully sought to have all claims filed against the company in the United States moved to courts in India. Mr. Stichnoth retired in 1987. In 1989, Union Carbide agreed to pay the Indian Government $470 million in compensation.
        Mr. Stichnoth was reared in Sioux City, Iowa, and served in the Army's War Crimes Department in Munich in 1946 and 1947. When he returned to the United States, he enrolled at the University of Iowa, where he received a bachelor's degree and a law degree by 1951.
        That year he joined the New York law firm of Wilkie Farr & Gallagher and in 1955 joined Union Carbide's legal department. He was named general counsel in 1976.
        Mr. Stichnoth was chairman of the Committee on Corporate Law Departments of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, and he was an officer of the Association of General Counsel.
        In addition to his wife, Patricia, he is survived by a sister, Helen Lidstone of Pittsfield, Mass.; two daughters, Susan Brackett of Manhattan and Julie Truelove of Duxbury, Mass.; two sons, John Jr., of Ridgewood, N.J., and Matthew, of Morganville, N.J., and 10 grandchildren.
