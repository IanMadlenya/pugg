        Fred Decré, former co-owner of the Manhattan restaurant La Caravelle, died on Feb. 20 in Palm Beach, Fla., where he lived. He was 82.
        He had a heart ailment, his colleague Roger Fessaguet said.
        He was born in Illinois and grew up in France and Italy. He returned to the United States in 1936. In 1941, he was hired at Le Pavillon in Manhattan and, after serving in the United States Army in World War II, eventually became assistant principal maître d'hôtel.
        In 1960, he left Le Pavillon and opened La Caravelle, on West 55th Street, with Robert Meyzen as co-owner. Mr. Decré was also co-owner of La Crémaillière in Banksville, N.Y., and Le Poulailler, near Lincoln Center. His restaurant holdings were sold in the late 1970's and early 1980's. He retired in 1980.
        He is survived by his wife, Rita; a daughter, Janice Boretti of White Hall, Md.; and three grandchildren.
        Correction:  March 5, 2002, Tuesday  An obituary on Saturday about Fred Decré, a restaurateur, misspelled the name of a restaurant in Banksville, N.Y., of which he was a co-owner. It is La Crémaillère, not Crémaillière.
