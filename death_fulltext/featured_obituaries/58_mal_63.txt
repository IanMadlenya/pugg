        Lance Hayward, a jazz pianist, died on Saturday at Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 75 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of pneumonia, said Claudia Marx, a friend.
        Mr. Hayward was born in Bermuda, where he lived until he moved to New York City at the age of 50. Blind since infancy, he received formal training in classical piano and was a self-taught jazz musician, eventually becoming one of Bermuda's best-known jazz artists. He was often the accompanist of choice for Carmen McRae, Marvin Gaye and others when they performed on the island.
        In New York he appeared at many jazz clubs, including West Boondock, Jacques-in-the-Village and most recently the Village Corner, where he appeared regularly for 16 years. He formed his own chorus, the Lance Hayward Singers, which performed a wide variety of music, from Bach to Ellington.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary, and a son, Stuart, both of Bermuda, and a daughter, Sylvia, of Manhattan. A memorial service is to be held tomorrow at 8 P.M. at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street.
