        Maurice G. Hardy, chairman of the Pall Corporation, a manufacturer of industrial and medical filters, died Sunday at his home in Old Brookville, L.I. He was 64.
        The cause was cancer, the corporation said in an announcement.
        The company, which has headquarters in East Hills, L.I., makes filters for a number of uses. Its major markets are health care, paint, petrochemicals, magnetic tape and electric power.
        The company was founded in 1946.  Mr. Hardy, who was born and reared in England, became its president in 1962, later moving it to New York from London. He became chairman two years ago.
        Mr. Hardy was a director of the American Business Conference in Washington and the National Center for Disability Services in Albertson, L.I.
        He is survived by his wife, Joyce, of Old Brookville.
