        Harris B. Hull, a retired Air Force brigadier general who was a special assistant in five NASA administrations, died Friday at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington. He was 83 and lived in Bethesda, Md.
        His son Robert Archer Hull said the cause of death was a heart attack.
        General Hull was assigned to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in 1963. After retiring from the Air Force in 1964, he remained with NASA until retiring in 1986. For most of his years at the agency, he had the title of special assistant to the Administrator and concentrated on public affairs.
        His active-duty career in the Air Force, and earlier in the Army Air Forces, was mostly as a staff officer. But for a time in World War II, after the Allied invasion at Normandy, he commanded the Air Crew Recovery Unit. It worked with members of the French Resistance, Swiss officials and others to arrange the return of American airmen who had been shot down, or had been prisoners of war and had escaped.
        General Hull was born in Williamsburg, Iowa. He earned a degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1930 and was commissioned as a reserve officer. After working as a reporter for The Washington Post and in the airline industry, he was called to active duty in 1942 and remained in uniform for 22 years.
        His marriage to the former Bernice Stephens ended in divorce. His second wife, the former Jeanne Lejeune Glennon, died last year.
        In addition to his son Robert, of Dallas, General Hull is survived by two daughters, Joan Stephens Hull of San Francisco and Louise Smoak of Bethesda; another son, Harris Hull Jr. of Arlington, Va.; two stepdaughters, Katherine Meares of Versailles, Ky., and Ellie Harris of Edina, Minn., and nine grandchildren.
