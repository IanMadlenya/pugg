        Maurice Natanson, a philosopher who helped introduce the work of Jean-Paul Sartre and Edmund Husserl in the United States, died on Friday at his home in Santa Cruz, Calif. He was 71.
        The cause was prostate cancer, said Judith Butler, a friend.
        Mr. Natanson was born in Manhattan and raised in Brooklyn. He earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy from Lincoln Memorial University in Harrogate, Tenn., in 1945, a master's degree in philosophy from New York University in 1948, a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Nebraska in 1950 and a doctorate in social science from the New School of Social Research in Manhattan in 1953.
        After teaching at the University of Houston, the University of North Carolina and the University of California at Santa Cruz, he joined the department of philosophy at Yale University in 1976, where he taught until his retirement last year.
        His many books include ''Literature, Philosophy and the Social Sciences'' (1962), ''Phenomenology, Role and Reason'' (1974) and ''Anonymity: A Study in the Philosophy of Alfred Schutz'' (1986). His book ''Edmund Husserl'' won a National Book Award in 1974. His last book, ''The Erotic Bird: Phenomenology in Literature,'' is to be published by Princeton University Press.
        He is survived by his wife, Lois Lichenstein Natanson; a brother, Harvey, of Brooklyn, and two sons, Charles, of Santa Cruz, and Nicholas, of Tacoma Park, Md.
