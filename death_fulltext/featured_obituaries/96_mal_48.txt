        Keith McDaniel, a principal dancer with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and on Broadway, died on Jan. 2 at his home in Los Angeles. He was 38.
        The cause was AIDS, said his companion, Matt Tapscott.
        Mr. McDaniel, who performed with the Ailey troupe from 1975 to 1983, stood out onstage for the quiet radiance he brought to all his roles, from wide-eyed youngsters in Donald McKayle's "District Storyville" and Talley Beatty's "Stack-Up" to the sensual lover in Elisa Monte's "Treading" and an ecstatic baptismal celebrant in Ailey's "Revelations."
        Mr. McDaniel was a strong jazz dancer and a performer with a natural-seeming sense of dramatic nuance. As a lead dancer and dance captain in the Broadway musical "Kiss of the Spider Woman," he partnered Chita Rivera like a chivalrous, prowling cat.
        Mr. McDaniel was born in Chicago, where he trained in modern and jazz dance. He was reluctant at first to accept an invitation from Ailey and his advisers to come to New York to study, but once in the company he quickly became a favorite of the choreographer and the audience. After he left the Ailey company, he performed on Broadway in "Leader of the Pack," then went to Los Angeles to work in film, television and music videos.
        His film credits include "Great Balls of Fire," "The Lady Killers" and "Basic Instinct." He appeared on the Tracey Ullman show and in "Moonlighting" on television and danced in several Academy Award shows.
        In addition to Mr. Tapscott, he is survived by his father, Vernon, of Chicago, and a brother, Kevin, of Kansas City, Kan.
        There will be a memorial service in Chicago on Saturday at 11 A.M. at the Greater Bethesda Baptist Church; in Manhattan on Jan. 23 at 7:30 P.M. at the Ailey headquarters, 211 West 61st Street, and in Los Angeles on Jan. 28 at 3 P.M. at the Performing Arts Center in Van Nuys.
