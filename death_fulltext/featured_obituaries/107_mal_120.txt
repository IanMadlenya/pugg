        William H. D. Cotrell Jr., who helped create Disneyland, died here on Friday  at the St. Joseph Hospital Medical Center. He was 89.
        Mr. Cotrell was a close adviser to Walt Disney. He headed the division of the Disney company that designed and built Disneyland, which opened in Anaheim, Calif., in 1955.
        Mr. Cotrell began his career with Disney as a cameraman. He later worked as  an animation director and writer on such films as "Pinocchio," "Alice in Wonderland" and "Peter Pan."
        He retired in 1982 after spending 18 years running Retlaw Enterprises, the company that conducted business for the Disney family.

        An obituary by The Associated Press on Tuesday about a former Disney executive misspelled his surname. He was William H. D. Cottrell Jr., not Cotrell.
