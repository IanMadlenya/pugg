        Paul Lepercq, a businessman who served as chairman of the board of the Brooklyn Academy of Music from 1971 to 1976, died on Saturday at the Hopital St. Louis in Paris. He was 77 and had homes in Paris and Bermuda.
        The cause was lymphatic cancer, said his company, Lepercq, de Neuflize & Co.
        Mr. Lepercq was born in France and moved to the United States in 1948 to attend Harvard Business School. He then joined Andre Istel & Co., a New York financial firm that became Lepercq, de Neuflize & Co. Mr. Lepercq served on the boards of Schlumberger Limited, Gaumont S.A. and Pathe, among others.
        While living in New York, Mr. Lepercq became an ardent supporter of the Brooklyn Academy of Music. A performance area at the academy was named the Lepercq Space in his honor in 1973.
        He is survived by his wife, Francoise Stoll-Lepercq, and a daughter, Edmee.
