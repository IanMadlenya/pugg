        George Dangerfield, the British-born American historian, died of leukemia on Dec. 27 at Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara, Calif. He was 82 years old.
        Mr. Dangerfield, a fellow of the Society of American Historians, was the author of a number of books, including ''The Strange Death of Liberal England'' (1935), 'Victoria's Heir: The Education of a Prince'' (1941), ''The Era of Good Feelings'' (1952), ''The Awakening of American Nationalism, 1815-1828'' (1965), ''Defiance to the Old World'' (1970) and ''The Damnable Question'' (1976).
        He was born in Newbury, Berkshire, in 1904, came to the United States in 1930, and was naturalized in 1945. He was literary editor of Vanity Fair magazine from 1933 to 1935. During World War II, he served with the 102d Infantry Division in Europe.
        For the last 30 years, Mr. Dangerfield lived in Santa Barbara, where he taught from 1968 through 1972 at the University of California.
        ''The Era of Good Feelings,'' which won both the Bancroft Prize and the Pulitzer Prize in American history in 1953, was about some of the personalities and events in the political transition from Jeffersonian democracy to Jacksonian democracy. The American historian Richard Hofstadter praised the book as ''a general synthesis of the history of the period that is almost certain to endure as a standard work.''
        Mr. Dangerfield defined his own concept of historical writing as ''a combination of taste, imagination, science and scholarship; it reconciles incompatibles, it balances probabilities; and at last it attains the reality of fiction, which is the highest reality of all.''
        He is survived by his wife, Mary Lou; two daughters, Mary Jo Lewis and Hilary Fabre, both of Cambridge, Mass.; a son, Anthony, of Hanover, N.H., and a grandson.
