        Dr. Martin H. Stryker, an official of the New York Blood Center who helped make the clotting factors derived from blood plasma safe for hemophiliacs, died on Sunday in Long Island Jewish Hospital in New Hyde Park, L.I. He was 51 and lived in Jericho, L.I.
        The cause was complications from gall bladder surgery, said his wife, Margaret.
        Dr. Stryker, who worked for the blood center for more than 20 years, played an important role in developing a method using solvents and detergents to kill dangerous viruses in plasma and its derivatives. The method is used in 40 countries to protect hemophiliacs and others from blood-borne viruses like hepatitis B and H.I.V., which causes AIDS.
        At the time of his death, he was vice president for scientific affairs of the Melville Biologics Division of the New York Blood Center. The division was established in Melville, L.I., to manufacture plasma derivatives such as albumin and Factor 8, a blood-clotting factor.
        Dr. Stryker was born in the Bronx. He received his undergraduate degree from Columbia College and his master's degree and doctorate in biochemistry from New York Medical College.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, David and Andrew, of Jericho, and his mother, Ida Stryker of Glen Oaks, Queens.
