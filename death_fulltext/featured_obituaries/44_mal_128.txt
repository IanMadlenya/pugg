        Norman D. Denny, a banker and builder, died Friday at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. He was 69 years old and lived in Merion, Pa.
        He died of leukemia, said his daughter, Alexis.
        Mr. Denny had a varied career as a builder, banker and civic leader. He was the founder in 1964 of the Lincoln National Bank, the first national bank chartered in Philadelphia after the Depression. He used the bank to promote civic activity in Philadelphia and joined with the Philadelphia National Bank more than a decade ago to lend $4.3 million to help keep the Bond Baking Company solvent, thereby saving about 900 jobs.
        He also provided financing for the Playhouse in the Park, a summer theater in Fairmount Park, and sponsored the Lincoln Bank Summer Festivals that attracted leading entertainers to the city. Through the Denny Development Corporation, he took a leading role in helping rebuild the northern section of the city.
        Before moving to Philadelphia in 1952, Mr. Denny was a vice president of what was Levitt & Sons, the development company.
        He is survived by two sons, Mark of Hermosa Beach, Calif. and Fred of Long Beach, Calif.; two daughters, Alexis and Samantha, both of Philadelphia; a brother, Sidney Kirsch of Hollywood, Fla., and three grandchildren. Starrett Housingd(Levitt)
