        Annie Herron, an art dealer and curator in the East Village of Manhattan in the early 1980's who opened the first commercial gallery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, died in the Bronx on Friday. She was 50.
        The cause was leiomyosarcoma, a rare form of cancer, said a friend and collaborator, Larry Walczak.
        Frances Anne Herron was born in Atlanta and came to New York City in 1977. From 1983 to 1987 she worked at Semaphore East Gallery in the East Village, which presented solo shows by young artists like Ellen Berkenblit, Mark Kostabi and Martin Wong. In 1991 she opened Test-Site, the first commercial gallery in what would become a thriving art scene in Williamsburg. She had a short-lived gallery, Black and Herron, in SoHo in 1995, and with Mr. Walczak started Eyewash in Williamsburg in 1997..
        Ms. Herron is survived by a son, Erik, of New York City; by her parents, Robert and Sophie Herron, of Augusta, Ga.; by a sister, Theresa, of New York City; and by four brothers: Anthony and Vincent, both of Augusta; Robert, of Fairfield, Iowa; and Jimmy, of Oakland, Calif.
