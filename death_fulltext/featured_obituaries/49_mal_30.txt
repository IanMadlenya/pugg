        Dr. John Paul Clay, a retired chairman of the chemistry department at Lehman College, part of the City University of New York, died last Wednesday in Ormond Beach, Fla., where he lived in retirement. He was 80 years old and had lived for many years in Mamaroneck, N.Y.
        He died of a heart attack, the university said.
        Dr. Clay, a descendant of John Clay, one of the original Virginia settlers in 1613, and of the statesman Henry Clay, was born in Dawson, Ga. He graduated from the University of Georgia and received his doctorate in chemistry from Columbia.
        He served for six years in the Army during and after World War II, rising to the rank of colonel. In 1949 and 1950 he studied Germany's technology in chemical warfare as an adviser to the European Command. From 1952 to 1954 he was the first scientific director of the Dugway Proving Ground in Utah.
        He joined the faculty of Hunter College in 1938 and rose to full professor, becoming department chairman when Hunter's Bronx campus became Lehman College in 1968. He retired in 1976.
        Dr. Clay is survived by his wife, the former Elizabeth Guye; three daughters, Suzanne Storm of Slingerlands, N.Y., Paulette Dresser of Mamaroneck, and Carol Yocom of Phoenixville, Pa., and seven grandchildren.
