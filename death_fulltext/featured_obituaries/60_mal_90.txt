        Milton Blutnick, who survived two Nazi camps and became a leader in organizations dedicated to commemorating the Holocaust and helping its survivors, died on Wednesday at his home in Forest Hills, Queens. He was 69 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Blutnick was born in Zawiercie, Poland. Dozens of his relatives were killed in Germany's persecution of Jews, and he was imprisoned four years, at the Bergen-Belsen death camp and at another camp.
        After World War II, while awaiting entry to the United States, he spent seven years helping rehabilitate displaced people.
        Later, as a hotel and real-estate executive in New York, Mr. Blutnick was a leader and philanthropist in Holocaust, Jewish and Israeli causes. He helped create the museum at Bergen-Belsen, publish works by Elie Wiesel and others, and organize Bergen-Belsen pilgrimages and memorial ceremonies.
        He was a founding contributor to the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington and the Museum of Jewish Heritage and A Living Memorial to the Holocaust Museum in New York City.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Dora Finkelstein; two sons, Joel, of Towaco, N.J., and Howard, of Great Neck, L.I.; a sister, Lily Tykocinski of Forest Hills, and two brothers, Abraham, of Boca Raton, Fla., and Jacob, of Lake Worth, Fla.
        Correction:  January 21, 1992, Tuesday
        An obituary on Sunday about a Holocaust survivor who was active in organizations that helped other survivors misspelled his name. He was Milton Butnick.
