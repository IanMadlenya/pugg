        Dr. Herbert B. Wilcox Jr., who practiced and taught medicine for four decades and whose patients included Winston Churchill and Sir Anthony Eden, died on Feb. 5 at the Evergreen Woods retirement home in North Branford, Conn. He was 88.
        Dr. Wilcox, an internist, was a staff doctor and associate professor of medicine at the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons and lived in Riverdale, the Bronx, until his retirement in 1974. He and his wife, Elizabeth, then moved to Redding, Conn., and in 1992 entered the North Branford retirement home.
        He was a graduate of Yale and the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, and was involved in research in cardiology at Johns Hopkins Medical School in Baltimore in 1936 and 1937.
        He was an Army lieutenant colonel in World War II and served at the Second General Hospital in England. While in England, he treated Churchill for a while. After the war, he saw Sir Anthony, then in New York with the United Nations, as a patient.
        Dr. Wilcox, a volunteer with a number of organizations, was on several boards, including that of the National Committee for Resettlement of Foreign Physicians.
        Survivors include his wife, Elizabeth, of North Branford; three sons, Herbert 3d, of North Hero, Vt., Gordon, of Seattle, and Thomas, of Concord, Mass.; two brothers, George Gunton Wilcox of North Branford and George Jarvis Geer Wilcox of Easton, Md., and five grandchildren.
