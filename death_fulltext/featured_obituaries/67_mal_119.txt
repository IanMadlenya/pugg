        Dai Vernon, a sleight-of-hand artist who was a mentor to many of the most accomplished magicians of the last half-century, died Aug. 21 at the home of a son, Edward Wingfield Verner, in Ramona, Calif., where he had lived for the last two years. He was 98 years old.
        Many magicians called Mr. Vernon "The Professor" because he was the inventor of hundreds of tricks that magicians now routinely perform and because he shared his knowledge so liberally, said Charles Reynolds, a friend and former pupil.
        Ricky Jay, a sleight-of-hand artist and historian of magic, wrote earlier this year that Mr. Vernon was "without question the most influential, compelling, and venerable figure in the venerable art of sleight-of-hand." He Tricked Houdini
        Born in Ottawa as David Frederick Wingfield Verner, Mr. Vernon learned his first tricks at age 7 from his father, a government worker and amateur magician. He studied mechanical engineering but by his early 20's had moved to New York City and embarked on what would prove to be a lifelong career.
        His reputation was secured as a young man when he performed a card trick for Harry Houdini that the great escapist, who prided himself on being able to unravel any other magician's work, could not decipher.
        Mr. Vernon moved to Los Angeles in 1963 and helped found the Academy of Magical Arts, a private dinner club and magic emporium in Hollywood popularly known as the Magic Castle.  He retired from performing in 1990.
        In addition to his son Edward, he is survived by another son, David D. Verner of Tuckahoe, N.Y.
