        Henry A. Scheel, a yacht designer who brought innovations to boating at a time when tradition prevailed, died on Friday at Penobscot Bay Medical Center in Rockport, Me. He was 81.
        The cause of death was heart failure, said Dr. Daniel Mattox, his physician.
        A naval architect who studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1930's, Mr. Scheel set up his first design office in New York City in 1946. In 1971, he and three associates started Scheel Yachts, a design firm in Rockport.
        During his life, Mr. Scheel developed plans for several hundred yachts, most of which were sailboats. But his most famous design was the Scheel Keel, a ballast strut for sailboats that was built with a flared shape at the base instead of a straight stem.
        The design was a precursor to the modern bulb keel, a strut built with a weighted bulb at the bottom. Cruising World magazine has estimated that since the first Scheel Keel was made in 1976, more than 2,500 sailboats have been outfitted with the special design.
        "He wasn't afraid to try new things," Jerry Milgram, a professor of ocean engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said of Mr. Scheel. "He was doing things 30 years ago that, today, are not so unusual."
        Mr. Scheel was born in Passaic, N.J., and grew up spending most of his summers along the shores of Cape Cod. In 1931, he raced on Dorade, a 52-foot yawl that won the trans-Atlantic competition that year.
        His boating interests followed him full stride into old age. In the late 1980's, Mr. Scheel entered into an agreement with the Royal Huisman Shipyard in the Netherlands to design three large ocean-going sailboats: Hetairos, Foftein and Coro Coro.
        He was a member of the Cruising Club of America, the New York Yacht Club and the Royal Ocean Racing Club of London.
        He is survived by a sister, Susan Thomas, of Peterborough, N.H.
