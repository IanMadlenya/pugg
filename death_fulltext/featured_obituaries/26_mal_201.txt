        A 1986 book by Professor Fineman, ''Shakespeare's Perjured Eye: The Invention of Poetic Subjectivity in the Sonnets,'' published by the University of California Press, won the James Russell Lowell Award of the Modern Language Association for outstanding book of the year.
        He was on the editorial boards of several journals, including Representations and October. His awards included a Mellon postdoctoral fellowship in 1976 and a Guggenheim Foundation fellowship in 1985.
        Professor Fineman, a native of Manhattan, received a bachelor's degree at the University of California at Berkeley and his doctorate from the State University of New York at Buffalo.
        He is survived by a brother, Elliot, of Ramsey, N.J.
