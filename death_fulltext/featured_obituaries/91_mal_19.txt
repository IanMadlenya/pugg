        Tai Solarin, one of Nigeria's best-known social critics and educators, died on July 27 in the town of Ikenne in southwestern Nigeria, where he had a home. He was 72.
        Mr. Solarin was an intellectual guru for Nigeria's disenchanted and disfranchised for four decades. His writings in magazines and newspapers, highlighting what he called the hypocrisy and vulgarity of the Nigeria of his day, frequently angered people in power.
        He was a vehement critic of military rule in Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, and an ombudsman in three states in 1976 and 1977.
        As a social critic, he could be blunt. In early 1990, he wrote in a newspaper column: "What are the prospects of Nigeria becoming less corrupt in 1990? None whatsoever."
        In his usual garb of sneakers, shorts and khaki hunting cap, Mr. Solarin looked more like a village eccentric than a bank president, which he was for a time after one of his longtime foes, the Nigerian President, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, conferred on him the chairmanship of the newly formed People's Bank in 1989.
        From 1952 to 1955, Mr. Solarin was the principal of Molusi College in western Nigeria. From 1956 to 1976, he was the proprietor and principal of Mayflower School in Ikenne. And from 1959 to 1994, he was the proprietor of Mayflower Junior School, also in Ikenne.
        He served in Britain's Royal Air Force in World War II and studied at the universities of Manchester and London, in the 1950's and 1960's.
        He is survived by his wife of 43 years, the former Sheila Mary Tuer, and two children.
