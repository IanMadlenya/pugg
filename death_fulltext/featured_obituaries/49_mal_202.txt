        Alan T. Schumacher, a retired investment banker, died on Sunday at his home in Newport, R.I. He was 78 years old.
        He died in his sleep, a spokesman for the family said.
        Mr. Schumacher joined the Empire Trust Company in Manhattan in 1939. He was named a vice president in 1961. Empire later merged with the Bank of New York, with Mr. Schumacher retaining his post as vice president.
        He retired in 1967 and moved to Newport, where he wrote articles for the Newport Historical Society and was a founding member of the United States Naval War College Foundation.
        His first wife, the former Phyllis Gillespie, died in 1973.
        Mr. Schumacher is survived by his wife, the former Diana Kissell Barnard.
