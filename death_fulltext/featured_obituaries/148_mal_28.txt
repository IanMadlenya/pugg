        Ronald Alley, a longtime staff member of the Tate Gallery in London and its first Keeper of the Modern Collection, died on April 25 in London. He was 73.
        His family did not announce the cause of death.
        After studying art history at the Courtauld Institute in London, Mr. Alley joined the staff of the Tate in 1951. It was a time when the status of modern art was still much debated in Britain. Mr. Alley said later that Britain's public galleries did not have ''a single painting or sculpture that occupies a key position in the development of 20th-century art.''
        There was a long list of distinguished modern artists who were not represented at the Tate. Nor was there any sense of urgency in that regard. When he retired from the Tate in 1986, Mr. Alley said that this was ''partly because the gallery had been starved, and partly because most of our predecessors didn't like modern art.''
        During Mr. Alley's 21 years as the Keeper of the Modern Collection, there was steady though far from comprehensive change in that situation.
        In 1964 he produced a pioneering catalogue raisonne of the work of Francis Bacon. He also catalogued the progress of the Tate's modern collection during his tenure.
        He married a sculptor, Anthea Oswell. They divorced in 1973. Mr. Alley is survived by their two daughters.
