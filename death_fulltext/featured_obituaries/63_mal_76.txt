        Deane Keller, a portrait painter and former professor of art at Yale University, died on Sunday at the Whitney Center, a medical unit in Hamden, Conn. He was 90 years old and lived in Hamden.
        He died of pneumonia and complications from hypertension, said his son, Deane G. Keller.
        Mr. Keller painted many portraits of academicians and politicians, including one of Senator Robert A. Taft that hangs in the Senate reception chamber at the Capitol in Washington. At Yale, he was regarded as unofficial portraitist of the faculty, having done more than 75 paintings.
        Mr. Keller was born in New Haven on Dec. 14, 1901. He graduated from Yale in 1923 and received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree there in 1926. After several years as a fellow at the American Academy in Rome, he returned to teach drawing and painting at the Yale School of Fine Arts, remaining there from 1929 to 1970.
        During World War II, he served as a fine-arts officer with the Fifth Army in Italy, where he was responsible for the identification and transportation of artworks in Tuscany. For his work there, he received the Legion of Merit, the Member of the British Empire medal and the Order of St. John Lateran from the Vatican.
        In addition to his son, of Marlborough, Conn., he is survived by his wife, Katherine Parkhurst Hall Keller; another son, William B., of Baltimore; two sisters, Elsa Melhorn and Caroline Keller, both of Haddonfield, N.J., and one grandchild.
