        Alton Howe Clingan, a composer whose works have recently been performed in New York City, Boston and Amsterdam, died on Tuesday at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 27.
        John Thomason, the manager of a funeral home in Vicksburg, Miss., said the cause of death was under investigation. Mr. Clingan's parents, Dr. Robert C. Clingan and Nancy Clingan, live in Vicksburg.
        Mr. Clingan was born in San Antonio in 1969 and grew up in Honolulu. He studied composition at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, N.Y., and at Columbia University. He was working on his doctorate at Harvard University.
        In his two years at Columbia, Mr. Clingan had several pieces performed in Manhattan. One of them, "The Runaway Horses," was a piano quintet inspired by Mishima's novel about the trials of adolescence. After a performance by Ensemble 21 in October 1993, a review in The New York Times praised Mr. Clingan's style for its "harmonic prickliness, rhythmic complexity and density of ideas."
        Mr. Clingan also contributed string quintet music to "Circle of Faith: The Words of Seattle," a setting of an 1854 speech by Chief Seattle in which Mr. Clingan's music and traditional American Indian drumming were combined. The work, commissioned by the bassist James Van Demark, had performances all over the United States in 1992 and '93. Sections of it were heard on National Public  Radio.
        In addition to his parents, Mr. Clingan is survived by his grandparents, Col. and Mrs. O. E. Howe of Kailua, Hawaii.
