        Joaquin E. Bacardi, a retired president of the rum company founded by his grandfather, died Tuesday at his home in Nassau, the Bahamas, after suffering from heart problems. He was 85 years old.
        Mr. Bacardi, who spent his entire career with the company, was born in Santiago, Cuba, where Don Facundo Bacardi established the company in 1862, using $3,500 in capital, a small cast iron still and a formula for light, dry rum. Within 14 years, the rum was acclaimed internationally.
        When he died in 1886, the business was taken over by his sons, Emilio Facundo and Jose. Jose was Joaquin Bacardi's father.
        Joaquin Bacardi started his career in Cuba as technical director of Hatuey Brewery, a predecessor to the Bacardi Corporation. After the 1959 revolution in Cuba, Mr. Bacardi and other family members moved to Bermuda, where he served as president of Bacardi International Ltd., one of several companies within the business. Bacardi Imports is based in Miami.
        Survivors include a daughter, Carmen; three sons, Joaquin Eduardo, Jose Alberto and Jorge Enrique, and 14 grandchildren.
