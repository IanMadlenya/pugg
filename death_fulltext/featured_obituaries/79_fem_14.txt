        Arlene Streit Yagoda, an owner and breeder of thoroughbred race horses, died on Tuesday at the Westchester County Medical Center. She was 51 and lived in Woodmere, L.I.
        The cause was cancer, her family said.
        Carrying on a family tradition, she raced horses throughout the country with her husband, and their son Aaron became a handicapper, starting at the age of 8. The columnist Red Smith wrote about a typical day at Aqueduct when Aaron, then 10, picked six winners, the daily double and an exacta.
        Mrs. Yagoda, who was born in Brooklyn, graduated from Hofstra University. Her grandfather, Aaron, founded the Streit Matzoh Company.
        She was married for 30 years to Stanley Yagoda, who was president of the Hot Dogger clothing company.
        Besides her husband, her survivors include her parents, Ruth and Jack Streit of Brooklyn; two sons, Phillip, of Manhattan, and Aaron, of Manhattan and Hallendale, Fla., and two sisters, Myrna Heilbrun of Manhattan and Nettie Streit of Brooklyn.
        Correction:  August 21, 1993, Saturday
        An obituary yesterday about an owner and breeder of thoroughbred horses rendered her first name incorrectly, as did the headline. She was Arlyne (not Arlene) Streit Yagoda.
