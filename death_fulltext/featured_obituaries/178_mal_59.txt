        Robert H. Heilbrunn, an investor and philanthropist, died on Sunday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 93 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
        He began investing during the Depression and prospered through value investing, which is investing in undervalued securities.
        Born in Brooklyn, he attended the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania for a year. His father died just before the crash of 1929, leaving Robert, the only child, as the sole support of his mother.
        His father left a stock portfolio that was devastated by the crash, but Robert learned about investing and went on to entrust funds to prominent value investors.
        He and his wife were generous contributors to many organizations. When he was 80, his family established the Robert H. Heilbrunn Chair of Value Investing at Columbia. Other beneficiaries included Mount Sinai Hospital, the American Jewish Committee, the Rockefeller University, UJA-Federation of New York and the American Heart Association.
        Surviving are his wife of 67 years, the former Harriet Rothkopf; two daughters, Helaine Lerner of Manhattan and Joan Rechnitz of New Jersey; three grandchildren; and a great-grandson.
