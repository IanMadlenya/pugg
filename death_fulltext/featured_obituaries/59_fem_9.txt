        Margaret Eyring Moreland, a psychologist who practiced in New York for many years, died on Friday at the New England Medical Center in Boston. She was 76 years old and lived in Yarmouth Port, Mass.
        She died after a brief illness, her family said.
        Mrs. Moreland, a native of New York City, graduated from City College and Fordham University, where she earned a master's degree in clinical psychology. She began her career in 1940 at the New York Domestic Relations Court. In World War II she served as an Army psychologist and then worked at several institutions in New York, Buffalo and Niagara Falls, N.Y. She retired as an educational psychologist at City College in 1980.
        At her death she was a board member at Access House, a safe haven for abused teen-aged girls in Falmouth. A summer resident of Cape Cod since 1969, she moved there permanently two years ago.
        She is survived by son, Don, of Harwich, Mass., and a brother, Edward J. Eyring of Langhorne, Pa.
