        Dave Prater Sr., of the soul-singing duo Sam and Dave, was killed Saturday when the car he was driving went off Interstate 75 near Sycamore, Ga., and hit a tree. He was 50 years old.
        A passenger, Charmaine C. Marks, 46, of Union City, Ga., was listed in serious condition early today at Tift County General Hospital in Tifton, Ga., according to Georgia state troopers.
        Mr. Prater had lived in Paterson since 1974 and his body will be returned to New Jersey for burial next week, his widow, Rosemary, said Monday.
        Mr. Prater met his partner, Sam Moore, in Miami in 1958. Their Memphis-style soul, including their work on the Isaac Hayes-David Porter hit ''Hold On, I'm Comin,' '' won them popularity through the 1960's and a Grammy Award for ''Soul Man.'' But by the early 1970's, their popularity had waned and they broke up in 1981.
        Mr. Prater resumed the Sam and Dave act in 1982, but with a new partner, Sam Daniels, of Miami.
        Mr. Prater was arrested last summer in Paterson for selling a vial of crack to an undercover police officer. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years' probation and ordered to pay a $2,580 fine and perform community service.
        He is survived by his wife, of Paterson, his mother, Mary, of Ocilla, Ga., and by five children from an earlier marriage.
