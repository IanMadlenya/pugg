        John Cannon, president of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, died on Friday in Cologne, Germany. He was 74.
        The cause was apparently a heart attack, reported Variety, the show business journal.
        Mr. Cannon, who was president of the academy for 25 years, supervised the daytime Emmy Awards as well as the annual Emmys awarded to news, documentary, science and sports shows and those given for public service programs. The prime-time Emmy Awards and those involving Los Angeles-area programming are presented by the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, based in North Hollywood. The two academies split in 1977.
        Born in Chicago, Mr. Cannon began his career as a radio and television announcer, appearing on shows like ''Your Hit Parade'' and ''Studio One.'' He was also the voice of the Fox Movietone newsreels in the 1950's.
        He is survived by his wife, Trudy Wilson Cannon, and a daughter, Connie, both of New York City.
