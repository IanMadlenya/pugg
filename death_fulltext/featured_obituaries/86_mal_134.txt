        John A. Burgess, president of the Graphic Arts Technical Foundation, a research and educational institute in Pittsburgh, died on Friday at Presbyterian University Hospital in Pittsburgh. He was 63 and lived in Mount Lebanon, a suburb of Pittsburgh.
        The cause was complications after surgery, his family said.
        Mr. Burgess spent 29 years at the foundation, beginning as a special assistant for development and planning. He became president in 1990.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary, and two daughters, Kimberly Barata of Pittsburgh and Elizabeth Burgess of Seattle.
