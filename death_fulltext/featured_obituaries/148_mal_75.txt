        Marvin S. Winter, a Manhattan real estate developer for more than 50 years, died on Friday at New York University Hospital in Manhattan. He was 78 and had homes in Manhattan and Delray Beach, Fla.
        The cause of death was heart failure, said his son James, of Rye Brook, N.Y.
        Mr. Winter, whose father, Benjamin, was a prominent real estate developer in New York City early in the century, was born on Aug. 21, 1920, in Manhattan. He was graduated from Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Va., in 1941.
        After college and service in the Army, Mr. Winter entered the family business and expanded it into the commercial and residential real estate markets in Chicago, Philadelphia, Miami and other cities.
        His holdings in Manhattan included 800 Fifth Avenue, at 61st Street, a commercial and residential building constructed on the site of the former Dodge mansion; 730 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, known as the Crown Building, and 210 Central Park South.
        Mr. Winter was also a founding director of the Community National Bank of Staten Island, which was later sold to Chemical Bank.
        Besides his son James, Mr. Winter is survived by his wife, Eleanor; two other sons, Benjamin of Rye, N.Y., and Douglas of Highland Park, Ill.; a daughter, Karen Miller of Sudbury, Mass.; two sisters, Ethel Schanzer and Natalie Ballen, both of Manhattan, and 10 grandchildren.
