        Roy O. Allen Jr., an architect whose work included the enormous 1 Liberty Plaza skyscraper in lower Manhattan and the Annenberg Building at the Mount Sinai Medical Center, died on Wednesday at Presbyterian Hospital in Pittsburgh. He was 71 years old and lived in Miami.
        He died of liver failure, his wife, Marion, said.
        Mr. Allen was born in Athens, Pa. He graduated from Pennsylvania State University in 1943 and joined the New York office of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill three years later. He was a senior design partner at that firm from 1960 until 1980, when he retired.
        In 1973, 1 Liberty Plaza, on Broadway between Liberty and Cortlandt Streets, was completed as the United States Steel Building. It is notable for its use of huge steel girders on the exterior. At 54 stories and 2 million square feet, it is also one of the largest office towers in New York. The 31-story Annenberg Building, at 99th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues, was completed in 1976. It, too, dominates its surroundings.
        Among Mr. Allen's other projects were the General Electric Company headquarters in Fairfield, Conn., and the Goldman, Sachs headquarters at 85 Broad Street in lower Manhattan.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by three sons, Michael, of Miami; Jeffrey, of East Patchogue, L.I., and Gary, of East Quogue, L.I.; a daughter, Leslie, of Fairfield, Calif., and two grandchildren.
