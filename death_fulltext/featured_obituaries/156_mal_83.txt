        Makhmud Esambayev, a Chechen ballet dancer who achieved wide recognition in the Soviet Union for his virtuosic folk dancing, died in Moscow on Jan. 7. He was 75.
        The Itar-Tass press agency said he died after a long illness.
        Mr. Esambayev's artistry in theatricalized ethnic dances thrilled Soviet audiences for decades, beginning with ''Dances of Many Nations,'' a program he first presented in 1957. Leading ballet choreographers, including Leonid Yakobson, created works for Mr. Esambayev, who was considered a top-ranking Soviet dancer.
        Named a Hero of Socialist Labor in 1984 and a People's Artist of the Soviet Union in 1974 by the government, he served as deputy to the Supreme Soviet, the parliament of the former Soviet Union.
        Mr. Esambayev was born in the Chechen village of Stariya Atogi and studied at the Grozny Ballet School from 1938 to 1941. During World War II, which interrupted his training, he appeared with army entertainment units on the front lines.
        From 1944 to 1956 he performed with the ballet company in Frunze, Kirghizia (now Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan), appearing mainly in character roles or dramatic parts. In 1957 he returned to Chechnya, where he taught in the 1990's. He also founded the Premier Ballet Theater of Moscow. He was married and had a daughter, Itar-Tass said.
