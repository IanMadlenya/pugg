        Johann Baptist Gradl, a former minister in the West German Government who had worked for German reunification, died here Friday after a long illness, city officials said. He was 84 years old.
        Mr. Gradl helped found the Christian Democratic Union party in Berlin in 1945. He fled Soviet-controlled East Berlin two years later, after disagreements with Communist authorities.
        Mr. Gradl represented West Berlin from 1957 to 1980 as a member of West Germany's Parliament. He also served as federal minister for German exiles in 1965-66. From 1969 to 1972, he was chairman of the Bundestag Committee for German-German Relations.
        Chancellor Helmut Kohl said on Saturday that Mr. Gradl had ''devoted his life to German reunification.''
