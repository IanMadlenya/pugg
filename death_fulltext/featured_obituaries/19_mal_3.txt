        Seymour M. Klein, a lawyer who prosecuted several gangland figures as an assistant United States Attorney in the 1930's, died Sunday of complications after surgery at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. He was 79 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        At his death, Mr. Klein was a partner in the law firm of Shea & Gould. For many years he was a leading figure in the nominating of candidates for New York judgeships, a role he took as an official of the Bar Association of the City of New York and as a member of mayoral and gubernatorial nominating panels.
        He was also active in philanthropic and cultural activities. He served in various capacities with the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art and the New York Public Library. He was also a past president and chairman of the 92d Street Young Men's and Young Women's Hebrew Association and a trustee of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies.
        Mr. Klein, a native of Manhattan, graduated Phi Beta Kappa from City College and was a graduate of Harvard Law School. He served form 1932 to 1939 in the United States Attorney's office in Manhattan. Among the notorious figures he prosecuted was John Torrio, the Chicago gangster who was sent to prison for income-tax evasion in 1939. In 1935 he won the conviction of ''Count'' Victor Lustig, whose real name was Robert V. Miller, a master counterfeiter and swindler who had previously been arrested 37 times over five years but had not been convicted.
        Mr. Klein is survived by his wife, the former Ruth Liberman; two sons, Jeffrey and Donald, both of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
