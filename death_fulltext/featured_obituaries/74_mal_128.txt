        Matthew Schoenwald, a retired vice president of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union in New York, died on Monday at Hollywood Medical Center in Florida. He was 77 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, said his son, Dr. Michael Schoenwald of Hollywood.
        Mr. Schoenwald retired in 1984 from the board of the I.L.G.W.U. but remained director of its Retiree Service Department until four years ago. He was a longtime manager of the Intimate Apparel Workers Union, Local 62-32.
        He was born in Poland, received a degree in accounting from New York University in 1941 and served with the infantry in Europe in World War II.
        He was a delegate to the White House Conference on Aging in 1971 and 1981 and also served as president of the New York State Council of Senior Citizens.
        Mr. Schoenwald is survived by his wife of 21 years, the former Ruth Davidson; another son, Dr. Jeff Schoenwald of Thousand Oaks, Calif.; two stepsons, Dr. Glenn Brown of Phoenix and Gary Brown of Tarrytown, N.Y.; two brothers, Sam and Yaffa, both of Queens, and five grandchildren.
