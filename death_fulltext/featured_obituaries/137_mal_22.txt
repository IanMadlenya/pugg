        Stephen Yung Nien Tse, a retired senior executive of American International Group, an insurance company in New York, died on Wednesday at his home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He was 67.
        The cause was cancer of the head and neck, his family said.
        Mr. Tse retired in 1996 as president of AIG Associates and senior vice president of its parent, American International.
        A native of Shanghai, he graduated from Wayland Academy of Beaver Dam, Wis., and the University of Wisconsin. In 1956 he went to work for C. V. Starr, the founder of American International, and rose through the corporate ranks in Hong Kong and New York as a member of its financial management team.
        Mr. Tse is survived by his wife of 40 years, Margaret M. Lock Tse; four sons, Chida Tse of Paradise Valley, Ariz., Chiming Tse of Montclair, N.J., Chiyung Tse of Seattle, and Chikai Tse of Poughquag, N.Y., and 11 grandchildren.
