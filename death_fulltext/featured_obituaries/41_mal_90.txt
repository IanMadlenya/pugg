        Sir James Carreras, who as head of Hammer Films produced horror movies that chilled a generation of filmgoers, died of a stroke on Saturday at his home at Henley-on-Thames, west of London, according to a death notice published by his family. He was 81 years old.
        He built up the Hammer company after World War II, and in the mid-1950's he began making the gruesome low-budget horror films for which the English studio became internationally famous.
        His first big hit and the first Hammer film to be distributed in the United States was ''The Quatermass Experiment,'' based on a 1954 television science-fiction series.
        In Search of Monsters
        The horror aspects of that film inspired him to look for material among the creatures popular with filmgoers in the 1930's. He resurrected the Frankenstein monster, Dracula and characters of legend and novel that had faded from the screen.
        ''The Curse of Frankenstein'' in 1956 struck a chord with the public with its fantastic sets, garish color and melodramatic plot.
        Hammer horror films helped the careers of two actors who became synonymous with escapist horror fare: Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. Mr. Lee played Dracula in nearly a dozen films.
