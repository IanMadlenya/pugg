        Henry Steeger 3d, a publisher and a past president of the National Urban League, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 87 years old.
        He died of bone cancer, his daughter Nancy Jennings of Manhattan, said.
        Mr. Steeger led the Urban League from 1960 to 1964. Previously he had been senior vice president. In 1961 he warned the organization's convention in Dayton, Ohio, that a social explosion was probable unless something was done to give blacks equal rights and equal opportunities.
        Mr. Steeger was a co-founder and president of Popular Publications Inc., which published popular detective and western story magazines like Argosy, Black Mask, Adventure, Dime Detective and Star Western. It also published the Spider, a comic that inspired Batman and Spiderman. Popular Publications was acquired by another company in 1972 and went out of business in 1979. 'Honest Abe'
        Using his nickname, Harry, Mr. Steeger wrote a column for Argosy. Called "Honest Abe," it was devoted largely to tall tales of hunting and fishing. He was also a former tournament tennis player and won the Long Island senior singles title several times.
        He was a native New Yorker and was educated at the Trinity School and the Horace Mann school. He graduated from Princeton University in 1925.
        During World War II he was a lieu-tenant commander in the Coast Guard and remained active in reserve affairs after the war.
        Besides his daughter, he is survived by his wife, the former Shirley Meeker; another daughter, Suzanne Hall of Manhattan, and six grandchildren.
