        Dr. Howard G. Bruenn, a naval physician who attended to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the year before his death, died on Saturday in Sorrento, Me. He was 90 years old.
        Mr. Bruenn and his wife, Dorothy, had a summer home in Maine, but kept their permanent residence in the Riverdale section of the Bronx.
        Dr. Bruenn was present when President Roosevelt suffered the massive brain hemorrhage that killed him on April 12, 1945, in Warm Springs, Ga. The doctor reported the President's last words: "I have a terrific headache."
        "At 1 o'clock," Dr. Bruenn told reporters at the time, "he was sitting in a chair while sketches were being made of him by an artist. He suddenly complained of a very severe occipital headache.
        "Within a very few minutes he lost consciousness," he said.
        Born in Youngstown, Ohio, Dr. Bruenn graduated from Columbia University in 1925 and from Johns Hopkins Medical School in 1929. He enlisted in the Navy in 1942 and was commissioned a Lieutenant Commander.
        Shortly after a transfer to Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland, where he was chief of cardiology, Dr. Bruenn gave President Roosevelt a routine physical examination and was then assigned to be the President's attending physician.
        After the President's death, Dr. Bruenn had a private practice until he retired in 1975.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by three children, Stephen W. of Boca Raton, Fla.; Nancy Clement of Clearwater, Fla.; and James H. of West Stockbridge, Mass.; and a grandson, Joshua Clement, of Portland, Ore.
