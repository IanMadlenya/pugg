        Carlton H. Lee Jr., the Congressional liaison officer for the National Commission on AIDS and a key figure in Congressional approval of civil rights legislation affecting people with AIDS and other disabilities, died on Friday at Presbyterian University Hospital in Pittsburgh. He was 35 years old.
        Mr. Lee, who was known by his friends as Sonny, contracted hepatitis B when he served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Sierre Leone, West Africa, from 1981 to 1986. The commission said he had a toxic reaction to an experimental drug that he was taking as part of a clinical trial by the National Institutes of Health.
        From 1987 to 1989, Mr. Lee was a lobbyist for the Human Rights Campaign Fund. Since 1989, Mr. Lee was the chief lobbyist for the National Commission on AIDS, where he also served as an adviser to the commission's chairwoman, Dr. June E. Osborn.
        Mr. Lee grew up in Snyder, Tex., and was a graduate of American University in Washington.
        He is survived by his parents, Carlton and Joy Lee of Snyder, and three sisters, Annette Truluck of Charleston, S.C.; Darliene Kriewald of Austin, Tex., and Susan Humble of Levelland, Tex.
