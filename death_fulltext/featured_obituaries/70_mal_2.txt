        George M. Ferris, a retired investment banker and philanthropist in Washington, died Thursday at his home in Chevy Chase, Md. He was 99 years old.
        He died of arteriosclerosis, his family said.
        Mr. Ferris was a founder and former president and chairman of the Washington Stock Exchange, now part of the Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington Stock Exchange.
        Founded during the Depression, Ferris & Company became one of Washington's oldest and biggest investment banking firms. It joined the New York Stock Exchange and expanded with branches throughout the mid-Atlantic region. In 1988 the firm merged into Ferris, Baker Watts Inc., and Mr. Ferris retired as chairman emeritus.
        Mr. Ferris was chairman of the National Cathedral School for Girls and president of the National Homeopathic Hospital, the old Hahnemann Hospital in Washington, the Bond Club of Washington and Columbia Country Club. He also served on the boards of Sibley Memorial Hospital, the Boys Club of Washington, Trinity College and Chevy Chase Village and was a fund raising chairman for the United Givers Fund.
        His wife of 67 years, the former Charlotte Hamilton, died in 1986.
        He is survived by a daughter, Gene Ferris Benedict of McLean, Va.; a son, George Jr., of Chevy Chase; 10 grandchildren, and 16 great-grandchildren.
