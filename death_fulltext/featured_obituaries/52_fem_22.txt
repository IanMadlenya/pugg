        Edwina Booth, an actress who made headlines in the 1930's when a mysterious illness ended her film career, died Saturday. She was 86 years old.
        Miss Booth, whose death had been erroneously reported several times since she contracted an illness while filming "Trader Horn" in Africa, died in the Medallion Convalescent Hospital in Long Beach, her brother, Booth Woodruff, said.
        "Her death has been wrongly reported so many times, including recently in the book 'The Making of the African Queen' by Katharine Hepburn," Mr. Woodruff said. "But this time she really did die."
        Miss Booth appeared in the films "Manhattan Cocktail" in 1928, "Our Modern Maidens" in 1929, and serials like "The Vanishing Legion" and "The Last of the Mohicans." But it was her role in "Trader Horn" and her subsequent illness that made headlines. Silent Became a Talkie
        The film, a melodrama about the so-called "white goddess" of an African tribe, began as a silent picture but ended as one of Hollywood's new "talkies." The cast and film crew had to mark time in Africa for several weeks waiting for the new sound equipment to arrive.
        After release of the film in 1931, Miss Booth became ill and was confined to bed for more than five years. She sued Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for more than $1 million, claiming that the studio had failed to safeguard her health in Africa while the movie was being made. The suit was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount. Miss Booth never made another movie.
        Miss Booth's husband, Reinhold Fehlberg, died in 1984.
        In addition to her brother, Miss Booth is survived by a sister, Betty Benson, and two stepdaughters, Judy Larson and Dixie Nelson.
