        Joseph J. Greenberg, the sculptor of the black granite Bear and Cub at the Philadelphia Zoo and many other public sculptures, has died of heart failure. He was 75 years old.
        Mr. Greenberg, a versatile and prolific artist, produced works ranging from realistic stone carvings of animals to stylized Fiberglas figures and abstract bronzes.
        Many of his public sculptures are in Philadelphia, but he said one of his favorites was the 60-foot-high welded steel Symbol of Progress he made in 1967 for the Civic Center in Bethlehem, Pa.
        He is survived by his wife, Sheila; a son and a sister. A memorial service is planned at the Ethical Society of Philadelphia on Rittenhouse Square at 4 P.M. next Wednesday.
