        Lillian Hayman, a Tony Award-winning actress and singer, died on Oct. 25 at her home in Hollis, N.Y. She was 72.
        The cause was a heart attack, said her sister, Coreania Carter.
        Miss Hayman won a Tony in 1968 as best supporting actress for her performance in the musical "Hallelujah Baby." She appeared in many other Broadway productions, including "Kiss Me Kate," "Show Boat," "Kwamina," "70, Girls, 70," "No, No, Nanette" and "Porgy and Bess," with which she traveled for its entire three-and-a-half-year world tour. She also appeared in several Off Broadway plays, including "Dream About Tomorrow" and "Along Came a Spider."
        Miss Hayman had a role in the soap opera "One Life to Live" for 17 years, as the character Sadie Gray, and was a regular on the short-lived "Leslie Uggams Show" in 1969. She also recorded a gospel album, "My Prayer," and appeared in the film "Purlie Victorious."
        Lillian Irene Hayman was born in Maryland and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Wilberforce University in Ohio. She then studied music privately in New York where she became the director of several church choirs.
        She is survived by her sister, of St. Albans, Queens.
