        Theodore Spagna, a photographer and film maker who specialized in scientific material, died Wednesday at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston. He was 45 years old.
        He died of of brain lymphoma, said Robert Beers, his longtime companion.
        Mr. Spagna, who studied architecture at Cooper Union in Manhattan and film making at Boston University, pioneered in time-lapse studies of sleeping animals and people. He developed a nonintrusive technique for filming people as they slept and was associated with a sleep-research project conducted at Harvard Medical School.
        His photographs showed that sleepers become inactive while dreaming. He also helped create an exhibit entitled ''Dreamstage: A Multi-Media Portrait of the Sleeping Brain,'' that converts brain waves of a sleeping person into a light and music show.
        Mr. Spagna, who lived in Boston and New York, is survived by a sister, Carol Eldredge, of Flushing, Queens.
