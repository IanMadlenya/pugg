        Dr. Timothy Melester, a Manhattan surgeon and educator, died yesterday at St. Vincent's Hospital. He was 40 and lived in TriBeCa.
        The cause was complications from AIDS, said his companion, Craig Lucas, the playwright.
        At his death, Dr. Melester was chief of surgical education at St. Vincent's and an associate professor of surgery at New York Medical College.
        He graduated from the College of William and Mary and the University of Virginia School of Medicine, and received surgical training at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, where he was a faculty member.
        From the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, he placed a high priority on providing surgical services to H.I.V.-infected patients. He wrote extensively on the subject of AIDS and he was involved with a number of AIDS education programs in New York. He was also a consultant to the American Civil Liberties Union and the New York State Department of Mental Health.
        He is also survived by his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Clyde Melester of Winchester, Va.; a brother, Steven, and a sister, Elizabeth Wojcik of Raleigh, N.C.
