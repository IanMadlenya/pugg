        Charles L. Sanders, the managing editor of Ebony magazine since 1968, died at Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago on Thursday. He was 58 years old.
        Lydia Davis, a spokeswoman for Ebony's publisher, the Johnson Publishing Company in Chicago, said the cause of death was unknown.
        Mr. Sanders began working at Ebony, a monthly magazine devoted to black life, in 1963 as an associate editor. Two years later he opened Johnson's first overseas bureau, in Paris. During that assignment he wrote a weekly column, ''Paris Scratchpad,'' for Jet magazine, a Johnson Company news weekly.
        Mr. Sanders was a board member of Gospel Music Workshop of America and served with Bill Cosby as co-chairman of the N.A.A.C.P.'s Entertainment Committee for Life Members.
        He is survived by two sisters, Ora West of Victoria, Tex., and Linda Fitzgerald of Cleveland, and a brother, Sidney Phillips of Los Angeles.
