        John Brian Harley, a professor of geography who was a leading expert on the history of maps, died last Friday in Milwaukee. He was 59 years old.
        He died of a heart attack while driving to his campus office at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, said Prof. David Woodward, a university colleague.
        Dr. Harley, who was a British citizen and held a Ph.D from the University of Birmingham, was the author of several books and hundreds of articles on the history of maps and map making.
        At his death, he was collaborating with Dr. Woodward on a six-volume work titled "The History of Cartography," the second volume of which is to be published in May by the University of Chicago Press. On the basis of volume one, which was published in 1987, a reviewer for The New York Times said the completed work was "certain to be a standard reference for all subsequent scholarship."
        Dr. Woodward said that work on the series would continue and that Dr. Harley's contribution would be evident throughout the remaining volumes.
        Dr. Harley held several academic posts in England before going to the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee in 1986 where, in addition to being a professor of geography, he was director of the Office for Map History at the university's Golda Meir Library, which houses the American Geographical Society's map collection.
        He is survived by three daughters: Karen Richardson of Rickmansworth, England; Claire Harley of London, and Sarah Harley of Milwaukee.
