        Cassandra Ides Jones, a former  executive of the Chase Manhattan Bank and the owner of an interior design company, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. Mrs. Jones, who was 48, died of breast cancer, her husband, Robert Childress Jones Jr., said.
        Mrs. Jones was among the first group of women junior executives whose careers moved into a higher gear in 1978 when Chase settled a sex discrimination lawsuit brought two years earlier by 18 other women.
        She worked in the bank's international institutional and corporate departments, as country officer for Bermuda, in credit positions in Milan, Italy, and New York and in private banking before leaving the bank in 1988 and opening De La Verne Design, an interior design firm. One of her private banking clients, the interior designer John Saladino, named his Cassandra chair after her.
        In addition to her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Caroline and Claire, and a brother, William Ides of Huntington, L.I.
