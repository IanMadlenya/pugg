        Roger D. Hansen, a professor of international relations at Johns Hopkins University's Nitze School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, was found dead Friday at the home of a friend in Rehoboth Beach, Del. He was 55 years old and lived in Washington.
        Dr. Hansen took his life by inhaling carbon monoxide from his car, the police in Rehoboth Beach said. Colleagues at Johns Hopkins, where Dr. Hansen had taught for 15 years, said he had a severe back ailment that had required major operations.
        Books by Dr. Hansen, a specialist in economic development and ties between the wealthy Northern Hemisphere and the poorer Southern Hemisphere, include "The Politics of Mexican Development" (The Johns Hopkins Press, 1971), and "Beyond the North-South Stalemate" (McGraw-Hill, 1979).
        Roger Dennis Hansen was a native of Honolulu who earned a bachelor's degree at Yale University, master's degrees at Oxford University, where he was a Rhodes scholar, and at Princeton University and a doctorate at Johns Hopkins.
        Survivors include a brother, Jerry, of Los Gatos, Calif.
