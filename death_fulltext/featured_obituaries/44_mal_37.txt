       Edward Clark Stephan, a retired Navy rear admiral, died Wednesday at Montgomery General Hospital in Olney, Md. He was 83 years old.
        A family spokeswoman said he died of pneumonia.
        Admiral Stephan, who was once the Navy's chief oceanographer, graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1929 and spent most of his career in the submarine service.
        For his actions as a submarine commander in the Pacific in World War II he was awarded the Navy Cross, the second-highest decoration for heroism, after the Medal of Honor, given to Navy, Marine Corps or Coast Guard members. His submarine, operating in Japanese-controlled waters, attacked two convoys and damaged a destroyer and a number of other vessels.
        He also received the Silver Star for other submarine actions against the Japanese.
        Navy's Legislative Liaison
        After the war Admiral Stephan held several submarine commands, served as chief of legislative liaison for the Department of the Navy and commanded a South Atlantic task force.
        From 1960 to 1963 he was head of the Naval Oceanographic Office and was its chief oceanographer. Admiral Stephan was then named chairman of the Deep Submergence Systems Review Group, studying the development of a deep sea rescue-diving bell.
        He retired from active duty in 1964 and became vice president of the Washington office of Ocean Systems Inc. He was the founder and president of the Marine Technology Society and was chairman of the Nassau-Suffolk Marine Resources Council.
        Admiral Stephan, who lived in Silver Spring, Md., is survived by a daughter, Paula Lee of Annapolis, Md.; two sons, David Stephan of Goshen, N.H., and Edward Stephan Jr. of Kensington, Md.; a sister, Elizabeth Joyce of McLean, Va.; seven grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
