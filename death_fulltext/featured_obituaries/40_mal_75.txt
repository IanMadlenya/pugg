        Christopher Chodoff, a New York antiques dealer and furniture designer, died of lung cancer yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 81 years old.
        Mr. Chodoff's shop on East 57th Street was opened in the early 1950's and was among the first to introduce the furniture of some of the great designers of the 1930's to this country -the bronzes of Diego Giacometti, the white plaster lamps and furniture of Jean-Michel Frank and the lacquers of Eileen Gray.
        Mr. Chodoff also sought or designed furniture for customers' homes, often selecting what he found amusing. For the Rome apartment of the fashion designer Valentino, Mr. Chodoff found horn furniture amusing. For the home in Portugal of Antenor Patino, heir to a tin-mining fortune, it was Indian furniture, and for Jane Fonda's house outside Paris, Mr. Chodoff uncovered some fanciful lamps.
        Mr. Chodoff closed his shop in 1979. He continued to make his own designs under the name Chodoff Ltd., which are sold through decorator showrooms in eight cities, including New York.
        Mr. Chodoff's business associate and companion of many years is Maury Green.
