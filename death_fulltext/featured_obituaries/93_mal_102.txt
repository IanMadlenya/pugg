        Thomas Gibbs Gee, a retired judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, died on Tuesday at Methodist Hospital in Houston. He was 69 and lived in Houston.
        He died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease, the court said.
        The most prominent case in which he was a judge involved a 1981 Louisiana law that required the teaching of "creation science" in any public school where the theory of evolution was taught. The law was struck down by a Federal district judge as an unconstitutional attempt to establish religion; that ruling was upheld by a three-judge appeals panel.
        In 1986 the full appellate court rejected, 8 to 7, the state's petition to rehear the case. Judge Gee, writing for the dissenters, said the court record included affidavits "by highly qualified scientists" who believed in evolution only as a theory and argued that "evolution is not established scientific fact."
        In 1987 the United States Supreme Court upheld the Fifth Circuit, ruling 7 to 2 that the Louisiana law was unconstitutional.
        Judge Gee was born in Jacksonville, Fla., and graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1946. He served as a pilot for four years, and received a law degree from the University of Texas in 1953.
        He practiced law in Austin, Tex., until 1973, when he was appointed to the bench by President Richard M. Nixon. Judge Gee retired in 1991.
        At his death he was a partner specializing in appellate matters with Baker & Botts in Houston. He also helped to manage the family land-holding and investment business, Gibbs Brothers & Company in Huntsville, Tex., and his Texas longhorn cattle ranch.
        He is survived by his wife, Deborah Bagg Gee; two daughters, Jennifer Updegraff of Dogpatch, Ark., and Mary Cecile Gee of Los Angeles; two sons, John, of Austin, and Thomas Jr., of Houston, and four grandchildren.
