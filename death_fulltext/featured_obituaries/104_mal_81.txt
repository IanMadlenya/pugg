        Howard C. Miller, founder of Howard Miller, the nation's largest clock manufacturer, died on Thursday at his home in Holland, Mich. He was 90.
        For 69 years, Mr. Miller's business, based in Zeeland, Mich., has designed and manufactured an eclectic array of grandfather, wall and mantel clocks and collectors' cabinets. Many early designs have become collectors' items.
        The company's Museum Clock, designed by Nathan George Horwitt in the 1940's, is in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art. The wall clock, which is numberless and has a black face and white hands, has been praised by art critics as a good example of the overlapping of form and function.
        A ball clock designed for the company by George H. Nelson became a 1950's icon of the atomic era.
        Mr. Miller was born in Grand Rapids, Mich., and moved with his family to Zeeland as a boy. In 1923, after completing his schooling, he spent a year studying clockmaking in the Black Forest of Germany.
        He founded the company, then known as the Howard Miller Clock Company in 1926, serving as its president until 1980, its chairman until 1990 and chairman emeritus until his death. The company also owns Hekman Furniture and Alexis Manufacturing in Grand Rapids, Woodmark Upholstery in High Point, N.C., Brookley Furniture Company in Mobile, Ala., and the Kieninger Clock Company in Aldingen, Germany.
        He is survived by his wife, Martha; two sons, Jack H. of Grand Haven, Mich., the company's president, and Philip D. of Holland, Mich., its executive vice president; a daughter, Constance J. Johnson of Bloomfield Hills, Mich.; eight grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
