        Lamar Crowson, an American pianist who, though little known in the United States, was regarded by many colleagues as one of the finest chamber musicians of his time, died on Aug. 25 in Johannesburg, where he lived. He was 72.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Crowson played with outstanding contemporaries. Alfred Brendel recalled hearing him in partnership with the cellist Jacqueline du Pre, and expressed surprise that a virtuoso of his caliber devoted himself to chamber music. Crowson's own words provide an answer, for he occasionally confessed to finding solo work ''bare and lonely.''
        He was born on May 27, 1926, in Tampa, Fla., and received his early education in Portland, Ore. He went on to study at the Royal College of Music in London, where he joined the faculty in 1957. Meanwhile he had begun his performing career. His repertory as a soloist was wide -- from the sonatas of Haydn and Mozart through big Romantic concertos to new music -- but he quickly came to concentrate on chamber music.
        With the Melos Ensemble of London he made recordings of the Mozart and Beethoven Quintets for piano and wind, Hummel's Quintet and Septet, Schubert's ''Trout'' Quintet and Janacek's Concertino. His flawless rhythmic drive, always intense and compelling, is equally apparent in his recording of the Faure Piano Quartet with the Pro Arte.
        Mr. Crowson settled in South Africa in 1972, teaching at the University of Cape Town.
        He is survived by the sons of his first marriage, John and Paul; by his third wife, Estelle, and by her sons, Hans and Andries Beyers.
