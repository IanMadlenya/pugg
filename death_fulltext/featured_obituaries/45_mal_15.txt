        George Arthur Hornby, a self-educated book designer and producer, died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 78 years old.  He died of complications from a recent stroke, said a daughter, Ann Guilfoyle.
        Mr. Hornby developed an interest in fine printing in his teens in the rare-book room of the library in Providence, R.I. By 1935, at age 23, he had started his own small press, the Domesday Press, in the living room of his home in Meriden, Conn.
        Over the next five decades Mr. Hornby worked as a freelancer or staff member with Knopf, Crown, Random House, Crowell-Collier, Rowman & Littlefield, and Farrar Straus & Young.
        Among the books he designed, Ms. Guilfoyle said, were the first 12 of the Little Golden Books for children in the 1940's with Crowell-Collier, ''Mr. President,'' a biographical study of Harry S. Truman in 1951 with Farrar Straus & Young, and ''The Lawless Decade'' in 1957 with Crown.
        Besides his daughter Ann, of Manhattan, he is survived by his wife, Veronica; another daughter, Mary Boyce of Ringwood, N.J.; six grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.
