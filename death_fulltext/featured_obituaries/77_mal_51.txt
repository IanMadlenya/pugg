        Arthur M. Bullowa, a Manhattan lawyer who was an art collector and patron of the arts, died on Tuesday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. He was 83.
        He had had a long illness, said David Praeger, the executor of his estate.
        Mr. Bullowa built one of the largest private collections of pre-Columbian art. From it, he donated more than 80 pieces to the Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1976 to 1993. The gifts ranged over all the major pre-Columbian cultures, including Mayan ceramics, Olmec jades and Peruvian textiles. Catalogues of Works
        In addition, the Metropolitan published catalogues for two separate exhibitions from his collections. These displayed funerary temples from Guerrero, Mexico, in 1987, and his collection of four-cornered Peruvian hats three years ago.
        Mr. Bullowa served on the Junior Council of the Museum of Modern Art and, later, was a vice president of the museum's Photography Committee.
        From 1967 to 1980, he was the president of the Aperture Foundation in Manhattan, which publishes a photography journal and photography books. He was its honorary chairman at the time of his death. The nonprofit foundation was formed in 1952 as a means of communication for photographers. Ansel Adams was a founder.
        Mr. Bullowa was born in Manhattan.  He graduated from Yale University, studied at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar and received his law degree from Columbia University in 1938. He worked briefly for a law firm before going into private practice on the East Side.
        Most of his clients were artists or people otherwise connected with the arts, or their estates, including the painters Fairfield Porter and Alice Neel and the photographer Josef Breitenbach. Mr. Bullowa had been in semi-retirement since last year.
