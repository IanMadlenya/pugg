        The Rev. Thomas Kirkland Thompson, an expert on church finances and fund raising, died last Friday at Doctors Hospital in Sarasota, Fla. He was 81 and a  former resident of White Plains and Tulsa, Okla., who retired to Sarasota last year.
        He suffered a cerebral hemorrhage, his family said.
        Mr. Thompson served the National Council of Churches in New York as executive director of its Department of Stewardship and Benevolence from 1951 to 1965. In that capacity, he tallied donations from members received by the affiliated Protestant and Eastern Orthodox churches.
        He issued annual reports, breaking down the amounts collected per capita by each denomination, and began the council's series of handbooks on financial stewardship arrangements that people may enter to benefit their church. He often lectured on the subject in Europe and South America.
        Mr. Thompson, who was born in Little Rock, Ark., graduated from Baylor University, Southern Baptist Seminary in Louisville, Ky., and Union Theological  Seminary. Pastoral duties then took him to the Tompkins Avenue Congregational Church in Brooklyn, Essex Community Church in Chicago and the Woodridge Congregational Church in Cranston, R.I., which he founded.
        After leaving office at the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the U.S.A., he became vice president for development at Wagner College on Staten Island.
        He subsequently took a similar position at the American Bible Society in New  York and, in semiretirement, served congregations in Paris, N.Y.; Southfield, Mass., and Craftsbury Common, Vt.
        Mr. Thompson is survived by his wife, Mildred Ladner Thompson; three daughters, Judith Planchon of Boston, Cynthia Thompson of Minneapolis, and Rosemary Glenn of Albuquerque, N.M.; two stepdaughters, Mary Robertson of Princeton, N.J., and Helen Ladner of Colorado Springs; a stepson, Edward Ladner  of Tulsa; a grandson and a stepgranddaughter.
