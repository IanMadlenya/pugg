        A. A. (Abe) Schechter, the first news director for NBC-TV and the first executive producer of the ''Today'' show, and his wife, Fritzi, died Wednesday in a car accident. He was 81 years old, and she was 82. They were residents of Palm Beach, Fla., and Westhampton, L.I.
        Mrs. Schechter was driving their car when it ran off a Long Island highway and hit a tree, the police said.
        Abel Alan Schechter was born in Central Falls, R.I. He was a reporter at The Providence (R.I.) Journal and The New York World before becoming an editor with The Associated Press in New York.
        In 1932, NBC hired him to organize and run the network's news department, which he did until 1942. In World War II he supervised radio and press communications for war correspondents.
        From 1945-50, he was a vice president of the Mutual Broadcasting System, then worked briefly at the Crowell Collier Publishing Company. He then returned to NBC to help create the ''Today'' show.
        He left in 1952 to start a public relations company, A. A. Schechter Associates, which in 1973 was acquired by Hill & Knowlton.
        The Schechters are survived by two daughters.
        A memorial service will be held at 11 A.M. Thursday at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street.
