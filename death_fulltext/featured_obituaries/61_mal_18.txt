        John Haber, an opera director, teacher and Zen Buddhist monk, died last Wednesday at New York Hospital. He was 46 years old and lived at the Dai Bosatsu Zendo, a Zen monastery in Livingston Manor, N.Y.
        He died of AIDS, said his brother, James Haber of Wayland, Mass.
        Mr. Haber was the first drama coach for the Young Artists Development Program at the Metropolitan Opera, and the founder and artistic director of the Eastern Opera Theater of New York. He directed operas in regional houses across the country and, in 1982, produced and directed a version of Monteverdi's "Coronation of Poppea" using jazz and soul singers.
        A native of Pittsburgh, Mr. Haber studied at Carnegie-Mellon University and the University of Michigan. His brother is his only survivor.
