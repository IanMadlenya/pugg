        Ivan Allen 3d, a prominent Atlanta civic leader and the son of a former Mayor of Atlanta, died on Sunday at his home in neighboring Franklin, Ga. He was 53 years old.
        The coroner's office of Heard County, Ga., where Mr. Allen lived on his farm, said the cause of death was a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
        Mr. Allen was president of the Ivan Allen Company, an office supply and furniture business founded by his father, Ivan Allen Jr., who was Mayor of Atlanta from 1962 to 1969.
        The younger Mr. Allen was a member of numerous community organizations, including the Woodruff Arts Center, the Atlanta Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America, the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce and the Carter Center of Emory University.
        Mr. Allen, a graduate of Princeton University, was closely associated with former President Jimmy Carter in the Atlanta Project, which has tried to address economic and social problems in that city. He was also centrally involved in the coalition that secured the 1996 Olympic Games for Atlanta.
        In addition to his father, Mr. Allen is survived by his mother, Louise Richardson Allen; his wife, the former Margaret Poer; two children, Ivan Allen 4th and Amanda I. Allen, and two brothers, Inman Allen and Beaumont Allen, all of Atlanta.
