        Shirley Garry Quill, a tenant organizer and the widow of the labor leader Michael J. Quill, died yesterday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 76 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She was suffering from an undetermined virus, a close friend said.
        Mrs. Quill was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Brooklyn College. She worked with Mr. Quill in the Transport Workers Union from its earliest days in the mid-1930's. She also managed his two successful campaigns for the City Council. He served two two-year terms in the Council, from 1937 to 1939 and from 1943 to 1945. He died in 1969.
        In later years, Mrs. Quill put together one of the city's more powerful tenants organizations in Lincoln Towers, a 4,000-apartment complex on the West Side of Manhattan. She was also active in women's causes and in local West Side politics.
        Mrs. Quill and Mr. Quill were married in 1961. Her three earlier marriages, to the composer and conductor Morton Gould, to James Garry and David Sternberg, ended in divorce.
        There are no immediate survivors.
