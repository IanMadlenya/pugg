       Ramon Durano, a former congressman, business leader and one of the country's most colorful politicians, died today of cancer, his family said. He was 82 years old. Mr. Durano virtually owned Danao, a city of 60,000 people north of Cebu. Many Danao residents were born in Mr. Durano's hospital, worked in his factories, retired to his home for the elderly, and were buried in his cemetery.
        Ramon Durano, a former congressman, business leader and one of the country's most colorful politicians, died today of cancer, his family said. He was 82 years old. Mr. Durano virtually owned Danao, a city of 60,000 people north of Cebu. Many Danao residents were born in Mr. Durano's hospital, worked in his factories, retired to his home for the elderly, and were buried in his cemetery.
        He was born on Dec. 24, 1905, to a prosperous Cebu family.
        He was elected to the House of Representatives from Cebu in 1949 and served until President Ferdinand E. Marcos abolished the legislature in 1972.
        In January, Mr. Durano was elected Mayor of Danao, defeating his son, Thaddaeus, in a bitter campaign.
        Mr. Durano was a longtime rival of the Osmena family, Cebu's other major political dynasty. Election battles between the two clans were often marked by violence and accusations of vote-buying on all sides.
        In his autobiography, Mr. Durano described himself as a political realist.
        ''I must say that like a determined boxer in the ring, a politician must know how to defend himself, know his opponent's weak and strong points and slug it out as expected of him,'' Mr. Durano said.
        During his term in Congress, he was involved in at least four fistfights with rivals on the House floor.
        He remained a devoted supporter of Mr. Marcos, describing him in his autobiography as the greatest leader the Philippines ever produced.
        He is survived by three daughters and two sons. His wife, Beatriz, died in 1981.
