        Julio Caro Baroja, a noted Basque anthropologist and historian whose many books on Spanish society, history and customs have become texts for generations of students, died on Friday in his home in Vera de Bidasoa in northern Spain. He was 80.
        Born on Nov. 13, 1914, in Madrid, Mr. Caro Baroja was the grandnephew of the novelist Pio Baroja and was acquainted with many of Spain's famous authors and intellectuals, including the poet and playwright Ramon Maria Valle Inclan and the philosopher Jose Ortega y Gasset.
        He studied philosophy and letters at the University of Madrid, specializing in ancient history. After World War II, Mr. Caro Baroja was granted a fellowship at the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research in Washington, where he met G. M. Foster and other American anthropologists. He then went on to study at Oxford University before returning to Spain in the 1950's.
        Mr. Caro Baroja became a professor in philosophical anthropology at the University of the Basque Country in northern Spain. He became famous outside academic circles for his authoritative and lively works on witchcraft, the Spanish Inquisition and Jewish and Moorish history in Spain.
        He is survived by a brother, Pio.
