        Max Falk, a former chief advertising executive of The New York Times, died on Friday at his home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He was 91.
        While Mr. Falk was the senior advertising executive, with the title of advertising director, advertising revenues of The Times grew to a record $175 million in 1972 from $129 million in 1966.
        When he retired in 1973, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the chairman of The New York Times Company, who was also the publisher of The Times then, said, "Max Falk has played a key role in our top management during an important period for  The Times, and under his able direction, advertising revenues grew to the highest level in our history."
        Mr. Falk was born and raised in Manhattan, went to Morris High School and won a Golden Gloves medal as a featherweight boxer. After high school, he worked for the old Van Patten advertising agency and attended New York University and Columbia as a part-time student.
        In the 1920's, he worked briefly for The Times as a salesman for business page advertising and then worked at The New York Herald Tribune for a time. In 1935, he rejoined The Times, as a real estate advertising manager.
        He went on to become classified display advertising manager in 1937, national advertising manager in 1939 and advertising manager in 1960.
        In 1966, after becoming advertising director, he headed a staff of 335 people in New York and in branch offices throughout the United States and abroad.
        Mr. Falk's wife of 52 years, the former Bess Abes, died in 1986.
        He is survived by two sons, Dr. George A. Falk of Manhattan and Stuart Falk of San Francisco, who is also a former national advertising manager of The Times and is currently an international marketing management consultant.
