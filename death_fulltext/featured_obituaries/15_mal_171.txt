        Mr. Whitcomb did thousands of illustrations for stories, advertisements and magazine covers for publications like Cosmopolitan, Collier's and McCall's from the 1930's to the 1960's. Mr. Whitcomb, who was best known for his drawings of glamorous young women, served as an artist for the Navy during World War II and helped found Famous Artists Schools, an art-correspondence school. He wrote a regular column for Cosmopolitan, a 1962 book, ''All About Girls,'' and two children's books.
        Mr. Whitcomb is survived by two sisters, Carolyn Schwenkmeyer of Cincinnati and Florence Ebersold of Chicago.
