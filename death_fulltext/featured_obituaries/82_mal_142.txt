        Josef Stroder, a pediatrician who saved the lives of Jewish and Polish children in World War II, died on Nov. 22 in Wurzburg, Germany. He was 81 and lived in Wurzburg.
        The cause was liver cancer, said Dr. Heinz Eichenwald, who co-edited a textbook, "Pediatric Therapy," with Dr. Stroder.
        In 1943, while serving as a physician in the German Air Force, Dr. Stroder was assigned as director of the Children's Hospital at the University of Cracow, in occupied Poland. He was ordered by German officers to deny medical treatment to Jewish and Polish children, and to refuse Polish doctors any opportunity to work. Secret Effort to Save Children
        Dr. Stroder ignored the orders and with the help of Polish doctors began a secret effort to care for all of the sick children, frequently hiding his patients' backgrounds from German officials. He developed a relationship with the Polish underground and helped the resistance movement to spirit out some patients who were being sought by the Gestapo.
        The effort was discovered near the war's end, and the Gestapo arrested Dr. Stroder, but his life was saved by the collapse of Nazi Germany. His experiences were described in his 1985 book, "Angeklagt Wegen Polenfreundschaft" ("Accused of Being a Friend of the Poles"), published by Herder Publishers.
        In 1948 Dr. Stroder was named chairman of the pediatrics department at the University of Wurzburg and director of its children's hospital.
        Before retiring in 1981, Dr. Stroder received a number of awards for his work during the war. In 1976 he was presented with the Gold Cross of the Republic of Poland, the country's highest honor. In 1978 he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Cracow, and the French Government awarded him "L'Ordre des Palmes Academiques," a recognition for academic and humanitarian achievement.
        Dr. Stroder is survived by his wife, Luise, two daughters and three grandchildren.
