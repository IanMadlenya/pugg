        Mr. Frese, who was born in Brooklyn, joined Grace National Bank in 1932, a year after his graduation from Gettysburg College. He rose to vice president in charge of the credit department. When Grace National merged with Marine Midland, he continued as a vice president.
        He retired from Marine Midland in 1973. From then until 1981 Mr. Frese worked as a consultant, first to the United States Small Business Administration and then to the J. Henry Schroeder Bank in Manhattan.
        His first wife, Sylvana, died in 1956. He is survived by his second wife, Peggy; three sons, Edward Jr. of Manhattan, Charles of Raquette Lake, N.Y., and William of Briarcliff Manor; two daughters, Victoria Frese of Boston, and Anne Chant of Nashua, N.H., and a grandson.
