        Philip E. Kraus, an educator and author who was an expert on gifted children, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 87.
        He had suffered from Alzheimer's disease for several years, said a daughter, Lucy Kraus.
        From 1963 to 1976, he was a professor of education at Hunter College, where he also was the coordinator of the Hunter College Campus Schools. He became a professor emeritus in 1976.
        In the early 1960's, he was director of the gifted child project at the New York City Board of Education. He wrote "Yesterday's Child" (John Wiley & Sons, 1973), a study of 165 children from different racial, cultural and ethnic backgrounds that traced their progress from kindergarten to adulthood.
        He also established the education department at Touro College, retiring in 1991.
        Born in Manhattan, he received an undergraduate degree from City College in 1928, a master's degree from Columbia University Teachers College in 1931 and a Ph. D. in educational psychology from New York University in 1943.
        Besides his daughter Lucy, of Manhattan, he is survived by his wife of 61 years, Martha H.; a son, Robert, of Rush, N.Y.; another daughter, Alice, of Manhattan, and a grandchild.
