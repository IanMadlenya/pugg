        William Jennings Dyess, a former Foreign Service officer and specialist in European affairs who retired in 1983 as Ambassador to the Netherlands, died last Saturday of cancer at his home in Washington. He was 66.
        A native of Troy, Ala., Mr. Dyess graduated from the University of Alabama, where he also earned a master's degree in political science. He did postgraduate work at Oxford University and Syracuse University.
        He joined the Foreign Service in 1958 and served as a political officer in Belgrade, Copenhagen and Moscow before a stint as chief of liaison at the United States Mission in Berlin from 1968 to 1970.
        Later assignments were with the department's Bureau of European Affairs in Washington. He was a press spokesman and briefing officer until the Reagan Administration posted him to The Hague in 1981. Since his retirement from the State Department he has worked in Washington as a consultant for various industries.
        Mr. Dyess is survived by a son, Chandler Dyess of Washington. He and his wife, Mary Elizabeth Awad, were separated.
