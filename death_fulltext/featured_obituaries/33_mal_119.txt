        Talbot Rantoul, a carpet designer and former president of the Rhode Island School of Design, died Monday at a nursing home in Providence, R.I. He was 77 years old and lived in Chilmark, Mass., and Ojai, Calif.
        He had been in a coma since last spring, when he was injured in a fall.
        Mr. Rantoul, a native of Ipswich, Mass., had had a long, award-winning career as a carpet designer before becoming president of the design school in Providence, which he headed from 1969 to 1975.
        In this period he was instrumental in the restoration of the Woods-Gerry House, an Italian Renaissance mansion in Providence that has since been declared an historic landmark.
        Mr. Rantoul graduated from Harvard College in 1936 and completed an advanced management program at Harvard Business School in 1947. Earlier in his career, he was director of design, merchandising and sales for the Roxbury Carpet Company in Saxonville, Mass.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Claire Angert; two daughters, Diana Harrison of Portsmouth, R.I., and Beverly Turman of Berkeley, Calif.; a son, Talbot Neal Rantoul of Cambridge, Mass., and five grandchildren.
