        The Rev. Gerard M. Mahoney, former chairman of St. John's University and former president of Niagara University, died on Wednesday at the Vincentian Seminary in Princeton, N.J. He was 57 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, a St. John's spokeswoman said.
        Father Mahoney was a member of the St. John's board for 17 years, from 1973 to 1990. He was chairman for the last nine years.
        He was president of Niagara from 1976 to 1981. Last year he completed a term as provincial superior of the Congregation of the Mission of Vincentian Fathers and Brothers. At his death he was president of St. Joseph's Preparatory Seminary in Princeton.
        In 1974 he was elected to the Vincentian General Assembly in Rome.
        Father Mahoney was former chairman of the Western New York Consortium of Higher Education and of the Niagara chapter of the National Conference of Christians and Jews. He was also a director of the American Red Cross in Niagara Falls.
        He was born in Brooklyn and was educated at St. Vincent's Seminary of the Vincentian Fathers in Philadephia before graduating from Mary Immaculate Seminary in Northampton, Pa. He was ordained in 1961, and received three graduate degrees from the School of Canon Law at Catholic University in Washington.
        He is survived by a sister, Mary Ann Walsh of Woodhaven, Queens.
