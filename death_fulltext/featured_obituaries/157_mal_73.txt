        Isidore Dollinger, a former congressman from the Bronx who was also a state legislator, a district attorney and a judge, died Jan. 30 in a hospital in White Plains, where he had lived for the last several years. He was 96.
        A Democrat, Mr. Dollinger was a member of the House of Representatives from 1949 to 1959, representing the 23rd Congressional District. The district takes in West Farms, Crotona, Hunts Point and part of Morrisania, polyglot neighborhoods in the Bronx that were then largely poor and Jewish, with a smattering of Puerto Ricans, blacks and Italians.
        As a congressman, Mr. Dollinger was considered unswervingly liberal. He was also known for his devotion to constituent service and his ability to perform in what was then called melting-pot politics, said his son, Edmund.
        He was also known for defeating Leo Isacson, a member of the American Labor Party, who held the congressional seat for a few months after a surprising victory in a special election in 1948.
        Mr. Dollinger was born in Manhattan on Nov. 13, 1903, and graduated from New York University and New York Law School. In the State Legislature, he represented the Fourth Assembly District in the Bronx from 1937 to 1944 and the 26th District in the Bronx in the State Senate from 1945 to 1948. He lived most of his life in Manhattan, where he had a law office, and in the Bronx.
        In 1960, Mr. Dollinger was elected district attorney in the Bronx. In 1968, he was elected to the State Supreme Court for the First Judicial District in the Bronx and Manhattan, where served until 1975, when he retired.
        His wife, Rose, died in 1994. Besides his son, who lives in Cliffside Park, N.J., Mr. Dollinger is survived by two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
