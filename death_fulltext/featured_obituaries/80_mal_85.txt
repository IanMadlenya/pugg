        Edward Baquet Sr., founder of Eddie's, one of New Orleans's most popular creole restaurants, died on Tuesday at University Hospital there. He was 71.
        The cause was leukemia, a disease he fought for a decade, family members said.
        Mr. Baquet opened the family-style restaurant in 1966 in Gentilly, a working-class neighborhood in the old part of New Orleans, and operated it with his wife, the former Myrtle Romano, and other family members, until 1984.
        He then turned over its direction to a son, Wayne, and his wife, Janet. They expanded the restaurant and added two others.
        Edward Baquet promoted the civil rights campaigns against segregated businesses in the early 1960's. When he was working at a restaurant called the Chicken Coop owned by his aunt and uncle, he allowed young demonstrators to eat and keep their placards there.
        After serving in the Army in the 1940's, he went to work for the Postal Service. He left to open his first restaurant.
        The New Orleans chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People honored him with its annual award in 1991 for his support of the civil rights movement.
        Besides his wife and son Wayne, he is survived by four other sons, Edward Jr., of Houston, Terry and Rudy, both of New Orleans, and Dean, of New York City, a reporter and editor at The New York Times.
