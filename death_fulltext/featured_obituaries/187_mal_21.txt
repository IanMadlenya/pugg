        Cortlandt Parker, president and publisher of the Recorder Publishing Company in Bernardsville, N. J., died on Monday at Norwood Caritas Hospital in Norwood, Mass.
        He was 80 and lived in Portsmouth, R. I., and Boston.
        The cause was complications from cancer, the company said.
        The company publishes 17 weekly newspapers in Hunterdon, Morris, Somerset and Essex Counties in New Jersey.
        Mr. Parker, who began his journalism career as an editorial assistant at The New York Sun, started his company in 1955, when he and his wife, Nancy, founded The Morris Observer in Morris Township.
        They went on to buy other newspapers, including The Bernardsville News, and other newspaper companies.
        Among their acquisitions was the 1991 purchase of the Eagle-Courier group in New Jersey.
        As a newspaper owner and editor, Mr. Parker was particularly proud of his positions on social issues, refusing to accept cigarette advertising before it was common to do so.
        In 1982, Mr. Parker and his wife nurtured another interest when they started Greenvale Vineyards in Portsmouth, R.I.
        They became co-publishers of several newspapers about the wine industry in the Finger Lakes region of New York and in New England, Long Island and Virginia.
        Mr. Parker is survived by his wife; two daughters, Elizabeth K. Parker of Millington, N.J., and Nancy Gray Parker Wilson of Boston; two sons, Cortlandt Jr. of Pohatcong, N.J., and Stephen Ward of Bernardsville, N.J.; and 14 grandchildren.
