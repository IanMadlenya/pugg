        Seymour Propp, former president of the Quincy Mining Company, a copper mining and exploration business based in Hancock, Mich., died on Tuesday at Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 76 and lived in Manhattan.
        His family said he had had a long illness.
        He joined the board of directors of Quincy Mining in 1946 and served as vice president and treasurer from 1949 to 1976. He became Quincy's president in 1977, shortly after the death of its president, W. Parsons Todd.
        Under Mr. Propp's leadership, the company diversified into real estate and securities, seeing it through the downturn in the company's core-mining business after World War II. Management Buyout
        In 1982, the company went private after a buyout led by its management. That year, Mr. Propp was a founding shareholder of Peninsula Copper Industries of Hubbell, Mich., a leading supplier of cupric oxide. Quincy Mining was dissolved in 1986.
        As a private investor, Mr. Propp backed numerous Broadway musicals and dramas, including "Gypsy" and "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"
        He was active in Jewish causes, including founding the Propp School, an elementary school for immigrant children in Israel. He was director of the W. Parsons Todd Foundation, which operates Macculloch Hall Historical Museum in Morristown, N.J., a collection of most of the work of the political cartoonist Thomas Nast. He also directed the Propp Foundation, created by his father, Morris, to support Jewish education and other Jewish causes.
        He is survived by his wife, Gabrielle; four sons, Douglas, Rodney, James and Amory, and two brothers, Mortimer and Ephraim, all of Manhattan.
