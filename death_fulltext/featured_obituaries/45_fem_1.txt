        Ruth Cheney Streeter, who commanded the Marine Corps Women's Reserve in World War II, died on Sunday at her home in Morristown, N.J., two days before her 95th birthday.
        She died of congestive heart failure, her son Thomas said.
        Mrs. Streeter, an energetic civic volunteer before and after the war, earned a commercial pilot's license in 1942 at the age of 46. The next year, she was appointed to head the women Marines.
        She retired from the Marines as a colonel at the end of the war and was awarded the Legion of Merit.
        When the women Marines were formed, they joined other female reserve service arms like the WAVES, for the Navy, and the WACs, for the Army.
        Their total enrollment was 250,000, of which the women Marines constituted 23,000 by the war's end. The men in service numbered 12 million.
        Mrs. Streeter, who was born in Brookline, Mass., moved to Morristown in 1922. She attended Bryn Mawr College for two years.
        Among the organizations in which she was active before the war were the New Jersey State Relief Council, the New Jersey Commission on Interstate Cooperation, the New Jersey Board of Children's Guardians and the New Jersey State Historical Sites Council.
        After the war, she was a delegate to the New Jersey Constitutional Convention in 1947 and a member of the state's Veterans Service Council. She was a Republican Presidential elector in 1960. She also served with county and township organizations.
        Besides her son Thomas W., she is survived by two other sons, Frank S., of Manhattan, and Henry S., of Wenham, Mass.; a daughter, Lilian S. L. Chance, of Malvern, Pa.; 17 grandchildren, and 15 great-grandchildren.
