       Stanley Fafinski, former chief of the Army engineering division in the New York District of the Army Corps of Engineers, died on Friday at Somerset Hospital in New Jersey. He was 56 years old and lived in Basking Ridge, N.J., where he moved last year after having lived in Queens many years.
        Mr. Fafinski had a heart attack at a golf game, his daughter, Donna, said.
        Mr. Fafinski was a civilian employee of the Government from 1956 until retiring in 1988. He designed and oversaw the Army's largest peacetime construction project, at Fort Drum near Watertown, N.Y. Construction began in 1986 and ended this year. In 1986, Mr. Fafinsky was named New York Federal Executive of the Year.
        In 1988 he started working as chief engineer of the RBA Group, which designs bridges and highways. He recently became a vice president.
        Also surviving are his wife, the former Rosemary Scozzare, and and a son, Stephen, of Woods Hole, Mass.
