        Herman Buchman, a makeup artist who worked in film, theater, opera and television, died on Saturday at his home in Santa Fe, N.M. He was 75.
        The cause was cancer, said his daughter, Caitlin Kraft Buchman.
        Before his retirement some 10 years ago, Mr. Buchman was director of makeup  at the New York City Opera. Earlier in his career he was associate professor of  theater arts at the State University of New York at Purchase and taught makeup at Juilliard and at the original Theater Wing.
        His film credits include "12 Angry Men," "The Miracle Worker," "Panic in Needle Park" and "Long Day's Journey Into Night." He was the author of "Film and Television Makeup" and "Stage Makeup," both of which gained a wide professional  following.
        Mr. Buchman's marriage to the former Dian Dincin ended in divorce.
        In addition to his daughter, of Geneva, Los Angeles and New York City, he is  survived by two brothers, Harry, of Miami, and Irving, of Manhattan.
