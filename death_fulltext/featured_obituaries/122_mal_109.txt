        Joseph Frayman, an editor and reporter in the London bureau of The New York Times for nearly 40 years, died on March 1 at Chase Farm Hospital in London. He was 85.
        Mr. Frayman joined the Times London office in 1935 as an editor and stenographer, advanced to head the copy desk and in 1960 was named assistant to the bureau chief.
        He oversaw the flow of news reports from Europe and beyond through London to New York, and wrote news articles and features of human and literary interest.
        Before his retirement in 1976, all editing functions of the bureau had been shifted to New York, but he continued to contribute articles.
        Mr. Frayman, a native of Manchester, is survived by his wife of 57 years, Rosa; four daughters, Isobel Warrender of Amersham, England, and Marilyn Brummer, Jane Marciano and Barbara Constantino, all of London; a brother, William, and a sister, Claire Epstein, both of Manchester, and eight grandchildren.
