        Myron (Grim) Natwick, the animator who gave life to the cartoon character Betty Boop, a curvaceous flapper with a Kewpie doll face whose favorite refrain was ''Boop-boop-a-doop,'' died on Sunday at Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center. He was 100 years old. He died of complications from pneumonia, a hospital spokesman said. Mr. Natwick introduced the miniskirted Betty Boop in 1930. With help from the singer Helen Kane, who supplied her voice, Betty Boop soon became known for her coy salutation, ''Boop-boop-a-doop.''
        ''Although she was never vulgar or obscene, Betty was a suggestion you could spell in three letters: s-e-x,'' Mr. Natwick said in a recent interview. ''She was all girl.''
        Among the earliest animated figures, the Betty Boop character has had a recent resurgence, said Noel Blanc, who succeeded his father, Mel, as the voice of Bugs Bunny.
        ''Her popularity in the last five years has been amazing,'' he said. ''A cartoon character goes on forever with the happiness it brings to people.''
        Mr. Natwick is survived by a daughter and two grandsons.
