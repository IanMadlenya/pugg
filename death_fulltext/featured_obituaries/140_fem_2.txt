        Eloise O. Spaeth, an art collector and booster of American art in particular, died yesterday at her home in East Hampton, N.Y. She was 96.
        Over many years, Mrs. Spaeth and her husband, Otto L. Spaeth, an industrialist and a vice president of the Whitney Museum of American Art, put together a collection that concentrated on European and American art between the two world wars, including works by Picasso, Matisse, Alexander Calder, Edward Hopper, Georgia O'Keeffe, Stuart Davis and Charles Sheeler. Mr. Spaeth, who died in 1966, founded the Dayton Tool and Die Company, Metamold Aluminum of Cedurburg, Wis., and several other ventures.
        In the mid-1950's, the Spaeth collection was exhibited at several museums, including the Gallery of Fine Arts in Columbus, Ohio. Most of it has since been sold, and a few paintings were given to museums, most notably Hopper's ''Carolina Morning,'' which went to the Whitney.
        But it was as a volunteer that Mrs. Spaeth, who was born in Decatur, Ill., made her mark. She was active in the American Federation of Art, where she served as traveling exhibitions chairwoman, started a newsletter and sponsored a book on films about art. In 1952, she was deputy commissioner of the American Pavilion at the Venice Biennale.
        In the early 1960's, as a way to raise money for the Archives of American Art Mrs. Spaeth started organizing art junkets to sites around the world, a device since adopted by many museums. She also helped get the archives accepted as a bureau of the Smithsonian Institution, which later rewarded her work for the archives with the Henry Medal, its highest honor. At her death,  she was a board member emeritus of the Archives of American Art and the Guildhall of East Hampton, N.Y.
        She is survived by two children, Otto L. Spaeth Jr. of Rye, N.Y., and Mary Louise Koon of St. Louis; 16 grandchildren, and 15 great-grandchildren.
