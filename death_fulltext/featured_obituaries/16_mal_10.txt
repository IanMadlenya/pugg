        Carroll Righter, an astrologer to movie stars and a writer of a syndicated daily column for 166 newspapers around the world, died Saturday. He was 88 years old and lived in Hollywood.
        Mr. Righter died at the St. John's Medical Center two days after being admitted with cancer of the prostate, a hospital spokesman, Armen Markarian, said.
        A native of Philadelphia, Mr. Righter studied his astrological chart after a sports injury and found he had ''physical protection in the Southwest,'' he once said.
        Before moving west, he was introduced to the astrologer Evangeline Adams. ''She told me I had the perfect chart for becoming an astrologer,'' said Mr. Righter, who liked to be called the ''gregarious Aquarius.''
        He began doing charts for Hollywood notables in 1938 and became a columnist in 1950.
        Mr. Righter said he had warned Marlene Dietrich to avoid working on a studio set one day because she might get hurt. His advice was not heeded, he said, and she broke an ankle while reaching out to save a falling child.
        Word of the incident led other celebrities to his Hollywood doorstep. Among those who were said to have sought his advice were Arlene Dahl, Rhonda Fleming, Jane Withers, Joan Fontaine and Grace Kelly.
        A good friend and fellow astrologer, Thomas S. Pierson, will take over Mr. Righter's column.
