        Dr. Neumann was born in Vienna in 1911. In World War II he served with the New Zealand Government Public Health Service in Western Samoa, where, as one of only two physicians in the island group, he ministered to the medical and surgical needs of 70,000 Polynesians and ran a leprosy colony on the island of Apia.
        Arriving in the United States in 1946, Dr. Neumann combined a private practice as a family physician in Hewlett, L.I., with work as a medical researcher at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York City. A specialist in communicable diseases, particularly sexually transmitted diseases, he was a frequent lecturer and was the author of two books and numerous articles.
        Dr. Neumann is survived by his wife, Sylvia; a sister, Edith Berwald; two nephews, and a niece.
