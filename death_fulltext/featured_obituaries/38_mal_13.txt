        Alphonse F. D'Andrea, a retired social worker and an aide to former Congressman Mario Biaggi, died on Monday at a Connecticut nursing home. He was 75 years old and lived in Bayside, Queens.
        Mr. D'Andrea became an assistant to Congressman Biaggi in 1969 after retiring from the New York City Welfare Department, where he had worked for 37 years.
        A 1931 graduate of St. John's Law School, Mr. D'Andrea handled some legislative and community matters for the Congressman and also helped run fund-raisers. Congressman Biaggi resigned from office in 1988 following his convictions for extortion and accepting unlawful gratuities.
        Mr. D'Andrea also served as executive secretary of the national council of the Columbia Association, an organization of Italian-American civil servants.
        He is survived by his wife, Gloria.
