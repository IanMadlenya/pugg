        Thomas J. Hughes, a retired New York State Supreme Court justice, died on Wednesday at St. Joseph's Hospital in Yonkers. He was 79 years old and lived in the Riverdale section of the Bronx.
        He died of a heart attack, his family said.
        Justice Hughes, who was elected to the bench in 1969, was presiding justice of the Appellate Term for the First Department, covering Manhattan and the Bronx. He retired in 1989 but continued to serve as a judicial hearing officer until shortly before his death.

He is survived by a daughter, Monica Kennedy of Marlton, N.J.; six sons, Thomas Jr., of Manhattan, Edward, of Fair Lawn, N.J., Charles, of Gilmanton, N.H., John, of Westbury, L.I., and Stephen and James, both of the Bronx; two brothers, Raphael, of Hazlet, N.J., and William, of Mount Laurel, N.J., and 24 grandchildren.
