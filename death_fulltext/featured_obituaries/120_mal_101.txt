        Beverly Peer, the longtime bass player for Bobby Short, died on Jan. 16 at New York Hospital in Manhattan. He was 84 and lived in Mount Vernon, N.Y.
        The cause was cancer, said Christina Wyeth, Mr. Short's business manager.
        For more than three decades, Mr. Peer spent his evenings plucking the bass violin in nightclubs as Mr. Short, the singer and pianist, belted out his sophisticated repertory of standards.
        ''In all our years together, I don't think we've had rehearsals more than six or seven times,'' Mr. Peer said in an interview some years ago. ''He just comes in at night and sits down at the piano, and I follow him. Quite often, he plays things I've never heard before.''
        Mr. Peer grew up on West 137th Street in Hamilton Heights and studied piano, then as a teen-ager switched to the bass violin. In 1937 he  joined the Chick Webb Orchestra and played bass behind Ella Fitzgerald on all of her early hits. Later he worked with Sarah Vaughan and Lena Horne and for a short time with the symphony at Radio City Music Hall.
        He performed for more than 14 years at the Blue Angel, a Manhattan supper club, working with the pianists Ellis Larkins and Jimmy Lyons  and accompanying artists like Carol Burnett, Dorothy Loudon, Johnny Mathis and Barbra Streisand. It was there that he first met Mr. Short, for whom he became a regular bassist in 1962. But Mr. Short's major success did not develop until he moved into the Cafe Carlyle in 1968.
        ''I respect him as my employer,'' Mr. Peer said of Mr. Short. ''I'm kind of old-fashioned. I feel I have to respect the boss. We get together occasionally on social events. But I don't make the money that Bobby does, and I don't infringe on his privacy. I'm just an old Harlem boy who knows what to do all the time.''
        No immediate family members survive.
