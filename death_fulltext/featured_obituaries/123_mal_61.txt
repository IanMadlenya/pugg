        Bernard Norman Samers, a fund-raiser for Jewish philanthropies and former executive vice president of the American Committee for the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, died last Sunday at Stamford Hospital in Stamford, Conn. He was 63 and lived in Stamford.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        The Weizmann Institute in Rehovot, Israel, is one of the country's principal centers of scientific research and graduate studies. Mr. Samers ran the Institute's American Committee, based in New York City, from 1986 to 1995, when his illness prompted him to accept emeritus status.
        His tenure was a decade of innovation and growth for the organization, which added new branches in the United States and set records in fund-raising.
        Mr. Samers, a native of Queens, received two bachelor's degrees in 1956: one in physics from Queens College and one in industrial engineering from Columbia University. He also received an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School in 1958 and an advanced degree in industrial engineering from Columbia in 1968.
        He first pursued a career as a management consultant for industry and government, working for Dunlap & Associates, research consultants in Darien, Conn., from 1958 to 1966, and for Cooper & Company in Stamford from 1966 to 1982.
        In 1982, he became a professional fund-raiser, as vice president of the American Technion Society, a mainstay of the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa. He joined the American Committee for the Weizmann Institute four years later.
        Mr. Samers is survived by his wife of 38 years, Edith Rosenblum Samers; a daughter, Audrey Samers of Manhattan, and two sons, Michael, of Liverpool, England, and William, of Manhattan.
