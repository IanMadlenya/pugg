        Timothy Gordon, the founder of the S.R.O. Hotel Touring Players and an actor who took theater to shelters for the homeless in New York City, died on Monday at Concord Hospital in Concord, N.H. He was 71 years old and lived in Pembroke, N.H.
        The cause was pneumonia, said his sister, Teresa Heywood of Salem, N.H.
        Mr. Gordon worked for many years as an actor in television soap operas and on theatrical tours. He created the S.R.O. group in 1979, he said, to take to "people who have no magic, and actors have magic at their fingertips."
        Mr. Gordon and his group of actors took their plays into dimly lighted shelters and the lobbies and cellars of single-room-occupancy hotels. In seven years, he put together 33 productions, including works by Chekhov, Noel Coward and Tennessee Williams.
        Mr. Gordon was born in Lawrence, Mass., and studied acting in Boston under Stella Adler. He retired to Pembroke in February.
        He is survived by his sister.
