        Horst Sindermann, a powerful East German Communist official ousted in last year's pro-democracy revolt, has died, the official A.D.N. press agency said today. He was 74 years old.
        Mr. Sindermann died on Friday after suffering a heart attack, the agency quoted family members as saying.
        He was a member of the Politburo and president of the Communist-dominated Parliament until November, a month after demonstrations toppled four decades of Communist rule.
        Mr. Sindermann rose through the Communist Party ranks after spending a decade in prison for party activities under the Nazis. The son of a Dresden printer, he joined a Communist youth group and was jailed for eight months in 1933. He was convicted of treason in 1935 and was confined in Nazi camps until the end of World War II.
        After the Germanys were divided, Mr. Sindermann became editor of Communist Party papers and held regional party posts before being named to the Politburo in 1967. He became president of Parliament and a member of the former Council of State in 1976.
        The press agency gave no information on survivors or funeral plans.
