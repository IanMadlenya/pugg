        In addition to the boisterous and often risque ''Carry On'' films, like ''Carry On Sergeant,'' Mr. Williams was a star of British stage, television and radio.
        He developed a distinctive effeminate voice that became his trademark, and when he appeared on television his arching eyebrows, flaring nostrils and rolling eyes made him instantly recognizable.
        ''I like smutty old jokes,'' he once said. ''Honest vulgarity is the central tradition of English humor and uninhibitedness the essence of comedy.''
        Mr. Williams first discovered a gift for mimicry in school and later entertained troops in World War II.
        He said in his 1985 autobiography that he never wanted to play serious roles.
        ''Laughs are more important than tears,'' he said. ''There are plenty of people who can play serious roles but there are not many who can be funny.''
