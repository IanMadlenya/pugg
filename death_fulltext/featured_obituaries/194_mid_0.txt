        Sidney Lippman, the composer and songwriter who wrote the music for Nat King Cole's 1951 No. 1 hit ''Too Young,'' died on Tuesday at a nursing home in North Bergen, N.J. He was 89 and lived in Fort Lee, N.J.
        Cole's Capitol recording with Les Baxter's Orchestra was the top song on ''Your Hit Parade'' 12 times.
        The song's words were written by Sylvia Dee, a lyricist and longtime collaborator with Mr. Lippman. They got the idea for the song, he recounted in a 1992 interview, when she told him that her younger brother was getting married and she thought he was too young.
        ''As she said that,'' Mr. Lippman recalled, ''she looked at me and I looked at her and we both said, 'Title?' ''
        He teamed up with Buddy Kaye and Fred Wise to do the words and music for '' 'A' -- You're Adorable (The Alphabet Song),'' which also became a No. 1 hit, in 1949, as an RCA Victor recording with Perry Como and the Fontane Sisters.
        Mr. Lippman's other successful pop songs included the novelty ''Chickery Chick.''
        Sidney Lippman, also called Sid, was a native of Minneapolis and graduated from the University of Minnesota.
        During World War II he was a merchant seaman.
        He moved to Manhattan and studied musical composition for a year at the Juilliard School.
        He left no immediate survivors.
