        W. Benson Terry, a character actor who worked in theater and film, died on March 24 at St. Clare's Hospital and Health Center in Manhattan. He was 76 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Terry, who grew up in Cincinnati, had an earlier life as a professional boxer and a railroad switchman and union organizer in Chicago. He studied acting at Columbia College in Chicago and got his start on the boards in Chicago before moving to New York in 1966.
        He was seen in Off Broadway and Off Off Broadway productions and appeared to critical acclaim as Firs in Lucian Pintilie's radical remake of ''The Cherry Orchard'' at the Arena Stage in Washington 10 years ago. He made his last film appearance in ''Forrest Gump,'' playing the shrimper who sells his boat to the title character played by Tom Hanks.
        Mr. Terry is survived by two daughters, Diane and Jody Terry, both of Chicago; five sons, Michael, of San Francisco; William, of Chicago; Don, a correspondent for The New York Times in Los Angeles; Steven, of Germany, and Duncan, of Albany; a sister, Margaret Arrington of Cincinnati; seven grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
