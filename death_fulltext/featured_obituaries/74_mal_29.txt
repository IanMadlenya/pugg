        Jose F. Duval, an actor and singer, died last Saturday at Brotman Memorial Hospital in Culver City, Calif. He was 72 and lived in Los Angeles.
        The cause of death was heart failure, said his son, Rex, of New York City.
        Mr. Duval was a familiar face to television viewers as the original coffee planter Juan Valdez in commercials for Colombian coffee. His picture also appeared on coffee cans and in print ads for 10 years.
        Mr. Duval was born in Havana and came to the United States at the age of20 under the sponsorship of the Metropolitan Opera baritone and Broadway star Robert Weede. He began his career as an opera singer, appearing in a Met touring production of "Die Fledermaus," and moved into musical theater and film.
        He played the King in "The King and I" in six productions over the years and had lead roles in "Kismet," "South Pacific" and other musicals. He was also seen in several movies, including "The Cardinal" and, most recently, "The Mambo Kings."
        On television he was featured on the Ed Sullivan and Jack Paar shows and made appearances in many nightclubs around the world.
        Mr. Duval's marriage to Betty Jane Dunn ended in divorce.
        In addition to his son, he is survived by a daughter, Melissa Gray, and a grandson, Bryce, both of Grosse Pointe, Mich.
