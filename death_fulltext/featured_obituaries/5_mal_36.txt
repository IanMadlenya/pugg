        Nathan Rapoport, a sculptor best known for his Holocaust-related monuments and edifices, died Thursday of a heart attack in St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. He was 76 years old, and was a resident of Manhattan and Ramat Gan, Israel.
        Mr. Rapoport's 15-foot ''Liberation,'' a bronze memorial to the American soldiers who helped liberate Nazi concentration camps, was dedicated in Liberty State Park in May 1985. It shows a soldier carrying a death-camp victim to freedom.
        Last month, Mr. Rapoport's latest sculpture, ''Brotherhood of Man,'' was dedicated at the Magen David Adom Blood Center in Ramat Gan. For six months prior to its being moved to Israel, it stood in Dag Hammarskjold Plaza at the United Nations complex in Manhattan.
        Mr. Rapoport received the Herbert Adams Memorial Medal from the National Sculpture Society for his achievements in American sculpture. A Monument for Warsaw
        One of his early works, ''Warsaw Ghetto Uprising,'' was erected at the site in Warsaw where the uprising against the Nazis began. A replica of the monument stands at Yad Vashem, the Holocaust museum in Jerusalem.
        The sculptor was born in Warsaw, and spent most of World War II living and working in Russia. After the war he lived in Paris and Israel before coming to this country in 1959. He became a citizen in 1965.
        Mr. Rapoport, who was divorced, is survived by a daughter, Nina Volmark of Paris; two grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
        Funeral services will be held in Israel on Monday. A memorial service is to be held later in New York City.
