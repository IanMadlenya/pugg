        Bruce Curll, a former psychiatrist on the staff of St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center in Manhattan, died on Sunday at Brackenridge Hospital in Austin, Tex. He was 28 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Dr. Curll died of complications arising from AIDS, said a spokeswoman for the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, where Dr. Curll received his medical degree in 1989.
        A native of Philadelphia, Dr. Curll joined the staff of St. Vincent's as a resident in psychiatry in July 1989. In 1985, he graduated magna cum laude from Texas A & M University, where he was chosen a Presidential Scholar.
        His companion was Lawrence Smith.
        He is survived by his parents, Allan and Frances Curll of Austin; three sisters, Dr. Cynthia Brinson and Adrienne Milloy, both of Austin, and Dr. Madelyn Curll of Bainbridge Island, Wash., and a brother, Brian Curll of Maui, Hawaii.
