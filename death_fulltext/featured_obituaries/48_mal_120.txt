        Ahmet Adnan Saygun, one of Turkey's leading composers, died in Istanbul on Jan. 6. He was 84 years old.
        He died of natural causes, said Berki Dibek, counselor at the Turkish Embassy in Washington.
        In 1958, Mr. Saygun's oratorio, "Yunus Emre," was performed at a concert conducted by Leopold Stokowski at the United Nations. Yunus Emre was a 13th-century Turkish poet whose works inspired the oratorio's text. Mr. Saygun's classic Western compositions were often inspired by Turkish folklore, which he studied intently. In 1936, he accompanied Bela Bartok on a music-ethnological trip through Anatolia.
        Mr. Saygun wrote operas, symphonies and piano concertos. He was working on a fourth string quartet when he died. Beginning in 1964, he taught composition at the State Conservatory in Ankara, and since 1972 he taught at the Istanbul State Conservatory.
        The Turkish Embassy had no information on survivors.
