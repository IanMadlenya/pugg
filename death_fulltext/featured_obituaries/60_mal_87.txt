        Charlie Ventura, a tenor saxophone star of the big-band era, died on Friday at Greenwood Health Care Center in Pleasantville, N.J. He was 75 years old and lived in Atlantic City.
        He died of cancer of the lung, a family member said.
        Mr. Ventura is remembered as a jazz great of the 1940's, when he toured the country with Gene Krupa's band and later led his own small bop combo with Jackie Cain and Roy Kral.
        He also played with the bands of Stan Kenton, Charlie Parker, Lester Young and Count Basie. In the late 1950's and 1960's, he led the Charlie Ventura Band and played tenor saxophone on a number of Jackie Gleason's albums.
        "Hearing him now, one realizes that he is the last of the saxophonists who managed to be both keystones of the swing era and portents of things to come," the critic John S. Wilson wrote in The New York Times at the end of 1974. Mr. Wilson wrote that the graying saxophonist, who had joined the Teddy Wilson trio, still played with "the swagger and drive that made him a standout with the Krupa band."
        He is survived by two sons: Charles Jr., a clarinetist, of New Brunswick, N.J., and Anthony, a guitarist, of Wilmington, Del.; a daughter, Rita Lenderman of Ridgeway, Va.; three brothers, Benjamin of Miami, Anthony of Northport, Fla., and Ernest of Bakersfield, Calif.; four sisters, Rose Terlingo of Miami Beach, Eleanor Ierardi of Philadelphia, Carmella Rossi of Tuscon, Ariz., and Dolores Inverso of Swarthmore, Pa.; his stepmother, Elizabeth Ventura of Philadelphia, and seven grandchildren.
