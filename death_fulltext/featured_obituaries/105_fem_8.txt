        Eleanor Aller Slatkin, a cellist admired in her own right and as part of a celebrated musical family, died yesterday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 78.
        Ms. Aller was born in 1917 in New York. Her father, Gregory Aller, who was a cellist like his father, had immigrated from Russia. Ms. Aller performed in Carnegie Hall at the age of 12 and studied at the Juilliard School.
        She played from 1939 to 1968 in the Warner Brothers studio orchestra. She met her husband, Felix Slatkin, a conductor and violinist and the concertmaster of the 20th Century-Fox studio orchestra, at a young artists' competition in the Hollywood Bowl; Mr. Slatkin won.
        Their home, in Los Angeles, was a constant haunt of musicians and film stars ranging from Arnold Schoenberg and Igor Stravinsky to Danny Kaye and Frank Sinatra. And their children went on to musical careers as well: Leonard Slatkin, now in his final season as music director of the St. Louis Symphony and soon to become music director of the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington, and Frederick Zlotkin, a cellist in New York.
        Together, Felix Slatkin and Ms. Aller anchored the renowned Hollywood String Quartet throughout its existence, from 1947 to 1961. The group was valued as much for its promotion of 20th-century music as for its compelling performances of classic repertory, and its recordings from the early LP era are still regarded highly.
        "My first strong musical memory is of the Villa-Lobos Sixth Quartet, which my parents were rehearsing," Leonard Slatkin once said.
        Ms. Aller remained active professionally after the death of her husband, in 1963. She was chairwoman of the string department at DePaul University in Chicago from 1968 to 1970.
        She is survived by her sons and by two grandsons, Daniel Slatkin of Washington and Felix Zlotkin of New York.
