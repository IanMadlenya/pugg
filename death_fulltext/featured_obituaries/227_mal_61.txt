        Ted Tulchin, a businessman and theatrical producer, died on Monday at North Shore Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y. He was 79 and lived in Floral Park.
        His death was announced by the League of American Theaters and Producers. The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        Most recently Mr. Tulchin helped to produce the revival of Stephen Sondheim's musical drama ''Sweeney Todd'' that opened on Nov. 3 at the Eugene O'Neill Theater. Other Broadway offerings he helped to stage included ''Vincent in Brixton,'' a drama by Nicholas Wright seen in 2003, and two comedies, ''Fortune's Fool'' by Turgenev in 2002 and ''Taller Than a Dwarf'' by Elaine May in 2000.
        He was associated with productions at the Promenade Theater on Upper Broadway and, on London's West End, with a successful staging of ''Guys and Dolls.''
        Born Stanley Tulchin in Manhattan, he served in an Army investigations unit in Europe in World War II. He went into business dealing with war surplus goods before founding a commercial credit and collection agency that carried the family name.
        The company, now STA International, provides credit management and insurance, collections and accounts receivable, via subsidiaries and affiliates, throughout the Americas, as well as in Europe and Asia. Mr. Tulchin was also the founder and longtime chairman of Continental Bank in Garden City, N.Y.
        In addition to his wife of 53 years, Pat Reyburn Tulchin, he is survived by two sons, Jeffrey R. of Brussels and Steven C. of Floral Park; a daughter, Jill Tulchin, also of Floral Park; a brother, Norman, of Los Angeles; and three grandchildren.
