        John Murray Reynolds, a retired New York shipping executive, died on Tuesday at his retirement home in Deerfield Beach, Fla. He was 92.
        A native of New York City, he was a 1922 graduate in geology from Princeton University. He then went to work for the old Munson Line, spending a year in Cuba before moving to the company's New York office.
        He joined the Sword Steamship Line in 1933 as a vice president but resigned in 1940 to join the United States Navy. He spent six years on active duty, including three as an intelligence officer in London, and was discharged with the rank of commander.
        In 1946, Jack Reynolds, as he was known, entered the ship-brokerage business. He also started a long association as secretary of the Association of Ship Brokers and Agents and, in 1963, became the founding president and, later, secretary of the Society of Maritime Arbitrators.
        Mr. Reynolds is survived by a son, John Jr.; a daughter, Virginia; a stepdaughter, Helen MacNamara, and one grandchild.
