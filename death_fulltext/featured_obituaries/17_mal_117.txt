        John E. Nidecker, a White House aide in the administrations of Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford, and later a lay brother of the Episcopal Church, died of congestive heart failure Monday at Shady Grove Adventist Hospital in Rockville, Md., after a long bout with lung cancer. He was 75 years old and lived in Rockville.
        Mr. Nidecker triggered a major investigation of influence-peddling by South Korean officials in the 1970's. As the aide was returning from a Presidential mission to Seoul in 1974, a South Korean security officer handed him an envelope as a farewell gift. The incident occurred at a golf club.
        The envelope turned out to contain $10,000 in American currency. Mr. Nidecker turned it over to the American Embassy, which returned it to President Park Chung Hee. Two years later, a chain of other attempted bribes of American Government officials and members of Congress led to a Washington scandal.
        Mr. Nidecker, a native of Philadelphia, was with the Sun Oil Company for 13 years before he joined Cities Service Company in 1947. He was manager for business development when he joined the Nixon Administration in 1969 as a special assistant, continuing in that post under President Ford.
        In 1976 he became a lay member of the Episcopal Brotherhood of St. Gregory, serving in churches in the Washington area.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Jeanne Brodhead; two sons, Arnold, of Rosslyn, Pa., and Stephen, of Hyattsville, Md.; a brother, Arnold, of Devon, Pa., and three grandchildren.
