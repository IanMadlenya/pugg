        Joseph Holzka, a banker on Staten Island for more than 50 years and a former head of the United States Savings and Loan League, died on Jan. 17 in the King James Care Center in Navesink, N.J. He was 92 and had lived in Todt Hill, S.I.
        The cause was heart failure, said his daughter, Barbara Judge of Little Silver, N.J.
        Born in West Brighton, S.I., Mr. Holzka began his banking career with the Westerleigh Savings and Loan Association in 1923. He became vice president of the Port Richmond Cooperative Savings and Loan Association in 1936 and executive vice president when it merged to become Northfield Savings in 1938. He was named president in 1957 and board chairman in 1973. Two years later, he retired.
        In 1957-58, Mr. Holzka led his industry's national association of some 4,400 savings and loan institutions. Before that he was president of the Metropolitan League of Savings and Loan Associations and director of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York.
        He was also appointed to a 12-member task force formed by the Federal Home Loan Bank to examine problems in the nation's ailing thrift institutions.
        His wife of 56 years, Evelyn, died in 1982 and a son, Joseph J., in 1993.
        Besides his daughter, he is survived by two sisters, Margaret Perez of State College, Pa., and Grace Minto of Palm Harbor, Fla., six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.
