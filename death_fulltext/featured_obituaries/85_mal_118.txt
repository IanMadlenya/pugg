        Irving Levine, a retired judge of the Connecticut Superior Court, died on Feb. 15 at his home in Pompano Beach, Fla. He was 84 and also lived in Bridgeport, Conn.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his stepson, Kenneth J. Stuart of Manhattan.
        Judge Levine, a native of New Haven, graduated from Yale University and Boston University Law School. He was in private practice in Danbury, Conn., where he also was active in the Democratic Party. He was first appointed to the Danbury City Court in 1949.
        In 1961 he became a judge in the state's new Circuit Court system. He subsequently served on the Court of Common Pleas and Superior Court in Fairfield County, from which he retired about 10 years ago. He then became a state trial referee. At his death he was taking part in a program intended to help settle appeals pending in Superior Court.
        Judge Levine also is survived by his wife, Claire; another stepson, Richard of Dallas, and four grandchildren.
