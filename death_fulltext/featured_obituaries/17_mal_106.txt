        Rudolph Maximillian Montgelas, an advertising executive and former chairman of Ted Bates & Company, died of cancer yesterday at Stamford Hospital in Connecticut. He was 74 years old and lived in Darien, Conn.
        Mr. Montgelas joined Ted Bates & Company - recently renamed Backer Spielvogel Bates Inc. - in 1950. He was hired by the Manhattan agency to handle one of its major accounts, the Colgate-Palmolive Company, which accounted for about 25 percent of the agency's billings. He quickly rose to become a partner in 1953, a vice-president a few years later and president in 1959. In 1963, he brought in another major account to the firm, the Cunard shipping company.
        Mr. Montgelas was also a director of the Bergen Brunswig Corporation, the Los Angeles-based pharmaceutical company.
        He attended Yale University and was a member of Yale's varsity crew and of the Whiffenpoofs, the senior men's a cappella singing group, before graduating in 1937. His father, Count Adolf von Montgelas, was a career diplomat and served as the German Ambassador to Mexico in the early 1920's.
        Mr. Montgelas was born in Germany. After coming to the United States in his youth, he lived for a time in Grand Rapids, Mich.
        In 1937 he joined Buchanan & Company, an advertising agency, where he rose to become president. He left the agency to join the Bates agency.
        In World War II, Mr. Montgelas served in the Army as a public relations specialist.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Barbara Trowbridge; two daughters, Michele van der Kieft, of Darien, and Daphne Cochran, of New Canaan, Conn.; two sons, Rudolph, of Loch Haven, Pa., and Mark, of Darien; eight grandchildren, and a brother, Carl, of Grand Rapids.
