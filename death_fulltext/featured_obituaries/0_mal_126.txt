        Mr. Cassola died at his home in this central Italian village shortly after returning from the hospital where he had been treated.
        The author, born in Rome on March 17, 1917, wrote morethan 20 books. He was best known for his collection of short stories, ''The Felling of the Forest,'' and the novels ''Bebo's Girl'' and ''Fausta and Anna.''
        His writing was stripped of action and loaded with detail, and Mr. Cassola was viewed by some critics as pre-dating the French ''new novel.''
        Mr. Cassola's works often dealt with the effects of the Fascist era. His melancholy stories, frequently set in the Etruscan town of Volterra, reflect a sympathy for ordinary people.
