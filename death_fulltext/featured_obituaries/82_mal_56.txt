        Penrod Scofield, an illustrator and a muralist, died on Friday at St. Johns Hospital in Yonkers. He was 60.
        The cause was cancer, said his companion, Paul Kresh.
        Mr. Scofield studied at the Parsons School of Design and the Art Students League. In addition to his murals and paintings, he illustrated books and film strips for children and worked as an animator for Walt Disney. Among the books that feature his illustrations are "Your Own Word," a collection of stories for children, and "Monty, the Biography of a Marmalade Cat," by Derek Tangye. He illustrated stories and poems by a number of authors, including Philip Roth, Herbert Gold and Muriel Rukeyser.
        He is survived by Mr. Kresh.
