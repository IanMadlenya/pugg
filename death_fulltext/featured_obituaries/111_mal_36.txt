        Moye Wicks Freymann, who helped to develop more precise measurements in population studies as the director of the Carolina Population Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, died at UNC Hospitals in Chapel Hill on March 30. He was 70.
        The cause was prostate cancer, university officials said.
        Dr. Freymann, who lived in Chapel Hill, was a professor emeritus of health policy and administration. He joined the faculty of the university's School of Public Health in 1966 and retired last year.
        He was a founder of the population center, which opened in 1966 and draws faculty fellows from 17 departments in an interdisciplinary approach to research, training and work in the public sector.
        Before joining the faculty, Dr. Freymann spent nine years in New Delhi as the chief consultant to the Ford Foundation on health and population in India.
        He was born in Omaha, received a bachelor's degree from Yale University, a medical degree from Johns Hopkins University in 1948 and a doctorate in public health from Harvard University in 1960.
        He is survived by his wife, Katherine Cantwell Freymann; three sons, Dr. Douglas M., of San Francisco, John B., of Washington, and Gordon R., of Columbus, Ga., and two brothers, Dr. John G., of Avon, Conn., and Jarvis M., of  Scituate, Mass.
