        George E. Mylonas, an internationally recognized authority on Greek archeology and a longtime teacher at Washington University in St. Louis, died April 15 after suffering a heart attack in Athens, where he lived. He was 89 years old.
        At the time of his death, Dr. Mylonas was secretary general of the Archeological Society of Athens. A funeral service was held in Mycenae, where he had directed excavations beginning in the 1950's that resulted in his receiving in 1970 the Gold Medal of the Archaeological Institute of America. He was president of the institute from 1956 to 1960.
        A native of Smyrna, now Izmir, Turkey, Dr. Mylonas came to the United States in 1928 after receiving a bachelor's degree from the International College in Smyrna and a doctoral degree from the University of Athens, where he taught. He received a second doctoral degree from The Johns Hopkins University and joined the Washington University faculty in 1933. He became chairman of the department of art and archeology in 1938 and retired from the university in 1969.
        Dr. Mylonas led several excavating parties in the Middle East, uncovering numerous artifacts and filling in large gaps in the history of the Bronze Age and other periods.
        He was the author of several books, including ''Mycenae and the Mycenaen Age,'' published in 1966 by Princeton University Press.
        Among his many honors and awards was the Order of Commander of King George I, which was presented by King Paul of Greece in 1955.
        Surviving are his wife, Lella; three daughters, Daphne Marsch of Edwards, Calif., Nike Hale of New York City and Ione Shear of Princeton, N.J., and seven grandchildren.
