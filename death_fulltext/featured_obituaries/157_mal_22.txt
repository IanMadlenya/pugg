        David Levy, a television executive and producer who created ''The Addams Family'' series for ABC, died on Jan. 25 in Beverly Hills, Calif., where he lived. He was 87.
        After becoming vice president for programming at NBC in 1959, Mr. Levy helped to turn around the network with shows like ''Dr. Kildare'' and ''Bonanza.'' He also was instrumental in elevating Johnny Carson to host of ''The Tonight Show.''
        Mr. Levy left NBC in the early 1960's at the height of the Senate hearings on sex and violence on television, refusing to accept the blame for excesses he had rallied against.
        In 1997, during his 20-year tenure as the executive director of the Caucus of Producers-Writers-Directors, he helped to steer the organization into support for stricter ratings for sex, violence, nudity and language.
        After leaving NBC he produced ''The Addams Family,'' based on the characters created by the cartoonist Charles Addams, for ABC. He also  developed other series, including ''Sarge'' and ''The Pruitts of Southhampton,'' and assisted in the revival of ''Name That Tune.''
        A graduate of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, Mr. Levy began his career in radio before joining the Navy during World War II.
        After his discharge he joined the Young & Rubicam advertising agency and rose to vice president.
        He is survived by a son, Lance Lee of Pacific Palisades, Calif.; a daughter, Linda Gorman of Rolling Hills Estates, Calif.; a twin brother, Dr. Charles Lee of Wynnewood, Pa.; five grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.
