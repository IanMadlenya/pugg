        Louis C. Sudler, a Chicago businessman who helped to bring about the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's return to international renown in the late 1960's and 70's, died on Tuesday at his home in Chicago. He was 89 years old.
        Mr. Sudler had Alzheimer's disease, said his son, Louis C. Sudler Jr.
        Mr. Sudler, chairman emeritus of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra since 1977, played a substantial role in rescuing the symphony from the decline it had suffered after the tenure of Fritz Reiner ended in 1963.
        He hired John S. Edwards as the general manager of the symphony, and Mr. Edwards hired Georg Solti as its music director and Carlo Maria Giulini as the principal guest conductor of the symphony. He also served as the chairman of the symphony's parent body, the Orchestral Association, from 1966 to 1972.
        Mr. Sudler was born in Chicago. He graduated from Yale University in 1925 and, with his brother, Carroll, opened Sudler & Company Real Estate in 1927 and built it into one of Chicago's largest real estate concerns. The firm, now called Sudler Nagy, manages more than 10,000 condominiums and cooperatives.
        Mr. Sudler created awards for the performing arts at 15 colleges and universities, including his alma mater, where he also donated funds for a recital hall named in his honor, and he established the John Philip Sousa Foundation to reward members of school marching bands.
        In addition to his son, of Chicago, he is survived by his wife, Virginia; seven grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
