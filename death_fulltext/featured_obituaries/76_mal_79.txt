        Lieut. Col. Sir Eric Penn, a British Army hero in World War II who later organized ceremonial events for Queen Elizabeth II and her family, died May 10 in London. He was 77.
        Sir Eric had a heart ailment, said his wife, the former Prudence Stewart-Wilson.
        The officer, who was knighted in 1972, won the Military Cross for leading the nighttime capture of a German machine-gun position outside Rome.
        After retiring from the Army in 1960, he held the deceptively colorless titles of Assistant Comptroller and then Comptroller of the Lord Chamberlain's Office, until 1981. The office is an important part of the royal household.
        In those years, The Times of London said, Sir Eric's "greatest attributes were his organizational ability and producer's eye in planning and executing ceremonial occasions," from the weddings of Princess Margaret and Princess Anne to the funerals of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and Earl Mountbatten.
        Sir Eric's family was from Norfolk, in southeastern England. He was educated at Eton and Cambridge University and was partly raised by an uncle who was an adviser to King George VI.
        In addition to his wife, whom he married in 1947, Sir Eric is survived by two sons, David and Christopher; a daughter, Fiona Wemyss, and six grandchildren.
