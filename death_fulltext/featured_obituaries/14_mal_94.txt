        Paul McDonald Fye, who led the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution nearly 20 years, died Friday at his home in Falmouth, Mass. He was 75 years old.
        Dr. Fye served from 1958 to 1977 as director of the institution, a private, nonprofit organization on Cape Cod dedicated to marine science. He was president of its corporation from 1961 to 1986 and at his death was working at the Marine Policy Center, which he helped establish in 1971.
        Dr. Fye had a background in naval ordnance when the Woods Hole trustees chose him as the institution's director. Under his leadership the institution's operating budget grew from $2.5 million to $30 million, with much of the money coming from the Navy and other Government sources.
        He was born in Johnstown, Pa., graduated from Albright College in Reading, Pa., and received a doctorate in physical chemistry from Columbia. Dr. Fye was doing research on high explosives at the Carnegie Institute of Technology when he was called to Woods Hole in 1942 to study underwater explosives.
        In 1948 he moved to the Naval Ordnance Laboratory in Silver Spring, Md., to do similar research, and in 1956 became associate director for research. He also was an adviser to the Polaris submarine missile program.
        Dr. Fye is survived by his wife, the former Ruth Elizaboeth Heym; a son, Dr. Kenneth Fye of Boston; a daughter, Elizabeth Murphy of Norwood, Mass., and three step-grandchildren.
