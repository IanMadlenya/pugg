        Robert E. Walton, a retired deputy director of the Office of Information Technology at the Justice Department, died on Tuesday at the Potomac Valley Nursing Center in Rockville, Md. He was 67 and lived in Bethesda, Md.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.

In 1957 he joined the Civil Service Commission in Missouri as a regional administrative officer. After transferring to Washington in 1960, he became the commission's chief of Congressional liaison and then its chief examiner.
        He moved to the Justice Department in 1968 as director of personnel and training in the Bureau of Prisons. Later, he headed the bureau's management programs branch.
        At the bureau, he established nationwide automated information systems.
        Mr. Walton is survived by his wife, Alice; a son, Robert E. Jr., of Louisville, Ky.; two sisters, Donna Coop of Anoka, Minn., and Marlette Koehler of Minneapolis; a brother, Douglas, of Coon Rapids, Minn., and three grandchildren.
