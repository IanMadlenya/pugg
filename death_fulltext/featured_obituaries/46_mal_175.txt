        Ignacio Gallego, a veteran Communist leader who was exiled in the Soviet Union and France after the Spanish Civil War, died here today of heart disease. He was 76 years old.
        Mr. Gallego formed the pro-Soviet Communist Party of the Peoples of Spain after the mainstream Spanish Communist Party fragmented in the wake of an electoral rout in 1982. He merged the two last year.
        Mr. Gallego fought on the Republican side in the civil war, was put in a concentration camp in Algeria and made his way to the Soviet Union, where he lived until 1945.
