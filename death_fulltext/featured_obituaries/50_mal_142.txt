        Harold Steinberg, a real-estate developer and philanthropist, died on Thursday at New York Hospital. He was 77 years old and had homes in Scarsdale, Manhattan and Palm Beach, Fla.
        He died of heart failure, his son Michael, of Manhattan, said.
        For more than 50 years Mr. Steinberg was affiliated with the Downing Management Corporation, a real-estate company he took over just after the Depression. He served as president of the company and built hotels, apartments and office buildings in Manhattan, Westchester and Washington.
        In 1957, he built the first motel in Manhattan, the Skyline Motor Inn on 10th Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets. It was the first new hotel built in Manhattan since 1931. He was deeply involved in philanthropic causes in Manhattan and in Israel, including providing funds for a reading room at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center and for a center to study diabetes at New York Hospital.
        He is survived by another son, James, of Steamboat Springs, Colo.; a daughter, Carole Krumland of Scarsdale, a brother, Morris, of Purchase, N.Y., and four grandchildren. His companion was Virginia Krich.
