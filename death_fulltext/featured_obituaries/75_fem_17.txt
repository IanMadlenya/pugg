        Nancy Quinn, the artistic director of Young Playwrights, an award-winning program dedicated to developing the talents of young writers, died on Saturday at her home in Brooklyn. She was 46.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Sheri M. Goldhirsch, the managing director of Young Playwrights.
        Ms. Quinn was born in Salinas, Calif. She grew up in Larchmont, N.Y., and graduated from Finch College in Manhattan. She began her career as an assistant to the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Charles Gordone during the production of "No Place to Be Somebody" at the Public Theater.
        For the next 25 years, she worked with other young playwrights, first as coordinator of the National Playwrights Conference at the O'Neill Center in Waterford, Conn.,, then as associate producer at Arena Stage in Washington.
        Ms. Quinn joined Young Playwrights in 1987. As producing director, then artistic director, she oversaw the group's annual Young Playwrights Festival. Under her guidance, submissions for the Festival, which features the work of three to five young playwrights each year, have increased from 600 entries a year to almost 950 this year.
        Ms. Quinn also developed programs to reach into New York City's poorer neighborhoods. One, "Take a Grown-Up to the Theater," gives free tickets to students and lets them take an adult along. Another, the Young Playwrights Tour, takes plays to schools and youth centers throughout New York City.
        At her death, Ms. Quinn had been working with Helios Productions to develop a series of "Schoolbreak Specials" written by Young Playwrights Festival alumni for CBS television.
        She is survived by her husband, Paul King; her mother, Kathleen Quinn of Larchmont; a sister, Patricia Quinn of Los Angeles, and a brother, Michael, also of Los Angeles.
