        Fred Frank Springer-Miller, a former I.B.M. systems engineer who helped design the first fully computerized Olympic scoring system, for the 1964 Winter Games at Innsbruck, Austria, died on Saturday at his home in Greenville, S.C. He was 65.
        The cause of death was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Springer-Miller, who grew up in Pelham Manor, N.Y., and Stowe, Vt., was a member of the Dartmouth ski team and spent five years as editor of Ski Magazine in the 1950's.
        Mr. Springer-Miller also designed scoring systems for the Summer Games in Tokyo in 1964 and in Mexico City in 1968 as well as for other international events.
        He is survived by his wife, Glenn; three sons, Frank and John Holt of Stowe and Joseph Donnell of Gunma-Ken, Japan, and a sister, Madi Kraus of New York City.
