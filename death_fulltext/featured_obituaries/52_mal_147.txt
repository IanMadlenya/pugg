        Arthur L. Green, former director of the Connecticut Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities, died on Thursday in Atlanta on a business trip. He was 62 years old and lived in Manchester, Conn.
        Mr. Green died apparently of a heart attack, the commission said.
        He began work with the agency in 1960 as a complaint investigator. He was named director in 1966 and received many awards for his work in affirmative action and civil rights.
        But toward the end of his tenure, the agency was criticized for the slow pace of its handling of discrimination complaints.
        The Hartford Courant reported that its review of the agency showed that during a five-year period, fewer than 1 percent of the people who filed complaints received public hearings. The newspaper's articles prompted the state legislature to propose changes in the agency, and Mr. Green retired last June 6. He then joined a Washington-based human rights organization.
