        Donald Whyte, a violinist in the New York Philharmonic, died on Sunday at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. He was 68 and lived in Pleasantville, N.Y.
        The cause was complications after surgery, said Eric Latzky, a spokesman for the Philharmonic.
        Mr. Whyte was born in Rivers, Manitoba, in 1942, and began his violin studies with his father, Alexander Whyte. He continued his studies at the University of Saskatchewan and later as a student of Josef Gingold at Indiana University.
        Mr. Whyte was a member of the Cincinnati Symphony, the Montreal Symphony and the Pittsburgh Symphony before joining the New York Philharmonic in 1972. As a member of the orchestra, he was a representative at the International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians, an organization that monitors everything from compensation to performance conditions at the major orchestras. He was also a board member of the Music Assistance Fund, which provides support for young minority musicians.
        In addition to his work with the Philharmonic, Mr. Whyte played recitals with his wife, Noriko Kitamura, a pianist, and played chamber music with several ensembles.
        He is survived by his wife and a daughter, Lianne McKenzie of Calgary, Alberta.
        Correction:  September 15, 2000, Friday  An obituary yesterday about Donald Whyte, a violinist in the New York Philharmonic, misstated his age. He was 58, not 68.
