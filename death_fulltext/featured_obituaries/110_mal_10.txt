        Mike Blanchard, a longtime referee at the United States Open who bridged the  amateur and professional eras of tennis, died on Wednesday in Phoenix. He was 88.
        Blanchard was the Open referee from 1972 to 1982, except for 1976, when he was chairman of the tournament. After 1983, he had been referee emeritus.
        Blanchard set the standard for officiating when tennis was primarily an amateur sport. He officiated on the Virginia Slims and World Championship Tennis circuits. He was also a referee for the Federation, Davis and Wightman Cups.
