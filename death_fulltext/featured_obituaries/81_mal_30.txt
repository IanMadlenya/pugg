        Sol Kahn, a retired New York stockbroker, died on Monday at Scottsdale Memorial Hospital North in Scottsdale, Ariz. He was 90 and had moved from Manhattan to Scottsdale two years ago.
        He died after a brief illness, his family said.
        Mr. Kahn, born in Manhattan and raised in Brooklyn, delivered dresses as a teen-ager and later established his own dress-manufacturing business, Sol Kahn Company. He switched to the brokerage business in the 1950's and worked for the firm of Jessup & Lamont until he retired in 1991 at 88.
        He helped found the Forest Hills Jewish Community Center in the 1930's.
        Mr. Kahn is survived by two sons, Dr. Willard S., of Newton, Mass., and Aron J., of Minneapolis; a daughter, Marilyn K. Seplow of Scottsdale; two sisters, Pauline Fischer of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Esther Nathanson of Brooklyn; seven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
        Correction:  October 8, 1993, Friday
        Because of an editing error, an obituary yesterday about Sol Kahn, a retired New York stockbroker who died on Monday in Arizona, omitted part of his career. He worked for three brokerage houses -- Orvis Brothers, Neuburger Loeb and Evans & Company -- before joining Jessup & Lamont, from which he retired in 1991 at 88.
