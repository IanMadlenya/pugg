        David W. Denton, once the third-ranking prosecutor in the office of the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, died Monday. He was 57.
        The cause was brain cancer, said his wife, Judge Reena Raggi of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
        Mr. Denton was a federal prosecutor from 1977 to 1992. In 1987, Rudolph W. Giuliani, then the United States attorney, named Mr. Denton associate United States attorney, the third-highest position in the office.
        David William Denton was born on Feb. 12, 1949. He graduated from Stanford in 1972, and the University of Colorado Law School in 1975. After leaving federal service in 1992, Mr. Denton became director of investigations for Citibank.
        Besides his wife, of Brooklyn, he is survived by a son, David Jr.; a brother, Gordon, of Fort Worth, Tex.; and three sisters, Marge VanScyoc of Albuquerque; Carole France of Aurora, Calif.; and Phyllis Denton of Dillon, Mont.
