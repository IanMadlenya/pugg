        Philip Rhinelander, former head of general education at Harvard University and a former Stanford University dean, died of cancer last Friday at his campus home. He was 79 years old.
        Mr. Rhinelander, a philosopher who was the Olive H. Palmer Professor of Humanities emeritus at Stanford, came from Harvard to Stanford as dean of the School of Humanities and Sciences in 1956. He held that post for five years.
        He was known to thousands of students at Harvard and Stanford for his course on the problems of good and evil.
        One of his Stanford students, James Stockdale, who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam, credited Mr. Rhinelander's course with helping him survive his imprisonment.
        Mr. Rhinelander, who was born Jan. 1, 1908 in Cambridge, Mass., got a bachelor's degree in classics and philosophy and a doctorate in philosophy from Harvard.
        He taught at Harvard and eventually became the chairman of the Committee on General Education and director of general education.
        Mr. Rhinelander is survived by his wife, Virginia, two brothers, a son, three daughters and 13 grandchildren.
