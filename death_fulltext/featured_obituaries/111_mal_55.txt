        Martin R. Kaufman, a producer and the founder of the Kaufman Theater on West  42d Street in Manhattan, died on Thursday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. He  was 35.
        The cause was diabetes, his family said.
        The Kaufman Theater, at 534 West 42d Street, was an abandoned brownstone awaiting demolition when Mr. Kaufman bought it in the mid-1980's and brought it  back to life as the home of a 99-seat Art Deco theater he named after himself.
        The theater opened in February 1987 with a revival of the Cole Porter musical "Gay Divorcee," produced by Mr. Kaufman. Other productions followed, including "Carnal Knowledge," Jules Feiffer's play about the battle of the sexes, starring Judd Nelson, Jon Cryer and Justine Bateman; "The Other Side of Paradise," with Keir Dullea; Murray Schisgal's "Circus Life," and "In Persons," a theatrical reminiscence by Anne Jackson and Eli Wallach. Mr. Kaufman was also an associate  producer of the Broadway musical "Grand Hotel."
        He is survived by his parents, Myron and Joan Kaufman; a brother, Steven; a sister, Lois Kemp, and his grandmother, Birdie Kaufman.
