        Margot Wittkower, one of the first women to practice interior design in Europe and the widow of the art historian Rudolf Wittkower, died on July 3 at her home in Manhattan. She was 93.
        Mrs. Wittkower, whose original name was Margot Holzmann, was born in Berlin in 1902. After establishing herself as a designer in Berlin, she left for London with her husband in the 1930's. She continued her work there, specializing in apartment interiors and furniture design. The Wittkowers were especially drawn to neo-Palladian architecture, and she eventually became an authority on the subject.
        She also collaborated with her husband on a number of books and articles and was co-author, with him, of two books: "Born Under Saturn" (1963) and "The Divine Michelangelo" (1964).
        She is survived by a grandson and two great-grandchildren.
