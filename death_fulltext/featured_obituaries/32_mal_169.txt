        C. Wallace Floody, whose heroics in World War II in engineering a tunnel out of a German prisoner of war camp were featured in the movie ''The Great Escape,'' died on Monday after a long illness. He was 71 years old.
        A Royal Canadian Air Force officer, Mr. Floody used the mining experience he gained in Kirkland Lake, Ont., to engineer and dig the tunnel that led out of Stalag Luft 3. He designed the tunnel's lighting, ventilation and electrical systems.
        Of the 76 Allied officers who fled the camp on March 24, 1944, only 3 eventually made good their escape. At least 50 of those recaptured were executed.
        ''The Great Escape,'' shot in 1963 in Germany, starred Steve McQueen, James Garner, Charles Coburn, Charles Bronson, and Richard Attenborough in the Floody role. Mr. Floody was a technical adviser for the film.
        Survivors include his wife, Irene.
