        Dr. Anthony A. Lofaro, a vascular surgeon who taught surgery and anatomy, died on Jan. 10 at his home in Bronxville, N.Y. He was 79.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his daughter, Laura Lofaro of Manhattan.
        Dr. Lofaro, who set up a private practice in New York City in the 1940's, taught surgery and anatomy at the Flower Fifth Avenue Nursing and Medical College before it merged with the New York University Medical School.
        A former president of the Bronx Surgical Society, he was a brigadier general in the New York Old Guard, a special unit of the National Guard, and helped prepare medical programs for statewide emergencies.
        He graduated from City College in 1936 and received a master's degree from Columbia. He studied medicine at the University of Rome.
        In addition to his daughter, Dr. Lofaro is survived by his wife of 53 years, the former Gabriella Sargenti; a son, Dr. Sal Lofaro, of Gladwyne, Pa.; a second daughter, Katherine Firpo, of Penn Valley, Pa., and six grandchildren.
