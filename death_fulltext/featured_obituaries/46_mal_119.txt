        Gilbert Tilles, a prominent builder on Long Island and a contributor to the arts and Jewish causes, died on Wednesday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. He was 73 years old and lived in Kings Point, L.I.
        He had a heart attack while driving near his home, a spokesman for the Union of American Hebrew Congregations said.
        During the post-war housing boom in the early 1950's, Mr. Tilles and a co-developer, Irving Berger, built more than a dozen shopping centers on Long Island, including Levittown Center, a vast retail complex on 45 acres. In 1959 he became president of All-State Properties Inc., a realty group in Floral Park, L.I., but he resigned in 1961 to form the Tilles Development Corporation, which built offices and industrial parks in the New York metropolitan area.
        Mr. Tilles was a 1937 graduate of the University of Michigan. In 1985 he and his wife, Rose, contributed $1.25 million to build the 2,200-seat Tilles Center for the Performing Arts at the C.W. Post campus of Long Island University in Brookville, L.I.
        Mr. Tilles was honorary chairman of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, which represents 720 Reform synogoues in the United States and Canada. He also served as chairman of its endownment committee and as treasurer. He was a vice chairman of Long Island University and a member of the board of the Long Island Jewish Center.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Peter, of Roslyn, L.I., and Roger, of Manhasset; a daughter, Ellen Weil of San Diego, and four grandchildren.
