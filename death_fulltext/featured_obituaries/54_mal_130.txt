        Arthur Briggs, an American trumpeter who was one of Paris's most popular jazz musicians in the years between the two world wars, died on Monday in Chantilly, a suburb of Paris. He was 92 years old.
        He died of kidney failure, his family said.
        Mr. Briggs, who was born in Charleston, S.C., went to Europe in 1919 with Sidney Bechet and played with Will Marion Cook's Southern Syncopated Orchestra.
        Admired for his technical virtuosity and clear tone, he worked in the United States and Europe for 10 years before settling in Europe in 1931. He set up a band with Freddy Johnson before forming his own group.
        Imprisoned during the Nazi occupation of France, he organized a band again when the war ended. In the 1960's he taught music in Chantilly.
        He is survived by his wife and a daughter.
