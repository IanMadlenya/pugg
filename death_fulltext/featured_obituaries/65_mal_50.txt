        Craig Ellwood, an architect known for his minimal steel-and-glass designs, died on May 30 in Pergine Valdarno, Italy, where he lived. He was 70 years old.
        He apparently died of a heart attack, said his wife, Leslie.
        Although trained as an engineer, Mr. Ellwood became a leading architect in the United States, designing apartments and houses, churches, banks and factories. His style was linear and crisp, in the manner of Mies van der Rohe.
        He was born in Texas, and studied engineering at the University of California in Los Angeles. In the early 1950's, he and several colleagues designed the so-called case-study houses, which were meant to redefine the American home. Built of steel and glass, these were spacious houses oriented to the outdoors. His 1953 Courtyard Apartments in Hollywood won many awards, and his Hale House in Beverly Hills, Calif., was praised in the 1987 anthology "Contemporary Architects."
        In the 1960's, he turned his attention to commercial buildings and designed factories for Litton Systems and Xerox Data Systems, among other companies. Among his last buildings was the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, Calif.
        Mr. Ellwood gradually gave up architecture and turned to painting. He moved to Italy in the late 1970's and restored a 15th-century farmhouse, where he continued to paint large geometric canvases.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Caitlin.
