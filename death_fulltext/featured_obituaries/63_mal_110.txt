        Dewey Albert, the co-founder of Coney Island's Astroland amusement park and later the operator of its popular Cyclone roller coaster ride, died Wednesday in Miami, Fla.
        Mr. Albert was 84 years old. He lived in Brooklyn and had a winter home in Lauderhill, Fla. He died of cancer, a family spokesman said.
        In 1952, Mr. Albert and Nathan Handwerker of Nathan's hot dogs bought Feltman's Restaurant on Coney Island, and the restaurant became the site of Astroland. Mr. Albert and his son, Jerome, opened the amusement park in 1962, hoping to revive some of the excitement and activity of Coney Island's heyday.
        Astroland grew to encompass the majority of rides and shows at Coney Island. The Alberts took over the operation of the Cyclone in 1975. The family continues to run that ride as well as Astroland.
        Mr. Albert is survived by his wife of 60 years, Adeline; a daughter, Sheila Kahn of Miami, Fla.; a son, Jerome of Manhattan, and three grandsons.
