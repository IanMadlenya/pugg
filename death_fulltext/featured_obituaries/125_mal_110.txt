        Charles Kendall O'Neill, a writer of history, radio and television scripts and short stories, died on June 19 at his home in Green Farms, Conn. He was 87.
        Born in Bridgeport, Conn., Mr. O'Neill graduated from Dartmouth College and contributed stories to national magazines and scripts to radio networks in the 1930's. In World War II he served with the Office of Inter-American Affairs in Latin America and with the Seventh Army and the Office of Strategic Services in North Africa and Europe.

        At his death he was working on a history of Gen. William Nelson and the Kentucky Unionists of the Civil War. He had completed the manuscript and was making revisions, his family said.
