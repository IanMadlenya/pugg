        Dr. E. Richard Feinberg, a psychiatrist who specialized in treating delinquent and violent children, died on Monday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. He was 64 and lived in Mount Vernon, N.Y.
        The cause was stomach cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Feinberg was the director of the Bronx Children's Psychiatric Center from its beginning in 1969 until last year. He helped design the center and develop its programs, and oversaw the treatment of some 7,000 children.
        Previously, children with mental illness were housed with adults, often in the same wards. But backed by a groundswell of public support in the early 1960's, Dr. Feinberg and some of his peers persuaded Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller  to seek a change in that practice. The reason was that mentally ill children, particularly those with a history of violence, had to be offered special protection and treatment tailored to their ages and difficulties.
        At his death, Dr. Feinberg was director of child and adolescent psychiatry at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University, where he was also a professor of psychiatry and department vice chairman. Other affiliations were  Rutgers University, St. John's University, Jacobi Medical Center and Montefiore  Medical Center.
        He was a 1952 graduate of Johns Hopkins University and received his medical degree from Tufts University College of Medicine in 1956. He trained in psychiatry at Bronx Municipal Hospital Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine.
        He served on commissions and state task forces and often advised state agencies on mental illness in children and adolescents.
        Dr. Feinberg is survived by his wife of 35 years, Doris Strumer Feinberg; two sons, Dr. Michael Feinberg of Atlanta and Dr. Stephen Feinberg of Braintree, Mass.; his parents, Lillian and Abraham Feinberg of Manhattan; a sister, Dr. Judith Schneider Weissberg, also of Manhattan, and a grandson.
