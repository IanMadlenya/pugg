        Robert Emmet Curry, former president of Catholic Big Brothers of New York, died on Saturday at his son's home in Manhattan. He was 88 and lived on the Upper East Side.
        Mr. Curry was also a former president and chairman of a Manhattan-based insurance brokerage, the John F. Curry Agency, from which he retired in 1985.
        He was president of Catholic Big Brothers of New York from 1957 through 1959, and served on its board of directors from 1949 through 1982.
        The organization provides mentors for boys and girls from single-parent families in New York City. Girls were first included in 1985.
        Mr. Curry was also a founder and a director of what is now Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, a national organization started in 1946. It monitors local agencies with missions similar to Catholic Big Brothers of New York.
        He had also been chairman of the New York City Board of Correction.
        Born in Manhattan, he graduated from Georgetown and was in the Army for nine years, until 1946.
        He was predeceased by his wife, the former Rose Mooney.
        In addition to his son, Robert Emmet Jr., he is survived by a brother, Bernard F. Curry of Palm Beach, Fla., and two grandchildren.
