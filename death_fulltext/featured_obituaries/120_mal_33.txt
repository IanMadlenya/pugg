        Sandor Vegh, a violinist and conductor whose performances of Mozart, Bach and early 20th-century works were both elegant and deeply felt, died on Monday at a hospital in Freilassing, Germany, near Salzburg, Austria. He was 91 and lived in Salzburg.
        As the director of the Camerata Academica, an orchestra at the Salzburg Mozarteum, Mr. Vegh made numerous recordings, including a highly regarded traversal of the Mozart Piano Concertos with Andras Schiff, Haydn's ''Seven Last Words of Christ From the Cross'' and a 20th-century collection that included works by Bartok, Stravinsky and Berg.
        He also made many recordings with the Vegh Quartet, which he founded in 1940. During his 30 years with the ensemble, he toured regularly and recorded the complete quartet cycles of Beethoven and Bartok as well as many of the Haydn quartets.
        Musicians like Mr. Schiff and the cellist Ralph Kirshbaum, with whom Mr. Vegh collaborated in chamber concerts, often spoke of him as both an inspiring presence and a connection with a quickly vanishing style of personalized music-making.
        Mr. Vegh was born in 1905 in what is now Cluj-Napoca, Romania. He studied violin with Jeno Hubay and composition with Zoltan Kodaly at the Liszt Academy in Budapest. In the late 1920's and early 30's he toured Europe as a soloist, then suspended his solo career to form the Hungarian String Quartet in 1935. He left the group five years later to form the ensemble that bore his name.
        The Vegh Quartet was based in Budapest until 1946, when it left Hungary. Mr. Vegh settled in Switzerland and later in Salzburg, where he became director of the Camerata Academica in 1978.
        Mr. Vegh toured as a soloist, chamber player and conductor. He also held teaching positions in Switzerland, Germany and Austria.
        He is survived by his wife, a son and a daughter.
