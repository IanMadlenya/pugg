        Dr. Carroll Behrhorst, a physician who left Kansas 28 years ago to practice among the poverty-stricken Cakchiquel Indians of rural Guatemala, died yesterday in Chimaltenango, Guatemala, apparently of a heart attack. He was 67 years old.
        His death was announced by Tulane University Medical Center in New Orleans, where he held the position of adjunct assistant professor in the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine.
        Dr. Behrhorst, a native of Brazilton, Kan., moved his family to Chimaltenango in 1962 and founded the Behrhorst Clinic, a one-man, one-room operation. Since then, the foundation he set up has provided health care for 250,000 people and run training programs for Indians in health, agriculture and water supply.
        His work served as a model for rural health care as far away as Africa and the Far East. Many of those who knew him called him the Albert Schweitzer of the New World.
        He is survived by his wife, Alicia; their three children, Miguel, Daisey and Jessica of New Orleans; his daughters Carol Ann Maupin, Lisa Stiner and Elizabeth Behrhorst of Twin Falls, Idaho; his sons Christopher, Kurth and Gregory of Los Angeles; and two brothers, Vernon, of Lafayette, La., and the Rev. Wallace Behrhorst of St. Louis.
        Burial will be in Chimaltenango.
