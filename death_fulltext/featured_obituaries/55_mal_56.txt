        Larry Kane, an award-winning designer of men's fashions, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 61 years old.
        He died of a brain tumor, his wife, Helayne, said.
        Mr. Kane began his career as a child actor and as an assistant talent agent with MCA Inc. before serving in the Army in Korea.
        He joined Blacker Brothers, a sports coat manufacturer, in 1953 and learned the rudiments of the clothing business. When Stanley Blacker left the family business to establish his own company, Mr. Kane went with him as a salesman, designer and stylist.
        In 1969, he established Raffles Wear, a division of Kayser-Roth, where he could test his theory of color-, pattern- and design-related ready-to-wear coordinates. He designed sports coats, leisure suits, shirts, pants, sweaters and outerwear, and within six years the company had annual sales of about $8 million.
        In 1971, he won the Coty Award for fashion excellence. In 1974, he founded his own company, Larry Kane Inc., and designed clothing for a number of accounts, including the Puritan division of Warnaco and Haspel Brothers. He retired in 1977, when the brain tumor began to affect his work.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Teresa, of Manhattan; a son, Ivan, of North Hollywood, Calif., and a sister, Roberta Leibow of Engelwood, N.J.
