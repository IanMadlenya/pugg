        Robert Emmett Ginna, a champion of nuclear power who helped build some of the first nuclear generating plants in the United States, died on Wednesday at St. Ann's Home in Rochester after a long illness. He was 94.
        Mr. Ginna (pronounced gun-NAY) was a native of Brooklyn who became a longtime official of the Rochester Gas and Electric Corporation and served as its chief executive for a decade.
        In 1954, he helped persuade the Government to modify the Atomic Energy Act to permit research into using nuclear energy to generate electricity. He also played a role during the 1950's in creating the Power Reactor Development Company, which built an experimental breeder reactor in Monroe, Mich., that supplied electricity to the Detroit Edison Company. And he helped Rochester Gas  and Electric join with six other New York utilities to form Empire State Atomic  Development Associates, which engaged in further nuclear power research.
        Mr. Ginna, who had joined Rochester Gas and Electric in 1927, was named chairman and chief executive in 1957.
        Under his leadership, the company built a nuclear plant in the nearby town of Ontario, and Mr. Ginna, in a salute to his Irish roots, had it painted green. The plant, which the company's board later named for him, was recently refurbished with new turbines and has now been generating electricity since 1966. He retired in 1968.
        He is survived by a son, Robert Jr., of Jaffrey Center, N.H.; a daughter, Margretta Michie of Rochester; a sister, Mary Ginna of Brooklyn; seven grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren. His wife, the former Margaret McCall, died in 1975.
