        Robert J. Suslow, a retail executive who presided over Saks Fifth Avenue, Ohrbach's, Famous-Barr and Batus Retail during the 1970's and 1980's, died Sunday at his apartment in New York.
        He was 65. The cause of death was arteriosclerosis, according to his nephew, Steven Suslow.
        Mr. Suslow started his retailing career in 1951 as a trainee at Bloomingdale's, rising to executive positions there and later at G. Fox & Company in Hartford.
        In 1969, he became an executive vice president and general manager of Ohrbach's and later its president.
        He next moved to Famous-Barr stores in St. Louis as its president, in 1974.
        He became president of Saks Fifth Avenue in 1976 and the company's chief executive two years later.
        In 1979 he was named the president of the B.W.I. retail group of Brown & Williamson Industries, the predecessor company of Batus Retail Group, and in 1981 he became the chairman and chief executive of Batus, which was then the corporate owner of Saks Fifth Avenue, Gimbel Brothers and Marshall Field & Company. He resigned from that position in 1984.
        Later that year he joined Calvin Klein Industries as its president and held a 10 percent interest in the fashion designer's business.
        The following year he resigned that position at the age of 50 and shifted his attention from retail companies to his other passion: harness racing.
        Although he remained a retail consultant, his nephew said that horse racing became his hobby and his business, which he operated as RJS Stables.
        ''It was his life -- not just owning horses, but going to the track and training,'' said Steven Suslow, who noted that his uncle's most successful horse was Happy Escort, which won the Little Brown Jug harness race in the late 1970's.
        Mr. Suslow is also survived by his brother, Howard of West Palm Beach, Fla.
