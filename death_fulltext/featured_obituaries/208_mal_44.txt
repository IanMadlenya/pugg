        Samuel Iwry, an expert on Hebrew who helped prove the antiquity of the Dead Sea Scrolls, died in Baltimore on May 8, Johns Hopkins University announced. He was 93.
        A professor emeritus at Johns Hopkins, Dr. Iwry (pronounced EVE-ree) was a graduate student at the university when the scrolls were discovered in 1947.
        Working with his mentor, the biblical scholar William Foxwell Albright, he used his unusual knowledge of ancient, rabbinic and modern Hebrew -- and his familiarity with the Damascus Document, another Hebrew text found 50 years earlier -- to date the Dead Sea Scrolls to Roman times. While some scholars argued that the scrolls were medieval copies of ancient documents, carbon testing later validated Dr. Albright's and Dr. Iwry's hypothesis.
        ''Sam's knowledge of Hebrew of all periods was unsurpassed and was critical in proving the antiquity of the scrolls,'' said Dr. P. Kyle McCarter, the W. F. Albright professor of Near Eastern studies at Johns Hopkins.
        Samuel Iwry was born in 1910 in Bialystock, Russia, now Poland. The product of a traditional yeshiva education, he escaped to Lithuania after the Nazi invasion, later making his way to Kobe, Japan, and Shanghai. He immigrated to the United States in 1947, and taught at Johns Hopkins from 1951 until his retirement in 1991.
        He is survived by his wife of 58 years, Nina; his son, J. Mark, of Bethesda, Md.; and a grandson.
