        Dr. Massimo E. Calabresi, clinical professor emeritus of medicine at the Yale University School of Medicine, died Sunday at his home in New Haven after a long illness. He was 84 years old.
        A native of Ferrara, Italy, he was an early and active opponent of the Fascist movement. He was jailed by the Fascist Government in 1923 and later helped to circulate the leading underground newspaper of the resistance. He and his family sought refuge in the United States in 1939.
        Dr. Calabresi was appointed a research fellow in internal medicine at Yale in 1940. While on the faculty he received the degree of Doctor of Public Health from the university and in 1950 joined the Connecticut Health Department, for which he organized cardiological teaching clinics in hospitals.
        He returned to the Yale faculty full time in 1952 upon appointment as chief of cardiology at the West Haven Veterans Administration Hospital, where he remained until he retired in 1973, the same year he retired from Yale.
        His wife, the former Bianca Finzi-Contini, who for many years was a professor and chairman of the Italian department at Albertus Magnus College in New Haven, died in 1982.
        He is survived by two sons, Dr. Paul Calabresi of Barrington, R.I., chairman of the Department of Medicine at Brown University, and Guido Calabresi of Woodbridge, Conn., dean of the law school and Sterling Professor of Law at Yale; a sister, Renata Calabresi of Manhattan, and six grandchildren.
