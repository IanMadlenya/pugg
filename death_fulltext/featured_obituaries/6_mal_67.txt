        Dr. John H. Northrop, a 1946 Nobel laureate, died May 27 at his home in Wickenberg, Ariz. He was 95 years old.
        Dr. Northrop shared the Nobel prize in chemistry with a Rockefeller University colleague, Wendell F. Stanley, and James B. Summer of Cornell University for their work on the purification and crystallization of enzymes.
        Born in Yonkers, N.Y. in 1891, Dr. Northrop earned a B.S. degree from Columbia College in 1912. He then earned a M.A. in science in 1913 and a Ph.D in chemistry in 1915. During World War I, Dr. Northrop was commissioned a captain in the United States Army Chemical Warfare Service.
        He was a life member of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, now called Rockefeller University. He worked in the Institute's Princeton, N.J. laboratories and later served as a professor of bacteriology and biophysics at the University of California at Berkeley.
        Dr. Northrop was the author of a book, ''Crystalline Enzymes,'' and was a contributor to and editor of the Journal of General Physiology.
        He is survived by his daughter Alice N. Robbins of Shaker Heights, Ohio and his son John, of La Jolla, Calif.; five grand-children and one great-grand child. His son-in-law, Dr. Frederick C. Robbins, is also a Nobel laureate, in physiology and medicine, which he won in 1954. Dr. Robbins is now dean emeritus at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine.
