        Mr. Agusta died in St. Moritz, the company said. The cause of death was not announced.
        Mr. Agusta, who was involved in the manufacture of motorcycles early in his career, took over the family business in 1971 on the death of his brother.
        He increased the company's sales of military helicopters, particularly to Iran as a result of his friendship with the Shah, Mohammed Riza Pahlevi.
        The company gradually came under control of an Italian state holding company, and Mr. Agusta gave up the chairmanship in 1984.
        No survivors were listed.
