        Mario Delamo, who performed with the Martha Graham Dance Company in the 1970's, died on May 13 in Los Angeles. He was 55 and lived in West Hollywood.
        The cause was hepatitis and liver failure, said Diana Rodriguez, his sister.
        Born in Havana, Mr. Delamo came to the United States as a child. He trained in New York City with teachers who included Gertrude Shurr and May O'Donnell, early Graham dancers; and Norman Walker, with whom he performed. He also worked with Helen Tamiris and Ted Shawn.
        Mr. Delamo performed with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater from 1970 to 1972, when he joined the Graham troupe. Graham choreographed the central duet in ''Ecuatorial,'' a 1978 dance inspired by Mayan fertility prayers, for Mr. Delamo and Yuriko Kimura, his frequent partner. The same year, Mr. Delamo, a dancer admired for the purity of his Graham technique, brought extra dramatic nuance to the role of the young Aegisthus in Graham's ''Clytemnestra'' and the role of Tiresias in her ''Night Journey.''
        His other lead roles in the Graham repertory included St. Michael in ''Seraphic Dialogue,'' the Penitent in ''El Penitente'' and Jason in ''Cave of the Heart.''
        Graham chose Mr. Delamo to coach guest artists, among them Rudolf Nureyev in the 1975 ''Lucifer'' and Liza Minnelli in the 1978 ''Owl and the Pussycat.'' She also sent him to Israel to restage her ''Circe'' for the Bat-Dor Dance Company in the mid-1970's.
        Mr. Delamo left the Graham group in 1978. He owned and ran a glassware boutique in West Hollywood until 1992. He was recently invited by the Martha Graham Trust to help teach and restage Graham's dances.
        In addition to Ms. Rodriguez, of Culver City, Calif., Mr. Delamo is survived by his mother, Moraima Vazquez, also of Culver City, and a sister, Daisy Delamo of Havana.
