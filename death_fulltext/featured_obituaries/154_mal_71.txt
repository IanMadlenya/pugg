        David Shaber, a producer and writer for the screen and stage, died on Nov. 4 at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 70 and had homes in Manhattan and Roxbury, Conn.
        The cause was an aneurysm, said his wife, Alice.
        Mr. Shaber wrote 40 commissioned screenplays, 8 of which were made into full-length feature films, among them ''Nighthawks'' (1981), with Sylvester Stallone, and ''Rollover'' (1981), with Jane Fonda. Another of his screenplays, for ''Those Lips, Those Eyes'' (1980), with Frank Langella and Thomas Hulce, about an Ohio summer stock company, was a thinly veiled account of Mr. Shaber's youthful fascination with events both onstage and off.
        Like the main character, Mr. Shaber grew up in Cleveland and spent two summers working as a prop man in local theater productions while he was a pre-med student  at Case-Western Reserve University. But his obsession with the theater prompted him to abandon his course, and he headed off to the Yale School of Drama.
        He was also a producer of the 1962 Broadway run of ''A Gift of Time,'' directed by Garson Kanin and starring Henry Fonda and Olivia de Havilland, and an Off Broadway production of Noel Coward's ''Conservation Piece.'' He was also the author of several plays, including ''Bunker Reveries'' in 1987.
        At the time of his death, he was working on the book for a new musical based on the Theodore Dreiser novel ''An American Tragedy,'' with the composer and lyricist team of Charles Strouse and Lee Adams.
        For the last decade Mr. Shaber had taught advanced screenwriting at Columbia University.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Samantha, of New York, and Remy, of Boston, and a brother, Dr. Gary Shaber of Philadelphia.
