        Anastassios Fondaras, who went from a career in the Royal Greek Navy and later in Greece's private shipping industry to international investment banking, died on Thursday at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York. He was 81.
        The cause of death was complications from a fall, his family said.
        Although Mr. Fondaras, who was born in Preveza, Greece, earned a law degree from Harvard University, the sea and subjects related to it were his foremost love. He held a master's degree in naval architecture and marine engineering from the Royal Greek Naval Academy, and served in the Greek Royal Navy during World War II. He retired from the Navy in 1943 with the rank of commander and was later promoted to rear admiral.
        After the war, Mr. Fondaras joined the Niarchos Shipping Group, run by the Greek shipping magnate Stavros Niarchos, and soon became managing director of the group. He resigned from Niarchos in 1958 and joined the investment banking firm Kidder Peabody in New York. A few years later he became manager of the Paris office of the investment banking firm White Weld. During the last three decades he comfortably straddled three cultures, traveling frequently between New York, Paris and Athens.
        Mr. Fondaras is survived by his wife, Elizabeth; two daughters, Kristina Fondaras Lamont of London and Antonia Fondaras of Washington; two sisters, Anna Safiliou and Fofi Trezos, both of Athens; a niece, Dina Safiliou Rothschild, and six grandchildren.
