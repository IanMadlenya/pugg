        Philip G. Kuehn, who twice lost narrow elections for governor of Wisconsin, died Sunday at home in Picayune, Miss. He was 72 years old.
        He died of complications from a stroke, his family said.
        Mr. Kuehn (pronounced keen) was a former chairman of the International Association of Refrigerated Warehousers and the Refrigeration Research Foundation.
        A longtime Republican, he was the party's Wisconsin state chairman from 1955-58. After moving south, he became Louisiana's Republican finance chairman.
        In his first bid for governor, in 1960, he nearly upset the incumbent, Gaylord Nelson, losing by 50,000 votes out of 1.7 million. In 1962 he lost by 12,000 votes out of 1.2 million, to John W. Reynolds. Although Mr. Kuehn was a conservative, he pressed for a state sales tax. His second defeat was attributed to that issue.
        Mr. Kuehn headed his family's company, Wisconsin Cold Storage, now named Wisco. He later became general manager of U.S. Cold Storage in Miami, and then president of the New Orleans Cold Storage Company. There he fought union rules in a decadelong suit that he ultimately won in the United States Supreme Court. He retired in 1985.
        Mr. Kuehn was known as Buz. He was born in Milwaukee and graduated from Cornell University. In World War II he served as a first lieutenant in the Army.
        His marriage to the former Margery Holley ended in divorce.
        He is survived by his second wife, the former Mildred Jones; a daughter, Barbara Frank of Winnetka, Ill.; two sons, Philip Jr., of Grafton, Wis., and John C., of Champaign, Ill.; a brother, James Kuehn of Milwaukee, and six grandchildren.
