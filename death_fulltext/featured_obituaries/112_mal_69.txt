        Edgar Ortenberg, a violinist in the Budapest String Quartet in the 1940's and a violin teacher in Philadelphia, died on Thursday at his home in Philadelphia.  He was 96.
        Mr. Ortenberg was born in Odessa and studied with Naoum Blinder at the Odessa Conservatory, and later with Jacques Thibaud in Paris. After his graduation in 1924, he was appointed concertmaster of the Odessa Opera Orchestra and took a teaching position at the conservatory. Two years later he moved to Berlin to continue his studies at the Berlin Hochschule fur Musik. At that time he changed his first name from Eleazar to Edgar and formed the Berlin String Quartet, which toured widely in Europe until 1933, when the new Nazi Ministry of Culture reconstituted the quartet without its Jewish players.
        That year, Mr. Ortenberg left Berlin for Paris with his wife, Tamara, and formed another ensemble, the Quatuor Ortambert. He became a French citizen in 1937.
        While he was in Paris, he was invited to join the Budapest Quartet as a violist, and although he at first agreed, he withdrew his acceptance after his wife objected to his switching instruments.
        When the Nazis invaded France in 1940, the Ortenbergs fled to the United States by way of Portugal. In New York, Mr. Ortenberg taught privately and performed in an orchestra sponsored by WQXR, the radio station owned by The New  York Times, until the end of 1943, when the Budapest Quartet invited him to join as second violinist. This time he accepted, and he performed with the quartet until 1949. His performance in a 1945 concert recording of the Brahms Piano Quintet with George Szell as the pianist was recently released on CD by Bridge Records.
        After he left the Budapest Quartet, Mr. Ortenberg moved to Philadelphia and took teaching positions at Temple University and the Settlement Music School. He retired from teaching in 1988.
        He is survived by his wife, whom he married in 1929.
