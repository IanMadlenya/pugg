        George Nemeny, whose designs for family homes on Long Island earned him dozens of architecture awards in the 1950's and 60's, died on Sunday at the Village Nursing Home in Greenwich Village. He was 86 and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Nemeny, a native of Budapest, established himself as an architect in New York City after his graduation from Cornell University College of Architecture in 1934. He won his first award in 1935 -- a Gold Medal in the American Academy in Rome Competition -- and went on to pioneer the cause of contemporary architecture in this country.
        For the next 40 years, until his retirement in the mid-1970's, he practiced his profession in and around New York City. He worked both alone and with renowned partners like the modernist Abraham W. Geller.
        He traveled widely and had his designs published in the United States and in Europe, South America and Japan. Over the years he taught architectural design at Yale and Columbia and, as a visiting critic, at Cornell.
        His striking, airy residential designs led to his selection as one of the country's 10 leading architects by the American Institute of Architects in 1957, 1963 and 1964. His nomination as a fellow of the institute in 1967 was sponsored by Marcel Breuer, Philip Johnson, Edward D. Stone and Max O. Urbahn, among others.
        He won the praise of his peers for simple and clear lines, good planning, the use of appropriate materials, structural integrity and relating his buildings to their settings and human needs. He advanced architecture, they agreed, ''by bringing good design to a large segment of the population, both by teaching and his work.''
        Mr. Nemeny is survived by two daughters, Laurie Estep of San Diego, and Patricia Berman of Great Neck, N.Y., and six grandchildren.
