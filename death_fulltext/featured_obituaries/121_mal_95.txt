        James T. Tierney, formerly chief executive of the Fund for Peace, a nonprofit organization that focuses on such issues as human rights, the security of nations and conflict resolution, died on Jan. 26 at his home in Phoenix. He was 74.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, said his daughter, Anita Tierney.
        In World War II, Mr. Tierney was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross after completing 25 daylight bombing missions over Germany. The loss of planes and airmen influenced him to devote his life to arms control and the search for peaceful ways to settle international conflicts.
        During the summers of 1986 through 1994, he served as a member of the United States Consulting Team on Arms Control, a private organization of Canadian and American experts who traveled to Moscow to discuss weapons control.
        Born on Oct. 19, 1922, in Fall River, Mass., he earned bachelor's and master's degrees from Brown University. In 1956 he earned a doctorate there in political science and international relations. He then won a Ford Foundation fellowship to study in India, Pakistan and Britain.
        He then joined the Ford Foundation, which stationed him for three years in Mexico City, where he was in charge of education programs in Mexico and Central America.
        In 1977, he was named the head of the Fund for Peace, which was then based in New York but now maintains headquarters in Washington. He retired in 1988.
        A resident of Scarsdale for 26 years, he is survived by his wife, Madeleine, of Phoenix; five children, Anita and Marc, both of Manhattan, Margo T. DiRenno, of Ossining, N.Y., James J., of Gaithersburg, Md., Michael, of Tempe, Ariz., and six grandchildren.
