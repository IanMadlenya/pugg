        Joel Buchsbaum, who turned a thwarted childhood interest in sports into a career as a nationally recognized analyst of professional football, died on Sunday at his home in Brooklyn. He was 48.
        Ellen Borokove, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office, said he died of natural causes.
        Mr. Buchsbaum, who wrote about football for Pro Football Weekly and was a guest commentator on sports radio shows on KMOX in St. Louis and KTRH in Houston, had an encyclopedic knowledge of the sport. He wrote two books each year evaluating college players for the National Football League's spring draft.
        Small and frail and with large eyeglasses, Mr. Buchsbaum looked out of place on draft day as the college players he had written about accepted offers worth millions of dollars.
        ''Draft day is now the second biggest day of the year behind the Super Bowl,'' the Giants general manager, Ernie Accorsi, said yesterday. ''Joel had a lot to do with what became the glorification of draft day. ESPN started putting it on the air live, but Joel helped them get interested in it.''
        Mr. Buchsbaum was born in Brooklyn in 1954 to Stanley and Frances Buchsbaum. His father, who died in 1999, had been a first assistant corporation counsel for New York City.
        Deemed too small and uncoordinated by a coach in the Police Athletic League, Joel Buchsbaum spent hours in the stands studying the players.
        In 1979, he began writing for Pro Football Weekly, and that year he wrote the first draft book, ''Pro Football Weekly and Scout's Notebook '79.'' An annual analysis of the top 600 college players followed, based on Mr. Buchsbaum's interviews with hundreds of people. Despite the title's reference to scout, Mr. Buchsbaum rejected the notion that he was one.
        ''He always said, 'I don't evaluate players, I listen to the right people,' '' Mr. Accorsi said.
        Mr. Buchsbaum is survived by his mother, of Brooklyn.
