        Paul Rene Doguereau, a pianist, an exponent of the French piano repertory and the founding director of the Peabody-Mason Music Foundation in Boston, died on March 3 in Mount Holly, N.J. He was 91.
        Born on Sept. 8, 1908, in Angers, France, to a family whose ancestors included a bishop guillotined during the French Revolution, Mr. Doguereau began studying as a young boy with the noted French pianist Marguerite Long.
        He was later coached in the works of Debussy by the composer's widow, Emma Bardac, and studied with Ravel.
        During the 1940's, his teachers included the pianists Paderewski, Egon Petri and Emil von Sauer.
        His performing career took him to major European concert halls.
        Eventually he settled in the United States, living and teaching in Boston for more than 60 years.
        Mr. Doguereau's piano students include Earl Wild, Eugene Indjic, David Korevaar and Peter Orth.
        With the endowment of his friend and patron, Fanny Mason, Mr. Doguereau created the Peabody-Mason Music Foundation, which presented free concerts throughout the Boston area.
        Glenn Gould, Maurizio Pollini, Alicia de Larrocha and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau were among the artists who played in the series.
        Emerging performers, particularly young pianists, were also presented.
        Mr. Doguereau suspended the foundation in 1985 and transferred its funds (valued at nearly $2 million) to the Boston Symphony Orchestra.
        He is survived by an adopted son, Harrison James Wignall, who is a musicologist and novelist, and a sister, Micheline van Smith of Cambridge, Mass.
