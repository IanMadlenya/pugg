        Otto F. Kraushaar, former president of Goucher College, died Saturday at his home in Baltimore after a long illness. He was 87 years old.
        Dr. Kraushaar was president of the college from 1948 to 1967, when he retired. He was credited with supervising Goucher's move in 1956 from Baltimore to a new campus in Towson, Md., and leading it out of financial difficulties to emerge as a nationally ranked women's college. It has since become coeducational.
        He had also served on a Maryland commission on higher education and on a gubernatorial task force on interracial problems and relations.
        Dr. Kraushaar was a graduate of the University of Iowa, where he received a master's degree. He also held a doctorate in philosophy from Harvard University. He taught philosophy at Smith College for 12 years before becoming Goucher's president.
        He is survived by a sister, Amalie Nelson of Dublin, Iowa, and five grandchildren.
