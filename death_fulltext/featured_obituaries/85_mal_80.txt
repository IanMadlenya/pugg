        Robert Bloom, an oboist, composer and teacher, died on Sunday at Christ Hospital in Cincinnati. He was 85 and lived in Cincinnati.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Sara Lambert Bloom.
        In a career spanning more than half a century, Mr. Bloom played in several major orchestras, including the NBC Orchestra under Toscanini, where he was the principal oboist, and the Philadelphia Orchestra under Stokowski, where he was the assistant principal oboist and also played English horn. He was a founding member of the Bach Aria Group, with which he performed until 1980, and he played in hundreds of recordings under Bernstein, Klemperer, Stravinsky and other conductors.
        Mr. Bloom was born in Pittsburgh, and studied at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. His Sonatina and other works have become staples of the repertory. He was a longtime faculty member at the Juilliard School and the Yale School of Music.
        In addition to his wife, who is also an oboist, he is survived by two sons, Jonathan and David; two daughters, Katherine Bronski and Julia Hayes; two sisters, Rosalia Grodner and Sara Eisenstadt, and four grandchildren.
