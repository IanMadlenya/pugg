        Judge Robert Madden Hill of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, who presided over the Billy Sol Estes trial in 1979 as a Federal District judge, died Monday on a flight from Africa. He was 59 years old.
        Judge Hill died after an asthma attack as he and his wife, State Representative Patricia Hill, were returning from vacation in Kenya, said Carol Hallman, a spokeswoman for the Fifth Circuit court.
        In 1979 Mr. Estes, a close associate of former President Johnson, was convicted of mail fraud and conspiracy to conceal his assets to avoid paying back taxes. Judge Hill sentenced the flamboyant West Texan, who had been convicted years before of a federal violation involving mortgages on nonexistent fertilizer tanks, to 10 years in prison, the maximum sentence.
        Judge Hill received his law degree from the University of Texas in 1950, and practiced law until 1970, when President Nixon named him a Federal district judge. President Reagan appointed Judge Hill to the appellate court in 1984.
