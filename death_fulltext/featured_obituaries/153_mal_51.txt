        Dr. Earl Alison Evans, a pioneering biochemist who built up one of the nation's leading biochemistry departments at the University of Chicago, died on Oct. 5 at a hospital in Chicago, where he lived. He was 89.
        Dr. Evans, a professor emeritus and former chairman of the department of biochemistry and molecular biology at the university, was an early researcher into the use of radioactive isotopes to study metabolism and the use of a group of viruses known as bacteriophages to study the workings of DNA.
        He also pioneered the use of a short-lived carbon isotope, 11C, produced in the cyclotron at the University of Chicago by his colleague Louis Slotkin, and used it to show that animal cells, like photosynthetic plants, were capable of using carbon dioxide for the synthesis of carbohydrates, a process called CO2  fixation. His work with the isotope brought him the Lilly Medal in 1941.
        In 1942, he became chairman of the department and recruited acclaimed scientists including Konrad Bloch, who won the Nobel Prize in 1964 for his radioactive-tracer work on cholesterol biosynthesis. Dr. Evans stepped down as chairman in 1972, but continued to teach until 1980.
        Born on March 11, 1910, in Baltimore, Dr. Evans earned his bachelor's degree from Johns Hopkins University and a doctorate from Columbia University. He joined the faculty at Chicago as an instructor in 1937.
        Besides his work at Chicago, Dr. Evans spent one year, 1939, as a research fellow with Hans Krebs, who won a Nobel Prize in 1953. During World War II, Dr. Evans was the principal investigator in malaria research for the Federal Government's Office of Scientific Research and Development. After the war, he was the scientific attache in the United States Embassy in London for two years.
        He is survived by a son, David Lasswell of Chicago.
