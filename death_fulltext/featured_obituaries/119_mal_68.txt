        Al Santiago, a record producer, historian of Latin music and educator, who had a large impact on Latin music in New York City, died last Monday at Hudson Valley Hospital Center in Westchester. He was 64.

        Mr. Santiago first ventured into Latin music when he took over his father's orchestra in 1950. In 1955 he started Casa Alegre, a record shop in the Bronx, which gave the name to his next venture, Alegre Records, which shaped the sound of Latin music in America. He recorded stars like Eddie Palmieri, Tito Puente, Johnny Pacheco, Orlando Marin and Louie Ramirez. In 1966 he sold the company and went on to become a record produce, working with artists like Celia Cruz, Willie Colon and Mongo Santamaria.
        In the mid-1980's he changed careers and became a bilingual music educator, then a clinical psychologist. At the same time he founding Mucho Music, which released Ponce, an album by a Puerto Rican band, Orchesta Pueblo.
        He is survived by his wife, Louise, and four children, Melody, Orchid, Clef and Duane.
