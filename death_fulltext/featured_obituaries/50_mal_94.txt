        Joseph Baer, a former president of the newspaper drivers' union in New York, died yesterday at the Princeton Medical Center in Princeton, N.J. He was 79 years old and lived in Monroe Township, N.J.
        He died of lung cancer, a family spokesman said.
        Mr. Baer was first elected president of the Newspaper and Mail Deliverers' Union of New York and Vicinity on a reform slate in May 1959. Meanwhile, departing union leaders were invoking the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination before a Senate rackets committee when asked to testify whether they had accepted payoffs from newspaper distributors to prevent labor trouble.
        Mr. Baer, in testifying before the panel, denied accepting any payoffs, defended the honesty and integrity of rank-and-file members and pledged to conduct the union's affairs honorably.
        He was born in Manhattan, where he attended public schools, and lived in Jersey City for nearly 40 years. After completing high school, he was a clerk on The New York Telegram and then a driver for The New York Post. He was elected business agent of the drivers' union in 1956, president from 1959 to 1969 and executive director of its pension and welfare funds for 10 more years, retiring in 1979.
        In World War II, he served in the Army in Europe, was wounded in the Battle of the Bulge and received a Bronze Star. He was a former commander and the 1965 Man of the Year of the Floyd Gibbons Post of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Manhattan.
        Surviving are his wife, Beatrice; two daughters, Phyllis Nova of West Hartford, Conn., and Karen Rockoff of Short Hills, N.J.; two brothers, Meyer, of Cranbury, N.J., and Louis, of Manhattan; a sister, Anna Fox of Rochester, and five grandchildren.
