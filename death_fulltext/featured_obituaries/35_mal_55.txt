        Sammy Fain, who wrote the music for such well-loved popular songs as ''I'll Be Seeing You,'' ''That Old Feeling,'' ''Secret Love'' and ''Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing,'' died of a heart attack yesterday at the U.C.L.A. Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was 87 years old.
        During a songwriting career of more than six decades, Mr. Fain won two Academy Awards for best song: ''Secret Love,'' from the 1953 Doris Day movie ''Calamity Jane,'' and the title song from ''Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing'' (1955). The songs, both with lyrics by Paul Francis Webster, became No. 1 records, for Miss Day and the Four Aces, respectively.
        Among Mr. Fain's other major songs are ''I Can Dream, Can't I'' (1938; lyrics by Irving Kahal), ''Dear Hearts and Gentle People'' (1950; lyrics by Bob Hilliard), and the best-selling title song from the Pat Boone film ''April Love'' (1957). Worked in Vaudeville
        Mr. Fain was born in New York City on June 17, 1902, and named Samuel Feinberg. A trained pianist, he worked in vaudeville and in the music publishing business as a song plugger before achieving his first success as a composer in the mid-1920's.
        Among his early hits were ''Nobody Knows What a Red-Head Mama Can Do'' (1925), ''Let a Smile Be Your Umbrella on a Rainy (Rainy) Day'' (1927), ''Wedding Bells Are Breaking Up That Old Gang of Mine'' 1929) and ''When I Take My Sugar to Tea'' (1931).'' Most were written with Mr. Kahal, his principal collaborator in the early years, whom he met in New York in the early 1920's. Mr. Kahal died in 1942.
        Called to Hollywood, the team of Fain and Kahal wrote songs for a number of movie musicals, including ''Footlight Parade'' (1933), ''Dames'' (1934) and ''Sweet Music'' (1935). One of their earliest successful movie songs, ''You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me,'' was introduced by Maurice Chevalier in ''The Big Pond'' (1930). Dick Powell introduced ''By a Waterfall'' in ''Footlight Parade.'' ''That Old Feeling,'' one of the great torch ballads of all time, was introduced in the movie ''Vogues of 1938.'' Wrote for 'Hellzapoppin'
        In 1938, Mr. Fain returned to New York to collaborate with Charles Tobias on songs for Olsen and Johnson's hit vaudeville revue, ''Hellzapoppin','' which ran on Broadway for more than 1,400 performances. None of the show's songs were hits, but ''Right This Way,'' which ran for only 14 performances the same year, yielded two of his most famous ballads, ''I Can Dream, Can't I'' and ''I'll Be Seeing You'' (written with Mr. Kahal). Although ''I Can Dream, Can't I'' was a hit for Tommy Dorsey in 1938, its most famous rendition was the 1950 recording by the Andrews Sisters.
        ''I'll Be Seeing You'' was popularized in nightclubs in the 1940's and went on to become one of the romantic signature songs of World War II. Closely associated with the cabaret singer Hildegarde, the song was a hit for Bing Crosby in 1944 and inspired the title of a film starring Ginger Rogers and Shirley Temple. In the 1950's it became a theme song for Liberace.
        Mr. Fain achieved his greatest success in Hollywood during the 1950's. With the lyricist Bob Hilliard he composed the songs for the 1951 Disney film ''Alice in Wonderland,'' including ''I'm Late.'' Two years later, he and Mr. Webster collaborated on the score for ''Calamity Jane,'' for which he won his first Oscar. In the same year, he teamed with Sammy Cahn to write another Disney film score, for ''Peter Pan.'' Among its songs was ''The Second Star to the Right.'' Formal Ballads
        Following their success with ''Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing,'' Mr. Fain and Mr. Webster supplied the title songs for a number of other films, including ''A Certain Smile'' (1958) and ''Tender Is the Night'' (1961). These grandly formal ballads epitomized the official style of movie theme music for 20th Century-Fox pictures of the period.
        Some of the other movies for which he wrote songs in the 50's include ''Call Me Mister'' (1951), ''The Jazz Singer'' (1953), ''Three Sailors and a Girl (1953), ''Lucky Me'' (1954), ''Hollywood or Bust'' (1956), ''Mardi Gras'' (1958) and ''The Big Circus'' (1959).
        Some of Mr. Fain's other collaborators were Harold Adamson, Lew Brown, Howard Dietz, Ralph Freed, Mack Gordon, E. Y. Harburg, Pierre Norman, Mitchell Parish, Jerry Seelen and Jack Yellen.
        Mr. Fain periodically returned to Broadway. His last four musicals were ''Flahooley'' (1951; lyrics by Mr. Harburg), ''Ankles Aweigh'' (1955; lyrics by Don Shapiro), ''Christine'' (1960; lyrics by Mr. Webster) and ''Something More'' (1964; lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman).
        In addition to the two Academy Awards, Mr. Fain's songs received 10 Academy Award nominations. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1971. Early this year, he was presented with a special award by The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, on whose board of directors he served from 1979 until his death.
        He is survived by his son, Frank, of New York City.
