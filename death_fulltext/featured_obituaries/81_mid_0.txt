        Annette Giacometti, who often modeled for her husband, the Swiss sculptor Alberto Giacometti, died on Sept. 19 in Paris, the British newspaper The Independent reported last week. She was 70.
        Her death was announced by the Alberto and Annette Giacometti Association, which did not disclose the cause.
        Mrs. Giacometti, whose maiden name was Arm, was born to a middle-class family in Switzerland and came to know Mr. Giacometti, an artist's son, in 1943, while he was working in her native Geneva during World War II.
        After the war, he moved back to Paris. She became his companion there, and they married in 1949. For years they lived in one of the two rooms of a studio in a poor quarter of Paris. Mr. Giacometti worked in the other room.
        Over the years, Mrs. Giacometti was one of her husband's principal models, along with his brother Diego. She modeled not only for his sculptures, but also for paintings and drawings.
        She was the subject of a series of 10 busts he did late in his career, including "Annette IV" (1962), a bronze that is less elongated than many of his sculptures. In its, she stares straight ahead, wide-eyed and enigmatic. His portraits of her have sometimes been called obsessive.
        Alberto Giacometti died in 1966 in Switzerland, at the age of 64.
