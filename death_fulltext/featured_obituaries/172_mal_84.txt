        Maurice J. Noble, a film animator whose award-winning design work can be seen in the Disney classics ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,'' ''Bambi,'' ''Dumbo'' and ''Fantasia,'' died on May 18 at his home in La Crescenta, Calif. He was 91.
        In addition to the Walt Disney Company, Mr. Noble also worked for Warner Brothers on cartoons including ''What's Opera, Doc?'' and ''Duck Amuck,'' both of which were inducted into the National Film Registry.
        For Chuck Jones Film Productions he directed ''The Dot and the Line,'' an Academy Award winner for best short animated subject in 1961. Mr. Noble also collaborated with Mr. Jones at MGM, where they produced the Dr. Seuss cartoons ''The Cat in the Hat,'' ''Horton Hears a Who'' and the original animated adaptation of ''How the Grinch Stole Christmas.''
        Mr. Noble ''changed the way backgrounds were designed,''' said Don Hall, a Disney storyboard artist. ''His style was all about bold color choices. His backgrounds were warm and interesting, and he was careful to make them subordinate to the characters.''
        Born on May 1, 1910, in Minnesota, Mr. Noble moved with his family to California, where he attended Chouinard Art Institute before he began an advertising career. One of his ad campaigns was the creation of the Red Door brand for Elizabeth Arden.
        Mr. Noble is survived by his wife, Marjorie; two children; and a grandson.
        Correction:  May 30, 2001, Wednesday  An obituary of the film animator Maurice J. Noble on Friday omitted his collaborator for the Academy Award-winning short animated subject ''The Dot and the Line'' and misstated the year of the prize. He directed the film with Chuck Jones. They won in 1965, not 1961.
