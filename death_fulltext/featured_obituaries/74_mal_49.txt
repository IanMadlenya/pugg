        Arthur S. Parsons, a professor of sociology and a member of the Smith College faculty for the last 20 years, died Saturday at a nursing home in Northampton, Mass. He was 47.
        The college said the cause was complications of AIDS.
        Dr. Parsons, a native of Washington, was a cum laude graduate in social studies of Wesleyan University. He received a master's degree in city and regional planning from Harvard University and a Ph.D. in sociology from Brandeis University in 1973, the year he joined Smith, which is in Northampton.
        His research subjects included the Unification Church, phenomenology and the work of Alfred Schutz, the sociologist. He was a frequent contributor to sociological journals.
        Dr. Parsons is survived by his companion, William G. Hungerford of Northampton; his brothers, Roger Parsons of Monmouth, Calif., and Richard Parsons of Ojai, Calif., and his stepmother, Janette Rainwater of Pacific Palisades, Calif.
