        William Howard Taft 3d, a former Ambassador to Ireland, died on Saturday at his home in Washington, D.C. He was 75 years old.
        He died of prostate cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Taft, whose grandfather was the 27th President and a Chief Justice of the United States and whose father and brother were Senators, taught college English before entering the diplomatic service. He was Ambassador to Ireland from 1953 to 1957 and continued in the State Department as a member of its policy planning staff until 1960, when he became Consul General in Mozambique. Later he worked in the State Department's bureau for scientific, environmental and space affairs before he retired in 1977.
        He was raised in Cincinnati, was a graduate of Yale and earned a doctorate at Princeton. He taught English at the University of Maryland and at Haverford College before becoming an analyst in military intelligence in World War II.
        After the war, he returned to teach at Yale and in 1949 went to Dublin with a Marshall Plan aid mission. From 1951 to 1953 he was with the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Department.
        Mr. Taft's father, Robert A. Taft Sr., was a Republican Senator from Oho and a Presidential aspirant in the postwar period. His brother, Robert Jr., was also a Republican Senator from Onio.
        He is survived by his brother; his wife of 48 years, the former Barbara Bradfield; two sons, Sean of Washington and William 4th, who is the United States delegate to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and who lives in Brussels; two daughters, Maria Clemow of Toulouse, France, and Martha Golden of Cranleigh, England; two granddaughters, and seven grandsons.
