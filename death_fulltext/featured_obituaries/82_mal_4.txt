        Frank A. Tedesco, founder and president of Academy Bus Lines, the second-largest privately owned bus transportation company in the country, died on Saturday in Mount Sinai Medical Center. He was 68 and lived in Bayonne, N.J.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        After teaching for 17 years at the Academy of Aeronautics on Long Island, Mr. Tedesco started his bus company in 1969. It operates more than 450 buses that use six terminals in New York City, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
        In 1971, after an accident in which one of his buses ran off the road, killing seven Long Island children, involuntary manslaughter charges against Mr. Tedesco were dismissed in Allentown, Pa.
        Last year, Mr. Tedesco received the Humanitarian of the Year Award from the Children of the World Program of Deborah Heart and Lung Center of New Jersey, which provides free surgery for children with congenital heart defects.
        Mr. Tedesco is survived by his wife, Josephine; two sons, Francis of Englewood, N.J., and Mark of Fort Lee, N.J.; three sisters, Anita Scocca of Clark, N.J., Lena Mosca of Old Bridge, N.J., and Elvira Antinoro of Holmdel, N.J., and two grandchildren.
