        Prof. Lawrence B. Anderson, an architect and former dean of the School of Architecture and Planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, died on Wednesday at Emerson Hospital in Concord, Mass. He was 87 and lived in Lincoln, Mass.
        The cause was heart and kidney failure, his family said.
        Professor Anderson was chairman of M.I.T.'s department of architecture from 1947 until 1965, when he became dean. He served until 1972, when he reached emeritus status.
        He was an adviser and consultant on civic developments, campus planning and government buildings in this country and abroad. Among the buildings was Boston City Hall in the early 1960's.
        After retiring, he kept in touch with hundreds of former students. He also took to painting watercolors; seven works, painted in Italy in October, were recently shown at the Concord Art Association.
        He was born in Geneva, Minn., received an undergraduate degree from the University of Minnesota and earned a graduate degree in architecture at M.I.T. in 1930. That year he took first place in the Paris Prize competition of the Society of Beaux Arts Architects, which enabled him to study in Paris and travel in Europe for more than two years.
        He returned to M.I.T. in 1933 as an assistant professor and became a full professor 11 years later.
        He was also a partner in the Cambridge firm of Anderson, Beckwith & Haible, founded in 1939, and together with Prof. Herbert L. Beckwith designed the Alumni Pool and other buildings at M.I.T.
        The university honored him by establishing a biennial $10,000 award in his name. The fund endowing the award was begun by two former students, I. M. Pei and William E. Hartmann.
        Professor Anderson's wife, Rosina duPont Anderson, died in 1992. He is survived by a son, Lawrence S., of Whitehouse, Ohio; two daughters, Judith Lawler of South Nyack,, N.Y., and Karen Cantine of Edmonton, Alberta, and seven grandchildren.
