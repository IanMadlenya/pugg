        He was born in Hardeeville, S.C., and graduated from New York University in 1973.
        He is survived by his mother, Ida Mae, of Hardeeville; six brothers, Curtis and Ronald, both of Boston, Martin and Mario, both of New York City and Jerry and Alfred, both of Hardeeville, and a sister, Nicolia, also of Hardeeville.
