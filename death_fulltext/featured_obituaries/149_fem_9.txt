        Ms. Hujer, who was trained in ballet by Theodore Kosloff, danced on the West Coast and in films before moving to Manhattan in the early 1940's. She performed in Broadway musicals and operettas and toured the United States in musical theater.
        Ms. Hujer formed her company, the Flower Hujer Dance Theater, in 1949 and designed many of the performers' exotic costumes. Her dances, based on religious and nature themes and praised for their dignity and simplicity, were presented in Trinity Church, St. Bartholomew's, the Chapel of the Intercession and other places.
        Ms. Hujer and her dancers continued to perform into the early 1990's. .
