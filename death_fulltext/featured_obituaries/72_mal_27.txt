        John Dorr, a filmmaker and gallery owner, died Friday at Century City Hospital in Los Angeles. He was 48 and lived in West Hollywood, Calif.
        Mr. Dorr died of complications of AIDS, said Michael Kaplan, a friend.
        Mr. Dorr was the founder of EZTV, a video gallery and production and distribution center that enables independent filmmakers to produce inexpensive feature-length videos.
        Mr. Dorr was involved in the production of more than 100 video films since he opened the gallery in 1980. Among the productions was the Lannen Literary Series, hourlong programs on major poets and writers, and a film recounting the Hollywood career of the writer Dorothy Parker.
        Mr. Dorr is survived by his companion, George LaFleur; a brother, Dudley A. Dorr of West Sand Lake, N.Y.; three sisters, Carolyn Dorr Rich of Mount Vernon, N.H., Martha Dorr of Worcester, Mass., and Judith Stewart of Brandon, Vt.; his stepmother, Nancy Dorr of Lancaster, Mass., and a stepsister, Molly Hagan of San Francisco.
