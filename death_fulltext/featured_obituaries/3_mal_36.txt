        Archbishop Kevin McNamara of Dublin, died of cancer today at his residence here. He was 60 years old.
        The Archbishop was second in the Irish Catholic hierarchy to Tomas Cardinal O Fiaich, Archbishop of Armagh and primate of all Ireland.
        Archbishop McNamara, who was regarded as one of the most conservative leaders of the Irish church, strongly supported the Irish Republic's opposition to divorce, family planning and abortion.
        In an interview last June, he likened divorce to the fallout from the Soviet nuclear accident at Chernobyl, saying divorce legislation ''permeated Western societies and undermined the stability of married life.''
        He became Dublin's Archbishop in 1984 after serving as Bishop of Kerry.
        A native of Newmarket-on-Fergus, County Clare, he was for many years vice president and professor of dogmatic theology at the national seminary of St. Patrick's College, Maynooth.
