        Dr. John A. D. Cooper, a medical educator who helped shape national policy as the first full-time physician president of the American Association of Medical Colleges, died on Jan. 27 in Birmingham, Ala. He was 83 and lived in Birmingham.
        The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, the association said.
        The organization began modestly in 1876 when representatives of 22 medical colleges met in Philadelphia to consider ways to improve their programs. In 1969, the group recruited Dr. Cooper as a full-time chief executive and principal spokesman for the country's medical schools.
        At the time, Dr. Cooper, a biochemist and physician, was dean of sciences at the Northwestern University Medical School and was regarded as a national expert on medical curriculum.
        At the association he built a staff in Washington to play a role in national affairs and lobby for medical schools and teaching hospitals. Among its interests were financing for medical research, student financial assistance and Medicare reimbursements.
        John Allen Dicks Cooper was born in El Paso and graduated from New Mexico State University. He received a Ph.D. and his M.D. from Northwestern.
        He published more than 300 papers on biomedical research, medical education and health policy and care. After retiring from the medical schools association in 1986, he was on the faculty of the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston until 1996.
        Dr. Cooper is survived by his wife of 57 years, Mary Jane Stratton Cooper; two daughters, Margaret Ann Cooper of Charlottesville, Va., and Patricia C. Isbell of Knoxville, Tenn.; two sons, J. Allen D. Jr., of Birmingham, and Randolph A. S., of Raleigh, N.C.; and eight grandchildren.
