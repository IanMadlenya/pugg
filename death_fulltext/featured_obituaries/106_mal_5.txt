        Joseph Lindmayer, a physicist who specialized in the harnessing of energy from sunlight and focused laser beams, died on Friday at his home in Potomac, Md. He was 66.
        The apparent cause was a heart attack, said a longtime friend, Emeric Podraczky.
        Dr. Lindmayer was the chairman and president of the Quantex Corporation of Rockville, Md., a digital imaging company he founded in 1984.
        Dr. Lindmayer, who was born in Budapest, received a master's degree from Williams College and a Ph.D. from Aachen Technical University in Germany. He worked at the Communications Satellite Corporation, developing a cell that converted solar energy into electricity, before founding the Solarex Corporation, which produces voltaic cells, in 1973. He sold the company in 1982.
        He is survived by his wife of 40 years, Katalin Komlossy Lindmayer; a son, Roland, and a daughter, Monika, all of Potomac, and three grandchildren.
        Correction:  November 6, 1995, Monday
        An obituary on Wednesday about Joseph Lindmayer, a physicist and chairman of  the Quantex Corporation of Rockville, Md., misstated the length of his marriage  to Katalin Komlossy Lindmayer. They were married in 1994. The obituary also omitted the name of Mr. Lindmayer's first wife, the mother of his two children.  She was Klara Lindmayer, who died in 1982.
