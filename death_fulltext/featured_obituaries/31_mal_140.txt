        Mr. Vogler, who was born in the Bronx, worked on Broadway productions including ''Godspell,'' ''The Most Happy Fella,'' ''The Magic Show,'' ''American Buffalo'' and ''Torch Song Trilogy.'' His last production, before illness forced him to stop working, was a concert in Central Park starring Angela Lansbury, in celebration of the reopening of the Statue of Liberty.
        He is survived by a sister, Linda Monahan of New Rochelle, N.Y.
