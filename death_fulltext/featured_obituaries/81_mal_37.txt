        George A. W. Boehm, a journalist and author on scientific subjects and an expert in contract bridge, died on Thursday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. He was 71.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Boehm's lifelong occupation was as a science writer and editor. He was science editor and deputy senior editor of Newsweek from 1949 to 1954, a member of the board of editors of Scientific American from 1955 to 1956 and a science editor at Fortune magazine for 10 years, starting in 1956.
        After leaving Fortune, he was a freelance writer for the rest of his career, contributing to Reader's Digest, The New York Times, Scientific American and the Harvard Business Review, among other publications.
        He was the author, along with the editors of Fortune, of "The New World of Math," a popular explanation of new mathematical ideas that was published by The Dial Press in 1959.
        Although he was an expert bridge player, he played mostly socially, competing professionally for only a short time and winning one major tournament in New York in 1955. For several years, he was the editor of Post Mortem, a magazine for tournament bridge players in New York. He was also a director and twice the vice president of the Greater New York Bridge Association.
        He was a native of Manhattan, where he lived most of his life, and graduated from Columbia University in 1942.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Alexandria Sarno; three daughters, Margaret S. of San Francisco, Barbara of Madison, Wis., and Juliana M. of Manhattan; two sons, August W., and Henry N., both of Manhattan, and one grandson.
