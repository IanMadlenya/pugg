        Joseph Yancey, a co-founder and the first coach of the New York Pioneers track and field club and an Olympic coach, died on Friday at Holy Name Hospital in Teaneck, N.J. He was 80 years old,
        He had apparently suffered a heart attack, according to his widow, Josephine.
        Mr. Yancey was elected to the Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1986.
        A native New Yorker who was educated at Virginia State University and New York University, Mr. Yancey began coaching before his graduation in 1935 from N.Y.U. where he was a weight-thrower. With Robert Douglas and William Culbreath, he founded the Pioneers Club team and became its first coach in 1936.
        He coached extensively on the international track circuit, serving as head coach of the Jamaican team in the Olympics of 1948, 1952 and 1956 and later guiding Olympic teams from the Bahamas, Trinidad and British Guiana. In 1952, he put together a 1,600-meter relay team that upset the United States and won the gold medal in world record time of 3 minutes 3.9 seconds.  Mr. Yancey, who lived in Teaneck, is survived by widow and three daughters, Yvonne Mayers ond Michele Walton of Teaneck and Josephine Skeete of Anchorage, and a sister, Thelma Greene of Detroit.
