        Haoui Montaug, a well-known New York disco doorman and cabaret producer in the 1970's and 80's, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 39 years old.
        He died of AIDS, said a spokeswoman for the New Music Seminar, where he was a panel director.
        Mr. Montaug was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Boston University. He was the ubiquitous doorman at the clubs of the moment: Hurrah, Danceteria, Studio 54 and the Palladium. In 1981, he started a cabaret revue called "I Dunno," later called "No Entiendes" ("You Don't Understand"). It toured the United States, Europe and Asia and had early appearances by Madonna and the Beastie Boys.
        Mr. Montaug appeared in the movies "Krush Groove" and "Cookie" and wrote frequently for the magazines Details, Paper and ID.
        He is survived by his sister, Carrie Goteiner, of Basking Ridge, N.J., and his mother, Miriam Ashkenazy, of Coconut Creek, Fla.
