        Robert Mason Estes, who retired in 1976 as a senior vice president and general counsel of the General Electric Company, died Monday at St. Joseph's Hospital in Yonkers. He was 81 and lived in Rye, N.Y.
        He had suffered a long illness, the company said.
        Mr. Estes grew up in Meredith, N.H., graduated magna cum laude from Dartmouth College and received a law degree at Harvard University in 1936. He then joined what is now Donovan, Leisure, Newton & Irvine, an international law firm based in Manhattan.
        In World War II, he joined the War Department's Chemical Warfare Service as director of its purchase policies board and chairman of its price adjustment board. He was discharged as a lieutenant colonel in the Army in 1946.
        That year, Mr. Estes went to work for General Electric as a lawyer for the appliance and merchandise department in Bridgeport, Conn. He held similar legal positions in Syracuse, Owensboro, Ky., Chicago and Louisville, Ky.
        He was named a vice president in 1964, when he became the parent company's general counsel and secretary. He became a senior vice president six years later.
        After his retirement from G.E., he taught corporate law at Columbia University for several years.
        Mr. Estes is survived by his wife, Priscilla Nelson Estes; two sons, Mark W. of Dallas and Peter M. of Malvern, Pa.; a daughter, Carolyn L. of San Miguel Allende, Mexico; a sister, Margaret Estes Harris of Keene, N.H., and one grandson.
