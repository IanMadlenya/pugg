        Phil M. Landrum, a Georgian who served in Congress for a quarter-century and helped write landmark legislation intended to curb union corruption, died Monday at Pickens General Hospital in Jasper, Ga. He was 83 years old and lived in Jasper.
        Mr. Landrum died of congestive heart failure, said his daughter, Susan Landrum.
        A Democrat, he was elected to the House of Representatives from Georgia's Ninth Congressional District in 1952 and served until he retired in 1977.
        Along with Representative Robert P. Griffin, Republican of Michigan, he wrote the 1959 Landrum-Griffin Act, which gave the Federal Government greater control over union affairs. It insured secret balloting in union elections, tightened bans on secondary boycotts and provided for financial reports by unions to the Secretary of Labor, with stiff penalties for willful violations.  Fought School Desegregation
        He was also chairman of the subcommittee on education, responsible for writing the Library Services Act. Included in the act were provisions for the establishment of bookmobile services to rural areas.
        In Congress he almost always voted against foreign aid and mutual security appropriations and was among Southern Congressmen who pledged in 1956 to use "all lawful means" to reverse the Supreme Court's desegregation ruling.
        A native of the chiefly agricultural area that he represented in Congress, Philip Marshall Landrum was born in the village of Martin in northeast Georgia. He graduated from Piedmont College in Demorest, Ga., and received a law degree from Atlanta Law School in 1941. In World War II he served in the Army Air Forces.
        Besides his daughter, he is survived by his wife, the former Laura Brown; a son, Phillip M. Jr., also of Jasper; a brother, James D. of Kennesaw, Ga.; a sister, Sara Haslett of Atlanta, and two grandchildren.
