        Carvel Collins, a professor and writer and an authority on the works of William Faulkner, died of a cerebral hemorrhage on Tuesday at Tri-City Hospital in Oceanside, Calif. He was 77 years old and lived in Vista, Calif.
        Professor Collins, who taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Notre Dame, was one of the first academics to recognize Faulkner as a major literary figure. In 1948, a year before Faulkner won the Nobel Prize for literature, Professor Collins held Harvard University's first seminar on the author.
        In scholarly articles, Professor Collins argued that Faulkner used Freudian, Jungian, mythic and religious themes to frame novels like ''The Sound and the Fury'' and ''Absalom, Absalom.'' Drawing on about 50 years of research, Professor Collins also showed that Faulkner was well read and cosmopolitan, in contrast to the rustic image that the author liked to present.
        Professor Collins's books include ''The American Sporting Gallery'' (1949) and ''Sam Ward in the Gold Rush'' (1949). He edited several collections of Faulkner's short stories and poetry as well as two of his novels, ''Mayday'' and ''The Unvanquished.''
        A native of West Union, Ohio, he received a bachelor's degree from Miami University in Ohio and his master's degree and doctorate from the University of Chicago.
        He is survived by his second wife, Ann Green; a daughter, Dr. Lucy Collins of New York City, and a step-granddaughter.
