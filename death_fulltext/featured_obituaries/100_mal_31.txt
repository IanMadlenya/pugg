        William C. Mulligan, a gardening writer who was an expert on the use of lattices to enhance outdoor spaces, died on Wednesday at Twelve Oaks Hospital in Houston. He was 52 and had moved to Houston from Manhattan in 1992.
        The cause was complications from AIDS, said his companion and frequent writing collaborator, Elvin McDonald of Houston.
        Mr. Mulligan put the spotlight on a long-neglected building block of the outdoor garden. For centuries, gardeners had used lattices and trellises to frame a distant view or give the illusion of space beyond an unsightly wall or obstruction. But Mr. Mulligan was the first American to concentrate exclusively on these elements of ornamentation.
        Mr. Mulligan recently completed his eighth gardening book, "The Lattice Gardener." It is to be released by Macmillan in October.
        Other recent garden books he wrote include "The Adventurous Gardener's Sourcebook of Rare and Unusual Plants" (Simon & Schuster, 1993) and two volumes of "The Complete Guide to North American Gardens (Little, Brown, 1991).
        Besides Mr. McDonald, Mr. Mulligan is survived by his mother, Eleanor, and a brother, Thomas F., both of Ringwood, N.J.
