        Irving G. Oppenheim, a familiar figure in New York City government for 43 years, including eight as Mayor John V. Lindsay's fleet-fingered night secretary, died on Feb. 29 at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. He was 83 and lived in the Bronx.
        Oppy, as he was known at City Hall, monitored the telephone at night in the Mayor's office during both of Mr. Lindsay's terms, from 1966 to 1973. He kept track of emergencies, ranging from police actions to breakdowns in city services and kept the Mayor and his aides informed.
        His shorthand speed was legendary; it was a skill he honed during 35 years in the City Morgue taking notes as the medical examiner performed autopsies.
        One night while moonlighting as a night stenographer working on legal documents for Thomas E. Dewey, he told Mr. Dewey, "Boss, I got to get out of the morgue alive." Mr. Dewey told him about a young man then running for Mayor, and  Mr. Oppenheim promptly went to work on the campaign, Mr. Lindsay's first. When Mr. Lindsay arrived at City Hall, he took Mr. Oppenheim with him.
        Mr. Lindsay also took him along in 1973 when he returned to his former law firm, Webster, Sheffield, Fleischmann, Hitchcock & Brookfield. Mr. Oppenheim put down his notepad a few years later.
        "He's the greatest boss," Mr. Oppenheim once said of Mr. Lindsay. "He never hollers, and he can do an out-box in no time."
        Mr. Oppenheim is survived by his brother, Siegfried, also of the Bronx.
