        Edward Irving Levy, a composer and professor of music at Yeshiva University in Manhattan, died on Tuesday at New York University Medical Center. He was 72 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was complications from pancreatic cancer, said his friend and colleague Noyes Bartholomew.
        Professor Levy was born in Brooklyn in 1929 and graduated from City College in 1957. He received a master's degree in music composition from Princeton and, in 1967, a doctorate in education from Columbia Teachers College.
        He taught at the Long Island campus of C. W. Post College from 1961-67 and at Yeshiva University from 1967 on. He was influenced by the linguistic research of Zelig Harris and Noam Chomsky and wrote an important article on the 12-tone composer Stefan Wolpe for the journal Perspectives of New Music in 1963.
        In his own music, Professor Levy drew from 12-tone systems and jazz. His pieces were performed by many new-music ensembles in New York and at the Darmstadt summer festival of contemporary music in Germany. A recent piece was called ''West of Nepal,'' an anagram for Stefan Wolpe.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary, and a brother, Martin, of Brooklyn.
