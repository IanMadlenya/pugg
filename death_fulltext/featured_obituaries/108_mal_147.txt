        Dr. Lincoln Riddler Page, a geologist and metallurgist who finished a 44-year career with the United States Geological Survey in 1973 as chief of its New England Regional Branch, died on Jan. 14 at Huggins Memorial Hospital in Wolfeboro, N.H. He was 85 and lived in Melvin Village, N.H.
        He joined the survey in 1939 and mapped chromite deposits in Oregon and tin deposits in the Pacific Northwest and the South. In the 1940's he was put in charge of surveys of rare metals countrywide, and in the 1950's he led uranium and thorium investigations in collaboration with the Atomic Energy Commission.
        He came to head the Northeastern branch in 1960 and developed cooperative ventures with the state geologists of Connecticut, New Hampshire and Massachusetts. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal of the Interior Department in 1967.
        After retiring from the agency, he conducted surveys overseas and was a member of the uranium group of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. He also spent two years as the state geologist of New Hampshire and at his death remained an adjunct professor at the University of New Hampshire.
        Dr. Page, a native of Lipson, N.H., graduated from Dartmouth College and earned an M.S. and a Ph.D. in geology and metallurgy at the University of Minnesota. He was the author or co-author of some 100 reports and maps and the editor of many more.
        Dr. Page's wife, Esther Lord Page, died many years ago.
        He is survived by two sons, Milton L. of Melvin Village, and Norman J. of Tucson, Ariz.; a sister, Miriam O. Page of Pike, N.H., and three grandsons.
