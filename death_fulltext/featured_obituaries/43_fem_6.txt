        Nelva M. Weber Sammataro, a landscape architect and columnist in New York and Connecticut, died on Tuesday at the Rose Haven nursing home in Litchfield, Conn. She was 81 years old and lived in Litchfield and Manhattan.
        Her family said she had been suffering from Alzheimer's disease.
        Ms. Weber, who was known professionally by her maiden name, was a native of Illinois and came to New York after earning a master's degree in landscape architecture at the University of Illinois in 1935. She first worked in the city Department of Parks and Recreation before starting her own business.
        Over the years, she designed the private estates of Mary Rockefeller, Oscar de la Renta, the comedian Gary Moore and the dancer Arthur Murray. Other clients included Illinois Wesleyan University, Bard College and the Shaker Museum in Massachusetts.
        Ms. Weber contributed articles to many publications, including The New York Times, where her occasional columns on horticulture and landscaping appeared from 1945 through the 1970's. She also lectured, ran workshops, and was the author of ''How to Design Your Own Home Landscape'' (Bobbs-Merrill, 1976).
        Ms. Weber is survived by her husband of more than 50 years, Joseph M. Sammataro, a retired architect; two daughters, Sandra S. Phillips of San Francisco and Diana Sammataro of Medina, Ohio; two sisters, Vera Campion of Rockford, Ill., and Lois La Rue of Pompano Beach, Fla., and one grandson.
