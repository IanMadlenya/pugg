        In 1983, Mr. Naumov was appointed head of the Institute of Informatics Problems, which conducts research intocomputer technology. In 1987, he also became director of the Intersectorial Scientific and Technological Complex, which works to research with manufacturing.
        Mr. Naumov was responsible for efforts to develop computer science as part of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's effort to revitalize the Soviet economy. In May, Mr. Naumov and members of a Soviet delegation requested a visa to the United States to solicit joint venture offers from American companies, but the United States Government turned them down, and Mr. Naumov wrote a letter of protest to President Reagan that was published in the Moscow News.
