        The Rev. Joseph G. Keegan, a Jesuit priest and former chairman of the psychology department at Fordham University, died on Jan. 26 at the Jesuit Infirmary on the university's Rose Hill campus in the Bronx. He was 88.
        The cause was heart failure, said Brother Gerard Schade, the infirmary director.
        Father Keegan, who entered the Society of Jesus in 1924, was ordained in 1936, six years after beginning his teaching career at Canisius College in Buffalo. He joined the Fordham faculty in 1942 as an instructor in experimental psychology. In 1946, he left to study at Yale University, receiving his doctorate in psychology in 1949.
        He returned to Fordham that year and began a decade as chairman of its psychology department. In all, he was a member of the department for more than 30 years. He achieved the rank of associate professor and served as director of the university's counseling center from 1961 to 1966.
        In addition to writing numerous articles for professional journals and contributing chapters to several books, Father Keegan was president of the American Catholic Psychological Association in 1951-52, vice president of the Bronx County Mental Health Society from 1958 to 1960 and a member of the American Psychological Association and the British Psychological Society.
        Father Keegan was born in Brooklyn and held a master's degree in philosophy and a licentiate in sacred theology from Woodstock College in Woodstock, Md. Besides his doctorate, he earned a master's degree in psychology from Yale.
        He retired from active teaching in 1974 but continued to provide counseling at Fordham for several years.
        Father Keegan is survived by a sister, Marie Keegan, of Floral Park, L.I.
