        Dr. Roy Allen Ginsburg, president of the San Francisco Psychoanalytic Institute and an associate professor of clinical psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine, died Friday at Stanford University Hospital in Stanford, Calif. He was 48 years old and lived in Palo Alto, Calif.
        He died of leukemia, which was diagnosed less than a week ago, a spokesman for the Medical Center said.
        He was born in Brooklyn to Russian immigrant parents and earned his bachelor's and medical degrees at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. He trained at the San Francisco institute, whose faculty he joined in 1988. He was named president three months ago.
        Dr. Ginsburg was on the Stanford faculty since 1976. He taught and supervised students of psychiatry, served as a staff physician at the University psychiatric clinic and taught the theory and practice of psychoanalysis to medical students.
        He acknowledged that psychoanalysis had limitations but he considered it to be the main clinical theory available in most modern psychotherapy.
        Last year, he organized an interdisciplinary conference at Stanford, bringing together philosophers, psychoanalysts, social critics, artists and writers to ponder Sigmund Freud's impact on American culture.
        "The work of Freud and others who followed him has expanded our understanding of human nature in general, and its influence on our society is almost unlimited," he told the conference. "Freud's ideas have been borrowed for novels, poetry, humor, and they guide the upbringing of children and also are reflected in current views on education and philosophy."
        He had his private practice in Menlo Park, serving patients from the Palo Alto area.
        Dr. Ginsburg is survived by his wife, Nancy; their four daughters, Robin, Heather, Sarah and Jessica, and one grandson, all of Palo Alto.
