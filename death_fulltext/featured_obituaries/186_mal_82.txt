        Ned Martin, a radio and television broadcaster for the Boston Red Sox for three decades, died Tuesday, a day after he appeared at Fenway Park for the team's tribute to Ted Williams. He was 78.
        Mr. Martin collapsed at Raleigh-Durham International Airport while en route to his home in Clarksville, Va. He had a heart attack, his wife, Barbara, said.
        Mr. Martin's signature call was ''Mercy.''
        ''He was the most literate of all broadcasters,'' the Red Sox broadcaster Joe Castiglione told The Boston Globe. ''He was a scholar of literature and a great Hemingway expert. He had a way of describing things very succinctly, honestly and openly. He never interfered with an event.''
        Mr. Martin began his career in the mid-1950's broadcasting minor league baseball in West Virginia. He joined Curt Gowdy in the Red Sox booth in 1961 and stayed until his retirement in 1992.
        He broadcast American League playoff games on CBS radio four times and worked the 1975 World Series for NBC television.
        Mr. Martin also did play-by-play for the National Football League's Patriots and for Harvard, Dartmouth and Yale football games.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Edwin, of Yarmouth Port, Mass.; two daughters, Caroline Michnay and O'Hara Martin, both of Orleans, Mass.; and nine grandchildren.
