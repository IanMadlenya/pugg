        Lenny Goodman, a jockey's agent for nearly 50 years at New York race tracks and the man who served as coach, tutor and surrogate father for the teen-aged jockey Steve Cauthen, died Tuesday evening at Mercy Hospital in Rockville Centre, L.I. He was 76.
        Mr. Goodman's wife, Kathleen, said he had suffered from poor health after being hospitalized for a stroke in 1993. His home was in Woodmere, L.I.
        He was a familiar figure at race tracks across the country, where he acted as the agent for several champion jockeys, including Mr. Cauthen, John Rotz, Bobby Ussery, Bill Hartack and Braulio Baeza. After Mr. Cauthen arrived in New York from Kentucky in 1976 as a 16-year-old rookie, he was represented by Mr. Goodman and also lived in the Goodman home. Mr. Cauthen won the Triple Crown in 1978 aboard the colt Affirmed. Mr. Goodman continued to represent jockeys until a few years ago, when he was booking mounts for Art Madrid Jr.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Carol and Ginny, and six grandchildren.
