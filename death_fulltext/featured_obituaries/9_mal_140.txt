        Prince Aspreno Colonna, patriarch of one of Rome's oldest noble families, died of a stroke Sunday, the family has announced. He was 71 years old.
        The prince was among the last of the Roman nobility to hold an honorary Vatican hereditary position. His title was prince assistant to the papal throne. Most of the titles held by the aristocracy were abolished by Pope Paul VI.
        Vatican officials said the title of prince assistant is no longer passed on automatically. If the Pope were to bestow the title, it could go to the prince's eldest son, Marcantonio, 39, or to someone else in another family.
        The Colonnas have been leaders among the Roman nobility for more than 1,000 years and played a major role in Rome in the Middle Ages, generally siding with the Ghibellines against the papacy.
        Despite that attitude, the family produced a pope, Martin V, in the early 15th century and more than 20 cardinals. The family's 450-room palace in Rome was begun by Martin V. After the unification of Italy in 1870 and the collapse of papal rule in Rome, two members of the family became the guarantors of the new state and were appointed senators.
