        Dorothy Stimson Bullitt, a major figure in Pacific Northwest broadcasting and founder of the King Broadcasting Company died Tuesday. She was 97 years old.
        Mrs. Bullitt, who inherited a real estate fortune, was a leading figure in the business and cultural life of Seattle for more than 50 years. In 1947 she founded King Broadcasting, bought an AM and FM radio station, KEVR, and changed the call letters to KING, for King County.
        She ran the organization with fierce independence, vowing never to sell air time to religious organizations. The ban remains at television station KING, Channel 5.
        She retired as company president in 1962 but remained honorary chairman of the board.
        She is survived by a son, Stimson, and two daughters, Priscilla Collins and Harriet Bullitt, all of Seattle; 10 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.
