        Seijiro Matsuoka, a real-estate entrepreneur and art collector, died of heart failure on March 20 in Toranomon Hospital in Tokyo. He was 95 years old and lived in Tokyo.
        He founded the Matsuoka Museum of Art in Tokyo, where his collection of thousands of works of Chinese porcelains, European and Oriental paintings and sculptures are displayed.
        Mr. Matsuoka, who was born in Tokyo, founded a trading company and made his first fortune as a jewelry dealer in World War I. In the 1920's he switched to real estate and owned several office buildings in Tokyo.
        An art collector throughout his adult life, he became internationally famous in the 1970's as one of the few major Japanese buyers of Chinese art, Impressionist paintings and antiquities in the West. He paid record prices for the art he bought at auctions in Hong Kong, London and New York that he attended until two years ago.
        He is survived by his wife, six daughters, 10 grandchildren and 30 great-grandchildren.
