        Enoch P. Waters, a former editor of The Chicago Defender who was a news correspondent for more than 40 years, died Friday.
        Mr. Waters, who was 77 years old, died just a few days after publication of his first book, ''American Diary,'' in which he described his experience as a pioneering black journalist.
        Mr. Waters, a native of Philadelphia, worked for The Chicago Defender, one of the nation's largest black daily newspapers, for 23 years. He rose to the position of executive editor before he left in 1957 to become editor of The Associated Negro Press, a wire service that served about 150 black weekly newspapers. He is survived by his wife, Regina.
