        Carlyle C. Douglas, an editor and reporter, died on Monday at Harper Hospital in Detroit. He was 45 years old and lived in Manhattan until three months ago.
        Mr. Douglas died of pneumonia, a complication of lung and brain cancer, his brother, David, said.

At The Times, where he worked until his death, he was a copy editor for The Week In Review and a reporter on the metropolitan staff.
        Mr. Douglas, a native of Chicago, was raised in Detroit and attended the University of Michigan. He began his career in Detroit in 1968 as a reporter for The Michigan Chronicle.
        He had planned to marry his fiancee, Jill Foley, this weekend.
        He is survived by his parents, Carlyle and Barbara Douglas of Detroit; three children from two marriages, a son, Scott, of Fostoria, Ohio, and two daughters, Jessica, of Manhattan, and Michelle, who lives on Long Island; two sisters, Linda Jones, and Brigid Krantz, both of Detroit, and a brother, David, of Benton Harbor, Mich.
