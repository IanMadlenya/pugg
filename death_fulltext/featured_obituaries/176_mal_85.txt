        Evan A. Lottman, a film editor whose work was nominated for an Academy Award, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 70.
        The cause was esophageal cancer, said his wife, Eileen.
        Born in the Bronx, Mr. Lottman began his career in the 1960's, editing television documentaries, including ''Churchill,'' ''F.D.R,'' ''W.W.I.'' and ''W.W.II.'' One of his first feature film jobs was editing the montages of pool scenes in ''The Hustler'' (1961), for which he did not receive credit, Mrs. Lottman said.
        Mr. Lottman's film work includes  ''The Panic in Needle Park'' (1971), ''The Seduction of Joe Tynan'' (1979), ''Sophie's Choice'' (1982), ''Presumed Innocent'' (1990) and ''The Exorcist'' (1973), for which he received an Oscar nomination. He also worked as an editor on ''Apocalypse Now'' (1979), in which he had a brief screen role.
        He also taught a graduate course in film editing at Columbia.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Lottman is survived by a brother, Herbert R. Lottman, of Paris. His daughter, Jessica, died in 1984.
