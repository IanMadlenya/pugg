        Warren Skaaren, who rewrote the troubled scripts of such films as "Batman" and "Beetlejuice," died on Friday night at his home here. He was 44 years old.
        Mr. Skaaren died of bone cancer, said his lawyer and friend, W. Amon Burton, who said Mr. Skaaren only learned how severe his condition was early this summer, shortly after completing his last screenplay, "Beetlejuice 2."
        During the 1980's, Mr. Skaaren gained a reputation as one of the country's top script doctors, a screenwriter who could take over a troubled script and rewrite it.
        The four films he was best known for rewriting -- "Batman," "Top Gun," "Beverly Hills Cop II" and "Beetlejuice" -- together grossed more than $1 billion.
        Mr. Skaaren was a native of Rochester, Minn., and graduated with an art degree from Rice University in Houston. He founded the Texas Film Commission and became its first director in 1971.
        Mr. Skaaren is survived by his wife, Helen, and his parents, Morris and Pearl Skaaren of Rochester.
