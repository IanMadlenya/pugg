        He was active in the Sugar Association Inc., the Sugar Research Foundation, and Sugar Information, Inc., in Manhattan, and the International Sugar Research Foundation in Bethesda, Md. From 1950 to 1968 he was adviser to United States delegations at international sugar conferences.
        He graduated from the University of Nebraska and then received a law degree from Harvard University in 1929. From 1945 to 1946 he was president of the Federal Bar Association.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Virginia Saalfield Shields; two daughters, Jane Louise of Gualala, Calif., and Sarah Lowe of Dickerson, Md.; and a granddaughter.
