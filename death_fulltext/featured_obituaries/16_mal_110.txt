        John Kennedy, who directed the productions of the St. Louis Municipal Opera from 1941 to 1967, died last Friday in Vancouver, British Columbia, after a brief illness. He was 90 years old.
        Mr. Kennedy was born into a theatrical family in New York City. Before concentrating his efforts in St. Louis, he was best known for his productions of Broadway musicals staged all over the United States as well as in New York.
        Among Mr. Kennedy's Broadway productions were ''Mexican Hayride,'' ''Up in Central Park'' and the ''Ziegfeld Follies.'' His productions in St. Louis - held in the city's 12,000-seat open air theater - numbered in the hundreds. Most were musicals, with a scattering of operas to go with them. At one point in the 1930's, Mr. Kennedy was a stage manager for Irving Berlin.
        He is survived by a daughter, a stepson and stepdaughter, and a grandaughter. Mr. Kennedy's wife, Mary Stevenson, who was an actress, died in 1977.
