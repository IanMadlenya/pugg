        Helen Dudar, a prolific New York journalist and freelance writer on cultural subjects, died on Aug. 1 at Cabrini Hospice in Manhattan. She was 78.
        The cause was metastatic breast cancer, her husband, Peter L. Goldman, said.
        Ms. Dudar, who grew up on Long Island, started her career at Newsday before working for The New York Post for more than 25 years as a general-assignment reporter, beginning in the early 1950's. She then wrote for The Daily News before becoming a freelance writer for many newspapers and magazines.
        She often wrote for the Sunday Arts & Leisure section of The New York Times and for The Wall Street Journal. Her work also appeared in Smithsonian magazine, Esquire, Newsweek, American Film, Connoisseur and Art in America.
        Besides her husband of 41 years, a Newsweek contributing editor, Ms. Dudar's survivors include her sister, Nancy Gallanty, of the Bronx.
