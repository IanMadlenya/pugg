        Ralph G. Gulley, founder and first dean of the School of Architecture at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., died of heart failure on Sunday at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Gulley received an undergraduate degree from the University of Virginia, and a master's degree from Harvard University.
        He established the School of Architecture at Rensselaer in 1929, and remained at the school until 1941. From 1943 to 1952 he was a partner in Deskey Associates Inc., a Manhattan architectural firm.
        In 1956 Mr. Gulley joined the Manhattan architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, where he was a project manager. He remained there until the mid-1970's, when he became an independent zoning consultant.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Faith Hudson; four sons, Philip, of Boston, Kenneth, of Garrison, N.Y., Bart, of Jackson Heights, Queens, and Eric, of Cleveland, and five grandchildren.
