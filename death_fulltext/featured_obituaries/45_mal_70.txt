        Sabyasachi Mukharji, the Chief Justice of India's Supreme Court, has died in London of heart-related complications, the authorities here said today. He was 63 years old.
        Justice Mukharji, who court officials said died on Sept. 25, had a legal career spanning four decades.
        He was a lawyer in London after graduating with honors in economics from Calcutta University in 1946. He was general secretary of the Indian Socialist Group from 1948 to 1949.
        On his return from London in 1949, Mr. Mukharji was appointed to the Calcutta High Court.
        In 1982 was appointed member of the Government's Finance Commission.
        He became a member of the Supreme Court in April 1983 and in the same year was appointed Chief Justice of the Calcutta High Court.
        Fifteen days after his appointment as acting Chief Justice of the Calcutta High Court, he was appointed a judge of the Supreme Court of India. Six years later, on Dec. 18, 1989, he was appointed Chief Justice of India.
        Mr. Mukharji died on his way back to India after attending a conference of chief appellate judges in Washington last month. His death has further delayed judicial action in the case of the toxic gas leak at Bhopal in 1984.
        He is survived by his wife and a daughter.
