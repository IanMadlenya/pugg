        James H. Stallings, a retired Government soil scientist who helped develop no-tillage farming, died of pneumonia Wednesday at a nursing home in Bethesda. He was 98 years old.
        Mr. Stallings, a graduate of Texas A&M University, served with the Soil Conservation Service, part of the Agriculture Department, from 1934 until retirement in 1962. He wrote two textbooks.
        In no-tillage farming, which has been recommended by the service since the 1970's, the farmer leaves the crop residue on the land, controlling weeds with herbicides, and plants the next crop through it.
        The residue protects the land against erosion by wind and rain. The method is now used by a quarter of the farms in the United States.
        Mr. Stallings is survived by a son, Dr. James H. Stallings Jr. of Potomac, Md., and five grandchildren.
