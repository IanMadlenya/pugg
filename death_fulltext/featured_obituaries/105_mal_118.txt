        William Ellis, an educator who helped develop national strategies for working with children with dyslexia and other learning impairments, died on Thursday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 55 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer, according to the New York-based National Center for Learning Disabilities, for which he served as director of professional services since 1991.
        Mr. Ellis organized programs at the various schools he taught at and at a national level, including an educational program for Head Start teachers.
        He was a native of Godalming, Surrey, England, and received degrees from Southampton University in England and Johns Hopkins University. He came to the field when dyslexia was relatively unexplored and lobbied to make Washington aware of the impairments.
        Mr. Ellis is survived by his wife, Jill, of St. Petersburg, Fla.; a daughter, Heidi Ellis of Tampa, Fla.; a son, Timothy, of Winter Haven, Fla., and his parents, Vera and William, who live in England.
