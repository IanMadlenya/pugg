        Brian P. Gettings, a former United States Attorney who helped draft national anti-racketeering legislation, died on Wednesday at his home in Annandale, Va. He was 61.
        The cause was throat cancer, said Harvey B. Cohen, a fellow senior partner in the Cohen, Gettings, Dunham & Harrison firm in Arlington, Va.
        Mr. Gettings served as United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia from 1969 to 1974. Earlier in the 1960's, he was a counsel and staff director of the House Republican Conference Task Force on Crime and a consultant to the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration.
        During that period, he worked on drafting what became the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Commonly referred to as RICO, the law has been used extensively to fight white-collar crime and corruption.
        Born on Long Island, Mr. Gettings graduated from the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass., and received a law degree in 1962 at Georgetown University.
        At Cohen, Gettings, he concentrated on litigation, civil law, criminal law and business-crimes law. In the late 1970's, he helped defend high officials of the Federal Bureau of Investigation who were accused of having authorized break-ins against anti-war militants in the Nixon Administration.
        A prominent client was W. Mark Felt, former acting associate director of the agency, and its No. 2 man. Mr. Felt, who spent 31 years with the bureau, was convicted of conspiracy to violate the constitutional rights of citizens whose homes were broken into. Mr. Felt was fined by a Federal judge, but President Ronald Reagan pardoned him and a co-defendant.
        Mr. Gettings's survivors include his wife, Mary Morrison Gettings, and three children, Christopher, of Toronto, Andrea, of Annandale, and John, of New York.
