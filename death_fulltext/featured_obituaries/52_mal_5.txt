        Ken Curtis, a singer and actor who played the scruffy deputy Festus on the television series "Gunsmoke," died in his sleep on Sunday at his home. He was 74 years old.
        His death was attributed to natural causes, said A. C. Lyle, a producer at Paramount Studios.
        Mr. Curtis played Festus Haggin, sidekick to Marshal Matt Dillon, from 1964 to 1975, when the series ended. He replaced Dennis Weaver, who played Chester Goode before leaving the show after nine years.
        Mr. Curtis also played character roles in some classic films, including "The Searchers" and "The Quiet Man," both with John Wayne.
        Mr. Curtis, whose real name was Curtis Gates, was born in Lamar, Colo. He was a sheriff's son and worked on a jail farm as a boy. He made his debut in show business in the 1930's as a singer with swing bands and joined the Tommy Dorsey band when Frank Sinatra left to begin a solo career.
        After he recorded "Tumbling Tumbleweeds," Columbia Pictures signed him as a singing cowboy. He then joined the western singing group Sons of the Pioneers, which included Roy Rogers.
        His other films included "The Alamo," "How the West Was Won," "Mr. Roberts" and "Cheyenne Autumn." He also appeared in the television series "Rawhide," "Perry Mason" and "Have Gun, Will Travel."
        He is survived by his wife and two children.
