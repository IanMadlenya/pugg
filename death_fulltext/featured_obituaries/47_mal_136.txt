        Ed Parker, the owner of an international chain of karate schools, died of a heart attack on Saturday after arriving at the Honolulu Airport. He was 59 years old and lived in Pasadena, Calif.
        Mr. Parker, a native of Hawaii, earned a black belt in karate and moved to California, where he became one of the first to teach karate on the mainland.
        For 27 years he staged an annual karate tournament in Long Beach, Calif. At the 1964 tournament he introduced Bruce Lee, who later became a star of martial arts films.
        His students included Elvis Presley, for whom he was a bodyguard for 12 years; Natalie Wood, and Blake Edwards, the producer, who featured Mr. Parker in one of the "Pink Panther" movies.
        Mr. Parker also was a martial arts expert for many films.
        He is survived by his wife, Leilani, and five children.
