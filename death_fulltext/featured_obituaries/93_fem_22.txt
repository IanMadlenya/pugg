        Kathleen L. Schwaninger, an advocate for the disabled who played a critical role in the decade-long effort to close down the Willowbrook State School for the mentally retarded on Staten Island and who went on to help found an agency to aid seriously ill children, died Sunday in a plane crash in Hyannis, Mass. She was 50 and lived in Brooklyn and East Falmouth, Mass.
        Ms. Schwaninger became executive director of the Willowbrook Review Panel in 1978, three years after it was created under a Federal court order to monitor the release of residents of Willowbrook into community settings. Willowbrook was then the state's largest treatment center for the mentally retarded, and the panel was criticized for its oversight of the process, which included placing residents in smaller institutions within the community. The seven-member panel was dissolved in 1980 after Albany cut off its financing.
        In 1981, she became deputy director of the Massachusetts Commission of Retardation, working to remove the retarded from institutions. From 1982 to 1987, she headed the nonprofit agency Working Organization for Retarded Citizens in Queens, which put handicapped people in group homes.
        She left the agency to join SKIP, Sick Kids Need Involved People, of New York, which she helped to found. She was its chief executive director for the last six years. The agency advises more than 2,000 clients on equipment, services and benefits for people with developmental disabilities.
        Born in Omaha, she received her undergraduate and master's degrees from the University of Nebraska. She was involved in mental health work in Nebraska and was a former executive director of the state Office of Mental Retardation.
        She is survived by a son, Jason M. Anderson of Boca Raton, Fla.; a daughter, Amy J. Anderson of East Falmouth; a stepdaughter, Sherri O'Grady of Boston; a sister, Pat Hodges of Ashland, Neb., and three grandchildren.
