        Stephen H. Whitmore, a partner with the New York law firm of Berlack, Israels & Liberman, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 39.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Whitmore began his legal career with the New York law firm of Hughes, Hubbard & Reed in 1979, shortly after graduating magna cum laude from the University of Michigan School of Law.
        He later worked at the law firm of Strook & Strook & Lavan in New York, and then joined Berlack, Israels in 1988. He specialized in corporate finance and securities law there and worked on several large corporate transactions, including the corporate restructurings of the Seaman Furniture Company and SCI Television Inc.
        He was born in Columbus, Ohio, and graduated summa cum laude from Vanderbilt University in 1976.
        He is survived by his wife, Lisa Weiss, also a lawyer; his mother, Bertha Whitmore, and a sister, Ann Hanzlik, both of Pickerington, Ohio.
