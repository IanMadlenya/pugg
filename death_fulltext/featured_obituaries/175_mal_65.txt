        George O'Toole, a novelist and historian who specialized in the history of American espionage, died on Aug. 10 at a hospital in Bronxville, N.Y. He was 64 and lived in Mount Vernon.
        The cause was diabetes, said his wife, Mary Ann Werntz.
        Mr. O'Toole, who worked for the Central Intelligence Agency from 1966 to 1969, was the author of the  Encyclopedia of American Intelligence and Espionage; ''Honorable Treachery,'' a history of American intelligence; and ''The Spanish War: An American Epic, 1898,'' a Pulitzer Prize nominee. His novels include  ''An Agent on the Other Side'' and ''The Cosgrove Report.''
        He is survived by his wife, and a sister, Mary O'Toole, of Yonkers.
