        Dr. Leonard J. Goldwater, a professor of medicine emeritus at Columbia and Duke Universities, died yesterday at the University of North Carolina Memorial Hospital, in Chapel Hill, N.C. He was 89 years old and lived in Chapel Hill.
        Dr. Goldwater died of cancer, said Debbie Selinsky, a spokeswoman for Duke University.
        Dr. Goldwater's career spanned 60 years. He specialized in occupational medicine during the 1930's and 1940's, first with the New York State Department of Labor and then the United States Navy. In the 1950's he established the Bellevue Hospital cardiac rehabilitation clinic, which became a national prototype.
        Dr. Goldwater was born in Manhattan, where his father was a physician. He received a medical degree from the New York University College of Medicine in 1928, which was then known as University and Bellevue Hospital College of Medicine.
        After World War II he became a professor of industrial hygiene at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. In 1970 he joined the Duke University Medical Center, where he organized the medical school's occupational medicine program. He retired from Duke in the mid-1970's.
        In 1988 the medical center established the Leonard J. and Margaret F. Goldwater Professorship, the first endowed chair in occupational medicine in the United States, to honor Dr. Goldwater and his wife, who survives him.
