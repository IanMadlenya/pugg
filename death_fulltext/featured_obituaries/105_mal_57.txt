        Dr. John T. Patten, a New York child psychiatrist and family therapist associated with the Ackerman Institute for Family Therapy since 1978, died on Oct. 4 at Roosevelt Hospital. He was 48 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was AIDS, Laura Markowitz, a friend and colleague, said.
        Dr. Patten, who wrote and spoke about his field, also worked in pediatric psychiatry at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and in the family-therapy training program at Cornell Medical School. At Ackerman, he was medical director of the institute's AIDS Project and created an interdisciplinary clinical and research group to examine the concerns of families of homosexuals.
        Born in Australia, he graduated from the University of Melbourne Medical School, studied psychiatry at New York University Medical School and trained in  child psychiatry at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. In the last year he helped to begin and was senior editor of In the Family, a therapy-oriented magazine for homosexuals and their relatives.
        Dr. Patten is survived by his mother, Frances Patten, of Bendigo, Australia.
