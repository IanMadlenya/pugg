        John Remme, an actor, singer and cabaret performer, died on Saturday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 56 years old.
        He died of AIDS, said Suzanne Smith, a friend.
        Mr. Remme was born in Fargo, N.D., and came to New York City in the 1950's to pursue a theatrical career. He specialized in comedic character roles, appearing on Broadway in shows including "The Ritz," "The Royal Family," "Can-Can" and the 1989 revival of "Gypsy." He also acted in productions at a number of regional theaters, including Arena Stage in Washington and the Yale Repertory Theater, and performed in 19 productions at the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Conn.
        He made his last New York appearance in April as Senex in the York Theater production of "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum," for which he received a Drama Desk nomination.
        He is survived by a sister, Audrey M. Roseland of Palm Desert, Calif.
