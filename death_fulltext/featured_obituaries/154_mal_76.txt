        Charles E. Odegaard, who was president of the University of Washington during years when it expanded greatly, and was a nationally prominent expert on education in the health sciences, died on Nov. 14 at his home in Seattle. He was 88.
        Dr. Odegaard, whose doctorate was in medieval history, was a dean at the University of Michigan before he headed the University of Washington from 1958 to 1973.
        In those years the university's enrollment rose, despite some notable campus unrest, to 34,000 from 16,000. Its two-year operating budget soared to almost $400 million from roughly $37 million. Thirty-five buildings were added.
        In 1977, the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation issued a report, based on a study by Dr. Odegaard, that said recent efforts to increase the enrollment of minority medical students had been inadequate. The report called for more effective recruiting.
        Dr. Odegaard was a member of the American Medical Association's Citizen's Commission on Graduate Medical Education and the Public Health Service's National Advisory Health Council.
        His writings included the book ''Dear Doctor: A Personal Letter to a Physician'' (Kaiser, 1986). In it he emphasized the need to educate doctors in the humanities and the nurturing of relationships between doctors and patients.
        Dr. Odegaard was born in Chicago Heights, Ill. He received a bachelor's degree from Dartmouth in 1932 and a doctorate from Harvard in 1937.
        His wife, Elizabeth, died in 1980.
        He is survived by a daughter, Mary Ann Quarton, who lives near Seattle; and four grandchildren.
