        Edward T. O'Toole, a former bank vice president and a retired financial writer and communications consultant, died on Wednesday at his home in Bronxville, N.Y. He was 75.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        A native of Brooklyn, Mr. O'Toole worked in the public relations department of the Chase National Bank in New York, before joining The New York Times as a financial reporter in 1961. He also was an economics correspondent in Brussels, covering the European Common Market.
        In the late 1960's, he was vice president and director of corporate communications for Chemical Bank. He left the bank to form his own company, Edward T. O'Toole Associates, a consulting firm with corporate clients in the securities industry.
        His book "The New World of Banking" appeared in 1965.
        Mr. O'Toole is survived by his wife of 33 years, Susan Brennan O'Toole; a daughter, Ellen; a son, Edmund, and a granddaughter, all of Bronxville; and two brothers, John and Robert of Smyrna Beach, Fla.
