        Rear Adm. Wreford G. Chapple, whose World War II submarine heroics became material for books and a television series, died Monday at his home. He was 83 years old.
        The cause of death was not disclosed.
        The naval officer was a commander in the submarine service when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Soon afterward his submarine, USS-38, sank the transport Haro Maru, one of the first Japanese ships sunk in the Pacific theater.
        Commander Chapple was also once sent to pick up Gen. Douglas MacArthur but did not complete that mission because on the way he sank a Japanese attack ship in Tyabias Bay, near Mindanao in the Philippines.
        Admiral Chapple was awarded two Navy Crosses, three Silver Stars, a Bronze Star and many campaign medals.
        His exploits are featured in naval history books and provided much of the material for the 1950's television series "The Silent Service."
        Admiral Chapple commanded the heavy cruiser Pittsburgh in the Korean War. He retired in 1959.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary; a son, Michael, and four grandchildren.
