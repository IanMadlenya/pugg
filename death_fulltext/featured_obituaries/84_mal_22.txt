        Warren E. Abrams, a paper and printing executive, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 65.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Bobbie Abrams.
        Mr. Abrams joined the Hudson Pulp and Paper Corporation in Manhattan in 1953 and retired from it as executive vice president when the company was sold in 1979. In later years he was the senior vice president of Abrams & Company of Waterbury, Conn., a producer of educational materials for children.
        He was a graduate of Virginia Polytechnic Institute.
        Mr. Abrams is survived by his wife; a son, Alan, of Edgewater, N.J.; a daughter, Carolyn, of Brooklyn; a brother, Richard I., of Washington, Conn.; a sister, Muriel Washer of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.
