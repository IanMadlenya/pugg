        Daniel Sanchez Flores, a political cartoonist, known throughout Latin America by his penname, Roger, has died of cancer, the newspaper Barricada reported Monday. He was 30.
        The newspaper, a pro-Sandinista publication in which Mr. Sanchez's incisive cartoons ran, carried an article about his death Sunday with a banner headline proclaiming, "National Humor Is in Mourning."
        Mr. Sanchez directed the weekly humor sheet La Semana Comica, wrote several comic books and contributed to various newspapers, including the pro-Government La Prensa.
        Considered an irreverent leftist, iconoclast and eroticist, Mr. Sanchez's cartoons made him a controversial figure.
        He condemned double standards, bureaucracy and authoritarians. He admired the Sandinista revolution, but criticized it for its shortcomings.
        Mr. Sanchez is survived by his wife, Marta, and their son, Lucas.
