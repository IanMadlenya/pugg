        David Garvey, a pianist best known for his collaborations with Leontyne Price and other performers, died on Tuesday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. He was 72 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was heart failure, said David Targ, his lawyer and friend.
        Active as a performer to the time of his death, Mr. Garvey was preparing to travel to the West Coast to accompany Ms. Price when he was hospitalized on Tuesday.
        Mr. Garvey was born in Reading, Pa., and studied piano with Beveridge Webster at the Juilliard School, from which he graduated in 1948.
        He met Ms. Price during her time at Juilliard and performed and recorded steadily with her, beginning in 1953. He accompanied her at the White House and on tours abroad.
        He also worked at various times with the singers Jennie Tourel, Lucia Popp and Hermann Prey, the violinists Michael Rabin, Joseph Fuchs and Itzhak Perlman, and others. In addition, he taught at the University of Texas at Austin since 1976.
        Mr. Garvey developed a specialty in American music and also explored the byways of the European repertory, collaborating with Thruston Johnson, a violinist, in a five-year study of Scandinavian music.
        "Accompanist," in its conventional sense, is often a paltry characterization of what the best piano collaborators contribute to a vocal or chamber recital, and more often than not, accompanists have to content themselves with mere mention or a one-word review. For Mr. Garvey, the word was generally along the lines of "strong," "sensitive," "superb" or "exemplary." Occasionally, a critic would break the mold, as Ross Parmenter did in 1956, noting in The New York Times that Mr. Garvey, performing with David Davis, a young violinist, "was such an expert and knowing musician that the event resembled an evening of chamber music."
        He is survived by a brother, John Charles Garvey, of Urbana, Ill.
