        John Kelly, president of the Office and Professional Employees International Union, A.F.L.-C.I.O., died on Thursday at his office in the union's Manhattan headquarters. Mr. Kelly, who lived in Tenafly, N.J., was 66.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Gwen Wells, a spokeswoman for the union.
        Mr. Kelley spent his entire professional career in the labor movement, starting at the age of 18 as an organizer for the Retail Clerks International Union in New York in 1946. After serving as a sergeant in the Army during the Korean War, he joined the office-workers' union as an organizer in 1952.
        Mr. Kelly rose through the union's management and became its president in 1980. During his career the union grew to represent 130,000 predominately white-collar workers in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico.
        He is survived by his wife, Louise; two daughters, Polly Zurlini of Tenafly and Julie Kelly of Boston, and a son, Adam, of Demarest, N.J.
