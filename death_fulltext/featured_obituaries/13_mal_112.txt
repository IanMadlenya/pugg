        Jay Leyda, a film historian and professor of cinema studies at New York University, died of heart failure Monday at the New York University Medical Center. He was 78 years old.
        Mr. Leyda studied with Sergei Eisenstein, the Soviet director, in the mid-1930's at the Moscow State Film School. When he returned to the United States in 1936 to become an assistant film curator at the Museum of Modern Art, he brought the only complete print of Eisenstein's ''Battleship Potemkin.'' He translated Eisenstein's theoretical works and wrote many works on early American and Soviet cinema, including ''Kino: A History of the Russian and Soviet Film'' (1960).
        Mr. Leyda spent the 1940's in Hollywood, where he worked on such films as ''The Bridge of San Luis Rey'' and ''Mission to Moscow.'' He subsequently worked at the Cinematheque Francaise, and his years at the Chinese Film Archive in Beijing from 1959 to 1964 resulted in his book ''Dianying -Electric Shadows: An Account of Films and the Film Audience in China.''
        Mr. Leyda worked at the Staatliches Filmarchiv in East Berlin and at the British Film Institute, and taught at Yale University and at York University in Toronto during the 1960's and early 1970's. He came to New York University in 1973, and held the Pinewood Chair of Cinema Studies until his death.
        Mr. Leyda, whose scholarly interests extended to American literature and Russian music, wrote and edited books about Melville, Dickinson, Mussorgsky and Rachmaninoff. He also wrote the libretto to ''Bartleby,'' an opera based on a Melville short story, and appeared in several films about early motion-picture history.
        Mr. Leyda is survived by his wife, Si-lan Chen.
