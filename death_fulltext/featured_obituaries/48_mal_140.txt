        Harry Shorten, a publisher who created the syndicated cartoon feature "There Oughta Be a Law," died on Monday at the Vencor Catastrophic Illness Center in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He was 76 years old and had moved from Rockville Centre, L.I., to Pompano Beach, Fla., in 1982.
        He died of complications of a stroke, a daughter, Susan Proctor of Trumbull, Conn., said.
        Mr. Shorten, a 1937 graduate of New York University, began his career as a writer with Columbia Publications. In the early 1940's, as a freelancer, he created "There Oughta Be a Law," which attracted many fans, including lawmakers who offered ideas for items.
        At M.L.J. Publications, Mr. Shorten also worked extensively on the comic-book character Archie, the bumbling high school student. The character eventually gave rise to a comic-book and cartoon empire of its own.
        In the late 1950's, Mr. Shorten founded Tower Publications and produced comic books and television magazines. He retired in 1982.
        Besides his daughter Susan, he leaves his wife, Rose; another daughter, Linda Lemle Goldberg of West Hartford, Conn.; a sister, Betty Kaplan of Miami, and four grandchildren.
