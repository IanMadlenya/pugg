        Bill Lewis Downer, a music publisher who worked with many of the leading jazz and pop singers of the 1940's and 50's, died on Feb. 26 at his home in Los Angeles. He was 86.
        Mr. Downer rose to prominence in the 1940's as the head of Decca Records' music publishing arm, Northern Music, a position he retained after the company merged with Universal Pictures. A close friend of many jazz artists, he provided material for Billie Holiday, Carmen McRae and Louis Jordan, and worked with mainstream pop singers like Rosemary Clooney.
        The songs he published included Victor Young and Edward Heyman's ''When I Fall in Love,'' and the Debbie Reynolds hit ''Tammy,'' written by Jay Livingston and Ray Evans. He chose several of Brenda Lee's early hits, including ''I'm Sorry.''
