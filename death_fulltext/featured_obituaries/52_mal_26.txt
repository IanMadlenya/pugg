        Warren V. Bush, an independent television producer and writer, died on April 16 at the U.C.L.A. Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was 65 years old and lived in Los Angeles.
        He died of cardiac arrest, his wife, Phyllis Kirk Bush, said.
        Mr. Bush was in the Army Air Forces in World War II and later graduated from Hobart College. He spent eight years with CBS News in New York as an executive producer and developed such innovative techniques used in television specials as interactive test shows and experiments in dialogue, including "Dialogues with Archibald MacLeish and Mark Van Doren" in 1962.
        He left CBS in 1966 to form his own production company and from 1968 to 1974 he was executive vice president at the David Wolper Organization. For the "Appointment With Destiny" series, he produced such shows as "Showdown at O.K. Corral," "Surrender at Appomattox" and "Of Thee I Sing." He then revived his own production company and produced "In the Matter of Karen Ann Quinlan."
        Besides his wife, a former actress, he is survived by two daughters from an earlier marriage, Andrea, of Toronto, and Kathryn, of Manhattan; a brother, Ross Bollman of Deerfield Beach, Fla., and a sister, Cynthia Bollman of Boston.
