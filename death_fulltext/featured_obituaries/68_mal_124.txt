        The Rev. Dr. Alison Reid Bryan, a retired Presbyterian minister who served churches in New Jersey and New York from 1931 until 1977, died on Tuesday at his home in Frenchtown, N.J.
        He died in his sleep, nine days after his 101st birthday, his family said.
        Dr. Bryan, a native of Asheville, N.C., was the last surviving member of the Princeton Class of 1913, according to the university. He continued a long line of Scots Presbyterian ministers and scholars and served with a medical mission in India and, in World War II, as an Army chaplain in Belgium, France and Germany, reaching the rank of major.
        His ministries included churches in Salem, Frenchtown and Perth Amboy in New Jersey. After his formal retirement in 1960, he was an interim minister in several churches in Westchester County and the Bronx.
        Dr. Bryan's first wife, the former Marion Cuthbertson, a Presbyterian missionary from Scotland whom he met in India, died in 1973.
        He is survived by his second wife, the former Edith Fargo; two daughters, Helen Garland of Gloucester, Mass., and Janet Bryan of Berkeley, Calif.; five grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.
