        Lew DeWitt, the tenor and guitarist of the Statler Brothers country-music group for 20 years, died on Wednesday at his home in Waynesboro, Va. His death resulted from heart and kidney disease, his mother said. He was 52 years old.
        Mr. DeWitt wrote one of the Statlers' biggest hits, ''Flowers on the Wall.'' The 1965 composition sold more than 1 million copies.
        The Statlers, four boyhood friends from Salem, Va., achieved their greatest success in the 1960's and 70's as part of Johnny Cash's road and television shows. They won three Grammy Awards and were named the top vocal group nine times by the Country Music Association.
        The other members of the group were Harold Reid, Phil Balsley and Joe McDorman. The quartet started out singing gospel music under the successive names of the Four-Star Quartet and the Kingsmen.
        Surviving, in addition to Mr. DeWitt's mother, are his wife, Judy; two sons, Denver and Bryan, of Staunton, Va.; two daughters, Donna, of Richmond, Va., and Shannon, of Harrisonburg, Va., and a granddaughter.
