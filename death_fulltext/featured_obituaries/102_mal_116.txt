        The cause was AIDS, said his cousin, Elizabeth Beuter, of Fairfax, Va.
        Mr. Wylly, who was born in New York City in 1936, grew up in Coral Gables, Fla., and graduated from the University of Florida in 1958. Starting in 1960, he worked at the Museum of Modern Art for nearly a decade, directing and organizing exhibitions for its art-lending service and also working in the department of circulating exhibitions. In 1966 he started the art advisory service for corporate members of the museum.
        In 1967, Mr. Wylly became a founding trustee of the Studio Museum in Harlem. After 1970, he worked as a corporate art consultant, advising companies like the Bank of New York, the Singer Company, Coca-Cola U.S.A. and Johnson & Johnson on their art collections. Mr. Wylly retired and moved to Chevy Chase in 1990. In 1993, he received a special commendation for his work on the Montgomery County Task Force on H.I.V./AIDS.
        Mr. Wylly's marriage to Molly Wylly ended in divorce. There are no immediate survivors.
