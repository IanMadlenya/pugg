        Hermann Field, who was imprisoned for five years by Communist authorities in Poland and who wrote two novels with his cellmate before his release in 1954, died on Feb. 23 at his home in Shirley, Mass. He was 90.
        Mr. Field, who was arrested while in Poland looking for his missing brother, wrote the novels ''Angry Harvest'' and ''Duck Lane'' with Stanislaw Mierzenski. ''Angry Harvest,'' about a Roman Catholic farmer in Poland who rescues a Jewish woman during World War II, was the basis for a film by Agnieszka Holland. It was shown at the New York  Film Festival in 1985.
        In 1999 Mr. Field published ''Trapped in the Cold War: The Ordeal of an American Family'' (Stanford University Press), an account of his imprisonment written with his wife, the former Kate Thorneycroft.
        He is survived by his wife; two sons, Alan and Hugh; a daughter, Alison; and four grandchildren.
