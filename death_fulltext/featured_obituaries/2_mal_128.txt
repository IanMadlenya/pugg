        John Kloss, a versatile fashion designer whose clothes included the sexy, the sporting and some sensible, go-everywhere designs, died of carbon monoxide poisoning Wednesday at his home in Stamford, Conn. He was 49 years old.
        The Stamford police said yesterday they had classified his death as a suicide. Mr. Kloss had been under severe pressure because of tax problems in recent years, according to business associates.
        Among other manufacturers, Mr. Kloss worked closely with the SLC Fashion Corporation, which manufactured his innovative lingerie designs for 20 years. He won Coty awards in 1971 and 1975.
        Throughout his career, he had several design activities going at once, and his clothes attracted a following that included Anne Bancroft, Liza Minnelli and others in the world of film and theater. In 1968 Henri Bendel's provided him with the John Kloss Room, and he became the first designer to have a boutique of his own clothes.
        He was born John Klosowski in Detroit and originally studied to be an architect.
        He is survived by his mother, Lillian Kloss of Pompano Beach, Fla.; a brother, Lawrence of Clearwater, Fla.; and a sister, Margaret Catalani of Bridgeport, Conn.
        A memorial service will be held at a later date.
