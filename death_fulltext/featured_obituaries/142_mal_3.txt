        Samuel Blum, a writer and a former editor in chief of the Doubleday Book Club, died on Oct. 22 at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 70 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was leukemia, his family said.
        He was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and was a graduate of Syracuse University. A prolific freelance writer, he contributed articles to many periodicals, including Playboy, Esquire, Harper's and The New York Times Magazine. Among his many subjects were television commercials and the construction industry.
        He was also a senior editor and contributing editor of Redbook magazine.
        Mr. Blum also wrote ''What Every Nice Boy Knew About Sex'' (1967), a brief compendium of sexual misinformation given to youths during the 1940's.
        He retired in 1997 after two decades as editor in chief of the Doubleday Book Club. He had recently completed a book with his wife, Cathy, about male-female relationships.
        He is survived by his wife; a son, Joshua, of Manhattan; two daughters, Kate, of Saugerties, N.Y., and Sarah, of Manhattan, and a grandchild.
