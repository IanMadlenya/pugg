        Dr. D. Elton Trueblood, a Quaker scholar, teacher and author, died on Tuesday at the Meadowood Retirement Community near Lansdale, Pa. He was 94 and had lived on the campus of Earlham College in Richmond, Ind., until 1988.
        The cause of death was heart failure and low blood pressure, said a spokesman for Earlham, where Dr. Trueblood was a professor of philosophy from 1946 to 1966.
        He lectured on college campuses and wrote 33 books, most of which were theological and inspirational.
        During the Eisenhower Administration, he served in a newly created post, Chief of Religious Policy, advising the United States Information Agency on its overseas broadcasts and other programs.
        Dr. Trueblood was born near Pleasantville, Iowa, and graduated from William Penn College, in Oskaloosa, Iowa. He studied at Brown University and Hartford Theological Seminary, and received a bachelor's degree in theology at Harvard University and a Ph.D. in philosophy from Johns Hopkins University.
        He taught at two Quaker institutions, Guilford College and Haverford College. Stanford University appointed him chaplain and professor of the philosophy of religion in 1936, positions he held until 1945.
        He accepted a position at Earlham because of its small size, saying that "bigness" in higher education held too many distractions for serious academic study. He founded the School of Religion at Earlham in 1960 and organized a nonsectarian program to train leaders from the laity in 1957.
        Dr. Trueblood is survived by three sons, Martin, of Williamsburg, Va., Arnold, of Gwynedd Valley, Pa., and Samuel, of Norristown, Pa.; a daughter, Elizabeth Derr of Conowingo, Md., a brother, Clare, of Indianola, Iowa; a sister, Ethel Thomas of Escondido, Calif.; 13 grandchildren, and 15 great-grandchildren.
