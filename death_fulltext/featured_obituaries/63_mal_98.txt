        Brian Shaw, a leading dancer with the Royal Ballet in London in the 1950's and 60's, died on April 2 at the age of 63 in a hospital in London.
        Mr. Shaw died after an undisclosed illness of several months.
        Mr. Shaw was known as a brilliant classicist, a dancer who combined classical purity, spirit and musicality. His best roles were the Blue Bird in "The Sleeping Beauty" and the Blue Skater in "Les Patineurs," a ballet by Sir Frederick Ashton. He also originated roles in "Symphonic Variations," "Birthday Offering," "Ondine" and "Monotones," all by Ashton, in John Cranko's "Prince of the Pagodas" and in ballets by Sir Kenneth MacMillan and Andree Howard.
        Mr. Shaw completed his ballet training at the Sadler's Wells School, joining the Sadler's Wells Ballet (now the Royal) in 1944. His first big opportunity came with "Symphonic Variations," which he danced at 17. Mr. Shaw's career as a classical dancer virtually ended when he collapsed on stage at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City in 1967 after tearing an achilles tendon dancing the Blue Bird. But he continued to perform in character or dramatic parts at the Royal, as an Ugly Sister in "Cinderella," as Richard Baxter Townsend in "Enigma Variations" and as a particularly waspish Widow Simone in "La Fille Mal Gardee," a role he also played in the Joffrey Ballet production.
        Mr. Shaw also assisted in the revivals of Ashton ballets throughout the world and was a popular guest teacher. He was appointed principal teacher at the Royal Ballet in 1972 and continued to teach until recently.
        There are no survivors.
