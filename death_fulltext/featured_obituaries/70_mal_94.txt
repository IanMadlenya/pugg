        Carl A. Pescosolido Jr., a California citrus grower and president of the board of Governor Dummer Academy, died Wednesday night in an automobile accident in Dallas. He was 55 years old and lived in Exeter, Calif.
        Mr. Pescosolido gained notoriety by battling against Federal marketing regulations and shipping quotas for more than a decade. During this struggle he testified on behalf of citrus growers at many Agriculture Department hearings.
        Settling in the San Joaquin Valley in 1970, he founded Sequoia Orange Company, which became a major fruit and nut growing company. He was also president of the Tropicana Energy Company, an ethanol wholesaling firm, in Irving, Tex.
        He had been a trustee of Governor Dummer Academy, a preparatory school in Byfield, Mass., since 1970 and president of the board since 1980. On Oct. 17, the academy dedicated its new $4 million field house in his honor.
        A native of Ipswich, Mass., he graduated from Governor Dummer in 1955. In 1959, he graduated cum laude from Harvard, where he was a member of the football and track teams.
        Mr. Pescosolido taught at Morgan Park Academy in Chicago before joining Lido Company of New England, his family's fuel oil business in Ipswich.
        He is survived by his wife, Linda; his father, Carl, of Ipswich; his mother, Evelyn, of Lake Clarke Shores, Fla.; two sons, Philip, of Exeter, and Winthrop, of Cambridge, Mass.; a daughter, Pamela Goldsmith of Exeter, and two grandchildren.
