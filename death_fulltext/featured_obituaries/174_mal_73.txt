        Mr. Wittmann, who retired from the Toledo Museum in 1977, was widely credited with having built it into a world-class institution.

He was also an original member of the National Council on the Arts and served on advisory panels of both the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. He also served twice as president of the American Association of Art Museum Directors and former director of the College Art Association.
