        Charlie O'Hearn, a star in three sports at Yale in the 1920's and the school's oldest former football player, died April 19 in Naples, Fla. He was 99.
        Seventy-nine years after his 52-yard kick against Carnegie Tech on Sept. 30, 1922, it still stands as the longest drop-kicked field goal at Yale Bowl.
        Two other Yale players, Bill Moore and Ed Perks, tied O'Hearn's record for distance, in 1982 and 1990, respectively, but they did it with place-kicks, which are easier than the drop kick, which was popular in the era in which O'Hearn played.
        A kicking specialist and reserve running back, O'Hearn was a member of the 1923 Yale team, which won all eight of its games and is regarded by many football historians as the best football team in Yale history. A letterman in football for three years, O'Hearn also earned three letters in both baseball and hockey, and was captain of those teams in his senior year.
        O'Hearn's 52-yard field goal was the longest in college football in the 1922 season, his junior year. The distance was remarkable because the football used at that time was rounder and far more difficult to kick and pass than the elongated ball in use today.
        Unlike today's place-kicker, for whom the ball is snapped to a holder who places it on the ground for the kicker to boot, a drop-kicker received the ball directly from the center, dropped it straight down and kicked it the second it hit the ground.
        After a business career, O'Hearn, a native of Brookline, Mass., returned to Yale in 1951 and spent almost 20 years leading the university's fund-raising efforts. After his retirement in 1970, he moved to Florida.
        He is survived by a son, Michael, of Naples, and two daughters, Ginger Broadbent of Hamden, Conn., and Peggy Denby of Boca Grande, Fla.
