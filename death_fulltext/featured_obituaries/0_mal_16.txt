        Joseph S. Herrington, chief of the metropolitan copy desk of The New York Times for 18 years, died of complications of heart disease and emphysema Friday at St. Luke's Hospital. He was 58 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Herrington, a native of Indiana, spent his 36-year newspaper career as an editor, first with The Indianapolis News, for eight years beginning in 1950, and then with The Times, which he joined in August 1958.
        In December 1968, he became head of the metropolitan copy desk, where colleagues said he combined dry wit, sophistication and precision in overseeing the final editing of the paper's metropolitan coverage.
        After suffering a heart attack in December 1985, he returned to work but relinquished his position as head of the copy desk.
        Joseph Samuel Herrington was born July 17, 1928, in Indianapolis.
        In 1950, shortly after his graduation from the University of Notre Dame with a bachelor of arts degree, he embarked on his newspaper career as a copy editor with The Indianapolis News. He rose to assistant state editor and telegraph editor before leaving to join The New York Times as a copy editor of metropolitan news.
        Mr. Herrington is survived by his sister-in-law, Ann Houston Herrington, of Culver City, Calif.; two nephews, Bruce G. Neal, of Martinsville, Ind., and James Herrington, of Davis, Calif., and a niece, Suzanne Herrington, of Aurora, Colo.
        A funeral service will be held at 10 A.M. Thursday at the St. Philip Neri Roman Catholic Church in Indianapolis. A memorial service is planned for a later date in New York.
