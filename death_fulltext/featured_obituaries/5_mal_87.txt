        Mr. Deeds, whose father, Edward A. Deeds, headed the National Cash Register Company, helped found Pratt & Whitney in 1926.
        When the United Aircraft Corporation was formed in 1928, Mr. Deeds was elected secretary and treasurer, retaining his titles as treasurer and a director of the Pratt & Whitney Aircraft division, based in East Hartford, Conn.
        He was president of another subsidiary, the United Aircraft Exports Corporation, in the mid-30's, and returned to Pratt & Whitney as general manager. Since 1975, the parent corporation has been called the United Technologies Corporation.
        From 1943 to 1947 and again in 1954 and 1955, Mr. Deeds was chairman and president of Niles-Bement-Pond Company, now part of Colt Industries.
