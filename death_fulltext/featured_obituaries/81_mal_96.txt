        Peter G. Nash, a former general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board and top lawyer for the Department of Labor, died on Tuesday at his home in Gaithersburg, Md. He was 56.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        At his death, Mr. Nash was a senior partner in the Washington law firm of Ogletree, Deakins, Nash, Smoak & Stewart. He started his career in labor law in Rochester in 1963, then left private practice in 1969 to take a job as associate solicitor for labor relations and civil rights in the Labor Department.
        In 1970, he was promoted to solicitor of labor, the Labor Department's chief lawyer. To help enforce President Richard M. Nixon's wage and price controls, he pressed state governments to comply with the Administration's request that they suspend wage guarantees for workers on Federal construction projects.
        A year later, Mr. Nash became general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board, where he reorganized the legal office and made some of the agency's written materials available to the public for the first time to guide industry and labor in methods the board used to mediate disputes. Negotiated Steel Agreement
        He returned to private practice in 1975 as a partner at Ogletree, Deakins. Last year, he helped negotiate an agreement between the United Steelworkers of America and the Ravenswood Aluminum Corporation, which had locked out 1,700 workers in a labor dispute that lasted 19 months.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Diane Engleson; a daughter, Kimberley N. Boyd of Gaithersburg; a brother, Michael, of Pinehurst, N.C.; a sister, Susan Fyles of Rochester, and two grandchildren.
