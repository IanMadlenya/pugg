        O. K. Armstrong, a teacher and journalist who served two terms in Congress, died Wednesday at his home here. He was 93 years old.
        Mr. Armstrong had been confined to his home in this southwest Missouri town since suffering a stroke last month.
        He began his career as a teacher of English, public speaking and journalism. Mr. Armstrong established the journalism department at the University of Florida in 1925 and served as its director from 1925 through 1928.
        A Republican, he was elected to the Missouri Legislature in 1932 and 1934 and again in 1942 and 1944. He was elected to Congress in 1950 and 1952.
        Mr. Armstrong became a member of the editorial staff of Reader's Digest in 1944 and remained with the magazine as a contributing editor and writer until his death. He contributed more than 100 articles to the magazine and was the author of several books.
        He had four sons and a daughter by his first wife, who died in 1947. His second wife and frequent collaborator, Marjorie Moore, whom he married in 1949, survives him.
