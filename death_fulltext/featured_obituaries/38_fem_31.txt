        Dr. Matthew helped to develop neighborhood Head Start programs and other aids to early-childhood education.
        She was born in Manhattan and held a bachelor's degree from Hunter College, a master's from Columbia and a doctorate from Cornell. As a special consultant to the Tennessee educational system in the late 1940's, she developed methods to teach poor children in rural areas. For four years, she advised the Government of Thailand on ways to develop childhood education.
        Before joining the Brooklyn College faculty, she assisted in drawing up the legislative basis for Head Start as a staff member of the House Education and Labor Committee.
        She is survived by her husband, Pierre Dufour; two sisters, Edith Bridwell and Ismay Hawkins, and two brothers, Dr. Thomas Matthew and Dr. Robert Matthew.
