        Daniel Fraad Jr., chairman of the Ogden Allied Maintenance Corporation, died of a heart attack Monday at his summer residence in Newfoundland. He was 75 years old and also lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Fraad was long associated with the Allied Maintenance Corporation, which was founded by his father in 1888 and was merged into the Ogden Corporation in 1982.
        Among Allied's first jobs were lighting kerosene lamps and trimming lamp wicks for the railroads. In 1937, when the son joined the company, it was a small building support service and among his first tasks was washing windows.
        Mr. Fraad took control of the then privately owned company in the mid-1940's and expanded its services. In the 1950's Allied became involved in aviation, becoming a large independent supplier of fuel to the airlines.
        He was Allied's chief executive officer until the merger. After it, he became chairman of the Ogden Allied Maintenance Corporation, a subsidiary of the Ogden Corporation, and a member of the board of directors of the parent company. He held both posts at the time of his death.
        A graduate of Brown University, Mr. Fraad received a master of science degree from Columbia University. He and his wife were both collectors of art.
        He is survived by his wife, Rita; two daughters, Sarah Henderson and Martha Haffey, and six grandchildren.
