        Dr. Kottmeyer served in the St. Louis public school system for 35 years, starting as a substitute teacher in 1935 and rising to acting superintendent in 1963 and superintendent in 1967. He resigned in 1970 to devote more time to teaching and writing textbooks.
        He was the author or co-author of more than 200 texts, and he continued to write until his death, having just completed a simplified version of Mark Twain's ''Tom Sawyer'' for young children.
        More than 225 million copies of Dr. Kottmeyer's most popular series, ''Basic Goals in Spelling,'' which he first wrote 30 years ago, have been sold.
        Dr. Kottmeyer was a graduate of Concordia Teachers College in Illinois and received bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees from St. Louis University.
        He is survived by two sons, William K., of Town and Country, and Kirk, of Federal Dam, Minn; a sister, Henrietta Bade, of St. Louis, and three grandchildren.
