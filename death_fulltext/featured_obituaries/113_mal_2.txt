        Charles Rappelje DeBevoise, a New Jersey naturalist who championed conservation causes across the state, died on Tuesday at his home in Harding Township, Morris County, N.J. He was 71.
        He had a long illness, according to the New Jersey Conservation Foundation of Morristown, of which he was a founder and a former president.
        An avid gardener and bird watcher, Mr. DeBevoise was an original trustee of  the foundation, which seeks to preserve open spaces.
        Mr. DeBevoise's interest in environmental causes started in the early 1960's  when he and other home owners learned of plans to build a fourth airport for metropolitan New York amid their bucolic world of estates and country homes in Morris and Somerset Counties.
        The prospect of jet noise, pollution and clogged access roads persuaded them  to fight. The grass-roots committee was a forerunner in the movement that gave rise to the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge.
        Mr. DeBevoise was also involved in statewide efforts of the Conservation Foundation, which has succeeded in preserving more than 70,000 acres of unspoiled space. A board member from the outset, he was a strong voice in the protection of the Pinelands watershed in southern New Jersey and the Rails to Trails project, which links old branch railroads to hiking and biking trails.
        He was born in South Orange, N.J., graduated from Colby College and received  an M.B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. He retired in 1992 as vice president for sales and marketing at the Filtrine Manufacturing Company of Harrisville, N.H.
        He is survived by his wife of 43 years, Lillie Ryan DeBevoise; two daughters, Jane DeBevoise of Brooklyn and Anne DeBevoise of Toronto; a son, Charles R. Jr.  of Knoxville, Tenn.; a sister, Jane DeB. Cissel of Little Compton, R.I., and eight grandchildren.
