        N. Philip Miller, an engineer who played a central role in designing the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, died of a stroke on Jan. 31 in Columbia, Md. He was 92 and lived near Columbia.
        He was chief of the facilities engineering division for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's first flight research center, which was later named Goddard. In the 1940's, he was on the team that built the aeronautical research installations at the Lewis Research Center in Cleveland.
        Born in Cumberland, Md., he graduated in civil engineering from Pennsylvania State University in 1939. That year he was a surveyor for the Army Corps of Engineers in the Panama Canal Zone.
        Mr. Miller is survived by his wife of 52 years, Frances Bowman Miller; and two daughters, Barbara Miller of Columbia and San Francisco, and Anne Miller-Bagwell of Berkeley, Calif.
