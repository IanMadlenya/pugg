        Elmer K. Timby, an engineer who worked on major projects like the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco and the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge in New York, died on Wednesday at St. Mary Hospital in Langhorne, Pa. He was 86 years old and lived in Newtown, Pa.
        He died of pneumonia, his wife said.
        For 21 years Mr. Timby taught civil engineering at Princeton University and retired as chairman of the department in 1949. From 1950 to 1968 he worked for Howard, Needles, Tammen & Bergendoff, a national engineering firm, as a partner and president of its international subsidiary.
        Besides the famous bridges on both coasts, he helped design and build the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, the New Jersey Turnpike, the West Virginia Turnpike, the Delaware Memorial Bridge, Miami International Airport and the Hampton Roads Tunnel-Bridge Highway Crossing in Virginia. Mr. Timby was also a consultant to Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island.
        Among his innovations was building elaborate working metal models of bridges and other structures to study stress problems and to modify the designs. One model, of a floating structure for the Navy, had a 150,000 parts and in 1936 was described as the most complicated structural model ever assembled.
        In World War II he served for three years in the Navy, reaching the rank of lieutenant commander. He helped design floating dry docks with lifting capacities of up 100,000 tons. They were built in sections and transported to the Pacific theater through the Panama Canal. Because they were wider than the canal, the docks were raised upright and floated through on their sides.
        Mr. Timby is survived by his wife of 65 years, the former Ethel Day.
