        Stuart Linnick, a labor lawyer and former legal counsel of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association of New York, died in Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on Saturday. He was 55 and lived in Los Angeles.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Linnick was a partner for many years in the Manhattan law firm of Phillips, Nizer, Benjamin, Krim & Ballon. He was legal counsel for the New York P.B.A. from 1969 to 1978 and also served as special labor counsel for the New York State Emergency Financial Control Board.
        In 1978 he joined the Los Angeles law firm of Mitchell, Silberberg & Knupp. He became chairman of the firm's labor and employment law department, which represents clients in the entertainment, health care and public utility industries.
        He graduated from the Columbia University Law School. While he practiced law in New York, he taught labor law at New York University Law School.
        He is survived by his wife, Ruth; two children, Mitchell and Cindy; his father, Charles, of Coconut Creek, Fla., and a sister, Marjorie Schlosberg of New Rochelle, N.Y.
