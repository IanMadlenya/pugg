        Grant V. A. Roberts, founder and chairman of Sasco Management in Fairfield, Conn., died yesterday at his home in Southport, Conn. He was 48 years old.
        He died of cancer, his family said.
        He founded Sasco, a consulting and money management concern, in 1986.
        Born in New York City, he graduated from Columbia University and held an M.B.A. from the Columbia Graduate School of Business.
        Before he founded Sasco, he was an executive vice president of Doyle Dane Bernbach.
        He was a member of the board of governors of the Fairfield County Hunt Club. Mr. Roberts is survived by his wife of 27 years, the former Lucy De Foe; two daughters, Blair and Page of Southport, and his mother, Elizabeth, of Fairfield.
