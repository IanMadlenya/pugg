        Dr. Thomas J. King, a retired professor of English at the City College of New York, died on Friday at his home in New City, N.Y. He was 68.
        The cause was lung cancer, according to his wife, Joan King.
        Dr. King, who specialized in Renaissance theater, was on the faculty at City College for 24 years until his retirement two years ago. He previously taught at Columbia University and Dartmouth College.
        Dr. King was a consultant on the reconstruction of the Globe Theater in London and wrote "Shakespearean Staging, 1599-1642" (Harvard University Press, 1971) and "Casting Shakespeare's Plays" (Cambridge University Press, 1992).
        He graduated from Princeton University in 1948 and, after working in the theater for almost a decade, returned to school and received a doctorate in English from Columbia in 1963. He served as a lieutenant in the Army Air Corps in World War II.
        He is survived by his wife; three daughters, Hilary Pulitzer of Okeechobee, Fla., Emily King of Manhattan, and Dr. Mary Letwin of North Adams, Mass.; two sons, Dr. Charles King of Cleveland and Rufus King of Wellesley, Mass.; a brother, William King of Ocean Springs, Miss., and a sister, Elaine Hahn of Manhattan.
