        Robert Parent, a photographer who specialized in portraits of jazz musicians, died Sunday at Sloane-Kettering Memorial Hospital following an operation for a brain tumor. He was 63 years old and lived in New York.
        Mr. Parent was born in Chelsea, Mass., and grew up in Boston, where he attended Vesper George School of Art and took photographs as a hobby. He was one of the first photographers to work by available light in jazz clubs.
        Life magazine first published his work in the late 1940's. After moving to New York in the early 1950's, Mr. Parent worked as a photographer and album-cover designer, building up an archive of more than 100,000 photographs of jazz and gospel performers. His photographs appeared in The New York Times and many other publications; they illustrated ''Jazz Is,'' a book by the critic Nat Hentoff. In recent years, Mr. Parent's photographs were exhibited in Sweden and Canada.
        He is survived by his brother, Donald, and a sister, Marilyn Dekker, of Frankfurt, Germany. A memorial service will be held July 19 at 2 P.M. at St. Peter's Church, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street.
