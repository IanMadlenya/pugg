        Henry Forster, a real-estate executive with Brown, Harris, Stevens for nearly half a century, died Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 100 years old.
        Mr. Forster, who joined a predecessor firm of Brown, Harris, Stevens in 1913, was one of the first in the realty business to specialize in conversion of rental apartment buildings into cooperatives. He became president of the Manhattan concern in 1952 and retired in 1960 but continued to work in real estate, finally retiring from Wm. A. White & Sons, also in Manhattan, in 1984, after his 95th birthday.
        A native New Yorker, Mr. Forster was a graduate of Harvard. In 1917, before the United States entered the World War I, he left the New York Naval Militia to join the French Foreign Legion, where he learned to fly and became a member of the Lafayette Escadrille, composed of American volunteers. He flew more than 45 hours in combat in Spad and Hanriot planes.
        Mr. Forster's wife, the former Helena Fish, died in 1970. He is survived by four sons, Henry, of Mexico City, and Bayard, Christopher and Hamilton, all of Manhattan; a daughter, Sheila Morris, of Troy, N.Y.; a sister, Margaret Apthorp, of Concord, N.H.; 15 grandchildren, and 25 great-grandchildren.
