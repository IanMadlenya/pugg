        David Eisler, a tenor who sang many leading roles at the New York City Opera, died on Sunday at the Park Plaza Hospital in Houston. He was 36 years old and lived in Houston.
        He died of pneumonia, said his manager, Merle Hubbard.
        Mr. Eisler was born on Dec. 20, 1955, in Evansville, Ind., and studied voice at Indiana University. He joined the New York City Opera cast in 1981 and attracted attention the next year with his performance in the title role in Leonard Bernstein's "Candide." He sang the role again in the company's "Live From Lincoln Center" telecast and on its 1985 recording for New World Records.
        Mr. Eisler, who was often praised for the strength and clarity of his voice, also sang in City Opera productions of "Barbiere di Siviglia," "The Mikado" and "Brigadoon." He appeared in the company's telecasts of "Lucia di Lammermoor" and "La Rondine."
        Besides the New York City Opera, Mr. Eisler performed with the Opera Theater of St. Louis, the Canadian Opera, the Monte Carlo Opera, the Cleveland Orchestra, the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the London Symphony Orchestra. He was rehearsing for performances with the Houston Grand Opera when he became ill.
        Mr. Eisler's companion was Geoffrey Westergaard.
        He is survived by his parents, Donald and Margaret Eissler of Evansville, and a sister, Lisa Best of Roanoke, Ind.
