        Lois Wann, an oboist who played in several American orchestras and taught at the Juilliard School and the Mannes College of Music, died on Feb. 23 at her home in Bronxville, N.Y. She was 87.
        Ms. Wann who was born in Monticello, Minn., in 1912, studied the oboe and piano as a child in San Diego and later at the Juilliard School in New York, from which she graduated in 1936.
        When she began her career in the 1930's, there were few women in American orchestras, and her first jobs were with the New York Women's Symphony and the all-women Orchestrette. Hired by the San Diego Symphony in the mid-1930's, she became one of the first women to hold a principal chair in a professional orchestra.
        She went on to perform with the Pittsburgh Symphony and the St. Louis Symphony, and was for many years the principal oboist of the New York City Ballet Orchestra and in the orchestras of the summer festivals at Aspen, Colo., and Marlboro, Vt.
        She also played in chamber music concerts with the Juilliard and Budapest string quartets. As a recitalist, she gave the premiere of Darius Milhaud's Sonatine for Oboe and Piano in 1955.
        Ms. Wann taught at Juilliard from 1936 to 1992 and at Mannes College from 1946 to 1976.
        She also taught at Vassar and Manhattanville Colleges, the Henry Street Settlement and the United Nations International School.
        She is survived by two daughters, Barbara Bodenhorn of Cambridge, England, and Karynn Hatch of Bronxville.
