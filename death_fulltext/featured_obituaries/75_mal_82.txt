        Lieut. Gov. Walter Dale Miller will succeed him as Governor.
        Mr. Mickelson was the son of George T. Mickelson, who served as South Dakota's Governor from 1947 to 1951.
        The younger Mr. Mickelson had a home-grown style, often driving a pick-up truck to work. He was a popular member of the South Dakota House for six years, quitting in 1980.
        In 1989, Mr. Mickelson's teen-age son, David, was charged with a sexual offense after a 16-year-old girl said she had been raped during a party at the Governor's Mansion. The Governor and Mrs. Mickelson were out of town at the time. David Mickelson was acquitted of the sex charge but was placed on probation for underage consumption of alcohol. He and another boy at the party were ordered to pay the girl's medical bills. Served in Vietnam
        Mr. Mickelson was born in Mobridge, S.D., and lived in the eastern South Dakota city of Brookings and the state capital, Pierre. He received a bachelor's degree in business administration and a law degree from the University of South Dakota.
