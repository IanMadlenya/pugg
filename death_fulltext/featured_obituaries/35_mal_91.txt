        Lindsay Crosby, a son of the entertainer Bing Crosby, was found dead in his home in Calabasas, a Los Angeles suburb, apparently a suicide. He was 51 years old.
        The body was found by a neighbor on Monday afternoon. The authorities said Mr. Crosby appeared to have shot himself in the head. A Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy, Bill Linnemeyer, said a small-caliber rifle was found nearby. An autopsy was scheduled for today. Mr. Crosby was the youngest of four sons born to Bing and Dixie Lee Crosby. He and his brothers, Gary, Phillip and Dennis, worked together for a time in a nightclub act, the Crosby Boys, but broke up in 1959. He then went to work reading scripts for his father.
        When his brother Gary's 1983 book, ''Going My Own Way,'' portrayed their father as a stern disciplinarian, Mr. Crosby said he supported publication of the book. ''I never expected affection from my father so it didn't bother me,'' he said in an interview.
        Mr. Crosby was married three times and had four sons. He and his third wife, the former Susan Marlin, separated in the late 1970's.
