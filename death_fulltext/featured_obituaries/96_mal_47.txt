        Vincent Knoll, vice president and director of couture for Saks Fifth Avenue, died on Saturday at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center after collapsing on Fifth Avenue.
        The cause was apparently a heart attack, said Jaqui Lividini, public relations director of Saks.
        In more than 30 years in the fashion business, Mr. Knoll, 55, provided a link between designers and customers. He focused always on the high-priced end of the business.
        Bill Blass called him "one of the unsung heroes of the business who helped make fashion work."
        He was responsible for helping launch the careers of Carolina Herrera and the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes. He had close relations with the leading designers in this country and in Europe. Before each fashion season began, he would take collections from various designers on a tour of cities like Detroit, San Francisco and Chicago. He offered customers a chance to order clothes early and gave designers a signal as to which styles would be successful.
        "He was one of my first customers back in the 1960's," said Arnold Scaasi. "What was so extraordinary about him was his enthusiasm about beautiful clothes -- he had wonderful taste and he knew what the customer would like."
        Mr. Knoll was born in Bismarck, N.D., and grew up in Spokane, Wash. His first job was at the Crescent, a department store in Spokane. In 1969, he came to New York as buyer for Sarah Fredericks, a chain of specialty shops. He was a buyer at Bergdorf Goodman from 1976 to 1981, when he moved to Saks as the buyer in charge of American designer collections.
        In 1983, he was made director of couture at Saks. In 1993, he added designer sportswear to his jurisdiction and was made vice president.
        He is survived by his sister, Jeanette Davis of Everett, Wash., and his father, Emmanuel J. Knoll of Kirkland, Wash.
