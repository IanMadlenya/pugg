        Howard Finney Jr., who retired in 1969 as a general partner in the Wall Street brokerage firm of Bear, Stearns & Company, died on Thursday at his summer home in Nantucket, Mass. He was 89 and also had a house in Montclair, N.J.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Finney was born in Everett, Wash., graduated from Harvard College in 1926 and became a bond salesman. In 1935 he became the first head of the municipal bond department at another Wall Street firm, C. J. Devine & Company. He became the head of the new municipal bond department at Bear, Stearns in 1942.
        He was a former member of the Montclair Board of Education.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Susan Mary Leach; two sons, Howard 3d and John R., both of Montclair; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
