        Gen. Charles Day Palmer, the four-star general in charge of American forces in Europe in the early 1960's, died on June 7. He was 97.
        General Palmer died in Knollwood, the Army retirement home in Washington, said his nephew, Michael Neill. The cause was heart failure.
        General Palmer, whose military awards included the Silver Star, the Legion of Merit and the Distinguished Flying Cross, saw combat in World War II. He served as a major in the British West Indies and fought in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.
        In March 1944, he became chief of staff for the Army's Second Armored Division and participated in the Normandy invasion.
        Seven months later, he was transferred to the south of France as chief of staff for the Sixth Army Group, and saw action in Alsace, in the Rhine crossing and in the attack across Southern Germany and Austria to the Brenner Pass. He was promoted to brigadier general.
        He served in six major campaigns in World War II.
        In 1950, General Palmer served in Korea as commander of the First Cavalry Division. By 1959, he replaced his brother, General W. B. Palmer, as the general overseeing American forces in Europe.
        General Palmer is survived by his wife of 45 years, Eugenia K. Palmer, of Washington, D.C., his son, Charles Day Palmer 3d, of Concord, Mass., and three grandsons, Daniel, Robert and James.
