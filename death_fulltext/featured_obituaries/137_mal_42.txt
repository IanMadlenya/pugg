        Joe Dixon, a clarinetist and saxophonist who played with many of the great jazz ensembles during a career that began in the 1930's and lasted about 50 years, died on May 28 at his home in Oceanside, N.Y. He was 81.
        Mr. Dixon, who was born in Lynn, Mass., began studying clarinet at age 8 and played his first recital at 12. After hearing a recording by Bix Beiderbecke, he bought an alto saxophone and added jazz to his repertory, although he continued his classical studies at the New England Conservatory of Music. He joined the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra in 1936 and also played with Bunny Berigan, performing on more than 100 recordings by the time he was 21.
        After a brief stint with Fred Waring's Pennsylvanians, he joined the Navy during World War II and played with Eddie Condon's band while stationed in New York City. After his discharge, he played at Condon's Manhattan nightclub.
        He also worked with the CBS staff band and with the NBC Orchestra before joining the Adelphi University faculty in 1977.
        As director of jazz studies at Adelphi, he taught clarinet, saxophone and flute and the history of jazz. He also directed the Nassau County Jazz Festival and organized the Nassau Neophonic Youth Band. He is survived by his wife, Betty, and a daughter, Sherry Mandan of California.
