        Gabriel Celaya, a poet and essayist who became a leader of literary protest against the dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco, died on Thursday in a Madrid hospital. He was 80 years old.
        Mr. Celaya died of cardiac arrest after a bout of internal bleeding, said a statement issued by Gregorio Maranon Hospital. He had been hospitalized since April 3.
        Mr. Celaya was born in 1911 in the Basque town of Hernani. He worked as an industrial engineer in his family business before publishing his first book of poems in 1935, "Tide of Silence." Originally known for his lyric poetry, he gained fame as a leader of protest poets in the 1950's and 60's. His essays also strongly influenced younger poets, especially his key work, "An Exploration of Poetry," in 1964.
        He is survived by his second wife, Amparo Gaston.
