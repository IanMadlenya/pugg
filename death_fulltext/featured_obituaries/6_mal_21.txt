        Bernard U. Taylor, a voice teacher who was a former chairman of the voice department at the Juilliard School of Music, died Saturday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. He was 90 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Taylor was born in Olean, N.Y., and served in World War I before starting his musical career. After early teaching and administrative experience in Texas, he joined the Juilliard faculty in 1930 and remained until 1953. He was an early proponent of group voice teaching methods, and published a textbook on the subject in 1936. He also compiled and edited widely used anthologies of classical songs.
        After serving as president of the New York Singing Teachers' Association from 1942 to 1944, he participated in the founding of the National Association of Teachers of Singing, and was that organization's president for two years after his retirement from Juilliard. He continued to teach voice privately in New York until shortly before his death.
        Mr. Taylor is survived by his wife, Ruth Holmen Taylor; a daughter, Jean Lipps, of Stratford, Conn.; two sisters, and a granddaughter.
