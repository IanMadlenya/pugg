        Dr. Daniel J. Levinson, a professor of psychology at Yale University who popularized the notion that men as well as women go through what he termed a midlife crisis, died on Tuesday while playing racquetball in New Haven. Dr. Levinson, who lived in Hamden, Conn., was 73.
        The cause has yet to be determined, said his son, Douglas Levinson.
        Dr. Levinson taught at Yale and its medical school from 1966 until his retirement in 1990.
        He was the main author of the 1978 work "The Seasons of a Man's Life," which held that men go through a series of stages in the course of their lives. He believed that beneath the tumult of men's adult life there were predictable, age-linked periods of relative stability and of transition, somewhat similar to menopause.
        Dr. Levinson had recently completed work on a similar study dealing with women, which is to be published by Knopf next year under the title "The Seasons of a Woman's Life." That work deals with the similarities and differences between men and women as they face major changes in their lives.
        Dr. Levinson graduated from the University of California at Los Angeles and received a doctorate in psychology from the University of California at Berkeley. Before going to Yale, he had been an assistant professor at the Harvard Medical School.
        He is survived by his wife, Judy Levinson; ; two sons, Mark of Hamden and Douglas of Chester Springs, Pa.; a brother, Ferrer Levinson of Griffith, Ind., and four grandchildren.
