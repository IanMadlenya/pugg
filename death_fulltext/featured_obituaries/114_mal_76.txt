        Collin Wilcox, a mystery writer who set most of his 30 books in San Francisco, died on July 12 at his home. He was 71.
        Mr. Wilcox, who died of cancer, made his writing debut in 1967 with "The Black Door," which featured a detective equipped with extrasensory perception. The hero of many of his mysteries was Lieut. Frank Hastings of the San Francisco police, although two of his most recent books, "Full Circle" and "Find Her a Grave," featured Alan Bernhardt, an eccentric theater director, as the sleuth. Titles in the Lieutenant Hastings series included "Hire a Hangman," "Dead Aim,"  "Hiding Place," "Long Way Down" and "Stalking Horse."
        He is survived by two sons, Christopher of Berkeley, Calif., and Jeff of Diablo, Calif., and four grandchildren.
