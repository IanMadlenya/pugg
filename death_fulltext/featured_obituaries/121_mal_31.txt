        C. Bowen Northrup, a former correspondent and editor for The Wall Street Journal, died Monday at his home in Stone Ridge, N.Y. He was 61.
        The cause was cancer, said Diane D. Cooper, his companion.
        Mr. Northrup, a 1956 graduate of Princeton University, served three years in the United States Marine Corps before starting his journalism career with United Press International. He moved to The Wall Street Journal in 1966 as a reporter and later as editor for page 1 articles.
        In 1970, Mr. Northrup was assigned to the newspaper's London bureau, his base for covering Europe, Africa and the Soviet bloc for seven years. He returned to New York as an editor but left The Journal in 1982. He went back to the paper two years later as a senior special writer and retired in 1987 after a stint on the foreign desk.
        Besides Ms. Cooper, Mr. Northrup is survived by his wife, Marsha Torn, and a sister, Lynn Northrup, both of Manhattan.
