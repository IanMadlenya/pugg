        Nat Cohen, a Cockney butcher's son who produced such films as ''Darling'' and ''Murder on the Orient Express,'' died today after a heart attack. He was 82 years old.
        Mr. Cohen entered movies at age 25 and rose to become chairman and chief executive of E.M.I., Britain's largest film producer in the 1970's.
        Under his leadership, E.M.I. produced a series of madcap box-office hits that included ''Carry On, Sergeant'' and ''Carry On, Nurse.'' His production successes included not only light entertainment but such socially aware movies as ''Darling,'' ''Billy Liar'' and ''Far From the Madding Crowd.''
        He is survived by a daughter.
