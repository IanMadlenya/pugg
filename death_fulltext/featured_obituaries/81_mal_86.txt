        Eugene Picker, who pioneered the showcasing of new films in 1962 by opening them simultaneously in dozens of theaters, died on Sunday at Parkway Regional Medical Center in North Miami Beach, Fla. He was 89 and lived in Bay Harbor Island, Florida.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Picker, who was a movie theater executive for more than 50 years, came from a family that was almost totally involved in motion pictures. His father, David, started with a nickelodeon in the Bronx and turned it into a chain of theaters in 1913 that eventually merged with Loew's Theaters.
        His son, David, is a former president of Paramount Pictures, United Artists and Columbia Pictures and is now a producer at Paramount. His daughter, Jean Firstenberg, is the director of the American Film Institute in Washington. Held Several Top Posts
        Mr. Picker was an executive of Loew's Theaters, which owned a large chain in the New York City metropolitan region, for 44 years. He became president in 1959 and later was an executive with United Artists and the Trans-Lux Corporation, serving on its board until 1989. He was president of the National Association of Theater Owners until 1971. He also was president of the Will Rogers Hospital and of the Motion Pictures Pioneers.
        In 1960, the Broadway Association gave him a gold medal in recognition of his efforts in renovating two of Broadway's most famous movie theaters, Loew's State and the Capitol.
        Mr. Picker's first wife, Sylvia, died in 1980. His second wife, Shirley, died in 1991.
        In addition to his son, who lives in Manhattan, and his daughter, of Los Angeles and Washington, he is survived by a brother, Sidney, of Beverly Hills, Calif.; four grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.
