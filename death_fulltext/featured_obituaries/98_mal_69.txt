        Robert Belmont Freeman, a retired official of the Central Intelligence Agency, died on March 5 at his home in Scientists Cliffs, Md. He was 82 and also had a residence in Arlington, Va.
        The cause was a stroke, his family said.
        Mr. Freeman was born in rural Montgomery County, N.C. He was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he also earned a master's degree and completed doctoral work in French philology.
        He taught college French in Tennessee but joined the Army in 1942. He became a counter-intelligence specialist and served as such in World War II. From 1946 to 1953 he worked for the State Department, first in diplomatic-security operations and then in the Foreign Service Institute's language and career-officers' training programs.
        He joined the C.I.A. in 1953 for a tour of duty in Brussels. Returning to Washington in 1961, he held a series of positions dealing with recruiting, training and placement. He retired as Deputy Director of Personnel for Recruitment and Placing in 1975. He was credited with attracting members of minorities to Government service and received the Intelligence Medal of Merit in 1973.
        Mr. Freeman is survived by his wife, Magda Waering Freeman; three daughters, Maria C. Freeman of Berkeley, Calif., Cristina F. Bryan of Arlington, and Luisa Freeman-Farvardin of Vienna, Va.; a son, Robert B. Jr. of Manhattan; two brothers, Dexter of Greisheim, Germany, and Felton of Redwood City, Calif.; a sister, Kermith F.
