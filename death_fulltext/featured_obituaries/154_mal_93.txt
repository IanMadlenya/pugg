        Wallace R. Persons, who in nearly 20 years as chief executive, expanded the Emerson Electric Company from a small regional appliance maker into a diversified industrial manufacturer, died on Sunday in St. Louis, the company said. He was 90.
        Mr. Persons, who was known as Buck, joined Emerson in 1954 as president when the company had two plants and annual sales of $50 million. He retired as chief executive in 1973 but stayed on one more year as chairman. By then, the company had 80 plants and sales of $900 million.
        During the years Mr. Persons was chief executive, Emerson acquired In-Sink-Erator garbage disposals, White-Rodgers thermostats, Brook Instruments and Ridge Tools, the maker of the Rigid brand of tools for plumbers.
        Emerson now has annual sales of $14 billion.
        Mr. Persons graduated from Case Institute in Cleveland in 1923 with an engineering degree and earned a master's degree in engineering and management there in 1932. He later became a trustee of the institute. He joined the Lincoln Electric Company, a Cleveland manufacturer, as a sales trainee in 1932. He was vice president for sales and marketing and a company director when he was recruited in 1954 to run Emerson.
        He was a director of the St. Louis Cardinals baseball club, a member of the Missouri-St. Louis Airport Authority and was a founder of B.Y.U., a joint jobs program that was created by St. Louis businesses, the local Y.M.C.A. and the Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis. He received awards from the Urban League in 1969 and 1971 in recognition of those efforts.
        He is survived by his wife, Helen Persons, from whom he was estranged, and his companion, Kimberly Walker; a daughter, Barbara Wood; two grandchildren, Helen Robin Fisher and Wallace Stanley Wood; and a sister, Margaret Bennett, all of St. Louis.
