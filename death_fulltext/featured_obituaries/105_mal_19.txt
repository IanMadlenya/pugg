        William S. Cox, a well-known yachtsman and sailing innovator, died Monday in Stamford (Conn.) Hospital. He was 82 and lived in New Canaan, Conn.
        His son, William S. Cox Jr., said the cause of death was congestive heart failure.
        A leading match-racer, Mr. Cox skippered the 12-Meter yacht American Eagle in the 1964 America's Cup defender trials, and was runner-up to Constellation, the successful defender. He was the only skipper to win three different swap-boat championships -- in which competitors race in identical boats provided by race organizers -- of the United States Yacht Racing Union: the Sears Cup for the national junior championship (1930); the Mallory Cup for the national men's championship (1966), and the Prince of Wales Bowl for the national match-racing championship (1974). He was voted yachtsman of the year in 1966. In 1974, he received the union's highest award, the Nathanael G. Herreshoff Trophy for "outstanding contribution to the sport of sailing in North America."
        With Bob Harris, Mr. Cox co-designed a breakthrough modern catamaran, the Tigercat class. He also helped in the design and approval of life jackets for the yacht racing union, and he developed the Cox-Sprague scoring system for use in regattas worldwide.
        Mr. Cox graduated from Princeton University in 1935.
        Besides his son, he is survived by his wife, Elizabeth; two daughters, Barbara A. Lane of Westport, Conn., and Elizabeth C. Cox of Monterey, Mass., and two granddaughters.
