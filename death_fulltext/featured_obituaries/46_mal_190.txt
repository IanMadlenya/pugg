        George Nichols 3d, a theatrical producer and a member of the board of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, died on Thursday at his home in Watch Hill, R.I. He was 70 years old and also had a home in Manhattan.
        He died of lung cancer, said his brother-in-law, Timothy Towell.
        In the 1940's and 50's Mr. Nichols produced two Broadway plays: "Small Wonder," a musical with Tom Ewell and Mary McCarthy, and "Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep," a play directed by Hume Cronyn and co-starring Frederic March and Florence Eldridge. His third production, "Salt of the Earth," which starred Teresa Wright, was staged in Boston.
        Mr. Nichols, a 1942 graduate of Yale University, was an ambulance driver for the American Field Service in India in World War II.
        He is survived by his brother, Frank, of Lake Forest, Ill.
