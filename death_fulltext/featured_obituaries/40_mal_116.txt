        Kurt W. Einstein, who since 1960 headed Einstein Associates, an executive-search firm, died of pancreatic cancer last Wednesday at the Rex Medical Center in Raleigh, N.C. He was 65 years old and lived in Cary, N.C.
        Since 1983 Dr. Einstein also operated the Einstein Institute, arranging seminars around the world and consulting on human resources. Among other techniques, he developed searching studies of job qualifications and grueling interviews to test applicants' reaction to stress.
        A native of Stuttgart, Germany, he received a doctoral degree in behavioral sciences from Heidelberg and came to the United States after World War II.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Dorothy Kaplan, and two sons, Peter of Los Angeles and Michael of Levittown, L.I.
