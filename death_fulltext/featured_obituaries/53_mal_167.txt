        Dr. Joseph J. Jaksy, a urologist who saved Jews in his native Czechoslovakia during World War II, died on Tuesday at his home on the Upper West Side. He was 91 years old.
        Dr. Jaksy died of cardiac arrest, his wife, Elizabeth, said.
        During the war, Dr. Jaksy protected more than two dozen Jews from the Nazis. A Lutheran himself, he hid a 60-year-old woman in his clinic and concealed the Jewish identity of several men by issuing certificates saying that they had been circumcised for medical rather than religious reasons.
        Yuval Rotem, a consul at the Israeli Consulate General in Manhattan, said an Israeli medal was to have been awarded to Dr. Jaksy on Thursday, recognizing him for having "risked his life by being active in saving Jews and preventing them from being deported." Mrs. Jaksy is to accept it in his stead.
        Dr. Jaksy earned his medical degree at the University of Jan Comenius in Bratislava in southern Czechoslovakia. He came to the United States in 1948 and some years later entered private practice in Manhattan. He retired about 1985. He was a longtime member of the Department of the New York University School of Medicine.
        His wife is his only immediate survivor.
