        Robert Huyot, an international hotel consultant and former president of the Hotel Carlyle in New York City, died Thursday at his home in Carmel, N.Y. He was 84 and also had a home in Paris.
        French-born, Mr. Huyot graduated from a Paris school of hotel administration in 1928 as the first in his class. He earned a law degree in Paris and studied law for two years at Columbia University, where he also took courses to become a certified public accountant and real-estate appraiser. He became a United States citizen in 1942.
        Mr. Huyot served his apprenticeship at the Hotel de Crillon in Paris in the late 1920's, working in all departments, and qualified as an Escoffier-trained chef de cuisine.
        He joined the Waldorf-Astoria as manager of its foreign department in 1937.
        From 1945 to 1961, he was president and general manager at the Carlyle. Until 1972, when he formed his own consulting firm, he filled similar posts at the Hotel Summit in New York City and with the Inter-Continental Hotels Corporation.
        Mr. Huyot, who had been married twice, is survived by four daughters, Marilise Flusser of Manhattan, Suzanne Matthau of Edgewater, N.J., Nicole Stevenson of Manhattan and Giselle Huyot of Bedford, N.Y.; three grandchildren, and his companion, Patricia Basile.
