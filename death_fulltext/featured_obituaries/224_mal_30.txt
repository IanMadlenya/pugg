        Norman F. Levy, the chairman of the Cross & Brown commercial real estate brokerage of Manhattan from 1976 to 1990, died on Friday. . He was 93 and lived in Fisher Island, Fla.
        He died in Montauk, N.Y., while staying in a house co-owned by his daughter, Jeanne Levy-Hinte, she said.
        To the degree that brokers form a building's character by bringing in key tenants, Mr. Levy can be credited with having helped shape the World Apparel Center, at 1411 Broadway, at 39th Street, which replaced the old Metropolitan Opera House in 1969; Burlington House, at 1345 Avenue of the Americas, at 54th Street, also completed in 1969; and 1 Grace Plaza at 1114 Avenue of the Americas, at 42nd Street, completed in 1973. In that case, however, Mr. Levy represented the Monsanto Company, which was to have been the namesake tenant until the owners signed W.R. Grace & Company.
        He brokered the 1972 move of Joseph E. Seagram & Sons from half of its space in the landmark Seagram Building on Park Avenue to 800 Third Avenue, a 40-story tower at 49th Street, which Mr. Levy partly owned. The goal was simultaneously to reduce the company's expenses and increase its income in the Seagram Building by leasing that desirable space to other tenants, said John H. Benisch, who also worked on the deal.
        Mr. Levy graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx, attended New York University and joined Cross & Brown in 1934. He was named president in 1967. Cross & Brown was acquired by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in 1984.
        After retiring from Cross & Brown, Mr. Levy continued to do business under his own name. Among properties in which he had a stake were 21 shopping centers in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Maryland and Florida and several Manhattan office buildings, including 10 East 40th Street. Mr. Levy's wife, Betty, died in 1987. Besides his daughter, of Ann Arbor, Mich., he is survived by a son, Francis Levy, of Manhattan, and two grandsons.
        A marketing campaign for 10 East 40th Street once urged tenants, ''Be on the N.F.L. team.'' The National Football League asked Mr. Levy to refrain from using those initials, recalled his secretary, Terry McDonnell. He replied, ''I had them long before you did.'' (Ten years before, in fact.)
