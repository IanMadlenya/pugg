        Mr. Stillman, who studied at the Beaux Arts Institute of Design and at the City College of New York in the mid 1920's, was a prolific designer of New York City apartment buildings with dropped living rooms and concealed radiators. His works included many six-story apartment building complexes, clustered around a courtyard, like Oxford Knolls in the Bronx, Park Terrace Gardens in Manhattan and Walden Terrace in Queens. He retired in 1969.
        He is survived by a daughter, Carol Lercher of Ocala; two brothers, Edward, of Boca Raton, Fla., and Robert, of New Rochelle, N.Y.; a granddaughter, and three great-grandchildren.
