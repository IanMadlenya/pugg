        William Roscoe Kintner, a writer  on world affairs and professor emeritus of political science at the University of Pennsylvania, died on Feb. 1 in his home in Bryn Athyn, Pa. He was 81.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        A 1940 graduate of West Point, he served as an infantry commander in Europe and Korea and retired from the Army in 1961 with the rank of colonel. By then he had enlisted in the cold war, working in strategic planning and foreign-policy research.
        He worked at the planning board in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the National Security Council and the Operations Research Office at Johns Hopkins University. He also served as liaison with the Central Intelligence Agency and earned master's and Ph.D. degrees at Georgetown University.
        A political conservative, he advised, taught and wrote many books about nuclear strategy and defense, and international conflict in general. He was among the foreign policy planners on Richard M. Nixon's transition team in 1968.
        He capped his Government career as Ambassador to Thailand from 1973 to 1975.
        He retired in 1985 from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania after 24 years on the faculty. From 1961 to 1982 he served as deputy director, director and, finally, president of the university's Foreign Policy Research Institute, as well as editor of its journal Orbis.
        Dr. Kintner, who was born in Lock Haven, Pa., is survived by his wife, Faith Childs Halterman Kintner; three daughters and a son by his previous marriage, Kay K. Caldwell of Port Washington, L.I., Jane K. Williams-Hogan of Bryn Mawr, Pa., Gail K. Markou of Sydney, Australia, and Carl H. of Wilmington, Del.; 15 grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren. His first wife of 46 years, Xandree Hyatt Kintner, died in 1986.
