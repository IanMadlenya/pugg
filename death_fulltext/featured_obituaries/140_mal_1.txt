        Albert Bela Bauer, who oversaw the construction of public buildings in New York as city architect for 30 years and prompted Mayor Robert F. Wagner's 1965 executive order providing for the use of art to adorn them, died on Saturday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. He was 99 and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Bauer entered the city's civil service in 1936 and retired in 1969 as the director of architecture in the Department of Public Works. He was involved in the design and construction of scores of hospitals, courts, correctional institutions, parking garages, libraries and fire and police stations, including Police Headquarters at 1 Police Plaza.
        Mr. Bauer came to the United States from his native Hungary in 1924 with a degree in architecture, and studied at the National Academy of Design in New York.
        As he rose through the ranks in city service, he undertook the campaign that led to the order that artworks be included in municipal buildings. Mayor John V. Lindsay honored him as an outstanding civil servant, and he was made a fellow of the American Institute of Architects.
        He leaves no immediate survivors.
