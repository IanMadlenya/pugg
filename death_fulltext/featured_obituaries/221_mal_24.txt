        David L. Weld, a biologist who at his death was the executive director of the American Lyme Disease Foundation, died on Sunday at his home in Pound Ridge, N.Y. He was 66.
        The cause was cancer, said Mr. Weld's brother William F. Weld, the former Massachusetts governor.
        David Low Weld was born in New York City on July 6, 1938. He earned a bachelor's degree from Kenyon College and was later director of the Lower Hudson chapter of the Nature Conservancy.
        Mr. Weld's first marriage, to the former Louise Parsons, ended in divorce. He is survived by his second wife, Sherley; three children from his first marriage, David L. Jr., of Seattle; Christopher, of Sheffield, Mass.; and Ashley Weld Taylor of Ann Arbor, Mich.; three children from his second marriage, William, Amanda and Peter, all of Pound Ridge; three siblings: Anne Collins, Francis and William F., all of Manhattan; and five grandchildren.
