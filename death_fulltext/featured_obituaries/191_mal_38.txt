        J. A. Keller, who as head of the Mergenthaler Linotype Company helped it diversify as old hot-type printing technologies were supplanted, died on Tuesday at a hospice in Vero Beach, Fla., where he lived. He was 84.
        The cause was complications after a stroke, his family said.
        Mr. Keller, who was known as Jack, was chief executive of the Mergenthaler Linotype Company in Brooklyn, from 1958 to 1963, when it merged into what became the Eltra Corporation, a diversified industrial company in Manhattan. He served as chief executive of Eltra from 1963 until he retired in 1980.
        In 1978, what had become Eltra's Mergenthaler division was the largest provider of typesetting equipment in the world.
        Born in Baltimore, Joseph Adreon Keller had degrees from Georgia Institute of Technology and Lehigh University.
        Survivors include his wife of 58 years, Patricia Powers; four daughters, Blanid Palatucci, of San Francisco; Patricia Suzanne Hoeflich, of Portland, Ore.; Sarah Walsh, of London; and Kathryn Keller, of Larchmont, N.Y.; three sons, Joseph, of Portland, Ore.; James, of Manhattan; and Christian, of Mountain View, Calif; and eight grandchildren.
