        Mr. Blinn, who was teaching law at the University of California at Irvine when he became ill, began his career as a teacher. He joined Continental Oil's offices in New York and in Stamford, Conn., in the late 1950's, and became a director of the company.
        In 1977 he retired from Continental and moved to Houston, where he taught law at the University of Houston.
        He was the author of ''Legal and Ethical Concepts in Engineering'' (1989; Prentice Hall), which is used as a textbook in engineering and law schools.
        He was a graduate of the Marquette University Law School and received a doctorate from Yale Law School. He also taught law at the Universities of Washington, North Dakota and Idaho.
        Dr. Blinn is survived by his wife, the former Ellen Young; two sons, John, of Fort Worth and David, of Coto de Caza, Calif.; a sister, Virginia Miller of Hutchinson, Kan., and four granddaughters.
