        David Cluger, the former president of Cluger Rayons Inc. of Paterson, N.J., died of heart disease yesterday at University Hospital in Manhattan. He was 85 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Cluger left school as a teen-ager to work in his father's silk-weaving business in Paterson and eventually converted the company's operations to the manufacture of rayon fabrics. He was a fund raiser for State of Israel bonds and a Manhattan real-estate developer.
        Surviving are his wife, Bertha; a daughter, Phyllis Ellis of Manhattan; three sons, Alan, of Manhattan; Richard, of Ringoes, N.J., and Joel, of Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif.; a sister, Bertha Fogelman of Paterson, and 12 grandchildren.
        Correction:  March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Late City Final Edition
        An obituary yesterday about the former president of a rayon manufacturing company in Paterson, N.J., misidentified him and the company.
        He was David Kluger, not Cluger; the company was Kluger Rayons Inc.
