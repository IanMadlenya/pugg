        Former Representative George W. Grider, a highly decorated submarine commander in World War II, died Wednesday at his home in Memphis. He was 78 years old.
        The cause of death was not disclosed. He had been ill for two years.
        Mr. Grider, a Democrat, was elected to the House of Representatives from Memphis in 1964 and served one term. He was defeated in 1966.
        A 1936 graduate of the United States Naval Academy, he commanded the Flasher in World War II. The Flasher was said to have sunk more Japanese tankers than any other submarine. Mr. Grider recalled his war experiences in a book, "War Fish."
        A widower, he is survived by two daughters, two sons and eight grandchildren.
