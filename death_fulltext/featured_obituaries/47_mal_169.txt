        David H. Weiner, a retired judge of the Essex County Courts in New Jersey and a longtime Republican Party official, died on Thursday at his home in Verona, N.J. He was 83 years old.
        He died of cancer, a family spokeswoman said.
        Judge Weiner was elected to the County Court in Essex County in 1966 and served there and in Hudson County. From 1969 until his retirement in 1977 he served in Juvenile Court in Essex. Before that, he had served as Essex County Surrogate for five years and from 1949 to 1959 had served as a judge in the New Jersey Division of Tax Appeals.
        A 1928 graduate of Rutgers University Law School, Judge Weiner had also been acting Superintendent of Elections in Essex County and counsel to the Republican State Committee and to the Essex County Sheriff. He had also been counsel to an assembly committee investigating election fraud in Hudson County in the late 1930's. The investigation led to legislation requiring the use of voting machines in Hudson County.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Blanche Kemelhor; a daughter, Brenda Philips of Parsippany, N.J.; a brother, Nathan, of Deerfield Beach, Fla., and two grandchildren.
