        Sam Kovenetsky, a longtime labor leader in New York, died Friday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 87 and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Kovenetsky was born in Romania on Aug. 12, 1912, and came to the United States in 1920. He left school in the ninth grade and held several odd jobs in the garment district of Manhattan before becoming a stock boy at Macy's department store in 1934.
        A year later, he organized some of the workers at Macy's into Local 1-S of the International Union of Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Workers. In 1939, he left Macy's and became president of Local 1-S. Shortly afterward, he also became a vice president of the union.
        In 1974, Mr. Kovenetsky worked on the New York gubernatorial campaign of Hugh L. Carey. After Mr. Carey's election, Mr. Kovenetsky was the Governor's special assistant for labor affairs. He later became Commissioner for the New York State Unemployment Appeal Board under Governor Mario M. Cuomo.
        His first wife, Hanna, died in 1976. He is survived by his second wife, Betty; a son, Rolf Kovenetsky of Phillipstown, N.Y.; two stepsons, Rick Shain of Voorhees, N.J., and Chris Shain of Vancouver, British Columbia; five grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
