        Alexandra Gardiner Creel, the co-owner of Gardiners Island, believed to be the largest privately owned island in America, died yesterday at North Shore University Hospital in Glen Cove, L.I. She was 80 years old and lived in Mill Creek, L.I.
        She died of lung disease, said her brother, Robert David Lion Gardiner of Palm Beach, Fla.
        Mrs. Creel and her brother inherited the 3,300-acre island on the eastern end of Long Island, which was bestowed on her family by King Charles I in 1639. She was involved in many social and charitable organizations, including the Colonial Dames of America.
        Her death may send Gardiners Island back into the courts. Mr. Gardiner, the island's other owner, and Mrs. Creel's daughter, Alexandra Gardiner Creel Goelet of Manhattan, have been arguing for the past decade over zoning and other environmental issues on the island.
        In addition to her brother and her daughter, Mrs. Creel is survived by four grandchildren. Her husband, James Randall Creel, a retired judge of the New York City Criminal Court, died in July.
