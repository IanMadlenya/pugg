        Reuben A. Holden, a former executive at Yale University who became a college  president in North Carolina, died on Wednesday at Memorial Mission Hospital in Asheville, N.C. He was 77 and lived in Black Mountain, N.C.
        The cause was cancer, said his son Reuben A. Holden 5th.
        Mr. Holden was Yale University's third-ranking executive, with the title of  secretary, from 1953 to 1971, when he began 15 years as president of Warren Wilson College in Swannanoa, N.C.
        Radley H. Daly, the deputy secretary and marshal of Yale, said yesterday, "For almost two decades, he was a key adviser to two presidents of Yale and to the corporation," as Yale's board of trustees is called. Mr. Holden also functioned as chief of staff to the presidents, A. Whitney Griswold and Kingman  Brewster, and to the corporation.
        His responsibilities included overseeing the university's relations with the  New Haven community. He was tested in that capacity in 1970, when civil-rights protesters -- largely from out of town -- held a mass rally on the New Haven Green, a park adjoining the Yale campus, to protest the bringing to trial in New Haven of civil-rights advocates who were members of the Black Panthers.
        Mr. Brewster, striving to avoid confrontation with the protesters, quietly had the Yale campus made open to them and had food given to them there. Mr. Holden handled the arrangements.
        He was born in Louisville, Ky., and graduated in 1940 from Yale College, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and was managing editor of the campus newspaper. He was an infantry officer in World War II and later received a Ph.D. in education from Yale.
        Besides his son, Reuben, of Charlottesville, Va., he is survived by his wife, Elizabeth Walker Holden; two daughters, Grace Holden of Arlington, Va., and Mary Holden Ayach of Black Mountain; another son, George W. Holden of Austin, Tex., and six grandchildren.
