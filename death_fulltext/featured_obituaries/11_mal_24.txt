        Mr. Maw, who was a partner in the New York law firm of Cravath Swaine & Moore, joined the State Department as a legal adviser to Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger late in 1973. Over the next six months, he traveled frequently with Mr. Kissinger on the Secretary's ''shuttle diplomacy'' trips to the Middle East.
        In June 1974, Mr. Maw was promoted to Under Secretary of State in charge of security assistance programs. As Under Secretary, he served as the special Presidential representative at the series of Law of the Sea conferences in 1975.
        In 1976, Mr. Maw returned to his law partnership with Cravath Swaine and went to London to head the firm's office there. He remained in London until his retirement in 1981.
        Mr. Maw, who was a native of Provo, Utah, graduated from Brigham Young University in 1925 and cum laude from Harvard Law School in 1928, where he was an editor of the law review. He joined Cravath Swaine the same year and became a partner in 1939.
        He was a member of the American and New York State and New York City Bar associations and was president of the city bar association in 1954-55. From 1979 to 1981, he was chairman of the State Department's public advisory committee on the Law of the Sea.
        Mr. Maw is survived by two sons, Michael B. and Carlyle Jr., both of Washington; a daughter, Susan deWilde Hykin of Victoria, British Columbia, and a sister, Jean Woodman of Arlington, Vt.
