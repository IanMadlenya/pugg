        Joseph P. Blitz, retired president of J. P. Blitz Inc., a construction and real-estate company, died on Thursday at his home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He was 86.
        He died of a stroke, said his wife, Barbara.
        Mr. Blitz, who founded the company in 1953, shut it down and retired six years ago, Mrs. Blitz said.
        The company constructed buildings mainly in New York City, but also elsewhere in New York State, Connecticut and Wisconsin. The buildings included housing projects, offices, schools and courts and other public buildings. The structures he completed included office buildings at 545 Madison Avenue -- at 55th Street -- and 635 Madison Avenue -- at 59th Street.
        The company landed in the spotlight in 1963, when minority groups picketed the construction site for Harlem Hospital to protest a lack of black and Puerto  Rican workers employed in the construction industry. The city suspended work at  the site until it received assurances from Mr. Blitz, who was the contractor, that he would hire members of minority groups. When work resumed, 11 blacks were on the job.
        Mr. Blitz was born in Manhattan and graduated from New York University in 1940. In World War II he became an Army captain.
        He was active in fund-raising for Technion, the Israel Institute of Technology.
        In addition to his wife of 42 years, the former Barbara Stone, he is survived by a son, Steven, of Manhattan; three daughters, Alice King of Manhattan, Vikki Blitz-McMillan, who lives in Santa Clarita, Calif., and Patti Blitz-Deihl of Armonk, N.Y., and two grandchildren.
