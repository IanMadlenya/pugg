        Frederick DeMatteis, longtime chairman and chief executive of the DeMatteis Organizations, a large development and construction corporation, died on Tuesday at his home in Old Westbury, N.Y. He was 78.
        He had been ill for 10 months, said Howard Blankman, a family spokesman.
        Mr. DeMatteis (pronounced da-MAT-iss) built hundreds of millions of square feet of residential and commercial real estate and public projects in the New York region as well as nationally and internationally. He prospered by putting up housing in New York for military personnel returning from World War II.
        The DeMatteis Organizations, based in Uniondale, N.Y., consists of the Leon D. DeMatteis Construction Corporation, named for Frederick's father, and other units.
        The corporation was construction manager of the 100 United Nations Plaza residential tower, general contractor for modernization at La Guardia Airport in 1996 and builder of the residential Museum Tower over the Museum of Modern Art.
        In 1991, New York City revoked a $1.2 million contract with the company, charging that it had concealed and altered reports about possible ties to organized-crime figures. The next year, however, a State Supreme Court judge ordered the city to stop trying to bar Mr. DeMatteis from bidding on city contracts. She said no proof linked him to corrupt activity.
        Beneficiaries of his charity include St. Francis Hospital in Roslyn, N.Y.
        He was born in Brooklyn and was a bombardier in World War II. He then joined the family business.
        Survivors include his wife, Nancy; two daughters, Linda Langer and Tracy Serko; two sons, Richard, president of the DeMatteis Organizations, and Scott, a senior vice president there; a brother, Alfonso; a sister, Dolly Marconi; and 13 grandchildren.
