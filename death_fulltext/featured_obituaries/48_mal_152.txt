        David J. Carpenter, a defendant in a securities-fraud case in the mid-1980's that resulted in the jailing of a Wall Street Journal reporter for insider trading, died on Thursday at Bess Kaiser Hospital in Portland, Ore. He was 41 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of AIDS-related hepatitis, his family said.
        Mr. Carpenter, who had been a news clerk at The Journal in the early 1980's, was the companion of R. Foster Winans, who wrote the "Heard on the Street" column. Along with Kenneth P. Felis, a former stockbroker, they were convicted of using advance knowledge of articles in The Journal to make illicit profits in the stock market.
        Mr. Carpenter was sentenced to three years' probation for fraud but acquitted of conspiracy charges. Mr. Winans was given 18 months in prison.
        Mr. Carpenter was born in Salem, Ore., and came to New York in the early 1970's. He operated a shop, David James Upholstery, on the Upper East Side and was on The Wall Street Journal staff in 1981 and 1982. He later formed David James Press, a publisher of travel guides and periodicals.
        He is survived by his mother, Marie Davis of Salem, Ore., and by 12 brothers and sisters.
