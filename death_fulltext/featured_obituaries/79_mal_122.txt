        Norman J. Zeiler, a retired sportswear manufacturer and a longtime contributor to charities, died yesterday at his summer home in Westhampton, L.I. He was 85.
        His son, John, said the cause was complications following a stroke.
        Mr. Zeiler also had a home in Manhattan. He was the owner of Blassport Ltd., the manufacturer and distributor of Bill Blass women's sportswear. It was sold in a leveraged buyout in 1983 and Mr. Zeiler stayed on as president until his retirement two years later.
        He was also a member of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission from 1977 to 1980.
        Mr. Zeiler graduated from St. John's Law School. His career in the clothing trade began at his mother's retail store, called Norman's, on upper Broadway. In 1949, he began selling stylized raincoats for his own company, Main Street Fashions.
        In 1980, Mr. Zeiler pleaded guilty to evading taxes on more than $1 million in income over a four-year period, and was fined $10,000.
        A board member of the Police Athletic League, he contributed annually to the league's campaigns to build community centers for poor city children. His most recent and largest gift was for $500,000.
        He also raised funds for the Democratic Party and held various honorary posts in New York City government.
        He is survived by his wife of 59 years, the former Mickey Horwitz, a son, John, and a daughter, Nancy Coplan, both of Manhattan, and two grandsons.
