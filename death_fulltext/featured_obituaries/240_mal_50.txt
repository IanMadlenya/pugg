        John W. Lavelle, the assemblyman for the 61st District and chairman of the Democratic Party on Staten Island, died Wednesday. He was 57.
        His death, at Richmond University Medical Center, followed a stroke, said Marlene Markoe-Boyd, a spokeswoman for the family.
        Mr. Lavelle, a former executive with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, and a Democrat in Republican-dominated Richmond County, took an interest in the poor. He joined the Staten Island Democratic Association after moving from Manhattan in the 1960s, and was elected to the Assembly in 2000.
        In the Assembly, he served on committees for education, mental health, government employees, social services, transportation and veterans.
        He is survived by his mother, Mary Lavelle; three sons, John, Christopher and Danny; their mother, Susan; two brothers and two sisters; two grandsons; and a granddaughter.
