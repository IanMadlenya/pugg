        Glenn S. Dumke, chancellor of the California State University system from 1962 to 1982, died of a heart attack Thursday night at his home in Los Angeles, the university announced today. He was 72 years old.  Dr. Dumke presided over the state system as it grew from 16 separate state college campuses into the nation's largest system of higher education.
        In his 20 years as chancellor, enrollment tripled, including 319,000 students in 1982, and three campuses were added to the system.
        Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds, who succeeded Dr. Dumke in 1982, said, ''Glenn Dumke did something that many people thought was impossible: he organized 16 separate universities into a single system that has become a model across the nation.''
        Dr. Dumke became president of San Francisco State College in 1957 and while in that post was one of the principal architects of ''The Master Plan for Higher Education in California,'' which became a blueprint for the state university system.
        In 1961 he was appointed vice chancellor for the state colleges, which became the university system. He became chancellor a year later.
        Dr. Dumke was born in Green Bay, Wis., in 1917 and moved to California in 1923. He received his bachelor's and master's degrees at Occidental College and his doctorate in history at the Univerity of California at Los Angeles.
        He also received honorary doctoral degrees from nine universities.
        Dr. Dumke is survived by his wife, Dorothy.
