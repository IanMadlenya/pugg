        Dr. Meyer, a professor emeritus of biochemistry at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, was one of the first scientists to recognize the significance of bacterial enzymes as a tool in analyzing the structure of animal tissue components. His research earned him many awards, including the Albert Lasker Medal and the Legion of Honor.
        Dr. Meyer was born on Sept. 4, 1899 in Kerpen, a suburb of Cologne, Germany. He earned his M.D. at the University of Cologne and a Ph.D. in chemistry at the University of Berlin. He came to the United States in 1930.  He taught and led research groups at Columbia University for 34 years, successively in its Eye Institute and Department of Medicine. Then, for a decade, he was a biochemistry professor at the Belfer Graduate School of Science at Yeshiva University.
        Surviving are his wife, Marthe; a son, Robert, and a daughter, Janet Levy, both of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
