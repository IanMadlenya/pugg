        Thomas J. Hamilton, a New York Times correspondent for 35 years who was chief of the paper's United Nations bureau from 1946 to 1965, died yesterday of a heart attack at his home in Heritage Village in Southbury, Conn. He was 77 years old.  Mr. Hamilton headed the Madrid bureau of The Times from 1939 to 1941, the Bonn bureau from 1965 to 1967 and the Geneva bureau from 1967 until his retirement in 1972.
        His coverage included the negotiations that led to the founding of Israel, the 1954 Geneva Peace Conference, the 1968 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia and a series of arms negotiations in Geneva, Vienna and Helsinki.
        In 1941, in a letter from Madrid reviewing his career to that point, he commented: ''My biggest kick in the newspaper business was to be the only American reporter at 10 Downing Street when Chamberlain came back from Munich and announced that it will be 'Peace in Our Time.' '' A Rhodes Scholar
        Mr. Hamilton was born in Augusta, Ga., the son of the editor and publisher of The Augusta Chronicle.
        He entered the University of Georgia as a sophomore when he was 15 years old. After graduating magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa, he spent three years as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, where he received both a bachelor's and a master's degree.
        In 1931, he became a reporter with The Atlanta Journal. Later, when his father became ill, he filled in and wrote editorials for The Chronicle. Three years later, he joined The Associated Press, spending three years in its Washington and London bureaus.
        In 1937, he joined The Times in its London bureau, where he remained for two years until he was sent to Madrid. There he scored a succession of exclusive stories on American aid to France.
        Mr. Hamilton was the author of ''Appeasement's Child,'' an assessment of the Franco regime, which was published in 1943. It was described by Lewis Gannett in The Times as a picture of ''a land laid waste by war.'' A Quiet Worker
        From 1942 to 1945, he served as a lieutenant in the United States Navy. He was later made an officer of the French Legion of Honor.
        At the United Nations, the lanky, six-foot Southerner was not one of the correspondents who demanded the floor at a news conference or who could be heard expounding his views in the Delegates Lounge. Rather, he worked quietly, interviewing and observing the important delegates.
        He obtained a major scoop in 1951 when he observed Jacob Malik of the Soviet Union talking with a member of the United States delegation. Following this up, Mr. Hamilton was the first to report on Soviet overtures for an armistice in Korea. His article was published a month before Mr. Malik made the public announcement.
        Mr. Hamilton won the George Polk Memorial Award for foreign correspondents in 1955 and 1956. He was also co-winner of the Sigma Delta Chi headline award for his reporting from the United Nations in 1962 and 1963.
        From 1973 to 1978, he was an adviser to the Japanese Mission to the United Nations.
        Survivors include his wife, Ethel Mathews; a daughter, Anne M. Hamilton of West Hartford, Conn; two sons: Thomas J. Jr., of Westport, Conn., and William B., of Washington, a sister, Alice Friedgut of New York City, and five grandchildren.
        A memorial service is to be held at 2 P.M. Saturday at Trinity Episcopal Church in Southport, Conn.
