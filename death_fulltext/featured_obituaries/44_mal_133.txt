        Bernard Silber, a former Western Union employee who was convicted of contempt of Congress charges, a conviction that was later reversed by the United States Supreme Court, died on Tuesday at a nursing home in Oakland, Calif. He was 90 years old and moved from Manhattan to Oakland in 1987.
        Mr. Silber, a troubleshooter for Western Union, was called in 1957 before a subcommittee of the House of Representatives that was investigating allegations of Communist infiltration of the communications industry. Mr. Silber, a native New Yorker who admitted past membership in the Communist Party, refused to testify on a number of grounds, insisting on the privacy of his beliefs and associations.
        He was charged with contempt of Congress for his refusal to testify and was tried and convicted in Washington in 1960. He was sentenced to four months in jail and fined $100.
        In 1962, the Supreme Court reversed the verdict, ruling that the indictment had been faulty. Mr. Silber was then reindicted, but a Federal District Court judge in 1964 dismissed the charges on similar grounds.
        Mr. Silber, whose conviction forced him to take early retirement from Western Union, became treasurer of the Cooperative Village Federal Credit Union in Manhattan, a job he held for the next 25 years. He retired for a second time in 1987 and moved to Oakland.
        He is survived by a son, Irwin, of Oakland, a daughter, Helaine Darr of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
