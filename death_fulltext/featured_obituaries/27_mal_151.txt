        Mr. Hine, a native of Milford, Conn., who graduated from Yale University in 1934, became president of International Latex in 1954. The organization, with headquarters in Manhattan, went through a series of corporate changes over the years and today three companies remain: Playtex Apparel Inc. and the Playtex Family Products Corporation, both with headquarters in Stamford, Conn., and Sarong Inc. of Manhattan. Mr. Hine retired in the mid-1960's.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Joyce Brown.
