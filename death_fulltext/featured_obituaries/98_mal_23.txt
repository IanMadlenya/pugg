        Tessim Zorach, an art collector who donated extensively from his collection of pre-Columbian Ecuadorean art and gave from the works of his parents, the artists William and Marguerite Thompson Zorach, died on Feb. 26 at the Mid Coast Hospital in Bath, Me. He was 79 and lived on Georgetown Island, Me.
        The cause was a hemorrhage caused by a fall in his home, said his wife, Peggy.
        He and his wife assembled a major collection in their own right as well as helping to oversee the extensive works of his parents. Some 200 different objects dating from 3500 B.C to A.D. 100 were given to the Herbert Johnson Art Museum at Cornell University. Donations were also made to the Brooklyn Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and the Portland Museum of Art in Portland, Me., among other places.
        Mr. Zorach helped to establish the Collection of the Zorach Children, which oversaw the donation of examples of his parents' works to many American museums as well as to the Pushkin Museum in Moscow. In 1970, he and his sister, Dahlov Ipcar, presented the National Museum of American Art in Washington with a large collection of works by the Zorachs.
        In addition to his wife and his sister, both of Georgetown Island, Me., he is survived by three sons, Timothy, of Carmel, Calif.; Peter, of Wilmington, Del., and Jonathan, of Lancaster, Pa., and four grandchildren.
