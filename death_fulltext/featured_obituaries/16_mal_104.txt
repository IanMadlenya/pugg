        Dr. Hirschfeld developed an integrated medical approach to rehabilitating patients with chronic disability. His theory on the process of accidents, as described in a series of articles he wrote for The Journal of the American Medical Association in 1963, became standard medical practice.
        A graduate of the University of Michigan Medical School in 1936, Dr. Hirschfeld practiced medicine in Detroit for 40 years before moving to San Francisco in 1976. He was a delegate to the International Conference of Stress in Industry in 1970 and served on the medical faculties of the University of California at San Francisco, Wayne State University in Detroit and at his alma mater.
        Survivors include his wife, Mary Lou Wilson Hirschfeld, of Mill Valley; two sons, Robert, M.A., of Bethesda, Md.; Lawrence, of Paris, France; two stepchildren, Dr. James Russell, of Edmonton, Alberta and Roxanne Ryan, of San Anselmo, Calif.; and five grandchildren.
