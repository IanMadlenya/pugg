        J. Howard Marshall 2d, a lawyer, oil industry executive and philanthropist, died Saturday at Park Plaza Hospital in Houston, where he lived. He was 90.
        Mr. Marshall was known for the role he played in the family feud that has been going on for more than a decade at Koch Industries, one of the biggest privately held companies in the country.

A battle between his wife and his son Pierce has been brewing over Mr. Marshall's estate, estimated at $550 million, The Associated Press said. Ms. Smith and Pierce Marshall went to court last February in a dispute over the money, a trust was established and Ms. Smith was largely was cut off.
        Mr. Marshall advised the Federal Government on petroleum issues in the 1930's and during World War II. He was a co-author of the Code of Fair Competition for the Petroleum Industry in 1933 and drafted the executive order creating the National Petroleum Council in 1946.
        He was president of Ashland Oil & Refining Company during the the 1940's, and later became a director and executive of Allied Chemical Corporation. He was also a director of the energy concern Coastal Corporation, based in Houston.
        A native of Philadelphia, he graduated from Haverford College, a beneficiary of his philanthropy, and he received a law degree from Yale University.
