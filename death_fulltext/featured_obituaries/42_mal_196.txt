        Gerald Hedley, described by the National Gallery here as one of the world's leading experts in art restoration, died on Saturday in a mountaineering accident in the French Alps. He was 41 years old.
        The gallery said on Tuesday that Mr. Hedley fell about 200 feet down a rock face to his death after being caught in an avalanche.
        David Bomford, a senior restorer at the National Gallery, said Mr. Hedley lectured at the Courtauld Institute and advised museums throughout the world on restoration.
        ''He was one of the most internationally celebrated people in the whole of the restoration scene,'' Mr. Bomford said.
        ''It is no exaggeration to say his research saved valuable works for future generations.''
