        Donald G. Agger, a lawyer active on international aviation issues, died today at his home here. He was 64.
        The cause was cancer, said Arthur Mason, a family friend.
        Mr. Agger was a United States representative to NATO for four years in the 1950's before becoming president of American Nord Aviation, a French-owned builder of aircraft.
        In 1967 and 1968 he was Assistant Secretary for International Affairs in the Transportation Department. He then founded DGA International, which represented foreign governments and companies, including the British-French Concorde consortium. He played an important role in the effort to secure American landing rights for the supersonic jet in 1977.
        He is survived by his wife, Susan; a daughter, April, of Chevy Chase, Md.; three sons, David, of Baltimore, Samuel, of Silver Spring, Md., and Marc, of New York; two stepdaughters, Lisa and Paula Weinstein, both of Washington; a brother, Robert, of Venice, and eight grandchildren.
