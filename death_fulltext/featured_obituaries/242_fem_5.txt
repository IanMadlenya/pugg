        Edith d'Addario, for 43 years the director of the Joffrey Ballet School in Greenwich Village, died on March 4 in Brooklyn. She was 84.
        The cause was complications of emphysema, said her daughter Diane Green of San Francisco.
        Mrs. d'Addario, known to generations of dancers, students and their parents simply as Mrs. D, began her career at the Joffrey not long after bringing one of her daughters to classes at the school. Robert Joffrey and Gerald Arpino had only recently established the company, previously a touring ensemble, and the troupe and school were a hands-on affair. Mrs. d'Addario answered a ringing phone one day while waiting to pick up her daughter and her fate was sealed.
        She was appointed assistant to Joffrey and Mr. Arpino in 1961 and five years later was named executive director. In 1988, the year Joffrey died, she became simply ''director.''
        As the school's ever-present, plain-spoken doyenne, she also worked behind the scenes to expand several programs, including classes for children, pre-professional training and a summer intensive training project in four major cities across the United States.
        Mrs. d'Addario also established ballet classes for deaf children, helped form several junior touring ensembles and coordinated the casting of children's roles in the Joffrey Ballet productions of ''The Nutcracker'' and ''Petrouchka.'' She continued to direct the school until 2005, when she was succeed by her daughter Gail d'Addario.
        In addition to her two daughters, Mrs. d'Addario is survived by a grandson.
