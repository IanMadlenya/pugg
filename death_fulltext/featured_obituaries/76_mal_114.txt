        James H. Orr, investment counselor and founder of Colonial Group Inc. of Boston, one of the nation's leading mutual fund organizations, died on Saturday at the Massachusetts General Hospital. He was 94 and lived in Boston.
        The cause was pneumonia, said his son, James H. Orr Jr.
        Mr. Orr began his career with Stone & Webster Inc. in 1920 and studied law at night at Northeastern University. After working as legal clerk, he became an executive in the utility and management fields. When Stone & Webster was required to divest its investment subsidiary in 1931, Mr. Orr formed the Investment Service Corporation, later renamed Colonial Management Associates, now part of the Colonial Group.
        In 1934, he became president of the Railway and Light Securities Company, a Boston investment company. This was reorganized in 1954 as the Colonial Fund, the first mutual fund in the Colonial Group.
        Mr. Orr retired in 1975 but remained active as a trustee and financial adviser.
        He was born in New York City. He graduated in 1920 from Harvard. He was admitted to the Massachusetts Bar in 1925. Northeastern awarded him an honorary Ph.D. in 1972.
        His son David died in 1972.
        Besides his son, James, of Dover, surviving are his wife, the former Ida Lee Hayes; another son, Francis A. Orr of San Diego; a sister, Mary Clark of Holyoke, Mass.; and seven grandchildren.
