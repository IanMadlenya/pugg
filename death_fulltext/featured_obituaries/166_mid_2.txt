        Esther M. Stone, the widow of the journalist I. F. Stone, who helped him publish his well-read and iconoclastic weekly newsletter, died on Thursday at a nursing home in Potomac, Md. She was 91.
        She was born in Philadelphia and married Mr. Stone in 1929, after meeting him on a blind date, said her son Jeremy J. Stone. For about 20 years, Mrs. Stone helped her husband publish I. F. Stone's Weekly out of their home in Washington.
        ''She was his main substantive administrative assistant, subscription manager, advertising manager, and chief cook and bottle washer,'' Jeremy Stone said.
        By the late 1960's, the paper's circulation had reached 70,000. Mr. Stone's radical investigative reports attacked government distortions and evasions and fought fiercely for civil rights.
        Peter Osnos, who was Mr. Stone's editorial assistant in the mid-1960's, recalled a sign Mrs. Stone kept above her desk on the porch that read, ''Good News Is on the Way.''
        ''She was absolutely determined to keep that little ship afloat,'' Mr. Osnos said in a phone interview on Saturday.
        Besides her son Jeremy, of Chevy Chase, Md., Mrs. Stone is survived by a daughter, Celia Gilbert of Cambridge, Mass.; another son, Christopher D., of Los Angeles; four grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.
