        Richard J. McSorley, a former deputy makeup editor of The New York Times, died on Thursday at Methodist Medical Center of Oak Ridge, Tenn. He was 67 and lived in Norris, Tenn., since retiring in 1992.
        The cause was respiratory failure, his family said.
        A native of Lowell, Mass., Mr. McSorley attended New York University and joined The New York Herald Tribune in 1953 as an assistant news editor. He held  the same title at the short-lived New York World Journal Tribune.
        Mr. McSorley joined The Times in 1967 as a makeup editor, a position that entails designing the pages of the newspaper and designating the placement of text, headlines, photographs and art. From 1986 until his retirement, he worked  as assistant to the makeup editor.
        In 1971, Mr. McSorley worked secretly with the team that disclosed a secret Government study on the war in Vietnam that came to be known as The Pentagon Papers, and designed the pages of the newspaper in which it appeared. In later years, he participated in the redesign of the business section of The Times.
        Mr. McSorley's survivors include his wife, Nancy; his sister, Ann Campanelli  of Edison, N.J.; two daughters, Donna Draney of Norris and Kathy Moore of Lexington, Ky.; two sons, Donald of Port Washington, L.I., and Douglas of Brooklyn; and seven grandchildren.
