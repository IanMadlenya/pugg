        Harry Nilsson, a popular singer and composer in the 1960's and 1970's who won two Grammy awards for his literate, almost intimate songs, died yesterday at his home in Agoura Hills, Calif. He was 52.
        The cause was heart disease, said his agent, David Spero, who added that Mr. Nilsson suffered a heart attack a year ago and had only recently begun to record again, finishing work on an album last Wednesday.
        Mr. Nilsson won popularity and critical acclaim for a style that was labeled "salon rock," delivered in a voice that was gruff and at times even hoarse.
        His performance was strikingly different from the acid rock that was much in favor during the period, and Mr. Nilsson, a recluse who shunned the limelight and never performed in concert, provided a stark contrast to most rock singers of his era.
        Nicknamed the White Rabbit because of his pale blond hair and light complexion, Mr. Nilsson won a Grammy in 1969 for his performance of "Everybody's Talkin'," a song by Fred Neil on the sound track of the movie "Midnight Cowboy."
        Mr. Nilsson, who was born Harry E. Nelson 3d in Brooklyn, adopted the Swedish spelling of his name after he moved to California and began his performing career. While working in a bank, he wrote commercial jingles and songs for the rock producer Phil Spector. In 1967 Mr. Nilsson signed with RCA Records. His first hit was "Cuddly Toy," recorded by The Monkees.
        He won a second Grammy in 1972 for best male vocal with the album "Without You." Several other albums popular in the 1970's were "Nilsson Schmilsson" and "A Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night." He also won critical acclaim for the 1970 album "The Point."
        Mr. Nilsson is survived by his wife, Oona, and six children.
