        Francis Lund Van Dusen, a retired Federal appellate judge, died Wednesday at his home in Bryn Mawr, Pa., a suburb of Philadelphia. He was 81.
        He died after a long illness, his family said.
        Judge Van Dusen retired in 1990 from the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, after 35 years on the Federal bench, first as a trial judge and then as an appellate judge. He was appointed to the Federal District Court for Pennsylvania's Eastern District by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1955 and to the appellate court by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1967.
        Judge Van Dusen, a native of Philadelphia, graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University in 1934 and cum laude from Harvard Law School in 1937.
        After practicing law in Philadelphia he joined the Navy in World War II. He served in the Pacific, was twice decorated for heroism and rose to the rank of lieutenant commander. After the war he returned to a law firm that is now Dechert Price & Rhoads, where he became a partner in 1950.
        Judge Van Dusen's first wife, the former Rhe Brooke, died in 1976. He is survived by his second wife, the former Margaret Goodenough; four children, Rhe Jain of Mercer Island, Wash., Dr. Muriel Berkeley of Baltimore, Francis L. Van Dusen Jr. of Seattle and Clinton M. Van Dusen of Pittsburgh; a brother, Lewis H. Van Dusen Jr. of Philadelphia, a sister, Alberta Lewis of Washington, and eight grandchildren.
