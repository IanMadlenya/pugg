        Betty S. Cornfeld, a television executive and writer, died Wednesday at the Swedish Hospital in Seattle. She was 44 years old and had contracted viral pneumonia following a bone marrow transplant for lymphoma.
        Ms. Cornfeld was the director of film and drama for the Arts & Entertainment Network, where she was responsible for the acquisition of feature films and drama series.
        At A&E she also created ''Shortstories,'' a weekly showcase for short films. ''I look for films that tell a clear story, that define a place and a mood, and that absorb you in a character,'' she said about the debut of the series in September 1985.
        Previously, Ms. Cornfeld won an Emmy Award for her writing on ABC's ''F.Y.I.'' show. She also wrote for ''The David Susskind Show.''
        She is survived by a son, Alexander; her mother, Nettie Levy of West Palm Beach, Fla., and a sister, Marilyn Cohen of New City, N.Y.
