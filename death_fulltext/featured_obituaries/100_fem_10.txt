        Lola Flores, one of Spain's most popular singers and the star of many film musicals of the 1950's and 60's, died today at her home outside Madrid. She was 72.
        She died after a long struggle with breast cancer, her family said.
        Her body was transferred to the Villa Cultural Center here to lie in state, as thousands of mourners stood in line to pay their last respects.
        Known as "Lola of Spain," or "The Pharaohness" after a role she played in one of her films, Miss Flores came to represent popular flamenco and Spanish folk singing for generations of Spaniards and millions of fans in Latin America. In a message of condolence to her family, King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia said, "Spain has lost one of the greatest artists of this century."
        Dolores Flores Ruiz was born in 1923 in the southwestern Andalusian town of Jerez de la Frontera. At age 10, she began to sing in local bars and taverns. She won national fame in the 1940's, singing with the popular flamenco artist Manolo Caracol, and landed her first film contract at 17.
        She is best remembered for playing ethnic dancing and singing roles, and was often cast as a gypsy or a Mexican peasant. Her most famous films were "Estrella de la Sierra Morena" ("Star of Sierra Morena") of 1952 and "Maria de la O" (1958).
        Miss Flores was convicted for tax fraud in 1991, fined 14 million pesetas ($112,000) and sentenced to 16 months in prison, but was released on probation. ("I don't understand about paperwork," she said in her own defense.) Last year the Spanish Government awarded her a gold medal for her life's work.
        She is survived by her husband, Antonio Gonzalez, a gypsy flamenco guitarist; two daughters, and a son.
