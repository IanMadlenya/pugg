        Donald Manfred Roehrs, a landscape architect who received more than 40 awards for his garden designs, died on Sunday at St. Joseph's Hospital in Paterson, N.J. He was 80 and had lived in Franklin Lakes, N.J., most of his life.
        The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease, his family said.
        Mr. Roehrs drew his designs on canvases that ranged from rocky terrains to formally sculptured lawns. One design, which won a Massachusetts Horticultural Society gold medal, re-created a wooded setting where a dogwood tree reflected off a pool and delicate ferns spread down rocky crevices overhanging the water.
        A rose garden he created for a tight city backyard used red, white and pink clusters and 12 yellow rose bushes with a backdrop of deciduous and evergreen shurbs.
        He won the New York chapter's American Society of Landscape Architects award for outstanding design three times. In 1953, he was given a lifetime award by the Horticulture Society of New York. And in 1964, he received the prestigious Buckley Award of the Garden Club of America.
        Mr. Roehrs was the third generation in a family of horticulturists. In 1896, his grandfather, Julius, founded a nursery in Rutherford, N.J., which became known for its exotic plants. The grandson worked there for a time and in 1946 established his own nursery in Franklin Lakes.
        He battled Bergen County and the Franklin Lakes Town Council in the 1970's when a road expansion threatened his own garden. He replanted the shrubs and trees, including a 75-foot Austrian pine, himself and sent an $11,750 bill to the officials. It was a bill he never fully collected.
        He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth; a son, Don Pope Roehrs of Scottsdale, Ariz.; a daughter, Pamela Roehrs Fry of Pisgah Forest, N.C.; a stepson, Peter Morosov of Winter Springs, Fla., and a grandchild.
