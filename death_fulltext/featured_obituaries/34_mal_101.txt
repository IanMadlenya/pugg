        Rogaciano Mercado, a veteran legislator who served under five presidents of the Philippines, died Monday of a heart attack. He was 73 years old.
        He was elected to Congress from Bulacan province in 1953 and served for nearly 20 years until the late President Ferdinand E. Marcos dissolved the legislature after declaring martial law in 1972.
        For a time in 1979, he was placed under house arrest for his public criticism of the Marcos regime.
        In 1984, Mr. Mercado was re-elected to the newly constituted National Assembly and served until 1986. He also served as Minister of Public Works under President Corazon C. Aquino, but was dismissed in November 1986 amid accusations of corruption.
        In May 1987, he was elected to the House of Representatives.
