        Ray Schaffer, who owned A La Vieille Russie, one of the world's leading sellers of Russian art, jewelry and antiques, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 82.
        She had been ill for a long time, her family said.
        Mrs. Schaffer and her husband, Alexander, founded the New York City branch of A La Vieille Russie in 1941. She was its vice president, and he was president until his death in 1972, when she took over. The store is at 781 Fifth Avenue at the corner of 59th Street.
        While Mr. Schaffer made frequent buying trips abroad, Mrs. Schaffer helped to create and shape many prominent collections, including the Faberge eggs displayed at Forbes magazine, the Marjorie MerriweatherPost collection at Hillwood in Washington, the India Early collection now at the Cleveland Museum, the Linsky collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Lillian Thomas Pratt collection now at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts.
        Mrs. Schaffer, whose maiden name was Kohn, was born in Manhattan. After graduating from college and earning a master's degree in education at Hunter College, she taught foreign languages at public schools in Manhattan and Queens.
        Mr. Schaffer's ancestors founded the business in Kiev in 1851. The business moved to Paris after the Russian revolution and later resettled in New York.
        Surviving are two sons, Peter and Paul, both of Manhattan, who together with a grandson, Mark, run the business. She is also survived by a granddaughter, Catherine Schaffer.
