        Msgr. John J. Kowsky, the Roman Catholic chaplain for the New York City Police Department, died, apparently of a heart attack, Wednesday at his brother's home in Queens. He was 66 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Monsignor Kowsky, who attended St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers, was ordained in 1948 and was assigned to St. Joseph's Parish in Spring Valley, N.Y. He taught at Bishop Dubois High School before joining the Army in 1956. He served for 24 years in Germany, Korea and Vietnam and retired as a colonel.
        Monsignor Kowsky's awards and decrorations included the Legion of Merit and, in 1978, he became the first chaplain to receive the Humanitarian Award from the Korean Government.
        Monsignor Kowsky supported the death penalty, speaking out at a 1986 luncheon at the Concord Hotel in the Catskills for delegates at the Police Benevolent Association convention. The group was endorsing Governor Cuomo, an opponent of the death penalty, for re-election, and during the invocation Monsignor Kowsky said: ''And for our Governor, just one little thing he's got to do, Lord. Learn to turn the switch.'' John Cardinal O'Connor will officiate tomorrow at a 9:30 A.M. service in St. Peter's Rectory at 16 Barclay Street.
        Surviving is Monsignor Kowsky's brother, Frederick, retired commander of the police special operations division.
