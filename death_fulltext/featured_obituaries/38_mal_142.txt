        Sol Zausner, former chairman and president of the Zausner Foods Corporation, who introduced commercially produced creme fraiche to cooks in the United States, died of kidney failure yesterday at his home in Martinsville, N.J. He was 71 years old.
        In 1974, Mr. Zausner developed an American version of creme fraiche, the faintly sour, very thick heavy cream that is an essential ingredient in classical French cooking, and sold it under the brand name Sante.
        A native of New York, Mr. Zausner became head of Zausner Foods, a manufacturer of dairy products, in 1955 and retired when it was acquired in 1979 by Group Bongraine, a European food company. Mr. Zausner once said that he was prodded into developing Sante by family members who took annual gastronomic tours of France.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Beatrice Summer; two sons, Eric, of San Francisco, and Andrew, of Washington; a daughter, Holly, of Manhattan, and one grandson.
