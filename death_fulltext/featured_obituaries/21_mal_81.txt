        Mr. Allan, a native of Scotland, came to the United States in 1927. For nearly 50 years he wrote for The Daily Worker and affiliates in Detroit and San Francisco. He was convicted in 1953 of conspiracy to overthrow the United States Government. The conviction was later overturned.
        He is survived by his wife, Stephanie Allan of Oakland, and three daughters.
