        Dr. Anthony Barker, a surgeon, and Dr. Maggie Barker, also a physician, a British husband-and-wife team of medical missionaries, were killed on Aug. 30 when their tandem bicycle was struck by a truck as they were riding in the English Lake District in northern England. He was 72; she was 77.
        The couple spent much of their professional careers in South Africa. They had been celebrating their golden wedding anniversary in the area where they had spent their honeymoon.
        After receiving their medical degrees and graduate training in England, the Barkers went to South Africa in 1945. They took over a dilapidated store at the mission station at Nqutu in Zululand and, with the support of the Missionary Society and other philanthropies, transformed it over the next 27 years into a modern hospital.
        The hospital, which was also their home, became a stopover for hundreds of South Africans and foreigners, some of whom remained to work there.
        The Barkers returned to Britain when the South African Government took control of their hospital over their objections. They then continued their careers at St. George's Hospital in London and worked as fund-raisers for charities in England and South Africa.
        Dr. Anthony Barker's account of their first 15 years in South Africa, "The Man Next to Me," became a best-selling book when it was published in London in 1959.
