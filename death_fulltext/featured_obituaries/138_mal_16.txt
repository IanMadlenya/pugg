        Steven A. Galef, a Manhattan lawyer who was active in health and community affairs in Westchester County, died on Monday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 58 and lived in Ossining, N.Y.
        The cause was throat cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Galef, who was a senior partner in the firm of Wormser, Kiely, Galef & Jacobs, was instrumental in turning the county-operated Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla, N.Y., over to a public benefit corporation last year. He also was a central figure in developing the medical center's new Children's Hospital.
        He held office in a number of public service organizations, including the county chapters of the Red Cross and United Way, the Westchester Health Fund and Jewish Community Services. He was a Democratic county legislator from 1976 to 1980.
        A native New Yorker, he graduated from Washington and Lee University in 1962 and received his law degree from the University of Virginia in 1965.
        He is survived by his wife, State Assemblywoman Sandra R. Galef; their son, Graig, of Atlanta; a daughter, Gwen Galef of White Plains; two brothers, Andrew, of Los Angeles, and Victor, of Radnor, Pa., and a sister, Nancy Shumate of Mendham, N.J.
