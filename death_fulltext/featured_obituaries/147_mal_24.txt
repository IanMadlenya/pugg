        Sol Hoffman, a longtime labor leader in the Northeast, died on March 27 at a friend's home in Jersey City after suffering a heart attack. He was 67.
        Mr. Hoffman, who lived in Teaneck, N.J., was a vice president of Unite, the Union of Needle Trades, Industrial and Textile Employees, and a director of Unite's Pennsylvania, Ohio and South Jersey joint board.
        He was born in Brooklyn on Jan. 8, 1932. After receiving a bachelor's degree in economics from Brooklyn College and a master's in economics from the University of Michigan, he began his union career in 1954 at the International Ladies Garment Workers Union Training Institute. He spent the rest of his career with the I.L.G.W.U., which later became part of Unite.
        He held various positions with the union, organizing and representing workers in Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia. He was elected a vice president of the I.L.G.W.U. in 1974.
        He was a participant in the civil rights movement in the 1950's and the protests against the Vietnam War in the 1960's.
        ''He was very much against the war,'' said Mr. Hoffman's wife, Catherine Lewis. ''He was one of the leading organizers in Harrisburg.''
        Mr. Hoffman was also chairman of the trade union council of the Jewish Labor Committee, a trustee of William Paterson College in Wayne, N.J., and chairman of the college's board of trustees in the early 1980's. He received an honorary doctorate of human letters from the university in 1995.
        Dennis L. Santillo, director of external relations at what is now William Paterson University, said Mr. Hoffman served 15 years on the board, ''longer than any trustee in the history of the university.''
        Besides his wife, Mr. Hoffman is survived by two daughters, Florice, of Pasadena, Calif., and Simone, of Roswell, Ga., and two stepdaughters.
