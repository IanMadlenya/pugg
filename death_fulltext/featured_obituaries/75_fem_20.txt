        Dr. Lillian Batlin Garvey, a family physician who practiced on the Upper East Side for 47 years, died on Friday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 77 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was bone marrow disease, her family said.
        The physician, known professionally as Dr. Batlin, continued to see patients until illness overcame her in February. She also taught for many years as a clinical assistant professor of medicine at New York Medical College and worked on the staff of Metropolitan Hospital Center and Beth Israel Hospital North.
        A native of the city, she graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Barnard College in 1934 at the age of 18 and earned a master's degree in philosophy at Columbia University a year later. She received her medical degree in 1939 from New York University College of Medicine and was an intern at Bellevue Hospital. She went into private practice in 1946.
        Dr. Batlin was a charter member of the American Board of Family Practice, a fellow of the American Academy of Family Physicians and a fellow of the American College of Cardiology. She also served as a vice president of the board of governors of the New York University College of Medicine Alumni Association.
        Dr. Batlin's husband, Dr. Thomas Quincy Garvey Jr., a neurosurgeon, died in 1972. She is survived by a daughter, Dr. Glenda Garvey of Manhattan; a son, Dr. Thomas Q. Garvey 3d of Potomac, Md., and a grandson.
