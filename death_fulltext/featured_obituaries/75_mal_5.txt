        Joseph John Jova, a retired foundation executive and former Ambassador to Mexico and representative at the Organization of American States, died on Wednesday at Washington Hospital Center. He was 75.
        The cause was complications after surgery for a thoracic aneurysm, according to the death certificate.
        Mr. Jova retired as envoy to Mexico City in 1977 and lived in Washington, D.C. For a dozen years after retirement he served as president of Meridian House International in Washington, now Meridian International Center, a not-for-profit institution that organizes conferences and arranges hospitality for foreigners in the United States.
        A native of Newburgh, N.Y., Mr. Jova was a 1938 graduate of Dartmouth College. Until World War II, he worked for the United Fruit Company in Guatemala. He spent the war in the United States Navy, serving as a lieutenant in Europe. In 1947 he joined the State Department and was sent as Vice Consul to Basra, Iraq, where he met and married his British-born wife, the former Pamela Johnson, in 1949.
        He was named Ambassador to Honduras in 1965, representative to the Organization of American States in 1969 and Ambassador to Mexico in 1973.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Jova is survived by two sons, Henry C., of Washington, and J. Thomas, of Seattle; a daughter, Margaret Jova y Grunberg, of Madrid; a sister, Ynes Cline, of Saugerties, N.Y.; a brother, Henri V., of Atlanta, and four granddaughters.
