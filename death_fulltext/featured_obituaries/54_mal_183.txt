        David French Feingold, director of the Bushwick office of the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development, died of a heart attack last Wednesday while playing racquetball, a family spokesman said. Mr. Feingold was 47 years old and a lifelong resident of Brooklyn.
        In 1986 he received the Public Service Award of the Fund for the City of New York for service as architect of the Bushwick Neighborhood Preservation Plan. He joined the housing office in 1976 and was appointed director in 1987. While he was with the office, 3,000 apartments were built or rehabilitated.
        He was a board member of the Bushwick Geographic Targeting Task Force, administered by the New York Community Trust to aid the Bushwick section. He was also an organizing member of the Jefferson Street Task Force, an antidrug neighborhood group.
        Mr. Feingold was a graduate of the University of Chicago and received a Master of Arts degree from the Columbia University School of Social Work.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Susan Minkoff, and a sister, Mimi Real of San Francisco.
