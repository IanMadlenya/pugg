        Irwin C. Lieb, a philosopher and educator who helped bring seven Soviet Jewish scientists to the United States, died on May 23 at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, Calif. He was 66 years old and lived in Pasadena.
        He died of lung cancer, a family spokesman said.
        From 1982 to 1986 Dr. Lieb was the dean and vice president of the University of Southern California's largest division, the College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. He resumed teaching there after he left the post.
        In 1983 he and another professor went to Russia and won passage to the West for seven scientists whose research had been cut off by the Soviet Government when they first applied for immigration.
        His survivors include two sons, Michael and Gordon, and a sister, Rita.
