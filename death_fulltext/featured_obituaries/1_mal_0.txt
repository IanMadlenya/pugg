Dr. Cox, who became a Stanford professor in 1967 and was appointed dean in 1979, was known for his work in paleomagnatism and plate tectonics.
        Allan V. Cox, dean of earth sciences at Stanford University, died Tuesday of injuries suffered in a bicycle accident near his home in Woodside, Calif. He was 60 years old.  Dr. Cox, who became a Stanford professor in 1967 and was appointed dean in 1979, was known for his work in paleomagnatism and plate tectonics.
        He and two other scientists, Dr. S. Keith Runcorn and Dr. Richard R. Doell, won the Vetlesen Prize in 1971 for their study of remnant magnetism in rocks. The study helped resolve a variety of problems relating to the earth and past movements of its continents.
        In 1983, he and seveal colleagues published a new geologic time scale that is used by geologists to correlate their findings. They also conducted studies of rocks showing that the earth's magnetic field has reversed a number of times. These studies confirmed plate tectonic theories of sea floor spreading and continental drift.
        Dr. Cox, who received the Arthur Day Prize of the National Academy of Sciences in 1984, was a former president of the American Geophysical Union.
        He is survived by a sister, Lois Weaver of Redwood City, Calif.
