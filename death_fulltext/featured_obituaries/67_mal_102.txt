        Dr. James A. Batts Jr., professor emeritus at the Medical College of Pennsylvania and a former director of obstetrics and gynecology at Harlem Hospital, died Saturday at the college's medical center in Philadelphia. He was 78 years old and lived in Philadelphia.
        The cause of death was cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Batts, a native of Rocky Point, N.C., graduated from Howard University Medical School and was a decorated combat surgeon in Europe in World War II, attaining the rank of major.
        He was head of community obstetrics and gynecology at Temple University Hospital from 1971 to 1974 and director of obstetrics and gynecology at the Harlem Hospital Center from 1974 to 1979, when he also held a professorship at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons.
        Dr. Batts joined the staff at the Medical College of Pennsylvania in 1979. He retired as senior attending physician and professor emeritus in the department of obstetrics and gynecology three years ago.
        He is survived by his wife, Ruth; three daughters, Diane Batts Morrow of Georgia and Deborah A. Batts and Denise Batts, both of Manhattan; a stepdaughter, Mercedes Ellington, also of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.
