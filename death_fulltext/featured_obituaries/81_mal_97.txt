        Salvador P. Lopez, a former Foreign Minister of the Philippines and president of the University of the Philippines who played a key role in helping to reduce tension in Southeast Asia, died on Tuesday in Manila. He was 82.
        His family said the cause was a heart attack.
        Mr. Lopez served as a delegate to the United Nations in its formative years. As Foreign Minister in the early 1960's, he took part in many negotiations, particularly between Indonesia and Malaysia.
        In 1964, he was dismissed as Foreign Minister because of his opposition to the import of sardines from South Africa because of its apartheid policies.
        He returned to the United Nations where he continued to champion civil rights and freedom of information. He also became a special envoy to help keep peace in Southeast Asia. And he served as Ambassador to France from 1955 to 1962 and to the United States for a brief period in 1968.
        In 1969, he was appointed president of the University of the Philippines. For six years, he struggled to uphold academic freedom in periods of student demonstrations against the authoritarian rule of President Ferdinand Marcos.
        At one point, he said he would lead any future student demonstrations as a way of showing support for their dissent.
        Mr. Lopez was born in Currimao, Ilocos Norte, and attended the University of the Philippines. He was a journalist in the 1930's and rose to become editor of Manilia's leading newspaper, The Philippines Herald.
        In World War II, he was a captain assigned to General Douglas MacArthur's headquarters on Corregidor Island and was captured by the Japanese when the island fell in May 1942.
        Mr. Lopez is survived by his wife, Adelaida, and two daughters.
