        Steve Cady, a former New York Times sports reporter who mainly covered horse racing and boating, died yesterday at his home in Brewster, Mass., on Cape Cod. He was 68.
        He died after a long illness, said his wife, Carmel.
        Mr. Cady was born in Boston, grew up in Milton, Mass., rose to be a staff sergeant in the Army Air Forces in World War II and graduated in 1949 from Harvard College. He then worked for The Providence Journal in Rhode Island, where he became the yachting columnist.
        He joined The Times in 1960 and was a sports reporter until 1980, when he left to free-lance.
        He was co-author, with Robert Lipsyte, of a novel, "Something Going" (1973), and co-author, with the photographer Barton Silverman, of "Seattle Slew" (1977), a book about that year's Horse of the Year.
        Recently, he and his wife were writing a book about Route 6A on Cape Cod.
        In addition to his wife of 41 years, the former Carmel Zonfrillo, he is survived by a daughter, Stephanie Cady Russe of Eastham, Mass.; a brother, John Lodge Cady of Bronxville, N.Y.; a sister, Joan Mandarino of Toronto, and three grandchildren.
