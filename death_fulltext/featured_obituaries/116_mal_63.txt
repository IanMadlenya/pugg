        John W. Tuthill, who served as United States Ambassador to the European Economic Community and to Brazil, died on Sept. 9 in a Washington hospital. He was 85 and lived in Washington.
        The cause was cancer, said Frances Miller, who helped him write his memoirs.
        Mr. Tuthill, a highly regarded career diplomat, was Ambassador to the European Economic Community from 1962 to 1966. In 1964 he issued a warning in a speech to American businessmen visiting Brussels.
        Europeans, Mr. Tuthill told them, feared that American business was so powerful that it would eventually change Europe's way of life.
        That fear, he said, ''is a factor which you and the United States Government must bear in mind.'' He added, ''We must be especially regardful of local problems, local traditions and local pride.''
        Born in Montclair, N.J., he graduated from the College of William and Mary and received graduate degrees from Harvard and New York University. His diplomatic career extended from 1940 to 1969.
        His memoir, ''Some Things to Some Men: Serving in the Foreign Service,'' is to be published by Minerva Press.
        He is survived by his wife, Erna; a son, David, of Redondo Beach, Calif.; and seven grandchildren.
