        Dr. Darby Wood Betts, an Episcopal priest who was an expert on church architecture and a co-founder of the Episcopal Homes Foundation in the Diocese of California, died on Aug. 14 at Spring Lake Village, an Episcopal Homes residence in Santa Rosa, Calif. He was 86 and also kept a home in Castine, Me.
        At his death, he was Archdeacon for the Elders of the California Diocese.
        In the early 1950's, Dr. Betts served as canon headmaster and precentor at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in New York and studied architecture at Columbia University. He also was an acting chaplain at Columbia who championed decent housing and programs to reduce crime citywide.
        Born in St. Louis, he graduated from Washington and Lee University in 1934, earned his divinity degrees at Virginia Theological Seminary in Alexandria and later added a doctor of divinity degree from the Church Divinity School of the Pacific in Berkeley, Calif.
        In 1960 he moved to California for the rest of his ministry. He became the fifth archdeacon of the state's diocese and rector of St. Paul's Church in Oakland. He retired as rector emeritus in 1973 to take over as full-time chairman of a foundation he helped establish to provide assisted-living spaces for the elderly.
        Dr. Betts is survived by his wife of 47 years, Elaine Wiswall Betts; two daughters, Victoria Stearns of Castine, and Catherine Betts of Stevenson, Wash.; a son, Darby W. Jr., also of Castine; a brother, Frederick B., of Houston; and a grandson.
