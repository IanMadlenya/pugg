        Edward Ross Aranow, a legal expert on corporate takeovers, died on Sunday in his home in Scarsdale, N.Y. He was 84 years old.
        His family said the cause was cancer.
        Mr. Aranow wrote two books that have become standard texts in law firms and law schools: "Proxy Contests for Corporate Control" (1957) and "Developments in Tender Offers for Corporate Control" (1978). He was working on a revision of the first book at the time of his death.
        Mr. Aranow worked his way through Columbia College and Columbia Law School, receiving his law degree in 1932. He was elected president of the law school's Alumni Association in 1965 and later was awarded the Columbia Alumni Medal for Distinguished Service and the Columbia Law School Medal for Excellence.
        He is survived by his wife, Rita; two daughters, Vicki Feiner of Chappaqua, N.Y., and Judith of Loveland, Colo., and a son, Robert, also of Loveland.
