        Mumtaz Nassar, member of the New Wafd Party and former leader of the opposition bloc in Parliament, died of kidney failure today, his party announced. He was 72 years old.
        Although Mr. Nassar was in the hospital at the time, he ran in April 6 parliamentary elections and won a seat in his constituency in Assiut, southern Egypt.
        But as the election laws in Egypt stipulate that more than 50 percent of seats in any constituency must go to a laborer rather than a professional, he was forced to give it up.
        Mr. Nassar had been a Member of Parliament for 20 years. His Wafd Party, with 57 seats, led the opposition bloc in the 458-seat Parliament before it was dissolved by President Hosni Mubarak in February.
        He was popular in his constituency because of his habit of accepting cases without charging a fee for those who could not afford it.
        He is survived by his wife.
