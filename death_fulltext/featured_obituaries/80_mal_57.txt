        Frederick Ungeheuer, a senior correspondent covering the financial industry for Time magazine, died yesterday after a fall from his 12th-floor apartment on East 70th Street in Manhattan. He was 61.
        Police Officer Scott Bloch said an investigation into the death had not been completed.
        Mr. Ungeheuer was a correspondent in Europe and Africa, first for Reuters and then for Time from 1958 to 1969, when he became a contributing editor in Europe for Harpers magazine. He rejoined Time as its United Nations bureau chief from 1971 to 1973 and again in 1977 as a European economic correspondent, then as Paris bureau chief. He returned to New York this year.
        Mr. Ungeheuer was born in Frankfurt, Germany, and graduated from Harvard in 1957, magna cum laude.
        He is survived by his wife, Barbara.
