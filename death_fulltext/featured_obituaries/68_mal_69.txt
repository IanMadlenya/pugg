        Buddy Barnes, a singer and pianist who was the singer Mabel Mercer's accompanist and musical director for seven years, died on Friday at St. Vincent's Hospital. He was 52 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of AIDS, his family said.
        Mr. Barnes, who was a popular cabaret performer, called Miss Mercer the biggest influence on his singing and Cy Walter the one great influence on his piano style.
        Mr. Barnes is survived by a sister, Lorie Barnes of Manhattan; a brother, Dr. Geoffrey Barnes of Baltimore, and a half-brother, Robert A. Hart of Davis, Calif.
