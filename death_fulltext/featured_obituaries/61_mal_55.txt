        Walter J. Sheerin, a longtime state and local labor leader in New York and an advocate for laws improving pensions and other benefits, died on Jan. 30 at Winthrop University Hospital in Mineola, L.I. He was 83 years old and was a resident of New Hyde Park, L.I.
        He died of heart failure and complications of Parkinson's disease, his family said.
        A 23-year veteran of the New York City Fire Department, Mr. Sheerin started his union activity as an officer of the Uniformed Firefighters Association. He served as its borough trustee for Brooklyn for 16 years and was elected union president, serving from 1957 to 1959. During his tenure, he tangled with Mayor Robert F. Wagner and fire officials on a variety of issues, including pay, work schedules, staffing levels, morale and absenteeism.
        He also became a vice president of both the city's Central Labor Council and its parent body, the state A.F.L.-C.I.O.
        After leaving the Fire Department in 1960, Mr. Sheerin continued his union career by working for the coalition of hotel trade unions. He also became the executive director of the New York Labor-Management Council of Health and Welfare Plans, whose member unions and employers represented 700,000 workers.
        He campaigned for better health coverage, pensions and other benefits. He was especially active in helping win passage of the heart bill, a controversial state law qualifying police and fire officers with heart ailments for higher disability pensions on the presumption that their illnesses are work-related. He also helped win cost-of-living adjustments in pensions and pressed for the adoption of Medicare, the Federal health care program for the elderly.
        Mr. Sheerin was born in Elizabeth, N.J. He was a fourth-degree member of the Knights of Columbus.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Sarah Curran; a daughter, Dorothy Gill of Holmdel, N.J.; a son, Walter T. of Woodhaven, Queens, and four grandchildren.
