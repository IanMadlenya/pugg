        He was the author of the autobiographical "Good Faith and Credit" (Cornwall Books, 1984).
        Mr. Hammer is survived by his wife of 53 years, the former Sarah Saltzman; two sons, Robert and Benjamin, both of Brooklyn; a daughter, Leah Rubenstein of Falls Church, Va.; a sister, Esther Ecker, and five grandchildren.
