        James J. McGuire, a retired deputy chief inspector of the New York City Police Department and the former head of its Emergency Service Division, died of complications of kidney disease yesterday at his home in the Bronx. He was 82 years old.
        Mr. McGuire, a police officer for 39 years, was the father of former Police Commissioner Robert J. McGuire.
        Born in Manhattan, he spent his entire career in the emergency service unit and was decorated for bravery several times.
        One of his most dangerous assignments came several days before his retirement in 1967, when he and other rescue workers dug through the debris of a partially collapsed building at 53d Street and Broadway, trying to save the lives of three trapped men, while the remaining wall hung precariously over them.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary; three sons, Robert and Raymond, both of Manhattan, and James Jr., of Hightstown, N.J.; a daughter, Anne Ferrara of Islip, L.I., and nine grandchildren.
