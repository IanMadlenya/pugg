        Vincent James Aufiero, the retired owner of Monsignore, an Italian restaurant on the East Side of Manhattan, died on Friday at New York Hospital. He was 75 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of liver cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Aufiero, who was known as Jimmy, was born in New Haven and moved to Italy at the age of 6 with his family. He graduated from the University of Naples, returning to the United States shortly before World War II.
        He opened Monsignore in 1956, and it quickly gained a celebrity following. He operated the restaurant at various East Side locations, retiring in 1984.
        Mr. Aufiero is survived by his wife, the former Elizabeth Tarin; a daughter, Jessica, of Manhattan; two sisters, Matilde DeFelice and Rachele, both of Naples, and a brother, Frank, of Manhattan.
