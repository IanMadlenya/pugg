        Simon Weber, a writer and editor at The Jewish Daily Forward for nearly 50 years, died Tuesday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. He was 77 years old and lived in Brooklyn.
        He edited the short stories of Isaac Bashevis Singer, and was sent to Stockholm with the writer when he won the Nobel Prize in 1978.
        Born in Stachev, Poland, Mr. Weber immigrated to the United States in 1929, settling in Detroit. There, he studied Yiddish literature and English, and taught in a Yiddish school.
        In 1932, he began writing for The Morning Freiheit, then a New York Yiddish daily paper. Later he worked for The Yiddish World, in Philadelpia, and joined The Forward in 1939.
        In 1966, Mr. Weber was appointed to the New York City Youth Board in the administration of Mayor John V. Lindsay.
        When The Forward celebrated its 90th birthday last May, Mr. Weber announced his retirement. During his years, the paper declined in readership as its readers assimilated into the community. Once a daily paper, it is now published weekly.
        Mr. Weber also said that it was becoming more difficult to find writers in Yiddish.
        He is survived by his wife, Sylvia; and his daughter, Lillian Silver of Rochester.
