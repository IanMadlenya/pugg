        R. Patrick Thompson, the president of the New York Mercantile Exchange since 1989, died Wednesday in Bethesda, Md. He was 51 and lived in New Rochelle, N.Y.
        The cause was a heart attack, the exchange reported.
        Mr. Thompson spent 20 years at the exchange as a trader or executive. He became president in 1989 after serving as a vice president, senior vice president and general counsel.
        During his tenure as president, the exchange firmed its position as a world leader in energy futures and options trading. It took over the Commodity Exchange, a New York-based metals futures market, and started electronic after-hours trading at a new headquarters in Lower Manhattan.
        Mr. Thompson was born in Washington and graduated from St. Joseph's College in Philadelphia in 1971 and from the Catholic University law school in 1975. Before he became a trader on the Mercantile Exchange floor he worked for the enforcement division of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as a supervisory lawyer in New York and as a trial lawyer in San Francisco.
        Mr. Thompson is survived by his wife, Debra; a son, David, of Hoboken, N.J.; three daughters, Aimie Zinzi and Sarah, both of suburban Baltimore, and Jacqueline, of New Rochelle; his mother, Mary, and a brother, Michael, both of Bethesda.
