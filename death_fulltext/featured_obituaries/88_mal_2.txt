        Joseph C. Fitzpatrick, an art teacher whose students included Andy Warhol and Philip Pearlstein, died on Friday at the Elk Haven Nursing Home in St. Marys, Pa. He was 85 and lived in Pittsburgh.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, said a friend, Marlene Harris.
        Mr. Fitzpatrick either taught art or supervised art instruction in the Pittsburgh schools for 33 years. For many years, until his retirement in 1974, he also taught gifted students at the Carnegie Institute there.
        In addition to Mr. Warhol and Mr. Pearlstein, his students in this special program included nationally known artists like Mel Bochner and Raymond Saunders.
        Mr. Fitzpatrick graduated from Edinboro State College in Pennsylvania and received a master's degree from Columbia University.
        He is survived by two sisters, Helen Price of Pottsville, Pa., and Teresa Meiswinkel of Greensburg, Pa.
