        Lieut. Col. Jose Maria Lemus Lopez, who was president of El Salvador from 1956 until he was ousted by a military coup in 1960, died here Wednesday of Hodgkin's disease. He was 81.
        Colonel Lemus, who used his Salvadoran title of military rank until his death, had lived here in exile with his family since the coup. He lived a mostly quiet life until last Sept. 23, when his two pit bull terriers fatally attacked an elderly man, Neftali Villegas, and wounded two others.
        Last week, on March 22, a local judge found Colonel Lemus guilty of negligence in Mr. Villegas's death and fined him the equivalent of about $1,000. The four-day hearing was held mostly at the Lemus home because he was too ill to leave, said one of his sons, Orlando Lemus.
        Besides his wife, Coralia Barraga, Mr. Lemus is survived by four daughters, Elena, Maria Cristina, Ana Margarita and Carmen, and four sons, Jose Maria, Julio, Orlando and Rodrigo.
