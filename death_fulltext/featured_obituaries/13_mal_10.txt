        Albert Abrams, a retired shoe polish manufacturer long active in charitable causes, died of leukemia Friday at Delray Beach, (Fla.) Community Hospital. He was 76 years old and lived in Boca Raton, Fla.
        He formerly lived in Brookville, L.I., and was a Brooklyn native.
        Mr. Abrams and his brother, Sam, started out as chemists. During the Depression they took over an ailing boot-polish maker, the Knomark Manufacturing Company of Brooklyn.
        With Sam as president and Al as treasurer, the company in 1938 bought the Esquire brand. They took a gamble on a saturation advertising campaign in 1944 and nursed Esquire into the nation's best-selling shoe-polish.
        The family sold Knomark in the late 1950's. Albert Abrams remained active in real estate in New York and Florida and continued his charitable work. He was one of the fund-raisers and contributors who made possible the establishment of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology.
        Mr. Abrams is survived by his wife, the former Lydia Bronstein; two sons, Isaac, of Woodstock, N.Y., and Robert, of Oakdale, L.I., and eight grandchildren.
