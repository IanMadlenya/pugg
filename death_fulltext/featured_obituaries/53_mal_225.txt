        David Mankaba, a guitarist whose pop group the Bhundu Boys helped popularize African music in Europe and the United States, died on Thursday of tuberculosis complicated by AIDS, relatives said today. He was 32 years old and lived in Harare, the Zimbabwean capital.
        It was the first time AIDS has been listed as the official reason for the death of a prominent figure in Zimbabwe. Friends said on Friday that Mr. Mankaba had asked that his illness be publicized to help in an AIDS awareness campaign.
        The Bhundu Boys made several successful tours of Europe and the United States and were especially popular in Britain.
        After collapsing on tour in the United States last year, Mr. Mankaba was diagnosed as being infected with the virus that causes AIDS, friends and relatives said.
        Mr. Mankaba was divorced. Survivors include his 9-year-old son, Louis.
        Funeral arrangements are pending.
