        Leon S. Roudiez, a professor emeritus and former head of the French department at Columbia University, died Friday at his home in Stevensville, Md. He was 86 and formerly lived in Closter, N.J.
        His death was announced by his family.
        Dr. Roudiez taught French literature in the graduate faculty of Columbia from 1959 until his retirement in 1987. He was appointed a professor in 1962 and was head of the department from 1971 to 1974.
        The son of an Army officer, Leon Samuel Roudiez Jr. was born in Bronxville, N.Y., and raised in Germany and France. He was educated at the University of Paris, receiving a baccalaureate in 1936 and a law degree in 1938.
        He completed his education at Columbia with an M.A. in 1940 and a Ph.D. in 1950. In between, he was commissioned into the Army Signal Corps, trained in military intelligence and, posted to England, took part in the landing on Omaha Beach and the campaign to liberate France.
        Dr. Roudiez wrote many articles and essays and several books interpreting contemporary French writers and introducing them to the American public. He was the managing editor of The French Review from 1953 to 1961 and, over the years, contributed hundreds of reviews of books by French authors to publications including The New York Times.
        Most recently he translated books by Julia Kristeva, a pioneering French feminist and semiotician. He also wrote ''French Fiction Revisited'' (Dalkey Archive Press, 1991), which remains in print.
        Dr. Roudiez is survived by a daughter, Genevieve S. Roudiez of Nantucket, Mass.; a son, Francis H. of Stevensville; and five grandchildren. His wife of nearly 59 years, Jacqueline Strich Roudiez, died on April 23.
