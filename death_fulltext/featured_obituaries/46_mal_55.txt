        Louis Lichtman, a baker who ran a bread and pastry shop on the Upper West Side of Manhattan for 40 years, died on Monday at the Jewish Home and Hospital in Manhattan. He was 78 years old and lived in Fort Lee, N.J.
        He died of cardiac arrest, his son Harvey, of Manhattan, said.
        Lichtman's Bakery, with its challah and rye breads, its strudel, Danish and other rich confections, was a neighborhood landmark at 86th Street and Amsterdam Avenue.
        After emigrating from Hungary in 1938, Mr. Lichtman opened his first bakery at 85th Street and Amsterdam in 1947. He moved to 86th Street in 1962 and closed on June 1, 1987, when high rents forced him out.
        In addition to his son Harvey, he is survived by his wife, Eleanor; another son, Ron, of Fair Lawn, N.J.; a brother, Alex, of West Palm Beach, Fla., and three grandchildren.
