        Rex Robbins, who performed on stage, in movies and in more than 300 commercials, died on Sept. 23 in Pierre, S.D., while visiting relatives. He was 68 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was a subdural aneurysm, or a ballooning blood vessel in the brain, said his daughter Mary Victoria Robbins.
        A product of Yale's undergraduate theater program, Mr. Robbins was a versatile actor who appeared in 18 Broadway shows from 1963 to 2000. He was the put-upon but decent agent, Herbie, in the 1974 revival of ''Gypsy'' with Angela Lansbury; the scheming Buckingham in the 1979 ''Richard III'' with Al Pacino; and a pompous member of Parliament in the 1993 ''Sisters Rosensweig.''
        Mr. Robbins often performed at the Williamstown Summer Theater Festival and the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven. He traveled nationally in ''Gypsy'' with Ms. Lansbury, ''Hello, Dolly!'' with Carol Channing and ''Into the Woods'' with Cleo Laine. His movie credits include ''The Royal Tenenbaums,'' ''1776'' and the original ''Shaft.''
        He is survived by his wife, Patricia; their daughters Margaret Robbins and Mary Victoria Robbins, both of Manhattan; their son, Timothy, of Brooklyn; and a brother, Bill, of Maple Plain, Minn.
