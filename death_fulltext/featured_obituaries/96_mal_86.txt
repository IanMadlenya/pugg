        Henry Harrison Coords, former president of Fisher-Price toys, died on Thursday at Jupiter Medical Center in Jupiter, Fla. He was 79 and lived in Jupiter.
        The cause of death was Crohn's disease, said his wife, Gertrude.
        During Mr. Coords's 14-year tenure as president of Fisher-Price, he transformed the company into an industry leader as sales rose to more than $300 million in 1980 from $25 million in 1966.
        Mr. Coords began his career at Western Electric of Newark in 1941 as a price engineer. In his 25 years at Western Electric, he rose to the position of general manager of Northeast region service division before leaving the company for Fisher-Price.
        Mr. Coords, who had no previous experience in the toy industry, was named president of Fisher-Price in 1966, replacing Herman G. Fisher, a co-founder of the company. Quaker Oats acquired the company in 1969.
        Upon his retirement, Mr. Coords was named chairman emeritus of Fisher-Price, which was recently acquired by Mattel Inc., but he gave up this post in 1981 when he was appointed executive vice president of corporate relations for the National Alliance of Business, a nonprofit group that works with business to provide jobs and training for the poor. Mr. Coords retired from the alliance in 1986.
        Besides his wife, Gertrude, he is survived by two daughters, Joan Kipe of Califon, N.J., and Bonnie Alder of Franklinville, N.Y.; two sons, Robert, of Miami and Dwight, of Franklinville; a stepdaughter, Janet Cincotta of Wellsville, Pa.; a stepson, Peter Forman of Irving, Tex.; two stepsisters, Grace and Francis Coords, both of Lancaster, Pa.; two stepbrothers, Richard, of St. Petersburg, Fla., and Don, of Middlesex, N.J., and 19 grandchildren.
