        Dr. Robert J. Schnitzer, a specialist in chemotherapy and one of those who developed a principal drug used against tuberculosis, died yesterday at his home in Nutley, N.J. He was 92 years old.
        Dr. Schnitzer led the way in the 1940's in the development of the drug, Isoniazid, or INH, which was used in the effort to eradicate tuberculosis in the 1950's.
        Dr. Schnitzer, who was born in Germany and earned his medical degree from the University of Berlin in 1919, fled Nazi persecution in 1939 and came to the United States in 1941.
        He settled in Nutley in that year and became the head of chemotherapy research at Hoffman-La Roche, the pharmaceutical company in Nutley. He retired from the company in 1960.
        Dr. Schnitzer became a member of the editorial board of a medical journal, Environmental Research, and joined the environmental research division of Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan, where he also lectured on chemotherapy.
        He is survived by his wife, Peggy; a daughter, Muriel Mota of Roseland, N.J.; a son, Bertram, of Ann Arbor, Mich., and five grandchildren.
