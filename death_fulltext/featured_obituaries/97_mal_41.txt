        Prof. Wallace W. Douglas, an innovator in the teaching of English and an authority on the Romantic poets, died last Tuesday at a nursing home in Park Ridge, Ill. He was 80 and lived in Evanston, Ill.
        The cause was complications from Parkinson's disease, said Arlene Napolilli, a cousin.
        He was professor emeritus of English at Northwestern University in Evanston, where he taught from 1945 until his retirement in 1980. He became a full professor in 1964, and also held a professorship in Northwestern's School of Education and Social Policy.
        Professor Douglas focused on Wordsworth, and wrote many articles about the poet's complex politics and business dealings. He also reviewed Wordsworth's poetry from a psychoanalytical perspective in a book, "Wordsworth: The Construction of a Personality" (Houghton Mifflin, 1959).
        A noted stylist, he was a co-editor of "The Critical Reader," published by Norton in 1949 and revised in 1962, and was editor of "The Character of Prose" (Houghton, 1959). Both volumes presented college students with models of good writing.
        Professor Douglas was a past director of the Curriculum Center in English at Northwestern, where he influenced future teachers of writing and English literature.
        He was born in Chicago and received a bachelor's degree from Colgate University, a master's degree from the University of Chicago and a doctorate from Harvard University. He taught at Indiana University and Williams College before joining the faculty at Northwestern.
        There are no immediate survivors.
