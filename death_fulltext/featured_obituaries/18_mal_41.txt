        Dr. John D. Clark, a chemist who specialized in storable liquid rocket fuels, died Wednesday at St. Clare's Hospital in Denville, N.J., after a long illness. He was 80 years old and lived in Newfoundland, N.J.
        Dr. Clark, a native of Fairbanks, Alaska, was in charge of research and development of rocket propellants at the Naval Air Rocket Test Station and its successor, the Liquid Propulsion Laboratory, at the Army's Picatinny Arsenal in Dover, N.J.
        Under his direction, a revolutionary new family of high-energy liquid propellants was developed by a group of Navy civilian scientists in 1959. Unlike earlier propellants that had to be handled with great care to prevent explosions, the new fuels could be dropped, pounded or heated to more than 300 degrees Fahrenheit without exploding.
        Dr. Clark, who retired in 1970, was the author of ''Ignition,'' published by Rutgers University Press in 1972, a history of the search for a power package to take man into space.
        He is survived by a brother, Warren, of Balboa, Calif.
