        Bishop Henry Ambrose Pinger, a Roman Catholic priest whose three decades of missionary service in the Orient included nine years of imprisonment, died Saturday. He was 91 years old.
        He spent four years in Japanese concentration camps during World War II, and was arrested by the Chinese Communists in 1951 and imprisoned for five years. He and other imprisoned Americans were released after negotiations between Chinese and American officials.
        ''I feel no rancor in my heart toward the Communists of China, its Government, its officials and least of all, the Chinese people,'' Bishop Pinger once said. ''I try to love them because I feel that prayers for a person whom I love will be more effective.''
        After being freed, he spent two years in Chicago before arriving in 1958 in Indianapolis, where he was chaplain for the Little Sisters of the Poor until 1984.
        From 1984 to 1986, he served at St. Paschal's Church in Oak Brook, Ill., a Chicago suburb.
