        Vasiliki Johnides, who founded a Long Island restaurant popular with food critics and celebrities, died on Tuesday at Southampton Hospital in Southampton, L.I.
        Mrs. Johnides, known as Mama Bessie, celebrated her 92d birthday the day before. She lived in Sagaponack and died of a stroke and heart attack, her family said.
        Mrs. Johnides opened the Old Stove Pub in a farmhouse on Montauk Highway in Sagaponack in 1969 and remained active in its operation until her illness.
        Her homestyle Greek taverna recipes won praise from the food critic Craig Claiborne. Later she expanded the menu to include steaks and chops.
        The restaurant's clientele included Barbara Walters, Hugh L. Carey, Sidney Lumet, George Plimpton, Peter Maas, Elia Kazan, Gloria Vanderbilt, Truman Capote, Billy Joel, Calvin Klein, Mario Puzo and Joseph Heller.
        Artists sometimes paid their bills with paintings. In busy periods, some customers helped to serve the food.
        Born on the island of Limnos in Greece, Mrs. Johnides came to the United States at the age of 14. She was married for 57 years to John Johnides, who worked in real estate in Boston. After he died in 1969, she opened the restaurant, joined by her children.
        Surviving are two daughters, Coula and Helen, and two sons, Stephen and Constantine, also known as Gus, all of Sagaponack.
