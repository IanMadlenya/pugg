        Monsignor Heneghan had been a priest for 57 years. He was ordained in Rome in 1932. In 1934 he was assigned to Our Lady of Mount Carmel, and several years later he began studies at the Catholic University of America in Washington, where he earned a doctorate in canon law.
        He was later named vice chancellor of the Brooklyn Diocese and then chancellor in 1959. In 1965 he returned to Our Lady of Mount Carmel, and in 1980 he became pastor emeritus.
        Monsignor Heneghan was born in Brooklyn and was a graduate of Cathedral College there. He also studied at the Immaculate Conception Seminary in Huntington, L.I., and at the North American College and Gregorian University, both in Rome.
        He is survived by a brother, Dr. William F. Heneghan of Cutchogue, L.I., and 17 nieces and nephews.
