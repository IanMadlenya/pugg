        Dr. John C. Condry, a Cornell University educator and expert on the psychology of television and its impact on children, died on Sunday at Tompkins Community Hospital in Ithaca, N.Y. He was 54 and lived nearby in rural Freeville.
        The cause was a heart attack, the university said.
        At the time of his death, Dr. Condry was a professor of human development and family studies at Cornell's College of Human Ecology. He had been a member of the faculty since 1966 and had directed the university's Center for Research on the Effects of Television.
        The center, a venture of Cornell and Ithaca College, contains more than 3,800 hours of video, including 5,800 television programs and 100,000 commercials. Beginning in the early 1970's, Dr. Condry researched the influence that television exerts on children and the educational content of programming for children.  Author and Co-Author
        He taught courses on social development, motivation and the psychology of television. He was the author of "The Psychology of Television" (Erlbaum Associates, 1989) and assisted Prof. Urie Bronfenbrenner of Cornell in the writing of "Two Worlds of Childhood" (Russell Sage, 1970). He also was the author or co-author of many articles and book chapters.
        Dr. Condry, a native of Cincinnati, graduated from West Virginia University and later earned a master's degree in psychology there. He received a Ph.D. in psychology from the University of California at Los Angeles, in 1966, the year he arrived at Cornell.
        He is survived by his wife of 28 years, Sandra McConnell Condry; a son, Ian, of New Haven, Conn., and two daughters, Kirsten, of Minneapolis, and Jennifer of Middletown, Conn.
