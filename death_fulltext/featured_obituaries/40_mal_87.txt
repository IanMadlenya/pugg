        Mr. Underhill had lived in a house off Jericho Turnpike since he was born there, on a family farm established in 1793 that once covered 200 acres. Much of the land has been sold, but Mr. Underhill retained 14 acres.
        He was a graduate of Friends Academy, The Gunnery School and Princeton and was a Navy officer in the Pacific in World War II. He was with the Turner Construction Company for several years after the war.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Margaret Young.
