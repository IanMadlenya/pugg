        Stanley J. Friedman, a founder and senior partner of the Manhattan law firm of Shereff Friedman Hoffman & Goodman, died on Wednesday at his home in Riverdale, the Bronx. He was 64.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Friedman was born in Brooklyn. He graduated from Harvard in 1948, and from Yale Law School. After service with the legal section of the Army Signal Corps in Fort Monmouth, N.J., he joined the firm of Berlack, Israels & Liberman in New York, where he specialized in corporate law and financial services. He became a partner in 1960.
        In 1971, he and 11 other lawyers founded Shereff Friedman. He became prominent in the field of financial services, particularly in the representation of mutual funds and their directors.
        He also lectured at the Practicing Law Institute, where he headed various programs, including an annual series on investment companies and the New York Law Journal Seminars. A director of the Jewish Theological Seminary, he provided legal services for that institution.
        In 1988, the American Jewish Committee gave him its Learned Hand Award, and he later served on the committee's board of governors and national affairs commission.
        Mr. Friedman is survived by his wife, the former Shari Ostow; three daughters, Jessica, of Manhattan, Alexandra, of Brooklyn, and Sophia, of Chicago, and a sister, Elaine Marg of Cleveland.
