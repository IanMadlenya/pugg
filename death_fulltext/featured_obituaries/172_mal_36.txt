        Lester Atwell, a novelist and short-story writer, died on April 30 at his home in Cary, N.C. He was 92.
        Born in Brooklyn, where he lived for more than eight decades, Mr. Atwell graduated from Fordham University in the Bronx and attended the Art Students League in Manhattan. He worked as an artist and teacher before being drafted in June 1943, at 35, into the United States Army. He served with the 87th Infantry Division in Europe during World War II, earning the Bronze Star.
        Mr. Atwell wrote about his wartime experiences in ''Private,'' a fictionalized account of the experiences of his inexperienced infantry company and its medical aid station as they were plunged into the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944.
        Mr. Atwell's second book, ''Love Is Just Around the Corner,'' was adapted by George Abbott and Robert Russell for the 1965 Broadway musical ''Flora, the Red Menace.'' Produced by Harold Prince, ''Flora'' earned a Tony Award for its star, Liza Minnelli, who made her Broadway debut in the musical; it began the collaborative careers of the songwriters John Kander and Fred Ebb.
        Mr. Atwell's third book, ''Life With Its Sorrow, Life With Its Tear,'' published in 1971, tells of a teenage orphan who leaves Detroit to live with zany relatives in Westchester County, N.Y.
        His short stories were published in The Saturday Evening Post, Collier's and other magazines.
        No immediate family members survive.
