        Charles Carpenter Batchelder, a philanthropist and patron of the arts who was formerly a Manhattan literary agent, died Thursday at Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia. He was 72 years old and had homes in Philadelphia and St. Thomas, V.I.
        He died of cancer, said his adopted son, Charles Borton of Philadelphia.
        Mr. Batchelder operated Batchelder & McKee, a literary agency in Manhattan, from 1950 to about 1957.
        A graduate of Dartmouth College and Columbia University, he was a contributor to hospitals, to cancer research and to the arts. He served on the boards of St. Thomas Hospital and of the Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company.
        He was a founding director of the Philadelphia Ballet Company and often held galas for ballerinas like Margot Fonteyn at his Philadelphia town house.
        He is also survived by a sister, Mrs. Irenee du Pont Jr. of Wilmington, Del.
