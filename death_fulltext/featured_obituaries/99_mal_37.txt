        Robert Lubar, a former managing editor of Fortune magazine and foreign correspondent for Time magazine, died last Saturday at the Breckenridge Center in Willoughby, Ohio. He was 74. A longtime resident of Port Washington, N.Y., he moved to Whitingham, Vt., when he retired in 1985.
        He had suffered from Parkinson's disease for a number of years, said a son, Nicholas.
        In a career of nearly 40 years with Time Inc., he began as a writer for Time magazine in Manhattan in 1946 and then moved overseas to a series of posts, including London, New Delhi, Bonn and later, Mexico City.
        He moved to Fortune in 1958 as an associate editor. He was an assistant managing editor from 1964 to 1970 before becoming managing editor. For the next 10 years he oversaw the transition to a smaller magazine format and the move from monthly to biweekly publication. He returned to writing as a member of the board of editors before retiring.
        He was born in Manhattan and went to Columbia University, where he received an undergraduate degree and in 1941 a master's in journalism.
        Besides his son Nicholas, of Chagrin Falls, Ohio, he is survived by his wife of 47 years, Patricia Raney Lubar; three others sons, John, of Ottawa, Stephen, of Naples, Fla., and Andrew, of St. Paul, Minn.; a sister, Rachelle Marshall of Stanford, Calif., and five grandchildren.
