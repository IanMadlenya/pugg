        Father McCorry, who entered the Jesuit Order in 1927, wrote extensively and lectured widely. He was a former associate editor of ''America,'' the Jesuit magazine, and wrote a column called The Word for it for 20 years.
        He wrote 11 books, including a novel, ''Monsignor Connolly of St. Gregory's Parish.'' He also worked as a parish priest in Manhattan and taught at many colleges, including Fordham and Loyola College in Baltimore.
        Until shortly before his death, Father McCorry conducted retreats for laymen and members of religious orders.
        He is survived by a sister, Florence E. McCorry of Cliffside Park, N.J., and several nieces and nephews.
