        Joseph Beruh, a theatrical producer whose shows included ''Godspell,'' ''The Magic Show'' and ''American Buffalo,'' died in his sleep on Monday, apparently of a heart attack. He was 65 years old.
        Mr. Beruh, whose 1959 production of ''Leave It to Jane'' ran for three years, operated the Sheridan Square Playhouse for 15 years.
        Before becoming a producer, Mr. Beruh, who was a graduate of Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, served as a company manager or general manager for more than 70 productions.
        He is survived by two sons, David, of Baltimore, and William, of New York; a brother, Edgar, and a sister, Goldie Ottenheimer, both of Pittsburgh.
