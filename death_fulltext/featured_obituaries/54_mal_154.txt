        Terence U. Beirn, an executive of the American Foundation for AIDS Research, died on Tuesday at Roosevelt Hospital. He was 39 years old and lived in Washington and Manhattan.
        He died of AIDS-related brain cancer, said Paul Corser, his companion and a colleague at the foundation.
        Mr. Beirn, a native New Yorker and a graduate of Phillips Exeter Academy and Yale College, was a news correspondent for television station KGO in San Francisco until 1984, when he tested positive for the HIV virus, which causes AIDS.
        He joined in efforts to combat the AIDS epidemic, organizing fund-raising events, creating a quarterly directory of medical treatment for AIDS and helping to gain passage of legislation providing funds for research and clinical trials of experimental drugs to treat the disease. At his death, he was assistant executive director for programs at the research foundation.
        He is survived by his father, F. Kenneth Beirn of Bridgeport, Conn.; a sister, Sarah Jennings of El Paso, and a brother, Christopher, of Goleta, Calif.
