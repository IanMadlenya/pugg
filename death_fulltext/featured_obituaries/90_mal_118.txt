        James R. Johnstone, a former vice chairman of the Union Carbide Corporation, died on Saturday at his home in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. He was 85.
        Born in Lynn, Mass., Mr. Johnstone received an electrical-engineering degree from the University of Illinois. He retired in 1974 after 37 years with Union Carbide. For much of his career, he was associated with its Carbon Products Division in Minneapolis, Salt Lake City and San Francisco.
        The division's headquarters were moved to New York in 1953, and in 1960, he was appointed its president. He became a vice president of the parent company in 1966, and vice chairman in 1971.
        After President Richard M. Nixon established the National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve, Defense Secretary Melvin R. Laird appointed Mr. Johnstone to its executive committee in 1972. The goal of the special board was to heighten understanding of the importance of reserve forces.
        During World War II, Mr. Johnstone served in the Army Corps of Engineers. He rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel and was awarded the Legion of Merit and France's Croix de Guerre.
        Mr. Johnstone is survived by his wife of 52 years, Virginia Caine Hyde Johnstone; a son, James R. Jr. of Lake Bluff, Ill.; a daughter, Janette, of Saratoga Springs; two sisters, Josephine J. Farley and Elizabeth J. Clark, and a brother, George A., all residents of California, as well as two granddaughters.
