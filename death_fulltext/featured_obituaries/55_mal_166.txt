        Will Shafroth, who helped shape the current Federal judical system, died Aug. 23 at the Stewart Health Center in the Springmoor retirement community in Raleigh, N. C. He was 97 years old and lived at Springmoor.
        He died of complications after a stroke, his son, Stephen, of Chapel Hill, N.C., said.
        Mr. Shafroth was Deputy Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts from 1960 to 1964.
        As chief of the office's division of procedural studies and statistics, Mr. Shafroth toured most of the nation's Federal judicial districts collecting data on case loads, jury costs and calendar control, and his reports resulted in new Federal judgeships and changes in judicial procedures.
        Mr. Shafroth, the son of John F. Shafroth, the Governor of Colorado from 1909 to 1913, was trained as a lawyer in the 1930's. He inspected law schools for the American Bar Association, made recommendations for upgrading them and he established the National Conference of Bar Examiners.
        Early in his career, Mr. Shafroth went to Russia for the American Relief Association, the Hoover food relief program. In Russia, from 1919 to 1921, he was a district supervisor of famine relief responsible for feeding 1.2 million people.
        While there, newspapers in London reported that he had been eaten by starving people. This erroneous report was due to a mistake in translation but was believeable then because at that time the famine's severity reportedly forced butchers to sell human flesh.
        In addition to his son, Mr. Shafroth is survived by his wife, Janet Durrie Shafroth, and three grandchildren.
