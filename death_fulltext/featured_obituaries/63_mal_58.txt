        Dr. Benjamin M. Parker, who had a four-fold career as an engineer, rabbi, corporate lawyer and government official, died on Saturday at his home in Arlington, Va. He was 92 years old.
        He died of cerebral arteriosclerosis, his family said.
        Born in Warsaw, he came to the United States at the age of 2. After graduating from Cooper Union in 1920, he worked a few years as an industrial and efficiency engineer for the American Telephone and Telegraph Company.
        He was ordained a rabbi in 1926 after graduating from the Jewish Institute of Religion in Manhattan. He served at Temple Beth-El in Glens Falls, N.Y.
        Dr. Park next went to Germany, earning a doctorate in Gestalt psychology and ethnology at the University of Berlin in 1930. He returned to serve as rabbi of Ochs Memorial Temple in Chattanooga, Tenn., until 1932.
        Then he went to Harvard, where, in 1935, he earned a law degree. He worked for a trial lawyer and was counsel to a Congressional Select Committee on mortgage fraud, then was a special assistant under four United States Attorneys General. He prosecuted 1941 charges that the American distributors of Pravda and Izvestia were unregistered agents of the Soviet Union.
        From 1941 to 1960 he returned to private law practice, and became general counsel and a director of Rich's stores, based in Atlanta.
        In 1961 he rejoined the Justice Department to argue appellate tax cases. In 1971 he became a partner in the firm of Wasserman and Park, later Blum, Parker and Nash, in Washington.
        He was divorced from the former Rachel Neely, now deceased. Surviving are his wife of 30 years, the former Dorothy Botwen Appel, once United States Parole Commissioner and minority counsel of the Senate Judiciary Committee; a daughter, Eve Hoffman of Norcross, Ga.; two sons, Daniel N. of Minneapolis and Nathan of Manhattan; a brother, Joel R. of Washington, and nine grandchildren.
