        John R. Wilhelm, dean emeritus of the College of Communication at Ohio University and a war correspondent who covered the Allied landing on Omaha Beach in Normandy, died yesterday at the Creighton Center at Collington, a retirement community in Mitchellville, Md.
        He was 78 and the cause of death was pneumonia and asthma, the university said.
        Although in poor health in recent years, Mr. Wilhelm filed his last article for the Reuters news service on May 29, recalling his experiences covering the fighting on Omaha Beach. His wartime marriage to Margaret Maslin, a Red Cross worker in northern France, was featured in Life magazine.
        After graduating from the University of Minnesota School of Journalism, Mr. Wilhelm was a reporter for The Chicago Tribune and a correspondent in Britain, Argentina and Mexico.
        He was appointed dean in 1968 and dean emeritus in 1981.
        He was a president of the Overseas Press Club of America in New York City.
        He is survived by his wife, Margaret; a daughter, Martha W. Kessler of Millis, Mass.; three sons, Richard, of New York City, Lawrence, of Annapolis, Md., and Skip, of Norwalk, Conn.; three sisters, Marjorie W. Hart of Riverton, Wyo., Ruth W. Lindley of Jefferson, Ind., and Marion Wilhelm of Washington; a brother, Charles, of Hunt Valley, Md., and six grandchildren.
