        William Van Orden, a part-time sculptor who devoted the last part of his life to the defense and restoration of a statue of the actress Myrna Loy, died of cancer on March 18 at the Country Villa Westwood nursing home in West Los Angeles. He was 67 years old and lived in Venice, Calif.
        Mr. Van Orden became bedridden from his illness at the end of last year, after restoring the Myrna Loy statue, which stands on the grounds of Venice High School, for the 12th time in the last decade.
        The seven-foot statue was sculptured in the 1920's by a former Venice High School art teacher, Harry Winebrenner, whose model was a high school student, Myrna Williams, later known as Myrna Loy. It has become a target of pranksters, who at various times have adorned it with paint, garments and even tar and feathers.
        After vandals blew off the statue's head and an arm with dynamite in 1978, Mr. Van Orden assumed the commitment to protect it. ''She is the woman of my life,'' he said last year, adding that when he closed his eyes he could see Miss Loy's face ''just the way she was in the movies.''
        Mr. Van Orden admitted that he was not very successful as a sculptor and said he supported himself with housepainting and odd jobs. He said his one regret was that in all the years he had dedicated to Ms. Loy, he had never heard from her. The actress, who is now in her 80's, lives in New York.
        Mr. Van Orden is survived by his mother, Emily; a son, Rodan; a sister, Jane Kowach, and three brothers: Arthur, Frank and Raymond.
