        Schuyler Neilson Pyne, a retired rear admiral and former commander of the New York Naval Shipyard in Brooklyn, died Saturday at Anne Arundel General Hospital, Annapolis, Md., after a long illness. He was 83 years old and lived in Annapolis.
        Admiral Pyne was a builder of fighting ships and was the commanding officer of the Brooklyn Navy Yard from 1958 to 1961. During his tenure, a fire aboard the aircraft carrier Constellation, which was under construction at the shipyard, killed 46 workers and resulted in a tightening of Navy safety regulations.
        Admiral Pyne was born in Elizabeth, N.J. The son of a rear admiral, he attended the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis.
        After graduation in 1925, he served two years of sea duty before the Navy sent him to school to become an architect. In 1930 he received a master's degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
        Until he retired in 1961, Admiral Pyne was largely engaged in the design, construction and repair of fighting ships.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Jane Louise Martin; a son, Richard S., of Pensacola, Fla.; two daughters, Sally Kennedy of Ann Arbor, Mich., and Ellen Freit of Arnold, Md., and eight grandchildren.
