        Edward J. (Doc) Storey, a longtime football coach and teacher at Mamaroneck (N.Y.) High School and a nationally renowned authority on how to kick a football, died Thursday in Greenfield, Mass. He was 87 years old and suffered a stroke last month.
        Mr. Storey applied principles of physics, taken from his engineering education, to kicking footballs, and he got inspiring results. He wrote two books on the subject and helped thousands of young people improve their punting and place-kicking skills.
        Mr. Storey was born in Somerville, Mass., and graduated from the University of New Hampshire, where he was a football player despite his 5-foot-3-inch height. He earned postgraduate degrees at Columbia University and New York University, and began coaching and teaching at Mamaroneck in 1932.
        After retirement he moved to Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, Fla., and continued to teach kicking skills there and at summer clinics, as well as at Auburn University and the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point.
        Mr. Storey, a member of the National Football Foundation and the Hall of Fame, lived in recent years in South Deerfield, Mass. He is survived by his wife, Helen; a son, Edward Jr. of Arlington, Va.; a daughter, Amy Rokoszak of South Deerfield, and four grandchildren.
