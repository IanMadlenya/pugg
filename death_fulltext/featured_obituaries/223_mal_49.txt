        Alan Fredericks, a travel writer and editor who began his career as the host of a popular doo-wop radio show in New York City, died on July 31 at his home in Old Bridge, N.J. He was 70.
        The cause was cancer, said his son Todd.
        Mr. Fredericks was the editor of Travel Weekly, a trade publication, from 1972 until 1997. He was named travel journalist of the year in 1995 by the American Society of Travel Agents, becoming the first member of the trade press to receive the award. He was inducted into the Travel Industry Association's hall of leaders earlier this year.
        Born Alfred Israel, he adopted the name Alan Fredericks in 1954 as a 20-year-old disc jockey. He was host of the ''Night Train'' radio show in New York from the late 1950's through 1964, acting as keeper of the flame for doo-wop groups even as the sound waned with the onset of the British Invasion. The program was heard on radio stations WGBB, WHOM and WADO. He was born in the Bronx and graduated from New York University. He is survived by his wife, Cathy, and their daughter, Caitlin Fredericks of Old Bridge, N.J.; two sons by his first marriage, Lon, of Manhattan, and Todd, of Brooklyn; a brother, Jerry Israel, of Indianapolis; and his first wife, Natalie Fredericks of Manhattan.
