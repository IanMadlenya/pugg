        Barbara Schwei, a founder and the producer of the American Indian Dance Theater, died on Sept. 29 at her home in Manhattan. She was 57.
        The cause was breast cancer, according to Les Schecter, a friend.
        Born in Milwaukee, Ms. Schwei received her degree in theater from New York University. She began her career in the late 1960's as a theatrical press agent. She was a producer of the 1973 Broadway stage musical ''Nash at Nine'' and, with James Nederlander, the ''International Music Stars'' series. She produced concerts in New York and across the United States and Canada by European pop music performers and composers including Enrico Macias, Gilbert BÃ©caud, Charles Trenet and Domenico Modugno.
        Ms. Schwei founded the American Indian Dance Theater in 1987 with Hanay Geiogamah, its artistic director. It was the first all-American Indian professional company of dancers, singers and musicians, with a repertory of traditional pieces that crossed tribal lines and cultures. The company, which has also performed modern work by choreographers including Laura Dean, has appeared twice in the PBS ''Great Performances'' series and was featured on Turner Broadcasting's 1994 documentary series ''The Native Americans.'' It has toured North America, Europe and the Middle and Far East.
        The company also released an original cast album for which Ms. Schwei was nominated as producer for a Grammy Award in 1990.
        Ms. Schwei is survived by a brother, Peter, of Dodgeville, Wisc.
