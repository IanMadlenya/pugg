        Dr. Bober wrote or edited several books and published numerous articles on the art, architecture and historiography of the Middle Ages and the early Renaissance period. His most famous works included the editing of the two-volume ''Catalogue of Astrological and Mythological Illuminated Manuscripts of the Latin Middle Ages: English Libraries,'' (1953). He also wrote ''Medieval Objects in the Guennal Collection'' (1975) and the essay ''Reappraisal of Rayonnant Architecture,'' which explains the legitimacy of that architectural style.
        In 1965 New York University named Dr. Bober the first Avalon Professor of the Humanities; he had been at the university's Institute of Fine Arts since 1954. Dr. Bober also taught at Queens College, Smith College, Harvard University and Johns Hopkins University.
        He is survived by his former wife, Phyllis, of Ardmore, Pa., and his two sons, Jonathan, of Austin, Tex., and David, of Manhattan.
