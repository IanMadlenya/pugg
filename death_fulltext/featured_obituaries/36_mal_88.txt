        Joseph Dermody, a retired labor organizer and former president of Local 12 of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, died of complications of diabetes on Friday at the Waverly Care Center in New Canaan, Conn. He was 84 years old and lived in New Canaan.
        Mr. Dermody, who was also on the executive board of the American Labor Party, worked as a sheetmetal worker at Bell Telephone Laboratories in New York for 17 years before becoming international representative of the United Electrical Workers. During the 1940's, he negotiated contracts with General Electric for about 125,000 electrical workers.
        In 1948, the Atomic Energy Commission ordered G.E. to withdraw recognition of the union as the representative of workers at atomic energy plants because union leaders had refused to sign loyalty oaths. The following year, the union was expelled from the Congress of Industrial Organizations for following Communist policies. Mr. Dermody denied he was a member of the Communist Party. The union continued to operate as an independent, and Mr. Dermody retired as international representative in 1971.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Ruth Austin; a daughter, Denise Dermody of New Canaan, and two grandchildren.
