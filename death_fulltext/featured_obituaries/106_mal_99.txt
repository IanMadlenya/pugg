        Sam Bailey, a civil rights advocate who worked with Medgar Evers in the quest for racial equality in Mississippi, died on Saturday at his home in Jackson. He  was 80.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        A native of Union Church, Miss., Mr. Bailey was a railroad worker who fought for better conditions for black workers in the 1940's.
        In 1961, he was one of three men who filed a Federal suit to desegregate public transportation and accommodations in Mississippi. The plaintiffs appealed to the United States Supreme Court after a three-judge Federal court in Jackson  refused to rule on the constitutionality of state and local laws requiring segregation in trains, buses, streetcars, waiting rooms and restaurants.
        The High Court ordered the Federal judiciary in Mississippi to uphold the right to unsegregated service, declaring that earlier Court decisions had already established the anti-segregation principle. National civil rights leaders called the case a major victory.
        In the 1960's, Mr. Bailey served as president of the Jackson branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. In 1963, he worked with Mr. Evers, the group's Mississippi field secretary, to register black voters. Mr. Evers was assassinated in June of that year.
        Mr. Bailey's daughter Verna, now of Portland, Ore., yesterday recalled being  the first black woman to enroll as an undergraduate at the University of Mississippi, saying that was in part because of her father. She graduated in 1968 with a degree in sociology and philosophy.
        Also surviving are his wife of 54 years, Lucille; a son, Thomas, of Seattle;  another daughter, Dr. Shirley B. Johnson of Miami; a brother, James, of St. Louis, and six grandchildren.
