        Stanley Soble, casting director for the Center Theater Group/Ahmanson Theater and the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, died on July 6 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was 59.
        The cause was complications after surgery, said a spokeswoman for the Mark Taper Forum.
        Mr. Soble was casting director at the Mark Taper for the world premiere productions of Tony Kushner's ''Angels in America'' and Robert Schenkkan's ''Kentucky Cycle,'' both of which went on to Broadway. His Broadway credits include ''Jelly's Last Jam,'' ''Big River,'' ''Moon for the Misbegotten'' and ''The Pirates of Penzance.''
        Born in Richmond, Mr. Soble studied theater at the College of William and Mary. His first job as a casting director was for the NBC soap opera ''Search for Tomorrow'' in 1978.
        He is survived by a sister, Sarah Coyne, and a brother, Paul.
