        Michael Aldridge, a veteran and versatile British actor who appeared on American television screens in British productions in roles that ranged from bumbling to gin-guzzling, died last Monday in London. He was 73 and lived in Greenwich, a borough of London on the south bank of the Thames.
        Mr. Aldridge flourished particularly on American television in the 1980's. He won critical praise in 1988 for his portrayal of a "marvelously fuddy-duddy" gentleman doing a bit of amateur sleuthing in "Charters and Caldicott," a six-part "Mystery" series on public television. And Mr. Aldridge's gin-guzzling was well received in 1987, when he portrayed a raffish journalist in "Charlie," a four-hour detective film on public television.
        In 1984, he played Sir Abraham Haphazard, a legal eagle impatient with any suggestion that morality has a role in the law, in "The Barchester Chronicles," a seven-episode public-television production.
        Mr. Aldridge was born in Glastonbury, England, and did his first stage-acting as a pupil at Gresham's School in Holt, England. He made his professional debut on the provincial stage in 1939.
        He is survived by his wife of 47 years, the former Kirsteen Rowntree, and three daughters.

        A picture yesterday with an obituary of the actor Michael Aldridge was published in error. The picture -- also erroneously reproduced in mirror image -- showed Robin Bailey, with whom he appeared in the PBS television series "Charters and Caldicott." The obituary also misstated the year the program was shown. It was 1986, not 1988. A correct picture of Mr. Aldridge appears today on page D23.
