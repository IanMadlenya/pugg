        Leon Thomas, a jazz singer known for his bellowing glottal-stop style in free jazz of the 1970's, died on Saturday at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx. He was 61 and lived in the Bronx.
        The cause was heart failure as a result of leukemia, Karen Dagneau, his tour manager, said.
        Mr. Thomas, who was born in East St. Louis, Ill., and studied music at Tennessee State University, moved to New York in 1958. With his stout tenor voice, he worked as a straight blues-jazz singer, performing with Count Basie and Mary Lou Williams in the mid-60's. But by then he had also begun to spend time with young jazz musicians, like Randy Weston and Pharoah Sanders, who were looking to Africa, the East and meditation for musical material.
        Onstage with Mr. Sanders in the late 60's Mr. Thomas developed his ululating singing style, which has been compared to African pygmy and American Indian singing techniques, and which he later called ''soularphone.'' He believed that his ancestors had given him his elastic throat articulation, he said, and henceforth always used it.
        Pharoah Sanders tracks like ''The Creator Has a Master Plan'' from 1969 and ''Hum-Allah-Hum-Allah-Hum Allah'' from 1970 were full of Mr. Thomas's wordless yodeling over band vamps. This kind of spiritual African-tinged soul-jazz has become known as ''kosmigroov.''
        After working with Mr. Sanders and making some of his own albums for the Flying Dutchman label, he spent two years with the band Santana. In the last few years he often sang at the Lenox Lounge in Harlem.
        Mr. Thomas is survived by a son, Amos, of the Bronx, and a brother, Curtis of St. Louis.
