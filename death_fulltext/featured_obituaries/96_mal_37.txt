        Yu-chieh Lee, head of the Lord of Universe Church in Taiwan, died on Dec. 26 in Nantow, Taiwan. He was 95. The cause was kidney failure, a spokesman said.
        Before he founded the church in 1980, he was publisher and editor of The Independent Evening Post in Taipei.
        The spokesman said the church emerged from the Chinese Taoist tradition and has an estimated worldwide membership of 100,000. Members practice a form of meditation called "quiet sitting" and offer prayers for humanity and peace. Mr. Lee set up more than 40 church halls in Taiwan and one in Rosemead, Calif.
        Survivors include his wife, Kuo Chun-hua; four sons, Tse-yi, Tse-tah and Tse-chi of Taipei, and James Tse-chien of Westfield, N.J.
