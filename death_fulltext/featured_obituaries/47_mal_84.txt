        Natan Brand, an Israeli pianist who specialized in the music of Schumann and Chopin, died on Monday at New York Hospital. He was 46 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Alix B. Williamson, his former press representative, said that he died of lymphoma.
        Mr. Brand was born in Jerusalem and made his performing debut as a soloist with the Israel Broadcasting Symphony Orchestra when he was 11 years old. He came to New York City in the mid-1960's for postgraduate studies at the Mannes College of Music, won the Concert Artists Guild competition in 1969, and made his New York recital debut that year.
        Mr. Brand was an energetic, demonstrative player who tended to program his concerts around central themes. In 1983, for example, he played three concerts at Alice Tully Hall, devoting them separately to sonatas, fantasies and etudes. He also played a series devoted fully to the music of Schumann, and in 1984 he made his Carnegie Hall debut playing concertos by Schumann and Chopin.
        In addition to performing, Mr. Brand served on the faculty of the Hebrew Arts School in Manhattan, and taught at the University of Tulsa and at the Taubman Institute at Amherst College.
        He is survived by his wife, Lori Hillman Brand; two sons, Jesse and Ari, of Manhattan; his mother, Mala Brand, and two brothers, Avram and Chaim Brand of Jerusalem.
