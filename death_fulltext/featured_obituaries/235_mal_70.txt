        William Denis Curtin, who joined The New York Times in 1962 while still in high school and worked there as a copy editor for most of four decades, died on Monday at his home in Breezy Point, Queens. He was 60.
        The cause was cardiac arrest, his wife, Eileen, said.
        Mr. Curtin graduated from Cardinal Hayes High School and attended Iona College for two years. He joined The Times when it was still possible for a 16-year-old student in the Bronx, his birthplace, to get a part-time job as a copy boy.
        He became a copy editor in 1969 in the financial news department. Except for four years at Forbes magazine in the early 1990's, his entire career was at The Times, for the last decade on the Metro copy desk.
        In the early 1980's, Mr. Curtin was a shop steward and a vice chairman of the Newspaper Guild's New York Times unit, and served as a trustee of the Guild-Times Benefits Fund.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by three daughters, Christina Curtin-Orsmond, Jennifer Curtin and Kathleen Curtin; a brother, Kevin; and two grandsons.
