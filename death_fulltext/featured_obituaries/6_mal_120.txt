        Hugh Bryant, baritone for the jazz and pop vocal group The Delta Rhythm Boys, collapsed and died while singing a tribute Wednesday at the funeral of the group's founder.
        Mr. Bryant, 58 years old, was singing the gospel hymn ''He Will Understand and Say Well Done'' in homage to Lee Gaines, who died of cancer July 15 at the age of 73. Mr. Bryant, who had lived in Finland for the last 15 years, apparently suffered a heart attack.
        The Delta Rhythm Boys were best known in the 1940's and 1950's, when they recorded with such jazz greats as Ella Fitzgerald, Count Basie, Jimmy Lunceford, Charlie Barnet, Ruth Brown and Les Paul.
        The group members began yearly tours of Europe in 1940 and moved to Europe in the mid-1950's, where they continued to perform.
        Mr. Bryant, who was born in New York City and grew up there, joined the group in 1962. He had performed on Broadway and toured with numerous jazz musicals in the 1930's and 1940's.
