        Jonathan B. Daniels, a former Wall Street investment banker and a mountain-climbing enthusiast, died on Sunday in an avalanche in the Tatra Mountains on the border between Poland and Czechoslovakia. He was 26 years old and lived in Boston.
        Mr. Daniels had been in Warsaw since late November with the Task Force for Company Assistance, a partnership of North American and Polish interests seeking to help Polish industry convert to private ownership in a market economy. Last weekend he was with three other Americans on a climbing trip when the avalanche struck, his family said. His companions were apparently unhurt.
        He was born in Boston and graduated in 1986 with highest honors from Dartmouth, where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. He worked for the Wall Street firms of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette and Bear Stearns before leaving on a round-the-world mountain-climbing trip 14 months ago. He spent the last year in Eastern Europe.
        Mr. Daniels is survived by his father, Belden, and his mother, Pamela, of Boston, and a brother, Andrew, of Watertown, Mass.
