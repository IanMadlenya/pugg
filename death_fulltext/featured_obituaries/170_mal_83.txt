        Paul Winterton, a British writer of crime and suspense novels who used the pseudonym Andrew Garve, died on Jan. 8 in a nursing home in the county of Surrey in southeastern England. He was 92 and a longtime resident of London.
        Dr. Robin W. Winks, a Yale historian and expert on detective fiction, wrote in 1992, ''Garve's sense of place is uncanny,'' notably in the cloak-and-dagger suspense novel ''Murder in Moscow'' (1951, Ulverscroft). Widely seen as Mr. Winterton's best book, it was enriched by his experience as the Moscow correspondent of a London newspaper during World War II.
        Thirty Garve novels came out from 1950 through 1978. The lighthearted ''Megstone Plot'' (1957), about an officer who exploits military secrets, was made into the 1959 movie ''A Touch of Larceny,'' starring James Mason and George Sanders. A 1949 novel written under the pseudonym Roger Bax, a sea drama that appeared in the United States with the title ''Two if by Sea,'' was made into the 1953 movie ''Never Let Me Go,'' starring Clark Gable and Gene Tierney. Mr. Winterton also wrote under the name Paul Somers.
        Born in Leicester in central England, he earned a bachelor's degree in 1928 from the London School of Economics.
        He was a founder of an authors' society, the Crime Writers' Association, in 1953.
        Mr. Winterton is survived by his wife, Audrey, as well as 2 sons, 2 daughters, 13 grandchildren and a number of great-grandchildren.
