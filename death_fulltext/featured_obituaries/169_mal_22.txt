        Norbert V. Osterland, the former president of Sperry & Hutchinson, the company that distributed S&H green stamps, died on Jan. 20 at his home in Souderton, Pa. He was 81.
        The cause was a stroke, his daughter, Jill Prescott, said.
        Mr. Osterland was named vice president for operations at S&H in 1961 and president in 1974. The green stamps, which consumers collected to trade for goods like blenders or toasters and which supermarkets and gas stations used to build brand loyalty, reached their peak of popularity in the 1960's, when the company had more than 800 redemption centers. He retired in 1977.
        Mr. Osterland attended Lafayette College in Easton, Pa., and served in the Army infantry during World War II.
        He worked in the retail and mail-order industries before joining S & H in 1952.
        In addition to his daughter, who lives in Zionsville, Pa., Mr. Osterland is survived by a son, Thomas N. Osterland of Norwell, Mass.; two brothers, Roland P. Osterland of Laconia, N.H., and Edmund Osterland of La Jolla, Calif.; four grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.
        Correction:  February 17, 2001, Saturday  An obituary on Feb. 7 about Norbert V. Osterland, a former business executive, misidentified the company of which he was president from 1974 to 1977. It was S&H Green Stamps, not Sperry & Hutchinson, the parent company.
