        Jack Donahue, an author and a former managing editor of The Houston Post, died Saturday at the Memorial City Medical Center in Houston. He was 73 years old and lived in Houston.
        He died of complications from emphysema, his family said.
        Mr. Donahue, a native of Waco, Tex., attended Baylor University and was a reporter and city editor on The Houston Press before he became managing editor of The Post in 1958. He resigned two years later.
        He wrote several books and was co-author with Leon Jaworski, the Watergate special prosecutor, of the best-selling book "The Right and the Power," published in 1976 by the Reader's Digest Press.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Gene Hughes; three sons, Michael, of Houston, Terry, of Austin, and Brian, of Wahiawa, Hawaii, and two grandchildren.
