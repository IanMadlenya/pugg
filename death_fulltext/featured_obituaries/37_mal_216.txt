        Cornell Gunter, the lead singer of the Coasters, the doo-wop group whose hit recordings in the late 1950's included ''Yakety Yak'' and ''Charlie Brown,'' was shot dead here in his car on Monday, the police said today. He was 53 years old.
        ''It appears he was shot through the windshield, and he was dead on the scene,'' said a police spokesman, Lieut. Gary Rainey. ''We don't have a motive at this time.'' Mr. Gunter, whose given name was Cornelius, was the second member of the group to die in a shooting in the Las Vegas area.
        Mr. Gunter and the Coasters were to perform at the Lady Luck Hotel this weekend, a hotel spokeswoman said.
        The other Coaster slain, Nathaniel (Buster) Wilson, was shot in the head in April 1980. His dismembered body was dumped near Hoover Dam and in a canyon near Modesto, Calif.
        Mr. Gunter, a tenor, joined the Coasters in 1957, two years after the group was formed in Los Angeles.
        With a flurry of hits that included ''Yakety Yak'' in 1957 and ''Charlie Brown,'' ''Along Came Jones'' and ''Poison Ivy'' in 1959, the Coasters were the nation's most popular black rock group at the end of the decade. The current ensemble is known as Cornell Gunter and His Coasters. In recent years, various band members headed groups billed as the Coasters.
        Mr. Gunter was a native of Los Angeles. In 1987, he was inducted into the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame.
