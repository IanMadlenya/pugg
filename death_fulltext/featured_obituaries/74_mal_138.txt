        Wesley McD. Holder, a Democratic politician who helped break racial barriers to elective office as a mentor to Mayor David N. Dinkins and other black officials in New York City, died on Monday at his home in Brooklyn. He was 95.
        The cause was pneumonia, his family said.
        In 1953 Mr. Holder organized the campaign that led to Lewis Flagg Jr.'s upset victory as the first black to be elected a judge in Brooklyn. Later Mr. Holder was campaign manager and chief aide to Shirley Chisholm, the nation's first black Congresswoman.
        He advised other blacks elected to the City Council, State Legislature, Congress and the courts. One beneficiary, Assemblyman Roger L. Green of Brooklyn, once admiringly described him as "the sly mongoose."
        Mr. Holder, known as Mac, was born in Guyana and moved to the United States in his 20's. After graduating from City College he joined Marcus Garvey's back-to-Africa movement. Jailed for Opposing Klan
        There he traveled cross-country, often running afoul of prejudice. For opposing the Ku Klux Klan, he was jailed in Miami. He recalled that when he was arrested for disturbing the peace in Arkansas, he requested a lawyer and was told the nearest one was in Oklahoma. He represented himself and was fined $5.
        In his varied career, Mr. Holder was a reporter and the Brooklyn editor for The Amsterdam News, a statistician for the War Products Board in Washington in World War II and a researcher for the Brooklyn district attorney. He also formed a literary society and debating club for black intellectuals.
        Mayor Edward I. Koch awarded him the city's La Guardia Medal in 1988.
        Surviving are his wife of 51 years, the former Thelma Herod; two daughters, Veronica Trewick and Marlene Holder, both of Brooklyn; a sister, Grace Gardner of Guyana; a brother, Basil, of Curacao, and one grandchild.
