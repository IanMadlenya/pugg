        Shirley Stoler, an actress best known for her role as the Nazi commandant in Lina Wertmuller's 1976 film ''Seven Beauties,'' died on Feb. 17 at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center of New York. She was 69 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was heart failure after a long illness, said her brother Ira.
        Ms. Stoler, a native of Brooklyn whose acting career spanned four decades, considered herself the first significantly fat actress to do dramatic roles rather than comedy. Her weight, which hovered around 250 pounds in her early years, limited her choices, she said in a 1976 interview with The New York Times. ''Weight shouldn't be a hindrance, but casting people are afraid of it,'' she said. ''I could play 'Medea,' but they wouldn't cast me for it.''
        Her imposing figure frequently landed Ms. Stoler the part of the villain or shrew, most notably in ''Seven Beauties,'' in which she played the sadistic commandant of a Nazi concentration camp to critical acclaim. Six years earlier, in Leonard Kastle's ''Honeymoon Killers,''  she played a predatory nurse executed for murder. Her film credits  also include ''The Deer Hunter'' and ''Klute.''
        Ms. Stoler appeared on Broadway as Lolita's mother in Edward Albee's 1981 stage adaptation of the Nabokov novel. She played villainous roles on many television series.
        In addition to her brother Ira, of Fairfield, Conn., she is survived by another brother, David, of Wanaque, N.J., and a sister, Miriam, of Delray Beach, Fla.
