        Stuart Black, a freelance writer and television and radio producer, died on Monday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 45 and also had a home in Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer of the esophagus and stomach, his family said.
        After working as a children's advocate on the Lower East Side, Mr. Black moved west in the mid-1970's to start a career as a writer. He wrote articles, mostly about sports, for various newspapers and magazines.
        He was a producer and a host for radio and television programs including ESPN's "Sports Look" and Madison Square Garden Network shows. He also wrote a number of books on sports, including a Scholastic Books series for children.
        Mr. Black was a native of the Bronx and attended City College. On the Lower East Side, he worked with runaways and gang members. In the summer of 1968, he and his sister, Michelle Cole, took 50 children on a three-month cross-country tour to show them other parts of the United States. Their experiences were chronicled by him and Mrs. Cole in a book, "Checking It Out" (1972).
        In addition to his sister, of Los Angeles, he is survived by his mother, Helen Black of Riverdale, the Bronx, and a nephew, Jarett Cole of Los Angeles.
