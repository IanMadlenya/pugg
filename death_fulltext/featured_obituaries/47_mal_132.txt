        Sidney Schutz, general counsel of Yeshiva University for more than three decades, died on Saturday at his home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. He was 75 years old.
        He died of cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Schutz, who was also an assistant professor of forensic medicine at the university's Albert Einstein College of Medicine for many years, became Yeshiva's general counsel in 1955 and retired in 1986.
        During his tenure the university underwent its greatest period of growth, establishing schools of medicine, law, social work and psychology and creating four teaching centers in Manhattan and the Bronx.
        Mr. Schutz was born in Manhattan and earned his law degree from New York University. He practiced law with the Manhattan firm of Arnstein & Levy before joining Yeshiva, and resumed law practice after his retirement with the firm of Schutz & Markin.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Louise Silverstein; a daughter, Caryn Markin of New Rochelle, N.Y.; a son, Samuel, of Riverdale; a sister, Regina Schechter of Miami Beach, and three grandchildren.
