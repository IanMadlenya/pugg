        John Kobal, who wrote many books about Hollywood and assembled an important collection of historical photographs of movie stars, died on Monday at his home in London. He was 51 years old.
        He died of pneumonia, said David Kent, a business associate.
        Born in Linz, Austria, Mr. Kobal moved with his family at an early age to Ottawa, where he grew up. In 1960, he went to London to study acting but arrived too late in the year to enroll in classes. Instead, he found an agent and spent the next four years touring in stock theater companies. In this period he first began to collect movie stills and memorabilia. First Book Was on Garbo
        In 1964 Mr. Kobal came to New York City, where he prepared news items and interviews for the BBC radio program "Movie Go Round." Through his contacts in the movie industry, he also began to build his collection of historical film photographs. In 1966 he published his first book, a pictorial biography of Greta Garbo produced in collaboration with the British film critic Raymond Durgnat.
        Mr. Kobal published nearly 30 books on the history of Hollywood movies, including "Gotta Sing, Gotta Dance: The American Film Musical," but his best-known works were based on his own collection.
        "The Art of the Great Hollywood Portrait Photographers" (1981) drew renewed attention to the work of important Hollywood glamour photographers like George Hurrell, C. S. Bull, Eugene Richee and Ted Allan. Shortly before his death, Mr. Kobal completed an authorized biography of Cecil B. DeMille, to be published by Alfred A. Knopf.
        Mr. Kobal is survived by his mother, a brother, a sister and four nephews, all of Ottawa.
