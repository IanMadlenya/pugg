        Robert Webber, a prolific character actor whose sleek appearance and clenched-jaw look made him believable as the elegant businessman of sleazy character he played in hundreds of films and television dramas, died of Lou Gehrig's disease yesterday at his home in Malibu, Calif. He was 64 years old.
        Mr. Webber, the son of a merchant seaman, was born in Santa Ana, Calif. He served in the Marine Corps during World War II, and in 1946 hitchhiked to New York City to become an actor. After more than two years in summer stock, he made his debut on Broadway in 1948 with a nine-line part in ''Two Blind Mice.'' His Broadway appearances included roles in ''The Royal Family,'' ''Goodbye, My Fancy,'' ''No Time for Sergeants,'' ''Orpheus Descending,'' ''Teahouse of the August Moon'' and ''Period of Adjustment.''
        Mr. Webber's first film appearance was in 1951 as a gangster in ''Highway 301.'' He went on to play in dozens of feature films - including ''12 Angry Men,'' ''The Great White Hope,'' ''Casey's Shadow,'' ''Revenge of the Pink Panther,'' ''10'' and ''Private Benjamin'' - and in hundreds of television shows, including episodes of ''Studio One,'' ''The Hallmark Hall of Fame,'' ''No Time for Sergeants,'' ''The Rockford Files,'' ''Cannon,'' ''Kojak'' and ''The Streets of San Francisco.''
        His most recent appearances were as Cybil Shepherd's father in ''Moonlighting'' and as the prosecutor in the Barbra Streisand film ''Nuts.''
        Mr. Webber recently said he had appeared in more than 400 television roles when he stopped counting in the early 1960's.
        He is survived by his wife, Del, and his father, Robert.
