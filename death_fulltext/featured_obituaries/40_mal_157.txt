        After four decades in private practice along with teaching assignments, Mr. Leary decided in 1977 to teach full time. He taught first at Temple University Law School in Philadelphia and later at the Delaware Law School of Widener University in Wilmington, from which he retired in 1987 as Distinguished Professor of Law.
        In between, he took a year off to serve as counsel in Washington for the Public Research Group under Ralph Nader.
        Mr. Leary, born to an old Virginia family in Washington, was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Princeton University in 1932 and received his law degree at Harvard in 1935. He worked for the New York law firm Shearman & Sterling before World War II.
        He was commissioned a lieutenant in the Army in 1942, rising to lieutenant colonel. In 1946, he came to Philadelphia to teach at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. He was also a partner in the law firm Schnader Harrison Segal & Lewis, and later in the firm Saul Ewing Remick & Saul, specializing as bond counsel for schools and other public projects.
        In his profession, he was known as an expert on the Uniform Commercial Code, which applies to many commercial practices in the United States.
        Mr. Leary is survived by his wife of 49 years, the former Sarah Lippincott O'Neill; a daughter, Sally Fairfax Englund of British Columbia; two sons, Michael B. of Haverford, Pa., and Brian F. of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; a sister, Neville C. Scull of Gladwyne, Pa., and five grandchildren.
