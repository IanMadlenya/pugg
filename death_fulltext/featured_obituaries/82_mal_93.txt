        Charles Brooks, a manufacturer of parts for the auto industry, died on Monday in his Manhattan apartment. He was 82.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Rabbi Arthur Schneier, senior rabbi of the Park East Synagogue, where Mr. Brooks was a trustee.
        Mr. Brooks founded the Cee-Bee Manufacturing Company in Brooklyn and the Campbell Plastic Company in Schenectady, manufacturers of plastics. Mr. Brooks developed the moldings for the doors of cars. He retired early this year.
        He is survived by a brother, Jack, of Fort Lee, N.J., and two sisters, Lillian Herman and Ida Kimmel, both of San Diego.
