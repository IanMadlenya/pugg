        Lillian Day Lederer, a novelist, biographer and playwright, died yesterday at the DeWitt Nursing Home in Manhattan, where she had lived for the last eight years. She was 98 years old.
        She died of heart failure, a cousin, Alexandra Lippman, said.
        She was a native New Yorker, the daughter of two prominent physicians of the 1890's, Dr. Alexander Abrams and Dr. Amelia Fendler.
        In the 1920's, she wrote magazine articles as Lillian Day, adopting the surname of her first husband.  In 1931, she wrote the novel "Kiss and Tell" and the next year she collaborated with her second husband, Lyon Mearson, on the novel "Our Wife." Later she was co-author of the mysteries "Murder in Time" and "Death Comes on Friday" with her third husband, Norbert Lederer.
        Her 1938 novel, "The Youngest Profession," was made into a film starring Edward G. Robinson. A play, "Collector's Item," written with Alfred Golden, had a short run on Broadway in 1952.
        In 1950 she moved to France, where she lived for nearly 30 years in Neuilly-sur-Seine and in Paris, where Mr. Lederer died.
        There are no immediate survivors.
