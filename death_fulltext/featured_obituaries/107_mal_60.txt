        Richard Blair Barnett, a lawyer specializing in maritime and aviation finance cases and a Kansas-bred champion of Greenwich Village and its history, died on Tuesday at St. Vincent's Hospital. A Village resident, he was 68.
        The cause was cancer, his law firm said.
        Mr. Barnett was a founding trustee of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation in 1980 and served as board president from 1987 to 1991. He also sat on the board of the Washington Square Association and the preservation committee of Community Board 2.
        A native of Topeka, Mr. Barnett graduated from Yale University in 1950 and received a law degree from the University of Michigan in 1953. That year he joined the Manhattan firm of Haight, Gardner, Poor & Havens. He was made a partner in 1966 and spent 42 years with the firm, leaving when his health failed him about three months ago.
        He was a prominent member of the Maritime Law Association of the United States and past chairman of its Committee on Marine Finance. He frequently lectured and wrote about his specialty, both in the United States and overseas.
        Mr. Barnett moved to Greenwich Village in 1954 and fought for the preservation of its character from then on. With Jane Jacobs, an urban historian, and others, he helped defeat an urban renewal plan that would have doomed a large chunk of it some years ago. He was also a force in campaigns for  the restoration of the Washington Square Arch and the designation of part of the Village's waterfront as a landmark.
        Mr. Barnett is survived by a sister, Barbara Grey of Teaneck, N.J., and a brother, David, of Topeka.
