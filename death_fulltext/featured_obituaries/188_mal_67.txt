        Robert O. Jordan, who helped create advertising campaigns for clients as diverse as Procter & Gamble and The National Enquirer, died Sunday at his home in Weston, Conn. He was 69.
        The cause was cancer, his wife, Susan, said.
        Mr. Jordan, whose career spanned five decades, led the New York operations of the Saatchi & Saatchi advertising agency. Throughout his career, he was closely affiliated with Procter & Gamble, which has long been one of the country's largest advertisers.
        Mr. Jordan was born in 1933 in Paris and received his early education in Europe. He graduated from Harvard University in 1954 and entered the United States Air Force.
        After leaving the military in 1956, Mr. Jordan joined Compton Advertising in its research department. At the time, Compton was the principal agency used by Procter & Gamble. Mr. Jordan eventually assumed responsibility for the company's account, developing advertisements for products including Tide, Ivory Soap and Top Job.
        He also attracted a number of clients to Compton, including The National Enquirer, and he helped develop a promotional campaign for the newspaper based on the slogan ''Inquiring Minds Want to Know.''
        In 1981, he was promoted to vice chairman at Compton, which at the time said it had more No. 1 brands and No. 1 clients than any other of the 500 agencies in the American Association of Advertising Agencies.
        A year later, Compton was acquired by Saatchi & Saatchi of Britain.
        Mr. Jordan was promoted in 1983 to become the chairman of Compton Advertising. This put him in charge of Saatchi & Saatchi's New York advertising office. He retired in 1988.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Alexandra, and two sons, David and Harrison, all of Weston; another son, Nicholas, of St. Paul; and a granddaughter. A son, Robert T. Jordan, died on Sept. 11 in the World Trade Center attack.
