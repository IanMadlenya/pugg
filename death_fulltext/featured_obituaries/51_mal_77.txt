        John G. Nesbett, founder of the New York mutual fund that became the Dreyfus Fund, died on Friday at Indian River Memorial Hospital in Vero Beach, Fla. He was 88 years old and lived in Vero Beach.
        He died of heart failure, his daughter-in-law, Jane, said.
        In 1947, running a small brokerage firm, he founded the Nesbett Fund. In 1951, when it had assets of less than $1 million, it was bought by Dreyfus & Co., another small brokerage firm that was entering the mutual-fund field. Dreyfus, which is now a giant in the funds and financial services field, turned it into the Dreyfus Fund which now has assets of about $2.5 billion. He retired in 1974.
        In World War II he was a commander of a submarine chaser.
        He was born in Bloomfield, N.J., and graduated from Cornell University.
        He is survived by his wife, Bess; a son, Daniel, of Darien, Conn., and two grandsons.
