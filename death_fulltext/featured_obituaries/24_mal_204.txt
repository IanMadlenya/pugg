        Dr. Lawrence Henry Chamberlain, a former dean of Columbia College and a retired vice president of Columbia University, died of a stroke Sunday at the Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula in Monterey, Calif. He was 82 years old and lived in Pacific Grove.
        Dr. Chamberlain received a bachelor's and a master's degree from the University of Idaho and was an assistant professor there before joining the faculty at Columbia University in 1941. He earned a Ph.D. in government at Columbia in 1945.
        Dr. Chamberlain, who served as a lieutenant in the Navy in World War II, was an assistant to the director of the naval Military School on campus. He was named an associate professor in 1947 and full professor in 1949. The next year Dr. Chamberlain was named dean of Columbia College, a position he held until 1958.
        As dean, he helped make it one of the leading undergraduate schools in the country. He returned to teaching as the Joseph L. Buttenwieser Professor of Human Relations at the University. He was named university vice president in 1962 and retired five years later.
        In 1963, while vice president of the university, Dr. Chamberlain was instrumental in developing a plan to help tenants evicted from Columbia-owned buildings in Morningside Heights. Two years later, he advocated communitywide planning to resolve conflicts between the institutions there and residents of the area.
        He is survived by his wife, Mildred.
