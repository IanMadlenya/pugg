        Dr. Louis Venet, a prominent breast-cancer specialist and surgeon who was associated with Beth Israel Medical Center for more than five decades, died on Feb. 21 at Waterbury Hospital and Health Center in Connecticut. He was 77 years old and lived in Southbury.
        He died after a long illness, his family said.
        Dr. Venet, a native of New York City with a medical degree from New York University, entered Beth Israel as an intern in 1937. He completed his residency in surgery in 1947 after service as a captain in the Army Medical Corps in World War II.
        His career focused on the early detection and successful treatment of breast cancer. As clinical investigator in a study for the Health Insurance Plan of New York, he became known for his research on the role of mammography and screening in reducing mortality rates. A grant from the National Cancer Institute dating from the 1960's financed his work. His research formed the basis for the medical profession's recommendation that women in certain age groups have a mammogram annually.
        Dr. Venet served as Beth Israel's director of medical education, training health professionals; as associate and acting director of surgery, and as a member and president of the Medical Board. He also sat on many committees and task forces charting the medical center's policies.
        Dr. Venet taught at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, Cornell Medical College, the University of North Carolina and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was a consultant to the National Cancer Institute and a four-term president of the New York City division of the American Cancer Society.
        Dr. Venet is survived by his wife, the former Wanda Robertson; a son, Daniel, of Chappaqua, N.Y.; two daughters, Katherine Venet of Manhattan and Margery Strauss of Queens; a sister, Ida Green of Los Angeles, and two grandchildren.
