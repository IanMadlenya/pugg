        William E. Chilton 3d, the firebrand publisher of The Charleston Gazette, died of a heart attack Saturday while playing in a squash tournament in Washington, D.C. He was 65 years old.
        Mr. Chilton, whose loudly-proclaimed philosophy of ''sustained outrage'' shaped the newspaper's editorial crusades against government corruption and social wrongs, collapsed after losing an afternoon match in the Woodruff-Nee Tournament at the University Club.
        Born in Kingston, N.Y., Mr. Chilton grew up in Charleston. He inherited a tradition of liberal newspapers and Democratic politics from his grandfather, a lawyer, coal operator and United States Senator from West Virginia who bought The Gazette in 1907.
        As publisher of The Gazette since 1961, Mr. Chilton exhorted his staff to expose wrongdoing by public officials, often by bellowing orders from his office off the newsroom. Gazette editorials, which he often wrote, evoked fear, hatred or admiration, but rarely indifference, especially among those singled out for praise or reproach.
        He became the newspaper's promotions director after graduating from Yale University in 1950. Later, he served in the State House of Delegates and was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1960 and 1964.
        A frequent target of Gazette criticism was Governor Arch A. Moore Jr., a Republican. After the newspaper uncovered questionable activities by top Moore appointees, several of whom went to prison in the 1970's, the Governor dubbed it ''the morning sickcall.''
        Mr. Chilton was an ardent supporter and close friend of Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, the former Democratic Governor who started his political career in West Virginia in the 1960's.
