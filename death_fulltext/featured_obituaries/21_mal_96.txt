        Mr. Schiffmacher contributed greatly to the real-estate development of the Great Neck peninsula after World War II, his law partners said.
        He had been the village attorney for Great Neck, Great Neck Plaza and Thomaston, L.I., and counsel to the Great Neck and Herricks school districts, the Great Neck Library and the North Hempstead Housing Authority.
        He served as special counsel to other Long Island villages and agencies, incorporated the Great Neck Symphony Society in the early 1960's, and served as counsel to the Community Church of Great Neck, to which he belonged.
        He was the president of the Nassau County Bar Association in 1974-75 and oversaw an expansion of the group's headquarters in Mineola, L.I. He also served on the Governor's Judicial Scrreening Committee for the Second Department.
        Mr. Schiffmacher, who was born in Lynbrook, L.I., and grew up in Baldwin, L.I., attended Trinity College and graduated from Brooklyn Law School in 1933. He began his career as an associate of a Great Neck lawyer, E.K. Dodge. In 1939, he started his own firm, which became Schiffmacher, Cullen, Farrell & Limmer. He retired from active practice five years ago.
        He is survived by his wife, Rita, and a son, Craig, of Manhasset, L.I.
