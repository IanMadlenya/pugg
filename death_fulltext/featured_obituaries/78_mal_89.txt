        Peter Coni, a former chairman of the annual Henley Royal Regatta, the world's most famous rowing event, died Tuesday in London. He was 57 years old and lived in London.
        The cause was a heart attack, The Times of London reported.
        Mr. Coni, a practicing lawyer, chaired the management committee of the regatta from 1977 until January of this year, when he resigned because of ill health. The regatta is held in early summer at Henley-on-Thames, 17 miles west of London.
        In 1983, Mr. Coni allowed women to row in the regatta for the first time, in exhibition races. But he deemed the experiment a failure, and women were excluded until this year's regatta.
        His ban on women caused a furor, but Mr. Coni asserted that what he called the "women's squealing" was "more noisy, stupid and harmful to their cause than anything I can think of." He also maintained a ban on spectators in short skirts.
        During his tenure, Mr. Coni increased the regatta's duration to five days from four and oversaw the financing and construction of a new headquarters building.
        Peter Richard Carstairs Coni was born in Wellington, New Zealand, began rowing while he was a student at Cambridge University and later became president of the London Rowing Club. He was chairman of the 1986 World Rowing Championships Committee and a member of Britain's National Olympic Committee.
