        John T. Galvin, a public relations executive and political author who played a leading role in the redevelopment of Boston in the 1950's and 1960's, died Monday at Youville Hospital in Cambridge, Mass.
        Mr. Galvin was 79 and lived in Boston and Edgartown, Mass.
        The cause of death was coronary artery disease, said his wife, Ruth Mehrtens Galvin.
        Mr. Galvin was the co-founder and for 37 years the chief architect of the Boston Citizen Seminars at Boston College, which bring together scholars and leaders from business, labor and politics to discuss solutions for concerns raised about the city of Boston.
        He began his career with the Boston Community Fund Campaign, now the United Way, in 1940. After World War II, he became public relations director of the John C. Dowd Advertising Agency.
        Mr. Galvin was executive vice president of the World Trade Center in New England from 1957 to 1966 and public relations director for Tufts-New England Medical Center.
        In 1970 Mr. Galvin's book, "Twelve Mayors of Boston, 1900-1970," was published by the Boston Public Library.
        He was an associate commissioner of the Boston Parks Department during the administration of Mayor Raymond L. Flynn.
        He is survived by his wife, Ruth Mehrtens Galvin.
