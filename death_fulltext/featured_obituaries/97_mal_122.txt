        William Way Watkins, a chemist who did early research in the development of the synthetic fibers Orlon and Dacron, died on Wednesday in the White Horse Village retirement home in Newtown Square, Pa. He was 83 and had been a resident of Swarthmore, Pa., for more than 40 years.
        The cause was Parkinson's disease, said his daughter, Anne Watkins, of Cape May Court House, N.J.
        In 1936, after receiving a doctorate in chemistry from Harvard University, he worked for E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, where he was on the research team that developed nylon in 1942. He was also the research manager for the development of Orlon, Dacron and other synthetic fibers. He retired in 1974.
        Dr. Watkins was born in Cleveland and earned an undergraduate degree from Ohio Wesleyan University in 1933.
        In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his wife of 57 years, Janet Gibson Watkins; a son, Robert, of Harvard, Mass.; two sisters, Louise Crane of Cleveland and Jane Cristie of Chagrin Falls, Ohio; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
