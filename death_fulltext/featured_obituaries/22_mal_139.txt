        Max H. Goldschein, a lawyer who brought cases against organized crime figures in a 24-year career in the Federal Justice Department, died Monday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. He was 89 years old.
        Mr. Goldschein was a special assistant to the Attorney General from 1942 until 1966. In World War II he prosecuted clothing manufacturers for fraud under Government war contracts. After the war he handled cases against gangsters in Kansas City, Los Angeles, New York and other cities.
        In the late 1940's he was assigned as counsel to a House of Representatives subcommittee headed by Estes Kefauver of Tennessee, who began the investigations that were to lead to his later inquiries into organized crime as a Senate Investigations Committtee chairman.
        Mr. Goldschein, a native of Brooklyn, received his law degree from Cumberland College in Tennessee. He practiced in Nashville and was named Attorney General of Davidson County before going to Washington.
        His wife, the former Fannie Schmertzler, died last year, after which he moved to Roslyn from West Palm Beach, Fla. He is survived by a daughter, Barbara Blechman of Roslyn; a son, Charles, of Arlington, Va., and seven grandchildren.
