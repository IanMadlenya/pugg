        Peter T. Farrell, who had a long career as a judge on the Queens County Court and the New York State Supreme Court, died yesterday at his home in Manhasset, L.I. He was 91 years old.
        He died of pneumonia, said his son-in-law, Robert Phillips.
        Judge Farrell, who handled only criminal cases through most of his career, presided over the 1952 trial of Willie Sutton, the bank robber.
        He was elected to the Queens County Court in 1943 and remained on it until 1961, when it was absorbed into the Supreme Court. From 1945 to 1961 he was the senior judge on the Queens court. He was the senior judge on the Supreme Court, Criminal Term, Queens County from 1961 until his retirement in 1976.
        Mr. Sutton was found guilty of stealing $63,942 in 1950 from the Sunnyside branch of the Manufacturers Trust Company. That verdict in a Long Island City courthouse ended his criminal career. Mr. Sutton later estimated that he had stolen more than $2 million from banks.
        Mr. Sutton was sentenced to 30 to 120 years at Attica State Prison, but was released in 1969, reportedly suffering from emphysema. He died in 1980.
        Judge Farrell, a Democrat, was born in Manhattan, grew up in Corona, Queens, and earned a B.A. from Cornell in 1922 and a law degree from Fordham in 1925. He served as an Assemblyman from Corona from 1929 to 1936, and as a State Senator from northern Queens from 1936 to 1943.
        He is survived by his wife of 61 years, the former Agnes Byrne; two sons, Robert of Albany and Stephan of Manhattan; two daughters, Ann FitzPatrick of Manhasset and Lois Phillips of Old Brookville, L.I., and 10 grandchildren.
