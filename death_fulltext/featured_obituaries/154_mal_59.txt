        The Rev. Dr. Thaddeus A. Garrett Jr., an Ohio minister in the A.M.E. Zion Church who became a Republican adviser on national urban and racial affairs, died on Monday at George Washington University Medical Center in Washington. He was 51.
        The cause was kidney failure, said Wesley Temple A.M.E. Zion Church in Akron, Ohio, where Dr. Garrett, who worked as a consultant in Washington, was an associate minister.
        Dr. Garrett was a longtime Republican, although in the early 1970's he was an aide to Representative Shirley Chisholm, a liberal Democrat from Brooklyn.
        Born in Akron, Dr. Garrett graduated from the University of Akron and earned a doctorate of divinity at Howard University. He became chairman of the trustees at Howard, where he taught political science, and was a trustee of Livingstone College in Salisbury, N.C.
        Dr. Garrett is survived by his father, Thaddeus Sr., and brother, Gordon, both of Akron; and two sisters, Denise McCoy of Columbus, Ohio, and Constance Lykes of Fort Washington, Md.
