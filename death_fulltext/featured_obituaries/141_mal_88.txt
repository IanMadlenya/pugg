        Charlton Ogburn, a former State Department official and the author of novels and books about World War II and Shakespeare, died on Monday at his home in Beaufort, S.C. He was 87.
        Mr. Ogburn's best-known book was ''The Mysterious William Shakespeare: The Myth and the Reality'' (1984), in which he tried to demonstrate ''that the poems and plays we know as Shakespeare's were the work of a nobleman employing a pseudonym.'' He insisted that sufficient evidence pointed to Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford, as the man behind the pseudonym.
        Born in Atlanta, Mr. Ogburn was a graduate of Harvard University. During World War II he served in the Pacific with a military unit whose exploits behind Japanese lines in Burma under the command of Brig. Gen. Frank D. Merrill earned it the name Merrill's Marauders. Some 15 years afterward, he wrote about his experiences in that campaign in ''The Marauders.'' A movie adaptation of the book, ''Merrill's Marauders,'' appeared in 1962.
        After the war, Mr. Ogburn worked in Army Intelligence and then as a policy planner in the State Department. Mr. Ogburn's other books included two novels (''The Gold of the River Sea,'' ''Winespring Mountain''), several adventures for younger readers, and celebrations of the glories of nature.
        He is survived by his wife, Vera; two daughters, Myssa Raymond of St. Petersburg, Fla., and Dr. Holly Ogburn Martin of Kennesaw, Ga.; a son, Will Aldis Ogburn of Pacific Palisades, Calif., and three grandchildren.
