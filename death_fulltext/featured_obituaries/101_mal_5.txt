        Richard Lewis Robbins, an environmentalist who also was an expert on law firm technology, died on Sunday at his home in Chicago. He was 56.
        His family said only that he died after a brief illness.
        As executive director of the Lake Michigan Federation, a private, nonprofit  environmental group, from 1975 to 1981, Mr. Robbins led efforts to clean up the  Great Lakes. In 1981, he opened a private practice in environmental law.
        A fascination with computers and technology paralleled his concern with planning and the environment. An electrical engineering undergraduate from Cornell University in 1961, he received a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1964.
        After further study in computer technology at Yale University, he went into city planning and zoning, first working in New York City for Mayor John V. Lindsey and, then, joining the Land Guard Trust in Gray, Me. He moved to Chicago in 1973 to work for American Society of Planning Officials.
        By 1984, as director of the American Bar Association Technology Advisory Council, he evaluated software programs for lawyers. He became editor and publisher of Computer Counsel, a monthly journal on law office automation and productivity. He also was author of "The Automated Law Firm" (Prentice Hall, 1986.)
        His marriage to Shellie Keir ended in divorce in 1990. He is survived by his  parents, Mayer and Esther Robbins of West Hartford, Conn.; a daughter, Hannah of Wilmette, Ill.; a brother, Alan of Bolton, Conn., and two sisters, Susan Robbins Namerow of Avon, Conn., and Carolyn Robbins Siegel of Albuquerque, N.M.
