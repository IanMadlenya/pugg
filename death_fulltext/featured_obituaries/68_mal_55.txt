        William R. Leisher, a paintings conservator and the executive director of the department of conservation at the Art Institute of Chicago, died on Wednesday at his home in Evanston, Ill. He was 51 years old.
        He died of cancer, said Eileen Harakal, the executive director of public affairs at the institute.
        Mr. Leisher was an expert in the field of conservation, working on paintings from the Renaissance through the 20th century, including those by Dirk Bouts, Chardin, Monet, Jackson Pollock and Anselm Kiefer. Before joining the institute in 1985, he was head of conservation at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art for five years, overseeing the design, construction and staffing of the museum's new conservation center, which is considered among the country's best.
        From 1973 to 1980, he was assistant conservator for paintings at the National Gallery of Art in Washington. In 1982, he was named to the board of the National Institute for Conservation of Cultural Property in Washington, becoming its president in 1989.
        He was born in Alden, Mich., on Feb. 9, 1941, and served in the Navy for four years before attending Michigan State University.
        He is survived by his wife, Doris, a son, Gregory, and a daughter, Christina, all of Evanston, and by a brother, James, of Oscoda, Mich.
