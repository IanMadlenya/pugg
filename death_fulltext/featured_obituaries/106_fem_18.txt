        Primrose Bordier, a French designer known for her colorful and innovative home textiles, died on Tuesday at the Cochin Hospital in Paris. She was 66 and lived in Paris.
        The cause was pulmonary disease, said Carole Weisweiller, a friend.
        During a trip to New York in the early 1960's for Le Printemps, the department store, for which she was a design director, Ms. Bordier noted the use of color in sheets and towels, at the time unknown in Europe. Upon starting a company in 1962, she persuaded manufacturers to produce colored sheets and towels. Her bed-linen collections had delicate, often humorous designs in subtle color combinations that became classics.
        In 1976, Ms. Bordier was the first woman in design to receive the French Legion of Honor.
        Ms. Bordier was born in Paris. In 1966, she married Charles Henri Gombault, the editor in chief of the newspaper France-Soir. She is survived by a brother,  Francis Bordier of Mandelieu, France, and by two stepchildren, Nadine Aiello Gombault of Mount Shasta, Calif., and Jean-Claude Gombault of Paris.
