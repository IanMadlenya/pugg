        Otavio Gouveia de Bulhoes, a Finance Minister under Brazil's former military leadership and a major force in national economic planning for nearly five decades, died Saturday of respiratory failure. He was 84 years old.
        Mr. Bulhoes, a proponent of deregulation and free-market economics, died at his home here, the Globo television network said.
        After a military coup in 1964 ousted President Joao Goulart, a leftist, Mr. Bulhoes was named Finance Minister by the new leader, Gen. Humberto Castelo Branco. Democratic rule was restored in Brazil in 1985.
