        Charles J. Simon, a retired general partner at Salomon Brothers investment bank and a philanthropist, died on Wednesday at home in Manhattan. He was 83.
        He had been in failing health with varied ailments, said Steve Loeb, his lawyer.
        Henry Kaufman, a former partner at Salomon, said Mr. Simon was a major contributor to the firm's growth. He specialized in promoting sales to banks and in giving investment advice. His career at Salomon started in the 1930's, and he rose to general partner in 1946. In 1976, he assumed a part-time role as a limited partner, which he continued until his death.
        Mr. Simon, who had served as the treasurer of the Whitney Museum of American Art, was on the museum's board for 23 years. He was also a director of the 92d Street Y and a trustee of the Museum of the American Indian and the Animal Medical Center.
        Born in Manhattan, he grew up in Long Beach, L.I., and graduated from the College of William and Mary and the New York University Graduate School of Business. In 1990, he endowed a chair at the N.Y.U. school in applied financial economics for the study of the financial service industry.
        He is survived by a half-brother, Henry, of Sherman Oaks, Calif.; a daughter, Patricia Clerc, of Normandy, France; a granddaughter and a great-grandson.
