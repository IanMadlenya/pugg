        Dorothy Ryan, who was one of the victims of her son in the nation's worst mass murder, was buried today after a simple funeral attended by about 50 people.
        Mrs. Ryan, 60 years old, was buried in Calne, in southern England, about 20 miles from the town of Hungerford, where she lived with her 27-year-old son, Michael.
        Mr. Ryan, who shot himself after killing 16 people in his hometown on Aug. 19, will be buried separately and not in Hungerford.
        ''There was a desolation of the spirit over her death,'' Canon John Reynolds told the congregation, which included Mrs. Ryan's sister, Nora, and her husband, Steve Fairbrass.
        Mr. Ryan's father, Alfred, died of cancer two years ago.
