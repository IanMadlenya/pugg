        Jack Lipman, the founder and president of Drizzle, a raincoat manufacturing company, died on Wednesday at Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 61 and lived in New York City.
        The cause of death was leukemia, said his sister-in-law, Naomi Lipman.
        Mr. Lipman began his career in the executive training program at Bloomingdale's before founding Drizzle 25 years ago. He was a past president of the New York Raincoat Association, a trade organization.
        He was born in New York City and given the name Ira, but he was always known as Jack. His father, Louis, was a founding partner of Lipman Brothers, a coat manufacturer that eventually changed its name to Cuddlecoat and is still run by members of the Lipman family.
        In addition to his wife, Jane, Mr. Lipman is survived by two sons, Steven and Brian, both of New York City; a daughter, Debbe Callaghan of Chatham, N.J., and two brothers, Dr. Marvin Lipman of Scarsdale, N.Y., and Samuel Lipman of East Brunswick, N.J.
