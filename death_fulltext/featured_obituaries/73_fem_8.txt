        Elsie Coulson Bloch, a fabric stylist and colorist, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 83 and lived in Manhattan and Kempton, Pa.
        The cause was heart failure, her family said.
        A native of Malta, Mrs. Bloch was raised in the Channel Islands and London. She worked at Duraloom Carpet Mills in the Bronx, where her husband, Godfrey Bloch, was president.
        Mrs. Bloch also renovated brownstone homes in New York City. She was president of the Daughters of the British Empire in New York State and was made a member of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II.
        Mrs. Bloch's husband died in 1987. She is survived by a daughter, Anne Snee, and a son, Godfrey C., both of Manhattan.
