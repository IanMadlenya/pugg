        Sadamichi Hirasawa, believed to have been on death row longer than any other prisoner in the world, died today of pneumonia in a medical detention center in suburban Hachioji, a hospital official said. Mr. Hirasawa was 95 years old.
        Mr. Hirasawa, an artist, had been a prisoner since 1948, when he was arrested and charged in the poisoning of 12 people during a bank robbery.
        He was convicted and sentenced to death in 1950. The sentence was confirmed in 1955, and he was sent to death row to await execution by hanging.
        In the robbery, a man posing as a Government health worker entered a Teikoku Bank branch and told 16 employees that post-World War II occupation forces had ordered them to drink medicine because of an outbreak of dysentery. The workers obeyed, and, as they collapsed, the robber scooped up the equivalent of $600 and fled.
        Twelve bank employees died. The drink was found to contain cyanide.
        Several books have cast doubt on evidence used to convict Mr. Hirasawa, and since 1950 none of Japan's Justice Ministers, who must approve executions, have agreed to order his death.
