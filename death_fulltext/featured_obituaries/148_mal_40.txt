        Dr. Stanley Lawrence Rosenthal, a former Government meteorologist who advanced the technology of tracking the formation and movements of hurricanes, died on April 24 at his home in Miami. He was 69.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Rosenthal spent 33 years with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a branch of the Department of Commerce. From 1977 to 1993, he directed the Hurricane Research Division in Florida, leading it through the devastation of the Miami area by Hurricane Andrew in 1992.
        His division is part of the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratories, and he played a pivotal role in the development of a three-dimensional hurricane model that is now widely used.
        Mr. Rosenthal was born in Brooklyn and graduated from City College of New York in 1951. He earned an M.S. degree at Florida State University in 1953 and then spent two years in the Army as a weather forecaster. He later returned to Florida State and received his Ph.D. in 1958. Two years later, he joined the staff of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
        After retiring in 1993, he was a senior research associate at the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Miami. He was a fellow of the American Meteorological Society and sat on its committee on hurricanes and tropical meteorology.
        The Commerce Department in Washington honored him with its Gold Medal in 1970.
        Dr. Rosenthal is survived by his wife of 45 years, Mildred Farlow Rosenthal; two sons, Russell K. and David S., both of Miami; a daughter, Sarah Lynn Rosenthal of Tallahassee, Fla., and four grandchildren.
