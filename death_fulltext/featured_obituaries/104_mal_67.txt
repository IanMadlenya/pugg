        Martin Gordon, a former Manhattan dealer in prints and drawings, died on Friday at the Lee Memorial Hospital in Fort Myers, Fla. He was 56 and lived in Naples, Fla.
        The cause was prostate cancer, said Judith Goldberg, a friend.
        He graduated from the Rochester Institute of Technology and in 1963 opened his gallery, Martin Gordon Inc., on Madison Avenue, where he remained until 1978, when he began working at home. He moved the business to Florida in 1989.
        He was a founder of the International Fine Print Dealers Association and published several books on graphics in the 1970's. He also issued "Gordon's Print Price Annual" from 1970 through 1995.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Gayle Gunderman; a daughter, Kelly; a son, Jeffrey, and his mother, Ruth Gordon, all of Naples.
