In the late 1950's he was a vice president and director of radio and television for MacManus, John & Adams in New York. Later he was director of communications for U.S. News & World Report, the magazine founded and published by his father, David Lawrence. He spent the last years of his career working for several Boston agencies, including Ingalls Associates, where he was senior writer.
