        Howard E. Buhse, an investment broker and Wall Street leader for many years, died on Thursday in the Washington Hospital Center in Washington. Mr. Buhse, who lived in Danbury, Conn., was 88.
        The cause was a stroke, said his daughter Deborah Plonski.
        During a Wall Street career that spanned 15 years, Mr. Buhse was president of the Bond Club of New York, a governor of the New York Stock Exchange, and the chairman of the board of the National Association of Securities Dealers.
        In 1929 Mr. Buhse went to work as a securities salesman in Chicago with Hornblower & Weeks, becoming a partner in 1942. In 1957 he moved to New York to head Hornblower & Weeks, which eventually became Hornblower & Weeks-Hemphill Noyes. He became managing partner and chairman of the executive committee.
        Retiring from the firm in 1971, at his death Mr. Buhse was an investment adviser and a shareholder of Noyes Partner in New York.
        Mr. Buhse was a graduate of the University of Minnesota and its law school.
        He is survived by a son, Howard Jr. of Chicago; two daughters, Mrs. Plonski of Danbury and Joan Bose of Saratoga, Calif., and 11 grandchildren.
