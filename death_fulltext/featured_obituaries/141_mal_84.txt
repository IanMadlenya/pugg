        James P. McFadden, an editor, publisher and prominent Roman Catholic layman, died on Oct. 17 at his home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He was 68.
        The cause was an esophageal hemorrhage, and he also had cancer, said William F. Buckley Jr., editor at large of National Review, where Mr. McFadden was on staff for more than 25 years, 12 of them as associate publisher.
        Mr. McFadden had been the editor of The Human Life Review, a quarterly journal of scholarship opposed to abortion, since he founded it in 1974. He had also been chairman of the National Committee of Catholic Laymen since founding it in 1977.
        A native of Youngstown, Ohio, he graduated in 1953 from Youngstown College and was in the Army from 1954 to 1956.
        Surviving are his wife, Faith; three daughters, Maria Maffucci of Manhattan, the executive editor of Human Life Review, Regina McFadden of Brooklyn and Christina McFadden of Manhattan; a son, Patrick, of Los Angeles; two grandchildren; two brothers, Edward, of Staten Island and Thomas, of Santa Monica, Calif., and three sisters, Rita Ward of San Francisco, Louise Boelger of Sun City West, Ariz., and Jean Jenkins of Youngstown.
