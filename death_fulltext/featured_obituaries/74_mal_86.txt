        Peter Dean, a figurative expressionist painter, died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 58 and also had a home in Elizaville, N.Y.
        The cause was amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, his family said.
        Mr. Dean was born in Berlin in 1934 and immigrated to the United States with his family in 1938. He grew up in the Bronx and earned a bachelor's degree in geology from the University of Wisconsin in 1956. For several years, he worked for the Anaconda Copper Company in Brazil, Montana and Nevada while also pursuing his painting, which at that point was influenced by the dark colors and exaggerated figures of Georges Roualt.
        In 1962, Mr. Dean returned to New York City. He had his first one-man show in 1963 at the Aspects Gallery on East 10th Street. By then, his style had progressed to colorful, aggressively painted works that tended to be crowded with figures and often depicted allegorical or political themes.
        In the late 1960's, he joined Benny Andrews, Jay Milder, Bill Barrell and others to form Rhino Horn, a group of figurative artists who exhibited together several times. Mr. Dean was represented in New York City by the Allan Stone Gallery in the 1970's and by the Semaphore Gallery for most of the 1980's. A retrospective of his work was held at the North Dakota Museum of Art in Grand Forks in 1989.
        Mr. Dean's work is represented in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the National Gallery of Art in Washington and the Ghent Museum of Modern Art in Belgium.
        He is survived by his wife, Lorraine, and a son, Gregory, both of Manhattan, and a sister, Marion Wollmeringer of Framingham, Mass.
