        Mr. Foster joined the commission in 1935 after having taught law at Harvard and Yale. He was put in charge of overseeing the liquidation of utility-holding companies mandated by Roosevelt's New Deal legislation.
        In 1944 Mr. Foster was appointed solicitor of the commission and in 1948 he became general counsel, a post he held until he resigned in 1953 to make way for an appointee of the new President, Dwight D. Eisenhower. He went into private law practice, but in 1966 he returned to the commission, where he served four years until retirement.
        Mr. Foster, who was born in St. Paul, was a graduate of Yale and of the Harvard Law School.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Genevieve Bartlett Wakeman; a daughter, Jane Buckwalter of Brooklyn; a son, Roger Jr. of Burlington, Vt.; a stepson, Charles Wakeman of Hickory, N.C., 10 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
