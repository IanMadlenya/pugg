        Arthur Naftalin, who led Minneapolis through the turbulent 1960's as a four-term mayor, died there on Monday. He was 87.
        The cause was complications of a fall, his family said.
        Though Dr. Naftalin served as mayor for eight years, they were not his first brush with the office. In the late 1940's, he was secretary to one of the city's most illustrious mayors, Hubert H. Humphrey, who went on to become a senator and Lyndon B. Johnson's vice president.
        Arthur Naftalin was born in Fargo, N.D. He graduated in 1939 from the University of Minnesota, where he also received a master's degree and a Ph.D. in political science. He worked as a newspaperman before returning to his alma mater in 1947 as an associate professor in the political science department. After his years as mayor, he went back to the university again, and retired in 1986 from the Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs there. He was a professor emeritus at his death.
        Dr. Naftalin was active in the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party and was an associate of two of its other leading members, former Gov. Orville L. Freeman and Vice President Walter F. Mondale.
        The nation's racial unrest of the 1960's touched Minneapolis, and as mayor Dr. Naftalin needed help from the National Guard in 1967 to calm disturbances in a section of north Minneapolis.
        He is survived by his wife of 63 years, Frances Healy Naftalin; two sons, Mark H., of Westport, Conn., and David M., of Los Angeles; a daughter, Gail Marie Naftalin of Silver Spring, Md.; and five grandchildren.
