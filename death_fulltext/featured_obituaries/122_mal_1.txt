        Louis A. Botto, the founder and artistic director of Chanticleer, an a cappella men's choir, died on Tuesday at his home in San Francisco. He was 45.
        Agnes Bruneau, the press representative for the choir, said the cause was AIDS.
        Mr. Botto, a tenor, formed Chanticleer in 1978 and remained one of its singers until 1989, when he decided to devote himself fully to his administrative tasks as artistic director. By then Chanticleer was performing about 100 concerts each season, touring and making recordings.
        The group specialized in Renaissance choral music at first, but soon expanded its purview. Under Mr. Botto's directorship, it commissioned works from several composers, including Chen Yi, Peter Schickele, Morton Gould, Bernard Rands, Augusta Reade Thomas and Anthony Davis.
        Mr. Botto was born in Texas and was a graduate of Incarnate Word College in San Antonio. In the early 1970's he was the director of the First Repertory Company of San Antonio. He completed his master's degree in musicology at Dominican College in San Rafael, Calif.
        Besides his work with Chanticleer, Mr. Botto performed with the San Francisco Symphony Chorus and the Grace Cathedral Choir of Men and Boys, and sang principal roles in early-music productions at the San Francisco Chamber Opera and at the University of California at Berkeley.
        He is survived by his companion, Eric Reiner, and his mother, Edythe K. Botto of San Antonio.
