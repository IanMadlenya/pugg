        Francisco Villarreal, a rebellious border city mayor who once went to jail for taking over an international bridge in defiance of the federal Government, died on Sunday. He was 65.
        Mr. Villarreal died of lymphatic cancer. He also had Parkinson's disease.
        Mr. Villarreal served as mayor of Ciudad Juarez, which is across the border  from El Paso, Texas, from 1992 until 1995.
        Last year, he led a takeover of the international Paso del Norte Bridge to protest the federal Government's practice of keeping all funds generated by bridge tolls.
        Protesters acting with his authorization collected tolls from makeshift booths while waving motorists past the bridge's federal toll booths.
        He contended that Mexico needed to move to a true federal system, where power and money were shared by national, state and local governments.
        He spent five days in jail for his actions before federal officials dropped charges.
        Shortly before leaving office late last year, Mr. Villarreal carried out another bridge toll protest. During that protest, he moved into a metal hut at the foot of the bridge and went on a hunger strike for several weeks.
