        Dr. Clinton Nathan Woolsey, a neuroscientist at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, died Thursday at Meriter Hospital in Madison. A resident of Madison, he was 88.
        The university said he had died after a brief illness,
        Professor Woolsey was the Charles Sumner Slichter Emeritus Professor of Neurophysiology. His research concerned mapping the brain and exploring the location and workings of three senses: touch, hearing and vision. A scholar in evolution, he conducted comparative studies of the brains of various animal species.
        He held the Slichter professorship from 1948 to 1975, during which time students, postdoctoral fellows and doctors came to work under him from across the United States and overseas.
        Professor Woolsey also had an important role in creating the university's Waisman Center on Mental Retardation and Human Development. He wrote or edited more than 60 papers and books.
        A native of Brooklyn, he received his medical degree from Johns Hopkins University in 1933. He remained there as a faculty member in the department of physiology until moving to Wisconsin in 1948.
        Professor Woolsey is survived by his wife of 50 years, the former Harriet Runion; three sons, Dr. Thomas A., of St. Louis, John D., of Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., and Edward A., of Madison; a sister, Gladyce McLearen of El Paso, and four grandchildren.
