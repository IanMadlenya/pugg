        Julko Litewka, the general secretary of the Jewish Labor Bund, a constituent member of Socialist International, died on Sunday at his home in the Bronx. He was 79 years old.
        He died of Hodgkin's disease, his son Albert said.
        Mr. Litewka, a native of Poland, joined the bund there at the age of 10 and served as youth secretary from 1933 until 1939. He came to the United States two years later, sponsored by the Jewish Labor Committee, and worked as a garment presser while picking up his leadership role in the bund in New York. He was elected general secretary in 1985 by an international congress of the bund.
        At his death, Mr. Litewka was on the Jewish Labor Committee's executive committee and was active in the Congress for Jewish Culture and the Workmen's Circle.
        Besides his son Albert, of Los Angeles, Mr. Litewka is survived by his wife, Chawa; another son, Jack, of Seattle, and a granddaughter.
