        John Howlett, the director of marketing and public relations for the Los Angeles Music Center Opera and the former vice president for promotion of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, died at his home in Los Angeles on Tuesday. He was 41 years old.
        He died of AIDS, said Marcia Lazar, a staff member of the marketing and public relations department at the Music Center.
        Mr. Howlett, who was born in New York City, studied at Christ the King Seminary and Fairfield University in Connecticut. He wrote dance criticism for The Albany Times Union before becoming a press representative. He was director of public relations for the New York Shakespeare Festival and in 1983 was appointed to his post at the Brooklyn Academy, where he remained until he moved to Los Angeles two years.
        His companion was Richard Atkins.
        He is survived by his parents, Frank and Cathleen Howlett, and two brothers, Frank and James, all of Stamford, Conn.
        A memorial service will be held on Oct. 5 at 10:30 A.M. in St. John's Church in Stamford.
