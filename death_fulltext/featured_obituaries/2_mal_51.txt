        William Lerner, the founder and president of Music Masters, a midtown Manhattan record store that has been a source of rare recordings for New York's music lovers, died of an immune system disorder Tuesday at St. Luke's Hospital. He was 62 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Lerner, whose enthusiasm for new composers never waned, opened Music Masters with a partner in 1948. He sold his interest in the shop in 1950 to become New York sales manager of Westminster Records. Three years later he became national sales manager of the Haydn Society.
        In 1956, he bought Music Masters from his former partner and moved the store to its present location at 25 West 43d Street, where it has been a gathering place for critics, singers, conductors, instrumentalists and record collectors.
        As an authority in his field, Mr. Lerner was frequently called on to appraise rare and valuable music collections, the Toscanini collection being one of those most recently assessed.
        Mr. Lerner also produced records for the Washington Square Company and the Offbeat Records Company, and recently had been producing disks for Box Office Records.
        He was born in Brooklyn and was a graduate of Brooklyn College, where he studied music.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Joan Monroe; a son, Andrew, and a daughter, Julie, both of Manhattan.
