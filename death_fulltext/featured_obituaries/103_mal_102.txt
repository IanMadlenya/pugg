        The Rev. Dr. Edwin H. Rian, whose ministry was mainly devoted to education, including 15 years as assistant to the president of Princeton Theological Seminary, died on Tuesday at the Pacific Region Health Care Center in San Diego. He was 95 and lived in San Diego.
        In a career that spanned more than half a century, he was president or vice president of six institutions.
        Dr. Rian was a leader of the fundamentalists who broke away from the main body at the Princeton seminary and formed the Westminster Theological Seminary in Philadelphia.
        He later served on the Westminster board, but left in 1946 to join the Christian University Association as general secretary. The next year he re-entered the Presbyterian Church of the U.S.A.
        Edwin Harold Rian was born in Minneapolis, graduated from Princeton University in 1927 and was ordained a Presbyterian minister at Princeton Theological Seminary in 1930. He then studied at the University of Berlin and the University of Marburg in Germany as a Princeton Fellow.
        After his stint at the Christian University Association, he held administrative posts at Trinity University in San Antonio, Beaver College in Jenkintown, Pa., Jamestown College in North Dakota and the Biblical Seminary in New York. He then worked at the American Bible Society and as an education consultant before becoming the secretary of James McCord, president of the Princeton seminary, in 1967.
        Dr. Rian's wife of 65 years, Marian Schall Rian, died a year ago. He is survived by three daughters, Roanne Pulliam of San Diego, Abigail R. Evans of Princeton and Marian Hays of Poway, Calif.; 10 grandchildren, and 3 great-grandchildren.
