        Irving Kissin, a real-estate lawyer for many years, died yesterday at New York Hospital. He was 62 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of liver and kidney failure, his daughter, Amanda Low, said.
        Mr. Kissin, a native New Yorker, graduated from New York University and N.Y.U. Law School. He was in private practice, representing building developers on the West Side of Manhattan. He retired in the late 1980's.
        Besides his daughter, a documentary producer for Fox Television in Manhattan, he is survived by a son, Carl, of Manhattan, a member of the Chicago City Limits, an improvisational comedy group; a sister, Betty Abromowitz of Cranbury, N.J., and a grandson.
