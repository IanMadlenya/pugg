        Mr. Barry moved to Tucson in 1973 after a 30-year career in chemical research with the Dow Corning Corporation in Michigan. He was director of chemical research for Dow from 1957 to 1971, when he retired.
        While at Dow he was one of seven scientists credited with the development of silicon products, the foundation of the computer and electronics industry. Mr. Barry, who specialized in the use of silicon for waterproofing, registered 66 patents.
        He later became an adjunct professor of chemistry at the University of Arizona.
        Mr. Barry received his bachelor's and doctoral degrees at Syracuse University, which awarded him the George Arents Pioneer Medal in 1973.
        He is survived by his wife, Marjorie; two daughters, Jane Anne Weissgerber of Delaware and Elizabeth Barry Poland of Berlin, West Germany; a son, Edwin A. Barry of San Rafael, Calif., and five grandchildren.
