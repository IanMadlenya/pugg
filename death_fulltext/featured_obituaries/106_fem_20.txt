        Edna Deane, the world champion ballroom dancer famous for being the girl "who's danced with the Prince of Wales," died on Wednesday at her home in Rottingdean, on the English Channel, The Times of London reported today. She was 90.
        Miss Deane was born Edna Morton Sewell in the Orange Free State, now part of  South Africa, in 1905 to British parents. In 1907, her family returned to England, where she trained in ballet and ballroom dancing.
        She became famous in Britain under the stage name Edna Deane in the 1920's.  At a ball in this period, Prince Edward, later King Edward VIII, was so entranced that he asked her to dance nine times.
        The incident inspired Herbert Farjeon, a playwright and songwriter, to pen the popular song "I've Danced With a Man, Who's Danced with a Girl, Who's Danced with the Prince of Wales."
        Fred Astaire, who saw her at the London Palladium in 1929, called her "authentic poetry in motion."
        In 1933, Miss Deane and her partner Timothy Palmer won the British and world  ballroom championships.
        After marrying in 1935, she retired as a professional dancer and became a choreographer and writer on dance. When she turned 90 last month, she was still  receiving birthday cards from fans.
        Miss Deane is survived by a daughter from her second marriage, to John Fuelling, a restaurateur, who is deceased.
