        James J. Mallen, who served as a borough director of parks in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island, died on Wednesday at his home in Paris. He was 87 years old and had lived in France since his retirement from the Parks Department more than 30 years ago.
        Mr. Mallen died after being stricken several weeks ago with acute leukemia, said his daughter, Pam DeFilippi of Lloyd Harbor, L.I.
        He served as director of parks in Brooklyn from 1954 to 1960, in Queens from 1939 to 1942 and on Staten Island from 1936 to 1939 and again from 1947 to 1954. He was the commander of the American Legion post in Paris from 1961 until the mid-1980's.
        Mr. Mallen's first wife, Margaret, died in 1954. He is survived by his second wife, Simone, and their son, Jean-Jacques, both of Paris, as well as by two grandchildren and a great-grandchild.
