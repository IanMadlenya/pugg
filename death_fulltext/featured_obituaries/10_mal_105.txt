        ''France has lost one of its most remarkable sons,'' President Francois Mitterrand said in a statement. He saluted Mr. Anquetil's ''immense sporting qualities.''
        Mr. Anquetil was the first cyclist to win the Tour de France five times, taking it in 1957 and from 1961 through 1964. The feat has been matched by Eddy Merckx of Belgium and Bernard Hinault of France.
