        Leon B. Poullada, a career Foreign Service officer who served as Ambassador to Togo during the Kennedy Administration and specialized in Afghan history, died of prostate cancer last Friday at his home in St. Paul, Minn. He was 74 years old. In his 17-year diplomatic career, Mr. Poullada, the son of a Mexican immigrant doctor, served in Ceylon, Pakistan and Afghanistan before President Kennedy named him Ambassador to the African coastal nation of Togo in 1961. In 1963, during Mr. Poullada's posting, Togo's President, Sylvanus Olympio, was shot and killed outside the United States Embassy gates.
        In 1965, after retiring from the Foreign Service, Mr. Poullada began studies at Princeton for a doctorate in political science. His dissertation, a study of Aghan history between 1919 and 1927, was published by Cornell University Press in 1972.
        Mr. Poullada taught political science at Northern Arizona University at Flagstaff and lectured around the country on Afghanistan and United States diplomacy. After Soviet troops swept into Afghanistan in 1979, he helped organize efforts to aid the Afghan guerrillas.
        He leaves his wife, Leila Jackson Poullada, two sons, Peter of Istanbul, Turkey, and Philip of Port Washington, N.Y., a daughter, Sophia Hafiza Safipour of Saratoga, Calif., and a grandchild. A memorial service will be held Aug. 8 in St. Paul.
