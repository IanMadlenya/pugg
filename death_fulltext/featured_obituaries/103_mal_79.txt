        Wilson D. McKerrow, a leader in social work who spent his career working to protect abused and neglected children, died on Aug. 10 in Chapel Hill, N.C. He was 89.
        Mr. McKerrow retired as executive director in 1972 after 32 years with the Brooklyn Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. During those years, he introduced innovative programs for the care, rehabilitation and schooling of troubled youths.
        In Chapel Hill, where he moved after retiring, he helped form one of North Carolina's first public departments on the aged, the Orange County Council on Aging, and served as its chairman from 1974 to 1983.
        He was born in Arcade, N.Y., and graduated from Harvard College in 1927. He worked with children's societies in upstate New York and as chief probation officer at Niagara County Children's Court and general secretary of the Family Welfare Society of Niagara Falls.
        In 1936, the New York School of Social Work recruited him for its teaching staff. But he preferred hands-on practice and joined the Brooklyn Society in 1940 as director of social case work. He became the chief executive a few years later, and among other things, oversaw the investigation of complaints of abuse and the assistance given the police in the prosecution of serious crimes against children.
        Mr. McKerrow is survived by his wife, Lucy Hobson McKerrow; a daughter, Gayle McK. Thompson of Algodones, N.M.; a son, Dr. James H., of San Francisco, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
