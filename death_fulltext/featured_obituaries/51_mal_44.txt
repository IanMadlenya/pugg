        Oscar Barrera, one of five brothers from Cuba who became well-known trainers of thoroughbred horses in the United States, died Thursday night at Jamaica Hospital in Queens. He was 63 years old.
        Mr. Barrera died several hours after suffering a heart attack at Aqueduct Race Track, said Dr. Emil Silberman, who treated him at the hospital. Mr. Barrera suffered the heart attack after saddling Loco Bleu, a horse he also owned, who ran fifth in the fourth race on Thursday.
        Oscar Barrera, whose career began on his grandfather's farm near Havana, was not as renowned as his older brother Lazaro, a Hall of Fame trainer who saddled the Triple Crown champion Affirmed in 1978. But Oscar nevertheless reigned as the most successful trainer on New York's race tracks for four consecutive years in the 1980's. He saddled 98 winners in 1983, then 148 the next year, 98 in 1985 and 112 in 1986.
        He was probably best known, though, for his remarkable talent at turning ordinary horses into instant winners. Shifty Sheik, a horse he claimed in 1984 for $35,000, won three allowance races in a row and ran second to Slew o' Gold in the prestigious Woodward Stakes.
        Mr. Barrera is survived by his wife, Zaida, and a son, Oscar Jr., in addition to his brothers.
