        Frank M. Campbell, a retired president of J.P. Duffy & Company a building-supply company in Long Island City, died on Wednesday at his home in Surfside, Fla. He was 75.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his son, John.
        During the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 Mr. Campbell was an ensign aboard the U.S.S. Arizona when it blew up, killing 1,100 of his shipmates. He left the Navy after World War II and in 1955 joined J.P. Duffy. He remained with the company until his retirement in 1970.
        He is survived by his wife, Judith, of Surfside; a daughter, Francine Coby of Greenwich, Conn.; two sons, John also of Greenwich and Craig, of Kalispell, Mont., and eight grandchildren.
