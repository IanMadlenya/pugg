        Robin Tate, an actor who appeared Off Broadway and in many regional productions, died on Aug. 19 at his home. He was 40 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was lung cancer, said his companion, Jason Buzas.
        At the time of his death, Mr. Tate was performing in "The Comedy of Errors" at the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival in Garrison, N.Y.
        For three years, he was a member of the resident acting company of the McCarter Theater in Princeton, N.J., where he acted in "Tartuffe" and "A Christmas Carol," among other productions. He also appeared at the Tyrone Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis and at the Berkshire Theater Festival in Stockbridge, Mass.
        His Off Broadway credits include the New York Shakespeare Festival production of "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg" and "Jacques and His Master" at the New Theater of Brooklyn.
        In addition to Mr. Buzas, he is survived by his parents, Anthony and Laura Tagliente of Sumner, Wash.; two sisters, Jeanne Wolf of Renton, Wash., and Phyllis Ciocca of Puyallop, Wash., and a brother, Thomas, of Hampton, Va.
