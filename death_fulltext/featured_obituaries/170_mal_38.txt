        Theodore Sachs, a Michigan constitutional lawyer and a legal adviser to organized labor, died on March 5 at a hospital in suburban Detroit. He was 72 and lived in West Bloomfield, Mich.
        The cause was a stroke, his family said.
        He was a former general counsel for the Michigan A.F.L.-C.I.O. as well as for the state Democratic Party. He helped shape labor-relations standards for the public and private sectors and argued cases before the United States Supreme Court, including one that affirmed the principle of one person, one vote for legislative apportionment in Michigan.
        He retired in 1996 as a senior partner and president of the Detroit firm  Sachs, Waldman, O'Hare, Helveston, Bogas & McIntosh, which he joined in 1951 after receiving his law degree from the University of Michigan.
        Mr. Sachs was born in Detroit and was a 1949 graduate of Wayne State University.
        He is survived by his wife of 50 years, Joan Abrams Sachs; a daughter, Andrea B. Sachs of Manhattan; a son, Jeffrey D., of Newton, Mass., the director of the Center for International Development at Harvard University; and three grandchildren.
