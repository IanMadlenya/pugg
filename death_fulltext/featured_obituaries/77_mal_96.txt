        Emil Lence, a one-time dress manufacturer who parlayed an unlikely investment in a skating rink into a career as a boxing promoter, died Wednesday at a nursing home in Delray Beach, Fla. He was 76.
        His family said the cause of death was complications from diabetes.
        Mr. Lence, a Brooklyn native who went into the family dress business, might have stayed there if he and his father, John, hadn't bought the Eastern Parkway Arena during World War II, operating it as a roller skating rink until 1947 when Jack Dempsey persuaded them to switch to boxing.
        For a decade the 5,000-seat Brooklyn arena was the low-profile alternative to Madison Square Garden, and its weekly shows spawned a generation of young fighters, including a 17-year-old prospect named Floyd Patterson.
        After Patterson succeeded Rocky Marciano as heavyweight champion in 1956, Mr. Lence promoted the new champion's first title defense, a 10th-round knockout of Tommy (Hurricane) Jackson, another Lence protege, at the Polo Grounds in 1957.
        Although the bout was a financial success, Mr. Lence soon drifted out of boxing and opened a chain of bowling alleys before becoming a mergers and acquisitions specialist on Wall Street.
        He is survived by his wife, Ann; a brother, Rudy; a sister, Terry Distler; two sons, George and Robert; a daughter, Jeanne Martin, and one grandson.
