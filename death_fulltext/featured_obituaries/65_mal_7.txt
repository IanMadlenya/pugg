        Franz Rupp, a pianist who was best known for his performances and recordings with the violinist Fritz Kreisler, the cellist Emanuel Feuermann and the contralto Marian Anderson, died last Wednesday at the Cabrini Hospice. He was 91 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of cancer of the esophagus, said his wife, Sylvia.
        Mr. Rupp was born in Schongau, Germany, on Feb. 24, 1901, and began his formal studies at the Akademie der Tonkunst in Munich when he was 14 years old. In 1920, he toured the United States with the violinist Willy Burmester. He made his name in the 1930's as an accompanist for the violinist Fritz Kreisler, with whom he recorded the complete Beethoven Violin Sonatas in 1935. Those recordings, recently reissued on compact disk, are still regarded as classic interpretations.
        By the time he settled in New York City in 1938, he was already well known as an accompanist, and he quickly became an important part of the city's musical fabric. Other instrumentalists with whom he worked included the cellist Zara Nelsova and the violinists Erica Morini and George Kulenkampff. He continued working into the 1980's and made his last recordings with Kakaya Urakawa, a Japanese violinist. His last public performance was a concert of Kreisler pieces with the violist Rivka Golani at the Lockenhaus festival in Austria in 1985.
        Mr. Rupp's longest-standing collaboration, however, was with Miss Anderson, with whom he began working in the 1940's. He worked as her regular accompanist until she retired from the concert stage in 1965.
        In the 1970's, he taught the German vocal literature and chamber music at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia.
        He is survived by his wife.
