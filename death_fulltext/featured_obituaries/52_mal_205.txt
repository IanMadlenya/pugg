        Manning Clark, whose six-volume "History of Australia" was the first comprehensive history of the continent, died on Thursday. He was 76 years old.
        A family spokesman said Mr. Clark died at his Canberra home after a short illness but gave no other details.
        Mr. Clark's history was researched and published between 1962 and 1987. He retired in 1975 after teaching history for 27 years at the Australian National University.
        Mr. Clark also published collections of documents on Australian history, including an appreciation of the life of the Australian poet and humorist Henry Lawson.
