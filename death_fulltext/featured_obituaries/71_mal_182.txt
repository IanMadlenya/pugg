        Mr. Churchill began playing competitive bridge in 1928, soon after he graduated from Harvard Law School. He contributed to the theory of the game, and in his book, "Contract Bidding Tactics at Match-Point Play," published in 1937, he expounded on concepts like "the balance of power," "the weak no-trump" and "picture bidding." A later book, "Churchill Natural Bidding Style at Contract Bridge," was published in 1979.
        He won the Life Master's Pair Championship in 1937 and again in 1948.
        He was born in Bellefontaine, Ohio. Most of his legal career was spent with the firm of Loeb, Churchill & Lawther in Manhattan.
        His wife, Mary Ellen Peck Churchill, died in 1973.
        He is survived by a son, James Garton of Woodstock, Vt.; a daughter, Barbara Churchill Thompson of Old Greenwich, Conn.; six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.
