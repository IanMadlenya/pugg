        Rudi Baumfeld, an architect who designed the first two-level enclosed shopping mall built in the United States, Southdale in Minneapolis, died of congestive heart failure on Feb. 20 in Los Angeles. He was 84 years old.
        Mr. Baumfeld came to the United States from his native Austria in 1940 after designing buildings in several European countries. He joined with Victor Gruen, the architect and planner, in 1943 and was an original partner in Victor Gruen Associates when it was formed in 1951. He headed several departments of the firm, inluding design, interior design, graphics, merchandising and store layout.
        Many of his projects were in the Los Angeles area where he lived, among them the South Coast Plaza and Costa Mesa centers, the Wilshire Terrace apartments and the Tishman 615 Building, whose 22 stories made it the first erected over the long-existing 13-story Los Angeles height limit. He designed more than a dozen Joseph Magnin stores in Western states.
        After his retirement from Gruen Associates in 1968 he continued as a consultant to the firm until his death.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Marianne Perles.
