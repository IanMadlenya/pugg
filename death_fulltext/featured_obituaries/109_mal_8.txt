        Mikhail Reshetnyov, who designed Soviet booster rockets and satellites, died  on Friday. He was 71.
        Mr. Reshetnyov died at Krasnoyarsk-26, a closed nuclear research center in eastern Siberia that also housed his space design bureau.
        He joined the team of Sergei Korolyov, a pioneer Soviet space designer, in the early 1950's and eventually became Mr. Korolyov's deputy. In 1959 he was put in charge of a design bureau at Krasnoyarsk-26.
        He designed the Kosmos booster rocket, a workhorse of the Soviet space program, and more than 30 kinds of communication and spy satellites.
