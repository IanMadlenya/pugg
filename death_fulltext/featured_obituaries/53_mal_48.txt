        The Rev. John L. Thomas, a Jesuit sociologist, author and former writer in residence at Marquette University in Milwaukee, died Tuesday at St. Camillus Health Center in Milwaukee. He was 81 years old.
        Father Thomas died of cancer, a spokesman for the university said.
        His primary concern was the well-being of the family as the basic unity of society, and he wrote and lectured widely on that subject.
        Father Thomas became associated with Marquette in 1986 and continued his writings until 1988, when he became too ill to work.
        In 1942 he joined the faculty of St. Louis University as a professor of sociology. That year he and other members of the Society of Jesus began the Jesuit Institute of Social Order, a national research institute in the social sciences. The institute moved to the Cambridge Center for Social Studies in Cambridge, Mass., in 1965, and relocated to Georgetown University in Washington in 1971. He remained until 1986, when he retired from teaching.
        Father Thomas wrote several books, among them "Alternative America" (Harvard University Press; 1983), a study of the adversary tradition and three 19th-century writers and reformers, Henry George, Edward Bellamy and Henry Demarest Lloyd; "The Family Clinic: A Book of Questions and Answers" (Newman Press; 1959) and "The American Catholic Family" (Prentice Hall; 1956).
        He was born on a farm in Berlin, Wis., and joined the priesthood in Florissant, Mo., in 1939. He was a graduate of St. Louis University and received master's degrees in English and French literature from the University of Montreal. While studying with Canadian Jesuits in Montreal he became interested in sociology, and received a Ph.D. in sociology in 1949 from the University of Chicago.
        He is survived by three sisters, Genevieve Lorenz of Appleton, Wis., Helen Thomas of Berlin, Wis., and Anabelle Buckeley of Mesa, Ariz.
