        Edward C. Anderberg, the retired president and chief administrative officer of Green Point Savings Bank, died Thursday at North Shore University Hospital in Glen Cove, L.I. He was 76 years old and lived in Laurel Hollow, L.I.
        He died of cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Anderberg started at the bank in 1935 as a ticket clerk sorting deposit slips at the branch in Flatbush, Brooklyn. Attending night classes in finance and accounting, he earned bachelor's and master's degrees from New York University.
        Rising through the ranks, he was appointed a trustee in 1974 and eventually was promoted to president and chief administrative officer in 1982. He retired from full-time service in 1986 but continued on the board until his death. He held several posts in the New York State Savings Banks Association.
        The bank grew greatly during his 53 years there, expanding into Queens, Long Island and Westchester, and now has assets of nearly $6 billion.
        The only break in his banking career was during World War II, when he served four years in the Army, stationed at the Pentagon and in Hawaii.
        He was born in Queens and grew up in Brooklyn.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Carol Kirkwood; three sons, Thomas, of Los Angeles, Robert, of Brooklyn and High Falls, N.Y., Steven, of Laurel Hollow, L.I.; a daughter, Karen, of Boston, and four grandchildren.
