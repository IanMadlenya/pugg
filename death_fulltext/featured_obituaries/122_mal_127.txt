        Martin Atlas, a retired tax lawyer, real estate executive and former president of the Cafritz Foundation, a leading benefactor of the arts, education and social programs in Washington, died on Tuesday at his home in Washington. He was 82.
        The cause was lymphoma, his family said.
        Mr. Atlas came to prominence in the Cafritz Company, one of the largest real estate companies in the Washington area, and the Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation. The foundation, established in 1948, recently reported assets of $162 million and annual disbursements of more than $10 million to recipients that included literacy and AIDS programs, the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, the Kennedy Center and the Planned Parenthood Association.
        Mr. Atlas, a native of New York City, graduated from New York University and the George Washington University Law School. He became an authority on tax laws.
        He joined the Cafritz Company in 1948 as a tax lawyer, rose to executive vice president and retired as president in 1989. He became the chief architect of the foundation set up by Mr. and Mrs. Cafritz, building it into an important source of support for many community services and the arts in the District of Columbia. He retired as foundation president in 1993 but remained a director until last year.
        Survivors include his wife of 53 years, Liane; two sons, Terry, of Washington, and Jeff, of San Francisco, and two grandchildren.
