        Wallace Potts, film archivist for the Rudolf Nureyev Foundation, died on June 29 in Los Angeles. He was 59.
        The cause was complications of lymphoma, said Sir John Tooley, chairman of the foundation.
        Mr. Potts assembled a comprehensive collection of every known appearance by Nureyev on film and video, building on a library that the dancer had compiled for himself. The foundation collection includes performance and interview film and videos from sources around the world and Mr. Potts' own 16-millimeter films of Nureyev performing.
        Mr. Potts also played an important role in arranging for the archive to be housed at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center, as well as at the Centre Nationale de la Danse in France.
        Mr. Potts served as first assistant director on the 1972 film of the ballet ''Don Quixote,'' directed by Nureyev and Robert Helpmann. He also worked in various production capacities with the directors Pier Paolo Pasolini, Mike Nichols and James Bridges and made several films of his own, including the 1988 horror film, ''Psycho Cop,'' which he wrote and directed.
        Mr. Potts is survived by a brother, Tommy, of Montgomery, Ala.
