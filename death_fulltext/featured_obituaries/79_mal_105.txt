        Dr. Julius Wishner, emeritus professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, died on Sunday at Bryn Mawr Hospital. He was 72.
        Professor Wishner, who lived in Haverford, Pa., had been ill for a long time, the university said.
        Dr. Wishner was a specialist in psychopathology and schizophrenia, and his most recent research sought to show that the root disorder in schizophrenia can be traced to faults in the way the schizophrenic mind processes information.
        He interrupted his education at Brooklyn College to serve in World War II as a navigator and first lieutenant in the Army Air Forces, where he won the Distinguished Flying Cross. After the war he graduated from Brooklyn College, and received a Ph.D. from Northwestern University in 1950.
        He joined the Penn faculty as an instructor in 1949 and became a full professor in 1963. From 1974 to 1980, Dr. Wishner was a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School. He retired from the psychology department two years ago.
        Dr. Wishner served as president of the faculty senate at Penn from 1965 to 1967, when there were protests over reports that secret projects involving the Vietnam War were being conducted on the campus. He was credited with guiding the university toward a policy that calmed the protests by barring secret research on the campus.
        He is survived by his wife of 52 years, the former Dorothy Busker; two daughters, Amy Wishner of Philadelphia and Prof. Karen Wishner of Narragansett, R.I., and a grandson.
