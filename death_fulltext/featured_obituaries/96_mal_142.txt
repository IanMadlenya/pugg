        Philip Burton, a stage director and actor and the foster father of Richard Burton, died on Saturday at the William Crane Gray Inn nursing home in Davenport, Fla. He was 90.
        He had had a severe stroke a few days earlier, a spokesman for the home said.
        It was in the late 1930's, when he was teaching Shakespeare at a school in Wales, that Philip Burton discovered the talent of a pupil, Richard Jenkins. In 1943, he informally adopted the youth (they were not far enough apart in age for a legal adoption) and helped him get his first acting role in London. Richard, then 18, changed his last name to Burton.
        In a 1989 interview, the director Tony Palmer, who had just completed a documentary on Richard Burton, said of Philip Burton, "No praise can be too high for what he managed to do with this rather strange lad."
        And Richard Burton, who died in 1984, once said of the man he called his father, "Everything I've learned about the theater, I've learned from Philip."
        Born in Wales in 1904, the elder Burton graduated from the University of Wales and spent his early adult years teaching and freelancing as a writer for the British Broadcasting Corporation.
        The Burtons found acclaim simultaneously in the postwar era, Philip as a stage director and actor. He was also a writer, teacher and director for the BBC. He moved to New York City in the mid-1950's, and made his New York debut in 1958 in Sean O'Casey's "Purple Dust" and "Cock-a-Doodle Dandy." In the 60's, he served as director of the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in New York, and taught Shakespeare there. He became a United States citizen in 1964.
        He retired to Key West, Fla., in the early 1970's after suffering a heart attack.
