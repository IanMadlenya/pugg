        In 1932 Mr. Woodley founded Woodley Airways, which offered passenger service between Anchorage and Nome. It was a one-plane, one-pilot operation, but quickly caught on as an alternative to the monthlong trek by dogsled. It was also cheaper. Mr. Woodley charged passengers $150; the dogsled trip cost $750.
        He extended credit to his passengers until the end of each trapping season. In 1935 he estimated that he was owed $300,000, but all of it was eventually paid.
        After World War II Mr. Woodley changed the name of his airline, which grew to serve all of Alaska, to Pacific Northern Airlines. He sold it to Western Airlines in 1967 and became a vice president of Western until he retired in 1971.
        Mr. Woodley is survived by his wife, Miriam, three sons and six grandchildren.
