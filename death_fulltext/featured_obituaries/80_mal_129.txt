        John F. Carroll, a leader of Irish-American organizations, died on Saturday. He was 67 and lived in Brooklyn.
        Mr. Carroll, who moved from Ireland in 1949, served as president of the United Irish Counties and the Galway Association and was a trustee of the Irish Institute and the Ancient Order of Hibernians.
        For two decades he was chairman of the annual United Irish Counties Feis, which is the largest Irish cultural event in North America, and he was a vice chairman of the annual St. Patrick's Day Parade.
        Mr. Carroll was also a politically active Democrat who served as a liaison for former Mayor Edward I. Koch to New York City's Irish community.
        In recent years, he worked with Representative Charles Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, a sponsor of immigration-reform legislation to eliminate discrimination against prospective Irish immigrants.
        Mr. Carroll worked for the New York City Board of Education as a school custodian for 25 years.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary; five children, and 13 grandchildren.
