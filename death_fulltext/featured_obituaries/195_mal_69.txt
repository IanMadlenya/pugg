        Dr. John Francis Kullberg, president of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals from 1978 to 1991, died on Sunday in Rockville, Md. He was 64 and lived in Germantown, Md.
        The cause was cancer, the Humane Society of the United States said in announcing his death.
        When he died, he had been an executive of the society for a decade and the first executive director of its Wildlife Land Trust.
        He was a veteran administrator of nonprofit organizations, with jobs ranging from director of admissions and assistant dean at Columbia University's law school to chairman of the board of the National Coalition to Protect Our Pets.
        A native of Cranston, R.I., Dr. Kullberg received bachelor's and master's degrees from Catholic University of America and the University of Rhode Island and a doctorate in education from Teachers College at Columbia.
        He is survived by his wife, Karol; two daughters, Kathryn and Kristen; a son, Evan; a sister, Marjorie Cooke; and a brother, Warren.
