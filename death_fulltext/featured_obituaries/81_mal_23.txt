        George H. Kaplan, a retired Manhattan lawyer and former arbitrator for the New York dress industry, died on Monday at his home in Teaneck, N.J. He was 81.
        He died of a heart attack a day after the death of his wife of 52 years, the former Marjorie Smith, said his daughter, Helaine Kaplan Prentice.
        Mr. Kaplan, a native of Paterson, N.J., graduated from New York University and Harvard Law School. In 1946 he became a founding partner in the firm of Silver, Bernstein, Seawell & Kaplan. It closed in 1973 when he was named impartial chairman for the dress industry.
        In that post, he served both the International Ladies Garment Workers Union and five trade associations, hearing disputes twice weekly and keeping a hectic pace as the garment center's chief fact-finder and mediator.
        "I have had about 8,000 cases involving the issue of holiday pay since 1976 alone," he said when he resigned in 1980 at the age of 68, "and from 350 to 450 cases each year on other issues." Since then he had kept up a more limited private law practice.
        He was a past president and board member of the Teaneck Jewish Center. In the 1960's and 70's he was honored by the Israel Bond Campaign in Teaneck and New York City.
        During World War II he served as a sergeant in the Army.
        In addition to his daughter, a resident of Berkeley, Calif., Mr. Kaplan is survived by a sister, Bette Menkes of Teaneck, and two grandchildren.
