        Ranjabati Sircar, a dancer and choreographer who fused India's classical and folk dance traditions with experimental forms from the West, died in Bombay on Oct. 23. She was 36 and lived in Calcutta.
        The cause was unknown, said Jonathan Hollander, a friend and the artistic director of the Battery Dance Company in New York.
        Ms. Sircar was the daughter of Manjusri Chaki-Sircar, one of India's best-known dancers. Together they established a school in Calcutta, Dancers' Guild, that focused on what they called navanritya, a contemporary form of Indian dance with its own technique and training system.
        Ms. Sircar was born in Nigeria and grew up in the United States. She graduated from Jadavpur University in Calcutta and trained in classical and folk dance in India. She sought, however, a creative synthesis of modern dance from the West with classical Indian traditions.
        In 1990 she participated in the International Choreographers Workshop of the American Dance Festival in Durham, N.C., and in 1992 she founded the South Asian Dance Youth Company, which won her the London Dance and Performance Award. Ms. Sircar wrote ''Navanritya: Toward Contemporary Indian Dance.'' She is survived by her mother, of Calcutta.
