        George Schermer, a former human rights official and an expert on race relations, died of congestive heart failure Saturday at his home in Washington. He was 78 years old.
        Mr. Schermer was often called upon by cities around the country to help deal with racial tensions. He began his career with the Chicago Housing Authority as supervisor of tenant selection in 1938. He later became a housing official in Detroit and from 1945 to 1952 headed the Mayor's Interracial Committee, which was formed after race riots there.
        In 1953 he became the executive director of the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations. He quit in 1963, accusing Mayor James H. J. Tate of making the commission too weak to cope with racial issues.
        Mr. Schermer moved to Washington in 1965 and for 20 years had his own consulting firm, dealing with urban social problems. His clients included the Ford Foundation and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, for which he conducted a study measuring discrimination in housing in 40 cities across the nation.
        He is survived by his wife, Bernice; two sons, Philip, of Kirkland, Wash., and Vernon, of Seattle; two daughters, Judith and Wendy, both of Philadelphia; a brother, Eugene, of Farmington Hills, Mich.; two sisters, Elsie Hopkins, of Park Ridge, Ill., and Viola Price, of Carlsbad, Calif., and eight grandchildren.
