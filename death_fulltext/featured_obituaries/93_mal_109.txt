        Martin W. Frey, retired superintendent of Community School District 4, in East Harlem, died on Thursday at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. He was 73 and moved recently from Rye, N.Y., to Larchmont, N.Y.
        The cause of death was leukemia, said his daughter, Amy Kashchy.
        Mr. Frey was instrumental in the creation, in 1969, of El Museo del Barrio, the city's first museum of Hispanic culture, now at Fifth Avenue and 104th Street. After retiring from the city school system, he was an administrator at Bronx Community College. He was also active in Rye community affairs.
        Before Mr. Frey became superintendent of District 4, he spent two sometimes turbulent decades as a teacher and administrator in the former Local School District 4, which covered Morningside Heights and Harlem as well as East Harlem.
        A native of the Bronx, he earned a B.A. from New York University, served in the Navy in World War II and earned master's degrees in history and education from N.Y.U.
        Besides his daughter, of Rye, he is survived by his wife, Elaine; a son, Adam, of Manhattan; two grandchildren, and a sister, Gilda Landset of Nanuet, N.Y.
