        Samuel A. Turvey, a retired Staten Island banker who was active in local civic organizations, died on Monday at Carmel Richmond Nursing Home in Dongan Hills, S.I. He was 91 years old and lived in Grymes Hill, S.I.
        He died of a stroke, a family spokesman said.
        Mr. Turvey was president of the New Brighton-Staten Island Savings and Loan Association for 27 years before its merger in 1971 with a bank that eventually was renamed First Nationwide. He continued as an executive vice president until 1974, when he retired.
        A graduate of the Banking Institute in Manhattan, he was also active in real estate and insurance and held positions in many community organizations, including the borough's Visiting Nurse Association, the American Red Cross chapter. He was chairman of the advisory board of St. Vincent's Medical Center in Staten Island.
        He is survived by his wife, Alice; two sons, John, of Shore Acres, S.I., and Dr. Timothy of Chapel Hill, N.C.; four daughters, Jean Flynn of Port St. Richie, Fla., Mary Alice White of Center Valley, Pa., Patricia Dellomo of Old Brookville, L.I., and Kathryn Cronin of Hillsdale, N.J.; 24 grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren.
