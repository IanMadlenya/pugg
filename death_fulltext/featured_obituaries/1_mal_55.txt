        Federal District Judge Gus J. Solomon, who championed the cause of civil rights in a 58-year career, died Sunday of complications resulting from cancer. He was 80 years old.
        Judge Solomon joined the Federal bench in 1949 and was named Chief Judge of the Federal District Court here 10 years later. He retired to senior status in 1971 but continued to hear cases regularly.
        Among Judge Solomon's rulings as a Federal judge was his decision in 1972 that the Portland Elks Lodge could not receive state tax exemptions because the fraternal organization restricted its membership to whites.
        He ruled in 1975 that the State of Oregon discriminated against women by using different life expectancy tables to determine benefits for state retirees.
        In 1936 Mr. Solomon represented a man before the Supreme Court who had been imprisoned for speaking at a public meeting sponsored by the Communist Party at a period of labor strife on the Portland docks.
        The Court found that his client could not be prosecuted for speaking at a public meeting at which no laws had been broken or at which no one was incited to break the law.
        In the 1940's, Judge Solomon publicly opposed the internment of Japanese-Americans in World War II.
        Judge Solomon is survived by his wife, Elisabeth; three sons, Gerald and Richard of Portland and Phillip of Los Angeles; a sister, Claire Cantor of Portland, and three grandchildren.
