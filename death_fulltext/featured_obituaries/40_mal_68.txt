        Leon M. Prince, a research chemist who specialized in microemulsions, the study of the chemical reaction of oil and water, died of heart failure on Saturday at his home in Larchmont, N.Y. He was 79 years old and had been a longtime resident of Westfield, N.J., until 1985.
        Mr. Prince, a native of Manhattan and a graduate of Columbia University, worked on the Manhattan Project in World War II with a team of chemists that separated the elements of uranium for the atomic bomb.
        He was a researcher for Lever Brothers in Edgewater, N.J., until his retirement in 1975. He wrote two books, ''Biological Horizons in Surface Science'' and ''Microemulsions: Theory and Practice.''
        Mr. Prince's wife, the former Adelaide Wald, died in 1985. He is survived by two daughters, Judy Delehanty and Dr. Alice Prince, both of Larchmont, and five grandsons.
