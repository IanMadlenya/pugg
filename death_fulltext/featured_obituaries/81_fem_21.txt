        Joan Sibley, a fashion designer whose work is included in the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, died on Tuesday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset. She was 52.
        The cause was Burkitt's lymphoma, a rare form of cancer, said her husband, Peter Powell.
        Ms. Sibley started her career in a small design studio she established on East 58th Street in Manhattan. She founded Sibley Coffee Ltd. with a fellow designer, Dory Coffee, in 1966. The company's popular silk jersey body dresses were sold in stores like Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus, and private customers included Jacqueline Onassis, Babe Paley and Candice Bergen.
        Born in Gipsy, Pa., she attended the Moore College of Art in Philadelphia and received a fellowship to travel and study in Europe, where she attended design classes at the Sorbonne.
        Sibley Coffee was made a part of the Bendel's Studio Group in 1973 and closed in 1977. Ms. Sibley went on to work as associate designer for Ellen Tracy until 1980, when she left to work as a display designer and sales representative for Yale Burg, an antiques importing company in Manhattan.
        She is survived by her husband and a son, Gus Powell, who attends Oberlin College in Ohio.
