        Jean Paris, a former vice president and director of design for Cartier Inc. of New York, died on Thursday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 62 years old.
        Mr. Paris, who lived and had a studio in Manhattan, died after a long struggle with colon cancer, said Dorinda Scharff Hawkins, a spokeswoman for the jewelry company.
        A native of France, Mr. Paris was a graduate of the Arts Appliques a l'Industrie technical college in Paris. He began his career with Cartier in Paris in 1946. ''When I first started at Cartier, I had to sweep the workroom floor,'' Mr. Paris once told an interviewer. ''After four years of school you begin thinking you're a genius, and then they hand you a broom.''
        Mr. Paris remained with Cartier until 1953, then began designing jewelry for Van Cleef & Arpels and later for Trifari. Then in 1969, he joined Cartier in New York as vice president and director of design.
        During his career, Mr. Paris completed commissions to design jewelry for the Duchess of Windsor, Elizabeth Taylor and Barbara Hutton, among others. In recent years, while working privately, he created designs for the Franklin Mint.
        Mr. Paris is survived by his mother, Marie Louise, and two brothers, Pierre and Bernard, all of Paris.
