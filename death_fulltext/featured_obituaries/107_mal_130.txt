        Bernard Yoh, a lecturer on psychological warfare and former underground fighter in China and Vietnam, died on Monday at a nursing home in Bethesda, Md.  He was 74 and lived in Rockville, Md.
        He suffered a stroke, according to Accuracy in Media, a conservative media watchdog organization of which he was director of communications.
        Mr. Yoh was born in Shanghai and educated in Jesuit schools. During World War II, he joined the underground to fight the Japanese occupiers of his homeland. His group later became part of a United States Navy Sino-American Cooperative Organization, which rescued American airmen downed on missions over  Japanese-held territory.
        Mr. Yoh first arrived in the United States in 1947. In the late 1950's, he was an adviser to President Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam and helped form and equip a counterinsurgency force, the Sea Swallows, operating behind Vietcong lines.
        Returning to the United States in 1963, he settled in the Washington area and commuted to Montgomery, Ala., to lecture on counterinsurgency and psychological  warfare at the Air War College. He joined Accuracy in Media in 1974..
        Mr. Yoh is survived by his wife, Joan Thompson Yoh; their daughter, Yolanda Yoh, also of Rockville; two sons and two daughters from an earlier marriage, Anthony and Ann Yoh, both of Majorca, Spain, Augustine, of New York City, and Cecelia Yoh Dorhra of Elmhurst, Ill.; 10 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
