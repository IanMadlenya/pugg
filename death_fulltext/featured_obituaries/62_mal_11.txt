        Dr. Albert S. Keston, inventor of a diagnostic test used by diabetics to determine urine sugar levels, died last Wednesday while working in his laboratory at New York University. He was 80 years old and lived in New York City.
        Dr. Keston died of a heart attack, said his wife, Katharine.
        He invented Tes-Tape, a glucose-sensitive tape that for years was the standard device for determining levels of sugar in the urine. The inexpensive and simple test also led to the detection of millions of previously unrecognized cases of diabetes. Dr. Keston developed numerous other diagnostic tools for research and clinical applications.
        Dr. Keston was born in New York City. He received bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Michigan and a doctorate from Yale University. He taught chemistry at City College of New York, then became a professor at New York University College of Medicine. He later served as a professor and eventually professor emeritus at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Last spring Dr. Keston returned to New York University to continue his research.
        With the earnings from the patents of his inventions, Dr. Keston founded a private research institution, the Institute for Medical Research and Studies in New York City.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by his son, Robert, of La Canada, Calif., and two daughters, Carol Waterman of McKownville, N.Y., and Suzanne Keston of Boulder, Colo.
