        Julian Orbon, a Spanish-born Cuban composer, died on Monday at Sinai Medical Center in Miami. He was 65 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of cancer, his family said.
        The composer Aaron Copland, with whom Mr. Orbon studied at the Berkshire Music Center at Tanglewood, once described him as "Cuba's most gifted composer of the new generation."
        But Mr. Orbon was not recognized by Cuba's musical establishment after he left the country permanently in 1960, said Velia Yedra, a Cuban-American pianist who wrote about him in a recently published book, "Julian Orbon: A Biographical and Critical Essay."
        Mr. Orbon's works range from pieces for orchestra to vocal, chamber and keyboard music, and the influences on his compositions include the composer Manuel de Falla, folk music of Spain, Cuba and Latin America, Gregorian chant and African music.
        Mr. Orbon, born in Aviles, Spain, was the son of Benjamin Orbon, a pianist, teacher and composer who was a co-founder of the Orbon Conservatory in Havana. The younger Mr. Orbon started piano lessons there with his father in 1932.
        The family settled in Cuba in 1940 and Mr. Orbon studied harmony and counterpoint with Jose Ardevol, joining him as a co-founder of a Cuban school of composers, Grupo de Renovacion Musical.
        He also wrote criticism and played the piano at concerts of contemporary Cuban music. After his father's death in 1944, he took over as director of the conservatory. The next year he won a scholarship to study with Mr. Copland at Tanglewood.
        In 1960, he left Cuba to teach composition at the National Conservatory in Mexico City and decided not to return home because he had become disenchanted with Cuban politics, Ms. Yedra writes. In 1963 he settled in New York.
        Surviving are his wife, Mercedes; two sons, Andres of Manhattan and Julianof Peekskill, N.Y.; a sister, Ana Abril, of Oviedo, Spain, and two grandchildren.
