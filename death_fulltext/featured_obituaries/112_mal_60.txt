        Richard M. Kaplan, a leader in the Manhattan fashion industry, died on May 3  in Manhattan. He was 60 and lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.

        In 1991, he founded and was chairman of the Worth Collection Ltd., a company  that designs, manufactures and sells women's luxury clothing.
        He was a director and past president of the Educational Foundation for the Fashion Industries and was cited by the Fashion Institute of Technology for his  service to the school. He was active in the fashion industry's chapter of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies and was on the boards of the Horace Mann School, Congregation B'nai Jeshurun, the Y.M.-Y.W.H.A.'s of New York and the Yale Alumni Fund.
