        John Blassingame, a scholar of the history of slavery in America and a former chairman of the African-American Studies program at Yale University, died on Feb. 13 at his home in New Haven. He was 59.
        The cause of death was not known, said his son, John W. Blassingame Jr. of New Haven.
        Mr. Blassingame joined the Yale faculty in 1970 and became a professor in 1974. Three early books helped solidify his academic reputation: ''New Perspectives on Black Studies'' (University of Illinois Press, 1971); 'The Slave Community: Plantation Life in the Antebellum South'' (Oxford University Press, 1972); and ''Black New Orleans, 1860-1880'' (University of Chicago Press, 1973.)
        Mr. Blassingame also became editor of the papers of Frederick Douglass in the mid-70's and published six volumes of Douglass's papers and manuscripts from 1979 to 1999.
        He pioneered the recovery of voluminous autobiographical materials by former slaves, which he collected in ''Slave Testimony: Two Centuries of Letters, Speeches, Interviews and Autobiographies,'' published by Louisiana State University Press in 1977.
        He was an early member of Yale's African-American Studies Program, for which he served as acting chairman from 1971 to 1972 and from 1976 to 1977 and then as chairman from 1981 to 1989. He was also affiliated with the university's history department and its American studies program.
        Mr. Blassingame was born in Covington, Ga., on March 23, 1940. He received a bachelor's degree at Fort Valley State College, a master's degree at Howard University, and a doctorate at Yale.
        In addition to his son Mr. Blassingame is survived by his wife, Teasie; a daughter, Tia, of New Haven; his father, Grady Blassingame of Atlanta, and a sister, Alberta Hardges of Social Circle, Ga.
