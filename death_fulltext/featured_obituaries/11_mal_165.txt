        Newsweek magazine featured Mr. Fuller and his brother, John W. Fuller, in a recent cover article on twins. In 1924 the two became the first twin Eagle Scouts. They held every rank in scouting. They also organized the first Scout troop for the retarded and the first Explorer post for the retarded in New England. Both worked at Northeast Airlines for 25 years and retired together.
