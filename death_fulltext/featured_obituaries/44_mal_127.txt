        Dr. DeWire, who retired as professor of physics and nuclear studies at Cornell in 1986, was associate director of the university's Laboratory of Nuclear Studies from 1968 to 1974. In 1983 he became the university ombudsman, a post he continued to hold after retirement until two years ago.
        Dr. DeWire, who was a native of Milton, Pa., was a graduate of Ursinus College and held a doctorate in physics from Ohio State University. He worked in experimental nuclear physics at Princeton and on the physics of uranium fission at the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico during World War II, participating in the first atomic test explosion at Alamogordo, N.M.
        He joined Cornell in 1946 and rose to a full professorship in 1958. He played an important role in developing electron accelerators and was head of the main accelerator group at the Fermi National Laboratory in 1967.
        Dr. DeWire was a Fellow of the American Physical Society and a trustee of Associated Universities Inc., which operates the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Ruth Hale; a daughter, Susan Hosek of Los Angeles; a son, William, of Lewistown, Pa., and five grandchildren.
