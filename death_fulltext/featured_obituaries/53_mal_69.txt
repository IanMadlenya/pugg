        The Rev. Vincent Peter Miceli, an educator, author and a former member of the Jesuits, died on Sunday at Good Samaritan Hospital in West Islip, L.I. He was 75 years old and lived in Front Royal, Va.
        He died of cancer, said a friend, Roger McCaffrey.
        Father Miceli, who earned his doctorate from Fordham University, entered the Society of Jesus in 1936 and was ordained a priest in 1949. He taught philosophy at several colleges and universities, including Loyola University, St. John's University and most recently at Christendom College in Front Royal, Va.
        He was also the co-host of a syndicated radio program, "Where Catholics Meet," which was broadcast for the last nine years on WOR radio. He was the author of several books, including "The Roots of Violence," "The Antichrist," and "Women Priests and Other Fantasies," all published by Christopher Publishing House. Some of his writings raised concerns among his superiors in the Jesuits and he left the order in 1982. He then became associated with the Diocese of Ponce, P.R.
        He is survived by two sisters, Marie Selvaggio of the Bronx, and Mother Ignatius Miceli, a member of the Mother Cabrini order in Denver.
