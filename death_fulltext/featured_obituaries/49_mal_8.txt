        William Cary Matthews, an advertising executive and a former vice president of Foote, Cone and Belding in San Francisco, died Tuesday at his home in San Francisco. He was 70 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, said his wife, the former Joan Kimball.

        He was a director of the San Francisco Art Institute, the San Francisco Opera Association, the San Francisco Zoological Society and the American Cancer Society.
        In addition to his wife he is survived by two sons, William Jr. of Denver and Peter of Manhattan; two daughters, Kim Wheaton of Oakland, Calif., and Cary Nowell of Ross, Calif.; a brother, Richard of Nantucket; and seven grandchildren.
