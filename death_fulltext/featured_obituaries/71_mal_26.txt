        Theodore D. Woolsey, a former director of the National Center of Health Statistics, died Nov. 27 while attending a family reunion in Dorset, Vt. He was 79 years old and lived in Bethesda, Md.
        Sandy Smith, a spokeswoman for the Center, reported his death yesterday and said the cause was a heart attack.
        Mr. Woolsey was director of the center, the Federal Government's prinicipal health statistics agency, from 1967 to 1973.
        An expert on vital statistics, he began his Government career in 1937 at the Census Bureau after graduating from Yale University in 1936.
        His 23-year career at the Census Bureau and the Public Health Service was interrupted for wartime service in the Army.
        He helped to write the National Health Survey Act of 1956, and, when the National Center was created in 1960, he became its director for national health surveys. Mr. Woolsey was also the agency's deputy director before becoming its head.
        Mr. Woolsey retired in 1973 and became a consultant on health statistics to several Federal agencies and public and private institutions.
        In 1973 the Federal Department of Health, Education and Welfare awarded him its Distinguished Service Award.
        Mr. Woolsey is survived by his wife, Adele; two sons, George M., of Homewood, Ill., and Dr. Timothy D., of Austin, Tex.; a daughter, Abigail W. Rowley of Swarthmore, Pa.; four grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
