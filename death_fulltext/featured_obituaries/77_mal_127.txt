        Charles Mikolaycak, an illustrator of children's books and a book designer, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 56.
        His wife, Carole Kismaric, said the cause was cancer.
        In his 30-year career, Mr. Mikolaycak illustrated more than 60 books for children and hundreds of book jackets. His illustrations, often inspired by his Polish and Ukrainian heritage, were widely acclaimed for their rich color and evocative design. One of his most popular books is "The Man Who Could Call Down Owls" (Macmillan, 1984), by Eve Bunting, with his dramatic pencil drawings of the powerful, mysterious birds.
        Among his many honors were the American Library Association Notable Book Award in 1975 for "How Wilka Went to Sea" (Parents Press) and in 1980 for "I Am Joseph" (Lothrop, Lee & Shepard), and The New York Times Best Illustrated Children's Book Award in 1984 for "Babushka: An Old Russian Folk Tale" (Holiday House), which he wrote and illustrated.
        Mr. Mikolaycak had just completed illustrations for "The Hero of Bremen" by Margaret Hedges, to be published by Holiday House in the fall.
        Several of his works were illustrations for folk tales adapted by his wife, a book packager. These include a Dutch holiday story, "A Gift from St. Nicholas" (Holiday House, 1988); a Ukrainian tale, "The Rumor of Pavel and Paali" (Harper & Row, 1988), and "The Boy Who Tried to Cheat Death" (Doubleday, 1971).
        Mr. Mikolaycak was born in Scranton, Pa. He graduated from Pratt Institute, where he studied book illustration; he also studied book design at New York University.
        In his early career, he contributed illustrations to Seventeen, Calling All Girls and other magazines. For 13 years he was a designer on the staff of the Time Life book division, designing books for the Science Library. He also taught illustration at Syracuse University from 1973 to 1983.
        He is survived by his wife.
