        John Hendricks Young, a business and tax lawyer for more than 50 years in New York, died on Tuesday at his home in Bal Harbour, Fla. A former resident of Manhattan and Whitehouse, N.J., he was 82.
        The cause was lung cancer, his family said.
        After World War II, Mr. Young worked with representatives of John D. Rockefeller Jr. to clear the way for a United Nations site on the East Side of Manhattan.
        As an adviser to Vincent Astor during the postwar years, he helped form the Vincent Astor Foundation.
        Mr. Young represented Nancy Carnegie Rockefeller in her opposition to development of Cumberland Island in Georgia. A 1973 legal decision preserved the area under the National Park Service.
        He was also a legal adviser to the New York Mets in the 1970's and served briefly on the team's board.
        Mr. Young became a partner in the Wall Street firm Carter, Ledyard & Milburn in 1947. For the last few years, he was counsel to the international law firm Hughes Hubbard & Reed in Manhattan.
        He was a 1934 graduate of Yale, and in 1937, of the Yale Law School.
        In addition to his wife of 28 years, the former Frederika Cosden, Mr. Young is survived by two children from his first marriage, to Mary Redfern Culley, who died in 1964: a son, John H. Young Jr., and a daughter, Anne Payne Young, both of Riverdale, the Bronx; a brother, Louis C., of Fripp Island, S.C.; a stepdaughter, Judith S. Geiger of Hollywood, Fla., and two stepgrandchildren.
