        Leopold Labedz, a Kremlinologist who lived in London, died at his home there on March 22. He was 73.
        He had a massive heart attack, said Lionel Bloch, his solicitor and friend in London.
        Mr. Labedz was born in Russia, the son of a Polish Army doctor. He was educated in Warsaw and Paris and fought with Gen. Wladyslaw Anders's Polish force under British command in Italy in World War II. Like General Anders, he wound up in British exile after the war.
        He enrolled in the London School of Economics and immersed himself in stacks of newspapers and journals from the Soviet Union and its satellites. In 1955 Walter Laqueur, founder of the periodical Survey: A Journal of East and West Studies, hired him as his editorial assistant.
        Mr. Labedz served as editor of Survey from 1962 to 1989, when his health prevented him from continuing. A firm anti-Communist, he was opposed to detente, which he regarded as equal to the pre-World War II appeasement of Hitler's Germany.
        Mr. Labedz is survived by a daughter, Natalie Copeland of Biggin Hill, England.
