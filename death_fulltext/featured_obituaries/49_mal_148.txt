        William F. Niemi, a former chairman of the Eddie Bauer outdoor apparel stores, died Feb. 9 at a care center in Bellevue, Wash. He was 86 years old.
        Mr. Niemi met Mr. Bauer in the 1940's and frequently hunted and fished with him, said Mr. Niemi's wife, Louise. In 1947, Mr. Niemi and Mr. Bauer began Eddie Bauer as a manufacturing and mail-order business. A retail operation was later added, and in 1968 Mr. Niemi and his son bought out the Bauer family. In 1971, he sold the company to General Mills Inc. and retired.
