        Peter Hess Kurzman, who was the volunteer president of the National Association for Visually Handicapped, died on Monday at his weekend home in Erwinna, Pa. He was 63 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Kurzman graduated from Princeton University. He was a member of Community Board 8 for a time, and assistant commissioner of relocation in the 1960's under Mayor John V. Lindsay.
        He was a director of the Association for Visually Handicapped before becoming its president in 1992.
        He is survived by his wife, Nancy; a sister, Phyllis Gladstone of Miami, and  two brothers, Harold, of Washington, and Paul, of Manhattan.
