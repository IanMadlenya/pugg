        Col. Vermont Garrison, an ace fighter pilot who flew missions in World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War, died on Monday at his home in Mountain Home, Idaho. He was 78.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his daughter Jayne.
        Colonel Garrison became a double jet ace in the Air Force in 1953, when he was the commander of the 335th Fighter Squadron. He flew an F-86 and shot down 10 MIG-15's over North Korea.
        A native of Mount Victory, Ky., he joined the Royal Air Force in World War II, became a fighter pilot and then transferred to the United States Army Air Forces in 1943. (The Air Force did not become a separate military branch until after the war.) Flying P-47's and P-51's, he shot down seven German planes before being downed by ground fire and spending a year as a prisoner of war.
        Colonel Garrison also flew F-4 fighters during the Vietnam War, thus serving combat tours in three wars. He retired in 1973.
        He is survived by his wife, Maria; three daughters, Jayne Garrison of San Francisco, Shelta Reese of New Braunfels, Tex., and Jonna Robison of Colorado Springs, and a son, David, of Buckden, England.
