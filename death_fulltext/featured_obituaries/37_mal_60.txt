        Yeghishe Derderian, Armenian patriarch of Jerusalem and spiritual leader of the 8,000 Armenians in Israel, the occupied West Bank and Jordan, died of a heart attack on Thursday, church officials said today. He was 80 years old.
        The church secretary, George Hintlian, said Patriarch Derderian, one of the three custodians of Jerusalem's Christian holy places, died in his home at the St. James convent and monastery complex in the Old City. He had been ill with influenza for two days.
        Bishop Guregh Kapikian was named acting patriarch.
        Patriarch Derderian was born in Van, in eastern Turkey, and came to Jerusalem in 1922. He studied at the St. James theological seminary, served as its dean before being named deputy patriarch in 1949, and became patriarch of Jerusalem in 1960, Mr. Hintlian said.
        The Armenian Church follows the Eastern rite and does not accept the authority of the Pope.
