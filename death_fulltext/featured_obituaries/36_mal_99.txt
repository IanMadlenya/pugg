        Georgie Auld, a saxophonist who played with Bunny Berigan, Artie Shaw and Benny Goodman, died of lung cancer on Monday at his home here. He was 70 years old.
        Born in Toronto, Mr. Auld, whose real name was John Altweger, was a self-taught saxophonist who did not read music. He was still a teen-ager when he joined Bunny Berigan's orchestra in 1937.
        He played tenor saxophone with the Artie Shaw band from 1938 to 1940, when he became a member of Benny Goodman's orchestra and sextet, playing with instrumentalists like Cootie Williams and Charlie Christian.
        In the 1940's he led his own band, which featured soloists like Sarah Vaughan, Erroll Garner, Dizzy Gillespie and Billy Butterfield.
        Mr. Auld made a number of appearances in Japan in the 1960's and 70's.
        When the saxophonist performed with one of his ensembles at the Blue Note nightclub in New York in 1987, John S. Wilson described his performance in The New York Times as ''rugged, punching, full-toned, rocking through riffs and building huge, voluptuous tones on ballads.'' Mr. Auld's ballads, he continued, were ''full of extended, breathy sighs mingled with firm, anchoring phrases'' and his up-tempo numbers ''exultant but not raucous.''
        In 1977 Mr. Auld appeared in a cameo role as a band leader in the film ''New York, New York,'' which starred Robert De Niro as a saxophonist, and taught Mr. De Niro how to hold the instrument. Mr. Auld also was the principal soloist on the film's soundtrack.
        By 1975 he had recorded nearly 20 albums, including ''Stomping at the Savoy'' and ''A Hundred Years From Today.''
        Surviving are two brothers and a sister.
