        Manuel E. Kulukundis, the Greek-born shipping magnate who went bankrupt in the early 1960's, died of heart failure Tuesday at his home in Southampton, L.I. He was 89 years old.
        Mr. Kulukundis maintained his interest in merchant shipping and continued to work in family enterprises and as a consultant until his death. He also continued to paint, a hobby he began decades ago in London when his sketches of ships on the back of menus at Claridge's became collector's items.
        At its height in the 1950's, the Kulukundis shipping business controlled 25 United States-flagged vessels. Mr. Kulukundis also acquired the Bull Lines, one of the oldest American shipping concerns.
        A longtime leader among Greek shipowners, Mr. Kulukundis became embroiled in controversy in 1954 when he and several others entered into an agreement with Senator Joseph R. McCarthy during the Korean War to refrain from carrying cargo to Communist countries. The incident angered officials in the Eisenhower Administration, who accused the Senator of interfering in the conduct of foreign policy.
        By the mid-1960's the Kulukundis shipping business was heavily in debt, leading to lengthy bankruptcy proceedings that resulted in the Kulukundis fleet being sold at auction. Mr. Kulukundis subsequently tried to re-establish himself but was never able to attain his former place in the shipping industry.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Calliope Hadjilias; two sons, Michael, of Manhattan, and George, of Maryland; two brothers, Nicholas, of Bermuda, and Michael, of Rye, N.Y., and four grandchildren.
