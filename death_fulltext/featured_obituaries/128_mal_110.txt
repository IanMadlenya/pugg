        William Craig, a historian who wrote two best-selling books about World War II, died on Sept. 22 at Norwalk Hospital in Norwalk, Conn. He was 68.
        The cause was complications from kidney disease, said his son Edward.
        Mr. Craig was an advertising salesman in 1958 when he appeared as a contestant on the television quiz show ''Tic Tac Dough.'' He did so well, winning $42,000, that he was able to enroll at Columbia University and earned undergraduate and master's degrees in history. In 1967, he published ''The Fall of Japan,'' an account of the end of the Pacific war. He also wrote ''Enemy at the Gates'' (1973), about the battle of Stalingrad, and several novels.
        In addition to Edward, of Seoul, Korea, he is survived by a daughter, Ellen Craig Perlwitz of Westport, Conn.; another son, William Jr. of Lyme, N.H.; a sister, Ann Hanley, and a brother, Edward, both of Concord, Mass., and eight grandchildren.
        Correction:  October 2, 1997, Thursday
        An obituary on Tuesday about William Craig, a historian, misidentified a surviving son who lives in Seoul, South Korea. His name is Richard; Mr. Craig did not have a son named Edward. The obituary also misidentified the person who reported the cause of death. It was Mr. Craig's son William Jr., not the son misidentified as Edward.
