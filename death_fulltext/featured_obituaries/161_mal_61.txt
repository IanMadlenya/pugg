        Judd Rose, a reporter and anchor for network and cable television news programs, died June 10 at his home in Manhattan. He was 45.
        The cause was cancer, CNN said.
        Mr. Rose appeared on the CNN program ''CNN NewsStand'' as co-anchor from 1998 until late 1999.
        From 1982 to 1998, he was an ABC News reporter and correspondent. For nine of those years, he was a correspondent for the ABC News program ''Prime Time Live.''
        Mr. Rose and Sam Donaldson were co-anchors of a ''Prime Time Live'' special edition about cancer in 1996. Mr. Rose also contributed reports to ''Good Morning America'' and other ABC programs.
        His overseas assignments included the invasion of Panama in 1989 and the Persian Gulf war in 1991. His work also included reports about entertainment and popular culture.
        In a 1995 interview, he said, ''I like to do stories that ask or beg for a sense of humor or a sly take.''
        He received Emmy and Peabody awards for his work.
        Born in Chicago, Mr. Rose attended the University of California at Los Angeles and New York University.
        He worked for NBC News as a writer in radio and later worked in local television in Los Angeles.
        His survivors include his wife, Sarah Strum, and their 19-month-old twins, Jacob and Rachel.
