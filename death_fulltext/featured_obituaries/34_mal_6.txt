        Judson B. Branch, former chairman of the Allstate Insurance Companies, died Monday at Glenbrook Hospital in Glenview, Ill. He was 82 years old and lived in Northfield, Ill.
        An Allstate spokesman would say only that Mr. Branch died after a long illness.
        Mr. Branch, a graduate of the University of Michigan, was with Allstate for 38 years, starting in 1934. He was one of the company's first agents, and in later years he helped revamp the business by establishing over-the-counter sales at Sears Roebuck & Company stores. He was elected president and chief executive officer in 1957 and directed the company's growth through diversification from auto and fire insurance into life, homeowner, commercial and other lines. He was named chairman in 1966.
        Shortly before Mr. Branch retired in 1972, after he reached the company's mandatory retirement age, Allstate had more than $11 billion worth of life insurance in force.
        Mr. Branch also worked to move Allstate into automotive safety advertising, with programs aimed at driver education, the use of seat belts, installation of improved bumpers and air bags on passenger cars. He also pressed for legislation against drunken driving.
        He also served as chairman of the Evanston Hospital Corporation, chairman of the National Motor Vehicle Safety Council, and as a member of the State Department's special advisory committee on public opinion. He was also involved in Boy Scouts, Y.M.C.A. and Junior Achievement activities and was the recipient of numerous awards.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary.
