        Mr. Roberts, a lawyer, represented Alabama's Fourth Congressional District from 1951 to 1965. In 1954 he was shot in the leg when four Puerto Rican proponents of independence for the island opened fire from the visitors' gallery. Four other House members were wounded.
        In his 14 years in the House Mr. Roberts was chairman of two subcommittees dealing with safety. He advocated strong Federal automobile safety standards, air pollution controls, hazardous substance labeling and health care for migrant workers. After he was defeated for re-election in 1964, he returned to private law practice. He also served on the National Highway Safety Advisory Committee. He retired in 1979.
        He is survived by two daughters, Margaret, of Brewton, Ala., and Allison Sinrod, of Potomac; a brother, Luther, of Anniston, Ala. , and four grandchildren.
