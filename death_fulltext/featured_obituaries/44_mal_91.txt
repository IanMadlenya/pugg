        Giancarlo Pajetta, a longtime member of the Italian Communist Party leadership and a member of the nation's Parliament, died on Wednesday at his home in Rome. He was 79 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, Communist Party officials said in Rome.
        Mr. Pajetta, who had served in Parliament since 1946, joined the Communist youth federation in 1927. He was arrested in 1933 and sentenced to 21 years in prison.
        In 1943, after serving 10 years, he was released and became a leader in the anti-Fascist resistance, serving as a vice commander in the Garibaldi Brigade.
        Mr. Pajetta was named editor of the Milan edition of L'Unita, the Communist Party newspaper and later was named regional secretary for Lombardy. He was elected to Parliament in 1946 and became the party's chief spokesman on foreign affairs.
        He was active in trying to prevent Italy's entrance into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and on most issues in the postwar era, following closely the line espoused by the Soviet Union.
        A fiery orator, Mr. Pajetta often badgered other legislators into arguments on the floor of Parliament. He was a member of the Italian Communist Party Politburo and its seven-member Secretariat.
        He is survived by his companion of 30 years, Miriam Mafai; a son, Luca; two daughters, Gaspara and Giovanna, and several grandchildren.
