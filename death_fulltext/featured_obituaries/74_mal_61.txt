        Irving N. Selkin, former chief clerk of the state appeals court in Brooklyn, died on Wednesday at Maimonides Hospital. A Brooklyn resident, he was 83.
        The cause was complications from multiple myeloma, his family reported.
        A graduate of City College, Mr. Selkin received his law degree from New York University Law School in 1932, the year he went to work as a law clerk in the Appellate Division, Second Judicial Department of New York State Supreme Court. The panel hears cases from Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island and Westchester and Putnam Counties.
        Mr. Selkin rose to the position of chief clerk and administrative officer in 1971 and held it until his retirement in 1986. He then practiced law privately in Brooklyn until shortly before his death.
        He was a past president of Temple Emanu-El of Borough Park.
        Mr. Selkin is survived by his wife of 54 years, the former Sylvia Silver; two sons, Dr. Stuart G., of Melville, L.I., and Donald, of Manhattan; a sister, Dorothy Gilbert of Boca Raton, Fla., and seven grandchildren.
