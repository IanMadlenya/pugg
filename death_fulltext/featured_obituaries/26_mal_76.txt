        Fred Mogubgub, an artist and animator, died of bone cancer on Thursday at his home in Cliffside Park, N.J. He was 61 years old.
        Mr. Mogubgub created many animated films, television shows and advertising campaigns, and several of his movies are in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art. He was known in the 1960's for his innovative fast-cut style and such offbeat commercials and films as ''Enter Hamlet'' and ''The Day I Met Zet.''
        One of Mr. Mogubgub's best-known Pop artworks was a huge sign erected in midtown Manhattan in 1965 that read, ''Why Doesn't Someone Give Mogubgub Ltd. Two Million Dollars to Make a Movie?'' His works, ranging in style from abstract to realistic, were exhibited in many New York galleries, and his 25-by-30-foot fantasy, ''Virginia's Garden,'' was said to be one of the world's largest paintings.
        Mr. Mogubgub is survived by his wife, Virginia, and two sons, Fred Jr. and Sam, all of Cliffside Park, and by two sisters, Lorraine Simmons of Lenoir, N.C., and Dolores Corby of Ocean City, N.J.
