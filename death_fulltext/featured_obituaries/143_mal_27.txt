        Michael Zaslow, an Emmy Award-winning actor who played a victim of Lou Gehrig's disease on the soap opera ''One Life to Live'' and who struggled with the illness in real life, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 54.
        The cause was a heart attack,  Brynn Thayer, who played his wife on the show in the 1980's, said.
        Mr. Zaslow won a daytime Emmy Award as best actor in 1994 for his role as the villainous Roger Thorpe on CBS's ''Guiding Light,'' a role he played at various times for 25 years. He was dismissed from the show in April 1997, some eight months after the early symptoms of his illness  caused his speech to slur.
        In May, Mr. Zaslow appeared on ABC's ''One Life to Live,'' reprising his role as the pianist David Renaldi, which he had played from 1983 to 1986. When Lou Gehrig's disease, or  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, was diagnosed in late 1997, he incorporated the degenerative nervous-system disorder into the life of his character to raise awareness about it. With his wife, Susan Hufford, Ms. Thayer and other friends, he founded Zazangels, an organization under the umbrella of the Greater New York Chapter of the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Association that works for a cure.
        Mr. Zaslow's last appearance on ''One Life to Live,'' a Thanksgiving segment, was broadcast on Dec. 1.
        Mr. Zaslow also appeared in the 1977 movie ''You Light Up My Life'' and the television series ''Law and Order.'' He appeared in the Broadway productions of ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,'' ''Fiddler on the Roof'' and ''Boccaccio,'' as well as in Off Broadway and regional productions.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Marika Hufford-Zaslow and Helena Hufford-Zaslow, both of Manhattan.
