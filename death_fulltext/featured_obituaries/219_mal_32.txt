        Wilson Carey McWilliams, a political scientist who took a special interest in the moral basis of politics, died on March 29 at his home in Flemington, N.J. He was 71.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        He was a professor in the department of political science at Rutgers University and at its Institute for the Study of Civic Values, which he helped found in 1973. He joined the Rutgers faculty in 1970.
        Dr. McWilliams wrote ''The Idea of Fraternity in America'' (1973), in which he examined the contributions of political and literary commentators and institutions concerned with that concept. He also wrote ''Military Honor After Mylai'' (1972).
        More recently he published ''The Politics of Disappointment: American Elections, 1976-1994'' (1995) and an update, ''Beyond the Politics of Disappointment?: American Elections, 1980-1998'' (2000).
        Dr. McWilliams contributed to Gerald M. Pomper's election post-mortems, starting with ''The Election of 1976: Reports and Interpretations'' (1977), followed by updates for the national elections of 1980 through 1992.
        He joined Michael Gibbons in editing ''The Federalists, the Antifederalists and the American Political Tradition'' (1992), and over the years wrote many articles for national publications.
        Wilson Carey McWilliams was born in Santa Monica, Calif. He graduated from the University of California at Berkeley in 1955 and served as an Army lieutenant. Returning to Berkeley, he received a master's degree in 1960 and a doctorate in 1966.
        He set out as an instructor at Oberlin College in 1961 and taught as an associate professor at Brooklyn College from 1967 to 1970, when he moved to Rutgers.
        At his death he was also the vice president of the Institute for the Study of Civic Values, based in Philadelphia, through which he sought to put into practice what he taught about citizens' personal engagement in their government. The institute supports a national network of community and neighborhood activists working toward that end.
        Dr. McWilliams is survived by his wife of 38 years, Nancy Riley McWilliams; two daughters, Susan Jane, of Princeton, N.J., and Helen Elizabeth, of Boston; and his stepmother, Iris McWilliams of Manhattan.
        Correction:  April 15, 2005, Friday  Because of an editing error, an obituary on Monday about Wilson Carey McWilliams, a political science scholar at Rutgers University, misstated the affiliation of the Institute for the Study of Civic Values, which he helped found. It is a freestanding institution in Philadelphia, not part of Rutgers.
