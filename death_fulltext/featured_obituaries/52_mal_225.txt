        Ed Dodd, creator of the comic strip "Mark Trail," died Monday at Northeast Georgia Medical Center. He was 88 years old.
        A spokeswoman for the hospital, Blanche Barrett, said Mr. Dodd had been ill for some time, but she declined to disclose the cause of death.
        Mr. Dodd started "Mark Trail" in 1946. Its title character is an outdoor writer, and its theme is the outdoors, wildlife and conservation.
        In 1978, as his eyesight failed, Mr. Dodd turned the comic strip over to Jack Elrod, a Gainesville artist, who continues to draw it under both their names. Through Publishers-Hall Syndicate, it is carried by more than 200 newspapers.
        Mr. Dodd, whose full name was Edward Benton Dodd, was a native of La Fayette, Ga.
        He began his career as a cartoonist in 1929 in New York and drew a humor panel, "Back Home Again," from 1930 to 1945.
        Among his books were "Mark Trail's Book of North American Mammals," "Mark Trail's Outdoor Tips" and "Today's World of Conservation."
        Mr. Dodd is survived by his wife, Rosemary, four stepchildren and two grandchildren.
