        Gerald Newman, the chief accountant for the McDonald's Corporation of Oak Brook, Ill., died Saturday on his way to a fund-raising event in Cleveland for the Ronald McDonald Children's Charities. He was 61 years old and lived in Highland Park, Ill.
        He died of a heart attack, the company said.
        A native of Chicago, Mr. Newman graduated from Roosevelt University in Chicago and joined the quick-service food chain in 1961. Holding successive management posts, he became vice president and controller in 1970, executive vice president in 1973 and senior executive vice president and chief accounting officer in 1980. In that position, he was the keeper of McDonald's accounts worldwide.
        "He was a true pioneer of our system, especially as it is involved in the evolution of our franchise relationships," said Michael R. Quinlan, McDonald's chairman and chief executive. "He was also one of the founders of Ronald McDonald Children's Charities and was president of R.M.C.C. In that capacity, he helped create and lead a charitable effort that has benefited thousands of children all over the world."
        Mr. Newman is survived by his wife, the former Bobbi Greenblatt; two sons, Jeffrey Newman of Northbrook, Ill. and Marc Newman of Buffalo Grove, Ill.; a sister, Eleanor Silverman, and two granddaughters.
