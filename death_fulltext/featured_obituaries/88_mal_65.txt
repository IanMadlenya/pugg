        Rustum Bastuni, a retired New York architect and campaigner for Palestinian-Israeli conciliation, died on April 25 at his home on the Upper West Side. He was 71.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Bastuni was born in Palestine near Haifa, trained at Technion, the Israel Institute of Technology, and became an assistant town planner in Haifa. He also planned permanent housing in the Negev for Bedouin, a nomadic people, on behalf of the Israeli Government.
        He served as an Arab member of the Israeli Parliament from 1951 to 1955 and as an Israeli delegate to international peace congresses. He also contributed articles to various publications and had a weekly broadcast on Israeli radio.
        After coming to the United States in 1969, he lectured at universities around the country on the prospects for peace in the Middle East. He was an adjunct professor of Middle East history at the State University of New York at Purchase in the 1970's and played an active role in a number of organizations working for peace and international understanding.
        He retired six years ago as chief architect and planner of buildings and grounds at the New York City Technical College in Brooklyn, City University of New York.
        Mr. Bastuni is survived by his wife, Janice Goldsmith Bastuni, and two sons by a previous marriage, Ahmad, of Los Angeles, and Omar, of Manhattan.
