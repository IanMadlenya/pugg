        Before moving to Washington with Mr. Agnew in 1969, Mr. Malatesta was a fund raiser for the Republican Party in California. A nephew of Bob Hope, he organized parties for the Republicans that included celebrities like Frank Sinatra.
        After Mr. Agnew resigned in 1973, Mr. Malatesta became an Assistant Secretary of Commerce. He later co-founded the Pisces Club in Georgetown and opened Peter's Restaurant in Alexandria.
        He returned to California in 1983 and was an executive with the Four Winds Corporation. Last year he bought Miracles Cafe, a restaurant in Cardiff-by-the-Sea, Calif.
        In 1982 he wrote a book entitled ''Party Politics: Confessions of a Washington Party-Giver,'' published by Prentice-Hall.
        He is survived by his parents, Mildred and John B. Malatesta Jr. of Palm Springs, Calif.; a brother, Thomas of Washington, and two aunts, Dolores Defina Hope of Palm Springs, Calif., and Vera Dellert of Manhattan.
