        Dr. Melvin Moore, a Brooklyn radiologist practicing in Bensonhurst for 35 years, died suddenly on Sunday. He was 68 years old and lived in Brooklyn.
        He died of a heart attack as he was driving a car on Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn, his family said. They said there were no other injuries.
        Dr. Moore, a graduate of the Chicago Medical School, was an attending physician and former director of radiology at Coney Island Hospital. He was one of the first local radiologists to use mammography and ultrasound. He was active in Jewish community affairs and at the time of his death was vice president of the Brooklyn Philharmonic.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Elaine Pohl; a daughter, Abigail Moore, and a son, Eli, both of Manhattan; a sister, Ruth Ross of Brooklyn, and two grandchildren.
