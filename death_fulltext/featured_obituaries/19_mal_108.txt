        Karl Schriftgiesser, an author and retired journalist, died yesterday at the Gill Oddfellows nursing home in Ludlow, Vt. He was 84 years old and had lived in retirement for many years in Londonderry, Vt.
        Mr. Schriftgiesser, a native of Boston, was a graduate of the Roxbury Latin School and the Goddard Seminary in Barre, Vt.
        Mr. Schriftgiesser began his writing career in the early 1920's as a feature writer for The Boston Transcript and in 1933 became an editorial writer for The Washington Post. He later joined The New York Post and eventually The New York Times, where he was acting drama editor during World War II. He became book editor of Newsweek in 1945. In 1953 he joined the public relations staff of the Committee for Economic Development, retiring in 1969.
        Among the dozen books he wrote, mostly on current events, were ''Families: From the Adamses to the Roosevelts,'' ''The Lobbyists'' and ''This Was Normalcy,'' an account of American politics in the era from the Presidency of Warren G. Harding through that of Herbert H. Hoover.
        Survivors include his wife, the former Ruth Mansfield; a daughter, Karla Irvine of Cincinnati, and a granddaughter.
