        Albert A. Carretta, who as a member of the Federal Trade Commission wrote a 1953 decision allowing businesses to advertise ''free'' goods along with merchandise for sale, died of a heart attack on Saturday while visiting a son in Santa Rosa, Calif. He was 88 and lived in Arlington, Va.
        Mr. Carretta was a native of New York and a graduate of City College, where he taught economics before moving to Washington in 1934 to join the newly formed Securities and Exchange Commission.
        He studied law at Georgetown University and, after passing the bar exam, began teaching law in 1942 at the Catholic University Law School. After World War II service in the Navy, he returned to Washington to practice law and teach.
        In 1952 President Harry S. Truman appointed Mr. Carretta to the Federal Trade Commission, which at the time focused on preventing monopolies and on enforcing rules intended to prevent collusive practices by companies within an industry.
        Mr. Carretta wrote the decision in 1953 that allowed companies to use the word ''free'' in connection with goods they gave away if other goods were bought, thus reversing a 1948 F.T.C. ruling that banned the word ''free'' as unfair unless no purchase was required. The case involved two mail order book clubs that offered free books to people who signed up for deliveries of mystery novels.
        He left the commission in 1954 to return to law practice, representing manufacturers and trade associations before Federal regulatory agencies until he retired in 1989. He was also in demand as a speaker and was known for his denunciations of unfair trade practices.
        Mr. Carretta, whose wife, Gertrude, died in 1992, is survived by 2 sons, William J., of Santa Rosa, and John V., of Fort Wayne, Ind., 11 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren.
