        The Rev. Lyman Cunningham Ogilby, retired bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania, died on Saturday at Sacred Heart Hospital in Spokane, Wash., where he was attending a consecration. He was 68 years old and lived in Philadelphia.
        He died of pulmonary failure, a spokeswoman for the diocese said.
        Bishop Ogilby was head of the 74,000-member diocese from 1974 to 1987, a period that included the ordination of the first women as Episcopal priests.
        He at first disapproved of the ordination of 11 women in Philadelphia in July 1974 without the recommendation of the standing committees of their dioceses. But he later concluded that while the ordinations were uncanonical and irregular, they were valid. Support for Woman as Bishop
        In 1980 he ordained Barbara Harris to the priesthood and in 1988 he was a supporter of her ordination as the first woman to become a bishop of the Episcopal Church.
        After service in the Navy in World War II, he was graduated from the Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, Mass., and was ordained a priest in 1950. He served as bishop in the Philippines and in South Dakota but resigned both posts to allow for the election of indigenous bishops.
        He is survived by his wife, Ruth; two sons, Henry of Bowdoinham, Me., and Peter of Albuquerque, N.M.; a daughter, Lois Ogilby-Rosen of Stanford, Calif.; two brothers, Alexander of Middletown, Del., and Peter of Honolulu, and three grandchildren.
