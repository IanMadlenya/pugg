        Jonathan Schenker, an executive with Ketchum Communications, died yesterday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 42.
        The cause was complications from AIDS, said his companion, Peter Carzasty.
        At his death, Mr. Schenker was senior vice president and director for media relations for Ketchum, a New York-based public relations agency. In 1981, when the Gay Men's Health Crisis was established, he volunteered to help develop and promote its first fund-raising campaign.
        In the early 1980's he also was director of broadcast relations for the American Jewish Committee and the host of a weekly interview program "In Person," for WEVD radio.
        Besides Mr. Carzasty, he is survived by his parents, Nathan and Harriet Schenker of Solon, Ohio, and two brothers, Richard, of Chicago and Barry, of Buffalo.
