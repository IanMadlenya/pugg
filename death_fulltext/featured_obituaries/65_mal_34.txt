        Victor Alexander, a designer of women's fashions and co-owner of the Countess Alexander dress shops, died on May 11 in West Palm Beach, Fla. He was 79 years old and lived in Palm Beach and Southampton, L.I.
        Mr. Alexander died of cancer, said his nephew, Garo Alexanian.
        Born of Armenian descent in Istanbul, Turkey, Mr. Alexander immigrated to New York in 1931 when he was 7 years old. As a young man, he worked as a stockbroker for Bache & Company for 10 years before starting Countess Alexander with his wife, Jennie. The company, which was named in honor of Mr. Alexander's ancestry in czarist Russia, produced clothes for many well-known boutique dress shops and department stores like Saks Fifth Avenue. It also designed dresses for many prominent women, including Pat Nixon and Lady Bird Johnson.
        In 1972, the Alexanders quit the manufacturing business in New York and opened their first Countess Alexander retail shop in Boca Raton, Fla. They closed that shop in 1978 when they moved to Palm Beach and opened a shop there.
        They closed that shop in January, when Mr. Alexander's illness was discovered.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Alexander is survived by two sons, Robert, and Ronnie, and a brother, Kegam, all of New York City.
