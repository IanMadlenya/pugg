        William Dozier, who produced the campy "Batman" television series, died on Tuesday at St. John's Hospital and Health Center here. He was 83 years old.
        A hospital spokeswoman said he died of a stroke.
        Mr. Dozier was born in Omaha, studied at Creighton University and became a talent agent. He later became the head of Paramount's story and writing department and subsequently worked at RKO, Columbia and Goldwyn in the 1940's. From 1951 to 1959, he was in programming at CBS.
        He worked at Screen Gems in the early 1960's, then became president of Greenway Productions, which made "Batman" from 1966 to 1968 for ABC. Mr. Dozier also produced "The Green Hornet" in 1966 and 1967.
        He is survived by his wife, Ann Rutherford; a son, Robert; a daughter, Deborah Potter; a stepdaughter, Gloria May, and four grandchildren.
