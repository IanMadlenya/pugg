        Katherine Locke, who appeared on Broadway and in films, died on Tuesday at her home in Thousand Oaks, Calif. She was 85.
        Ms. Locke made her stage debut in 1928 in "The Joy of Serpents" at the Provincetown Playhouse in Greenwich Village. She followed that with bit parts in "Firebird" (with Judith Anderson), "Halfway to Hell" and "If a Body."
        Her big break came when she was cast opposite John Garfield in Arthur Kober's 1937 Broadway comedy, "Having Wonderful Time." She went on to play Ophelia to Maurice Evans's Hamlet in 1938 and appeared with Franchot Tone and Lee J. Cobb in a 1940 adaptation of "The Fifth Column," Ernest Hemingway's play about the civil war in Spain.
        Her screen credits include "The Seventh Cross" (1944), "The Snake Pit" (1948) and "People Will Talk" (1951).
        She is survived by her husband, the writer and producer Norman Corwin; a daughter, Diane Corwin Okarski of Spokane, Wash., and a son, Anthony, of Thousand Oaks.
