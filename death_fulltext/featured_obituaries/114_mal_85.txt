        Dr. John Gamble Harter, a clinical researcher who pioneered a revised treatment for people suffering from asthma and arthritis, died on July 11 at Shady Grove Adventist Hospital in Rockville, Md. He was 69 and lived in Darnestown, Md.
        The cause was liver cancer, said his wife, Mary Douglas Tyson.
        Dr. Harter spent 22 years at the Food and Drug Administration. He joined the agency in 1973 as a medical officer, reviewing new drug applications. In 1989 he became director of the Pilot Drug Evaluation Staff, a group established that year to expedite the drug review process. He retired from the agency in 1994.
        He was born in Columbus, Ohio, and graduated from Ohio State University and Harvard Medical School. As an assistant clinical professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School from 1956 to 1967,he pioneered the use of alternative-day steroids for steroid-dependent asthmatics and arthritis sufferers, who had previously received daily injections.
        Dr. George W. Thorn, a former Harvard Medical School professor and authority  on endocrinology who worked closely with Dr. Harter during his stay in Boston, said, "Using his treatment, patients could get relief without the disabling side effects of daily cortisone injections," particularly a thinning of the bones and skin.
        In addition to his wife, Dr. Harter is survived by five children from a former marriage, Carol A. Harter of San Diego, Nancy L. Harter of Tavernier, Fla., Thomas E. Harter of New York City, James G. Harter of Austin, Tex., Laura  S. Harter of Redwood City, Calif.; a brother, Seth W. Harter, of Holmdel, N.J.,  and nine grandchildren.
