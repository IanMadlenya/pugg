        Alfred T. Lee, a trademark lawyer, died on Friday at his home in Amawalk, N.Y. He was 65 years old and had another home in the Murray Hill section of Manhattan.
        He died of cancer of the pancreas, said Sandy Rosen, a partner of Mr. Lee's in the New York office of the Los Angeles-based law firm of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker. Mr. Lee was the senior partner in charge of the office's intellectual property department.
        He grew up in Queens, earned bachelor's and law degrees from St. John's University and was a partner in two New York law firms before going to Paul, Hastings.
        Mr. Lee's first marriage, to Doris Noble, ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, the former Barbara Re; three children from his first marriage, Christopher, of San Francisco, Stephen, of Ossining, N.Y., and Karen Ann Iacobino of Piscataway, N.J.; a daughter from his second marriage, Stacy Lee of Amawalk; a stepdaughter, Kathleen Olson of Golden's Bridge, N.Y., and five grandchildren.
