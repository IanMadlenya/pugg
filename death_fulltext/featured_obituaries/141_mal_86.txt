        Former Gov. Burton Melvin Cross of Maine, a Republican who advocated states' rights, fiscal conservatism and local government responsibility, died on Thursday at his home in Augusta. He was 95.
        Mr. Cross, a former city and state legislator, won election as governor in a four-man race in 1952. But he lost a bid for re-election two years later to Edmund S. Muskie, the future Democratic Senator and Secretary of State, who was running as the underdog.
        Mr. Cross entered the State House of Representatives in 1941 and moved to the State Senate in 1945. As Governor he oversaw the restoration of the Governor's residence.
        He was born in a farmhouse built in 1840 by his great-great-grandfather in Gardiner, Me. Mr. Cross was 8 when his father died and later worked with his two brothers to maintain the family farm.
        He graduated from high school and became a professional florist. Thwarted in his ambition to practice law, he resolved to help write the laws instead and won election to the City Common Council of Augusta. He rose to council president and also served on the Board of Aldermen before entering the Legislature.
        Mr. Cross is survived by two daughters, Barbara Butler, of Farmingdale and Southport, Me., and Nancy Worthing, of Thomaston, Me.; nine granddaughters, and 21 great-grandchildren. His wife, Olena Moulton Cross, died on Aug. 12 after 70 years of marriage.
