        Donald Glen Fink, an engineer who worked to advance television technology beginning in the 1940's, died on Friday at Northern Westchester Hospital Center  in Mount Kisco, N.Y. He was 84 and a longtime resident of Somers, N.Y.
        As a writer for Electronics magazine, joining the staff in 1934 and later becoming editor in chief, he was recruited by national committees charged with developing television standards.
        In 1949, he was the Chairman of the Radio Industry's Joint Technical Advisory Committee, advocating caution in the approval of color television, and  one year later was on a committee that worked to develop basic standards for color television.
        He was the author of "Principles of TV Engineering" (1940), which became a standard text for people working in television development. Among his other books were "Computers and the Human Mind, an Introduction to Artificial Intelligence" (1966), which was used in high-school computer classes.
        Mr. Fink is survived by his wife, Alice Berry Fink; two daughters, Kathleen Marion Fink of Arlington, Mass., and Susan Carol Fink Rudman of Boulder, Colo.;  a son, Stephen Donald Fink of Andover, Mass., and four grandchildren.
