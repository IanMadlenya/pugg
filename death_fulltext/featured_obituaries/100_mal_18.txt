        Allan Oakely Hunter, a former Congressman from California who led the Federal National Mortgage Association in the 1970's, died on Tuesday in a hospital in Bethesda, Md. He was 78.
        Mr. Hunter, who lived in Bethesda and Naples, Fla., died after a heart attack, said his wife, Dixie Lee.
        He was elected to Congress in 1950 as a Republican from Fresno, Calif., and served two terms before losing a re-election bid in 1954 and resuming a private law practice.
        In 1970 Mr. Hunter was named by President Richard M. Nixon as chief executive of the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, a private corporation that buys mortgages from direct lenders, freeing up money for more lending.
        Under his stewardship, which ended in 1981, Fannie Mae grew in importance as a mortgage lender. But in the late 1970's, sharply rising interest rates caught Fannie Mae in the same trap that snared other mortgage lenders.
        "Fannie Mae had tremendous problems when the rates they were paying to borrow rose above the rates they were lending on mortgages," said Stan Strachan, editor of National Mortgage News, a weekly that covers the mortgage industry.
        Mr. Hunter's first marriage, to the former Geene Hunter, ended in divorce. Besides his wife, Dixie Lee, he is survived by three children and six grandchildren.
