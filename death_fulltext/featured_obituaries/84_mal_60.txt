        Dr. Anthony G. Borden, a radiologist and former national commander of the Order of St. Andrew the Apostle, an organization affiliated with the Greek Orthodox Church, died last Thursday at the Fox Chase Hospital in Fox Chase, Pa. He was 79 and lived in Rydal, Pa.
        He had been ill for a long time, his family said.
        Dr. Borden was chief of the radiology department of the Southern Division of the Albert Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia. He also taught at the University of Pennsylvania and at the Temple and Thomas Jefferson Schools of Medicine.
        He was born on the Greek island of Crete and came to the United States after receiving his medical degree from the University of Athens in 1946.
        In 1975, he was appointed national commander of the Order of St. Andrew the Apostle by Archbishop Iakovos, Primate of the Greek Orthodox Church of North and South America. Dr. Borden served in that post for more than 10 years.
        In 1989 he received the order's Athenagorean Human Rights Award for his work in preserving religious freedom and human rights for the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Istanbul and its Greek Orthodox communicants in Turkey.
        He is survived by his wife of 44 years, the former Lillian Valergakis; a daughter, Dr. Maria Limberakis, a family practitioner in North Philadelphia; a son, George, a lawyer in Washington, and three grandchildren.
