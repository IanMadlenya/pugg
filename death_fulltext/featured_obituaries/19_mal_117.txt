        Jean-Paul Aron, a philosopher and writer who announced last year that he was suffering from AIDS, died Saturday, hospital officials said. He was 61 years old.
        Mr. Aron, a nephew of the French philosopher Raymond Aron, taught philosophy at the universities of Tourcoing and Lille, wrote books on the sociology of the 19th century, published novels, produced plays and wrote for the newspapers Le Matin and Le Monde.
        In an interview on French television, Mr. Aron said he announced that he had AIDS because he felt an obligation to break the ''taboo'' surrounding acquired immune deficiency syndrome, which attacks the body's immune system.
