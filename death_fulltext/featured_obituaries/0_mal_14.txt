        Mr. Zeiler, who had been in private practice since 1976, was in Brazil with his fiancee, Regina Darby. They were to be married next spring.
        Ms. Darby, a partner in the Manhattan law firm of Barnes & Darby, said yesterday that it was not yet clear why Mr. Zeiler, a good swimmer, had drowned.
        Mr. Zeiler, who grew up in Larchmont, N.Y., was a 1968 graduate of the University of Southern California Law School. Before establishing his own law practice, Mr. Zeiler sold commercial real estate, before becoming first a staff counsel to the United Federation of Teachers and later a staff attorney with the Legal Aid Society.
        Surivors are a stepdaughter, Tia McDowell; his parents, Theodore and Eva Zeiler, of Atlanta; a brother, Michael Zeiler, also of Atlanta; a sister, Eleanor Falit of Ann Arbor, Mich., and two grandchildren.
