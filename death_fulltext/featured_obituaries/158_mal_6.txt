        Dennis Danell, a guitarist in the influential Orange County punk band Social Distortion, died Tuesday after collapsing at his home in Newport Beach, Calif. He was 38.
        The cause apparently was a brain aneurysm, said Jim Guerinot, the band's manager.
        Mr. Danell had embodied the punk spirit since his days at Troy High School in Fullerton, Calif., when he and his friend and fellow band member, the singer and songwriter Mike Ness, stood out by virtue of their leather jackets and daring haircuts.
        In Social Distortion, his friendship with Mr. Ness was as important as his aggressive rhythm guitar playing. His sunny disposition complemented the brooding Mr. Ness, and he helped his bandmate overcome heroin addiction in the late 1980's.
        Mr. Danell did not even know how to play the guitar when Mr. Ness brought him into the band, but over the course of the band's seven albums his musical involvement increased. He occasionally co-wrote songs, including several on 1988's ''Prison Bound.'' He also formed another band, Fuel, with John Mauer, Social Distortion's bassist, in 1994.
        He is survived by his wife, Christie; his mother, Dee; a son; a daughter; three brothers; and a sister.
