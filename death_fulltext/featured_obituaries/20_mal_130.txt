        Joe Don Looney, a former football star at the University of Oklahoma who was known for his eccentricities on and off the field, died Saturday in a motorcycle accident. He was 45 years old.
        The Texas Department of Public Safety said Mr. Looney was thrown off his motorcycle about 8:30 A.M. after he failed to negotiate a curve on a highway about 45 miles south of here.
        A muscular 230-pound running back with sprinter's speed, he helped Oklahoma win a Big Eight championship in 1962 and earn an Orange Bowl berth.
        Mr. Looney played for five teams in a National Football League career that lasted four years.
        He amazed his first pro coach, Allie Sherman of the New York Giants, by refusing to tape his ankles. ''I know more about my ankles than you do,'' he told the coach.
        Under Coach Don Shula, Mr. Looney helped the Baltimore Colts win a Western Conference championship. But Mr. Shula said of the player: ''I was afraid to put Looney in the game to punt because I didn't know if he would punt. He might do anything.''
        He eventually settled near Alpine, 80 miles from the Mexican border, living alone in a solar-heated home without electricity or telephone.
        Mr. Looney is survived by his daughter, Tara Jeane Looney of Gainesville, Fla., his mother, Dorothy Looney of San Angelo, Tex., and his father, Don Looney of Houston.
