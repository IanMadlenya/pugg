        Mr. Boatner joined the Ink Spots in 1952. The group reached its heyday in the 1930's and 40's with such songs as ''Java Jive'' and ''If I Didn't Care.'' Its four original members are dead. ''I'm the closest you get to an original,'' Mr. Boatner said.
        He is survived by his wife, a daughter, a stepson and stepdaughter, and five grandchildren.
