        Dr. Edgar Andrew Bering Jr., a pediatric neurosurgeon and researcher who devised a wound dressing widely used on combat casualties in World War II, died on Thursday at his summer home in Islesboro, Me. He was 77 and lived in Oxford, Md.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        Serving in the Navy during the war, Dr. Bering invented a foam sponge made with an insoluble blood protein called fibrin to dress wounds and control hemorrhaging. He received the patent for the sponge and also contributed to the development of dressings already treated with antibiotics. He was later stationed in the Pacific and reached the rank of Lieutenant Commander.
        Born in Salt Lake City, he graduated from the University of Utah and Harvard Medical School. After the war, he joined the Harvard faculty. From 1963 to 1972 he worked at the National Institutes of Health in Washington. He then joined the staff of Memorial Hospital in Easton, Md. He retired in 1987.
        A competitive alpine skier, he was a member of the United States Ski Team and won the downhill at the first Pan-American Winter Games in Chile in 1936. He remained active in the sport in later years as a race official and medical volunteer at international competitions.
        Dr. Bering is survived by his wife of 50 years, Harriet Aldrich Bering; two sons, Dr. Edgar A. 3d, of Houston, and Charles C., of Watertown, Mass.; a daughter, Dr. Harriet B. Hoder of Lexington, Mass.; and six grandchildren.
