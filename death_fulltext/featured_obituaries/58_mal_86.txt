        George C. P. Olsson, a former chairman of Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc., a farmers' cooperative that now has more than 800 grower-members and annual sales of almost $1 billion, died Wednesday in Jordan Hospital in Plymouth, Mass. He was 88 years old and lived in Plymouth.
        He died of heart failure after being in declining health for the past year, said his son Philip C. Olsson of Washington.
        Mr. Olsson, who was trained as a lawyer, bought a joint interest in a cranberry bog in Middleboro, Mass., in 1953 and then was elected a member of the cooperative's board of directors, which he went on to head from 1958 until 1973. From then until his retirement in 1976 he was on the cooperative's staff, handling government relations.
        When he became chairman, Ocean Spray's revenues came primarily from sales of fresh fruit and from cranberry sauce around Thanksgiving and Christmas. But the cooperative subsequently made an effort to diversify, and juice products now make up more than 80 percent of its business.
        More than 700 of the current Ocean Spray members grow cranberries, and more than 100 grow grapefruit. Its operations are mainly the production, distribution and marketing of the fruit. Its headquarters complex straddles the border between the towns of Lakeville and Middleboro in Massachussetts, and its cranberries grow in Massachusetts, Wisconsin, New Jersey, Washington, Oregon and Canada. Its grapefruit grow in Florida.
        Mr. Olsson was born in Boston, grew up in Brockton, Mass., and graduated from Boston University Law School in 1926. In 1929 he was first elected clerk of courts for Plymouth County, Mass., a post he held until 1959, with time out for Navy service in World War II.
        In addition to his son Philip, he is survived by his wife, the former Mary A. Craig; a brother, Arnold W. of Worcester, Mass.; a son, Dexter A. of Riegelsville, Pa., and six grandchildren.
