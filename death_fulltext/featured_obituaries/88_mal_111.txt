        William Pearce, the chairman of the National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame Inc., died on Friday in Hilton Head, S.C., while traveling from his home in Palm City, Fla., to his home in Lawrenceville, N.J. He was 73.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Pearce, a retired senior vice president of the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of New York, previously served as vice chairman and president of the foundation, which is based in Larchmont, N.Y. A member of its board since 1978, he became chairman in 1990.
        The foundation represents amateur football, awards scholarships, runs the College Hall of Fame and honors outstanding players. Mr. Pearce broke ground for the hall's new home in South Bend, Ind., a month ago.
        A native of Cincinnati, he attended Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. He enlisted in the Naval Air Corps in 1942 and eared the Distinguished Flying Cross and three Air Medals.
        He joined Coca-Cola Bottling in Cincinnati in 1948 and held various managerial positions before he became a vice president in New York in 1971.
        Mr. Pearce is survived by his wife, Shirley; two sons, William Jr., and Thomas A.; a daughter, Anne E. Wiseman; three sisters, Kathryn Joerg, Loretta Kock and Emma Gaede; two brothers, James, and Harry E., and three grandchildren.
