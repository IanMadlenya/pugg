        Brother Gregory Paul Sprissler, president of LaSalle University from 1945 to 1952, died Saturday at Germantown Hospital. He was 83 years old and lived in Philadelphia.
        He joined LaSalle's chemistry department in 1941 and became dean of the college in 1944. After resigning the presidency, he taught in Baltimore for a year before returning to LaSalle as dean of the evening division. He retired from that post in 1961 but taught chemistry until 1972.
        He is survived by three sisters and two brothers.
