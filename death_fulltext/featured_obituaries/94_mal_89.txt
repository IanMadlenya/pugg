        Paul Dean Woodring, who wrote about education in the United States and offered suggestions for reforms, died last Saturday at his home in Bellingham, Wash. He was 87.
        The cause was leukemia, according to Western Washington University, with which he had been associated since 1939 as a teacher or administrator.
        Dr. Woodring was best known for his books "Let's Talk Sense About Our Schools" (McGraw-Hill, 1953), "A Fourth of a Nation" (McGraw-Hill, 1957) and "The Higher Learning in America: A Reassessment" (McGraw-Hill, 1968). He and John Scanlon edited "American Education Today" (McGraw-Hill, 1963).
        Together with James Cass, Dr. Woodring edited "Education in America," a four-volume collection of supplements on a number of subjects involving education at all levels and printed monthly in The Saturday Review. The collection was published by Ayer in 1971 and remains in print. He also contributed articles to magazines and newspapers throughout the country.
        Throughout his career, Dr. Woodring served as an adviser and consultant. The Ford Foundation called him to New York in 1956 to serve as an adviser to its Fund for the Advancement of Education. At the time, he was the Saturday Review's education editor; he remained an editor at large for four years after his return to the Bellingham campus in 1962.
        Western Washington named its Woodring College of Education in his honor. He retired as Distinguished Service Professor emeritus from the university's department of psychology in 1986.
        He was born in Delta, Ohio, and received a bachelor's degree in education from Bowling Green State University and an M.A. and Ph.D. in psychology from Ohio State University.
        He is survived by a sister, Edna Patelzick of Bellingham. His wife of more than 50 years, Jeannette McGraw Woodring, died in 1989.
