        Willard Philip Scott, a retired New York lawyer who specialized in corporate and financial law, died on Friday in a nursing home in Oklahoma City. He was 85. A former resident of Scarsdale, N.Y., he had lived in Oklahoma City since 1968.
        He suffered a lengthy illness, his family said.
        Mr. Scott was born in Columbus, Ohio. He was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Ohio State University and received his law degree from Columbia University. He joined the law firm of Oliver & Donnally, of New York and Washington, and rose to the position of senior partner.
        The firm served as general counsel of the American Potash and Chemical Corporation, of which Mr. Scott became a director in 1951. Remaining with the law firm, he was appointed a vice president of the company in 1955 and vice chairman in 1968. When American Potash merged with the Kerr-McGee Corporation of Oklahoma City, he moved there as that company's vice president and general counsel. He retired as a senior vice president in 1974.
        Earlier, he represented institutional bondholder groups in the financial reorganization of many railroads and several defaulted municipalities, including Atlantic City and Toledo, Ohio. He was one of the architects of the 1934 Federal Municipal Bankruptcy Act.
        Mr. Scott is survived by his wife, Virginia J. Scott; a daughter, Anne Scott Mitchell of Oklahoma City; two sons, Dr. Robert W. of Jamestown, N.Y., and David W. of Stamford, Conn., and seven grandchildren. His first wife of 49 years, Lucille Westrom Scott, died in 1987.
