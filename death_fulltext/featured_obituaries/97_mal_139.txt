        Michael V. Gazzo, an actor and playwright whose 1955 drama, "A Hatful of Rain," broke theatrical ground in its candid and sympathetic portrayal of drug addiction, died on Feb. 14 at Vencor Hospital in Los Angeles. He was 71 and lived in Los Angeles.
        The cause was complications after a stroke, said his daughter, Peppi.
        Mr. Gazzo, who was also a screenwriter, had a wide and varied career as an actor, ranging from appearances Off Broadway in the postwar years to later roles in movies that included James Toback's "Fingers" (1978) and Francis Ford Coppola's "Godfather, Part II" (1974), for which he received an Oscar nomination.
        But he is still probably best known as the author of "A Hatful of Rain," an unflinching portrait of a young lower-middle-class man struggling to break a narcotics habit.
        The play opened at the Lyceum Theater in 1955 in a production directed by Frank Corsaro and starring Ben Gazzarra, Shelley Winters and Anthony Franciosa. Brooks Atkinson, writing in The New York Times, described it as "a forthright statement of things that are horrifying and true." Mr. Gazzo, he said, had created "pungent dialogue that illuminates human attitudes and a whole segment of city life."
        The play ran for 390 performances and was the basis for a critically praised film in 1957, directed by Fred Zinneman, from a screenplay by Mr. Gazzo and Alfred Hayes, and starring Eva Marie Saint and Don Murray. A television version appeared on ABC in 1967.
        Mr. Gazzo also wrote the play "Night Circus," which opened on Broadway in 1958, and the screenplay for "King Creole' (1958), which starred Elvis Presley.
        In addition to his daughter, who lives in Hoboken, N.J., he is survived by his wife, Grace, of Los Angeles; two sons, Michael and Christopher, both of West Los Angeles; a sister, Anne Lacouette, of Wallkill, N.Y.; a brother, Frank, of Miami, and three grandchildren.
