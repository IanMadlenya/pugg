        H. Wentworth Eldredge, a Dartmouth College sociology professor who in World War II helped divert German attention from plans for the Normandy invasion, died Sunday at Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital in Hanover, N.H. He was 81 years old and lived in Hanover.
        Dr. Eldredge died of pneumonia, said his son James, of Potomac, Md.
        A major in the Army Air Force, Professor Eldredge was attached to the Allies' group of deception planners, those responsible for developing cover plans for the Normandy invasion. In later years he lectured at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and was a consultant to the Central Intelligence Agency and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
        After the war he returned to Dartmouth, and in the late 1960's and early 1970's he was head of the sociology department. He retired in 1974.
        He was the author of several books, including "The Second American Revolution" (William Morrow, 1964), a study of 20th-century politics, and editor of "Taming Megalopolis" (Frederick A. Praeger, 1967) and "World Capitals" (Anchor Press/Doubleday, 1975).
        Born in Brooklyn, he graduated from Dartmouth and received a Ph.D. from Yale University.
        Besides his son James, Professor Eldredge is survived by his wife, the former Diana Joan Younger, and a second son, Alan, of Salem, N.Y.
