        David K. Laniak, the chairman and chief executive of the ACC Corporation, an international telecommunications company, died on Friday at Strong Hospital in Rochester. He was 62.
        Mr. Laniak, a resident of Rush, N.Y., died from a blood clot in his lungs, a spokesman for the company said.
        His death came a little more than a week after ACC agreed to be acquired by Teleport Communications Group Inc. of Staten Island for $1 billion in stock.
        ACC is a local and long-distance telephone service provider in the Eastern United States, Canada, Britain and Germany.
        Mr. Laniak was named chief executive of ACC in October 1995 and appointed chairman a year later. During his tenure, the company bought ACC Telenterprises, its Canadian subsidiary, and U.S. Wats, a long-distance company.
        Mr. Laniak is survived by his wife, Carol, of Rush; two sons, Mark and Todd, of Rochester, and two grandsons.
