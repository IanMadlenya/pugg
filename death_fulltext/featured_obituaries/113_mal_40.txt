        Robert J. Zeller, who retired in 1982 as chairman and chief executive of the  Dollar Savings Bank in the Bronx, died on Tuesday at his daughter's home in Somers, N.Y. He was 79.
        The cause was cancer, said the daughter, Diane J. Zeller.
        Mr. Zeller, who had homes in Bedford Village, N.Y., and on Kiawah Island, S.C., began his banking career at Dollar in 1936, rising to the positions of president in 1974 and chairman in 1980. In 1983, after his retirement, Dollar merged with the Dry Dock Savings Institution in Manhattan to form the Dollar Dry Dock Bank of White Plains, with branches in New York City and Westchester County. Weakened by troubled real estate loans, that bank closed in 1992, and its accounts were acquired by Emigrant Savings Bank of New York City.
        Besides his work at Dollar, Mr. Zeller was a member of the advisory board of  the old Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, a director of the Savings Bank Trust Company and an officer of several industry organizations, including the Savings Bank Association of New York State. A retired Army Reserve officer, he also served as president of the Andrew Freeman Home, as a member of the steering committee for the New York Urban Coalition and as a member of the board of the New York Chamber of Commerce.
        Besides his daughter Diane, Mr. Zeller is survived by his wife, Miriam Dolan  Zeller of Bedford Village and Kiawah Island; another daughter, Barbara Discenza  of Ann Arbor, Mich.; a son, Paul Zeller of Boca Raton, Fla., and four grandchildren.
