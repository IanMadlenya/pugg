        William E. Barlow, a founder and publisher of Spanish and Portuguese-language news magazines distributed in Latin America, died on Tuesday in New York Hospital. Mr. Barlow, who lived in Manhattan, was 76.
        The cause was cancer, said a son, Christopher.
        Mr. Barlow founded Vision Inc. in 1948 and was president of the publishing company, whose magazine Vision covered Latin America, until 1974. He later bought the Media Industry Newsletter and published it until 1991.
        Mr. Barlow is survived by a daughter, Gloria Bernhardt of Nyack, N.Y., and two sons, Christopher of Roanoke, Va., and Jamie of Seattle.
