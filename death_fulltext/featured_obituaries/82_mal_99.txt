        Spencer Henderson 3d, a dancer and choreographer, died on Sunday at his family's home in Fort Worth. He was 44.
        The cause was AIDS, said Harold Fairbanks, a friend.
        Mr. Henderson danced on Broadway in "Promises, Promises" and "Jesus Christ, Superstar" and in the national company of "Zorba." He performed in "Liza" at the Winter Garden and in nightclub acts with Shirley MacLaine, Liza Minnelli and Chita Rivera. He also danced on many television programs, including the "Tonight" Show and "The Merv Griffin Show" as well as a number of awards specials.
        He choreographed the stage show "David Copperfield IV" and the film "Steel Magnolias," and was the assistant choreographer for "Footloose," "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas" and the television series "The Love Boat."
        Mr. Henderson, who was born in Fort Worth, trained in Washington with the National Ballet and in New York at the schools of the Joffrey and Harkness ballet companies. He performed with the Theater Dance Collection in 1971.
        He is survived by his mother and stepfather, Betty and T. A. Avarello.
