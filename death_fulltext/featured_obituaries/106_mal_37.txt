        Harry Nicholas Antoniades, a Harvard biochemist known for his work on growth  factors and the mechanisms of hormone transport, died on Nov. 1 at his home in Newport, Mass. He was 72.
        The cause was cancer, according to the Harvard University School of Public Health, from which he retired in 1993 as professor of biochemistry and senior investigator, and then became a professor emeritus.
        In 1983, Dr. Antoniades established that platelet-derived growth factor, or  PDGF, and the v-sis oncogene, or cancer-causing gene, were essentially the same  molecule. This showed that genes capable of causing cancer were akin to genes regulating cell growth. His finding in effect unified the field of cancer biology, which previously had been divided into the separate studies of viruses  and growth-factor proteins.
        Dr. Antoniades then followed up with studies of oncogenes and growth factor in brain tumors, lung and gastric carcinomas and pulmonary fibrosis, formulating a unifying hypothesis for the molecular pathology of such disorders. In his view certain diseases that shared the property of excessive cell growth, like cancer, also shared a common cause -- the excessive production of growth-promoting factors.
        He was born in Salonika, Greece, and studied at the University of Athens. His association with Harvard dated to 1953, when he joined the university laboratory staff.
        Dr. Antoniades is survived by his wife of 42 years, Maria Tomaras Antoniades; a son, Nicholas, of Annapolis, Md.; a daughter, Anna Lycouris of Greenwich, Conn.; a brother, Demosthenes, of Athens; a sister, Eugenia Manolides of Salonika, and two grandchildren.
