        Willard J. Jacobson, a retired professor of natural sciences at Teachers College at Columbia University, and the author or co-author of more than 5O books, many on the teaching of science, died on Dec. 29 at his home in Duxbury, Mass. He was 78.
        The cause was Parkinson's disease, said his wife, Carol.
        Dr. Jacobson contended in the 1950's that much science education in primary and secondary schools was deficient, and that too few scientists and engineers were being trained. He and Abby B. Bergman were the co-authors of ''Science for Children,'' a textbook for teachers. Other works in which he was involved included the ABC Science Series, for kindergarten through grade six, and the three-book Inquiry Into Science series for junior high school.
        A native of Wisconsin, he received a bachelor's degree in chemistry from the University of Wisconsin and a doctorate in science education from Teachers College.
        Besides his wife, the former Carol Whitaker, he is survived by two daughters, Susan Gaztanaga of Baltimore and Ellen Snoeyenbos of Halifax, Mass.; a son, Thomas, of Takoma Park, Md.; four granddaughters; a brother; and five sisters.
        Correction:  January 17, 2001, Wednesday  An obituary on Jan. 9 about Willard J. Jacobson, a professor of natural sciences at Teachers College, Columbia University, misidentified the type of bomber on which he was a co-pilot in World War II. It was a B-26; the B-52 first flew in 1954.
