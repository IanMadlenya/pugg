        Stuart Troup, a jazz writer, critic and editor who worked for newspapers in the United States and Europe, died on Wednesday at Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla, N.Y. He was 63 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was complications from a kidney transplant, his family said.
        In the 1980's Mr. Troup wrote a weekly column at New York Newsday on nightlife and previewed jazz events while working as features editor.
        He collaborated with the band leader Woody Herman on writing ''The Woodchopper's Ball: The Autobiography of Woody Herman,'' which Mr. Troup completed after Herman's death in 1987.
        Over the years, he also held editing positions at The New York Daily News and The New York Times.
        He is survived by a son, David, of Brooklyn, and a daughter, Laura, of Oakland, Calif.
