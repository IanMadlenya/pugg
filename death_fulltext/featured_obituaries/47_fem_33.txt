        Thelma Stevens, a social worker and retired head of the Women's Division of the United Methodist Church, died yesterday at Brooks Howell, a retirement home in Asheville, N.C. She was 88 years old.
        She died of complications of a stroke, a spokeswoman for the church said.
        As executive secretary of the church's Women's Division, Ms. Stevens was head of social relations work for Methodist women from 1940 to 1968. She was known in religious circles for her work for social justice, international peace and women's rights.
        She was a graduate of Scarritt College and headed the Bethlehem Center, a community center for blacks in Augusta, Ga., from 1928 to 1939. In 1951, she was instrumental in having the Women's Division press for the publication of "States' Laws on Race and Color," a compilation of racial laws.
        There are no immediate survivors.
