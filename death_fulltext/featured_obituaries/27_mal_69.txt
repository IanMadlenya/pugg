        Mr. Doop, the owner of a New Jersey specialty store, married Lillian Montaldo, whom he met while working at a dry-goods store in Joplin, Mo. Together, the couple created the elegant 18th-century French decor used in the Montaldo shops, 12 in all now, in cities across the United States.
        In addition to Montaldo's, Mr. Doop, a native of Cherryvale, Kan., owned and operated Doop's in East Orange, N.J., also a women's specialty shop. He retired in 1985. Lillian Montaldo Doop died in 1980.  Mr. Doop is survived by his second wife, Ruth; a daughter, Barbara Shaw of Manhattan, and a grandson.
