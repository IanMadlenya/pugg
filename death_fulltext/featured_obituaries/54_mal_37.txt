        George Bosque, a Brink's guard who took $1.85 million from an armored truck in 1980 and went on a nationwide spending spree, was found dead Monday, possibly from a drug overdose, the authorities said. He was 36 years old.
        White powder and narcotics paraphernalia were in Mr. Bosque's apartment, where the body was found, Deputy Coroner Don Easterling said.
        Mr. Bosque, who apparently carried out the theft alone, was captured in a supermarket parking lot in San Francisco 15 months after the robbery at San Francisco International Airport on Aug. 15, 1980. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison and was paroled in 1986.
        He said he had spent or given away all the money in a spree in which he lived in penthous suites and rode in limousines, helicopters and cabin cruisers. Stops in the fling included New York City, Denver, Chicago and Florida.
        He said in a prison interview that he had once spent $60,000 to furnish and decorate a $1,160-a-month apartment in Greenwich Village in "opulent Art Deco style."
