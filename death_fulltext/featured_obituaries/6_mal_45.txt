        Henry E. Hasiwar, a onetime organizer of farm workers who became an oil company official, died of cancer of the lung and liver Wednesday at Misericordia Hospital in Philadelphia. He was 70 years old and lived in Yonkers.
        Mr. Hasiwar was born in the Bronx and studied at Columbia University. He was active in the labor movement before he enlisted in the Army and, in 1945-46, was a labor adviser to Japanese unions for the military occupation authorities.
        After his discharge from the military, Mr. Hasiwar moved to the West Coast and became a union organizer for the American Federation of Labor, leading several major strikes in the late 1940's and early 1950's by farm workers in California and Louisiana.
        He returned to the East to join the oil wholesaling business founded by his father, the Ohiolene Oil Company of Yonkers, becoming a vice president.
        He is survived by his wife, Maryse; two sons, Frank of the Bronx and Eugene of Los Angeles; a brother, Frank, of Scarsdale, N.Y., and three granddaughters.
