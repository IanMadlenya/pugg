        Irving Gaynor Neiman, who wrote for radio, television and the stage, died on Sunday at New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 80.
        Mr. Neiman, a graduate of City College, got his big break when he sold a radio script to NBC in the early 1940's. He was drafted into the military shortly afterward, but he continued to write and was one of five servicemen whose work was presented on Broadway in 1943 under the title ''The Army Play by Play.'' Mr. Neiman's contribution was titled ''Button Your Lip'' and featured Myrna Loy in a bit part.
        In later years, Mr. Neiman did a number of adaptations for television, including the James Thurber short story ''The Greatest Man in the World,'' Sophie Treadwell's play ''Machinal'' and the Michel del Castillo novel ''Child of Our Time,'' for which he received a Writers Guild Award.
        No immediate family members survive.
