        Edward Fenton, whose books for young readers included "The Refugee Summer" and "The Phantom of Walkaway Hill," died on Dec. 24 in Athens. He was 78 and had homes in Athens and in Galaxeidion in Greece.
        The cause was cancer, said Jessica Frankel, a spokeswoman for Bantam Doubleday Dell.
        Mr. Fenton was born in New York City and attended Amherst College in Massachusetts. From 1951 to 1955 he was a curator in the prints department of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He moved to Greece in 1963 after marrying Sophia Harvati, a Greek teacher and child psychologist.
        Initially Mr. Fenton wrote poetry, short stories and novels for adults. His adult works include the novel "The Double Darkness" (1947), a thriller set in Greece, and "She Waits" (1974). But the bulk of his work was written for children, beginning with "Us and the Duchess" (1947), about a lost English setter that takes over the life of a family in New York.
        He wrote "Nine Lives: Or, The Celebrated Cat of Beacon Hill" (1951), "The Golden Doors," (1957), "The Nine Questions" (1959), "The Riddle of the Red Whale" (1966) and "Duffy's Rocks" (1974).
        "The Phantom of Walkaway Hill" received an Edgar award from the Mystery Writers of America as the best juvenile book of 1961. "The Refugee Summer," a childhood idyll set against the background of Greece's invasion of Asia Minor in World War I, was nominated for an American Book Award in 1982. He also drew on his knowledge of Greece in "The Morning of the Gods" (1987) and in his translations of works by the Greek writer Alki Zei, including "Petros's War" (1972).
        He is survived by his wife.
