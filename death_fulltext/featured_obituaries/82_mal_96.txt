        Philip A. Fleger, former president and board chairman of the Duquesne Light Company of Pittsburgh, died on Monday at the Bethlen Home in Ligonier, Pa. He was 90 and had lived in Ligonier since retiring in 1968.
        The cause was pneumonia after a lengthy illness, his family said.
        Mr. Fleger was born in Chicago. He graduated from West Virginia University, where he also earned his law degree. He joined the Philadelphia Company, which was then the parent of Duquesne Light, in 1926 as a law clerk and rose to become president by the time the Securities and Exchange Commission split up the company in the 1950's.
        He was then elected chairman and chief executive of Duquesne Light, and the responsibility of president was added in 1958. He retired 10 years later but continued as a member of the board until 1981.
        A leader in the Pittsburgh business community and the electric-utility industry, he also served as a director and president of the Edison Electric Institute, the trade association of investor-owned utilities, in Washington.
        Mr. Fleger is survived by two daughters, Louise Fleger Bishop of Pittsford, N.Y., and Linda Fleger-Berman of Brookline, Mass.; four grandsons, and one great-granddaughter.
