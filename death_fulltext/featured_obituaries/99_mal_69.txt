        Hobart Rowen, an economics and business columnist at The Washington Post whose work was syndicated in other newspapers, died yesterday at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington. He was 76 and lived in Chevy Chase, Md.
        The cause was cancer, a spokesman for The Post said.
        Mr. Rowen was instrumental in building The Post's coverage of national and foreign financial news. He was financial editor of the paper from 1966 to 1975. He became its chief economics correspondent in 1975, the year he began a syndicated column. He received a lifetime achievement award from the Gerald R. Loeb Foundation.
        A native of Burlington, Vt., Mr. Rowen graduated from City College of New York in 1938. By 1941, he had become The Journal of Commerce's Washington correspondent and served in the information division of the Federal War Production Board during World War II.
        He was a columnist for Newsweek before joining The Post in 1966.
        Mr. Rowen is survived by his wife of 53 years, Alice Stadler Rowen; a daughter, Judith Vereker of London; two sons, James, of Milwaukee, and Daniel, of New York, and five grandchildren.
