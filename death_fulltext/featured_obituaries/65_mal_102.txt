        James T. McDermott, a Justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, died on Sunday at his home. He was 65 years old and lived in Chestnut Hill, Pa.
        He died of a heart attack, said Pierre Pie, a family spokesman.
        Justice McDermott was elected to the state's highest court in 1981. In 1990, he won a lower-court libel judgment against The Philadelphia Inquirer. He contended in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas that the newspaper had defamed him when it reprinted a series of articles about the State Supreme Court. Justice McDermott said the articles implied that he could be bribed. The Inquirer is appealing the decision.
        A 1947 graduate of St. Joseph's University, Justice McDermott earned a law degree at Temple University in 1950. He was a partner in the law firm he helped found, McDermott, Quinn & Higgins, from 1950 to 1965 and was active in Republican Party politics.
        His wife, the former Mary Theresa Bradley, died several years ago. He is survived by six children, James McDermott Jr., John B. McDermott, Michael McDermott and Matthew McDermott, all of Philadelphia, Suzanne Cunningham of Morristown, N.J., and Thomas McDermott of Rehoboth, Del.; a sister, Nora Franchetti, of Philadelphia, and eight grandchildren.
