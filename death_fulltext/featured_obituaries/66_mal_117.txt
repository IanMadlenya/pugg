        Anthony Westwater Jong, associate dean of the school of dentistry at Boston University, died at his home in Bolton, Mass., on Wednesday. He was 53 years old.
        Dr. Jong died after a long battle with cancer, said Dorene Dzuiba, a spokeswoman for the university.
        Dr. Jong was a prominent figure in public health dentistry and sought throughout his career to insure that people in low-income neighborhoods had access to regular dental care.
        He was an associate dean of the Henry M. Goldman School of Graduate Dentistry at Boston University and chairman of its department of dental-care management. He had been an assistant dean at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine.
        He was president of the Dimock Community Dental Center in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston and was head of the Child and Youth Project of Boston, which sought to improve health care for Boston youth.
        He is survived by his wife, Patricia; a daughter, Jessica Jong, and a son, Alex Robert Jong, both of Boston; his mother, Lily Fung Jong Chin, and a brother, Allan Jong, both of New York City, and a sister, Cordelia Hwang of California.
