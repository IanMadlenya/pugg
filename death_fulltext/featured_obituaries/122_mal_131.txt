        Wilbur Richard Knorr, a professor at Stanford University who studied the birth of mathematics in antiquity, died on March 18 at the Palo Alto Nursing Center. A resident of Palo Alto, Calif., he was 51.
        The cause was melanoma, a skin cancer, the university said.
        Dr. Knorr, a native of Richmond Hill, Queens, graduated summa cum laude from Harvard University, where he received a master's degree in 1968 and a doctorate in 1973. Joining the Stanford faculty in 1979 as a member of the history of science program, he held a joint appointment as a full professor in the departments of philosophy and classics.
        He focused on classical Greek mathematics and its developments  into the Middle Ages and modernity. He studied the early history of proportion theory, Archimedes, optics and ancient geometrical constructions like circle squaring.
        He learned Arabic to enhance his understanding of early mathematics and placed emphasis on classical geometry from about 400 to 200 B.C. Recently he also worked with medieval astronomical manuscripts.
        He wrote ''The Evolution of Euclidean Elements,'' ''Ancient Sources of the Medieval Tradition of Mechanics,'' ''The Ancient Tradition of Geometric Problems,'' ''Textual Studies in Ancient and Medieval Geometry'' and many articles, essays and reviews for scholarly journals.
        Dr. Knorr is survived by his mother, Dorothy Knorr of Queensbury, N.Y., and a sister, Valerie Maione of Columbia, Md.
