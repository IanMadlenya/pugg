        The Rev. Felix P. Biestek, a retired professor of social work at Loyola University of Chicago, died last Saturday at the university's Jesuit Residence in Chicago. He was 82.
        Father Biestek, a priest for nearly five decades, spent more than 30 years on the Loyola faculty. He also was chairman of the committee on accreditation of the National Commission on Social Work.
        During his tenure at Loyola, he wrote three books on social work. The first, "The Casework Relationship" (Loyola University Press, 1957), was translated into six languages and became the academic equivalent of a best seller, with more than 100,000 copies sold in English alone. Described by the author as "supplemental reading" rather than a primary text, it remains in print.
        The next, "The Five Methods of Social Work" (Malipiero, 1960), appeared only in Italian. The third, a textbook published by Loyola in 1978, was "Client Self-Determination in Social Work."
        Father Biestek was born in Cicero, Ill., and graduated from Loyola University of Chicago in 1938. He earned a master's degree in sociology at St. Louis University and a master's degree and doctorate in social work at Catholic University of America in Washington. He was ordained in 1945.
        He joined the Loyola faculty in 1951 after teaching high school in Cleveland. He retired in the early 1980's but continued to teach at Loyola for several more years.
