        George Biderman, who organized opposition to a plan by Robert Moses for a four-lane highway the length of Fire Island, N.Y., died on July 20 at his home on the West Side of Manhattan. He was 81.
        The cause was throat cancer, his son, John Biderman, said.
        Fire Island, off Long Island, is one of the few American barrier islands without a formal road system. Mr. Biderman, a summer resident there, began doing public relations for the Fire Island Association in 1956. In 1962, after Moses announced his plan, Mr. Biderman led about 3,000 homeowners in lobbying for the Fire Island National Seashore Act, which made parts of the island a national recreation area in 1964 and protected them as wilderness.
        He was also president of the association from 1972 to 1981.
        George Jacob Biderman was born on Aug. 5, 1920, in Paterson, N.J. He attended what was then the City College of New York and the New School for Social Research and did graduate work at the University of Chicago. He served in the Army in World War II.
        He was the director of public relations and marketing at Bantam Books from 1948 to 1952, when he left to start his own public relations firm.
        Mr. Biderman's wife of 54 years, Beth Olds Biderman, also an environmental activist, died last year. She was administrative secretary for the Manhattan Project at the University of Chicago and executive director of the Parks Association of New York.
        In addition to his son John, of Rowley, Mass., Mr. Biderman is survived by his brother, Albert D., of McLean, Va.; his daughter, Tina Vartanian of Les Essarts-le-Roi, France; and two grandchildren.
