        Robert J. Kane, a former president of the United States Olympic Committee and a longtime director of athletics at Cornell University, died yesterday at Tompkins Community Hospital in Ithaca, N.Y. He was 81 years old.
        He died of heart and respiratory failure after a long illness.
        A track athlete at Cornell, Mr. Kane began a long career in college sports administration as assistant athletic director at his alma mater in 1939. He became the director in 1941 and continued in that post until his retirement in 1976.
        Mr. Kane had a long association with the Olympic movement and served as president of the U.S.O.C. from 1977-1981. It was during his tenure that President Carter ordered the United States boycott of the 1980 Summer Games in Moscow.
        Mr. Kane also served two terms as a vice president of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. He was a charter member of the Cornell Athletic Hall of Fame, founded in 1978, and was inducted into the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 1986.
        He is survived by his wife, Ruth Brosmer; a daughter, Karen Nichol, of Freeville, N.Y.; a son, Christopher, of Phoenix; a brother, Thomas J. Kane, of New York; three sisters, Claudine Malone, of Oneida, N.Y.; Kathleen Reynolds, of Palos Verdes Estates, Calif., and Eileen McNamara of Ridgewood, N.J., and six grandchildren.
