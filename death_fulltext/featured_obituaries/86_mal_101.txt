        Dr. Harvey H. Segal, an economics professor and author of a book highly critical of American business, died on Monday at Sloan-Kettering Memorial Hospital. Mr. Segal, who lived in Manhattan, was 71.
        The cause was kidney and bone cancer, said his wife, Eloise.
        Dr. Segal's book "Corporate Make- over: The Reshaping of the American Economy" (1989) cited many tales of managerial waste and abuse. He wrote widely and was a member of the editorial board of The New York Times from 1968 to 1969. From 1971 to 1988 he was a vice president of Citibank.
        Dr. Segal graduated from the University of North Carolina and received a doctorate from Columbia University.
        Dr. Segal is survived by his wife; his son, Harry, of Ithaca, N.Y., and his daughter, Emma Segal of Manhattan.
