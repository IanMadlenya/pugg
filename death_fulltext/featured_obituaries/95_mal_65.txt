        A. Walter Socolow, a lawyer who was a longtime lay leader in the Jewish Reconstructionist movement, died on Dec. 3 at his home in Manhattan. He was 87.
        The cause was heart disease, said his son Robert, of Princeton, N.J.
        He was an early advocate of Reconstructionism, which redefines Judaism not only as a religion, but also as a civilization that includes language, customs and culture. The movement was founded in 1922.
        Mr. Socolow was a founder of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, in Wyncote, Pa. He was also president of the Board of Jewish Education of Greater New York from 1968 to 1971 and president of the Society for the Advancement of Judaism from 1949 to 1952.
        He was born in Manhattan and graduated from City College in 1927. He received a law degree from Harvard University in 1930.
        He is also survived by his wife of 61 years, the former Edith Gutman; a daughter, Joan Bayliss Noparstak of Eugene, Ore.; another son, Daniel, of Atlanta, and five grandchildren.
