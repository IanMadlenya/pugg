        Irving I. Schachtel, former president of the Sonotone Corporation, a manufacturer of hearing aids, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan after a series of strokes. He was 80 years old.
        Mr. Schachtel, who was also president of the American Hearing Aid Association, was especially interested in the hearing problems of children and was the author of ''Conservation of Children's Hearing,'' published in 1948.
        He was born in London and was brought to the United States as a child when his family settled in Buffalo. Mr. Schachtel, a graduate of the University of Buffalo with honors in sociology, earned a law degree from the Columbia University School of Law. He practiced business law for several years and wrote ''Patent Pools and Federal Antitrust Law'' in 1932.
        In 1931 his firm did the legal work when Sonotone was organized, and he became interested in hearing afflictions. A year later he was named secretary of the company, and in 1941 he became a vice president and gave up his law practice. He assumed the presidency in 1946 and retired in 1968.
        After retirement he was a volunteer with the Executive Service Corps and a referee in Family Court in New York City.
        Mr. Schachtel was divorced from his wife, now Elinor Krach. He is survived by two daughters, Ellen, of Manhattan and Mary Wright of Jamestown, R.I.; a son, Roger, of San Francisco; two brothers, John, of Hackensack, N.J., and Maurice, of Manhattan, and a sister, Rosalyn Fishman of Manhattan.
