        Edward William Herold, an inventor in broadcasting technology whose career at the RCA Corporation spanned 42 years, died on Wednesday at his home in Princeton, N.J. He was 85.
        His family said he had been ill for a long time.
        Trained as an electrical engineer, Mr. Herold directed the team that developed the first color television-picture tube and guided RCA's entry into transistors. He retired in 1972 as director of technology at the David Sarnoff Research Center in Princeton, then part of RCA's corporate family.
        A native of Manhattan, he was a Phi Beta Kappa physics graduate of the University of Virginia and earned a master's degree in physics from Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, now Polytechnic University.
        He discovered his technical knack for broadcasting early in life and started a career in the field while he was a teen-ager. After graduation from high school in the 1920's, he worked for a few years for Bell Telephone Laboratories on picture transmission and for E. T. Cunningham on electron tubes.
        Upon college graduation in 1930, he joined the Radio Corporation of America in Harrison, N.J., while taking graduate courses at Polytechnic. He began as a development engineer with a tube research group.
        In 1942 he transferred to the newly formed RCA Laboratories in Princeton as director of the Radio Tube Laboratory and, subsequently directed the Electronics Research Laboratory.
        In the late 1950's, Mr. Herold was in charge of the RCA group that helped Princeton University build a center that performed research in the field of thermonuclear fusion. He left the company for six years to become head of research for Varian Associates of Palo Alto, Calif., returning to RCA in 1965.
        Mr. Herold is survived by a brother, Carl E. of Fort Myers, Fla., and two grandsons.
