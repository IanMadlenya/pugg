        The Rev. Dr. Elam Davies, pastor emeritus of the Fourth Presbyterian Church of Chicago, who helped it build a major church-sponsored community services institution on the city's Near North Side, died Friday in Bethlehem, Pa., where he had retired in the 1980's. He was 86.
        Dr. Davies served from 1961 to 1984 as pastor of the prominent downtown church, which is on Chestnut Street, near busy Michigan Avenue. He started the outreach programs that became the church's Elam Davies Social Service Center, which offers services like mentoring children after school, tai chi classes and geriatric assistance. Begun in the 1960's, it is supported by the church, foundations, individual donations and hundreds of volunteers.
        Elam Davies was born in Grovesend, Wales, and graduated from the University of Wales in 1940 and from Cambridge University in 1942; he received a doctor of divinity degree from Temple University in 1956. He had held two pastorates in Wales before serving as summer pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in Bethlehem in 1952; he stayed on until he was called to the Chicago church in 1961. He also served as interim pastor of the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church in Manhattan, New York City's largest Presbyterian congregation, for several months in 1987.
        He was listed by Time magazine in 1979 as among the country's ''seven star preachers.''
        Dr. Davies is survived by his wife, Grace Owen Davies; a daughter, Judith Schneider of Chicago; and one granddaughter.
