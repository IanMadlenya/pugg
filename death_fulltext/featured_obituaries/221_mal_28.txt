        Roger G. Hall, a former executive for classical music at RCA Victor, died on Monday at his home in Philadelphia. He was 79.
        The cause was complications of Parkinson's disease, said his wife, Katherine Knight Hall.
        As the director of artists and repertory at RCA's Red Seal imprint in the 1960's, Mr. Hall signed deals with some of the leading artists of the day, including the singers Plácido Domingo, Montserrat Caballé, Shirley Verrett and Sherrill Milnes. He also signed recording contracts with André Previn, the Guarneri String Quartet, the pianist Peter Serkin and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.
        And in 1967, in what was considered at the time to be a major coup, he wooed Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra away from Columbia Records.
        Mr. Hall was born in Plainfield, N.J., and graduated from the University of North Carolina. He got his start as a talent promoter at Columbia Artists Management, worked as an assistant manager for the Chicago Symphony, and managed the Philadelphia Orchestra.
        He joined RCA in 1963 and left seven years later to serve as president of the North Carolina School of the Arts Foundation. He returned to artist management in the 1970's, buying out Sol Hurok's contracts after Hurok died in 1974, and brought the Bolshoi Opera and Ballet to the Metropolitan Opera House.
        From 1977 until he retired in 1990, Mr. Hall was an executive at the public radio station WHYY in Philadelphia. He also served for many years on the music advisory panel of the National Endowment for the Arts, and was on the board of the Berkshire Choral Festival in Sheffield, Mass.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Hall is survived by two sons, Roger Barclay, of Los Angeles, and Alexander, of Philadelphia; a daughter, Mary Stockton, of Brooklyn; and two grandchildren.
