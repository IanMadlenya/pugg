        Mr. Webber was involved with new rock in most areas of the music business. He was born in Providence, R.I., managed a record store in Berkeley, Calif., and was a disk jockey for radio stations in Berkeley and Hartford. He helped start Trouser Press, a magazine devoted to British and independent rock, and was its advertising director. In 1977, he started his own independent promotion company, which helped bring such performers as Joan Jett and the Pretenders to mainstream rock radio.
        He joined the New Music Seminar, an annual music-business convention, as executive director in 1980, its second year. He started a record label, Uproar, which recorded a hit dance record by Dominatrix, and in 1986 he began working for Island Records, where he signed the Latin hip-hop singer Noel and released ''The Uproar Tapes,'' an album of performance artists including Karen Finley.
        He is survived by his parents, Helen Webber, of San Francisco, and Dr. Banice Webber, of Providence; a sister, Rachel, of New York; a brother, Daniel, of Hawaii, and a stepsister, Susan Webber, of New York.
