        Morris Edward Kriensky, an artist and writer who helped Gen. Claire Lee Chennault's Flying Tigers bomb their targets with precision in the 1937-45 Sino-Japanese war, died on Feb. 8 at Beth Israel North Hospital in Manhattan. He was 80 and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Kriensky, who was born in Glasgow, studied at the Art Students League of New York and the Escuela de Tecnica in Mexico. He first worked with watercolors and then  turned to oils to produce landscapes and portraits that were widely exhibited.
        He joined the Army Air Force in 1941 and was assigned to General Chennault's command in China, where he was put in charge of a phototechnical unit whose mission was to provide accurate bombing and target information for the 14th Air Force.
        Mr. Kriensky's unit took aerial photographs by the hundreds of thousands, and his task was to keep track of them and identify enemy targets. He carried out further mapping assignments in Japan, Taiwan and Okinawa before returning to civilian life in 1945 with a Bronze Star and the War Memorial Decoration of the Republic of China (Taiwan).
        He was given one-man shows at the Knoedler Gallery in New York; the White House, sponsored by Eleanor Roosevelt; the Frick Art Reference Library, and the Art Institute of Chicago, among others. His paintings are in the permanent collection of the Pushkin Museum in Moscow and were shown in a 15-year retrospective at the University of Connecticut.
        He was the author of ''The Way Is Peace. . . The Road Is Love'' (1973), a volume of drawings, paintings and poems, and ''Visions of Art and Life'' (1976), which also blended paintings and poetry.
        He is survived by a daughter, Shoshana Katz of Mevasseret Zion, a village outside Jerusalem; a sister, Ann Dubrow of Silver Spring, Md.; a brother, Joseph, of Los Angeles, and two grandsons.
