        C. Richard Taylor, a biology professor who studied why prehistoric kangaroos survived the advent of man (it is all in the hop) and why certain antelopes almost never drink, died on Sunday at Emerson Hospital in Concord, Mass. He was 56 and lived in Concord.
        The cause was a heart attack, a family friend said.
        A specialist in animal locomotion, Dr. Taylor was the Charles P. Lyman Professor of Biology at Harvard University and director of the university's field station in Concord. In 1973, he and a colleague, Terrence Dawson, published a study of why, 20,000 to 30,000 years ago, Australian animals like marsupial lions and Tasmanian wolves did not survive the arrival of man and his dog, the dingo, but kangaroos did.
        The scientists theorized that while running animals rapidly burned off their energy, kangaroos actually burned less energy when they hopped than when they walked on all fours. And, so, kangaroos could flee faster, farther and at less cost than the other species. To prove it, the scientists trained kangaroos to wear breathing masks while walking and hopping on a treadmill.
        In the late 1960's, Dr. Taylor studied why two species of antelope in Africa, the eland and the oryx, survive in deserts with barely a drop to drink. They tolerate very high body temperatures, the study showed, slow their metabolic and breathing rates and feed on water-rich shrubs, including one whose leaves are dry during the day but become a third full of water at night.
        A native of Los Angeles, Dr. Taylor earned his bachelor's degree at Occidental College in 1960 and his doctorate at Harvard in 1963.
        He is survived by his wife, Ann, and two children, Gregory and Caitlin, all of Concord; his mother, Rosalind, of Long Beach, Calif., and three brothers, Gregory, of Northridge, Calif., James, of Winthrop, Mass., and John, of Cerritos, Calif.
