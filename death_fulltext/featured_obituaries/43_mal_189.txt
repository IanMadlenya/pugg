        Arthur Rich, a professor of physics at the University of Michigan, died Saturday at his home in Ann Arbor at the age of 52. His family said he died of a brain tumor.
        Professor Rich, a specialist in subatomic particles, was a co-inventor of the positron transmission microscope, a device that uses beams of positrons to produce images of the structure of materials. He also led a group of scientists who developed a positron beam to explore the chemical origins of life.
        At his death he was organizing experiments designed to form anti-hydrogen, the anti-matter twin of hydrogen that now exists only hypothetically.
        A native of Manhattan, Professor Rich was a graduate of Brooklyn College, held a master's degree from Columbia University and a doctorate from Michigan, where he joined the faculty in 1966. He wrote 150 scientific papers on physics and was a Fellow of the American Physical Society.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Paula Schwam; his mother, Auguste Rich of Toledo, Ohio; two daughters, Donna, of Washington, and Marjorie, of Ann Arbor, and a son, Daniel, of Ann Arbor.
