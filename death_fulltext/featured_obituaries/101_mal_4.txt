        Phil L. Burleson, the Dallas lawyer whose legal skills allowed Jack Ruby to carry a presumption of innocence to the grave, died on Monday at Medical City Hospital in Dallas. He was 61.
        His family said he died of a heart attack.
        Millions of Americans watched on television on Nov. 24, 1963, as Jack Ruby,  a Dallas nightclub owner, gunned down President John F. Kennedy's assassin, Lee  Harvey Oswald. The next year, 12 Texas jurors found Mr. Ruby guilty of murder, and he was sentence to death.
        Then Mr. Burleson proved why he was known in Dallas as Mr. Appeals. After Melvin Belli and other celebrated members of the Ruby defense team had faded away, Mr. Burleson stayed on the case, winning a reversal of the conviction on a technicality in 1966. Before a new trial could be held, Mr. Ruby died on Jan. 3, 1967.
        Mr. Burleson's survivors include his second wife, the former Alice Perry; a son, Phil Jr., of Dallas; two daughters, Toni Burleson and Alice Ingram, both of Dallas, and two grandchildren.
