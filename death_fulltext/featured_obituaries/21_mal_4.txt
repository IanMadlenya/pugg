        Miles Smeeton, a yachtsman and conservationist, died of a stroke Wednesday in Calgary, Alberta. He was 83 years old and lived in the Calgary area.
        Mr. Smeeton was born in Hovingham, England, and served as a brigadier in the British Army. After World War II, he took to the seas with his wife, Beryl, sailing a small ketch from Melbourne, Australia, in an attempt to cross the Pacific, round Cape Horn and reach the Atlantic Ocean.
        On the first attempt, they were swamped about 300 miles from Chile. They tried again but were defeated by the sea. Mr. Smeeton concluded, ''once is enough,'' and those words became the title of a book chronicling the voyage. He was the author of eight other books.
        In 1968, the Smeetons moved near Calgary and devoted their energies to breeding endangered wildlife.
        Surviving is a daughter, Clio.
