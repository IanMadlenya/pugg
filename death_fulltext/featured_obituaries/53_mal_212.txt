        Roland Van Zandt, an author and historian who was concerned with the preservation of the Catskills, died on Monday at the Benedictine Hospital in Kingston, N.Y. He was 72 years old and lived in Shandaken, N.Y.
        He died of cancer, said Deborah Allen, co-publisher of the Black Dome Press.
        The Black Dome Press recently issued a special edition of Mr. Van Zandt's first book, "The Catskill Mountain House," on the 25th anniversary of its publication by Rutgers University Press.
        The book is about a famous Greek revival hotel and the early development of the area. Reviewing it in The New York Times in 1967, Henry Christman said the author had "re-created the fascinating history of the upper Catskills to give a large and illuminating view of America's 19th-century cultural, social and economic growth."
        Mr. Van Zandt wrote two other books, "The Metaphysical Foundations of American History" and "Chronicles of the Hudson." He also wrote a play, "Wilson in the Promise Land," which ran briefly on Broadway in 1970, as well as articles and reviews.
        He was the director and then an adviser of the Catskill Center for Conservation and Development.
        A graduate of Rutgers University, he received a master's degree from Harvard University and a Ph.D. in American studies from the University of Minnesota.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Leona Thompson; two daughters, Caroline and Carla, both of New York City; a son, Carter R., of Shandaken, and four brothers, Henry, of Madison, Conn., Harvey, of Morristown, N.J., Richard, of Laguna Beach, Calif., and Harry, of Clifton Knolls, N.Y.
