        Dr. Harrison F. Wood, a physician who did research into rheumatic fever and streptococcal infection, died on Friday at the Hebrew Home and Hospital in West Hartford, Conn. He was 72 years old and lived in West Hartford.
        He died of emphysema, family members said.
        Dr. Wood served seven years in the 1950's as an associate at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York City, where he carried out extensive studies into strep infections.
        At the same time, he held the post of medical director of Irvington House in Irvington, N.Y., a research and treatment center for children with rheumatic diseases. There, in 1957, he reported that clinical studies showed few recurrences of rheumatic fever among children on continuous drug therapy.
        At Irvington House, he participated in a major study that found in 1961 that continuous doses of antibiotics could ward off strep infections and thus prevent rheumatic fever.
        Later, Dr. Wood taught immunology at Yale University Medical School for eight years. He also served on the staff of the Veterans Administration Hospital in West Haven, Conn.
        Born in Chicago, he graduated from the Edgewood School in Greenwich, Conn., New York University and, in 1945, from the university's School of Medicine. He served his internship at Bellevue Hospital.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Nina Duryee, of Norwich, Vt.; two sons, Stephen, of Arlington, Va., and Matthew, of Los Gatos, Calif., and a sister, Frances, of West Hartford.
