        Georges E. Seligmann, a Manhattan dealer who sold works of art to major museums around the world, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 102.
        Dr. Seligmann, who was born and reared in Paris, was trained as a doctor. But just as he was about to set up his own practice, he changed his mind and joined his family's art gallery. His uncles, Jacques and Arnold Seligmann, with his father, Simon, founded a gallery in Paris in 1879. As the business grew, the Seligmann brothers opened branches in London and New York.
        In the 1930's, Dr. Seligmann helped the Louvre acquire David's ''Portrait of Napoleon Bonaparte, First Consul,'' the only painting Napoleon ever sat for. He also sold one of five remaining Ingres portraits, ''Madame Moitessier, Seated,'' to the National Gallery in London.
        In 1940, facing the German invasion of France, Dr. Seligmann moved to New York and joined the Jacques Seligmann Gallery on East 57th Street in Manhattan, which handled a range of art from 18th-century French works to Impressionist and modern paintings. Among the gallery's clients were J. P. Morgan, George Blumenthal, William Randolph Hearst, Lord Rothermere and Sir William Burrell.
        In 1946, Dr. Seligmann married Edna Horn Mandel of Manhattan. In 1949, he opened his own dealership, which prospered until his retirement in 1970.
        Dr. Seligmann's father collected rare medieval works and left them to his son, who in turn gave two rare enamels to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
        He is survived by a stepson, Leon Mandel of Grosse Pointe, Mich.
