        Dr. John Earle Bordley, a Johns Hopkins researcher and educator who worked to improve the treatment of the deaf and hard of hearing, died Monday at his home in Baltimore. He was 90.
        He was professor emeritus of otolaryngology at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, which said the family did not disclose the cause of death.
        Dr. Bordley and a colleague, Dr. William G. Hardy, were among the early advocates of a comprehensive approach to the treatment of hearing and speech impairments. They devised a program to match speech pathology and audiology, the evaluation and rehabilitation of hearing defects, with medical care and screening.
        More than four decades ago, they co-founded the Hearing and Speech Clinic at Johns Hopkins, now known as the division of audiology and speech-language pathology. The university says it was the first service of its kind in the country to be affiliated with a medical center.
        A John E. Bordley Chair in Otolaryngology was endowed at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine three years ago.
        Dr. Bordley was born at Johns Hopkins Hospital, where he would work for 40 years. He graduated from Yale University in 1925 and received his medical degree from Johns Hopkins in 1929. In World War II, he served with the Johns Hopkins unit of the United States Army Medical Corps in the Pacific.
        He reached emeritus status in 1969. Three years later, Boys Town in Omaha, a center for disadvantaged youths, asked his help in establishing what became Boys Town National Institute for Communicative Disorders in Children. Its library bears his name.
        Dr. Bordley is survived by his wife of 63 years, Ellen Fisher Bordley; two daughters, Ellen Bruce Gibbs and Anne Moss; three granddaughters, and three great-grandchildren.
