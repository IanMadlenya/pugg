        Robert F. Brozman, a business executive whose companies included La Petite Academy, a chain of child-care centers, died Monday at St Luke's Hospital. He was 70 years old and lived in Mission Hills, Kan.
        Mr. Brozman founded the Century Acceptance Corporation in 1948. The company eventually grew into three businesses: Cen-Cor, Concorde Career Colleges and La Petite Academy. They deal in child care, postsecondary training, consumer finance, temporary employment and equipment leasing.
        La Petite is the nation's second-largest child-care chain, with 750 centers in 33 states.
        Mr. Brozman is survived by his wife, Lori; a son; three daughters, and five grandchildren.
