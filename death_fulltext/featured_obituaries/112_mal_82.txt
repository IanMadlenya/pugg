        Howard Aaron Shapiro, who chronicled his four-year battle with AIDS through a series of newspaper and magazine articles, died of its complications on Saturday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. He was 40.
        The lifelong New Yorker took up the pen when he discovered he was infected with the virus, writing humorous magazine columns that shed light on his life with the disease and his attempts to fight the system for the assistance he needed to survive.
        His first article, "How Does It Feel When a Jewish Kvetch Gets H.I.V.," was  published in the weekly New York Press, and he began to write monthly columns for the gay publication Body Positive in December 1993. His last column, written in the hospital, is to appear in Body Positive.
        His work was also pubished in The Village Voice and gay publications throughout the country.
        Mr. Shapiro is survived by his mother, Miriam Cooper of Manhattan; his father, Paul Shapiro of Scottsdale, Ariz.; a sister, Leslie Greenberg of Rockville Centre, L.I., and grandmother, Shirley Shapiro of Miami.
