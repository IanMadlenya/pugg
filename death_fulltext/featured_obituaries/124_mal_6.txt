        Howard E. Simmons Jr., the former head of research and development at E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, died on April 26 at his home in Greenville, Del. He was 67.
        The cause of death was congestive heart failure, his wife, Elizabeth, said.
        Mr. Simmons joined Du Pont as a research chemist in 1954, and remained with the company until he retired in 1991 as vice president and director of central research and development. Early in his career, Mr. Simmons did research in organic chemistry, and in 1956 he and another researcher, R. D. Smith, developed a chemical reaction involving a basic organic structure called cyclopropane. He also worked with Jean-Marie Lehn, a Nobel laureate, on crown ethers, which were precursors to synthetic enzymes.
        Beginning in the late 1970's, Mr. Simmons guided the company's expansion in research in life sciences like biotechnology and genetics, and in imaging and electronics.
        He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He also held visiting professorships at Harvard University, the University of Chicago and the University of Delaware.
        Mr. Simmons received a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1951 and a doctorate in organic chemistry in 1954. He started at Du Pont that year. He was promoted to research supervisor in 1959, and served as associate director and then research director in the reserch department, before becoming director of central research and development in 1979. He was named vice president of central research in 1983, and named as the senior science adviser to the chairman of the company in 1990.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Simmons is survived by two sons, both of whom are staff research chemists at Du Pont, Howard E. Simmons 3d and John W. Simmons, also of Wilmington, and three grandchildren.
