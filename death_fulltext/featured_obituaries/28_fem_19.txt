        Alice-Leone Moats, a journalist who was the author of nine books, died Sunday at Graduate Hospital, Philadelphia, after a long illness. She was 81 years old and lived in Philadelphia.
        Miss Moats was a foreign correspondent for Collier's magazine in Japan, China and the Soviet Union, among other countries, before becoming a columnist for The Philadelphia Inquirer.
        Born in Mexico of wealthy and socially prominent American parents, she was educated at convent schools in Mexico City, Rome and Paris, at the Brearley School in Manhattan and the Fermata School for Girls in Aiken, N.C.
        In 1933 she wrote ''No Nice Girl Swears'' (St. Martin's Press), a sassy book of etiquette that immediately became a best seller. It took years of foreign correspondence and the publishing in 1943 of her favorite book, ''Blind Date with Mars,'' (Doubleday Doran) about a journey through the Far East, before the furor cooled off.
        In a 1984 interview, Miss Moats, who never married although she said she had been engaged eight times, noted that society had changed. Instead of pretty debutantes, she said, society had become what she called ''the Face Lift Brigade.''
        ''I'm glad I had money when I was young and pretty,'' she said.
        There are no immediate survivors.
