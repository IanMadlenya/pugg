        Peter A. Pender, one of the world's leading bridge players, died Sunday night in San Francisco. He was 54 years old.
        He died of complications from AIDS, his lawyer, Roger Sleight, said.
        Mr. Pender and his bridge partner, Hugh Ross of Oakland, Calif., were important members of a California foursome that was highly successful in the past decade. The team won a string of national titles and one world championship, the Bermuda Bowl, in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in 1985. There they barely defeated Brazil in the semifinal but easily defeated Austria in the final. A year ago the foursome formed the nucleus of a United States team that finished second to Brazil in the Bermuda Bowl in Perth, Australia.
        Mr. Pender won many national titles and the McKenney Trophy in 1966, awarded for the best overall performance in a calendar year. He was also coach of several national teams, a commentator at world championships and a member of appeals committees.
        Mr. Pender, a native of Philadelphia, attended Harvard University and was a successful competitive skater. For many years he owned and managed a resort in Forestville, Calif.
        He had no immediate survivors.
