        Frank N. Bowers, president of the International Freighting Corporation for 18 years before the shipping line discontinued operations in 1957, died on Thursday at his home in Juno Beach, Fla. He was 95 years old and lived in Short Hills, N.J., before he retired to Tequesta, Fla., in the 1960's.
        Mr. Bowers joined the I.F.C. Steamship Line, as the corporation was also known, in 1922. He was traffic manager when the line was acquired by E. I. du Pont de Nemours in 1929, and he rose to become president in 1940. In 1957 he was named a vice president of Moore-McCormack Lines, where he remained for six years.
        Mr. Bowers was a past chairman of the American Committee of Lloyds Register of Shipping.
        His wife, the former Dorothy Skene, died in 1987. He is survived by two daughters, Betty Twombly of Short Hills, N.J., and Sherry Wolfe of Edgewater, N.J., and a son, James, of Yardley, Pa.
