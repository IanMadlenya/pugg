        Michael Westphal, a former Davis Cup tennis player for Germany, died Thursday night at the Eppendorfer University Clinic. His death was a result of a virus he had suffered from for two years, officials at the hospital said. He was 26 years old.
        From 1982 to 1986, Mr. Westphal competed for West Germany in 11 Davis Cup matches. He became a national hero after an epic five-hour victory over Tomas Smid in a Davis Cup match against Czechoslovakia in 1985. Mr. Westphal's highest world ranking was 46th in March 1986.
        In 1989, Mr. Westphal was stricken by the virus. Then, heavy medication caused an irregular heartbeat and his tennis career ended. His condition had improved in the last year, but two weeks ago, he had a relapse and was admitted to the hospital.
