        C. Lane Fortinberry, a media consultant and former executive at Time Inc. and The New York Times, died last Wednesday at his home in New Canaan, Conn. He was 73.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Steve Ellwanger, a friend.
        Mr. Fortinberry retired in 1976 as publisher of Life magazine's international editions. He previously sold advertising for The Times and later became European manager of the international edition in Amsterdam.
        In 1976, he and James A. Linen formed Linen-Fortinberry Associates. At his death he was a consultant to Media Post Communications.
        He was a native of Monticello, Miss., and a business graduate of Northwestern University.
        He is survived by two daughters, Alicia Lane Fortinberry of Raleigh, N.C., and Diana Lane Fortinberry of New Canaan.
