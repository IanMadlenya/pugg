        William Myers, a versatile supporting actor seen on and off Broadway, died on Wednesday at Beth Israel Medical Center. He was 74 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was pneumonia, said Robert Rodriguez, a friend.
        A native of Altoona, Pa., Mr. Myers was a drama graduate of the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh and studied acting technique with Uta Hagen in New York.
        He made his New York debut in Strindberg's play "The Father." His last Broadway appearance was in Brian Friel's "Faith Healer," in 1979, but he continued to act off Broadway and out of town.
        A highlight of his career came in 1961 when he replaced Morris Carnovsky as the Magician in Ionesco's "Rhinoceros." His television credits include "The U.S. Steel Hour," "Naked City" and "Sergeant Bilko."
        Mr. Myers is survived by a brother, Donald, also of Manhattan.
