        Dr. Irwin Philip Sobel, a pediatrician and novelist, died yesterday at St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx. He was 89 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of prostate cancer, said his son, Michael.
        Dr. Sobel was affiliated with Lenox Hill Hospital for six decades and was head of its pediatrics department from 1962 to 1967. In that time he helped invent a three-way valve that sharply reduced the time required for a transfusion to exchange the blood of a newborn infant.
        He was also chief of pediatrics at the Lenox Hill School for the Deaf for 25 years. He retired in 1981.
        Dr. Sobel was the author of two novels, "The Hospital Makers," published in 1972, and "The Virus Killer" (1975), both of which dealt in an irreverent manner with goings-on in a supposedly fictitious metropolitan hospital.
        He was born in Manhattan and was a graduate of Columbia College and of Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons. In World War II, as a lieutenant colonel in the Army Medical Corps, he was chief of medicine at the 112th General Hospital in England.
        Dr. Sobel's only immediate survivor is his son, who lives in Manhattan.
