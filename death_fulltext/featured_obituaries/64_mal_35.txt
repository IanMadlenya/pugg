        Daniel E. Woods, an internationally known archeologist who taught at Manhattanville College in Purchase, N.Y., for many years, died in Nashville at the home of his daughter on May 6. He was 87 years old.
        His daughter, Sigourney Cheek, said he died after a brief illness.
        Professor Woods led the way in the late 1940's and early 1950's in building international interest in unearthing the sites of Roman settlements in Spain. He secured financing through the William L. Bryant Foundation, which he was instrumental in organizing, and drew international teams of archeologists to sites throughout Spain, including Tarragona, now a national monument, the Balearic Islands, and the island of Majorca, that soon became recognized as important sources of information about the Roman Empire.
        Professor Woods, who earned degrees from Holy Cross College, Columbia University, and did further study at the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University, headed the Department of Classics and Archeology at Manhattanville College from 1959 to 1980 and inspired numerous students there to pursue degrees in the field. He also taught at New York University and Rollins College during his career.
        His wife, Carmella LeClair Woods, died in 1990. He is survived by his children, Mrs. Cheek, of Nashville, and a son, J. Kevin, of Madrid, and five grandsons.
