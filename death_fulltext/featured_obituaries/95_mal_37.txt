        Kenny Kneitel, a graphic designer who produced logos and signs for paperbacks, stores and restaurants, died on Nov. 30 at his home in the Chelsea section of Manhattan. He was 52.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Kneitel's designs were known for their wit and elegance. Among the restaurants that carry them are the Odeon, Cafe Luxembourg, Caffe Bianco, Arcadia, Metropole, Zig-Zag, Lucky Strike, Bar Six, the Viceroy, the Roxy and Gray's Papaya.
        He created logos for the NBC show "Saturday Night Live" and the production company Broadway Video. He also designed the paperback best-seller "Saturday Night Live" (Avon, 1977) and "The Great American T-Shirt" (New American Library, 1976).
        He is survived by his wife, Polly Dufresne; his mother, Ruth F. Kneitel of Manhattan; a sister, Virginia A. Mahoney of Chevy Chase, Md., and a brother, Thomas S. of Long Island.
