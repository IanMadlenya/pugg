        Jean-Rene Guerrand, patriarch of the family that owns the Paris-Based Hermes Group, died at his country home near Le Havre in Normandy last Friday. He was 89.
        His nephew, Jean-Louis Dumas, chairman of the fashion company, announced his death yesterday.
        Mr. Guerrand joined Hermes in 1926 and remained with the company for 64 years until his retirement in 1990. He was managing director and vice chairman of the Hermes Group and chief executive officer of Hermes Perfumes.
        He established the company's worldwide export division.
        Hermes was founded in 1837 by Thierry Hermes as a maker of harnesses and saddles. Mr. Guerrand was the fourth generation of the family, the son-in-law of Emile Hermes, who was the grandson of the founder.
        Mr. Guerrand is survived by his wife, Aline; a daughter, Myrian Siegrist of Paris; and four sons: Xavier of New York and Patrick, Hubert and Jerome of Paris.
