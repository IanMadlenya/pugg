        George Robert Carley, a retired advertising and marketing executive, died last Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 80.
        He had had a brief illness, his family said.
        A native of Port Jervis, N.Y., Mr. Carley graduated in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1934.
        In 1953 he joined Fitzgerald Advertising Inc. in New Orleans. He was in charge of the Wesson Oil, later Hunt Foods-Wesson, account and served as the company's president until he returned to New York in the early 1960's.
        He then worked for Young & Rubicam and finally, until 1966, as corporate vice president of Seeman Brothers and vice president-marketing at its Seabrook Farms subsidiary.
        Mr. Carley's wife of 21 years, Reva Urban, a painter and sculptor, died in 1987. He is survived by two daughters, Shelly Pearlman of Cambridge, Mass., and Viviane Bennett of Greenwich, Conn.; three sons, Michael, of Vanier, Ont., Stephen, of Charlotte, N.C., and Robert Jr., of Greenwich, Conn., and seven grandchildren.
