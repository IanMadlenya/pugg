        Andrew M. McBurney, a retired executive vice president of the Oxford Paper Company and a former official of the Office of Price Stabilization in Washington, died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 77 years old and also lived in Lake Placid, N.Y.
        He died of heart failure brought on by emphysema, his family said.
        Mr. McBurney, a native of Philadelphia and a graduate of the Hill School and Yale University, joined Oxford in 1936 in Rumford, Me., and moved to the New York office two years later.
        After service as a Marine captain in the Pacific in World War II, he returned to Oxford and became executive vice president in charge of sales and operations in 1966. In 1951 and 1952 he took a leave to serve as chief of the pulp, paper and paperboard branch of the Forest Products Division of the Office of Price Stabilization. In 1968 he was appointed a member of the President's Office of Emergency Preparedness.
        When Oxford was merged into the Ethyl Corporation in 1967, Mr. McBurney became a director of Ethyl, a post he held until 1989. In 1976 Oxford was sold to Boise Cascade and he continued as an adviser to that company's paper-products division. He was chairman of the Printing Paper Maufacturers Association in 1962 and 1963.
        Mr. McBurney is survived by his wife, the former Lidie Sloan; two sons, A. Sloan McBurney of Dorset, Vt., and F. Lane McBurney of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
