        Milton J. Greenebaum, former president of Kirby, Block & Company, a cooperative buying service for department stores, died on Wednesday at Lenox Hill Hospital. He was 98 and lived in Manhattan.
        Sixty years ago Mr. Greenebaum helped organize P. A. Bergner's in Peoria, Ill., which became a national department store chain. He remained a member of the board of directors until two years ago when the chain declared bankruptcy. It was recently acquired by Carson, Pirie, Scott & Company, a department store holding company.
        As president of the buying cooperative, Mr. Greenebaum was in the forefront of developments in women's apparel and was frequently quoted by national newspapers and magazines on trends in retailing and consumer manufacturing.
        In 1955, Mr. Greenebaum was awarded the French Legion of Honor with the rank of Chevalier in recognition of his work in revitalizing the French economy during reconstruction after World War II. In 1959 Italy honored him with the decoration of Knight of the Order of Merit for his charitable efforts in rebuilding its economy after the war.
        A native of Philadelphia, Mr. Greenebaum was graduated from the University of Pennsylvania.
        He is survived by his daughter, Aline Greenebaum Marmon of White Plains; three grandsons and five great-grandchildren.
