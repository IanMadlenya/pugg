        Charles Lee Austin, former president and vice chairman of the old Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation of Pittsburgh, died Wednesday at the Mayflower Place nursing home in West Yarmouth, Mass. He was 89 years old.
        Mr. Austin, a native of Port Chester, N.Y., graduated from Princeton University in 1924 and was an executive at several companies before joining J. & L. as treasurer and a director in 1942.
        He became executive vice president of the steelmaker, then one of the country's largest, in 1948 and was elected president four years later. Within weeks, the company and the rest of the steel industry underwent one of its worst crises, in a wage-price dispute with its labor force and the Government.
        President Harry S. Truman, citing military requirements for steel, ordered the seizure of the industry in early May. The Supreme Court voided the order in June, and 600,000 steelworkers went on strike. A settlement on wage and price increases was not reached until July.
        Mr. Austin became vice chairman of J. & L. in 1956 and retired the next year. He then served for three years as a steel consultant to the World Bank.
        J. & L. combined with the Republic Steel Corporation in 1984 to form the LTV Steel Company of Cleveland, part of the LTV Corporation of Dallas.
        Mr. Austin is survived by his wife of nearly 64 years, the former Louise Bradley Wilson; two sons, Charles Lee Austin Jr. of Manhattan and John Bradbury Austin of Evanston, Ill., and one granddaughter.
