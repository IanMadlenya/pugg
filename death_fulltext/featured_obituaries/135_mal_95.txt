        Robert Joseph Tramonte, a Brooklyn bookseller whose shops were popular gathering places for writers as well as readers, died on April 9 at his home in Amherst, Mass. He was 52.
        The cause was heart failure, said his wife, Barbara.
        Mr. Tramonte owned Cousin Arthur's Books for Children, a shop in Brooklyn Heights, from 1983 to 1992. The shop was the scene of many readings and author autograph sessions and became a popular haunt for local writers like Norman Rosten, Donald Lev and Enid Dame. Mr. Tramonte also owned another Brooklyn bookshop, Our Mutual Friend.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Rachel, of Boston; a son, David, of Amherst; his father, Anthony, of Tamarac, Fla.; two brothers, Anthony, of Wantagh, N.Y., and Michael, of Bayside, Queens, and a sister, Cathy Grace, of Brooklyn.
