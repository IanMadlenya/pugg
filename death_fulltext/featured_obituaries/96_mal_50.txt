        Ted Hawkins, a country and blues songwriter, singer and guitarist known for his piercing songs of sorrow and joy, died on Dec. 29 at the Centinela Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was 58 and lived in Los Angeles.
        The cause was a stroke, said his manager, Nancy Meyer.
        Last year, Mr. Hawkins graduated from playing in the streets of Los Angeles to performing in clubs around the world after his sixth solo record, "The Next Hundred Years," was released by DGC Records to critical acclaim. It was his first record on a major label.
        Mr. Hawkins was born in Lakeshore, Miss., the son of a prostitute and a man he never knew. His passion for music was kindled when he was 12 and in reform school, during a visit from the New Orleans pianist Professor Longhair. In the following years, Mr. Hawkins moved around the country by sneaking onto freight trains, he said, and served time in various prisons for burglary and other offenses.
        In 1966 he moved to Los Angeles, where he recorded a single on the Money label. He made his first solo album in 1971, but it was not released until 1982. In the meantime, he made money in the streets performing on a milk crate, an item that became as indispensable to Mr. Hawkins as his Martin guitar. He was still sitting atop a milk crate in his last New York performance, in October at the Church of St. Anne and the Holy Trinity in Brooklyn.
        In the late 1980's Mr. Hawkins lived in England, where his four records from the early 80's had earned him a small following. He recorded his fifth album, "I Love You Too," there in 1989, and the BBC radio sessions he taped at the time are scheduled to be released by Strange Fruit in February.
        He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth; four daughters, Elizabeth, Tina, Carmen and Adrienne, and a son, Theodore.
