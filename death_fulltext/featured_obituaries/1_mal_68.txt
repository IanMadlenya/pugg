        Charles C. Wei, a shipping executive and a leading figure in contract bridge, died in New York Hospital yesterday from complications resulting from diabetes. He was 72 years old and had homes in Manhattan and Houston.
        In 1964 Mr. Wei devised the Precision Club System of bidding, which eventually became by far the most popular of the specialized methods used in tournament play. In 1969 he was the nonplaying captain of the Taiwan team that, using his system, upset the United States en route to the final of the World Team Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
        Mr. Wei succeeded in persuading many top-ranked players to play his system, refine it and write about it. A ''Precision Team'' of young Americans won three major national titles in 1971 and 1972, and two great Italian players, Benito Garozzo and Giorgio Belladonna, used their ''Super Precision'' system to help Italy win world team titles in 1973, 1974 and 1975. Since then Precision has been played in every world championship.
        Early in his business career, Mr. Wei operated several major foreign-flag fleets. For the last 20 years he has headed the Falcon Shipping Group, which has built and operated 13 bulk carriers, one of the largest such fleets flying the United States flag.
        He is survived by his wife, Kathie, a world titlist in bridge; a son, Larry, of Coudersport, Pa.; a daughter, Andrea, of Manhattan, and three stepchildren, Larry Shen of Dayton, Ohio, Ada Shen Jaffe of Seattle and Ava Shen Casey of Houston.
