        Ulf Bjorlin, a Swedish composer and conductor, died on Oct. 23 at the Good Samaritan Hospital in West Palm Beach, Fla. He was 60 years old and lived in Palm Beach.
        The cause was leukemia, said Herb Schapiro, who wrote the drama on which Mr. Bjorlin based his "Musical Portrait of Raoul Wallenberg."
        Before coming to the United States in 1977, he was music director of the Royal Dramatic Theater in Stockholm, appointed by Ingmar Bergman. He wrote the music for several Swedish plays and films.
        He was a guest conductor with many orchestras, including the London Symphony and the Philadelphia Orchestra. Most recently he was the music director and conductor of the Greater Palm Beach Symphony and the Florida Festival Philharmonic. He recorded several albums for the E.M.I. label.
        He is survived by his wife, Fary; three daughters: Nadia, of Palm Beach, Katja Salen of Stockholm, and Kamilla Pariser of Marblehead, Mass.; three sons: Ulf Jr. and Jean-Paul, both of Palm Beach, and Kaj, of Stockholm; two brothers, and two grandchildren.
