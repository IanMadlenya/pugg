        Michel-Melthon Lynch, a bass player and drummer for the Haitian band Boukman Eksperyans, died on June 4 at his home in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. He was 25.
        The cause was meningitis, said his manager, Dan Behrman.
        Mr. Lynch, also known by the nickname Olicha, the name of a voodoo spirit, was born in Port-au-Prince. He began playing the drums in high school. In 1988 he helped found the band Kaladja, which played roots music, a contemporary Haitian style characterized by its adherence to the country's rural traditions instead of to the mainstream compa music of the city.
        In 1991, Mr. Lynch joined Boukman Eksperyans, a roots-music group named for the leader of a slave uprising. He distinguished himself with vigorous, dynamic drumming and bass playing, and also played keyboards. The group, said to be the first Haitian band to release a record on a major American label (Mango/Island), mixes voodoo polyrhythms and Western rock. The band has made summer tours in the United States since 1990.
        A number of Boukman Eksperyans's songs have been banned from radio, television and public performance in Haiti because their lyrics were interpreted as supportive of democracy and critical of the present military regime.
        He is survived by his mother, Carole De Lynch, and a sister, Diana, both of Port-au-Prince.
