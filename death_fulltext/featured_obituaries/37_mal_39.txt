        Anthony R. Derham, a former head of the Japan Society Gallery and a former director of oriental art at Christie's, died on Saturday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. He was 46 years old.
        Mr. Derham died of pulmonary complications, his brother, John T. Derham, said.
        Mr. Derham was an authority on Oriental art who worked for galleries and auction houses in England, where he was educated, and in the United States. In London, he was an assistant auctioneer with Christie's from 1963 to 1975, before spending two years as a partner with Eskenazi Ltd., an art dealer.
        Mr. Derham returned to Christie's in 1977 to help open the firm's New York branch. He was its director of Oriental art until 1986, when he became head of the Japan Society Gallery. During his three years with the gallery, he organized exhibitions that included ''Court and Samurai in an Age of Transition'' and ''Medieval Paintings and Blades From the Gotoh Museum.''
        In addition to his brother, who lives in Wilmslow, England, Mr. Derham is survived by his mother, Guita Derham, of London, and his sister, Sacha Pickard, of West Sussex, England.
