He was declared dead at Southampton General Hospital, a spokesman, Andrew Clapper, said.
        In 1974, when he was a Member of Parliament whose business ventures were failing, Mr. Stonehouse went to Florida and faked his death by leaving his clothes on a beach and disappearing. He was arrested two months later in Australia, where he was living under a false name, and was then extradited to Britain and tried on 21 charges of theft, fraud and deception involving more than $382,500.
        He was convicted in 1976 and sentenced to seven years, serving three before being released on parole.
        While in prison, Mr. Stonehouse suffered three heart attacks and underwent open heart surgery. He also was divorced from his first wife, Barbara. In 1981, he married his secretary, Sheila Buckley.
        Mr. Stonehouse was a Member of Parliament for the Labor Party from 1957 to 1974. He served in a Labor Cabinet from 1967 to 1970 as Aviation Minister, Minister of State for Technology, Postmaster General and then Minister of Posts and Telecommunications. He wrote three novels, all thrillers. He is survived by his wife, three children from his first marriage and a son from his second marriage.
