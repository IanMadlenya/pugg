        Herminio Traviesas, an NBC censor between 1969 and 1979, died Friday in the John F. Kennedy Hospital in Atlantis, Fla. He was 79.
        The cause of death was a stroke, said a friend, William Mehlich.
        Mr. Traviesas was named NBC's vice president of broadcast standards in 1969 and for the following decade was prominent in establishing industry standards of acceptability for advertising and programming. He retired to Atlantis in 1979.
        He is survived by his wife, Florence, and a sister, Lilia Newsom of Old Saybrook, Conn.
