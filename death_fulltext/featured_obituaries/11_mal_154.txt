        Hob Broun, a writer, died of asphyxiation Dec. 16 when his respirator broke down in his home in Portland, Ore. He was 37 years old.
        Seven years ago, Mr. Broun underwent surgery to remove a spinal tumor, resulting in paralysis. He was dependent on a respirator, which, along with an alarm system, failed.
        Mr. Broun wrote two books by expelling air through a catheter that activated the keyboard of a computer. In this way, he wrote a novel, ''Inner Tube,'' and a collection of short stories, to be published in May. The publisher of both books, along with his first novel, ''Odditorium,'' is Alfred A. Knopf.
        Mr. Broun was born in Manhattan and graduated from the Dalton School. He attended Reed College in Portland. He is survived by his father, Heywood Hale Broun, the writer and broadcaster, and his mother, Jane Broun, of Woodstock, N.Y, and Manhattan.

        Mr. Broun died of complications from a spinal tumor on Dec. 15. His paralysis dated not from 1980 but from 1983, when he underwent surgery on the tumor. The obituary also misidentified the publisher of his first novel, ''Odditorium''; it was Harper & Row.
