        Alfred Isselbacher, an art dealer who specialized in 19th- and 20th-century prints, died on Feb. 15at a hospital in the Bronx. He was 73 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Isselbacher was born in Isselbach, Germany, in 1926. His family emigrated to the United States in 1938 and settled in Manhattan. After graduating from high school, he served in the United States Coast Guard during World War II.
        After the war, Mr. Isselbacher worked at different jobs until the late 1950's, when he opened a stationery and bookstore in the Inwood section of Manhattan. He gradually began to sell prints at his shop, starting with a lithograph by Ossip Zadkin.
        Mr. Isselbacher opened a gallery  at 1225 Madison Avenue in 1965, moving in 1970 to 1223 Madison Avenue and in 1980 to 41 East 78th Street. Although he exhibited paintings, drawings and sculpture, prints remained his main focus. Over the years he had exhibitions of prints by Matisse, Picasso, Bonnard, Dubuffet, Miro, Escher and Frank Stella. He closed the gallery in 1996.
        He was an active member of the Art Dealers Association of America, serving on its board of directors and exhibiting in its annual Art Show at the Seventh Regiment Armory from its inception in 1989 until 1998.
        He is survived by his wife, Carmen; a daughter, Audrey Liebman; and two grandchildren, all of Manhattan.
