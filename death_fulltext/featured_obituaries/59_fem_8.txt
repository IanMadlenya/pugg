        Greta Kempton, a painter whose portrait of President Harry S. Truman hangs in the White House, died on Monday at her home in New York City. She was 89 years old.
        She died of heart failure, said her daughter, Daisy Dickson of Norfolk, Va.
        Miss Kempton, who was born in Vienna, started painting life-size portraits while still a child. She studied art in Vienna and, after her family moved to the United States in the early 1920's, at the National Academy of Design and the Art Students League in New York City. By the mid-1930's, she was living in California and was well-established as a painter of commissioned portraits, with Hollywood studio heads like Louis B. Mayer and Adolf Zukor among her clients.
        In the 1940's she painted portraits of several members of the Truman Administration and their families, which led to commissions for portraits of the President, his wife and daughter.
        Miss Kempton's husband, A. M. McNamara, a lawyer and business executive, died several years ago.
