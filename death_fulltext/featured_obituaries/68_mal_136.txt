        Dennis Thim, the European editor and correspondent of Women's Wear Daily and the fashion magazines W and M, died on Wednesday at a hospital in Paris. He was 33 years old and lived in Paris.
        He died of AIDS-related causes, the publisher of the three periodicals, Fairchild Publications, reported at its New York headquarters.
        A native of Valley Stream, L.I., Mr. Thim joined the Paris bureau of Fairchild Publications as an advertising representative in 1984. He transferred to the editorial department three years later when he was named European editor of Women's Wear Daily, W and M.
        Last year, when W Europe was started, he was given the added responsibility of being its first executive editor. Reporting on the Paris scene in the fashion publications, Mr. Thim wrote under the pen name of Louise J. Esterhazy.
        Mr. Thim is survived by his companion, Franco Ferracci of Paris; his parents, William and Eileen Thim of Lebanon, N.H.; three sisters, Margaret of Princeton, N.J., Kathy Valvo of Durham, N.H., and Maureen DaCosta of New Mexico, and a brother, Kevin of Long Beach, N.J.
