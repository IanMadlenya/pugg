        Anselm Talalay, an inventor and retired vice president of research and development at the B.F. Goodrich Industrial Products Division in Akron, Ohio., died on Thursday at his home in Cleveland. He was 82.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Talalay was born in Russia, and after the Revolution of 1917 was taken West by his family to live in Germany, Belgium and England. He received a degree in physics from Technical University in Berlin and worked in London before coming to the United states in 1939.
        He joined the Sponge Rubber Products Company in Shelton, Conn., and rose to general manager before becoming a vice president of B. F. Goodrich in 1966. His early work as an inventor dealt chiefly foam-rubber products, but he also held patents on products like synthetic leather, rubber, plastics and a compound for cleaning closed water systems.
        In World War II, he and his father, Joseph, and a brother, Leon, collaborated to develop a new process for producing latex foam rubber. Among them, the Talalays held about 50 patents in the United States and abroad.
        Mr. Talalay is survived by his wife of 50 years, Marjorie; three daughters, Nina, of Boston, Lauren, of Ann Arbor, Mich., and Kathryn, of New York City; a brother, Paul, of Baltimore; and a sister, Dorothy Cullman of New York City.
