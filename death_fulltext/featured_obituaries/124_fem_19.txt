        Thelma Biracree Schnepel, who danced with Martha Graham in 1926 in her first concert, died on May 12 at the Harborside Health Care center in Fort Wayne, Ind. She was 93 and lived in Fort Wayne.
        Known professionally by her maiden name, Miss Biracree danced early in her career with the Eastman Theater Ballet in Rochester, where she grew up. She also performed in Paris before becoming a member of Graham's first company, which consisted of the choreographer and a trio of young women. Miss Biracree continued as an assistant to Graham for several years.
        In 1931 she created an evening of ballets to music by American composers for the first Festival of American Music in Rochester, and choreographed and danced for the festival for the next two decades. Miss Biracree also provided dances and performers for productions by the Eastman School Opera Department in Rochester, and was a regional representative for the Lincoln Kirstein-George Balanchine School of American Ballet.
        After the festival was discontinued, she helped found the Mercury Ballet Company of Rochester, taught at her own ballet school and choreographed for the Rochester Music Theater. In 1967 Miss Biracree moved to Fort Wayne, where she choreographed for the Fort Wayne Ballet Company and created liturgical dances.
        No immediate family members survive.
