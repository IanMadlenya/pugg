        Jacques Pic, the renowned chef of the Ardeche region of southern France, died of heart disease on Friday, his family announced Saturday. He was 59 years old.
        His restaurant, called simply Pic, near the town of Valence, was one of the few regularly awarded three stars in the authoritative Michelin Guide. Its specialities included truffle tarts garnished with foie gras and sea perch or salmon with caviar.
        Information on survivors other than his son was not immediately available.
