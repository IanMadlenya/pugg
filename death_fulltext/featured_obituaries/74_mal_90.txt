        John C. Fricano, a Washington lawyer and former litigator for the Department of Justice, died Sunday at his home in Arlington, Va. He was 62.
        Pancreatic cancer was the cause of death, a family spokesman said.
        Mr. Fricano concentrated on antitrust and commercial-fraud cases with an emphasis on white collar-racketeering suits. He wrote and lectured frequently about the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act and prosecuted and defended many RICO cases.
        Since 1976, he had been a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. He helped to establish the firm's office in Washington. He also was a law lecturer at Columbia University from 1978 to 1981.
        He began his career at the Department of Justice in 1956, after graduating from Fordham University's School of Law. He served as chief of the department's antitrust trial section.
        While at the department, he received the John Marshall Award, the department's highest honor for litigating attorneys.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Mary E. Kelly; two children, Lisa and Christopher Fricano, both of Arlington, and his mother, Lena Fricano of Rehoboth Beach, Del.
