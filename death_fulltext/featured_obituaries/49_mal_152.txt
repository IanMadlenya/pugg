        Eugene A. Forsey, one of Canada's foremost constitutional experts and a former senator, died Wednesday while vacationing in Victoria, British Columbia. He was 86 years old and lived in Ottawa.
        No cause of death was announced.
        Mr. Forsey served in the Canadian Parliament from 1970, when he was appointed to the upper chamber by former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, until he retired in 1979.
        He was an authority on the Canadian Constitution and in the 1980's was an outspoken critic of the Meech Lake Accord, a proposal, defeated last year, that would have recognized French-speaking Quebec as a distinct society.
        A graduate of McGill University and a former Rhodes Scholar at Balliol College at Oxford University, Mr. Forsey lectured at McGill from 1929 to 1941 and was research director for the forerunner of the Canadian Labor Congress.
        He is survived by two married daughters, Margaret Forsey and Helen Forsey, who retained their names; and two grandchildren.
