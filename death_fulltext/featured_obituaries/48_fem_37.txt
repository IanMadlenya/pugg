        She died of respiratory failure, the council's public relations director, Chuck Reichenthal, said.
        In 1966, Ms. Victor founded BACA, a community-based cultural organization, as an outgrowth of her work with the Prospect Park Centennial Committee. BACA has sponsored many arts events in Brooklyn.

Using the stage name Charlene Harris, she appeared in several Broadway shows, and performed on radio and television. She worked with Orson Welles and the Mercury Theater, and with Imogene Coca, Bob Fosse and Mel Brooks. She retired from the theater in the late 1940's and married Eugene Victor, a Brooklyn politician.
        She received awards for her work in the arts from several organizations, including the New York Board of Trade and the Arts and Business Council. In 1987, she was awarded the New York State Governor's Art Award.
        She is survived by two sons, Adam and Damon, of New York; a brother, Melvyn Harris of Chicago; a sister, Betty Zamore of Ventura, Calif., and three grandchildren.
