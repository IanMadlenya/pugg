        Harry F. Gaugh, a professor of art at Skidmore College and a specialist in the Abstract Expressionist period, died on Saturday at Glens Falls Hospital in Glens Falls, N.Y. He was 53 years old and lived in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.
        He died of lymphoma, said Robert Kimmerle, the director of college relations for Skidmore.
        Mr. Gaugh (pronounced gaw) was known for his work on postwar American artists. His book "The Vital Gesture: Franz Kline" (Abbeville Press, 1985) was the first full-length study on the Abstract Expressionist painter, and it accompanied a retrospective of the artist's work Mr. Gaugh organized for the Cincinnati Art Museum. He also wrote "Willem de Kooning" (Abbeville, 1983), and in 1979 organized an exhibition, "Franz Kline: The Color Abstractions," at the Phillips Gallery in Washington.
        He was born in Indianapolis on Nov. 21, 1938. After graduating from Indiana University in 1960, he worked as a police and court reporter in Chicago before receiving master's degrees in journalism and art history and a Ph.D. in art history.
        Mr. Gaugh is survived by an aunt, Harriet Pennington of Cleves, Ohio.
