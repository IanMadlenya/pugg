        Mr. Zymierski was an officer under Jozef Pilsudski in the fight for the independence of Poland, which was won in 1918.
        According to an official biography, Mr. Zymierski then split with Pilsudski and spent 1926 to 1931 as a political prisoner. His next seven years were spent in France.
        During World War II, he became allied with the Soviet-backed Communist forces and was an organizer of the underground Polish People's Army.
        He was a member of the first postwar Government formed under Soviet auspices on July 22, 1944, in Lublin.
        Known as the Lublin Committee, it was to form the core of the future governments as the Communists, backed by Stalin, consolidated power in Poland. Key appointments were made with Stalin's approval, with Mr. Zymierski taking charge of the military.
        He was given the rank of marshal of Poland in 1945, and was commander of the army and Defense Minister until 1949.
        Gradually falling from favor during the period of Stalinist purges in Poland, Mr. Zymierski was relieved of the military command in 1949 and imprisoned from 1952 until 1955.
        After 1956 he was rehabilitated and given a senior position in the National Bank. He retired in 1968.
        Born in the southern city of Cracow, Mr. Zymierski studied law at Jagiellonian University there.
