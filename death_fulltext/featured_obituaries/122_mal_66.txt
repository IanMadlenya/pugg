        Clark H. Johnson, the chief financial officer of Johnson & Johnson, the worldwide health care products company, died on Thursday at the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, N.J. He was 61 and had lived in Princeton Township.
        The cause was cancer, said Jeffrey Leebaw, a Johnson & Johnson spokesman.
        An accountant, Mr. Johnson joined the company in 1953, to spend the next four decades refining its financial systems. Ralph S. Larsen, Johnson & Johnson's chairman, praised him as an ''architect of systems of finance and control that have contributed in very profound ways to the great success our organization has enjoyed over the past 10 years.''
        At the time of his death, Mr. Johnson was president-elect of the Institute of Management Accounting.
        He is survived by his wife, Diane; two stepchildren, Lisa Goldschmidt and Adam Goldschmidt, who live at home; three sons from a previous marriage, Kevin of Woodbury, Conn., Todd of New York City and David of Boca Raton, Fla.; two sisters, Edith Troger and Carol Veshela of Lacey, N.J., and a grandson.
