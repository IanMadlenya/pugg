        Mrs. Goldberg was active in hospital volunteer work until she was well into her 80's, first at the New York Infirmary and later at the Hospital for Special Surgery and New York Hospital.
        She received the honorary Reuben Award (the cartoonists' equivalent of the Oscar) as the ''Mother'' of the National Cartoonists Society, the organization founded by her husband.
        She is survived by her sons, Thomas George of Princeton, N.J., and George W. George of Stamford, Conn.; six grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
