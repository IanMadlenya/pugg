        Stanley Asimov, a journalist and newspaper executive whose career spanned 40 years at Newsday on Long Island, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 66 and lived in Roslyn Heights, L.I.
        The cause was leukemia, his family said.
        Born in Brooklyn, Mr. Asimov graduated from New York University and the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.
        He joined Newsday as a reporter in 1952 and held a succession of editorial positions, up to assistant managing editor before being named assistant to the publisher in 1969. He served in executive posts responsible for, at various times, development, planning, recruitment and new technology. He retired in 1992 as vice president for editorial administration.
        Most recently, he edited a collection of letters by the author Isaac Asimov, his late brother, to be published by Doubleday in October.
        Mr. Asimov is survived by his wife of 40 years, Ruth Sheinaus Asimov; two sons, Daniel, of Palo Alto and Eric, of Manhattan, an editor and restaurant reviewer at The New York Times; a daughter, Nanette Asimov of San Francisco; a sister, Marcia Repanes of Maspeth, Queens, and two grandsons.
