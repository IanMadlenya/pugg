        Bryson Brennan Rash, an award-winning radio and television broadcaster whose career spanned more than half a century, died Tuesday at his home in Washington. He was 79 years old.
        He died of emphysema, his family said.
        Among the historic events he covered were the founding of the United Nations in San Francisco in 1945 and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s march on Washington in 1963.
        In his last public appearance on CNN last year, Mr. Rash gave his personal reminiscences about the Roosevelt White House at the time of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.
        Shortly after arriving in Washington in 1936, he went to work for CBS. He covered the White House for ABC from 1942 to 1956. He then went to NBC, where he was a reporter, anchor, commentator and editorial manager, a job he held when he retired in 1977.
        Since then, working independently, he was the host for a WETA public television program about Washington, "Monuments and Myths," which won an Emmy award in 1988. The next year he was the host of "Landmarks and Legends," about lesser known sites in Washington, also for WETA.
        He won Emmys in 1963 and 1973 for public service and the George Foster Peabody Award in 1973 for a series on home rule in Washington for WRC-TV.
        Mr. Rash was born in Los Angeles and grew up in St. Louis.
        He is survived by his wife, Julie Jenkins Rash; two daughters, Brennan Rash of Washington and Julianne Rash Weir of Dickinson, N.D., and two grandchildren.
