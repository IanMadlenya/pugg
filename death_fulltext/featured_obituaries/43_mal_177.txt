        Thomas Willson McKnew, chairman emeritus of the National Geographic Society, died Friday at Carriage Hill, a nursing home in Bethesda, Md. He was 94 and was a resident of McLean, Va.
        Mr. McKnew died of pneumonia, said Joy Aschenbach, a spokeswoman for the society.
        Mr. McKnew joined the National Geographic Society's staff in 1932 as its assistant secretary. He was elected vice president in 1954, vice chairman in 1962 and chairman in 1966. He was named chairman emeritus in 1987.
        As a member of the society's committee for research and exploration, Mr. McKnew participated in the financing of hundreds of research projects in geology, archeology, anthropology, botany, astronomy and related sciences.
        A native of Washington, D.C., Mr. McKnew joined the George A. Fuller Construction Company in 1915, and served as the company's construction superintendent from 1922 to 1925 while it was involved in building the Washington National Cathedral. From 1925 to 1931, he was vice president of the James Baird Construction Company.
        A year later, he joined the geographic society and in 1935 served as project officer for the first human flight into the stratosphere, in which two men ascended 72,395 feet in a giant balloon. During that flight, the curvature of the earth was photographed for the first time.
        Mr. McKnew is survived by his wife, Lenore.
