        Elsa Adler Bass, who with her first husband, Dr. Clarence Adler, operated a summer music colony at Lake Placid for almost 40 years, died Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 94 years old.
        Mrs. Bass, who was born in Mobile, Ala., came to New York City in 1912 to study music under Dr. Adler, and they were married in 1916. From 1924 to 1960, they operated Ka-rin-o-ke, a music colony whose Iroquois name means ''place of the beautiful song.'' Classical music was taught at the colony, and leading artists performed there.
        Clarence Adler died in 1968. Mrs. Adler's second husband, John Bass, died in 1978.
        She is survived by her son, Richard Adler of Manhattan, and one grandson.
