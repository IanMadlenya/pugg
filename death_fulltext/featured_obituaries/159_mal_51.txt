        Edward Gorey, whose eerie black-and-white cross-hatched drawings of hapless children and Victorian ministers charmed and haunted readers, died yesterday in Hyannis, Mass. He was 75.
        Mr. Gorey, an artist and writer who lived in Yarmouth Port, Mass., suffered a heart attack on Wednesday and died in Cape Cod Hospital.
        Mr. Gorey was known for writing at least 90 books, illustrating 60 others, and designing sets for stage productions, including ''Dracula'' on Broadway and ''Amphigorey,'' an Off Broadway play he wrote. He won a 1978 Tony award for costume design for ''Dracula.'' His best-known characters included the Gashlycrumb Tinies, one woebegone child for each letter of the alphabet, from Amy, who fell down the stairs, to Zillah, who drank too much gin. His work was influenced by Ionesco and Buster Keaton, Goya and Matisse.
        In the last two years he produced two books, ''The Haunted Tea-Cosy: A Dispirited and Distasteful Diversion for Christmas,'' and ''The Headless Bust: A Melancholy Meditation on the False Millennium.''
        In a 1996 book review of ''The World of Edward Gorey,'' Steve Heller wrote in The New York Times that the artist's satires ''are not mere commentaries on the manners and mores of a distant age; they are inventive narratives about evil adults, mischievous children, illicit lovers and improbable beasts.''
        Mr. Gorey grew up in Chicago, served in the Army, and attended Harvard University, where he roomed with the poet Frank O'Hara. He graduated in 1950, then moved to New York, working in the art department at Doubleday, where he would stay in the office at night to create his own books. His first book, ''The Doubtful Guest,'' in 1957, won acclaim from Edmund Wilson in the New Yorker. In 1962 he established Fantod Press to publish his works.
        He moved to Cape Cod in the late 1980's.
