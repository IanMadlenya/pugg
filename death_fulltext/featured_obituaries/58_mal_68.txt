        Donald T. Birdzell, a retired White House guard who was wounded defending President Harry S. Truman in a 1950 assassination attempt, died last Saturday. He was 82 years old.
        Mr. Birdzell was wounded in both knees in a gunfight with two Puerto Rican nationalists who tried to shoot their way into Blair House in Washington, where Truman was staying.
        A Secret Service agent and one of the attackers was killed in the battle, which took place while Truman was sleeping. The President was staying at the residence, which is used to house visiting dignitaries, while the White House was being renovated.
