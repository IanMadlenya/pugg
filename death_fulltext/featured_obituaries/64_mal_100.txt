        The Rev. Jude Mead, a Roman Catholic priest who was a preacher, lecturer and author, died on Saturday in his room in the Passionist Monastery in Jamaica, Queens. He was 72 years old and lived at the monastery.
        Father Mead died of an apparent heart attack, said the rector of the monastery, the Rev. Justin Kerber.
        Father Mead was director of the preaching ministry of the community for the Eastern United States.
        He was sent many times as the delegate of the Vatican to religious communities of Roman Catholic women in the United States to observe and report on revisions in their rules and constitutions after the Second Vatican Council, which opened in 1962.
        A native of Waltham, Mass., Father Mead wrote several books and contributed to numerous religious periodicals.
