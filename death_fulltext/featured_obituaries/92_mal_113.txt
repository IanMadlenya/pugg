        Angelo C. Petromelis, a member of the Civilian Complaint Review Board and a retired chairman of the State Crime Victims Board, died on Sunday at North Shore Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. He was 66 and lived in College Point, Queens.
        He had been suffering from a blood disorder and the cause was apparently kidney failure, said Tina Kaimos, the executive secretary of the Hellenic American Neighborhood Action Committee, of which he was a director at his death.
        Mr. Petromelis was also a Democratic district leader in the College Point area in the 1970's and was active in Democratic politics in Queens.
        He was appointed to the 12-member Civilian Complaint Review board in 1993.
        Mr. Petromelis retired from the Crime Victims Board in 1992 after serving on it for more than a decade and becoming chairman in 1990.
        He was born in Manhattan, grew up in the South Bronx, studied at New York University and taught at Staten Island College.
        Survivors include his wife of more than 30 years, Helen; a daughter, Simone O'Connor of Yonkers; two sons, Jonathan of Peabody, Mass., and Christopher of College Point; a sister, Mary Conelias of Windham, N.Y.; a brother, John of College Point; and three grandchildren.
