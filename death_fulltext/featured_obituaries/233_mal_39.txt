        Talcott W. Seelye, a former United States ambassador to Tunisia and Syria, died last Thursday at his home in Bethesda, Md. He was 84.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, his family said.
        A career diplomat, Mr. Seelye (pronounced SEE-lee) was the ambassador to Tunisia from 1972 to 1976 and to Syria from 1978 to 1981. In 1976, President Gerald R. Ford appointed him special envoy to Lebanon after the assassination there of the United States ambassador, Francis E. Meloy Jr., at the height of the country's civil war.
        During Mr. Seelye's years with the foreign service, he often angered supporters of Israel for advocating Israeli withdrawal from occupied lands. After retiring in 1981, he established Talcott Seelye Associates, a consultancy on Middle East affairs.
        Talcott Williams Seelye was born on March 6, 1922, in Beirut; his father, Laurens, taught philosophy at the American University there.
        During World War II, Mr. Seelye served as an Army officer in Iran and Italy. In 1947, he earned an undergraduate degree in history from Amherst College.
        Mr. Seelye began his career in foreign service in the late 1940's, quickly becoming a Middle East specialist. In the 1950's and 60's, he was a political officer in Jordan, a consul in Kuwait and deputy chief of mission and charg√© d'affaires in Saudi Arabia, among other postings.
        He held several positions in the State Department, including director of Arabian Peninsula affairs and senior deputy assistant secretary for African affairs.
        Mr. Seelye is survived by his wife, the former Joan Hazeltine, whom he married in 1950; four children, Lauren Seelye Harris of Washington; Ammanda Salzman of Riverside, Conn.; Talcott Jr., of Manhattan; and Kate, a former Middle East correspondent for National Public Radio, of Beirut; two sisters, Mary-Averett Seelye and Muriel Heineman, both of Mitchellville, Md.; and three grandchildren.
