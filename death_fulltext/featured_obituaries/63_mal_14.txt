        James Barrington, a former Burmese Ambassador to the United States and Canada and delegate to the United Nations, died on Monday in a hospital in Edmonton, Alberta. He was 80 years old and lived in Edmonton.
        His family said he died after a long illness.
        Mr. Barrington was born in Moulmein, Burma, where his British father was posted as a Forestry Service official. Burma, now known as Myanmar, was at the time an Indian province administered by Britain.
        Mr. Barrington attended Rangoon University and Oxford University before entering the Indian civil service in Burma. In World War II, he escaped capture by the Japanese by joining a group of British civilians who fled to India on foot. He later served as a captain in the British Army.
        He joined the Burmese Foreign Service after the war in Rangoon, now known as Yangon. His rank was the equivalent of an Under Secretary of State in Washington.
        Mr. Barrington was appointed Ambassador to the United States in 1950 and served at the same time as Burma's representative to the United Nations. In 1955, he returned to the Foreign Ministry in Rangoon.
        Burma sent him back to the United Nations as its representative in 1962, this time with the simultaneous assignment as Ambassador to Canada. He left the Burmese Foreign Service in 1965 and became a professor of history at the University of Alberta.
        Mr. Barrington is survived by his wife, the former Eileen Finney; a daughter, Marika Stone of Hoboken, N.J.; a brother, Thomas, of Canberra, Australia; a sister, Violet Ferdinands, of Ferny Hills, Queensland, Australia, and two grandchildren.
