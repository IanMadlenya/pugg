        Lyford N. Greene, a former chief economist of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company who helped influence Federal regulation of the telephone system, died on Tuesday at White Plains Hospital. He was 91.
        The cause of death was complications from heart disease.
        Born in Iowa, Mr. Greene was a graduate of Grinnell College and Northwestern University, where he received a master's degree in 1927. He began his career as an economist with Illinois Bell, moving to AT&T in 1929. He later became chief economist, filling that role until his retirement in 1969. Early in his career, Mr. Greene also taught statistics at Columbia University.
        Mr. Greene was chief economist at AT&T when the Federal Government was increasing its regulation of public utilities and their pricing policies. He was a strong proponent of the notion that capital-intensive industries, like the telephone system, need to earn a sufficient rate of return on their investments in plant and equipment. In that role he was closely involved in AT&T's responses to the so-called rate cases that the Federal Government brought to regulate telephone rates.
        Mr. Greene is survived by his wife, Margaret Emma-Louise Greene of Scarsdale, N.Y., a daughter, Gretchen Greene Yeo, the former head of foreign exchange at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, of New York City and Lowellville, Ohio; a son, Lyford Kluge Greene of Silver Spring, Md.; four grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.
