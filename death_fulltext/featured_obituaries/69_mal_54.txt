        Johnny Carisi, a jazz trumpeter and composer, died on Oct. 3 at Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 70 years old.
        He died of complications from heart surgery, said a friend, Don Leight.
        Mr. Carisi was best known for his compositions and arrangements, including "Israel" and "Springsville." He also wrote arrangements for everything from the big bands of Babe Russin, Glenn Miller, Ray McKinley, Charlie Barnet and Claude Thornhill to television shows and modern jazz ensembles like the drummer Max Roach's Double Quartet.
        But Mr. Carisi's main love was playing trumpet, and he spent a good portion of his life playing in as many different circumstances as possible. As a member of Glenn Miller's orchestra in the early 1940's, he learned to play be-bop by frequenting Minton's Playhouse, a nightclub in Harlem. He can be heard on recordings by Claude Thornhill and Gil Evans, among others. Played at Yankee Games
        Perceptive listeners could hear him between innings at Yankee Stadium, playing in the dixieland band, a form of employment that his contemporaries shunned but that he loved; he was a regular at Jimmy Ryan's club on West 52d Street, and performed with Jim Chapin's group, the Jazz Tree. He also performed with the band leader Loren Shoenberg and arranged for Mr. Roach. He took advantage of a Guggenheim Fellowship to compose a suite and spent a good part of the 1970's teaching at the Manhattan School of Music.
        Mr. Carisi had a warm, gorgeous sound that owed a bit to Miles Davis. He was harmonically sophisticated, and his solos, with a tight vibrato, were unceasingly intelligent. Mr. Carisi was playing and composing until two days before he entered the hospital for open-heart surgery.
        He is survived by his wife, Gemze, and a son, Peter, both of New York City, and another son, Jonathan, of Williamsburg, Mass.
