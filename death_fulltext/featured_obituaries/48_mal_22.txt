        Gerald L. Wallace, a tax lawyer and professor of law at New York University, died on Saturday, his 90th birthday, at his home in Old Greenwich, Conn.
        He was paralyzed in an accident four years ago and died of lung and kidney infections, his family said.
        Mr. Wallace was with the Manhattan law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore in 1945 when Arthur Vanderbilt, the dean of New York University's School of Law, recruited him to start a program in tax law. He taught at N.Y.U. until 1983. In 1966 he was given a Great Teacher Award by the university's Alumni Federation.
        He was born in Elgin, Ill., and was a graduate of the University of Illinois and of the Yale Law School. After teaching tax law at Northwestern University and at Yale, he became a special assistant to the United States Attorney General in 1941. He later served as chief of the criminal section of the Justice Department's tax division. He entered private practice as a tax specialist in 1944.
        Mr. Wallace is survived by his wife, the former Opal Newtson, whom he married in 1927; three sons, John, of Old Greenwich, Milton, of Cameron, Ont., and William, of Griswold, Conn; eight grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.
