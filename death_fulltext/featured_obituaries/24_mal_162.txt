        Drury lettered at Southern Cal from 1925-27. His coach there, Howard Jones, called him ''the greatest player I ever coached.''
        Drury gained 1,163 yards in 1927. It was 38 years before another Trojan rushed for 1,000 yards in a season. Mike Garrett had 1,440 yards in 1965. Drury ranks 14th on the Southern Cal career rushing list with 1,686 yards.
        Drury, the first Trojan inducted into the National Football Foundation College Football Hall of Fame, in 1954, also played basketball, water polo and ice hockey at Southern Cal.
