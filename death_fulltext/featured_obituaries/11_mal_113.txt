        Joseph I. Lichten, who served as head of the Vatican liaison office of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith for 15 years, died Monday at his home in Rome. He was 81.
        In 1964 and 1965, he represented the Anti-Defamation League during a debate of the Vatican Ecumenical Council in which the Roman Catholic hierarchy formally absolved Jews of guilt in the crucifixion of Jesus.
        Born in Poland, Dr. Lichten received a Doctor of Law degree from the University of Warsaw. He served as a diplomat for the Polish Government, and from 1941 to 1945 was attached to the Embassy of the Polish Government in Exile in Washington. When a Communist regime took control in Poland, he left the diplomatic service and became an American citizen.
        In 1945, Dr. Lichten joined the Anti-Defamation League as director of the Department of Intercultural Affairs, where he specialized in Roman Catholic-Jewish relations.
        From 1971 until his retirement in 1986, he served as head of the Anti-Defamation League's liaison office to the Vatican, and in 1986 he was honored by Pope John Paul II for his work in furthering mutual understanding between Jews and Catholics.
        Dr. Lichten was the author of ''A Question of Judgment - Pope Pius XII and the Jews,'' and was a frequent contributor to periodicals and books on interfaith matters.
        He is survived by his wife, Carol.
