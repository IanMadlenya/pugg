        Foy played for the Red Sox from 1966 through 1968, then was claimed by the Kansas City Royals in the expansion draft. He played one year for the Royals before being traded to the Mets for Amos Otis. He batted .236 in 99 games for the Mets in 1970, and ended his major league career the next year with the Washington Senators. His career batting average was .248.
        He is survived by his wife, a son, a daughter, two brothers and two sisters.
