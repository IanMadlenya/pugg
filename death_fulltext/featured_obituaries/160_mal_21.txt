        Gino Bartali, an Italian cycling champion whose victory in the 1948 Tour de France helped unite his politically torn country, died today at his home in Florence, his son Andrea Bartali said. He was 85.
        Bartali, who also won the Tour de France in 1938 and the Giro D'Italia in 1936, 1937 and 1946, was nicknamed the Iron Man of Tuscany for his endurance. Bartali, who was Catholic, was also known as Gino the Pious, especially after he surged ahead of the pack on the stage to the pilgrimage city of Lourdes in the 1948 Tour de France, a lead he maintained all the way to Paris.
        For older Italians, Bartali's victory was memorable for its soothing effect on one of the most politically edgy moments in postwar Italian history. Bartali's 1948 triumph occurred on the same day that the Communist leader Palmiro Togliatti was shot and wounded, an assassination attempt that brought Italian communists to the brink of insurrection.
        ''To say that civil war was averted by a Tour de France victory is surely excessive,'' said the former prime minister Giulio Andreotti, 81, who at the time was a young Christian Democrat politician. ''But it is undeniable that on that 14th of July of 1948, day of the attack on Togliatti, Bartali contributed to ease the tensions.''
        Bartali, who fought with the partisans during the last year of World War II, competed in 988 races between 1931 and 1954, winning 184.
        He is survived by his wife, Adriana, two sons and a daughter.
