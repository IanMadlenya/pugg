        Sylvester Campbell, a dancer who performed with the Dutch National Ballet and other troupes in Europe, Canada and the United States, died on March 9 at the Genesis-Eldercare Randallstown Center in Baltimore.
        The cause was respiratory failure, said Peggy Lynne, a friend.
        Mr. Campbell, known for his strong technique and sensitive partnering, was a pioneer among black classical dancers.
        Sometimes referred to as ''the black Nureyev,'' he was described by the English ballet writer Fernau Hall as possessing ''a classical style of great purity, combined with fire, nobility and all the other classical virtues.''
        Born Sylvester Briscoe in Oklahoma City, Mr. Campbell tap-danced as a child and trained in ballet at the Jones-Haywood School of Ballet in Washington and the New York City Ballet's School of American Ballet. He joined the New York Negro Ballet in 1956 and traveled to England.
        Mr. Campbell remained in Europe, studying at the schools of the Royal Ballet and Rambert Ballet in London and with Russian teachers in Paris. He performed on the BBC, with a touring English revue and with small ballet companies in Europe before joining the Dutch National Ballet, in which he danced from 1960 to 1970 in a reperatory that included lead roles in the classics and in ballets by George Balanchine and Jack Carter.
        He was also a guest artist with Maurice Bejart from 1972 to 1975. He coached ballerinas for international ballet competitions in Moscow and Varna, Bulgaria, winning honors as their partner.
        Mr. Campbell returned to the Washington are in 1975 and danced with the Capitol Ballet, of which he was also associate director, and with the Maryland Ballet. He was the head of the dance department at the Baltimore School for the Arts for 15 years. His last performance was in 1992.
        There were no survivors.
