        William F. Laporte, a former president and chairman of the American Home Products Corporation, died on Sept. 10 at his home in Manhattan. He was 88 and also lived in Buck Hill Falls, Pa.
        Mr. Laporte oversaw American Home for two decades and built it into one of the biggest producers of pharmaceuticals and household chemicals in the world, in part the result of much advertising on television.
        He favored a hands-on approach to management and marketing. When he retired as chief executive in 1981, the company's revenue, earnings and dividends had grown every year since 1965.
        By then its biggest-selling products included the drugs Ativan, for anxiety, and Inderal, for hypertension and high blood pressure. Among its household names were Anacin and Preparation H. Yet the company itself was relatively unpublicized.
        While Mr. Laporte ran American Home, its headquarters was in Manhattan; now, it is in Madison, N.J., and its products are prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals.
        He joined American Home in 1938 and rose to president, serving from 1960 to 1965. In 1965-73, he was chairman, president and chief executive; chairman and chief executive in 1973-81; and chairman of the executive committee in 1981-86.
        A native New Yorker, Mr. Laporte graduated from Princeton and received a master's degree in business administration from Harvard.
        He was a trustee of New York Presbyterian Hospital and the Dime Savings Bank of New York.
        His wife of 53 years, the former Ruth W. Hillard, died before him.
        He is survived by two daughters, Suzanne L. Westcott and Lynn A. Ducommon; a son, William F. III; and nine grandchildren.
