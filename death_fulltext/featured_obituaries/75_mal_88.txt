        The Rev. Joseph A. Sellinger, who as president of Loyola College transformed a small commuters' school into one of the nation's leading Jesuit universities, died yesterday in the President's House on the campus at Baltimore. He was 72.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, said Mark Kelly, a spokesman for the university.
        Father Sellinger was president of Loyola for almost 30 years.
        Founded in 1852, Loyola College today has an operating budget of $65 million and 400 professors teaching 3,000 students, of whom 55 percent are women. When Father Sellinger was named president of Loyola in 1964, it had a budget of $1.4 million, barely 100 professors and 2,000 male students.  Several Milestones
        During Father Sellinger's presidency, Loyola acquired its first dormitory in 1967, established a separate School of Business and Management in 1983, elected the first lay chairman of the Board of Trustees in 1971 and admitted women in 1971, after merging with Mt. Saint Agnes College.
        When Loyola's growth was threatened by a suit alleging that state aid to church-related colleges and universities was in violation of the First Amendment, Father Sellinger joined other private institutions in preparing a defense. This led to a 5-to-4 decision by the Supreme Court in 1976 upholding Maryland's aid to church-affiliated colleges.
        In 1990, Father Sellinger began a $40 million, five-year capital campaign. Under his direction, students have also increased volunteer community service in Baltimore, the Appalachian Mountains and as far afield as Mexico.
        Father Sellinger was born in Philadelphia. In 1938, he entered the Society of Jesus and was assigned to the seminary at Wernersville, Pa., then transferred to Spring Hill College in Alabama. At 24, he began teaching chemistry, German, philosophy and logic at Loyola. After ordination at the Facultes St. Albert de Louvain in Belgium in 1951, he became professor in the Theology Department at Georgetown, then dean of college until he went to Loyola.
        He is survived by his brother, Frank Sellinger Jr., of Williamsburg, Va.
        A wake will be held in the Alumni Memorial Chapel at Loyola at 7:30 P.M. tomorrow. A service will be held at the Cathedral of Mary Our Queen in Baltimore at 7:30 P.M. Thursday, and a funeral Mass will be offered at the cathedral at 10 A.M. Friday.
