        Roger-A. d'Hulst, an authority on the art of Peter Paul Rubens and Jacob Jordaens, died in Brussels on Feb. 15. He was 77.
        Dr. d'Hulst earned a Ph.D. in art history from the University of Ghent in 1955, writing his dissertation on Jacob Jordaens's drawings. In 1959 he was co-founder of the Belgian Institute for the study of 16th- and 17th-century Flemish art, serving as its director until shortly before his death.
        Central to the institute's importance was the extensive research library that Ludwig Burchard, the German Rubens scholar, ceded to it at the urging of Dr. d'Hulst. At the institute, Dr. d'Hulst oversaw the publication of a series of volumes on Flemish artists, most notably a large-scale project on Rubens's enormous output that has involved several authors and numbers 20 volumes to date.
        In addition to numerous articles, Dr. d'Hulst wrote a four-volume work on Jordaens's drawings (1974), as well as a monograph (1982) and was largely responsible for the reconstruction of the artist's work. He also wrote books on  Rubens's drawings (1963, with Burchard), Rubens's oil sketches (1968) and Flemish tapestries (1971).
        Beginning in 1949, Dr. d'Hulst worked as a curator at the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Brussels. He was also a professor at Ghent University from 1957 to  1985.
