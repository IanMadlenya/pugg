        Marty James, a counselor who said on national television that he helped people with AIDS commit suicide, took his own life after battling the disease, a friend said. He was 38 years old.
        Mr. James died on Dec. 25 at his West Hollywood home after taking sleeping pills, his companion, Steven Kanengiser, said over the weekend. "The pain became unmanageable," Mr. Kanengiser said.
        On March 31, 1988, on ABC's "Nightline," Mr. James described how he helped a friend with AIDS-related complex end his life by mixing a lethal dose of barbiturates in a glass of grape juice.
        "He had lived a very good life and he wanted a very good death," Mr. James said on the news show, noting that he, too, had the disease.
        Mr. James later said he helped at least eight men with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome commit suicide over five years.
        Survivors accused him of murder, but prosecutors declined to file criminal charges, saying their investigations turned up no evidence beyond Mr. James's statements.
        In 1983, Mr. James helped found the Los Angeles chapter of the Shanti Foundation, which trains volunteer counselors to work with AIDS patients. Mr. James left the organization in 1985 and worked as a private counselor on terminal illness. The Shanti group disavowed his views on assisted suicide.
