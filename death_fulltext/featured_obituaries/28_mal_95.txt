        Kenneth Farnham Duchac, director emeritus of the Brooklyn Public Library, died of liver cancer Tuesday at the Bon Secours Extended Care Facility Hospice in Ellicott City, Md. He was 66 years old and lived in Ellicott City and Sarasota, Fla.
        Mr. Duchac was with the library from 1969 until his retirement in 1986, when he became the only person in the library's 90-year history to be honored with the title director emeritus. He had been appointed director in 1970.
        Mr. Duchac led the library through the difficult days of the city's fiscal crisis in the mid-1970's. Despite severe budget cutbacks, he was credited with keeping every branch library in Brooklyn open. He also set in motion a computerized circulation system which, when it is completed, will be the largest of its kind in the United States, linking library branches in all five boroughs.
        He was born in Antigo, Wis., graduated from Carroll College in Waukesha, Wis., in 1947 and earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago's Library School the same year.
        He is survived by his wife, Gretchen; two sons, Frederic, of Brooklyn, and John, of Los Angeles; two brothers, Richard, of Antigo, and Joseph, of Brooklyn, and four grandchildren.
