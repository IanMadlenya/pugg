        Philip Dorf, a New York public-relations executive, died on Sunday while swimming at a resort in Westchester County. He was 72 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        At the time of his death, Mr. Dorf was vice chairman of Robert Marston Corporate Communications, a subsidiary of the public-relations concern of Robert Marston & Associates. Altogether, he spent nearly five decades in communications, starting as a radio-news writer with United Press in New York.
        He had also been associated with Tex McCrary Inc., N. W. Ayer Public Relations, the Rowland Company and Harshe-Rotman & Druck Inc., which he left to join the Marston company.
        Mr. Dorf, who was born in the Bronx, graduated from New York University in 1942. He then fought in Europe in World War II as an infantry captain. For nearly 50 years he was active in charity endeavors, raising funds for Boy Scout summer camps for Bronx youths.
        Mr. Dorf is survived by his wife of 46 years, Nathalie Bernstein Dorf; his mother, Minnie Dorf of Coney Island; two sons, Robert of Stamford, Conn., and Lewis of Pomona, N.Y.; a daughter, Peggy Dorf of San Francisco; a sister, Lorraine Gluckstern of Franklin Square, L.I., and three grandchildren.
