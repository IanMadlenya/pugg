        Philip Hobsbaum, a British poet and literary critic whose workshops and criticism helped inspire a new generation of writers, including Seamus Heaney, died on Tuesday in Glasgow. He was 72.
        The cause was complications of diabetes, said the University of Glasgow, where he was a professor emeritus of English literature.
        Professor Hobsbaum, who had his own poetry published on both sides of the Atlantic, helped start noted writing seminars in Cambridge, London, Belfast and Glasgow. While teaching at Queen's University in Belfast from 1962 to 1966, he fostered emerging poets like Mr. Heaney.
        In a later tribute, Mr. Heaney, the 1995 Nobel laureate in literature, credited Professor Hobsbaum with having given his generation of poets ''a sense of themselves.''
        Professor Hobsbaum's influential work included ''Metre, Rhythm and Verse Form'' (Routledge, 1996), which remains in print. His ''Reader's Guide to Charles Dickens,'' first published in the United States by Farrar, Straus in 1973, is also in print. His other books include ''A Reader's Guide to D.H. Lawrence'' (1981), ''A Reader's Guide to Robert Lowell'' (1988), ''A Theory of Communication'' (1970), ''Tradition and Experiment in English Poetry'' (1979) and ''Essentials of Literary Criticism'' (1983).
        Professor Hobsbaum contributed to more than a dozen poetry anthologies and published four collections of his poems.
        Philip Dennis Hobsbaum was born in London and raised in Yorkshire. He studied with F.R. Leavis at Cambridge, from which he graduated in 1955 and received a master's in 1961. He received his Ph.D. from Sheffield University in 1968.
        He started writing and lecturing in 1955 and, after teaching in Belfast, moved to Glasgow in 1966 as a lecturer in English. He advanced to senior lecturer in 1972 and was named a professor in 1985.
        Professor Hobsbaum is survived by his wife of 29 years, Rosemary, and two stepdaughters, the university said.
