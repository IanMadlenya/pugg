        Millard A. Ring, a retired immigration and customs lawyer who represented many foreign artists and performers, died on Wednesday at his home in Glen Cove, L.I. He was 76 years old.
        He died of a stroke, his family said.
        Among his clients for immigration and visas were the Bolshoi, Moiseyev and Royal Ballet dance companies, opera stars, the painter Marc Chagall, the actress Vanessa Redgrave and performers brought to the United States by the impresario Sol Hurok.
        Mr. Ring also handled customs proceedings for importing Mr. Chagall's paintings for Lincoln Center and sets and costumes for performers.
        Born in Wilmington, Del., Mr. Ring grew up in Brooklyn. He graduated from St. John's University and earned his law degree there in 1937.
        He began working for a customs brokerage, then expanded to immigration law, practicing in lower Manhattan until his retirement two years ago.
        Surviving are his wife of 55 years, the former Sylvia Abrams; two sons, Alan, of Plainview, L.I., and Stuart, of Toronto; a daughter, Victoria Rich, of East Meadow, L.I.; a brother, Malvin, of Rochester; a sister, Deena Dunn, of Los Angeles, and seven grandchildren.
