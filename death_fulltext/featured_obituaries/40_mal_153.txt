        Bishop Lawrence M. Graziano, a Franciscan missionary in Central America and South America for most of his adult life, died of a heart attack Wednesday at the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center. He was 69 years old and was stricken while traveling from confirmation services on Staten Island to his residence at the Mount Carmel Friary in Mount Vernon, N.Y.
        Bishop Graziano, a Bronx native, was ordained in 1947 and was sent to missions in Central America. In 1956, he was appointed Delegate Provincial of the Commissariat of Central America. Four years later, he was named Vicar General of the Santa Ana Diocese in El Salvador. He was made a bishop in Santa Ana in 1961.
        Bishop Graziano returned to Mount Vernon in 1969, but went to Colombia, Bolivia and Peru in the 1970's to evaluate the work of priests there.
        He is survived by a sister, Marie Vicario of Seneca, S.C.
