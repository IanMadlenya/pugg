        Under Mr. Layton's direction, from 1964 to 1969, the capital's Police Department accelerated recruiting and promoting of black officers and began human relations training.
        But the Chief was frequently criticized by blacks for his inability to ease tensions between officers and black residents, particularly in the wake of the 1968 riots that followed the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The Chief retired after Patrick V. Murphy, a former New York City Police Commissioner, was hired by the District of Columbia as his superior to oversee the Washington police.
        Mr. Layton then became a special assistant to the chief of protocol at the State Department, where he spent two years.
        He was born in Washington and joined the police force in 1936. An expert marksman, he represented the United States on the rapid-fire pistol team in the 1948 Olympic Games. He moved through the Police Department's ranks in narcotics and internal investigation, and as chief of detectives.
        He was a former president of the National Rifle Association.
        Surviving are his wife, Mazella; three daughters, Barbara Henson of Rockville, Md., Virginia Chadwick of Ooltewah, Tenn., and Dorothy Herrington of Clarksburg, Va.; a son, John of Clinton, Md.; 16 grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.
