        Mr. Gormley, a graduate of Fordham Preparatory School in the Bronx, was general manager of the Gormley Brick Yards and was one of the last of the Haverstraw brick makers. His bricks were used in the construction of the state prison at Ossining, N.Y., as well as the buildings at Graymoor, the Roman Catholic institution in Garrison, N.Y.
        The last shipment of Gormley bricks was sent to New York City by boat on April 13, 1938. Mr. Gormley then became a general contractor for the Army during the construction of Camp Shanks, at Orangeburg, N.Y., a major point of embarkation for troops during World War II.
        He is survived by his wife, Gertrude; two sons, Matthew, of Arlington, Va., and Thomas, of Garnerville, and five grandchildren.
