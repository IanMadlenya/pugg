        Peter F. Cannell, a former director of the Smithsonian Institution's book-publishing division and an expert on songbirds' voices, died on Saturday at his home in Bethesda, Md. He was 47.
        The cause was a brain tumor, said his brother Michael.
        Dr. Cannell had worked in editorial and other administrative posts at the Smithsonian Institution Press since 1988. He stepped down as director last year for health reasons.
        As the director, he made use of material from the world of science in books meant for lay readers.
        Dr. Cannell was also editor of the ''Smithsonian Series in Comparative Evolutionary Biology'' from 1989 to 1997.
        Born in Manhattan, he graduated from Bowdoin College in Maine and received a doctorate from the City University of New York, where he majored in systematic biology. He was an authority on the evolution of songbirds' vocal mechanisms.
        Besides his brother Michael, of Manhattan, he is survived by his wife, Amanda; two sons, Tom and Oliver, both of Bethesda; a daughter, Louisa, of Bethesda; his parents, Peter B. and Ann Cannell of Lattingtown, N.Y.; two other brothers, William, of Ketchum, Idaho, and J. Carlow, of San Francisco; and a sister, Cynthia Gross of Manhattan.
