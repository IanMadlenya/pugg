        John M. Falabella, a designer for theater and television, died last Tuesday in New York City. He was 40.
        The cause was AIDS, his press representatives, Boneau/Bryan-Brown, said.
        Mr. Falabella designed 14 Broadway shows, including Harvey Fierstein's "Safe Sex," Edward Albee's "Lady From Dubuque" and "Harry Connick Jr. on Broadway." Most recently he was the artistic supervisor and costume designer for "Tango Pasion." He also worked Off Broadway and at regional theaters around the country, among them the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Conn., the Walnut Street Theater in Philadelphia and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.
        His television credits include "Broadway Sings: The Music of Jule Styne" and five Tony Awards shows for CBS. He also designed many AIDS benefits, including "The Best of the Best: A Show of Concern" at the Metropolitan Opera House in 1985.
        He was also the head of the scenic design program at Boston University, where he taught since 1986.
        He is survived by his companion, Laren T. Lambdin; his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Falabella, of New Hyde Park, L.I., and a brother, Anthony.
