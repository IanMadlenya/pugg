        James E. Thomson, who started as a message runner for Merrill Lynch and rose to become its president and board chairman, died on Sunday while on a vacation in France. He was 87 years old and lived in Indian Wells, Calif.
        Information on the cause of death was not available. A company spokesman said Mr. Thomson had a history of heart disease.
        Mr. Thomson capped his 46-year career with Merrill Lynch with his promotion to the presidency in 1966 and to chairman and chief executive in 1969. He retired two years later.
        He specialized in internal operations and led Merrill's conversion to computerized records and transactions.
        He was born in Ontario, Canada, and attended New York University. He started working for Merrill Lynch in New York in 1924. In the aftermath of the 1929 stock market crash, Merrill Lynch sold its retail division to E. A. Pierce & Company. He transferred to Pierce and managed its back-office operations in Detroit and Cleveland.
        In 1940, Pierce merged with Merrill Lynch, and Mr. Thomson returned to Wall Street as the company's assistant to the operations division director. In 1948, he was promoted to operations division director and also became a partner in the firm. In 1964, he was named executive vice president.
        He is survived by his wife of 65 years, the former Dorothy Miskimin; a son, Donald, of Palm Springs, Calif.; a daughter, Joan Jurgensen of Palm Desert, Calif., and six grandchildren.
