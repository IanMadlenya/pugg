        The Venerable Oung Mean, who was Cambodia's third highest ranking Buddhist monk and became a religious and cultural leader of expatriates in America, died on March 16 at a hospital in Olney, Md. He was 66.
        The cause was a heart attack, said associates at the Cambodian Buddhist Society in Silver Spring, Md., where he lived.
        Mr. Oung Mean (pronounced uhng MEE-uhn) expanded the society and raised more than $2 million to build its new headquarters and the adjoining Wat Buddhikarma, a replica of a Cambodian temple. It has become a center for Cambodian Buddhists in North America, most of them displaced by the civil war in their native land.
        Serving as the wat's chief monk and a society leader, he sponsored the immigration of monks from refugee camps, conducted Buddhist services across the United States, organized literacy and religion classes and trained new monks.
        In Cambodia he served as a special adviser to the national Buddhist Patriarch, wrote 10 religious books, translated books and scrolls from Khmer to English, taught the Pali language at the Buddhist University in Phnom Penh and was a representive at international religious conferences.
        He was working on a doctorate in religion in England, when civil war broke out in Cambodia. He came to the United States in 1978.
        Surviving is a sister, Oung Hieng of Cambodia.
