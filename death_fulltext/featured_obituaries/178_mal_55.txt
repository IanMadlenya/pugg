        Andrew McNally III, a former president of the map maker Rand McNally & Company, died on Thursday at his home in Chicago. He was 92.
        He was a great-grandson of another Andrew McNally, who was a co-founder of the company in the mid-1800's.
        The company started out printing tickets and other documents for railroads. In the 1870's, it also took up making maps, at first for a railway guide. Before long it was regarded as the foremost manufacturer of maps and related products.
        In the mid-1950's, with Mr. McNally as president, the company, based in Skokie, Ill., turned out more than a quarter-million items a year, including globes and atlases, in addition to 65 million road maps. Sales at the company more than doubled in his first seven years as president.
        Mr. McNally joined the company in 1931 in Chicago and was president from 1948 to 1974 and chairman from 1974 to 1993. Its sales soared in the post-World War II years to $18.5 million in 1954 from $8.3 million in 1948.
        ''Wars and tight international situations make the biggest booms for the map business,'' he said in 1949, when the company published ''Cosmopolitan World Atlas,'' 352 pages long and eight years in the making.
        Also in 1949, the company modernized its map production and bought a big book-manufacturing plant, the W. B. Conkey Company in Hammond, Ind.
        Mr. McNally was succeeded as president and later as chairman by his son Andrew McNally IV. In the late 1990's, control of the company was acquired by an investment group, AEA, based in New York.
        Mr. McNally, a son of yet another Andrew McNally, who became the company's chairman, was born in Chicago and graduated in 1931 from Yale College. He was an Army officer in World War II.
        His wife, Margaret, died before him.
        In addition to Andrew IV, Mr. McNally is survived by another son, Edward C.; a daughter, Betsy Ravenel; seven grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.
