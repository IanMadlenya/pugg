        George Nichols Rainsford, who was president of Lynchburg College in Lynchburg, Va., for 10 years, died last Thursday at Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital in Santa Rosa, Calif. He was 65 and lived in Windsor, Calif.
        He died of colon cancer, the college said.
        Mr. Rainsford was a college administrator for much of his life, after a short period in private law practice. A graduate of the University of Chicago, he received a law degree from Yale Law School in 1954, a master's degree from the University of Denver in 1963 and a Ph.D. in American history from Stanford University.
        He was an associate dean and then assistant to the president of the University of Colorado. In 1972, Mr. Rainsford became president of Kalamazoo College in Kalamazoo, Mich., and served there until he was named president of Lynchburg, a liberal arts college founded in 1903 by the Disciples of Christ. He retired last year.
        He is survived by his wife, Jean; his mother, Christina Rainsford, of Katonah, N.Y.; a son, the Rev. Guy Rainsford of Chattanooga, Tenn.; four daughters, Amy Stephenson of Santa Rosa, Anne Webb of Windsor, Angela Brunk of Portland, Ore., and Emily Rainsford of Cotati, Calif., and four grandchildren.
