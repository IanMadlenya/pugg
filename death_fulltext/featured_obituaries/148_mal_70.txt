        Thomas C. Cochran, an authority on the economic history of the United States who liked to chronicle how economics and business had touched his fellow citizens' lives, died on May 2 at the Quadrangle retirement center in Haverford, Pa. He was 97.
        Professor Cochran, a prolific writer, retired in 1972 as Benjamin Franklin Professor of History at the University of Pennsylvania. He was a former president of the American Historical Association and of the Organization of American Historians.
        Professor Eric Foner, a historian at Columbia University, said in a telephone interview: ''In the 40's, 50's and 60's, he was definitely one of the most important economic historians of the United States. His book 'The Age of Enterprise' was a very important history of American capitalism.
        ''He did a kind of history which was institutional, about people, about the structures of economic change and the impact of capitalism on people's lives. Today, economic history is all statistics and model-building.''
        Looking back, late in his career, on his own writings, Professor Cochran observed: ''The principal aim of some 50 years of writing history has been to convince readers that business has been the most important American social institution from the Colonial period on. My aim has always been to write cultural, not narrowly economic, history, to place business as a social force as important as politics, or religion.''
        He was born in Manhattan and received bachelor's and master's degrees from New York University and a doctorate from Pennsylvania. He taught at N.Y.U. before joining the Pennsylvania faculty.
        An early marriage ended in divorce. His second wife, the former Rosamond Beebe, died.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Ann Widmer.
