        Arthur Alexander, a Southern soul singer whose recordings influenced the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, Bob Dylan and Elvis Presley, died on Wednesday in Nashville. He was 53.
        His manager, Danny Kahn, said the cause was respiratory and heart failure.
        Mr. Alexander was a cornerstone of the Muscle Shoals sound, a terse, steady-chugging style, part gospel and part country, that was ideally suited to gritty confessional storytelling.
        Although his recordings never established him as a star, his songs were prized by musicians and collectors, and were imitated by the Beatles (who recorded his song "Anna") and the Rolling Stones (who recorded his "You Better Move On").
        Mr. Alexander was born on May 10, 1940, in Florence, Ala., the son of a guitarist who worked in local clubs. By the age of 13, he was singing in a gospel group, the Heartstrings. The First Record
        He made his first record, "Sally Sue Brown" (recently recorded by Bob Dylan) in 1961, and later that year he was the first to record at Rick Hall's Fame Studio in Muscle Shoals, Ala., working with the musicians who would become the house band for hits by Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett and others.
        He toured extensively during the 1960's, and his songs were recorded by Elvis Presley and Otis Redding, among others.
        But after 1975, Mr. Alexander dropped out of performing, only re-emerging in 1991 at a songwriters' showcase at the Bottom Line in New York.
        He signed a new recording contract, with Nonesuch's American Explorer series, and completed an album, "Lonely Just Like Me," that was released in May.
        Mr. Alexander is survived by his wife and three children.
