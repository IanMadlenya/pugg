        The Rev. Charles W. Ranson, a former general secretary of the International Missionary Council, a forerunner of the World Council of Churches, died of a heart attack Saturday at his home in Delray Beach, Fla. He was 84 years old and also had a home in Lakeville, Conn.
        Mr. Ranson was born in Northern Ireland and attended Queens University in Belfast and Oriel College in Oxford before entering the ministry of the Methodist Church in Ireland in 1929. He then embarked on a missionary career that took him to India. During that time, he wrote a book on the problems of urbanization in India.
        In 1947, he moved to New York to serve as the general secretary of the International Missionary Council, which at the time included 60 Protestant denominations in this country and 26 interdenominational missionary councils throughout the world.
        In 1958, he resigned to become director of the Theological Education Fund.
        After serving as president of the Methodist Church in Ireland from 1961 to 1962, he worked as a professor of theology and dean of the school of theology at Drew University in Madison, N.J.
        He was dismissed, however, in 1967 in a bitter administrative dispute with the university president. Mr. Ranson contended at the time that the theological school should enjoy greater autonomy within the university.
        He then became professor of theology at the Hartford Seminary in Connecticut, where he remained until his retirement in 1975.
        Mr. Ranson is survived by his wife, Mary Claire Vanhagen; a daughter, K. Ann Ranson of New Milford, Conn.; a son, John, of Manhattan, and five grandchildren.
