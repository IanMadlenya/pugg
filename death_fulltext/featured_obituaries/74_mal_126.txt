        Gregory J. Batt, who led Colgate to its only undefeated hockey season as a player-coach in 1943 and later coached the Hamilton College team for 36 seasons until his retirement in 1984, died on Monday at the Masonic Home in Utica, N.Y. He was 73.
        He had been suffering from Alzheimer's disease, Hamilton officials said.
        A fearless, compactly built center, he scored 52 of Colgate's 116 goals and had 36 assists during the 11-0 season, including a 12-3 victory over Army.
        After serving as a Marine squad leader in the Pacific during World War II and winning a Purple Heart on Okinawa, he turned to coaching while continuing as a player with the Clinton Comets of the New York-Ontario League.
        He is survived by his wife, Jane; a son, Gregory W.; and two daughters, Jane Ann Batt and Diane Smith.
