        Mr. Simonson, who lived in Suffern, died of cancer, his family said.
        The main themes of his career were education, mass communication and Jewish religion and culture.

Then he produced and directed plays on radio while earning his degree from Brooklyn Law School and a master of arts from Brooklyn College. Later he received a doctorate in philosophy from Northwestern University and was ordained by the Chicago Rabbinical Academy.
        In various teaching posts and writings, he explored such topics as logic, the analysis of propaganda, radio law, the cultural changes of television and violence in the media. He founded the communication center at the State University of New York at Fredonia and headed the New York Speech Association and a state Regents advisory committee to promote instruction in public speaking.
        Mr. Simonson founded the first Jewish congregation in Pueblo, Colo., and for several years led Congregation Beth Shalom in Park Ridge, N.J. He wrote plays and poetry as well as academic books and articles.
        He is survived by his wife, Hana; three children, Shai, of Sharon, Mass.; Rayze, of Forest Hills, and Alexander, of Manhattan, and a sister, Libby, of Scottsdale, Ariz.
