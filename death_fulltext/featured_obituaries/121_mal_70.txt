        Dr. Arnost Kleinzeller, an emeritus professor of physiology at the University of Pennsylvania who studied the way cells regulate their fluids, died on Feb. 1 at his home in Philadelphia. He was 82.
        The cause was lung cancer, the university said.
        Dr. Kleinzeller studied how cells maintain their water and salt levels.
        Dr. Kleinzeller also carried out research on how the sugars in the fluid filtered by the kidneys get back into the blood. One of his most important observations was that blocking a major mechanism for removing salt, called the sodium pump, did not cause rapid swelling of the kidney cells.
        He was born in Ostrava, in what is now the Czech Republic, and graduated from the Masaryk University Medical School in Brno. After the signing of the Munich pact, he fled to England just before the advance of the German armies and received a doctorate in biochemistry at the University of Sheffield. He returned to Czechoslovakia in 1944 at the invitation of the government-in-exile to set up health care in newly liberated areas. But under a Communist Government, he was viewed with suspicion because he had been in the West, said his wife, Lotte, of Philadelphia.
        Dr. Kleinzeller came to the United States and joined the Penn faculty as a professor in 1967. He wrote more than 150 scientific papers and was an editor of the series ''Current Topics in Membranes and Transport.''
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Anna Romancova, of Prague, and Jana Richman, of Forest Hills, Queens.
