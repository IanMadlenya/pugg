        Patricia Harper, who was among the first women to become a television news anchor, died yesterday in her home in Spain. She was 59.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Karen Scott, an executive producer at WPIX-TV in New York City and a longtime friend of Ms. Harper.
        Ms. Harper, who grew up in New York, began her career in 1974 as a co-anchor for WPIX, where she won two local Emmy awards.
        She went on to become the first female anchor of an independent national news broadcast in 1980 when she anchored "USA Tonight," a syndicated show televised in 200 cities.
        "Through her courage and fortitude, she was able to forge ahead in this industry and provide a path for other women to follow," Ms. Scott said. "She was a gutsy lady."
        In 1984, Ms. Harper moved to WNBC-TV to co-anchor of the 6 P.M. news with Chuck Scarborough. It was during her tenure that the station won five successive Emmys from 1984 to 1989 for Outstanding Single Newscast.
        She won an Emmy herself during that period for a series she reported on the plight of New York City's homeless population.
        "She spent many nights on the street with the homeless," Ms. Scott said. "She wanted to get the feel of what they had to go through being homeless on the streets of New York."
        Ms. Harper retired from WNBC in 1990 and moved to Capiliera, a city in the Grenada province of Spain.
        She is survived by two sons, Arden DeBrun of Tuttle, Okla., and Scott DeBrun of Plano, Tex.; a daughter, Michelle Ogut of Monroe, N.Y., and five grandchildren.
