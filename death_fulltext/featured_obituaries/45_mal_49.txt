        William Wilbur Weir, former director of the American Academy on Cyprus and past editor of The Christian Statesman, died Sunday at the hospital unit of the Reformed Presbyterian Home in Pittsburgh. He was 97 years old and lived in Beaver Falls, Pa.
        He died of heart failure, said his son, Richard B. Weir of Bronxville, N.Y.
        It was in 1916 that Mr. Weir began teaching in Larnaca at the American Academy, operated by the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Narth America. He was named director of the 300-student school in 1921 and, except for sabbaticals and time spent studying for a doctor of education degree at Teachers College in 1953, he was there until he returned to the United States in 1961.
        The American Academy was the only school on Cyprus where students of Greek and Turkish origin studied together in their classes. In 1961, he became administrative secretary of the National Reform Association, an ecumenical group, and was editor of their publication, The Christian Statesman. He retired in 1973. In addition to his son, he is survived by a daughter, Margaret Carson of Beaver Falls, Pa.; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
