        Melvin Blake, an oral surgeon whose collection of figurative art formed the opening exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, died on March 14 at New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 71.
        The cause was melanoma, said Emily Blake, his niece.
        Dr. Blake was chief of dentistry and oral and maxillofacial surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan from 1977 to 1989. With his companion, Frank Purnell, he began to buy art in the 1960's, concentrating on figurative realism when abstraction was the dominant style. For nearly 40 years, they collected work by such artists as Balthus, Lucian Freud, R. B. Kitaj and Larry Rivers.
        They took particular interest in contemporary Spanish and Latin American painting, particularly the work of Antonio Lopez Garcia and Claudio Bravo. ''Form and Figuration: Masterworks From the Blake-Purnell Collection'' opened at the Guggenheim Bilbao in May 1998. Dr. Purnell had died in 1996.
        Dr. Blake is survived by two brothers, Arnold and Ernest, of Longmeadow, Mass.
