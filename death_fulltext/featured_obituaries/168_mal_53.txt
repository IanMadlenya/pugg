        Edward Mangum, a director and teacher who was a founder of Arena Stage in Washington, one of the nation's leading regional theaters, died on Wednesday in Austin, Tex., where he lived. He was 87.
        Mr. Mangum's career in theater began in 1947, shortly after he graduated from Catholic University with a master's degree in drama. After a short stint teaching at George Washington University, Mr. Mangum recruited his friends Zelda and Thomas Fichandler and raised some $15,000 to start a theater troupe.
        The company, housed in a former movie house, the Hippodrome, in the northwest section of Washington, immediately added vitality to a meager theater scene in the nation's capital. Arena's first performance, on Aug. 16, 1950, a production of ''She Stoops to Conquer,'' by Oliver Goldsmith, was directed by Mr. Mangum, as were nine other productions in the 1950-51 season.
        Mr. Mangum soon left Arena, however, for other directing projects overseas, eventually landing in Honolulu, where he ran a theater and continued directing. In the mid-1960's, he returned to the mainland, settling in Austin, where he helped establish a theater program at St. Edward's University, a school that had only minimal facilities at the time. While there, Mr. Mangum helped design and build the school's theater, a theater-in-the-round stage like the Arena.
        In 1982, Mr. Mangum retired from teaching but continued to live in Austin with his wife, Francisca. She is his only survivor.
