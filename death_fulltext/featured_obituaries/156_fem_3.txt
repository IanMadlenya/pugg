        Catherine M. Rae, a writer who published her first novel at 73, died on Dec. 25 at the Connecticut Hospice in Branford. She was 85 and lived in Guilford, Conn.
        Shortly after earning her Ph.D. at 65, Ms. Rae wrote her first book, ''Edith Wharton's New York Quartet,'' a work of literary criticism about the writer, who with Eudora Welty served as Ms. Rae's inspiration. The book was published in 1984.
        Her first attempt at fiction went unpublished after an editor at St. Martin's Press suggested it was beyond repair and she should write another.
        This resulted in ''Brownstone Facade,'' a mystery romance in the style and tone of her beloved Wharton set on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in 1920. It was published in 1988 and called ''a cozy, intelligent diversion'' by The New York Times.
        Seven other novels followed, among them ''Flight From Fifth Avenue'' and ''The Hidden Cove'' in 1995 and ''Sunlight on a Broken Column'' in 1997; an eighth is being edited for publication. Often set against the backdrop of fin de siecle New York society, her works frequently centered on a historical event like the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. Ms. Rae's literary papers -- she was an avid researcher -- will be donated to the Berg Collection at the New York Public Library.
        She was born in Manhattan and graduated from the Horace Mann School in 1931. She received a bachelor's degree from Barnard in 1935, a master's degree in teaching from Manhattanville College in 1970 and a Ph.D. in English literature from Denver University in 1979.
        Ms. Rae's husband, Gene, died on Nov. 13. She is survived by a son, David, of Ridgewood, N.J.; three daughters, Lucy Rae Ricciardi of Greenwich, Conn., Catherine Rae Reed of Littleton, Colo., and Mary Louise Rae Arnold of Fort Worth, and eight grandchildren.
