        Matthew R. Perkins, a co-founder of the Perkins Family Restaurants chain, died of heart disease Monday at Bethesda North Hospital. He was 79 years old.
        The chain, which Mr. Perkins and his brother began in 1958 from a pancake house in the Cincinnati suburb of Silverton, has grown to more than 390 restaurants nationwide, with sales last year of $450 million.
        Mr. Perkins sold his interest in the chain in 1978 but remained active in the 20-store Cincinnati franchise.
        His survivors include his wife, Marian; a daughter, three stepdaughters, a brother and a sister.
