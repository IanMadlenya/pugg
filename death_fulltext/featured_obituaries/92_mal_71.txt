        Jon Mensinger, a principal dancer with the Mark Morris Dance Group, died on Tuesday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. Mr. Mensinger was 37 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was AIDS, said Esther Rosenberg, a friend.
        Mr. Mensinger was a dancer of special delicacy with a heightened sense of the fine details of choreography. He was born in Euclid, Ohio. He trained in dance at Ohio State University and New York University and with teachers including Lee Theodore, Maggie Black and Jocelyn Lorenz. He performed with the Morris group from 1982 to 1991, and with American Dance Machine and Douglas Dunn and Dancers.
        Mr. Mensinger is survived by his mother, Bess Brock of London, Tenn.; his father, Johnny Singer of Cleveland; a sister, Monique O'Neil, also of Cleveland, and two brothers, Eric, of Los Angeles, and Kurt, of Austin, Tex.
