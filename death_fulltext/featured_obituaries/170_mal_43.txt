        Robert T. Howard, a president of the NBC television network from 1974 to 1977, died on Sunday in New York. He was 73.
        The cause was complications from heart disease, according to his daughter, Barbara Jo, of Manhattan.
        Mr. Howard, a native of Red Bank, N.J., worked at NBC for 33 years, starting out as a page. He helped negotiate acquisition of rights to the 1980 Olympics in Moscow, which NBC abandoned after the United States announced a boycott of the games in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
        In addition to his daughter, Mr. Howard is survived by his wife, Joan; three sons, Robert, of Murrells Inlet, S.C.; Gregory, of Guttenberg, N.J.; and Brian, of Baiting Hollow, N.Y.; and two grandchildren.
