        Sister Joseph Maria Scaglione, the director of the Grace Institute in Manhattan, died on Sept. 3 at the institute, where she lived. She was 63 years old.
        She died in her sleep, apparently of natural causes, the institute said.
        Sister Scaglione had worked as an educator since joining the Sisters of Mercy, a Roman Catholic order, in 1947.
        The order operates Grace Institute, which was founded by William Russell Grace and is now headed by his grandson, J. Peter Grace, the chairman of W. R. Grace & Company.
        The institute provides free occupational training, mostly for secretarial work, and other adult education, including nutrition, cooking and clothing classes, for women. It enrolls about 1,000 students a year.
        As the director, Sister Scaglione helped adapt the institute's program to the changing needs of the city's minority and immigrant women. She introduced new courses, including English as second language, and added night sessions and classes in the Bronx.
        Before working at Grace, Sister Joseph taught at St. Raymond's Academy and Spellman High School in the Bronx and was the director of St. Joseph's Academy in Greenwich Village.
        A native of New Jersey, she grew up in Manhattan and Queens. After graduating from the College of Mount St. Vincent, she earned a master's degree in business education from the College of St. Rose.
        Surviving are a brother and sister, Jack and Rosalie Scaglione, both of Queens.
        Correction:  September 26, 1992, Saturday
        An obituary on Sept. 12 on Sister Joseph Maria Scaglione, director of the Grace Institute in Manhattan, misidentified her Roman Catholic order. The order, which runs the institute, is the Sisters of Charity, not the Sisters of Mercy.
