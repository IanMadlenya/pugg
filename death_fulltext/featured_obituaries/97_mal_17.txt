        William Justice Strawbridge, a yachtsman and America's Cup financier who helped organize the Intrepid racing syndicate in 1967, died in his sleep yesterday at his home in Hobe Sound, Fla. He was 83 years old.
        His wife, Marjorie Flagg Strawbridge, said the apparent cause was heart failure.
        Mr. Strawbridge was an active sailor on Long Island Sound during the 1930's. He raced several yachts, including his own 12-Meter, Mitena, in regattas sponsored by the Larchmont Yacht Club.
        Years later, he contributed to America's Cup efforts for the 12-Meter American Eagle in 1964, and to all three campaigns for the 12-Meter Intrepid: 1967, 1970 and 1974. He was a lifetime member of the New York Yacht Club.
        Besides his wife, Mr. Strawbridge is survived by three sons, William Strawbridge Jr. of Easton, Md., Richard Vaux Strawbridge of Pottstown, Pa., and Norris Strawbridge of Charlestown, Mass.; two stepsons, John Finch of Fort Myers, Fla., and Francis Powers of Ardmore, Pa.; a half-brother, Samuel Morris of Pottstown, Pa., and five grandchildren.
