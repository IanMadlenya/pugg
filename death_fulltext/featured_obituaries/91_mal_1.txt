        James Wells Randolph, a lawyer and former Deputy Superintendent of the New York State Insurance Department, died on Wednesday at New York Hospital. He was 67 and lived in Mount Vernon, N.Y.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Randolph was born in Jersey City, graduated from Lincoln University in Pennsylvania and received a law degree from New York Law School. He had a private practice in Harlem before entering public service as an Assistant District Attorney in the Bronx, where he headed the indictments and narcotics bureaus.
        He subsequently worked at the New York City Department of Investigations as a Deputy Commissioner, and as Inspector General of the Board of Education. He was Deputy Superintendent of the Insurance Department from 1981 to 1988, overseeing the frauds and consumer-services bureaus as well as the real-estate bureau.
        Most recently, he practiced law in Manhattan part time.
        Mr. Randolph was active in the Presbyterian Church and the civil-rights movement and served as legal counsel during voter-registration drives in Mississippi in the 1960's.
        Mr. Randolph is survived by his wife of 42 years, Florence Hulin Randolph; two daughters, Dr. Paula Randolph-Edney of White Plains, and Leslie Randolph of Washington; a sister, Barbara Anne Merriweather of Hartsdale, N.Y., and two grandchildren.
