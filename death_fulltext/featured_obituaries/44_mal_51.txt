       Dr. Nathan Sugarman, a nuclear chemist who was a professor at the University of Chicago until he retired in 1987, died Thursday at the age of 73. His family said he died in an accident at his home in the Hyde Park section of Chicago.
        In World War II, Dr. Sugarman, then attached to the Manhattan Project under Enrico Fermi, was in charge of a group of chemists who determined the efficiency of the first nuclear explosion, conducted in Alamogordo, N. M. Dr. Sugarman was born in Chicago and received bachelor's and doctoral degrees from the University of Chicago. He became a research associate in the university's Metallurgical Laboratory in 1942 and went to the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in New Mexico in 1945.
        Returning to the university in 1946, he became a full professor in 1952. He received the university's Quantrell Award for excellence in undergraduate teaching in 1966.
        Dr. Sugarman is survived by his wife, the former Goldie Greenberg; a daughter, Tanya MacAloon of Evanston, Ill.; two sisters, Bernice Sugarman and Doris Manasse, both of Chicago, and three grandchildren.
