        William W. Rosenau, a Wall Street stock trading executive, died at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan on Thursday, his 63d birthday. He was a resident of White Plains.
        He died of heart failure, his family said.
        Since 1955 he worked at what is now Fowler, Rosenau, Geary & Safir, a firm co-founded by his late father, and he was a senior partner there for many years. The firm is a stock exchange floor specialist in several dozen stocks. He also served as a governor of the New York Stock Exchange from 1974 to 1980.
        His survivors include his wife, Jane; four daughters, Patricia and Susan, both of Manhattan, Ann, of Boston, and Carol Truncellito of Worcester, Mass.; and a brother, James, of Los Angeles.
