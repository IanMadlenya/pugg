        Joan Cullman, a Tony Award-winning producer on Broadway, died yesterday at her winter home in Tryall, Jamaica. She was 72 and also had homes in Manhattan and East Hampton, N.Y.
        The cause was a heart attack, said her daughter, Tracy Straus.
        Ms. Cullman was a producer of at least nine Broadway shows, including Yasmina Reza's ''Art,'' which won the Tony and New York Drama Critics Circle awards for best play in 1998.
        She was also a producer of several Tony-nominated plays and musicals, including David Hare's ''Skylight'' in 1996, ''Sweet Smell of Success'' in 2002 and ''The Play What I Wrote'' last year.
        Her other Broadway shows include ''The Rink,'' a musical written by Terrence McNally with music by John Kander and lyrics by Fred Ebb; Mr. Hare's ''Judas Kiss,'' and ''Carmelina.''
        Ms. Cullman was a vice chairwoman of the board of the Lincoln Center Theater and had served on the board there since 1985. At Lincoln Center she was the chairwoman of the patrons' committee and founded the Joan Cullman Award for Extraordinary Creativity, a cash prize that has been given to Tom Stoppard, Stockard Channing, Julie Taymor, Spalding Gray and others.
        Born Joan Paley in Far Rockaway, Queens, she graduated from Brooklyn College and began her career as an assistant to Stan Lee, the creator of ''Spider-Man'' and other comic books.
        Her marriage to Barnard Sachs Straus ended in divorce.
        Besides her daughter, she is survived by her husband Joseph F. Cullman III of Manhattan, the chairman emeritus of the Philip Morris Companies in New York; a son, Barney Straus Jr., of Evanston, Ill.; a brother, Leon Paley of Far Rockaway; and a grandson.
