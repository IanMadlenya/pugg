        Don Hall, a singer and songwriter who helped found People Taking Action Against AIDS, died on Thursday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. He was 44 and had homes in Manhattan and Bellport Village, L.I.
        The cause was AIDS, said his companion, Robert Starr.
        In 1986, Mr. Hall and a group of friends in Bellport banded together to raise money for AIDS research. Their organization, which became known as People Taking Action Against AIDS, has raised $10 million. In 1990, as part of the group's work, Mr. Hall organized Ads Against Aids, signing up advertising agencies to create print and broadcasting campaigns about AIDS.
        Mr. Hall was born in Jefferson, Tex. He graduated from Austin College in Sherman, Tex., in 1969. After a year of study at the Salzburg Conservatory in Salzburg, Austria, he began a career as a songwriter, singer and arranger in New York.
        In addition to Mr. Starr, he is survived by a sister, Ronnie Davis of Jackson, Miss., and a brother, John, of Linden, Tex.
