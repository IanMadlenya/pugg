        Ewing T. Kerr, a Federal district judge in Wyoming known for a ruling that Indians could regulate all liquor sales on their land, died Wednesday at De Paul Hospital in Cheyenne, Wyo. He was 92 years old and had lived in Cheyenne since 1925.
        The cause of his death was not known, said a granddaughter, Patricia Frey.
        Judge Kerr went on the bench in 1955 and was given senior status, with a reduced caseload, in 1975. He retired earlier this year. Upheld by High Court
        The judge's 1972 ruling, in United States v. Mazurie et al., was upheld in 1975 by the United States Supreme Court, which affirmed that Indian tribes had the authority to regulate liquor sales on their reservations.
        "That was an important recognition by the Supreme Court of tribal authority," John Echohawk, a member of the Pawnee tribe and executive director of the Native American Rights Fund, said in Boulder, Colo., yesterday.
        "There was some question about whether tribal governments could regulate the activities of non-Indians within reservation boundaries," Mr. Echohawk said, "and with help from Judge Kerr, the Supreme Court said very strongly that yes, indeed, tribal authority did reach non-Indians."
        Marvin J. Sinosky, a Washington lawyer who worked on behalf of the Indians, said that the case had grown out of a situation in which a place where liquor was sold had been operated by a non-Indian on a Wyoming reservation near an Indian settlement. He said there had been "a number of deaths in wintertime, with Indians being found on the highways frozen to death after being served liquor.
        Judge Kerr was born in Texas and educated in Oklahoma and Colorado, and he became a prosecutor in Wyoming. He married Irene Peterson in 1933. She died in 1989. He is survived by a son, Neal Kerr of Wenatchee, Wash.; a daughter, Judy Kerr of Dodge City, Kan.; two grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.
