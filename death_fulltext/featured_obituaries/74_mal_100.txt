        Donald B. Brewster, a photographer, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan at 56. The cause was complications of lung cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Brewster's work was published in newspapers and magazines and shown at the Louvre, the Smithsonian Institution, Nikon House and the Overseas Press Club, among others.
        His work often dealt with social issues. For the original Earth Day, he created a poster with the headline "Good to the Last Breath" that portrayed the planet with a giant gas mask strapped on. The poster is in the Museum of Modern Art's permanent collection.
        Mr. Brewster was a partner with his wife, Anna Lieber, in Lieber Brewster Corporate Design, which produces business publications, logos, advertising, promotions and exhibits. Previously he was a staff photographer for the Museum of Modern Art and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
        Early in his career he studied under Ansel Adams at Yosemite National Park, assisted Edward Steichen at the Museum of Modern Art and worked with Yousuf Karsh.
        Mr. Brewster was born in Toledo, Ohio, and was a graduate of Boston University. He served in the Army in Germany as a photographer.
        Besides his wife, his survivors include his mother, Mary Warren of Sylvania, Ohio, and a brother, Ronald, of Spring Valley, Minn.
