        William Mayo Sullivan, a New York insurance broker and longtime benefactor of classical music in the city, died on Tuesday at his home on the Upper East Side. He was 78.
        The cause was renal cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Sullivan was a past president of the Metropolitan Opera Club, which he joined in 1950.
        He also sat as an advisory director on the board of the Metropolitan Opera and was a vice president of the Bagby Foundation for the Musical Arts.
        Born in Brooklyn, Mr. Sullivan graduated from Georgetown University in 1943. He served as a lieutenant in the combat infantry and was severely wounded in an assault on a German machine-gun nest during the Normandy landing, in June 1944.
        Mr. Sullivan is survived by his wife of 26 years, Francoise Siebers Sullivan; a brother, Raymond P. Jr. of Scottsdale, Ariz.; and two sisters, Molly Sullivan and Katherine S. Meehan, both of Manhattan.
