        Dr. Jacob Landers, a teacher, principal and administrator at the New York City Board of Education for 34 years, died on Monday at New York University Hospital. He was 81.
        The cause was heart failure, said his daughter, Jane Landers.
        Dr. Landers began teaching in the city's schools in 1938, advancing to principal of Junior High School 64 in Brooklyn. In 1959 he was assigned by the Board of Education to write a report on racial integration problems. In 1963 he was named to a new post, that of assistant superintendent in charge of integration.
        In 1967 he became assistant superintendent for Federal and state-financed programs. During this period he was at the center of an almost continuous series of disputes among various ethnic groups on how best to integrate the public schools, and how best to pay for integration.
        In 1968 Dr. Landers had a heart attack and studied for a doctorate in education at New York University while he was recuperating. He left the school board in 1972 to teach at Pace University.
        In 1979, at the age of 66, he entered law school at N.Y.U. Three years later, at the age of 69, he became the oldest person to receive a law degree from the school.
        Dr. Landers is survived by his wife, Lucille Landers of Brooklyn; a son, Jonathan, of San Francisco, and his daughter, of Barrington, R.I.
