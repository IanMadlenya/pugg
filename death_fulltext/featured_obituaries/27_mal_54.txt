        Paul Grossinger, former co-owner of Grossinger's, the sprawling Catskills resort known for its kosher cuisine and borscht-belt humor, died yesterday at the Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. His death resulted from an automobile accident March 28 in Highland Falls, N.Y. Mr. Grossinger was 73 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Grossinger and his sister Elaine Grossinger Etess became owners of the resort in Sullivan County after their mother, Jennie, daughter of the founder, died in 1972.
        Eddie Fisher is reputed to have been discovered at Grossinger's by Eddie Cantor, who was a guest, and Rocky Marciano and other boxers trained.
        The hotel, once the second largest in the county, entertained 100,000 guests a year before closing in 1985. That year, it was sold to a group of New York investors, and it has not reopened.
        Mr. Grossinger, who was born in Liberty, N.Y., moved to Manhattan after the sale of the hotel and became active in charities, principally the Anti-Defamation League.
        In addition to his sister, Mr. Grossinger is survived by his wife, the former Ricelle Persky; three sons, James, Michael and Richard, and seven grandchildren.
