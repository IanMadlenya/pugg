        Walter J. Dilbeck Jr., a real estate developer and onetime business partner of Spiro T. Agnew who served a prison term for tax evasion, died Thursday at Deaconess Hospital in Evansville. He was 72 years old.
        He was admitted to the hospital on Tuesday with heart and kidney ailments, a brother said.
        Mr. Dilbeck was one of the nation's most decorated soldiers of World War II, during which he received two Distinguished Service Crosses, four Bronze Stars and four Purple Hearts. He was cited for singlehandedly holding off more than 200 German SS soldiers, killing or wounding 60, in a battle near Buchof, Germany.
        He was later involved in an ill-fated attempt to form a new baseball league. And a real-estate partnership with Mr. Agnew, who had resigned as Vice President in 1973, ended bitterly, with each accusing the other of exploitation.
        In 1976, Mr. Dilbeck pleaded guilty to filing a false Federal income tax return for 1969. He served 60 days in prison.
        He is survived by his wife of 52 years, Dorothy; 4 daughters, 11 grandchildren, 16 great-grandchildren, his mother and 7 brothers and sisters.
