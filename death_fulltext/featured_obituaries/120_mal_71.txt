        Arthur Solomon, a New York businessman and philanthropist, died on Jan. 12 at his retirement home in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. He was 77 and a former resident of Manhattan.
        The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease, his family said.
        Mr. Solomon, a Bronx native, was a past vice chairman and charter board member of the Burden Center for the Aging in Manhattan.
        He also owned a letter shop that he  built into a lithographic printing and computerized direct-mail concern.
        Mr. Solomon is survived by his wife, the former Edna Herrmann; a son, Daniel, of Manhattan; a daughter, Janet Randall, of Great Neck, L.I.; a sister, Harriet Weber of Pompano, Fla., and four grandchildren.
