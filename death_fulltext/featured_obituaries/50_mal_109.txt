        Sidney Danziger, a leader in the metals-recycling industry, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 87 years old.
        He died of complications of diabetes, an associate said.
        Mr. Danziger was a past president of the National Association of Recycling Industries. He was the founder of the Alloys and Chemicals Corporation, a Cleveland-based recycling company that he sold in 1961.
        He then founded Dison Metals in Manhattan, a company that deals in nonferrous metals. He was an adviser to many foreign and domestic government agencies and was active in philanthropic causes. He helped establish the Sidney and Gloria Danziger Day Care Center in Neva Hanna, Israel.
        His wife, Gloria, died last year. He is survived by several nieces and nephews.
