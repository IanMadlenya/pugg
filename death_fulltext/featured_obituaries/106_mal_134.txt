        Leon Zitrone, a popular news broadcaster on French television for 30 years, died of a brain hemorrhage on Saturday. He was 81.
        Mr. Zitrone, who was born in Russia, became a household name as a news anchor in the 1960's, when television was still a novelty for millions of French families. The events he covered over the years included the annual Bastille Day parade, de Gaulle's funeral and the marriage of the Prince of Wales to Lady Diana Spencer. He also commented on sports events, including the Tour de France cycling race, horse racing and figure skating, and was known for improvised interviews, genial rather than combative, with political figures.
