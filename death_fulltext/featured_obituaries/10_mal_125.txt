        Former Gov. Haydon Burns, who served a special two-year term in the 1960's, died Sunday at Regents Park Nursing Home here. He was 75 years old and lived in Jacksonville.
        Mr. Burns won election to the shortened term in 1964 after 15 years as Mayor of Jacksonville. Normally, Florida's governor serves for four years, but the term was shortened to insure that the Florida gubernatorial elections would not fall in the same years as Presidential races.
        He lost a bid for re-election in 1966 in a bitterly contested Democratic primary against Miami Mayor Robert King High. Mr. High went on to lose the general election to Claude Kirk, who became the first Republican Governor of Florida in 94 years.
        It was during Mr. Burns's term that Walt Disney decided to locate Disney World in Orlando, a move that helped insure Florida's strength as a tourist spot.
        Mr. Burns also helped establish the Board of Regents for the state university system and helped create the University of West Florida in Pensacola, Florida Technological University in Orlando and the College of Law at Florida State University in Tallahassee.
        After his defeat in 1966, Mr. Burns returned to Jacksonville as a business and public relations consultant and made one last stab at public office in 1971, losing a mayoral race against Hans Tanzler.
        A native of Chicago, he had moved to Jacksonville when he was 10.
        He is survived by his wife, Mildred, a son, a daughter and five grandchildren.
