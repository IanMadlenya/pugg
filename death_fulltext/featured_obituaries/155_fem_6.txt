        Eleanor Brussel, the founder and former director of the Horace Mann School for Nursery Years in Manhattan, died on Sunday at her home in Riverdale, the Bronx. She was 94.
        Mrs. Brussel spent five decades in the company of preschoolers, founding several schools and a camp for them. She married young and got interested in the field when her two sons were toddlers.
        A native of Manhattan, she received the equivalent of a bachelor's degree in 1924 and joined the administration of the Harriet Johnson Nursery School on Bank Street, affiliated with what was then the Cooperative School for Education, now the Bank Street College of Education.
        She became director of the school, and when Bank Street College decided to close it, she moved it to East 90th Street under a new name, the New York School for Nursery Years. It merged with the Horace Mann School in 1968, acquiring its current name and a reputation as one of the first steps on the road to an Ivy League college.
        She retired as director in 1982.
        Mrs. Brussel is survived by her two sons, Charles A. Reich of San Francisco and Dr. Peter Reich of Belmont, Mass.; two stepdaughters, Valerie Levy of Sydney, Australia, and Margery Manber of Scarsdale, N.Y.; six grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. Her first marriage, to Dr. Carl Reich, who is now dead, ended in divorce. Her second husband, George Brussel Jr., died in 1961.
