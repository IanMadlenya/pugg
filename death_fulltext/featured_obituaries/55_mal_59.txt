        James E. (Scoops) Cooney, who in 1927 made the last unassisted triple play in the National League, died on Wednesday in a Warwick nursing home. The nursing home said Mr. Cooney, who was 96 years old, had died of natural causes.
        Mr. Cooney was playing shortstop for the Chicago Cubs when he made his triple play, which came in the fourth inning of the first game of a doubleheader on May 30, 1927, at Pittsburgh. With runners on first and second, Paul Waner hit a line drive up the middle. Mr. Cooney broke from his position, caught the ball, touched second for the second out and tagged the runner coming from first base for the third out.
        The unassisted triple play was one of only nine in major league history. Two years before he accomplished the feat, Mr. Cooney was one of the runners called out when Glenn Wright of the Pirates pulled off the play.
        Mr. Cooney, whose brother and father also played major league baseball, played for six teams in his seven-year career, which ended in 1928. He had a career batting average of .262.
