        Edward L. Johnson, a former Foreign Service officer and a lawyer who was an authority on ship financing, died on Monday at his home in Larchmont, N.Y. He was 69.
        Mr. Johnson died of heart failure, said a son, Christopher L. Johnson of Columbus, Ohio.
        Mr. Johnson was born in 1923 in Schenectady, N.Y. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Union College in 1943 before enlisting in the Army, where he deciphered Japanese-language codes.
        He joined the Foreign Service in 1946. His posting that year as vice consul in the United States Embassy in Colombo, Ceylon, made him one of the youngest Foreign Service officers ever appointed.
        He resigned from the Foreign Service in 1949 to enroll in Harvard Law School. He graduated in 1952 and joined the New York City firm of Haight, Gardner, Poor & Havens, where he spent his entire legal career.
        In 1964, Mr. Johnson was named a partner at the firm, which specialized in international maritime and aviation law. He was a senior partner at the time of his death. Mr. Johnson's field was ship financing, and he often helped to draft revisions of its laws.
        In addition to his son, Christopher, Mr. Johnson is survived by his wife, the former Blanche Haesly; a son, Mark E., of Short Hills, N.J., and two grandchildren.
