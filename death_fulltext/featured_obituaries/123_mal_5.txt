        Edward Ranzal, a reporter at The New York Times for 45 years, from the mid-1930's until 1979, died on Tuesday at a nursing home in Tamarack, Fla. He was 83 and had lived in Deerfield Beach, Fla., since his retirement.
        He died after a brief illness, his family said.
        Mr. Ranzal was born in New York City and attended City College, but quit in 1931, during the Depression, when he took a $14-a-week job as a copy boy at The Times. Three years later, on the strength of some feature articles he wrote, he was promoted to the metropolitan staff as a reporter.
        His first assignments were to cover police news and other news in midtown Manhattan, including major fires, crimes and disasters. He later wrote about municipal affairs and also covered borough courts and the State Supreme Court.
        During the 1950's, he reported from Federal Court in Foley Square, covering the Rosenberg spy trial. He also covered some hearings of the Senate Permanent Investigating subcommittee headed by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy and the indictment of Roy M. Cohn on Federal fraud and conspiracy charges in 1968.
        His wife of more than 50 years, Celia Greenberg Ranzal, died a year ago. He is survived by two sons, Ted, of Manchester Center, Vt., and Gerry, of New City, N.Y., and four grandchildren.
