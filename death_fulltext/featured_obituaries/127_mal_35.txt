        Alexander Cordell, the author of the best-selling 1959 novel ''Rape of the Fair Country,'' about Welsh iron-workers and their struggle for union rights at the turn of the century, was found dead on July 9 near Llangollen, Denbighshire, in Wales, The Independent, the British newspaper, reported. Mr. Cordell who lived in Wrexham, Wales, was 82.
        The newspaper said his body had been discovered in a stream, clutching family photographs. He had been suffering from heart trouble, said friend, John Barnes, of Brooklyn Heights.
        Mr. Cordell was the author of 28 novels, most of them well-researched historical yarns. He was named George Alexander Graber when he was born in Colombo, Ceylon, now Sri Lanka. The son of a soldier, he served in the British Army during World War II.
        Mr. Cordell first settled in Wales in 1950, working as a surveyor in Monmouthshire. There he heard stories of the lives of the Welsh ironworkers and the impact of the industrial revolution on the region.
        The novels that followed showed a love of the harsh landscape and spirited men and women of the Welsh valleys. With their action, suspense and romance, these works were sometimes compared to those of the American writer Howard Fast. Mr. Cordell's best-known novel, ''The Rape of the Fair Country,'' was described by Orville Prescott in The New York Times as ''strange, beautiful and moving.''
        Mr. Cordell published his last novel, ''Send Her Victorious,'' in June.
        He was married twice, and is survived by a daughter, Georgiana Karkonen of Joensier, Finland, and five grandchildren.
