        Roy London, an actor, a director and a playwright who was also a leading acting coach, died on Sunday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 50.
        The cause was lymphoma, said his companion, Tim Healey.
        Early in his career Mr. London made more than 150 appearances onstage and in television and films. His Broadway credits include the 1969 production of Lanford Wilson's play "The Gingham Dog," in which he starred with Diana Sands and George Grizzard. Off Broadway in 1974, he appeared in the Manhattan Theater Club revival of S. N. Behrman's "End of Summer." He also appeared with the Hartford Stage Company, the Center Stage in Baltimore and the Antioch Shakespeare Festival.
        Mr. London also wrote for the stage and screen. His play "Mrs. Murray's Farm," a comedy set in Manhattan during the Revolutionary War, was produced by the Circle Repertory Company in 1976. His screenplays included one made into an NBC television movie, "California Gold Rush," and the 1988 feature film "Tiger Warsaw," with Piper Laurie and Patrick Swayze.
        He made his debut as director of a feature film last year with "Diary of a Hit Man," which starred Forest Whitaker and Sharon Stone. He also directed episodes of "It's Garry Shandling's Show" for Showtime and "The Larry Sanders Show" for HBO.
        Mr. London was a private coach for many well-known actors, among them Geena Davis, Jeff Goldblum, Mr. Swayze and Michelle Pfeiffer.
        In addition to Mr. Healey, a producer, he is survived by his mother, Frances, and a brother, Chuck, both of New York City.
