        James Abbe, a photographer who became an American folk art expert and dealer, died on Oct. 7 at his home in Brookville, N.Y. He was 87.
        Mr. Abbe, who was born in Lynchburg, Va., began his career in the early 1930's as an assistant to his father, the pioneering photographer James Abbe Sr., who had a studio in Paris. He then returned to the United States and worked for Harper's Bazaar. In 1936 he opened a studio in Manhattan and his work began appearing in publications like McCall's.
        In 1961 Mr. Abbe turned from taking photographs to pursuing Americana. In New York he opened antiques stores in East Hampton and Oyster Bay, and became a dealer in folk art, Shaker furniture and whaling artifacts. He also collected materials on photography's history.
        He is survived by his wife, Kathryn; three sons, James, of New York, Thomas, of Brookville, and Eli, of Palo Alto, Calif., and a daughter, Lucinda, of Jackson Hole, Wyo.
