        Dr. Bernard H. Perlman, who practiced medicine in Manhattan for more than 50 years and was a member of the New York City Board of Health from 1978 to 1982, died on Tuesday at Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 83.
        The cause was lung cancer, said his son, Philip K. Perlman.
        During his career Dr. Perlman served on the teaching staffs of many hospitals in New York City, and at the time of his death he was a clinical assistant at Mount Sinai. A graduate of the Downstate Medical Center in 1934, he was president of the New York Cardiological Society from 1973 to 1974.
        He is survived by his companion of 10 years, Vivian Weiden, and two sons, Philip K. and Richard J., all of Manhattan.
