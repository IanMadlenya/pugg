        Maury P. Medwick, an artist and chemist who developed several widely used adhesives and other synthetic compounds, died on Monday at his home in Larchmont, N.Y. He was 81 years old.
        He died of natural causes, his daughter said.
        A native of Brooklyn, Mr. Medwick attended Columbia University and later studied at Pratt Institute.
        During World War II, Mr. Medwick, as the owner of an adhesive products company and a member of the War Production Board's Technical Advisory Committee, developed substitute adhesives that manufacturers could use instead of rubber and other strictly rationed materials.
        He also invented Monzini, a synthetic casting compound used by many museums in dinosaur skeletons and other exhibits and by sculptors and make-up artists. Mr. Medwick was also a sculptor.
        He was a founder of the Larchmont Temple, in Larchmont, and also helped organize and contributed to the Strait Gate Church, in Mamaroneck, N.Y.
        Mr. Medwick's first wife, Lucille, died in 1971. He is survived by his wife, Shirley; three daughters, Patricia Sherman, of Stephentown, N.Y., Susan Egen, of Tucson, Ariz., and Kathleen Medwick Silberman, of Somers, N.Y.; two sisters, Anne Mintz, of Mamaroneck, N.Y., and Minna Kane, of Montrose, N.Y.; seven grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
