        Preston (Patch) Caradine, a founder of Serendipity 3, the whimsical East Side ice-cream parlor-restaurant-boutique, died on Monday at St. Vincent's Hospital.  He was 69 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer, said Jan Ferrell, his friend and former stage partner.
        A native of Marvell, Ark., Mr. Caradine graduated from Little Rock Junior College. He came to New York in the 1940's and worked for United Press and later at Dutton publishers.
        A noted wordsmith, he became co-creator and a partner in a comedy act, "Patch & Jan," which was part of an Off Broadway revue and played a popular supper club in the early 1950's. In September 1954, he joined Stephen Bruce and Calvin L. Holt in founding Serendipity 3 as a funky, innovative antidote to Schrafft's. Serendipity 3 marks its 40th anniversary this year
        He retired from the business 25 years ago. According to Mr. Bruce, Mr. Caradine contributed flair and style to their enterprise as well as the name, which he culled from a crossword puzzle in The Times of London. He also brought  along southern family recipes, Mr. Bruce said, like the cafe's famous Aunt Buba's sand tarts, an incredibly buttery pecan cookie.
        Serendipity, on East 60th Street, developed a faithful following of adults, children, tourists and celebrities. A prototype for similarly quirky establishments, it has outlived most of them.
        Mr. Holt, a fellow Arkansan, died three years ago, leaving Mr. Bruce as the owner. Since relinquishing his share in the business, Mr. Caradine devoted himself to writing material for comedy acts and traveling, Ms. Ferrell said.
        He is survived by a sister, Fredona Cohen of Little Rock.
