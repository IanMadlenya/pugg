        Rabbi Hershel Cohen, a Talmudic scholar and the spiritual leader of Ahawas Achim B'nai Jacob synagogue in Newark for several decades, died of congestive heart failure last Friday at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J. He was 89 years old and a resident of Livingston.
        Rabbi Cohen, who was born in Byelorussia, was descended from a long line of Orthodox rabbis. At the age of 12, he was sent to study in Lithuania, where his forebears had taught, and he was a graduate of the largest yeshiva, Slutzk and Stuchin, there.
        Upon his arrival in the United States in 1923, he settled in Newark as spritual leader of B'nai Jacob. He retired when the congregation moved to West Orange in the early 1960's and merged with others to become Ahawas Achim B'nai Jacob and David.
        Rabbi Cohen remained active, continuing to preach and counsel. During his career he performed more than 4,000 weddings. Two years ago he was honored for a half-century of dedicated service to the synagogue.
        He is survived by two daughters, Zipporah Listokin of Brooklyn and Marcia Solomon of Teaneck, N.J.; a son, Joel, of Livingston; 13 grandchildren and 28 great-grandchildren.
