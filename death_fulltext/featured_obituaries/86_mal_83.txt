        Lewis W. Shollenberger, a wire service and broadcast journalist in Washington for 20 years, and a former director of Radio Liberty for three years, died on Tuesday at the Meadow Lakes Health Center in Hightstown, N.J., where he lived. He was 77.
        The cause was Alzheimer's disease, said his daughter, Carol Del Grosso.
        Starting in the early 1940's, Mr. Shollenberger worked in Washington as a reporter for the old United Press news agency, then as a correspondent for CBS and finally as a news director at ABC. Between 1963 and 1966 he was the executive director of Radio Liberty in Munich. He later worked in Washington for the Small Business Administration and the Advertising Council.
        Mr. Shollenberger is survived by his daughter, of Old Bethpage, L.I.; and a brother, Joseph H., of Pinehurst, N.C.
