        John G. Friend, a retired chairman and former director of NBD Chicago Bank, died Friday at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. He was 58 years old and lived in Winnetka, Ill., and Rancho Mirage, Calif.
        Mr. Friend died of prostate cancer, said his wife, Abby Mandel.
        A native of Chicago, Mr. Friend graduated from Brown University in 1956 and joined the Greenbaum Tanning Company in Chicago, a business founded by his grandfather.
        After the company was liquidated in 1957, Mr. Friend worked in sales at the Nachmann Company, a bedding spring company, until the early 1960's when he joined the Marina Bank. He rose to become its president, and when it merged with NBD Chicago Bank in the late 1960's, he became director and chairman of the new company.
        Since 1988, when his cancer was diagnosed, Mr. Friend had been very active in the broader fight against the disease. At his death he was chairman of the development committee of the Robert H. Lurie Cancer Center at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and had founded the John and Abby Friend Professorship in clinical oncology at Northwestern University.
        Mr. Friend was also a trustee of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
        In addition to his wife, a food columnist for The Chicago Tribune, he is survived by a daughter, Pamela Szokol, of Highland Park, Ill.; two sons, William Friend of Chicago and Scott Friend of Boston; a stepdaughter, Holly Friend of Chicago; his parents, Kurt and Lorayne Friend, of Palm Springs and Rancho Mirage, Calif.; a brother, Kenneth Friend of New Orleans, and one granddaughter.
