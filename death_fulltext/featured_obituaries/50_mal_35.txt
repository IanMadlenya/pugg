        Roger G. Weill, a stamp dealer and collector who once owned some of the world's most expensive stamps, died Saturday at Touro Infirmary in New Orleans. He was 81 years old and lived in New Orleans.
        Mr. Weill died of esophageal cancer, his brother, Raymond, said.
        Mr. Weill and his brother were co-owners of the Raymond H. Weill Company, a stamp dealer based in the French Quarter of New Orleans. In 1989 a British bank, Hambros Bank Ltd., bought out their inventory for more than $10 million. The property was later sold by Christie's, the art auctioneers.
        In 1963, in one of his best-known acquisitions, Mr. Weill paid $71,000 for a pair of rare stamps from Bermuda at an auction. Known to philatelists as "cotton reels" because of their resemblance to the labels on spools of thread, the 2-cent stamps, issued in 1851, were among the world's most valuable.
        Mr. Weill was born in St. Louis and moved to New Orleans at the age of 12. His father encouraged the brothers to collect stamps, and the hobby was to become their vocation.
        Mr. Weill is survived by two brothers, Raymond and George A., of New Orleans.
        Correction:  March 7, 1991, Thursday, Late Edition - Final
        Because of an editing error, an obituary on Tuesday about Roger G. Weill, a stamp dealer, referred incorrectly in some copies to the British colony that issued a pair of rare stamps he bought. It was British Guiana, not Bermuda.
