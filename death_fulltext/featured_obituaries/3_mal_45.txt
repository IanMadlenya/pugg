        The cause of death of Mr. Dassler, whose parents founded the company, was not announced.
        Mr. Dassler had led Adidas since the death in December 1984 of his mother, Kathe Dassler, who took over the company after her husband, Adolf Dassler, died in 1978. The company's headquarters are in Herzogenaurach, 14 miles from Nuremberg.
        Adolf Dassler began producing the athletic shoes that eventually made the company famous in 1920, although they did not carry the Adidas brand name until the late 1940's.
