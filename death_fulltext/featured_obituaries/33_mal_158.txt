        Rear Adm. Edward J. Fahy, a World War II submarine officer and later chief of the Navy's Bureau of Ships, died of cardiac arrest yesterday in Delray Beach, Fla., where he lived in retirement. He was 79 years old.
        In 1944, as the commanding officer of the submarine Plunger, he earned two Navy Commendation Medals for his combat service in the Pacific.
        As a staff officer in the Pacific submarine command, he supervised tests of new devices to increase the offensive and defensive capabilities of submarines and their ability to rescue fliers downed at sea. For this service he was awarded the Legion of Merit.
        In 1953 Admiral Fahy was named to head the Navy's Underwater Sound Laboratory in New London, Conn., and in 1961 he became commander of the Mare Island Naval Shipyard in California before heading the Bureau of Ships, later the Naval Ships Systems Command, in Washington.
        Admiral Fahy, a past president of the American Society of Naval Engineers, was graduated from the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md., in 1934 and served in China and the Philippines before World War II.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Cecilia Finn; a son, Comdr. Edward J. Fahy Jr. of Jacksonville, Fla.; four daughters, Elizabeth Weeks of Fairfax, Va., Antoinette Gaylord of Coronado, Calif., Kathleen Wagner of Arlington, Va., and Bridget Flint of Alexandria, Va., and eight grandchildren.
