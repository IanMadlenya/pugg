        Malcolm A. Birnbaum, a leader in the financing of independently produced movies, died on Tuesday at his summer home in Old Greenwich, Conn. He was 48 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Birnbaum helped arrange the financing for about 80 feature films for theatrical distribution, including "The Postman Always Rings Twice," "The Chosen," "Cotton Club" and "Never Say Never Again."
        Traditional lenders, accustomed to dealing with large movie studios, often shunned independent films, but Mr. Birnbaum recognized them as a growing segment in the entertainment industry.
        From 1979 to 1984, he worked at Chemical Bank, where he was a vice president in its entertainment industries division.
        For the next several years he worked for United Artists as the senior vice president and chief financial officer of its cable television subsidiary and vice president of the parent company, United Artists Entertainment, which included films.
        In 1989-90, he was the executive vice president of Independent Production Resources, then worked as a private consultant. In 1992, he became the vice president and chief operating officer of Coment Funding Corporation in Manhattan, which finances communications and entertainment ventures, mostly films.
        Mr. Birnbaum was born in Brooklyn. He graduated from New York University and earned a master's degree in business administration at Fordham.
        His first marriage ended in divorce.
        His survivors include his wife of seven years, Linsey Tully; his mother, Beatrice Kolton, of Queens; a son, Scott, of Maplewood, N.J.; two daughters, Kelly Ann Birnbaum, of Manhattan, and Amy Birnbaum, of Maplewood, N.J., and a brother, Howard Miles, of Plano, Tex.
