        Rodney D. Andrews Jr., an expert in the chemistry of polymers, died on Oct. 19 at St. Mary's Hospital in Hoboken, N.J. He was 71 and lived in Weehawken.
        The cause was complications from heart disease, said a spokesman for the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, where Mr. Andrews had continued his research as an emeritus professor since 1991.
        Before retiring, Mr. Andrews was a professor of chemistry at the Stevens Institute and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
        In the 1940's, he was one of a small number of chemists who concentrated on the emerging field of polymers, long-chain molecules that are now widely used in plastics, fibers and thousands of other materials. Studied at Princeton
        He received his bachelor's degree, master's degree and Ph.D. from Princeton, where he wrote his doctoral thesis on the viscoelasticity of polymers and studied under Prof. Alfred V. Tobolsky, a pioneer in polymer research.
        After doing postgraduate research at the University of Basel in Switzerland, Mr. Andrews joined Dow Chemical Company in the late 1950's, participating in research on the optical and mechanical properties of polymers at Dow's laboratories in Midland, Mich. From 1958 to 1959, he was editor of the Transactions of the Society of Rheology.
        In 1961, he became an assistant professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and in 1965 he joined the Stevens Institute as a professor of chemistry. He was named professor emeritus in 1991.
        In 1985, he joined five other scientists at the Stevens Institute in a two-year study of the ethical problems arising from the use of advanced computer technology. Their findings were compiled in "The Information Web: Ethical and Social Implications of Computer Networking," a book published in 1988 by Westview Press of Boulder, Colo.
        He is survived by his sister, Virginia Fuller of Centerville, Ohio.
