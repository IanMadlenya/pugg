        Hans Herlin, a best-selling German novelist, died on Tuesday at his home in Southern France. He was 68.
        The cause was a heart attack, a family spokesman said.
        Mr. Herlin's best-known novel was "Commentaries," published in the United States in 1975 by St. Martin's Press. Set in Germany in 1969, it tells the story of a photographer who receives an assignment that draws him into the wartime horrors committed by the Nazis.
        Among his other books were "Solo Run" (1983), about an aging West German intelligence operative, and "The Last Spring in Paris" (1985), an espionage thriller set in Paris in the month before the Allied invasion of Normandy.
        He is survived by his wife, Marie Naudin, and by a son and daughter from a previous marriage.
