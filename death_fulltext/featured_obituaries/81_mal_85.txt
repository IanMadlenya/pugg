        Dr. Paul J. Chapman, professor emeritus of entomology at Cornell University's New York State Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, N.Y., died Oct. 6 at his Geneva home. He was 93.
        He was active at the station until just days ago, a Cornell representative said.
        Dr. Chapman was a native of Cazadero, Calif., graduated from Oregon State University and received his doctorate in entomology from Cornell in 1928. He joined the faculty in 1930.
        He was chairman of the department of entomology at Geneva from 1948 until 1967, the year before he officially reached emeritus status.
