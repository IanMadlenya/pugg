        Karl Einstein, a retired New Jersey businessman, died on Sunday at Wayne General Hospital in New Jersey. He was 69 years old and lived in Wayne.
        He died of a heart attack, his wife, the former Hazel Lorraine Daugherty, said.
        He was the owner of Gold Star Appliance Service, a home-appliance company that he founded in 1976. He retired in the early 1980's because of illness.
        Mr. Einstein was born in Frankfurt, Germany. He came to the United States in 1937 at the age of 16, and served in the United States Army from 1942 to 1945, becoming a staff sergeant. After the war he brought his parents and two brothers to the United States from France, where they had fled from Frankfurt.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by two brothers, Ernst, of Mountainside, N.J., and Theodore, of Mendham, N.J.
