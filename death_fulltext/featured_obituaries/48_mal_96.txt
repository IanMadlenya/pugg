        Bernard B. Schlanger, professor emeritus of speech and audiology at the City University of New York, died on Wednesday at Palm Beach Gardens Hospital in Florida. He was 75 years old and lived in Palm Beach Gardens.
        He died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, said his wife, the former Phoenig Honig, professor emeritus of speech at Lehman College in the Bronx.
        Professor Schlanger taught at several universities and colleges, including Brooklyn, Marietta, Wisconsin, West Virginia and Ohio State. From 1967 to 1980, when he retired, he taught speech and audiology at City University.
        Professor Schlanger helped develop language-training programs for the mentally retarded. President John F. Kennedy appointed him speech and hearing consultant to a national commission on mental retardation.
        A native of Newark, he graduated from the University of Wisconsin, where he also received an M.A. and a Ph.D. He served in the Signal Corps in World War II.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by three sons, Harley, of Houston, Dr. Larry, of Palm Beach Gardens, and Michael, of Grosse Pointe Park, Mich.; two sisters, Nettie Baum of Camarillo, Calif., and Marian Cole of Largo, Fla., and a grandson.
