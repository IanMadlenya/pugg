        Kateb Yacine, a leading Algerian novelist, poet and playwright, died of leukemia on Saturday in Grenoble, France. He was 60 years old.
        Mr. Yacine died at La Tranche Hospital, where he had gone for treatment of his illness, the Algerian state news agency said.
        Mr. Yacine, an active supporter of Algeria's war for independence from France in the 1950's, first became known for his novel ''Nedjma,'' an extended love poem to the title character, a woman who incarnates the Algerian revolution.
        He wrote novels and poems in French, but since 1970 had written mainly for the theater. His best-known play was ''Mohammed, Get Your Suitcase,'' a story dealing with large-scale Algerian emigration to France.
