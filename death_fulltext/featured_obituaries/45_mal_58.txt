        Sheik Rashid bin Said al-Maktum, co-founder of the United Arab Emirates and ruler of Dubai, died today, the state television announced. Reference works say he was born in 1914, but a family member said he was 84 years old.
        Officials said Sheik Rashid had been near death for about four years. The official cause of his death was not disclosed. [Reuters said he had suffered a series of strokes in recent years.]  Sheik Rashid was Vice President and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates, the federation of sheikdoms that includes Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharja, Ras al-Khaima, Ajman, Umm al-Qaiwain, and Fujaira.
        He founded the federation in 1971 with his brother-in-law, Sheik Said bin Sultan al-Nahyan, the ruler of Abu Dhabi and now President of the federation. The seven sheikdoms, which stretch from Qatar to Oman along the Persian Gulf, previously had been ruled together as the Trucial States under an agreement with the British.
        Sheik Rashid is survived by four sons. The eldest is the Crown Prince, Sheik Maktum bin Rashid al-Maktum, who is to succeed his father as ruler of the emirate. Another son, Sheik Mohammed al-Rashid, is the federation's Defense Minister, while Sheik Hamdan al-Rashid is Minister of Finance and Industry.
