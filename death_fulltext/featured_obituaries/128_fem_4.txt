        Angenette Martin, who specialized in grass-roots organizing and consulting for political campaigns and others, died last Saturday at her home in Sausalito, Calif. She was 50.
        The cause was breast cancer, according to Martin & Glantz, her consulting firm, founded in 1985.
        Born in Hartford, Ms. Martin graduated from Wells College in Aurora, N.Y., in 1968 with a degree in sociology. Her first work as an organizer was for Ralph Nader, running field operations for the Connecticut Citizen Action Group in the early 1970's.
        She worked for the campaigns of  former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, among others, as well as Congressional and governor's races in several states, including New Jersey and New York. As a partner in Martin & Glantz, she helped organize the 1986 Hands Across America campaign to arouse awareness about hunger and homelessness.
        She is survived by her husband, Eugene Eidenberg; two stepdaughters, Elizabeth Eidenberg of Los Angeles and Danielle E. Noppe of Seattle; her mother, Angenette Vail Martin of West Hartford, Conn.; and two brothers, Erle Martin Jr. of Albany, Ga., and Steve T. Martin of Briarcliff, N.Y.
