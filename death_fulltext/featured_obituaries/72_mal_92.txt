        James R. McCallum, the publisher of the Musical America International Directory of the Performing Arts, died on Monday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. He was 48 and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of a brain tumor, said his brother, John T. McCallum.
        Mr. McCallum joined Musical America in 1982, as associate publisher and advertising director for both the annual edition -- a comprehensive listing of musicians, managers, orchestras, festivals, opera companies, publications and other musical organizations -- and the Musical America magazine, which was printed every two months until last January when it folded. He became the publisher of both in 1990.
        Before he joined Musical America, Mr. McCallum was a sales representative for Herbert Barrett Management and a publicity director for Columbia Artists Management, both musical-management concerns.
        Mr. McCallum was born in Alliance, Ohio. He received a bachelor's degree in music education from Westminster Choir College in Princeton, N.J., in 1967, and a Master of Fine Arts from Brooklyn College in 1981. He was a public school teacher in Madison and Middletown Townships in New Jersey from 1967 to 1973.
        In addition to his brother, of Redwood City, Calif., he is survived by his parents, Ross William and Marjorie McCallum of Alliance.
