        The Rev. Gereon Lindsay, chaplain at Harlem Valley Psychiatric Center in Wingdale, N.Y., and a member of the Capuchin Franciscan Order, died on Monday at Danbury Hospital in Connecticut. He was 74 years old and lived at Our Lady of Solace Friary on the center's grounds.
        He died of emphysema, a spokesman for the order said.
        He had been chaplain at the center since 1970. From 1962 to 1970 he was associate pastor at Sacred Heart Parish in Yonkers and a teacher in the parish high school. Earlier he was a member of the staff of St. Francis Chapel in Springfield, Mass., and pastor of various parishes including Our Lady Queen of the Angels in East Harlem.
        A native New Yorker, Father Lindsay was ordained a priest in 1943.
        He is survived by a sister, Sister Kathleen Lindsay of the Dominican Order in New Hyde Park, N.Y.
