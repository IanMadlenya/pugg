        Irving E. Press, the retired chairman of the J. Press clothing company, which was a pioneer in upscale men's fashion, died on Friday at the Texas Heart Institute. He was 87 and lived in Palm Beach, Fla., after many years in Manhattan.
        The cause was complications following surgery, said a son, Michael Press.
        Born and raised in New Haven, Mr. Press graduated from Yale in 1926 and its law school in 1928, then practiced law in New York for a brief period.
        He then joined his brother, Paul Press, and their father, Jacobi Press, who had founded the J. Press store in New Haven in 1902, in developing a line of natural-looking men's clothing.
        J. Press featured jackets with sloping shoulders and trousers with plain fronts that became known as the Ivy League look. The look became nationally popular, evolving into almost a uniform for professional men and business executives, and the New Haven store expanded with branches in other cities on the East Coast.
        In 1986 the company, which Mr. Press then served as chairman of the board, was purchased by Onward Kashiyama, a Tokyo clothing manufacturer. Mr. Press is survived by two sons, Michael of Oyster Bay, L.I., and Thomas of Houston; his brother, of New Haven; a sister, Marion O'Brasky, also of New Haven, and three grandchildren.
