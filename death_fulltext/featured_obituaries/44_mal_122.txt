        Charles Arnt, a character actor in more than 200 films, died on Aug. 6 at his home on Orcas Island, Wash. He was 83 years old.
        He died of pancreatic and liver cancer, a family spokesman said yesterday.
        His films, made between 1934 and 1962, included ''Remember the Night,'' ''Blossoms in the Dust,'' ''Ball of Fire,'' ''My Gal Sal,'' ''Take a Letter Darling,'' ''Miss Susie Slagle's,'' ''My Favorite Brunette,'' ''Sitting Pretty,'' ''Wild in the Country'' and ''Sweet Bird of Youth.''
        Mr. Arnt gave up acting and began importing and breeding French Charolais cattle at his ranch on Orcas Island in 1962.
        He was a native of Michigan City, Ind., and a graduate of Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., and Princeton University, at which he was the president of the Triangle Club and a founder of the University Players, with Margaret Sullavan, Henry Fonda, James Stewart and Joshua Logan.
        He is survived by a wife, Patricia; two sons, Derek, of Kirkland, Wash., and Rockwell, of Orcas Island; a daughter, Abigail Rueb, of Orcas, and four grandchildren.
