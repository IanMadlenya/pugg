        Dr. Karel Steinbach, a gynecologist and general practitioner in Queens, died on Monday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. He was 96 years old and lived in Jackson Heights, Queens.
        He died of a heart attack, his nephew, Frank Steiner, said.
        Dr. Steinbach, a native of Czechoslovakia, held undergraduate and medical degrees from Charles University in Prague. He practiced medicine there until he came to the United States in 1939. For many years he was a civilian doctor for the Army at Governors Island and Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn.
        Besides his nephew, who lives in Scotia, N.Y., Dr. Steinbach is survived by a niece, Margaret Donath of Montreal.
