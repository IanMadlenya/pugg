        Charles W. Pilling, music director of the Central City Chorus and organist of the Central Presbyterian Church, died on Aug. 12 at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center. He was 40 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was lymphoma, said his companion, Leonard DeCicco.
        Mr. Pilling assumed the leadership of the chorus, an amateur choral society, and also became minister of music at Central Presbyterian in 1983. Under his direction the chorus became known for presenting rarely performed works by both familiar and lesser-known composers.
        In 1992 Mr. Pilling and the Central City Chorus performed the New York premiere of Benjamin Britten's ''Company of Heaven,'' a 1937 cantata that had been lost for more than 50 years. In his last concert, on June 1, Mr. Pilling conducted the world premiere of David Clarke Isley's ''Come Holy Spirit.''
        Born in Storm Lake, Iowa, Mr. Pilling graduated from Drake University and earned master's degrees in both organ performance and theology from Yale University. He also worked as a publicist for Shaw Concerts, an artists' management agency, from 1983 to 1996, and in a similar position with Kaylor Artists Management from 1996.
        In addition to Mr. DeCicco, he is survived by his parents, Alan and Jane Pilling of Bella Vista, Ark., and a brother, Jack, of Storm Lake.
