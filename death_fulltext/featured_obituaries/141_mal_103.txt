        Lawrence Doyce Hancock, a philanthropist who parlayed his L. D. Hancock Company into Hancock Fabrics, one of the nation's largest retail fabric chains, died on Oct. 5 at the North Mississippi Medical Center after a brief illness. He was 85.
        Mr. Hancock's career began inauspiciously. Armed with just a high school education, he started out as a door-to-door salesman peddling sundries and candies. After serving three and a half years in the Navy in  World War II, Mr. Hancock returned to his native Tupelo, Miss., expanded his business to include fabrics, changed its name to the Hancock Textile Company and started opening stores. By the time he merged his company with Lucky Stores of California in 1971, Hancock Textile had 81 company stores and 265 franchise stores in 19 states. Fifteen years later, Lucky spun off the business, renamed Hancock Fabrics, as a public company. Today, the company operates 480 stores in 38 states, employs 6,700 people and has annual sales of close to $400 million.
        Mr. Hancock spent the last decade of his life as a cattle rancher, orange grower, real estate developer and philanthropist. He established the Hancock Foundation, which supports evangelistic work overseas, and a program in the United States to teach reading and math to students with learning difficulties. Tupelo High School and the Tupelo Salvation Army sit on land donated by Mr. Hancock.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Elaine Graham; four children, Doyce Deas, Lauren Patterson, Larry Hancock and Janice Allen, all of Tupelo; four sisters, Ruby Kennon of New Albany, Miss., Earline Edwards of Memphis, Theresa Kilgore of Tupelo and Odessa Clayton of Montgomery, Ala.; two brothers, Delma Hancock of Darden, Miss., and Herman Hancock of Asheville, N.C.; 11 grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
