        Peter F. Pasternack, a cardiologist at New York University Medical Center who made his mark in the study of risk assessment in surgery, died on Monday at his home on the East Side of Manhattan. He was 50.
        The cause was coronary artery disease, a spokesman for the center said.
        Dr. Pasternack was known nationally as an expert in assessing the risks posed by related heart disease to patients about to undergo surgery involving various other parts of the heart's vascular ''tree.'' That includes the aorta and the two great arteries of the neck -- the carotid arteries.
        He pioneered a procedure for the preliminary screening of such patients with noninvasive assessments of the performance of the heart's lower left chamber and stress-test exercises. He wrote many articles, book chapters and reviews in his field.
        At his death, Dr. Pasternack was a clinical associate professor of medicine, teaching medical students and residents. He also worked as an attending physician at Bellevue Hospital Center and N.Y.U. Medical Center.
        Born in Manhattan, he graduated in 1969 from N.Y.U. and received his medical degree from its School of Medicine in 1973.
