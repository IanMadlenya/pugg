        Clay P. Bedford, a top executive of Kaiser Industries in California for most of his 49 years at the company, died in his sleep Saturday at his home in Paradise Valley, Ariz. He was 88 years old.
        The cause of death was not specified, a family spokesman said.
        Mr. Bedford joined industrialist Henry J. Kaiser in 1925 and rose to executive vice president of Kaiser-Frazer Corporation. Among the major projects he worked on were the construction of the Bonneville and Grand Coulee dams, the building of the Great Central Highway in Cuba, the laying of an oil pipeline from the United States to Mexico, the manufacture of Willys and Kaiser vehicles and shipbuilding in World War II. In 1942 he supervised the assembly of a 10,500-ton cargo vessel in less than five days.
        From 1951 to 1953, Mr. Bedford served the Federal government as an adviser on increasing production. He then returned to Kaiser until his retirement in 1976, when he was president of Kaiser Aerospace and Electronics.
        Born in Benjamin, Tex., Mr. Bedford graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1924. Later he served as a trustee of his alma mater and of St. Mary's College in Moraga, Calif., Educational Facilities Laboratory in New York City, the American Graduate School of International Management in Glendale, Ariz., and the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland, Calif.
        He is survived by his wife, Catherine A.; three children, Peter B. of Lafayette, Calif., Ann C. Wallace of Scottsdale, Ariz., and Clay P. Jr. of Barrington, N.H.; 10 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.
