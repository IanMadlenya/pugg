        Mr. Kelly was a medic with the 48th Armored Infantry Battalion and was recognized for his bravery in rescuing wounded comrades in an attack on the German town of Alemert in April 1945. As the unit approached the town, machine-gun fire began, and the troops retreated. Many of the wounded could not get out, and Mr. Kelly, a corporal, made 10 trips through heavy gun fire to help 17 men across 300 yards of open terrain.
        Mr. Kelly was born in Brooklyn. He was a graduate of the Fordham Law School and was a veterans' representative to the Civil Service Commission, from which he retired in 1978.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Wilma Grassman, of Spring Lake Heights, N.J.; a son, Thomas Jr., of Manhattan; two daughters, Patricia, of North Oxford, Mass., and Kathy Benini of Wayne, N.J., and a brother, William, of Forest Hills, Queens.
