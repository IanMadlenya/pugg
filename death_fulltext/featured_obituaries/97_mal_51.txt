        Raphael Mitchel Robinson, a mathematician who contributed to some of the more esoteric fields in his discipline during a career of nearly six decades, died on Jan. 27 at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Francisco. He was 83 and lived in Berkeley, Calif.
        The cause was pneumonia after a stroke in December, according to the University of California at Berkeley, where he was professor emeritus of mathematics.
        Born in National City, Calif., Dr. Robinson received bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees at Berkeley. He briefly taught at Brown University before joining the faculty at Berkeley in 1937 as an instructor.
        He was promoted to full professor in 1949 and retired in 1973 to devote more time to research. He remained at work on campus until his stroke, a university spokesman said.
        Dr. Robinson explored such areas as logic, set theory, complex analysis and number theory. He was among the first to use computers to obtain results in pure mathematics. With knowledge of computers still in its infancy, in 1952 he wrote the first program to factor a large prime number.
        Dr. Robinson's wife of 44 years and longtime collaborator on mathematical papers, Dr. Julia Bowman Robinson, died in 1985.
