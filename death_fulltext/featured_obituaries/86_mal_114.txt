        Peter Lawrence, an arts administrator and theater producer, died on Monday in Washington. He was 74 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his son Michael, of Washington.
        Mr. Lawrence produced three Broadway musicals: the 1950 revival of "Peter Pan," starring Jean Arthur and Boris Karloff, with music by Leonard Bernstein; Benjamin Britten's "Let's Make an Opera" (1951), and "Shinbone Alley" (1957), starring Eartha Kitt and Eddie Bracken. In the early 1950's, he was also an associate director at CBS Television, where he worked with Joseph Papp.
        From 1967 to 1976, he was the first administrator of the Garden State Arts Center, the development director of the Saratoga Performing Arts Center, and the house manager of the Vivian Beaumont Theater when it was the site of the New York Shakespeare Festival.
        Mr. Lawrence was born in Manhattan. After attending Lawrence High School in Nassau County, he worked as a freelance photographer for a time. He changed his name from Joseph Uriel Hoexter when he became involved in the theater.
        During World War II, Mr. Lawrence, who had made a stab at a Broadway acting career, directed plays for the U.S.O. in Europe. From 1944 to 1947, he was the executive manager of Ballet Theater.
        Mr. Lawrence's first marriage ended in divorce.
        In addition to his son Michael, he is survived by his wife, Mary Carpenter Lawrence of Saratoga Springs, N.Y.; another son, Adam, of Tokyo; a daughter, Wendy, of Washington; a sister, Joan C. Hoexter of Manhattan, and two grandsons.
