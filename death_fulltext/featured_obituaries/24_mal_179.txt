        Mr. Andrews, a native of Wichita, Kan., was a pilot with the British Royal Air Force in the later years of World War II. He was a co-founder of Pacific Southwest Airlines in 1949 and was named president of the company in 1962.
        He helped institute an early form of frequent-flier programs, offering discounted fares or free trips to regular customers. In the early 1970's the airline was the victim of several hijackings and in one instance two hijackers and a passenger were killed in an exchange of gunfire with agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
        Mr. Andrews retired in 1976. The airline was absorbed by USAir in 1986.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary, of San Diego.
