        Arthur T. Mosher, a former president of the Agricultural Development Council, an international agricultural development organization, died Sunday at his home in Black Mountain, N.C. He was 82 years old.
        Dr. Mosher, who lived for many years in Ithaca, N.Y., before moving to North Carolina last year, suffered from Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease for several years, his son Richard said.
        For nearly two decades Dr. Mosher headed the agricultural council, a nonprofit organization founded in 1953 by John D. Rockefeller 3d. The council helps train people in economic development and agricultural extension services in countries around the world. He was the council's executive director from 1957 to 1967, and its president from 1967 to 1973.
        Dr. Mosher, a native of Ames, Iowa, received a bachelor's degree in agriculture from the University of Illinois in 1932, a master's degree in agricultural economics from that university in 1941 and a doctorate in economics from the University of Chicago in 1946.
        He spent part of the 1930's as a missionary for the Presbyterian Church in India and then returned to India in 1948, serving for five years as principal of the Allahabad Agricultural Institute.
        Dr. Mosher was a member of the President's Science Advisory Council's Panel on World Food Supply from 1966 to 1967, and was chairman of the Research Advisory Committee of the Agency for International Development from 1965 to 1971. He retired in 1973.
        Among his many awards was the Presidential World Without Hunger Award in 1984, and in 1976 he was named a Fellow of the American Agricultural Economics Association, that organization's highest honor.
        He is survived by his wife of 57 years, the former Alice Wynne Hall; a daughter, Anne Wimsatt, of Lewistown, Pa.; three sons, William, of Swannanoa, N.C., Ted, of Laurel, Md., and Richard, of Minneapolis, and five grandchildren.
