        Samuel Mordechai Kurtz, an architect of hospitals and commercial buildings, died on July 15 at St. Paul's Manor in San Diego. Mr. Kurtz, who was 89, had moved to San Diego from North Miami Beach in December.
        He died of congestive heart failure, his son Gerry said.
        Mr. Kurtz joined York & Sawyer, an architectural firm in Manhattan, in the early 1930's. In World War II he was the principal architect of the Army Tripler General Hospital in Hawaii and the St. Albans Naval Hospital in Queens.
        He also participated in the design of one of the firm's major works, the Bowery Savings Bank on East 42d Street opposite Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan. York & Sawyer later became Kiff, Colean, Voss & Souder, and Mr. Kurtz was general manager in the late 1950's. The firm is now defunct. Designed Saks Building Fifth Avenue
        Mr. Kurtz was briefly engaged in private practice in the mid-1950's and was responsible for the renovation of the Tuscany Hotel on East 39th Street between Lexington and Park Avenues in Manhattan, and the design of the Saks Fifth Avenue building in Manhattan.
        He retired in 1970 and moved to North Miami Beach, where he became an associate of Giller Associates, a Miami firm. He remained active in his work until about two years ago.
        Mr. Kurtz was born in Odessa, Ukraine, and immigrated with his parents to New York City in 1908. He graduated from the Cooper Union and did graduate work at Columbia University's School of Architecture.
        He was a past president of the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects. In 1964 he received the chapter's Harry B. Rutkins Memorial Award for outstanding service to the profession. He was also a fellow of the American Institute of Architects.
        Besides his son Gerry, of San Diego, he is survived by another son, Robert Kurtz of East Brunswick, N.J.; six grandchildren, and 14 great-grandchildren.
