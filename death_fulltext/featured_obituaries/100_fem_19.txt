        Joan Thayer Hupper, Miss Joan of "Romper Room" in New York City from 1957 to 1961, died last Friday at her home in Wilton, Conn. She was 61.
        The cause was cancer, her family said.
        For the New York production of "Romper Room," Mrs. Hupper kept a changing cast of six toddlers busy for an hour playing games and learning. The program was broadcast on weekdays.
        Mrs. Hupper was born in Rockville Centre, L.I., and graduated from Goucher College with a major in psychology.
        She is survived by her husband, Joel H. Hupper; a daughter, Anne Gans of Scarsdale, N.Y.; a son, David of Sudbury, Mass.; a sister, Marjorie Fernald of Brunswick, Me., and a grandson.
