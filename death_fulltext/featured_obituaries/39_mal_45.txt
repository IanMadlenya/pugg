        The Rev. Virgil C. Blum, a Jesuit priest and educator who was the founder and president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, died at his home yesterday after a short illness. He was 76 years old and lived in the Jesuit residence at Marquette University in Milwaukee.
        Father Blum established the Milwaukee-based league, which explores activity against Roman Catholicism in a variety of fields, in 1973. He was a strong proponent of using tax money for the support of private and parochial schools.
        He was born in Defiance, Iowa, and received degrees at St. Louis University, including a doctorate in political science. He taught at Creighton University and at Marquette until his retirement in 1978. Marquette has established an award in political science in his honor, and in 1983 Pope John Paul II invested him as a Knight of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem.
        He is survived by six brothers and three sisters.
