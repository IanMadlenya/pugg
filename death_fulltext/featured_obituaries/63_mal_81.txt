        Anthony G. DePalma, retired president of the world's leading banana company, died last Sunday at his home in Chester, N.H. He was 73 years old.
        He died of prostate cancer, his family said.
        Mr. DePalma had been president of the United Fruit Group, the largest grower, shipper and marketer of bananas, now called Chiquita Brands International Inc.
        His career at the company spanned nearly 40 years. He started in the purchasing department in the Manhattan office and at various times headed the marketing and transportation divisions. From 1965 to 1977 he worked at the company's Boston headquarters. He retired as president in 1986.
        Mr. DePalma, who was born in the Bronx, was a promising music student, winning a piano competition for a full scholarship to the Juilliard School. But he turned down the scholarship and chose instead to study marine engineering and architecture at the University of Michigan, where he graduated in 1939.
        He served four years in the Navy in World War II, reaching the rank of lieutenant commander and receiving a Silver Star. After the war he earned a master's degree in business administration at New York University.
        His first wife, the former Harriet Smith, died in 1972.
        Surviving are his wife of 16 years, the former Ellen Cohane; their daughter, Emily, and son, Antony, and a sister, Teresa Cescot, of Hawley, Pa.
