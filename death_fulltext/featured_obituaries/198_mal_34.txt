        Frederic Bradlee, a New York actor and writer, died on Saturday at his home on the Upper East Side. He was 84.
        A native New Yorker whose original name was Frederick Josiah Bradlee III, Mr. Bradlee attended Harvard and Columbia Universities, but dropped out when he was hired as an understudy on Broadway.
        After Army service in World War II, he started to appear in Broadway and Off Broadway productions, and acted in touring company productions of ''A Winter's Tale,'' ''The Man Who Came to Dinner'' and ''Arms and the Man,'' among others.
        He contributed articles and verse to magazines and wrote a novel, ''Esperie'' (Houghton, 1967). With Cleveland Amory, he edited an anthology, ''Vanity Fair: Selections From America's Most Memorable Magazine, a Cavalcade of the 1920's and 1930's'' (Viking, 1960).
        Mr. Bradlee's survivors include his brother, Benjamin C., of Washington, a vice president at large of The Washington Post.
