        Freda Flier Maddow, an early Martha Graham dancer, died on Dec. 11 in Los Angeles. She was 87, and lived in Los Angeles.
        Her death was announced by her daughter Ellen Maddow.
        Ms. Maddow, who performed as Freda Flier, trained and danced in Los Angeles with Benjamin Zemach and Carmelita Maracci before moving to New York in 1935. She joined the Graham company in 1937 and performed with it until 1941. She danced in the original productions of ballets including ''Celebration,'' ''Primitive Mysteries,'' ''Letter to the World'' and ''Every Soul Is a Circus.''
        She also performed with Eugene Loring's Dance Players and danced on Broadway in the original production of ''Finian's Rainbow.'' In 1944 she married a screenwriter, Ben Maddow, and returned to Los Angeles, where she performed in films.
        She appeared in two dance productions after her formal retirement in 1948: in 1988, in New York in Rocky Bornstein's ''Vision Obscured,'' and in 1999 in the Los Angeles production of ''From the Horse's Mouth,'' a series, created by Tina Croll and James Cunningham, evoking the history of American dance.
        In addition to Ellen Maddow, of New York, Ms. Maddow is survived by another daughter, Emily Dawson of Bolton, Mass., and six grandchildren.
