        John W. Oliver, a senior Federal district judge, died of an aneurysm on Wednesday. He was 75 years old.
        Judge Oliver was appointed a Federal judge in 1962 by President John F. Kennedy. In 1976 he presided over the case that struck down professional baseball's reserve clause, opening the free-agency market for baseball players. Judge Oliver upheld an arbitrator's ruling in cases originated by the pitchers Andy Messersmith and Dave McNally.
        He was a graduate of the University of Missouri Law School and was with a Kansas City law firm, active in Democratic politics, before he was named to the bench.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Gertrude Field; two sons; two daughters; five grandchildren, and a brother.
