        Sigurd S. Larmon, who as chairman of Young & Rubicam from 1944 to 1962 was a leading figure in advertising, died Thursday at the Courtland Gardens Health Center in Stamford, Conn. He was 95 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Young & Rubicam, now the largest independent advertising agency in the United States, was founded in 1923 in Philadelphia by Raymond Rubicam and John Orr Young, who moved it to New York in 1926.
        Mr. Larmon joined the agency in 1929, became its president in 1942 and chairman in 1944. He guided the agency from the era of print and radio advertising into the television age. He increased the number of employees at the agency to 2,736, from 652.
        Under his management, the agency's billings grew to $280 million in 1962, from $40 million in 1942, a stunning amount for its day, Young & Rubicam's chairman and chief executive, Alex Kroll, said yesterday.
        Mr. Larmon was widely praised within the agency for having established generous salaries, trust funds, scholarships and other employee benefits. He said when he retired in 1962: ''We never had people leave this agency and take business with them. We believe in sharing. We try to do thoughtful things like remembering birthdays and anniversaries.''
        Sigurd Stanton Larmon was born in Stanton, Iowa, and was reared in Omaha. He was a graduate of Dartmouth College and was a trustee there.
        He was a friend of President Dwight D. Eisenhower and was national vice chairman of Citizens for Eisenhower in the 1952 and 1956 Eisenhower Presidential campaigns.
        Mr. Larmon also had been chairman of the American Association of Advertising Agencies and in 1962 was awarded the Printers Ink Advertising Gold Medal.
        He was a former trustee of the New York University Medical Center and a member of the Advisory Council of the Graduate School of Business of Columbia University.
        He is survived by a daughter, Helen V. Benizger, of South Norwalk, Conn.; a son, Jay, of Osterville, Mass., and 5 grandchildren.
