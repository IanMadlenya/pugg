        Dr. DeWitt S. Goodman, a professor of medicine at Columbia University and president of the New York chapter of the American Heart Association, died on Monday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 61 years old and lived in Tenafly, N.J.
        Dr. Goodman died of a pulmonary embolism and had been recovering from abdominal surgery, said officials at the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University.
        He was considered a leading researcher in heart disease, and his specialties included cholesterol metabolism and its role in the development of heart and artery disease.
        Dr. Goodman, who held the Tilden-Weger-Bieler Professorship of Preventive Medicine at Columbia, was an attending physician at Columbia-Presbyterian and the director of the Specialized Center for Research in Arteriosclerosis and the Institute of Human Nutrition, both at Columbia University. He became president of the New York Chapter of the American Heart Association in July after serving as president-elect for two years.
        Dr. Goodman, a native of New York City, graduated from Harvard College in 1951 and from the Harvard Medical School in 1955. He was an intern and resident at Columbia-Presbyterian from 1955 to 1959 and then a postdoctoral researcher at Hammersmith Hospital in London before joining the faculty at Columbia in 1962.
        He won a number of awards and fellowships, including a Guggenheim Fellowship, and received an honorary doctorate from the University of Oslo in 1986.
        He is survived by his wife, Ann Bregstein; a son, Dr. Daniel Goodman of New York City, and a daughter, Dr. Elizabeth Goodman of San Francisco, both physicians.
