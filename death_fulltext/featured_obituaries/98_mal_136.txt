        Dmitri Kessel, a photographer whose camera captured graphic scenes of warfare as well as the wonders of nature and great art, died on Sunday in Southampton Hospital on Long Island. He was 92 and had lived in Paris for 30 years before moving to Wainscott, L.I.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, said Alison Hart, a spokeswoman for Life magazine.
        During a 60-year career, Mr. Kessel worked as an industrial photographer, a war correspondent and combat photographer, and a photo essayist for Life magazine. During World War II, he sailed on convoy escorts in the North Atlantic, covered the landing of American troops in the Aleutian Islands and the British landing in Greece. He also photographed the Greek civil war.
        In later years, Mr. Kessel traveled widely. He lived on the Yangtze River in China for seven months while producing a photo essay for Life. He photographed the Andes Mountains in South America and mining operations in Central Africa, and was widely praised for his exacting pictures of famous artworks. He also took many pictures of royalty.
        Mr. Kessel was born in 1902 in the Russian Ukraine and immigrated to the United States in the 1920's. He wrote of his life as a photographer in "On Assignment" (1985), and was also the author of "Splendors of Christendom" (1963).
        He is survived by his wife, Shirley, and a sister, Polya Morman of Hallandale, Fla.
