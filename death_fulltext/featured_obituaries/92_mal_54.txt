        Dr. Moses C. Shelesnyak, a physiologist who carried out research on human fertility and contraception, was found bludgeoned to death on Monday morning at his home here. He was 85.
        On Tuesday, investigators booked an acquaintance on suspicion of murdering Dr. Shelesnyak. The acquaintance, Paul Joseph Donovick, 31, was arrested as he strolled along a sidewalk in Buellton, three miles west of here.
        Lieut. Joseph A. Smith of the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department said Mr. Donovick had been visiting Dr. Shelesynak and killed him with a blunt instrument on Sunday evening.
        Dr. Shelesnyak held various positions at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovoth, Israel, from 1950 to 1968, serving as an instructor, senior scientist and head of the biodynamics department. A principal research interest was why the fertilized ovum nests in the uterus.
        From 1968 to 1977 he was director of the interdisciplinary communications program of the Smithsonian Institution.
        He moved to Solvang, 45 miles north of Santa Barbara, about 10 years ago from Maryland.
        He was born in 1909 in Chicago. He earned a bachelor's degree at the University of Wisconsin and a doctorate in anatomy at Columbia University in 1933. He was a researcher at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City from 1936 to 1940, when he moved to Beth Israel Hospital, also in New York.
        From 1946 to 1949, he was the head of the ecology branch of the Office of Naval Research. Later he became head of a research office of the Arctic Institute of North America at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
        His wife, Roslyn, died in 1987.
