        Stonewall B. Stickney, who supervised a court-ordered overhaul of Alabama's mental health system as its first full-time Commissioner, died on Wednesday. He  was 72.
        Mr. Stickney took over the system in 1968 when hundreds of mentally ill and mentally retarded people were warehoused in state institutions. After a Federal  judge ruled in 1971 that involuntarily committed patients had a right to adequate treatment, he put an overhaul into effect.
        Mr. Stickney was at odds with Gov. George C. Wallace over issues that included Mr. Stickney's efforts to integrate mental health centers. Governor Wallace fired him in 1973.
        Survivors include his wife, Carol, of Montrose, Ala., and three sons.
