        Charles M. Beeghly, a steel executive who began his career as a salesman and rose to be chairman and chief executive of the Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, died on Feb. 18 at his home in Delray Beach, Fla. He was 90 years old.
        The cause of death was a heart attack, said his brother, R. T. Beeghly.
        Mr. Beeghly was born in Bloomville, Ohio, and graduated from Ohio Wesleyan University in 1930. He joined the Cold Metal Products Company in 1934 and was named division president when the company was acquired by Jones & Laughlin five years later.
        In 1958, Mr. Beeghly became a corporate executive vice president. He served as chairman and chief executive of the company from 1963 until he retired in 1968. During his tenure as chairman, he oversaw the sale of a majority stake in Jones & Laughlin to Ling-Temco-Vought Inc.
        In 1965, Jones & Laughlin was one of eight steel concerns fined $50,000 each on charges of conspiring to fix prices in the carbon sheet steel industry. The company is now a division of the LTV Steel Corporation.
        Mr. Beeghly served in the Army Air Corps in World War II. He was a member of the Office of Price Stablization's general steel products industry advisory committee during the Korean War.
        He is survived by his brother; his wife, Janet, of Delray Beach; a daughter, Judith Wallace of Akron, Ohio; a son, Charles Beeghly Jr. of Orlando, Fla.; 12 grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren.
