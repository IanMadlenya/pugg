        Joseph Holland, whose long stage career included a number of Shakespearean roles, died on Dec. 28 at his home in Santa Fe, N.M. He was 84.
        The cause was heart failure, said his companion, Vincent Newton.
        Mr. Holland was born in Virginia and graduated from the University of Richmond and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. He made his debut with Katharine Cornell in "Romeo and Juliet" in 1934 and appeared in several other Cornell productions, among them "Saint Joan" and "Antony and Cleopatra."
        With Orson Welles and John Houseman, Mr. Holland was a founding member of the Mercury Theater. In 1937 he played the title role in the troupe's first production, "Julius Caesar," in a cast that included Welles, Martin Gabel and Joseph Cotten. He also appeared in the Basil Rathbone productions of "Julius Caesar," "Coriolanus" and "Hamlet," and he had roles in the Broadway productions of "The Show-Off" (1950) and "The Bad Seed" (1954).
        He is survived by his companion.
