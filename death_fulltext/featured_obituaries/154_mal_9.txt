        Hilary Tjader Harris, an experimental and documentary filmmaker and kinetic sculptor, died on Oct. 26  at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 69.
        The cause was kidney failure, said David Hollister, a friend and collaborator, adding that Mr. Harris had contracted an undiagnosed illness three years ago in Central America.
        A filmmaker influenced by the work of Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, Mr. Harris explored the possibilities of abstract motion in two early short films, ''Longhorns'' (1951) and  ''Generation'' (1956). His third film, ''Highway,'' used a rock 'n' roll score to accompany fast-moving images filmed from a speeding car on highways and bridges around New York  City. The work received a bronze medal at the Brussels International Experimental Film Festival in 1958 and led to an offer from the Scottish Film Board to direct a documentary  on shipbuilding on the Clyde River in Glasgow. That film, ''Seawards the Great Ships,'' won an Academy Award for best short subject in 1962.
        In the 60's and 70's Mr. Harris had  a studio in Greenwich Village, where he made experimental, documentary, industrial and animated films. One, ''Nine Variations on a Dance Theme'' (1966), a study of the dancer  Bettie de Jong, received prizes at several film festivals.
        Mr. Harris was a pioneer in the development of time-lapse photography, which was the basic technique of his 1975 film, ''Organism.'' It compared the patterns of activity in New York City to the rhythms of nature.
        In the 1980's he moved to Woodstock, N.Y., where he designed and built his own house, shaped like a spaceship, and worked at designing a computer-oriented ''drawing machine.'' He was still working on this invention when he became ill.
        He is survived by his third wife, Dena Crane, and by two daughters, Branwyn and Rhana, and a son, Morgan, from his previous marriage to Maxine Barnes Rochlin.
