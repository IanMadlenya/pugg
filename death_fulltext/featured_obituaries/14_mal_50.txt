        Mr. Redden was taken to the hospital by ambulance after a friend found he was not breathing this morning. Deputy Coroner Chuck Smith said that although an autopsy did not reveal evidence of foul play, the preliminary findings were inconclusive. He said the cause of death would not be established until results of toxicology and tissue studies were known.
