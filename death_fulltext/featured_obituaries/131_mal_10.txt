        James Sardos, a manager of opera singers, died on Nov. 17 at his home in Manhattan. He was 65.
        The cause was a heart attack from complications of diabetes, said his wife, Rita De Carlo Sardos, a mezzo-soprano.
        In a career spanning almost five decades, Mr. Sardos managed such well-known singers as Jerome Hines, whose career he helped build; Paul Plishka, Carol Neblett, Mignon Dunn and Misha Raitzin.
        Mr. Sardos, a lifelong resident of New York City, attended Columbia University as a chemistry major. While still a student, he met Mr. Hines, who encouraged him to him make a career in publicity. Before establishing his own firm, Sardos Artist Management, in 1955, he was the publicity agent for Birgit Nilsson, James McCracken and Sandra Warfield.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by his father, George, and a brother, Christopher, both of Larchmont, N.Y.
