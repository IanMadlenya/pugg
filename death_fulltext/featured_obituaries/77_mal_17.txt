        John J. Morrissey, a retired Detroit advertising and marketing executive, died Monday at his winter home in Maui, Hawaii. He was 66 and lived in Bloomfield Village, Mich.
        The cause of death was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Morrissey, a graduate of the University of Michigan, served as a lieutenant in the Marine Corps before starting his career with the J. Walter Thompson Company in Chicago in 1950. He was elected a vice president in 1959 and moved to the Detroit office three years later to take charge of the Ford Motor Company account.
        In 1966 Mr. Morrissey joined Ford as director of advertising and sales promotion on the company's marketing staff. He was appointed general marketing manager in 1974.
        In 1979 he left Ford to become executive vice president and general manager of the Detroit office of Kenyon & Eckhardt Inc., which handled the Lincoln-Mercury account at the time. The next year the agency switched clients, taking over Chrysler's advertising as the auto maker was making a comeback. He was elected chairman of Kenyon & Eckhardt and retired in 1983.
        Mr. Morrissey is survived by his wife of 43 years, S. Jean, six daughters, two sons, two sisters, a brother and 11 grandchildren.
