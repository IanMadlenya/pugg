        Herbert Katzman, an Expressionist painter known for his densely textured figurative canvases, died on Oct. 15 at his home in Manhattan. He was 81.
        The cause was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, his former wife Laurel Carroll said.
        In the 1950's Mr. Katzman was featured in group shows at the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Museum of Modern Art and the Venice Biennale. His work is in the permanent collections of the Whitney, the Modern, the Art Institute of Chicago and elsewhere. He received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1968 and a Lee Krasner Award from the Pollock-Krasner Foundation in 2000.
        Mr. Katzman was a slatherer, using a palette knife to lay down paint so thick ''its troughs and crests seem almost like a frozen sea,'' The New York Times said in 1951. Writing in The Times in 1964, Stuart Preston described Mr. Katzman's figure and landscape paintings as ''deviously expressionist in character, by an artist whose style might be described as restrained Soutine.''
        Herbert Henry Katzman was born on Jan. 8, 1923, in Chicago. He studied at the Art Institute of Chicago and, after a stint in Paris, settled in New York. When the dealer Terry Dintenfass opened her Manhattan gallery in 1959, Mr. Katzman was one of the five artists represented, along with Robert Gwathmey, Philip Evergood, Antonio Frasconi and Sidney Goodman. (Ms. Dintenfass died on Tuesday.)
        The city itself, particularly its waterways, was one of Mr. Katzman's favorite subjects. He died with a drawing of New York Harbor on the table in front of him, Ms. Carroll said.
        Mr. Katzman's first marriage, to the former Judith Baker, ended in divorce, as did his later marriage to Ms. Carroll. He is survived by three children from his first marriage: Nicholas, of Manhattan and Berlin; Steven, of San Rafael, Calif.; and Annie, of Manhattan; and by two grandchildren.
