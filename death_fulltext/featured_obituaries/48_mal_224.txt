        Dr. Herbert Gaines Langford, a professor of medicine at the University of Mississippi who was an authority on high blood pressure, died Saturday at the university medical center, where he was hospitalized after suffering an aneurysm last Monday. He was 68 years old.
        Dr. Langford was among the first to suggest that differences in potassium consumption account for variations in the incidence of high blood pressure among ethnic groups.
        Survivors include his wife, Patsy; three sons and a daughter.
