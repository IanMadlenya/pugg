        Vera Nabokov, the widow of Vladimir Nabokov and the manager of his publishing affairs, died Sunday in Vevey, Switzerland. She was 89 years old.
        She died after a brief illness, her son, Dmitri, said.
        Nabokov dedicated all of his works to her. In Brian Boyd's biography, "Vladimir Nabokov: The Russian Years" (Princeton University Press, 1990), Mrs. Nabokov was described as the author's "wife, muse and ideal reader; his secretary, typist, editor, proofreader, translator and bibliographer; his agent, business manager, legal counsel and chauffeur; his research assistant, teaching assistant and professorial understudy." She said, however, she was not a model for any of the characters in her husband's books. Mr. Boyd quoted her as saying Nabokov always "had the good taste to keep me out of his books."
        She had a prodigious memory and could recite long passages from Pushkin, Mr. Boyd wrote, adding that Nabokov considered her to have the best sense of humor he had ever known. Her sense of privacy, he said, was even stronger than her husband's.
        Born in St. Petersburg, Mrs. Nabokov, whose maiden name was Slonim and whose father was a prominent lawyer, left Russia during the revolution. She married Nabokov in Berlin in 1925, and they fled Nazi Germany with their son in 1937. They left Paris for the United States in 1940.
        The family settled in Montreux, Switzerland, in 1961. Nabokov died in 1977.
        Besides her son, Mrs. Nabokov is survived by a sister, Sonia Slonim.
        After private services in Vevey today, she is to be buried with her husband in Clarens, Switzerland.
