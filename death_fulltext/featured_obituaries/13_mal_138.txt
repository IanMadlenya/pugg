        The Rev. David Otis Fuller, a fundamentalist preacher who helped establish a children's radio ministry and the Grand Rapids Baptist College and Seminary, has died at the age of 84.
        Mr. Fuller died Sunday at Blodgett Memorial Medical Center, hours after complaining of faintess at a prayer meeting at the Wealthy Park Baptist Church, where he was pastor until his retirement in 1974.
        Born in Brooklyn, Mr. Fuller founded the Children's Bible Hour, a Grand Rapids-based Christian radio program now broadcast by 660 radio stations worldwide.
        ''He was one of the leading fundamentalist preachers in the country,'' said the Rev. Robert Gage, minister of the Wealthy Park Baptist Church. ''It is going to leave a big void for us.''
        Funeral services are scheduled for Wednesday at Wealthy Park.
        Survivors include his wife, Virginia; a daughter, Beverly Berman of West Hartford, Conn.; two sons, Alan of Golden, Colo., and David of Tuckahoe, N.Y.; a sister, Muriel Fuller of New York City; 10 grandchildren and one great-grandson.
