        Edwin Leonard Knetzger Jr., the former head of the large multinational insurance brokerage firm Johnson & Higgins, died on Saturday in Bryn Mawr, Pa. He was 78.
        The cause was pulmonary fibrosis, his family said.
        Mr. Knetzger spent most of his career with Johnson & Higgins, then based in New York. He joined the company in 1959, headed its Pennsylvania branch in the 1970's and retired in 1985 as president of the parent company.
        In 1997, Johnson & Higgins merged into the Marsh & McLennan Companies to form the world's largest insurance broker.
        Mr. Knetzger, a native of St. Louis, graduated summa cum laude in 1948 with the war-delayed Princeton class of 1946.
        He worked for Prudential Life Insurance, with time out for active duty in the Korean War, until he joined Johnson & Higgins.
        Mr. Knetzger is survived by his wife, Leo Johnson Knetzger; two daughters, Louise K. Gallagher, and Virginia K. Unger; two sons, Edward L. III, and Hugh C.; and 13 grandchildren.
