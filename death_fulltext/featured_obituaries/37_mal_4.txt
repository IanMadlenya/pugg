        Dr. Lanier, a professor at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse, was one of a group of scientists who devised ways to trap the beetles and eradicate them. His advice was widely sought by countries in northern Europe and other parts of the world where Dutch elm disease has been a severe problem.
        Dr. Lanier was born in Alamosa, Colo. He received a bachelor's, a master's and a doctorate from the University of California at Berkeley. He worked for the Canadian Forestry Service in Calgary, Alberta, before joining SUNY in 1970.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Carol Combes; his parents, Olive and Robert Lanier of Pittsburg, Calif.; a daughter, Lorene, of Cambridge, Mass.; a son, Jason, of Alfred, N.Y.; a sister, Joanne Facaros of Alma, Mich., and two brothers, Loren, of Los Gatos, Calif., and Dennis, of Escondido, Calif.
