        Dr. Albert Saul Gordon, a physiologist whose work at New York University advanced the fight against blood disease, died yesterday at Long Beach Memorial Hospital on Long Island. He was 81 years old.
        He died of heart failure while visiting family members on the way to his summer home in Copake, a resort town in Columbia County, N.Y., his family said.
        Dr. Gordon had been associated with New York University ever since he studied there for his master's degree and doctorate in physiology.
        He began as an assistant instructor in 1931, became an associate professor in 1936 and was made a full professor of biology in 1954. He reached emeritus status in 1975 but took the title of research professor in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences to continue to work with graduate students and doctoral candidates. Blood Cell Control Factor
        Dr. Philip Furmanski, chairman of the university's biology department, said Dr. Gordon's "area of interest was to determine what controls the formation and function of blood cells."
        "One of the most important things he did was to demonstrate that red bloodcell production is controlled by a factor that responds to the physiologic needs of the organism," Dr. Furmanski continued. "This factor was subsequently purified and genetically cloned. His research made that possible."
        Dr. Furmanski said Dr. Gordon's identification of the control factor became the basis for one of the main drugs now used in the biotechnology industry.
        Dr. Gordon, who also had a home in Deerfield Beach, Fla., is survived by his wife, the former Ruth Beitler; a daughter, Enid Bruck of North Woodmere, L.I., and two grandchildren.
