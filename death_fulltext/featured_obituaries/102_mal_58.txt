        Sidney Sulkin, a writer and former editor at the Kiplinger publishing organization, died on June 29 at his home in Bethesda, Md. He was 77 and also had a home in Harwich, Mass.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.

He became managing editor in 1971 and was editor from 1975 to 1981. He wrote "Complete Planning for College: The Kiplinger Guide to Your Education Beyond High School" (Harper; rev. ed., 1968).
        His poems and short stories appeared in many periodicals and anthologies. One collection, "The Secret Seed: Stories and Poems" (Dryad, 1983) remains in print.
        Mr. Sulkin is survived by his wife, Naomi Levenson Sulkin; a son, Jonathan L., of Syracuse, and a brother, Norman of Memphis.
