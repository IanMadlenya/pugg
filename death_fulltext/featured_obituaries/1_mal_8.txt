        Yves Allegret, a prominent French film maker, died Saturday, his family announced in Paris. He was 79 years old.
        Perhaps Mr. Allegret's most notable film was ''The Proud and the Beautiful'' (1953), based on a story by Jean-Paul Sartre. The film starred Michele Morgan as a recently widowed Frenchwoman who rehabilitates a drunken French doctor portrayed by Gerard Philipe.
        Other Allegret features include ''The Cheat'' (1950), ''Young Girls Beware'' (1957), ''Port of Desire'' (1958) and ''Oasis'' (1960). For television Mr. Allegret made a series based on Georges Simenon's famous fictional Parisian detective, Inspector Maigret.
        By assisting three directors - his brother, Marc, Augusto Genina and Jean Renoir - Mr. Allegret learned to direct. His documentary short, ''The Girls of France,'' was shown at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Mr. Allegret's first feature film was made in 1941. During World War II he made light comedies.
        After the war, Mr. Allegret created films of social criticism in the film-noir genre. Several films, such as ''Dedee d'Anvers'' which was screened here in 1949, featured Simone Signoret, whom the director married in the mid-1940's. They had a daughter, Catherine, and were later divorced. Miss Signoret died in September 1985.
