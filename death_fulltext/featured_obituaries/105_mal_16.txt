        Kiiti Morita, a mathematician who made fundamental contributions in algebra and geometry, died of heart failure at the Sakakibara Heart Institute in Tokyo on Aug. 4. He was 80 years old.
        His death was disclosed recently in the United States by a mathematician familiar with his work.
        Dr. Morita was professor emeritus of Tsukuba University and former professor of Sophia University in Tokyo.
        He was known for the theorems he devised in 1958, together called Morita theory, in a branch of algebra called ring and module theory. The work helped to simplify many mathematical problems and is considered a set of basic concepts in algebra. In topology, a branch of geometry concerned with the general properties of shapes and spaces, he published "Normal Families and Dimension Theory for Metric Spaces" in 1954.
        He was born on Feb. 11, 1914, in Hamamatsu, Japan, and graduated from Tokyo Higher Normal School, now Tsukuba University, in 1936. He studied and taught at the university until 1978. He then taught at Sophia University.
        He is survived by his wife, Tomiko, a son, Yasuhiro, and a grandson.
