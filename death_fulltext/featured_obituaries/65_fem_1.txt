        Marjorie Severyns Ravenholt, an expert on Asia for government, news and non-profit organizations, died on Monday at the Swedish Hospital in Seattle. She was 71 years old.
        She died of complications after surgery for lung cancer, said her husband, Albert. The couple lived in Seattle and in Manila.
        Mrs. Ravenholt's Asian ties began when she was an exchange student in Japan, Korea and Manchuria. In World War II, she served in India and China as an intelligence agent for the United States Office of Strategic Services, then became a correspondent in China for Life magazine.
        She served as an analyst for a United States economic mission to China and later was director of education and information for the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction, which modernized much of Taiwan.
        She was born in Sunnyside, Wash., graduated from the University of Washington and studied at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy of Tufts University. She worked briefly for the United States Board of Economic Warfare at the beginning of World War II.
        She and her husband were among seven veteran journalists who returned to China in 1985 at the invitation of the Government.
        Mr. Ravenholt is the only immediate survivor.
