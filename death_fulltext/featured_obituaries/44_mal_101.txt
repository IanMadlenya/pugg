        Howell Arthur Inghram, professor emeritus of accounting at Columbia University, died on Thursday at Walton County Hospital in Monroe, Ga. He was 94 years old and lived in Monroe.
        He died of complications that followed an automobile accident in late July, a spokesman for the family said.
        Professor Inghram joined the Columbia faculty in 1925 as an instructor in accounting. He became a professor in 1937. He was director of the university's Institute of Accounting Instruction at the American Institute of Banking from 1930 to 1954. He retired in 1966.
        He was the author of several books on accounting and income taxation, including ''Principles of Accounting,'' with James L. Dohr (1946), and ''Cost Accounting'' (1935), which were used as texts at the Columbia School of Business.
        He was born in Atlanta and graduated from the University of Georgia in 1917. He received a master's degree in business in 1922 and a bachelor of laws degree in 1925 from Columbia.
        A widower, he is survived by three sisters, Catherine Glass, Margaret Moody and Louise Lovern, all of Newnan, Ga.; a daughter, Mary Elizabeth Thurston of Manhattan; four grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
