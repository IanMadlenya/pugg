        William Whitney Jackson, a lawyer and a former trustee for St. John's Riverside Hospital in Yonkers, died there on Tuesday. He was 82 and lived in Bronxville, N.Y.
        The cause was prostate cancer, said Lee Jackson, his wife of 43 years.
        Mr. Jackson graduated from Trinity College in Connecticut in 1934 and from Columbia University School of Law in 1937 before beginning a 56-year law career. Until he retired in December, Mr. Jackson worked at his own law firm.
        Besides specializing in banking and estate law, he was also knowledgeable in health law, said Ellwood Chase, chairman of the board of St. John's Riverside.
        For 15 years, beginning in 1977, Mr. Jackson served on the hospital board as an assistant secretary and as chairman of the law committee.
        In World War II, he was a special agent for the Army Counter-Intelligence Corps.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Leslie Jackson Clemons, and a granddaughter, Whitney Styles Clemons, both of Amelia Island, Fla.
