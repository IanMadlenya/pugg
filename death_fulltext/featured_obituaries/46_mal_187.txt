        Bill Vukovich 3d, a third-generation race car driver whose grandfather was killed while leading the Indianapolis 500 in 1955, died Sunday after a crash at Mesa Marin Speedway. He was 27 years old.
        Mr. Vukovich had just completed a few practice laps in preparation for a race when his car slammed into a wall. He was taken to Kern Medical Center, where he died a short time later.
        His grandfather, Bill Vukovich, won the Indianapolis 500 in 1953 and 1954 and was killed while leading the 1955 race. His father, Bill Vukovich Jr., was runner-up at Indianapolis in 1973 and raced Indianapolis-type cars for 12 years. The younger Vukovich, who lived in Fresno, Calif., raced in seven Indianapolis-type car events beginning in 1988 and earned $469,569 in his brief career. He competed in the last three Indianapolis 500 races, finishing 14th in 1988 when he was honored as rookie of the year.
        In 1990, he raced Indianapolis cars only twice, finishing 24th at Indianapolis and 13th in a 500-mile event at Michigan International Speedway. His best career finish in an Indianapolis-type car was ninth in the 1988 Pocono 500.
