        Cristobal Martinez-Bordiu, a surgeon who married Gen. Francisco Franco's only child in 1950 and later led the medical team attending the dictator until his death in 1975, died on Wednesday in the Ruber Internacional hospital in Madrid. He was 75.
        The cause of death was a cerebral hemorrhage, the hospital said.
        Born on July 26, 1922, into an aristocratic family in Mancha Real, Dr. Martinez-Bordiu earned his medical degree in 1944. He specialized in thoracic surgery and held important medical posts at Madrid hospitals in the 1970's. After studying the heart transplant work of Dr. Christian Barnard of South Africa, in 1968 he performed the first heart transplant in Spain; later that year, he and a Russian surgeon performed the first lung transplant in Spain.
        ''My vocation is not political,'' Dr. Martinez-Bordiu often said. ''I am a surgeon.'' But others described him as a Franco loyalist who tried to position himself for power during the general's final years and who sought to delay the transition to democracy after Franco's death.
        Dr. Martinez-Bordiu was defeated twice for elected posts, first in a campaign for Parliament in 1971, then in May 1976 when, with far-right support, he sought a seat on the National Council of the Movement, a key governing body. But he was soundly defeated by Adolfo Suarez, who later became Prime Minister and led Spain toward democracy.
        In the mid-1980's, a hospital in Madrid suspended Dr. Martinez-Bordiu, questioning his competence, and a medical school dismissed him as director. But he contended that with a Socialist Government in power, the real cause for each action was political.
        He is survived by his wife, Carmen Franco Polo, and their seven children.
