        Irving Lash, who taught several generations of musicians during his more than 30 years as a teacher at the High School of Performing Arts, died on Monday at the North Shore Medical Center in Miami. He was 82 years old and lived in Miami.
        He died of complications of Alzheimer's disease, said his wife, Marjorie.
        Mr. Lash received his undergraduate and graduate education at Columbia University and taught at the High School of Performing Arts before entering the Navy in World War II. After his discharge, he returned to Performing Arts, now known as Fiorello H. La Guardia High School, where he taught instruments, history of music and theory and where he conducted the school orchestra until his retirement in 1972.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Warren, of Coventry, Conn.; a brother, Seymour, of Hilton Head, S.C.; and a sister, Lillian Goldsmith of Manhattan.
