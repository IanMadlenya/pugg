        Robert Lubar, a former managing editor of Fortune and foreign correspondent for Time, died on April 1 at the Breckenridge Center in Willoughby, Ohio. He was 74. A longtime resident of Port Washington, L..I., he moved to Whitingham, Vt., when he retired in 1985.
        He had suffered from Parkinson's disease for several years, said a son, Nicholas.
        In a career of nearly 40 years with Time Inc., he began as a writer for Time in Manhattan in 1946 and then moved overseas to a series of posts, including London, New Delhi, Bonn and Mexico City.
        He moved to Fortune in 1958 as an associate editor. He was an assistant managing editor from 1964 to 1970 before becoming managing editor. For the next 10 years, he oversaw the transition to a smaller magazine format and the move from monthly to biweekly publication. He returned to writing as a member of the board of editors before retiring.
        He was born in Manhattan and went to Columbia University, where he received an undergraduate degree and in 1941 a master's in journalism.
        Besides his son Nicholas, of Chagrin Falls, Ohio, he is survived by his wife of 47 years, Patricia Raney Lubar; three other sons, John, of Ottawa; Stephen, of Naples, Fla., and Andrew, of St. Paul, Minn.; a sister, Rachelle Marshall of Stanford, Calif., and five grandchildren.
