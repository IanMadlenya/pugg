        David V. Huntley, a vice president of the music publishing firm Boosey & Hawkes, died yesterday at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 47 and lived in Manhattan.
        He died after a long illness, a spokesman for the company said.
        Mr. Huntley joined Boosey & Hawkes in 1976, becoming promotion manager in 1980 and a vice president in 1986. He was influential in signing many well-known composers, including Steve Reich, Christopher Rouse and John Adams, who dedicated his Violin Concerto to him.
        Since 1980, Mr. Huntley had been a member of the Performance Committee of the Music Publishers Association of the United States, and was chairman of the committee for several years. He was also an artistic adviser to the New York City Ballet's 1988 American Music Festival.
        He is survived by his parents, Frances and Roy Huntley, of Phoenix, N.Y., and a sister, Helen, of Oswego, N.Y.
