        Philip J. Ryan, a lawyer, executive and former aide to Senator Robert F. Kennedy, died yesterday at a hospital in his hometown of Greenwich, Conn., at the age of 60.
        The cause of death was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Ryan recently stepped down as a director and the executive vice president of Envirofil, a waste-management company based in Philadelphia. From 1981 to 1991 he was of counsel to the Burns & Burns law firm in Manhattan. Earlier he was a partner in the Knapp, Bersen & Ryan firm.
        In the 1960's he held two government posts, first as an assistant United States attorney under Robert M. Morgenthau, then as an executive assistant to Senator Kennedy.
        Mr. Ryan was born in Brooklyn. He was a graduate of Fairfield University and of Fordham Law School. He served in the Navy from 1954 to 1956 and reached the rank of lieutenant commander.
        Surviving are his wife of 26 years, the former Jane Wray; a daughter, Victoria, of Greenwich; two sons, Philip J., of Whidbey Island, Wash., and Andrew L., of Greenwich, and three sisters, Mary R. Carter of Tinton Falls, N.J., Jane R. Devine of Huntington, L.I., and Louise R. Neil of Summit, N.J.
