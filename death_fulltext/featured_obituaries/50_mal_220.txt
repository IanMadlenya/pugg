        Milton Cohen, executive director of the Federation of the Handicapped, died on Sunday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 78 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of heart failure, a spokesman for the family said.
        As executive director of the federation since 1949, Mr. Cohen developed employment programs for homebound disabled people that served as a model and helped shape Federal legislation for the handicapped.
        He was the founder and first president of several organizations, including the International Association of Rehabilitation Facilities, now the National Association of Homebound and Institutionalized Persons; the National Council of Work Centers for the Severely Handicapped, and the Metropolitan New York Rehabilitation Association. He was chairman of an advisory committee to the New York State Office of Vocational Rehabilitation.
        In 1958 Mr. Cohen received a citation for meritorius service from the President's Committee on Employment of the Handicapped, to which he had been appointed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Lillian Schwartz; a son, Kenneth, of Jackson, Wyo.; a daughter, Phyllis Sorin of Livingston, N.J.; two stepsons, Richard Schwartz of Queens and Peter Schwartz of Manhattan; a stepdaughter, Sue Ann McCord of Sherman Oaks,, Calif.; seven grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
