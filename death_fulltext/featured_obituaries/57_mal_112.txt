        Gerard A. Perez, a retired makeup editor at The New York Times, died on Friday at Victory Memorial Hospital in Brooklyn. He was 71 years old and lived in Brooklyn.
        Mr. Perez died of cancer, his family said.
        Born in Glen Cove, L.I., he served as an Army medic in World War II and worked for his father's laundry business for two years after the war. He graduated from New York University in 1952.
        Mr. Perez was a reporter and copy editor in Ridgewood, N.J., for The Herald News before joining The Times in 1953 as a copy person. Later he was a clerk on the makeup desk and an assistant to the makeup editor. He was the deputy makeup editor from the mid-1960's until 1980. He retired last year.
        He is survived by his wife, Theresa, and a daughter, Barbara, both of Brooklyn.
