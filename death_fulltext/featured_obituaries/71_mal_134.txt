        Glenn Rowen, a member of the New York City Opera chorus for 17 years, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 59 years old.
        He died of AIDS, said Susan Woelzl, the opera's director of publicity.
        Mr. Rowen was born in Roswell, N.M., and was a graduate of Indiana University. He served in the United States Army in Germany from 1956 to 1962. Following his tour of duty, he sang with the Munich Opera and the Munich Chamber Choir.
        In addition to the New York City Opera, he sang with the American Chamber Opera, the Robert Shaw Chorale, the Harry Belafonte Singers and the De Paur Chorus.
        There are no immediate survivors.
