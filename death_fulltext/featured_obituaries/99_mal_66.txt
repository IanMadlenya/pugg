        Sidney Jacobs of Forest Hills, Queens, one of four brothers who became thoroughbred horse trainers, died last Sunday at Parkway Hospital in Forest Hills. He was 87 years old.
        The cause of death was complications from heart and liver disease, said his nephew, Robert Jacobs.
        Sidney Jacobs was a younger brother of Hirsch Jacobs, a Hall of Fame trainer. After World War II, in which Sidney was wounded during the Battle of the Bulge, he responded to Hirsch's urging and joined what was almost a family business.
        His most famous horse was Tudor Era. In the 1958 running in Laurel, Md., of the Washington D.C. International, one of America's celebrated races, Tudor Era finished first, only to be disqualified and dropped to second place behind an Australian horse, Sailor's Guide. Although the trainer and jockey of Sailor's Guide did not claim a foul, the stewards ruled that Tudor Era had lugged in and bumped the other horse.
        Mr. Jacobs is survived by his wife, the former Edith Mulligan; a son, Robert; a brother, Eugene, and 17 nephews and nieces.
