        Robert E. Hupka, who won renown with his photographs of Toscanini, died on Tuesday in New York. He was 81.
        Mr. Hupka, who was born in Vienna and emigrated to the United States, was in charge of the record library at RCA Victor in the 1940's when he secretly photographed Toscanini rehearsing the NBC Symphony Orchestra. The photographs were published in Samuel Antek's book, ''This Was Toscanini'' (1963, Vanguard Press), and later appeared on many record album jackets.
        In 1964-65, Mr. Hupka obtained permission from the Vatican to photograph Michelangelo's ''Piet√†,'' which was on view in the Vatican Pavilion at the New York World's Fair. Those photographs were published by Crown and have been shown in touring exhibitions.
        Mr. Hupka also worked for 40 years as a cameraman and then as an audio technician for CBS Television. An enthusiast of choral music, he recorded Gregorian chants and choral recitals and presented a series of weekly recorded concerts at Manhattanville College in Purchase, N.Y.
        He is survived by a sister, Marie Parkinson of Devon, England.
