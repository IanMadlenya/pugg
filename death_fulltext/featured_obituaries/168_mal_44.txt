        Edwin D. Etherington, who left the the top post at the American Stock Exchange to become president of Wesleyan University, died Jan. 8 at his home in Jupiter Island, Fla. He was 76.
        Mr. Etherington, a writer and lawyer by education, was a staunch civil rights advocate by avocation. He served in the Army during World War II. He earned a bachelor's degree in creative writing from Wesleyan, in Middletown, Conn., in 1948 and graduated from Yale Law School in 1952.
        He worked for a time as a lawyer in New York City, specializing in the brokerage business and investment banking. He soon went to the client side, and rose to become vice president of the the New York Stock Exchange in his five years there.
        In 1962, Mr. Etherington became president of the American Stock Exchange, which had been rocked by charges of mismanagement. He was credited with scraping the tarnish from its image and expanding career opportunities for women and minorities.
        Throughout his career on Wall Street, Mr. Etherington remained an active alumnus of Wesleyan. In 1967, he became the college's 12th president. It was a time of nationwide student unrest over racial and gender discrimination and the Vietnam War. Although there was little Mr. Etherington could do about the war beyond keeping campus tensions in check, he worked successfully to increase the number of minority students at Wesleyan and to get the all-male institution to admit women.
        During his three-year tenure, he spearheaded the creation of an on-campus African American Institute, now the Center for African American Studies; an 11-building Center for the Arts; and a scholarship program for students from Connecticut community colleges.
        Mr. Etherington maintained homes in both Old Lyme, Conn., and Jupiter Island. He is survived by his wife of 47 years, Katherine Colean Etherington; two sons, Edwin Jr. and Robert Miles; a granddaughter; and a brother.
