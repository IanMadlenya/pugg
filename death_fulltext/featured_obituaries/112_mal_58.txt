        Michael Herman, a teacher and an authority on folk dance, died on Friday in North Shore Hospital in Glen Cove, L.I. He was 85 and lived in Babylon, L.I.
        Mr. Herman, who was born in Cleveland to Ukrainian parents, filled his life with folk dancing from early on. The title of his popular 1947 book on the subject, "Folk Dances for All," was his credo.
        He came to New York in 1933 to study violin, supporting himself by teaching  folk dancing. He and his wife, Mary Jane Herman, who died in 1992, met in a Ukrainian folk dance group in New York. Together they were instrumental in helping to make folk dance popular in America, encouraging others to believe with them that there should be no national factions in folk dancing.
        They were expert in many national forms, once drawing tears from Pablo Casals when they performed the stately Catalan Sardana for him.
        Teaching at International House, Mr. Herman recognized the dearth of folk music records and founded the Folk Dancer Record Company. He also organized the  Michael Herman Folk Dance Orchestra, which made 15 records for RCA Victor.
        The Hermans taught at the 1939-40 World's Fair in New York, and in 1951 they  established Folk Dance House, a Manhattan school and center for folk dancing in  the old Humphrey-Weidman Dance Theater, which they directed until 1970. They also edited The Folk Dancer, a magazine, and taught at schools and colleges throughout the nation. Their costume collection was shown at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts in 1980.
        Mr. Herman is survived by two sisters, Helen Busser of Maple Heights, Ohio, and Julia Jurat of Parma, Ohio.
