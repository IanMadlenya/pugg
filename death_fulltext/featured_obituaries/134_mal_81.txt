        Antonio Cardinal Ribeiro of Lisbon, who helped maneuver the Roman Catholic Church into a pro-democracy stance after Portugal's right-wing dictatorship was overthrown in 1974, died today at Santo Antonio Hospital in suburban Lisbon. He was 69.
        The cause was lung cancer, Portuguese news reports said, citing church officials.
        Born on May 21, 1928, in Braga, he  attended Gregorian University in Rome from 1953 to 1958, and then returned to his hometown as a priest. He soon moved to Lisbon, where he appeared on a weekly religious television program from 1959 to 1965.
        He became a Bishop in 1967 and a Cardinal in 1973, a year before a leftist military coup ousted the dictatorship that had ruled Portugal for nearly five decades. The church hierarchy rarely spoke up for democracy during the dictatorship, but soon after the coup, the bishops issued a letter in favor of democracy.
        During the tense period of transition to democracy, which culminated in parliamentary elections in 1976, Cardinal Ribeiro also sought to maintain the church's privileges under the new Government, resisting efforts to remove a radio station from church control.
        He was also credited with helping to keep a lid on public tension through the church's muted reaction to the divorce law approved in 1975. After the Government approved an abortion law in 1984 despite his vigorous protests, he made a public appeal deploring the state of slum housing around the capital.
        He also helped to introduce a training program for the clergy with the aim of keeping them in closer contact with Portugal's people.
        The Goverment announced a national day of mourning for Wednesday in which flags are to fly at half-staff.
