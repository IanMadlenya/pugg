        Capt. Manley Lanier Carter Jr. of the Navy, the astronaut who was killed yesterday when a commuter airliner crashed in Georgia, was a physician who spent 120 hours in orbit aboard the space shuttle Discovery on a secret military venture.
        Captain Carter, 43 years old, played professional soccer with the Atlanta Chiefs before completing his medical studies at Emory University in 1973. Known as Sonny, Captain Carter was born in Macon, Ga., and became an astronaut six years ago. The mission specialist was assigned to the crew preparing for the maiden flight of the International Microgravity Laboratory.
        A graduate of Lanier High School in Macon, he received a degree in chemistry at Emory University before entering medical school. He became a soccer star in college and played in the North American Soccer League, now defunct, from 1970 to 1973. He relived that part of his youth when he took a soccer ball along for 79 orbits in November 1989.
        Captain Carter entered the Navy in 1974, graduated from flight-surgeon school in Pensacola, Fla., and served with Marine Corps units before earning his own aviator's wings in 1978. He became senior medical officer on the aircraft carrier Forrestal and served in a number of posts in this country and in the Mediterranean region before graduating from the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School in 1984. He was recruited by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration the same year. By then, he had logged some 3,000 flying hours and 160 carrier landings.
        His first mission began with a night shuttle launch at Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Nov. 22, 1989. The shuttle landed five days later at Edwards Air Force Base in California. He was to have made another space flight early next year.
        Captain Carter, a resident of Houston, was married to the former Dana Powell. The couple had two daughters, Olivia Elizabeth and Meredith Corvette.
