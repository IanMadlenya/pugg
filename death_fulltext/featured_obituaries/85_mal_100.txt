        Horace J. McAfee, a retired lawyer who had practiced in Manhattan for more than 40 years, died on Friday at Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. He was 88.
        The cause was heart failure, said his wife, Christine.
        Mr. McAfee graduated from Columbia Law School in 1931 and spent his entire legal career with the firm of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, serving for a time as its managing partner. He concentrated in the fields of banking and transportation law, retiring in 1976.
        He is survived by his wife, who lives in Irvington-on-Hudson, N.Y.; two sons, William G. of Hong Kong and Stuart R. of Chapel Hill, N.C., and a daughter, Mary Ann Baxter of Manhattan.
