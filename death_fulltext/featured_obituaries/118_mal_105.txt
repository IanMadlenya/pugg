        W. Donald McNeill, who won the 1940 United States tennis championship in a stirring upset of Bobby Riggs, died on Thursday at Indian River Memorial Hospital in Vero Beach, Fla. He was 78.
        His daughter Margaret McNeill-Law said the cause was complications from pneumonia. He had been in ill health for years.
        McNeill, the No. 1-ranked American in 1940, was an all-court player, as agile at the net as he was powerful from the backcourt, especially on the backhand side. He was ranked among the top 10 American players six times in the 1930's and 40's.
        He scored a grand slam double at the 1939 French Championships on clay, winning the men's singles in straight sets over Riggs, and the doubles title with his partner, Charles Harris, over the legendary French pair of Jean Borotra and Jacques Brugnon. And on the grass at Forest Hills, he added the 1944 United States doubles crown, with Robert Falkenburg.
        But 1940 was his banner year: he not only won the United States title by rallying from two sets down to unseat Riggs, the two-time defending champion, 4-6, 6-8, 6-3, 6-3, 7-5, but also won the national intercollegiate singles championship for Kenyon College of Ohio.
        His tennis career was interrupted by World War II, during which he served as an assistant naval attache in Buenos Aires.
        Following his military service, Mr. McNeill began a three-decade career as an advertising executive in New York City.
        Mr. McNeill is survived by his sister, Mary Helen Wolff of Spring, Tex.; three daughters, Melinda M. Kaiser of Stamford, Conn., Ms. McNeill-Law of Smyrna, Del., and Holly H. McNeill of Bainbridge Island, Wash., and four grandchildren.
