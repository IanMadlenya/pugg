        Henry D. Hecksher, a former Central Intelligence Agency officer, died of complications of Parkinson's disease yesterday at the Medical Center of Princeton, N.J. He was 79 years old and lived in Princeton.
        Mr. Hecksher was born in Hamburg, Germany, and was a lawyer and a judge there before emigrating to the United States in 1938. He joined the United States Army, rising to the rank of captain, took part in the Normandy invasion, and was wounded in Antwerp.
        He later became an intelligence officer with the Army and interrogated some of the top Nazi leaders, including Julius Streicher. He joined the Office of Strategic Services and in 1946 became head of its counterintelligence section in Berlin.
        He remained with the agency when it became the Central Intelligence Agency and later served with the State Department in Laos, Indonesia, Japan and Chile. He was the C.I.A. station chief in Santiago, Chile, during the time the C.I.A. spent more than $8 million in an unsuccessful effort to prevent the election of Salvador Allende Gossens and later sought to make it impossible for him to govern once he was elected.
        President Allende did not survive a military uprising against him in 1973. Mr. Hecksher retired in 1971. He is survived by a brother, William S. Heckscher of Princeton.
