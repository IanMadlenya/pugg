        Jimmy DeSana, a photographer known for his witty and occasionally gently erotic color images, died on Friday at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. He was 40 years old. The cause of death was not disclosed. Mr. DeSana was born in Detroit on Nov. 12, 1949, and moved to New York City in 1973. He had his first exhibition in 1979 at the Stefanotti gallery on West 57th Street. With such artists as Cindy Sherman, Richard Prince, Laurie Simmons and James Casebere he helped to make photography an important part of the art scene of the early 1980's.
        Like many of his contemporaries, Mr. DeSana specialized in tableaux or photography set up to offer a distinctly artificial alternative to the real world. His images had a Surrealist flair.  In recent years, he experimented with images made completely in a darkroom, suspending small motifs or mundane materials (including popcorn in one work) against fields of luminous color. His most recent exhibition was at the Pat Hearn gallery in SoHo in 1988.
        He is survived by his parents, James and Josephine DeSana, of Atlanta.
