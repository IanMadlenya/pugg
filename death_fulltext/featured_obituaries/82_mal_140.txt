        Lyman Stansky, who practiced law in Manhattan for seven decades and specialized in cases involving art objects, died on Nov. 21 at his home in Manhattan. He was 93.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        A native of Manhattan, Mr. Stansky received a full scholarship at Cornell University at the age of 16. He graduated with honors at Cornell and received his law degree there as well. He went into private practice in New York in the early 1920's and continued to see clients until his death. He represented the Arts and Antiques League of America for the last 20 years.
        He became a member of the New York County Lawyers Association in 1923 and served on its board from 1965 to 1970. Over the years, he also was a member of various committees, including ones on the judiciary, state legislation and professional ethics.
        Mr. Stansky is survived by his wife, Evelyne; a son, Peter, of Hillsborough Calif.; a daughter, Lady Marina Vaizey of London; and three grandchildren.
