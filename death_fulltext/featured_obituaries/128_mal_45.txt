        Eddie O'Toole, the United States national champion in the 10,000-meter run from 1946 to 1948, died last Friday at South Nassau Hospital in Oceanside, N.Y. He was 76.
        The cause was a heart attack, his son Kevin said.
        O'Toole, who graduated from Manhattan College, competed in the 10,000 meters at the 1948 Olympic Games, finishing ninth in an event won by the star runner Emil Zatopek of Czechoslovakia. After the race, O'Toole wrote a letter home describing how Zatopek ''floated by like a bar of Ivory on a Saturday night.''
        O'Toole later served as an official at the Millrose Games and other track and field events and had been retired from his position as a buyer for J.C. Penney Company.
        He lived in Rockville Centre, N.Y., and is survived by his wife, Mary Ann; 11 sons, Brian, Christopher, David, Edward, James, Kevin, Lawrence, Michael, Paul, Peter and Timothy; four daughters, Theresa Elliott, Barbara O'Leary, Mary Ann Timlen and Patricia Weil, and 27 grandchildren.
