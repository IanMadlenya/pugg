        In 1980, while serving on the Superior Court bench, Judge Birdsall sentenced John Harvey Adamson of Phoenix to die in the gas chamber in the murder of Don Bolles, a reporter for The Arizona Republic who was slain in 1976.
        Judge Birdsall also presided over the trial of Patrick Henry, a former physician whose 1977 plot to murder his former wife was the subject of a book and a television mini-series. He was convicted of attempted murder in 1979 and was sentenced to 5 to 15 years in prison.
