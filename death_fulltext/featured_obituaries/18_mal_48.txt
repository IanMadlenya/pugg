        Richard Schulze-Kossens, an SS officer who was an adjutant to Adolf Hitler for several years, died of lung cancer on July 3, according to the West German newspaper Die Welt. He was 73 years old.
        Mr. Schulze-Kossens served as one of Hitler's adjutants from 1941 to 1944. He was promoted to a lieutenant colonel in the SS in 1944 and named head of an SS training school.
        After the Nazi defeat in 1945, Mr. Schulze-Kossens spent three years in an American internment camp and later worked as a salesman and writer.
        Mr. Schulze-Kossens first served as an aide to Nazi Germany's Foreign Minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, and was present when Germany signed a nonaggression pact with the Soviet Union in 1939.
        Die Welt said more than 100 former members of SS units attended the funeral last Friday, many wearing the insignia of a group formed by SS veterans to assist comrades after the war.
        Hitler's last personal adjutant, Otto Guensche, reportedly accompanied Mr. Schulze-Kossens's widow to the services. Mr. Guensche reportedly was the Nazi aide who burned the bodies of Hitler and Eva Braun after they committed suicide in Hitler's Berlin bunker.
        The newspaper said Mr. Schulze-Kossens's casket was draped with wreathes bearing tributes from several former SS units.
        Die Welt said the former chief aide to SS leader Heinrich Himmler, Werner Grothmann, a long-time friend of Mr. Schulze-Kossens, was among two former Nazi officers who delivered eulogies.
