        Gen. Emile Mollard, a camouflage specialist who helped manufacture machine guns for the French Resistance in World War II, died on Wednesday, the newspaper Le Monde reported today. He was 96 years old.
        The newspaper report did not list a cause of death for General Mollard.
        A career military officer who held the rank of colonel when the war broke out, he quickly went underground after Germany defeated France in 1940. He founded the Camouflage du Materiel group of officers that specialized in camouflaging armored vehicles, weapons and amunitions for use by the Resistance. In 1943 he set up an underground unit that sent military personnel to the Free French army in North Africa.
