        The Spanish flamenco dancer and choreographer Antonio Ruiz Soler, whose ballet-inspired footwork and arm movements brought new prominence to male dancers on the Spanish stage in the 1940's, 50's and 60's, died on Monday at his home in Madrid. He was 74.
        The Associated Press reported that he died of a stroke after a period of poor health.
        For three decades starting in the 1940's, the man nicknamed "Antonio el Bailarin" ("Antonio the dancer") was credited with breaking new ground, first as a confidant and elegant dancing partner to his cousin Florencia Perez, known as  Rosario, and later as a choreographer influenced by Balanchine.
        He created choreography for Falla's "Three-Cornered Hat," Rodrigo's "Concierto Andaluz" and Albeniz's "Suite Iberica."
        During appearances in the United States that drew large, enthusiastic crowds, he danced in Ravel's "Bolero" in New York City and appeared in several Hollywood movies, including "Ziegfeld Girl" and "Honeymoon."
        Mr. Ruiz Soler's last performance as a dancer was in Sapporo, Japan, in 1979.
        Born in Seville in 1921, he began studying dance at age 6. Early in his career, he toured for a decade in Argentina and throughout North and South America, returning to Spain in 1949.
        His flamenco partnership with his cousin Rosario gained a following on both sides of the Atlantic. They were a stage attraction for 22 years, until they split up in 1952; they reunited from 1962 to 1965.
        In the 1950's, Mr. Ruiz Soler formed his own dance company in Spain. As a choreographer, "he modernized Spanish ballet, adding theatrical touches," said Roger Salas, dance critic of the Madrid daily El Pais. But his emphasis on pirouettes and his attention to costumes and sets led some flamenco purists to criticize his work, Mr. Salas said.
        He is survived by two brothers and two sisters.
