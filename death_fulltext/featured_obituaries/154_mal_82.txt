        John D. Le Vien, a documentary film producer nominated for two Oscars, died on Nov. 9 at a hospital in London, where he had lived for the last 30 years. He was 81.
        Mr. Le Vien was also executive producer of ''Black Fox,'' a 90-minute film about Hitler that was narrated by Marlene Dietrich. It won the Academy Award in 1963 for best documentary. Mr. Le Vien was nominated for Academy Awards as the producer of two documentary features, ''The Finest Hours'' in 1965 and ''A King's Story'' in 1968. Much of his work evolved from his friendships with Churchill and the Duke of Windsor.
        John Douglas Le Vien, known as Jack, was born in New York in 1918. From 1939 to 1940 he worked as an office boy, film editor and reporter for Pathe News in the United States. In 1941 he entered the Army as a second lieutenant; he had assignments in the Army's Bureau of Public Relations in Washington and in London, becoming a high-ranking press aide to Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower.
        Mr. Le Vien was chief press officer with the Allied Task Force invading Algeria, and in Tunisia he organized an official press camp. He did the same in Italy, France and Germany. He took part in four invasion landings, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel; he later became a colonel in the Army Reserves. He was awarded the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star and the French Legion of Honor.
        From 1946 to 1956 Mr. Le Vien was news editor, general manager, editor in chief and vice president of Pathe News. When Pathe News shut down in 1956, he joined Hearst Metrotone News in New York as director of production.
        Three years later Mr. Le Vien left to be a motion picture and television producer, leading his own company, Le Vien International Productions. He also wrote four books, ''The Valiant Years,'' ''The Finest Hours,'' ''The Duchess of Windsor'' and ''Churchill and the Generals.''
        He is survived by his wife, Josephine.
