        H. Otto Hirschler, an electronics expert who helped build the complex controls of rockets to propel American astronauts to the moon, died on  Feb. 2 at his home in Huntsville, Ala. He was 87.
        Mr. Hirschler was one of the 118 German V-2 rocket engineers rounded up by the Allied authorities at the end of World War II and brought to the United States. Led by Dr. Wernher von Braun, they worked for the United States Army Missile Command in Huntsville.
        Mr. Hirschler was the last of the German scientists, in 1970, to lose his Army job. But like most of the others he transferred to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's flight center in Huntsville. There he contributed to the unmanned and manned moon flights of the 1960's and 1970's.
        He was teamed with Dr. Helmut Hölzer, a specialist in calculating rocket trajectories and built a flight simulator well before the development of computers capable of such complicated estimations. They devised an electronic system that simulated the flight of a rocket, taking into account gravity, thrust and other aerodynamic forces without actually launching anything.
        Henry Otto Hirschler was born in Darmstadt, Germany, and studied electrical engineering in Germany before joining Dr. von Braun's research and development team in the 1930's. The group eventually moved to Peenemünde, a small fishing village on the Baltic that became a launching pad for Germany's V-1 and V-2 rocket attacks on Britain during the war.
        Mr. Hirschler is survived by a daughter, Elke Hodgin of Merritt Island, Fla; five sons, Gunther, of Atlanta, and Wolf, John, Ed and Hartmut, all of Huntsville; five grandchildren; and five great-grandsons. His wife, Ilse, died in 1989.
