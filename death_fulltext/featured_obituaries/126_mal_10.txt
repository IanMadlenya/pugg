        Dr. Felix N. Rutledge, a gynecologic surgeon who is credited with developing the medical specialty dealing with cancer in the female genital tract, died on June 21 at Methodist Hospital in Houston. He was 79 and lived in Geneva, Tex.
        The cause was complications of a stroke, family members said.
        There were no doctors working primarily in his career specialty, called gynecological oncology, in the 1950's when Dr. Rutledge joined the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, part of the University of Texas, in Houston. Today there are about 600 such specialists, said Dr. Julian P. Smith, who recently retired as chief of gynecological oncology at the University of Maryland.
        Dr. Smith said Dr. Rutledge had traveled widely to promote the development of the field.
        Felix Rutledge was born in Anniston, Ala., and received his M.D. at Johns Hopkins University. He was the first chairman of gynecology when M. D. Anderson opened in 1954,  and he held that position until his retirement in 1986.
        He is survived by his wife, Dorothy; a son, Don, of Sugar Land, Tex., and two grandsons.
