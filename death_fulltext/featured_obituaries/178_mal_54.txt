        Jerry Jerome, a tenor saxophone player who was a featured soloist with the Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman, Red Norvo and Artie Shaw orchestras in the Big Band era, died at his home here on Saturday. He was 89.
        Mr. Jerome later became a successful musical director and conductor on radio and television and established a music business, scoring and arranging commercial jingles, including ''Winston tastes good, like a cigarette should.''
        Mr. Jerome, who lived in Sarasota since the mid-1970's, was the resident host of the city's annual jazz festival. He was playing until recently at festivals and at local clubs and was scheduled to perform on Dec. 10 for the Charlotte County Jazz Society.
        He also continued to record. Three years ago Arbors Records released a CD, ''Something Old, Something New,'' with tunes recorded at recent sessions as well as songs from years ago with stars like Teddy Wilson, Bob Haggart and Bobby Hackett.
        The CD's sequel, ''Something Borrowed, Something Blue,'' is scheduled for release in December.
        Born in Brooklyn, Mr. Jerome started playing the saxophone while in high school in Plainfield, N.J. He attended college and medical school at the University of Alabama.
        In 1936 he toured the country with the bandleader Harry Reser and his Clicquot Club Eskimos. He moved on to Miller's original orchestra and then to the Norvo band. He joined the Benny Goodman orchestra at the height of its popularity, in 1938.
        When Goodman broke up his band in 1940, Mr. Jerome joined the Artie Shaw group. While with Shaw he appeared in the film ''Second Chorus'' with Fred Astaire and Burgess Meredith.
        Mr. Jerome is survived by his wife, Elaine; four sons, Al, Bill, Jim and Jerry; a stepson, David Frankel; two daughters, Joanne Kelvin and Barbara Mazzei; two sisters, Dorothy Kahn and Elsie Abeles; a brother, Irv; 11 grandchildren; and a great-grandchild.
