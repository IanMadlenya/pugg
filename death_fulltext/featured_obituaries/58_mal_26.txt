        Richard Clark Thomas, an official with the Federal Election Commission and a former Secretary of State in Vermont, died Saturday. He was 54 years old and lived in Woodbridge, Va.
        The cause of death was throat cancer, said Kent Cooper, an assistant staff director of the commission.
        A graduate of Middlebury College in Vermont, Mr. Thomas was elected to the first of four two-year terms as Secretary of State in Vermont in 1968.
        In 1977 he joined the election commission as Director of State Relations, serving as a liaison between the commission and state and local election officials.
        He is survived by his wife, Patricia L. McGlynn Thomas; twin daughters, Lisa Rae and Leslie Lynn, and a son, Richard Jr., all living at home; his mother, Amelia Anne Woodman Thomas, of Merritt Island, Fla.; three sisters, Mary Ellen Austin of Auburn, Me., Jane Forest of Wilmington, Mass., and Laurie Thomas of Merritt Island; and a brother, Stephen Thomas, of Tinmouth, Vt.
