        Sir Trenchard Cox, one of the most successful and personable British museum directors of recent decades, died on Dec. 21, London newspapers reported. He was 90 and lived in London.
        As director and secretary of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London from 1956 to 1966, he created its conservation department and reorganized the library. He oversaw the acquisition of art and the staging of exhibitions at the museum, which is one of London's treasures.
        Earlier, as director of the City of Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery from 1944 to 1955, he transformed a provincial institution into one of England's finest museums. He supervised the repair of war-damaged buildings, rearranged the display of the museum collections and created a successful support group, Friends of the Museum.
        George Trenchard Cox was born on July 31, 1905. He was educated at Eton and King's College, Cambridge. From 1929 to 1932 he worked as an unpaid intern at the National Gallery and in the prints and drawings department of the British Museum. He also spent a semester studying art history at Berlin University, and  briefly attended the Sorbonne in Paris.
        In the 1930's he worked as an assistant at the Wallace Collection, Britain's  leading repository of 18th-century French fine and decorative arts. At the outbreak of World War II, he organized the collection's removal to safety outside London. During the war he worked at the Home Office.
        After his retirement from the museum he served as a member of Britain's Standing Commission of Museums and Galleries until 1977. He was knighted in 1961 and was elected an honorary fellow of the Royal Academy in 1981.
        He was the author of books about the European Renaissance, Pieter Bruegel and curatorship, among other subjects.
        His wife, the former Mary Desiree Anderson, died in 1973.
