        Leo McKern, the veteran stage and screen actor who became best known for his television role as the shrewd and exasperating British barrister ''Rumpole of the Bailey,'' died yesterday at a nursing home near his home in Bath, England. He was 82.
        He had been ill for some time, his agent, Richard Hatton, said.
        ''Rumpole,'' a curious and popular mix of comedy and courtroom drama, ran intermittently for 44 episodes from 1975 to 1992. The series appeared on public television in the United States.
        In the words of John J. O'Connor, the former television critic of The New York Times, Mr. McKern was the defense barrister Horace Rumpole ''down to the very last wheeze.''
        ''Looking like a sack of slightly soiled laundry,'' Mr. O'Connor wrote in 1984, ''Horace growls constantly and puffs away on dreadful little cigars, scattering ashes recklessly, while periodically reverting to the Great Poets to underscore his more profound points.''
        As played by Mr. McKern, Rumpole has a love for claret, interior monologues and a wife, Hilda, whom he refers to as ''she who must be obeyed.'' Mr. McKern became so identified in the public mind with legal traditions that in 1987, Smith Barney used him as the voice of authority in its television ads, replacing the late John Houseman.
        Leo McKern was born in Sydney, Australia, on March 16, 1920. At the age of 15, while working as an engineer's apprentice, he lost his left eye. The glass eye that replaced it added to his distinctively preoccupied appearance.
        He made his stage debut in Sydney in 1944 and two years later moved to England. Some of his early British stage appearances came at the Old Vic Theater from 1949 to 1952, and at the Shakespeare Memorial Theater at Stratford-Upon-Avon from 1952 to 1954. Mr. McKern made his screen debut with ''Murder in the Cathedral'' (1952) and went on to play substantial roles in ''A Tale of Two Cities'' (1958), ''The Mouse that Roared'' (1959) and ''Scent of Mystery'' (1960), among others. He was especially memorable as Clang, the head of a sacrificial cult, in the Beatles' movie ''Help!'' (1965) and as Cromwell, the prosecutor of Sir Thomas More, in ''A Man for All Seasons'' (1966).
        He also had major roles in ''Ryan's Daughter'' (1970), ''The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother'' (1975), ''The Omen'' (1976), ''The Blue Lagoon'' (1980), ''The French Lieutenant's Woman'' (1981) and ''Molokai: The Story of Father Damien'' (1999).
        Mr. McKern also played numerous television roles, including the bungling train robber in Disney's ''The Horse Without a Head'' (1963), David Ben-Gurion in ''House on Garibaldi Street'' (1979), Gloucester in ''King Lear'' (1984) and Duke Phillip in ''Good King Wenceslas (1994).
        Mr. McKern's memoir, ''Just Resting,'' was published by Methuen in 1988. The same year he was awarded the Order of Australia.
        He is survived by his wife, Jane Holland, and two daughters, Abigail and Harriet. Abigail McKern is a British actress who appeared alongside her father in several ''Rumpole'' episodes.
        Mr. McKern had the enthusiasitic support of John Mortimer, the British lawyer and playwright who created the Rumpole books, to play the role on television. He said of Mr. McKern, ''He not only played the character Rumpole, he added to it, brightened it and brought it fully to life.''
