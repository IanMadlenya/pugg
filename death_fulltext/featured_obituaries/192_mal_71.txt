        Francesco Trussardi, the chairman of one of Italy's leading fashion and leather goods manufacturers, died on Sunday after his Ferrari crashed into a lamppost near Bergamo in northern Italy, according to the Italian police. He was 29.
        Mr. Trussardi became chairman of the family business in 1999 after his father, Nicola Trussardi, died of injuries suffered in a similar automobile accident.
        The Trussardi concern, founded in 1910 by Dante Trussardi as a small-town glove manufacturer, was eventually transformed from a supplier of tasteful leather goods to the carriage trade into an internationally known manufacturer of stylish luggage and ready-to-wear exotica, from buffalo hide trousers to eel skin trench coats, as well as more conventional forms of apparel. Retail sales for the company, which operates 8 company-owned and 10 franchised free-standing stores worldwide, were $478.1 million last year.
        Francesco Trussardi was born in Bergamo on Jan. 16, 1974, and received both his undergraduate and master's degrees in business from Bocconi University. His survivors include his mother, Marialuisa Trussardi; two sisters, Beatrice and Gaia; and a brother, Tomasso.
        Under the stewardship of Mr. Trussardi's father, the Trussardi brand expanded widely in the 1980's, venturing into the worlds of high design, jewelry and accessories. Its first ready-to-wear collection was shown in 1983 in the foyer of La Scala opera house. The most recent show, of men's wear, took place in a corporately owned palace nearby on Jan. 15, the day before Mr. Trussardi turned 29. It followed the announcement of a new partnership with Vestimenta S.p.A., an Italian men's wear conglomerate, intended to diversify the Trussardi brand globally.
