        Jack McMahon, who spent 37 years in the National Basketball Association as player, coach and administrator, died in his sleep today. He was 60 years old.
        Mike Nelson, a spokesman for the Golden State Warriors, said Mr. McMahon died in Chicago. Mr. McMahon was an assistant coach with the Warriors at the time of his death and also was the team's director of player personnel.
        Mr. McMahon, a native of New York City, played college basketball at St. John's University. In his senior year, 1952, he captained the Redmen to a 25-6 record and a berth in the National Collegiate Athletic Association championship game, which the team lost to Kansas.
        Mr. McMahon played eight years in the N.B.A., with the Rochester Royals in 1952-55, and the St. Louis Hawks in 1955-60. He was a starting guard on the Hawks' 1958 championship team.
        As head coach of the expansion Chicago Zephyrs in 1962, Mr. McMahon gave Don Nelson, now the Warriors' coach, his first chance to play after Mr. Nelson joined the league as a third-round pick out of Iowa.
        Mr. McMahon became head coach of the Cincinnati Royals in 1963, compiling a four-season record of 187-134 and making the playoffs each year.
        In 1967, Mr. McMahon became the first head coach and general manager of the San Diego Rockets, where he coached Pat Riley, the Los Angeles Lakers' coach. He left San Diego midway through his third season with a 61-129 record.
        He is survived by his wife, Kay, of San Leandro, and three children, Jack Jr., Brian and Katherine.
