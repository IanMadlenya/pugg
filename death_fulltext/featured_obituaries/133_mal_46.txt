        The French baritone Michel Roux, who sang frequently with the Paris Opera and at the Glyndebourne festival in England, died on Wednesday in Paris. He was 73.
        Mr. Roux, born in Angouleme, France, studied in Bordeaux and Paris before making his operatic debut in 1948 in a production of ''Lakme'' at the Opera-Comique. He remained a principal singer at that house until 1955. His debut at La Scala in Milan, Italy, came in 1953 in a role that became central to his repertory, Golaud in Debussy's ''Pelleas et Melisande.''
        His 1956 Glyndebourne debut was as Count Almaviva in Mozart's ''Nozze di Figaro.'' His success began his affiliation with Glyndebourne, where he sang annually until 1970, primarily in operas by Mozart and Rossini. He also sang with the Lyric Opera of Chicago, the Vienna Staatsoper and the Deutsche Oper in Berlin, and worked with the conductor Herbert von Karajan at La Scala.
        Mr. Roux was known as an intelligent singer and a vivid stage actor. During the 1950's he appeared in a series of comic French films directed by Julien Duvivier.
