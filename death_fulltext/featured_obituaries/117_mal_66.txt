        Dr. Robert Edward Bannon, an educator and researcher in optics and optometry, died on Sept. 16 at the Oakwood Health Care Center in Amherst, N.Y. He was 86 and lived in Amherst, near Buffalo.
        Born in Schenectady, Dr. Bannon graduated from Columbia College and received a doctorate in optometry at Dartmouth Medical School in 1940. While at Dartmouth he worked with a group of scientists who laid the theoretical foundations for the concept of perception that became a basis for contemporary cognitive science.
        He had been named a fellow at Dartmouth's medical school in 1935 and, joining the faculty, advanced from instructor to assistant professor in physiological optics. He moved from Dartmouth to Columbia University in 1947 and conducted his research there until 1958.
        Moving to Buffalo in 1958, he accepted a faculty appointment at the University of Buffalo Medical School. He also worked at the Buffalo outlet of the American Optical Company, since acquired by Leica of Germany and renamed Leica Science Instrument Company. He remained active as a consultant for Leica at his death.
        Dr. Bannon is survived by his wife of 57 years, Frances Cacioppo Bannon; a son, Anthony, of Rochester, and two grandsons.
