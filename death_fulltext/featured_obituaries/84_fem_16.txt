        Joan M. Auten, an aide at the United States Embassy in London for 44 years before her retirement a decade ago, died on Jan. 7 in Wellington Hospital in London. She was 76.
        The cause was pneumonia, said a friend, Michael Clark.
        Miss Auten headed the visitors' office at the embassy and was in charge of arrangements for visiting dignitaries.
