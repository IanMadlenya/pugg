        Stanley J. Harte, a lawyer and real-estate developer in New York and Florida, died on Tuesday at his home in Palm Beach. He was 83.
        The cause was heart failure, said Alisan Harte Shenberg, his daughter.
        Mr. Harte, whose grandfather and father were real-estate developers in Manhattan, began his career as a trial lawyer. He unsuccessfully fought plans in 1936 by Robert Moses, the New York City Parks Commissioner, to tear down the Central Park Casino, a city landmark that was built in 1863.
        In 1945 Mr. Harte opened a real-estate office on the 82d floor of the Empire State Building and for the next 20 years erected dozens of apartment buildings, day-care centers and shopping centers in Manhattan and Brooklyn and around New York State. He also developed buildings for the United States Post Office.
        In the late 1950's he headed a group that built cooperative apartments in Lincoln Square for middle-income people as part of a city slum clearance project.
        He moved to Palm Beach in 1962 and built a string of shopping centers and malls along Florida's east coast, from Daytona Beach to Fort Lauderdale.
        He is best known in Florida for his renovation of the Biltmore Hotel in Palm Beach, which he bought from John D. MacArthur in 1977. Mr. Harte converted the historic Mediterranean-style hotel into condominiums.
        He was born in Manhattan and graduated from New York University in 1931. He graduated from Columbia Law School in 1934.
        He is survived by his second wife, Ann; a son, Craig, of San Francisco; four daughters, Ms. Shenberg, Gail Harte Greenberg, who is a four-time world bridge champion, and Deanne Kraus, all of New York, and Barbara Katz of Palm Beach; 10 grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren. A son, Stanley J. Harte Jr., died in 1991.
