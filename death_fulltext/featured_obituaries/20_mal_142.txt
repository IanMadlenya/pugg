        Irwin Novograd, who with his family has operated the Claremont Riding Academy on West 89th Street in Manhattan for 45 years, died of a stroke Monday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. He was 81 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        The Claremont, the oldest operating stable in Manhattan and the only one renting horses to the public, was bought in 1943 by Mr. Novograd, who had been a bookkeeper for the former owner.
        Mr. Novograd was born in Poland and came to New York in 1914. When he took over the Claremont, which was built in 1892 between Columbus and Amsterdam Avenues, it was one of a dwindling number of stables in Manhattan. Carriage horses that once dominated the city streets had all but disappeared.
        Other stables, several of them on West 89th Street, were converted to garages, but the Claremont remained, offering riding lessons and renting and boarding horses.
        Mr. Novograd is survived by his wife, the former Bernice Landau; two sons, Paul, of Manhattan, and Bruce, of Stamford, Conn.; a daughter, Linda Luxemburg of Manhattan; a sister, Lee Bernstein of Manhattan; two brothers, Morris Novag of Manhattan, and Dr. David Newton of Brookville, L.I., and six grandchildren.
