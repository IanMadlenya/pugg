        Bob Peck, who appeared in the film ''Jurassic Park'' as well as on stage and television in Britain, died on Sunday in London.
        He was 53 and had cancer, The Associated Press reported.
        Mr. Peck, who lived in London, was much better known in Britain than in the United States, where his biggest role was that of a game warden, Robert Muldoon, in ''Jurassic Park,'' Steven Spielberg's 1993 dinosaur film.
        In Britain, Mr. Peck started as an actor with the National Theater and the Royal Shakespeare Company, performing in plays like ''Nicholas Nickleby,'' ''King Lear'' and ''The Tempest.''
        He later starred in numerous television dramas, including the popular 1985 television series ''Edge of Darkness.'' In the series, which featured music by Eric Clapton, Mr. Peck played Craven, a grief-stricken police officer looking in an underground nuclear reactor for clues to the death of his daughter.
        Mr. Peck was regarded as an adaptable actor with a gift for portraying Everyman. ''He was a hero, but without the heroics,'' said an obituary in The Guardian. ''We looked at the television screen and saw ourselves.''
        Mr. Peck was born on Aug. 23, 1945, in Leeds, England, and was a graduate of the Leeds College of Art.
        He is survived by his wife, Jill, two daughters and a son.
