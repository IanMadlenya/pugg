        William J. Cagney, a brother of James Cagney and the producer of such films as ''The Time of Your Life'' and ''Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye,'' died of a heart attack Sunday at Hoag Memorial Hospital here. He was 82 years old.
        William Cagney was born March 26, 1905, in New York. He worked as an actor, a talent agent and an associate producer at Warner Brothers before starting Cagney Productions in 1942.
        ''He managed his brother Jim's career,'' his niece, Terry Cagney Morrison, said. ''Bill was the business brains of the family.''
        As an associate producer, his work included ''Yankee Doodle Dandy,'' the 1942 film that earned James Cagney an Academy Award.
        At Cagney Productions he produced such films starring his brother as ''Johnny Come Lately'' (1943), ''The Time of Your Life'' (1948), ''Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye'' (1950) and ''A Lion Is in the Streets'' (1953). Also starring in ''Johnny Come Lately and ''A Lion Is in the Streets'' was his sister, Jeanne.
        Mr. Cagney is survived by a daughter, Jill Simpson, and two sons, William and Steven.
