        Kiki Mason, a brash advocate for people with AIDS who chronicled his own struggle with the disease in a column for Poz magazine, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 36.
        The cause was complications from AIDS, said a friend, David France.
        Mr. Mason was vice president of the board of the Community Research Initiative on AIDS, a nonprofit, independent organization that explores new medical treatments.
        Born Curtis J. Mason, he grew up in Pittsburgh and graduated from Hunter College. He was active in the gay-rights movement in New York in the 1980's, serving as a spokesman for the Coalition for Lesbian and Gay Rights.
        In 1993, Mr. Mason founded a group called Lesion Liberation to lobby for better medical treatment for those suffering -- as he was -- from Kaposi's sarcoma, an AIDS-related cancer that results in disfiguring lesions.
        His column in Poz, a magazine about H.I.V. and AIDS, was called "Life" and had run regularly since the first issue in April 1994. Most recently, Mr. Mason  republished a two-year-old declaration:
        "I am not dying; I am being murdered. I am being sold down the river by people within this community who claim to be helping people with AIDS."
        Mr. Mason is survived by his mother, Marilyne.
