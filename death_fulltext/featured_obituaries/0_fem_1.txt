        Era Bell Thompson, an author and longtime editor at Ebony magazine, was found dead in her home here Tuesday, said Herbert Nipson, executive editor of the magazine. Miss Thompson was 80 years old.
        ''I worked with her for 30 years -she was an advocate of women's lib long before it became popular,'' Mr. Nipson said. ''She did stories in Africa, India, Australia, South America and various islands in the South Pacific.''
        Miss Thompson also reported from Israel and once spent a night in jail in South Africa in 1957. She was among 50 black women included in ''Women in Courage,'' a touring photography exhibit to commemorate Black History Month.
        Born in Des Moines, Iowa, she was reared in Driscoll, N.D. She studied journalism, she once said, ''not knowing black journalists couldn't get jobs,'' and earned a degree at Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa.
        When she moved to Chicago in 1933, she did housework for a living. Later she received a fellowship to write a book about her girlhood in North Dakota. ''American Daughter'' was published in 1946.
        After becoming editor of Negro Digest, Miss Thompson joined Ebony in 1947. She was its co-managing editor from 1951 to 1964 and international editor from 1964 until she retired several years ago.
