        Yuri Dyshlenko, a Russian artist who emigrated to the United States in 1989, died on Monday at his home in Richmond Hills, Queens. He was 58.
        The cause was lung cancer, said his wife, Alexandra.
        As an unofficial artist in the pre-glasnost Soviet Union, Mr. Dyshlenko pursued his work without Government sanction or support. His paintings were also stylistically at odds with much underground art, which favored the Conceptual, because of his emphasis on a meticulous, if oddly disjointed, realism. This he developed by painting from small collages that he made from magazine clippings.
        Mr. Dyshlenko was born in Novosibirsk in 1936, studied art at the Leningrad Polytechnic Institute and eked out a living by doing book illustration. In 1983, A-ya, an underground publication about unofficial art in the Soviet Union published in Paris, included an illustrated article on his work. The magazine was seen by the American art dealer Phyllis Kind and she gave Mr. Dyshlenko his first solo exhibition in her New York gallery in 1988.
        Many examples of his work are included in the collection of unofficial Russian art that Norton Dodge, a retired economics professor at St. Mary's College in Maryland, recently gave to the Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey. In recent years his work has also been acquired by numerous Russian museums. At the time of his death, Mr. Dyshlenko was writing a book on color theory underwritten by Mr. Dodge.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a brother, Boris, of St. Petersburg, and a daughter, Tonya, of Richmond Hills.
