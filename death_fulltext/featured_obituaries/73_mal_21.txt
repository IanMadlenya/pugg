        Akira Okaya, a physicist who worked with fiber optics and laser technology, died on Jan. 20 at Norwalk Hospital in Connecticut. He was 72 and lived in New Canaan, Conn.
        The cause of death was respiratory failure after a brief illness, his family said.
        Dr. Okaya, who was born in Kobe, Japan, held a doctorate in physics from Kyoto University, where he also taught. His research led to a Fulbright scholarship at Columbia University as a postdoctoral fellow in the Radiation Laboratories. There, in the late 1950's, he worked in solid-state physics, microwave electronics and laser research.
        A United States citizen since 1969, Dr. Okaya held senior positions in a number of corporations, most recently as a vice president and consultant with Sumitomo Electric U.S.A. in New York City. Earlier, from 1969 to 1975, he operated his own business, Optical Data Processing, in New Canaan.
        He held numerous American and foreign patents in optical and microwave communications, lasers and accoustic and optical devices and systems.
        He is survived by two daughters, Amy Okaya of St. Paul, and Sara Okaya Gangai of Hampton, N.H.; two daughters from a previous marriage, Midori Iwashita and Mariko Tsukamoto, both of whom live in Japan; two sisters, Atsuko Tanaka and Masako Kobayashi, both of Tokyo, and five grandchildren.
