        Professor Burtt continued to write and publish after he retired from Cornell in 1960. Six of his books, most of them on the philosophy of religion, are in print, including ''The Human Journey,'' completed when he was 90.
        He was born in Groton, Mass., and graduated from Yale University. He held bachelor's and master's degrees from Union Theological Seminary and a doctorate from Columbia University. He joined Cornell in 1932 and held the Susan Linn Sage chair. Previously, he taught at Columbia and the University of Chicago.
        Surviving are two daughters, Virginia Burtt of Sea Ranch, Calif., and Winifred Brinster of Seattle.
