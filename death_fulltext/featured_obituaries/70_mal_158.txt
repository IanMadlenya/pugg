        Dr. Max Kronstein, a New York research chemist with at least 20 patents to his credit, died on Sunday at his home in Riverdale in the Bronx. He was 97 years old.
        He died after a brief illness, his family said.
        A native of Basel, Switzerland, Dr. Kronstein earned his doctorate at the University of Leipzig in 1922.
        He taught at New York University's College of Engineering from 1946 to 1955 and stayed on as a research scientist until 1973 when, well into his 70's, he moved to Manhattan College in Riverdale as a research associate in the chemistry department. The college said yesterday that he had continued to work in his laboratory until about a month ago. His specialties were polymers and surface coatings.
        He is survived by his second wife, the former Marion Meaker Ward; two daughters, Marianne R. Luetke of Cortlandt Manor, N.Y., and Elisabeth Ward of Intervale, N.H.; two grandchildren, and one great-grandson.
