        Luis Carlos Prestes, who led Brazil's Communist opposition for half a century, died on Wednesday of cancer, doctors said. He was 92 years old.
        Mr. Prestes had suffered from leukemia, said Dr. Peylor Meira, administrator of the Beneficiencia Portuguesa Hospital, where Mr. Prestes died.
        In 1924, as a young army officer, Mr. Prestes was a leading figure in an abortive military revolt. After its failure, he led a band of rebel troops, known as the Prestes Column, on a three-year, 14,000-mile trek through the remote Brazilian interior in a futile attempt to stir peasant opposition to the Government. Eventually, the rebels went into exile in Bolivia.
        Later, Mr. Prestes became leader of the Brazilian Communist Party and served as a senator.
        In the 1980's, Mr. Prestes accused the Brazilian Communist Party of abandoning Marxist-Leninist dogma. He was removed from the leadership in 1980 and expelled in 1984.
        He campaigned for Leonel Brizola, a center-left candidate, in the 1989 presidential election, won by Fernando Collor de Mello.
        Mr. Prestes's body is to lie in state at the Rio de Janeiro State Assembly before burial at Sao Joao Batista cemetery, Dr. Meira said.
        Mr. Prestes is survived by his wife, Maria do Carmo Ribeiro, and 10 children.
