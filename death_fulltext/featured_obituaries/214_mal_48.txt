        Jimmy Lovelace, a veteran bebop drummer who performed with some of New York's leading jazz musicians, died on Oct. 29 at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. He was 64 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, his wife, Okaru Hoshino, said.
        Mr. Lovelace was a regular fixture at Smalls, a West Village club that closed last year. He often played there with the pianist Frank Hewitt, and with the band Across 7 Street, featuring Chris Byars on saxophone, Ari Roland on bass and Sacha Perry on piano. Mr. Lovelace also performed with the guitarists Wes Montgomery and George Benson, the pianist Junior Mance and the clarinetist Tony Scott.
        James Ross Lovelace was born in Kansas City, Mo., on Feb. 6, 1940. An active performer from the 1960's on, he appeared on more than two dozen recordings, including ''Tony Scott''; ''The George Benson Cookbook''; ''We Loved You,'' by Mr. Hewitt; and ''The Eternal Pyramid,'' by Across 7 Street.
        Besides his wife, Mr. Lovelace is survived by a sister, Myra Hobson, of Kansas City.
