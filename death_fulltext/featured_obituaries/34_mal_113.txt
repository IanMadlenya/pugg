        Horace W. McCurdy, a maritime construction executive whose company built the Mercer Island floating bridge, died Monday. He was 90 years old and lived in Seattle.
        He joined Puget Sound Bridge and Dredging as a timekeeper and worked his way up, buying the company with a partner in 1929. The company built more than 100 ships, as well as air bases and the 800-mile-long Distant Early Warning radar line in Alaska.
        Mr. McCurdy is survived by his wife, Catharine; a son, James, and three grandchildren.
