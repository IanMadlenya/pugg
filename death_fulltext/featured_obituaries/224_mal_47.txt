        Michael deCourcy Hinds, a former national correspondent for The New York Times, died on Monday at the NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital in Manhattan. He was 58 and a Manhattan resident.
        The cause was complications of multiple myeloma, said his wife, Susan Lapinski.
        Mr. Hinds joined The Times in 1978 and wrote about consumer issues in New York and urban and national issues in Washington. From 1989 to 1994, when he left the paper, he was the bureau chief in Philadelphia.
        From 1995 to 2000, Mr. Hinds was vice president and executive editor of Public Agenda, a nonprofit policy research organization. There he wrote a citizens' guide to public issues, including school reform and campaign finance.
        In September 2000, Mr. Hinds joined the staff of the Carnegie Corporation of New York as chief writer, a position he held until his death.
        Mr. Hinds was born in Boston on Jan. 10, 1947. He graduated from Boston University, and was a Peace Corps volunteer in Senegal.
        He is survived by Ms. Lapinski, editor in chief of Working Mother magazine; two daughters, Susannah deCourcy Hinds, and Jessica deCourcy Hinds, of Brooklyn; and two brothers, Richard deCourcy Hinds, of Washington, and John Lie-Nielsen, of Atlanta.
