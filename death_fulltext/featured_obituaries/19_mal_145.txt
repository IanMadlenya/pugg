        Mr. DeLue was a prolific artist who maintained a career through commissions for large-scale sculptures that, he said, ''are intended to last for thousands of years.''
        He made sculptures for Omaha Beach on the Normandy coast of France and for the Federal Court Building in Philadelphia. He created the Boy Scout Memorial Tribute in Washington, the Harvey Firestone Memorial in Akron, Ohio, and ''George Washington Kneeling at Prayer at Valley Forge, Pa.''
        His ''Rocket Thrower'' was the theme sculpture for the 1964-65 World's Fair.
        He was a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters, the National Sculpture Society and the National Academy of Design.
        There are no survivors.
