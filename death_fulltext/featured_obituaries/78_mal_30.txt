        Russell A. Pendergast, a senior executive of the Rockefeller Group in New York for the last 10 years, died on Friday at his home in Wilton, Conn. He was 57 years old.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        At the time of his death he was the vice president of corporate communications, personnel and administration for the group, making him the spokesman in many of the company's large-scale property and real-estate transactions. The Rockefeller Group describes itself as one of the nation's leading privately held companies in real estate, real-estate services, entertainment and telecommunications.
        A native of New York City, Mr. Pendergast graduated from Manhattan College and started his career as an editor of trade publications at McGraw-Hill Inc. He then spent 17 years with the Olin Corporation, filling various public relations posts at the multinational metals and chemicals concern.
        He joined the Rockefeller Group in 1983 as director of public relations, became a vice president three years later and took on the added responsibilities for personnel and administration two years ago. He spoke for the company when it bought the land under Rockefeller Center from Columbia University in 1985, when it sold its interest in the Exxon Building and bought the Time & Life Building in 1986, during the renovation and reopening of the Rainbow Room the next year, and at the long-term lease agreement between Rockefeller Center and NBC, among other things.
        He is survived by his wife of 31 years, Joan Montuori Pendergast; two sons, Damian and Christian, both of Wilton; his mother, Clotilde Pendergast of Riverdale, the Bronx; a brother, John T., of Troy, N.Y.; and two sisters, Mary Pendergast of Riverdale, and Carroll Pendergast Stein of New City, N.Y.
