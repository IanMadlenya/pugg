        Dr. Paul Henry Mussen, a child psychologist who wrote a classic textbook and taught for 30 years at the University of California at Berkeley, died July 7 in Berkeley. He was 78.
        The cause was prostate cancer, the university said.
        Dr. Mussen's books focus on interactions between parent and child, an emerging concern in the 1950's when the first of them were published; they were widely translated, and a number of them remain in print.
        He was the principal author of the seminal ''Child Development and Personality,'' first published in 1956. It was a standard for 30 years and made Dr. Mussen the best-selling author at Harper Textbooks for years.
        He wrote ''The Psychological Development of the Child'' (Prentice-Hall, 1963), and was the co-author of ''Roots of Caring, Sharing and Helping'' (W. H. Freeman, 1977), ''Psychological Development: A Life-Span Approach'' (Harper, 1979) and ''The Roots of Prosocial Behavior in Children'' (Cambridge University Press, 1989), among others.
        Dr. Mussen was the main editor of the four-volume ''Handbook of Child Psychology'' (Wiley, 1983). He also edited the Annual Review of Psychology from 1968 to 1973.
        Paul Mussen was born in Paterson, N.J., and graduated in 1942 from Stanford University, where he received an M.A. degree in 1943. He then served in the Navy until 1946.
        He completed his Ph.D. in psychology at Yale University in 1949 and taught at the University of Wisconsin and Ohio State University before joining the Berkeley faculty in 1956.
        He traveled as a lecturer and consultant to universities throughout Europe, the Middle East, the Far East and Australia.
        Dr. Mussen is survived by his wife of 46 years, Ethel Foladore Mussen; a daughter, Michele, of Berkeley; a son, Jim, of New York; a brother, Irwin, of Berkeley; and a grandson.
