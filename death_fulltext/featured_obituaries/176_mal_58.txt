        Archibald R. Murray, a lawyer born in Barbados who was the first black president of the New York State Bar Association and the second black chairman of the executive committee of the City Bar Association as well as the longtime head of the Legal Aid Society, died on Sunday in New York. He was 68.
        The cause was a heart attack, his wife, Kay Crawford Murray, said.
        As attorney in chief and executive director of the Legal Aid Society from 1975 to 1994, Mr. Murray helped raise the standard of the free legal advice provided for poor and indigent defendants facing criminal charges in New York City.
        With a staff of about 1,000 lawyers at the time, the society offered legal services to approximately 75 percent of criminal defendants unable to pay for their own defense.
        Mr. Murray also increased the society's activity in civil law, persuading New York law firms to contribute money and lawyers' hours to its work in noncriminal cases, for which public financing is not available.
        Mr. Murray was a strong advocate of increasing minority representation in the Legal Aid Society and raised the percentage of minority lawyers on its staff to 19 percent from 3 percent.
        From 1994 until his retirement in 1998, he was chairman of the society and continued to represent it in public outreach and fund-raising activities.
        He was born in Barbados on Aug. 25, 1933. He came to the United States in 1950, studying first at Howard University and then at Fordham University School of Law, from which he graduated in 1960.
        That year he became an assistant district attorney in New York County; in 1962 he was made assistant counsel to Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York. From 1965 to 1967, he was in private practice in New York City, then became counsel to the New York State Crime Control Council until 1971, when was appointed administrator and then commissioner in the Division of Criminal Justice. He served until 1974.
        He was chairman of the executive committee of the City Bar Association from 1981 to 1982 and president of the New York State Bar Association from 1993 to 1994.
        He was active in the Episcopal Church, serving as chancellor of the Episcopal Diocese of New York from 1975 to 1987. He was a trustee of Fordham and Columbia Universities.
