        Clement M. Hakim, who helped develop the market for instant tea in the United States, died last Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 84.
        His Hakim Tea Corporation was a major importer of tea and a supplier to manufacturers of instant tea.
        When he returned to New York after service in World War II, he was quick to  see the potential for instant tea. He was a leading importer of Indonesian tea,  a good raw material for the instant product, and Nestle became his biggest customer for its Nestea line.
        In the 1960's, he helped Standard Brands develop a market for its black teas  from Brazil.
        Mr. Hakim, who was born in Alexandria, Egypt, began his apprenticeship in tea in 1931.
        The next year he settled in Shidzuka, Japan, the center of the green-tea trade, exporting tea to North Africa, the Middle East and the United States. He  moved to New York in 1940.
        During World War II, he served in the United States Army in India and Burma,  and on Gen. Douglas A. MacArthur's staff in Tokyo during the occupation.
        He is survived by a son, Maurice, of Bedford, N.Y.; a sister, Corinne Rossabi of New York City, and a granddaughter.
