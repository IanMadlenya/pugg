        Sir Bernard Waley-Cohen, a businessman who assisted the development of modern Israel and served a term as Lord Mayor of London, died on Wednesday. He was 77 years old.
        He died at his home in the Somerset village of Simonsbath. The family did not release the cause of death.
        Sir Bernard had a varied career in companies connected with investment banking, real estate development, investment and farming. He was a director of the Palestine Corporation, founded in 1922 by British businessmen to encourage the economic development in the British mandate of Palestine, much of which became Israel.
        In 1960 he was elected the 633d Lord Mayor of London by the aldermen of the City, London's financial district. His one-year term is remembered for the parties he gave at his official Mansion House residence.
        His father, Sir Robert Waley Cohen -- the name was not hyphenated until 1950 -- was an oil industry pioneer with the Shell company.
        Sir Bernard is survived by his wife, Joyce, two sons and two daughters. His funeral will be on Monday at Willesden Cemetery in London.
