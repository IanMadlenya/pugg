        Richard Rosenblum, a sculptor and a collector of Asian art, died on Tuesday at his home in Newton, Mass. He was 59.
        The cause was cancer, said Stanetsky Memorial Chapels in Brookline, Mass.
        Mr. Rosenblum was known for his collection of Chinese scholars' rocks, which has been called the finest in the world. An ancient art form, scholars' rocks are ornamental stones shaped by nature and human intervention into fantastic shapes, often marked with smooth fissures and perforations. From tiny sizes to several feet high, they have been used since the 10th century in China as accouterments of the scholar's study and are frequently the subject of paintings.
        The Rosenblum collection was seen in a popular exhibition organized in 1997 by the Asia Society in New York and the Harvard University Art Museums in Cambridge, Mass. It traveled to Seattle and to Europe.
        Scholars' rocks from Mr. Rosenblum's collection are promised gifts to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. More than 30 examples are now on display at the Met in ''The World of Scholars' Rocks: Garden Studios and Paintings.''
        Mr. Rosenblum was also a sculptor who trained at the Cleveland Institute of Art and the Cranbook Academy. He exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art, Boston, the Columbus Museum of Art, the DeCordova Museum in Lincoln, Mass., and the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York. In the 1990's he worked in the medium of computer montage.
        He is survived by his wife, Nancy,  and a daughter, Anna of Hinesburg, Vt.
