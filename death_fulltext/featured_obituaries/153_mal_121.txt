        Kenneth MacKenzie, an American dancer with Col. W. de Basil's Ballets Russes in the 1940's and a star of one of that troupe's most controversial productions, died on Sept. 23 at his  home in New Hope, Pa. He was 79.
        The cause was cancer, said his son,  Matthew.
        A native of Chicago, where he received his early training, Mr. MacKenzie was a member of the Ballets Russes from 1940 to 1947. An attractive and muscular dancer, he created a sensation in 1946 as Cain in David Lichine's ''Cain and Abel,'' with Oleg Tupine as Abel.
        The ballet raised eyebrows because the choreography required the men to wrestle in skimpy trunks and to dance erotically with flimsily clad women symbolizing Good and Evil.
        Another unusual role Mr. MacKenzie danced with the Ballets Russes in 1946 was the Sun God in Vania Psota's ''Yara,'' a retelling of Brazilian folklore with Surrealist scenery by the painter Candido Portinari.
        After the Ballets Russes, Mr. MacKenzie appeared in summer theaters and in a City Center revival of ''Carousel'' in 1949. Then, having injured his Achilles' tendon, he worked on a pipeline and in a General Motors factory in Ewing, N.J. He bought property in New Hope during the 50's and opened a coffeehouse there.
        Shortly after his wife, Mildred Ferguson, a former Ballet Theater dancer, died in 1981, he was reintroduced to Nina Stroganova, a Danish-born ballerina he had known from the Ballets Russes. They remained companions until her death in 1994.
        In addition to his son, of New Hope, he is survived by a daughter, Holly Hrynczyszyn of Buckingham, Pa.
