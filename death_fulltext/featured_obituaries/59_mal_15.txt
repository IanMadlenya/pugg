        Philip S. Pepe, an author of books about typewriting, died on Thursday at the Wesley-on-East retirement community in Rochester, where he had lived for four years. He was 80 years old and had previously lived in Blue Bell, Pa.
        He died of complications from Alzheimer's disease, his family said.
        One of Mr. Pepe's books went through various editions and was in print from McGraw Hill until early this year under the title, "Personal Typing in Twenty-Four Hours: Learn to Type on Your Electric or Manual Typewriter or Personal Computer."
        He was born in Waterbury, Conn. He married Margaret Elizabeth Tierney in 1943. She died in 1964.
        He is survived by a son, Philip Jr. of Yonkers; a daughter, Margaret Pepe-O'Brien of Rochester; and a brother, John, of Naples, Fla.
