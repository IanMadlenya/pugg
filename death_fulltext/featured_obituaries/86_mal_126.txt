        Hugo Castello, who coached New York University to 10 national championships in fencing, died yesterday of complications after surgery performed on Jan. 27. He was 79. The cause of death was cancer, said Mr. Castello's son-in-law, Kevin McMahon.
        Born in La Plata, Argentina, Mr. Castello arrived in the United States with his family in the mid-1920's. His father, Julio, was the N.Y.U. fencing coach from 1927 to 1947, during which time Hugo Castello won three National Intercollegiate Foil Fencing Championships (1935-37).
        After graduating from from Georgetown Law School in 1940, Mr. Castello joined the Navy. He succeeded his father as coach of the Violets in 1947 and was an assistant to the United States Fencing Team in the Olympic Games of 1960, 1964 and 1968 as well as a member of the United States Olympic Fencing Committee. He retired in 1981.
        Mr. Castello's first wife, Helen McLaughlin Caffery, died in 1978. He is survived by his second wife, Anna Russic Lucarini, of Manhattan; and a daughter, Eileen McMahon, and two grandchildren, all of Rye, N.Y.
