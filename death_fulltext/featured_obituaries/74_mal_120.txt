        Michael R. Miller, a theater historian and New York City health official, died on Saturday at the Roosevelt division of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. He was 46 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was AIDS, said his sister, Carol Lynn Hellman.
        Mr. Miller, a New York City native, attended Hunter College and St. John's University Law School. He worked successively for the city's Human Resources Administration, Department of Employment and, most recently, Health and Hospitals Corporation, where he was an assistant vice president at the time of his death.
        Although his career was in city government, Mr. Miller's passion was the architecture and lore of theaters. He was president of the Theater Historical Society of America from 1985 to 1989 and its regional director for the New York metropolitan area from 1973 to 1989. A Step Ahead of Wrecking Crews
        He documented hundreds of auditoriums in New York and other cities, paying meticulous attention to everything from the tiniest nickelodeons to the gaudiest movie palaces and grandest Broadway houses.
        With A. J. Buttler, another historian, he took 10,000 pictures of operating and abandoned theaters. Sometimes sneaking in hours ahead of the wrecking crews, the two would photograph by flashlight or whatever daylight filtered in through open exit doors. They braved rotting floors, hostile owners and once, in Brooklyn, gunfire.
        Mr. Miller also pored over building permits, blueprints and company records to pinpoint the evolution of each building.
        His collection is to be incorporated into the archives of the Theater Historical Society in the York Theater in Elmhurst, Ill., Mr. Buttler said.
        In addition to his sister, of Yorktown Heights, N.Y., Mr. Miller is survived by his companion, Archie Williams Jr.
