        Bernard Nath, a prominent lawyer and a leader in the Anti-Defamation League who worked to end discrimination, died last Wednesday at Highland Park Hospital in Chicago. He was 97.
        Mr. Nath, who worked to end discrimination against blacks as well as Jews, had worked with the Anti-Defamation League since the 1930's in many capacities, including serving on its National Commission and as chairman of its National Executive Committee. He was also the recipient of numerous awards and honors bestowed by the organization. His years with the Anti-Defamation League involved confrontations with segregationists during marches in the South and in ethnic neighborhoods in the North.
        ''Bernard Nath was a Lincolnesque figure who helped guide the A.D.L. for more than 60 years of enormous progress in the fight against anti-Semitism and bigotry in this country,'' said David H. Strassler, the organization's national chairman.
        Mr. Nath was born in Chicago on Feb. 23, 1899, and recently celebrated his 75th year in practice at the law firm of Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal. He joined the firm in 1921 after graduating from the University of Chicago.
        A prominent lawyer in the corporate and real estate community in Chicago, Mr. Nath left his imprint on the city's skyline. Projects in which he played a role included Prairie Shores, Sandburg Village and many major Loop office buildings.
        He is survived by his wife of 70 years, Ruth, and two daughters, Marjorie Ettlinger and Laurie Reinstein, both of Chicago.
