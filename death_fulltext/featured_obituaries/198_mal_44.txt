        Charles F. Myers Jr., a former chairman and chief executive of Burlington Industries, died on Sunday at Wellspring Retirement Center in Greensboro, N.C. He was 92.
        Mr. Myers began a 27-year career with Burlington, the textile manufacturer, in 1947 as head of its financial services department. He served as treasurer beginning in 1953 and was named executive vice president in 1961. The next year, he became the president and chief executive after the death of Burlington's founder, J. Spencer Love. In 1968, he was named chairman. He stepped down as chief executive in 1973 and he retired in 1974. He served on the board from 1955 to 1974.
        In addition to heading negotiations in the acquisition of several smaller textile companies in the Southeast, Mr. Myers's responsibilities included oversight of merchandising and manufacturing divisions and international operations.
        Burlington was the first textile company to reach $1 billion in sales, just as Mr. Myers became chief executive. Early in his tenure, the company invested more than $150 million in the modernization of its plants and machinery, and it and other textile companies increased their production of synthetic textiles. By 1970, more than 70 percent of textiles manufactured by Burlington was of man-made fibers or a blend. When he retired, the company's sales were $2 billion a year.
        Mr. Myers graduated from Davidson College in North Carolina in 1933 and received a master's degree in business from Harvard in 1935. He served in the Navy during World War II. Before joining Burlington, he worked for the Bank of New York and the Wachovia Bank and Trust Company.
        Mr. Myers is survived by four daughters, Brevard Henry of Columbus, N.C., Margaret Morris of Chapel Hill, N.C., Elizabeth Bonardi of Chevy Chase, Md., and Susan David of Charleston, S.C.; 13 grandchildren; and 3 great-grandchildren.
