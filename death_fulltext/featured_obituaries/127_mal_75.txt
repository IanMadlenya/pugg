        Dr. Christian, who wrote about religious philosophy, joined the Yale faculty in 1951 as an associate professor. He was promoted to full professor in 1962, was named to the John A. Hoober chair in 1971 and retired three years later.

Minear of Amherst, Mass.; a son, William A. Jr., of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain; his sister, Edith C. Powell of Austin, Tex., and five grandchildren.
