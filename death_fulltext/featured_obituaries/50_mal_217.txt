        Daniel Flanagan, a real-estate investor and restaurateur who founded the Blarney Stone bar and grill chain in New York, died on Friday at White Plains Hospital. He was 85 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Flanagan, who was born in Letterfrack, a village in County Galway, Ireland, came to the United States at the age of 18. In 1952 he started the Blarney Stone chain with a bar on Third Avenue at 44th Street.
        At its peak in the mid-60's, the chain had 23 restaurants. Mr. Flanagan would generally bring in a new partner in each bar and grill, share in the development, and then move on to another. At his death, he was directly involved in the ownership and management of three Blarney Stone restaurants.
        He developed many of his businesses along Third Avenue beneath elevated subway tracks that were later torn down. Real-estate developers purchased many of his restaurants to complete a block and build a high-rise. In return, Mr. Flanagan received not only cash but also stock in some of the real-estate companies.
        He employed many immigrants in his restaurants and was an active supporter of Irish-American organizations in New York.
        He is survived by a daughter, Dr. Ellen McGee, a professor of philosophy at C. W. Post College of Long Island University, and three grandchildren.
