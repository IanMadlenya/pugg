        Homer W. Giles, a lawyer and the chairman for two decades of the American Economic Foundation, which advocates limited interference of government in business, died on Sept. 30 at his home in University Heights, Ohio. He was 73.
        The cause was prostate cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Giles joined the foundation as a trustee in 1965 while he was a partner in the Cleveland law firm of Kuth & Giles. The foundation was started in 1939 by Fred Clark and Richard Stanton Remenazy because of their concerns about the programs of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
        In its heyday, the foundation, which is associated with the Heritage Foundation in Washington, used celebrities like John Wayne and Eddie Rickenbacker to spread its message of unhindered free enterprise.
        Mr. Giles was appointed chairman of the 11,000-member organization in 1973 after Mr. Clark died. For many years, he was also its only staff member, while working as a partner at the law firm of Walter Haverfield Buescher & Chockley, which he joined in 1968.
        A graduate of Adelbert College in Cleveland in 1940, Mr. Giles received his law degree from Western Reserve University School of Law, also in Cleveland.
        He is survived by his wife, Marcia Hurt; a daughter, Janice of Cleveland; four sons, Gregory of Slippery Rock, Pa., Jay of Burton, Ohio, Keith of Bethel, Me., and Tim of Frankfort, Ohio; a stepson, Timothy Pukys of Aurora, Ohio; a stepdaughter, Karen Pukys of Phoenix, and four grandchildren.
