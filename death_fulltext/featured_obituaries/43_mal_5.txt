        Mr. Conchon mixed a varied literary career with long-term Government service. From 1960 to 1980, he was secretary of debates at the Senate, the French Parliament's upper chamber.
        His first novel was published in 1953. His 1959 novel, ''La Corrida de la Victoire'' (''The Corrida of Victory'') won the Prix des Libraires, and a 1964 novel, ''L'Etat Sauvage'' (''The Savage State''), about a young French official in a newly independent African country, won the Prix Goncourt, France's most prestigious literary award. A film adaptation of ''L'Etat Sauvage'' was released in France in 1978 and had its New York premiere in January.
        Mr. Conchon also wrote scripts for several popular French films and was co-writer of the 1976 film ''Black and White in Color,'' with Jean-Jacques Annaud, its director. Winner of the Oscar for best foreign film, the movie was a satirical depiction of colonial life in French West Africa in 1915.
        Mr. Conchon was a journalist for the newspaper France-Soir in 1959-60 and served as artistic adviser to the national television channel Antenne 2 after his retirement from the Senate in 1980. He was a member of the governing Socialist Party.
