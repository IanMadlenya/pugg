        Ralph Stanton Emerson, a New York surgeon who helped develop physician-sponsored professional liability insurance during a malpractice insurance crisis in the 1970's, died on Sept. 26. He was 91.
        The cause was pulmonary arrest, said his son John W. Emerson.
        Dr. Emerson was president of the Medical Society of the State of New York from 1975 to 1976. At the time, rates for medical malpractice insurance were soaring in New York State, and most private insurance carriers discontinued their coverage. While president, Dr. Emerson helped create the Medical Liability Mutual Insurance Company, which eased the crisis by making malpractice policies available to New York doctors. Doctors paid the company directly for their coverage, avoiding the high overhead of commercial companies.
        Dr. Emerson, who was born in Foxcroft, Me., in 1912, was raised in East Orange, N.J. He graduated from Cornell in 1933, and from Cornell's medical college in 1936. After his surgical residency in New York City, he practiced surgery in Roslyn Heights, on Long Island, until he retired in 1981. Dr. Emerson then worked as a consultant for law firms and the Medical Liability Mutual Insurance Company.
        In addition to his son John, his survivors include his daughter, Joan Bruno, and another son, Scott.
