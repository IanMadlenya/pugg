        Hy Gotkin, a 5-foot-8 guard who helped the St. John's University basketball team win National Invitation Tournament titles in 1943 and 1944, died Sunday night at a hospice in Boca Raton, Fla. He was 81.
        The cause was heart and kidney failure, and he had Alzheimer's disease, his son Stuart said.
        In 1943, Gotkin and the 6-9 Harry Boykoff, his former classmate at Thomas Jefferson High School in Brooklyn, led St. John's into the N.I.T. at Madison Square Garden. St. John's beat Toledo in the final, 48-27. The next year, St. John's upset George Mikan and DePaul, 49-39, in the final and remains the only team to win successive N.I.T. titles. In 1945, St. John's lost to Bowling Green, 57-44, in the tournament semifinals. Gotkin explained his team's success by saying, ''We knew how to play the game.''
        After college, Gotkin played four years in the professional Eastern League. His attempt to make the Knicks in 1946, their first season, was foiled by a training-camp injury.
        He later worked in his family's infant-clothing business and recruited players for St. John's. After earning a master's degree in education from St. John's in 1960, he taught at Brooklyn high schools for 25 years. He retired in 1985 and moved to Delray Beach, Fla.
        Hyman Gotkin was born Aug. 16, 1922, in Brooklyn. His wife of 57 years, the former Dolores Miller, died last August.
        He is survived by two sons, Stuart of Delray Beach and Mark of Valley Stream, N.Y.; a grandson; two brothers, Leonard of Delray Beach and Harry of Merrick, N.Y.; and a sister, Alice Simberg of Nanuet, N.Y.
        Gotkin was elected to the New York City Basketball Hall of Fame and the St. John's Athletic Hall of Fame.
