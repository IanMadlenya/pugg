        Alan J. Gould, who retired as executive editor of The Associated Press in 1963 after 41 years with the news service, died yesterday at Indian River Memorial Hospital in Vero Beach, Fla., where he was living in retirement. A Florida resident since 1975, he was 95.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        With Mr. Gould as its chief editor, the A.P. won 14 Pulitzer Prizes for reporting and photography. He left his imprint on the news agency, the country's largest, by expanding interpretive and in-depth writing and issuing strict orders for clear language in the news copy.
        Born in Philadelphia, he moved to Elmira, N.Y., with his family as a boy. He got his first newspaper job, on The Elmira Star-Gazette, in 1914 at the age of 16 when the city editor hired him as a part-time reporter for $5 a week.
        After finishing high school and briefly studying at Cornell University, Mr. Gould went back to work for papers in Elmira, Ithaca and Binghamton.
        Hired by the A.P. in New York, he quickly rose to sports editor, expanded both the staff and coverage and instituted features like the football poll, in which sports writers rank the top college teams nationwide.
        In 1938 he organized the agency's first personnel department, and in 1941 he became executive editor, having responsibility for the A.P.'s entire news report. He directed World War II coverage and after the war oversaw the fledgling A.P. World Report, which sends news and photos around the globe. He also initiated specialized writing on subjects like science and religion.
        Mr. Gould is survived by his wife, Catherine; a son, Alan Jr., of Jekyll Island, Ga.; a daughter, Mary Ann Houseman of Panorama City, Calif.; a sister, Rosalie Rose of Penn Yan, N.Y., and four grandchildren. His first wife, Mary Denton Gould, died in 1966; his second wife, Mildred Sliter Gould, died in 1976.
