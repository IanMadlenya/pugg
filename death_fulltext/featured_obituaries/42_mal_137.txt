        John Volkmann, professor emeritus of psychology at Mount Holyoke College, who specialized in the psychology of judgment, died last Thursday at his home in Northampton, Mass. He was 84 years old.
        The college said he died of heart failure.
        Professor Volkmann, who retired in 1971 after 25 years on the Mount Holyoke faculty, conducted extensive research until two months ago in the areas of space perception and visual acuity. He held several patents for devices that resulted from his studies of judgment and sensory discrimination.
        Born in Sleepy Eye, Minn., Professor Volkmann received bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees from Harvard University. He taught there before becoming an instructor of psychology at Columbia University in 1937. In 1946 he joined the Mount Holyoke faculty as an associate professor, and from 1958 until his retirement, he was director of the college's Psychophysical Research Unit.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Frances Cooper, a professor of psychology at Smith College; a daughter, Diana Pratt of Ann Arbor, Mich.; two sons, Stephen and Thomas, both of Northampton, and a grandson.
