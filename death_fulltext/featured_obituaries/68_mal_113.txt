        Dr. Leon Jacobson, who was the chief doctor for the research team that created the atomic bomb, died on Sunday at the University of Chicago's Bernard Mitchell Hospital. He was 81 years old.
        He died of complications from lung cancer, said John Easton, a spokesman for the university.
        As a young resident at the University of Chicago hospital in 1942, Dr. Jacobson was summoned from a patient's bedside and told he was being put in charge of protecting the health of the staff of the secret Manhattan Project at the university to build the first nuclear reactor and to create plutonium.
        He was chosen because he had done research on the biological effects of radiation, and was one of the first doctors to treat blood disorders with radioactive phosphorus. By the conclusion of the project in 1945 Dr. Jacobson and his staff had produced several medical advances, including testing the first forms of chemotherapy to fight cancer.
        Professor Jacobson, a native of Sims, N.D., received a bachelor of science degree from North Dakota State University in 1935 and his medical degree from the University of Chicago in 1939.
        He was an authority on the study and clinicial use of radiation in medicine and on diseases of the blood.
        His professional career, spent entirely at the University of Chicago, included serving as director of the Argonne Cancer Research Hospital and as dean of the medical school's division of biological sciences.
        His first wife, Elizabeth L. Benton, died in 1983. Dr. Jacobson, who lived in Chicago, is survived by his second wife, Elise; a son, Eric P. Jacobson, of Jackson, Mich.; a daughter, Judith A. Boniker of Indianapolis, and six grandchildren.
