        Maurice M. Bayon, the co-founder and former chairman of Petroleum Helicopters Inc., an operator of commercial helicopters, died on March 22 at his home in New Orleans. He was 92.
        A native Louisianian, he graduated from Tulane University Law School and commanded a ground unit providing support to elements of the Army Air Forces in World War II. He won the Bronze Star.
        In 1946, he co-founded Offshore Navigation Inc., a radio navigation business supporting oil exploration in the Gulf of Mexico.
        In 1949, he and Robert L. Suggs contracted to provide helicopter services to Shell Oil and then founded Petroleum Helicopters Inc., in the same year.
        The company began with three helicopters, grew quickly and operated more than 400 helicopters for a time, but encountered some difficulties in the 1980's. Mr. Bayon retired from both companies in 1990.
        He is survived by his wife, Frances; a daughter, Suzanne deNeufville, and three grandsons.
