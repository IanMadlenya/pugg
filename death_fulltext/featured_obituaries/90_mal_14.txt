        George Nyandoro, an early African nationalist in what is now independent Zimbabwe, died on June 24 in Harare, the capital. He was 67 and lived in Harare.
        He died after collapsing at his home, The Associated Press reported.
        Mr. Nyandoro was one of the founders of the prolonged, and ultimately successful, campaign against white supremacy and for majority rule in the self-governing British colony of Southern Rhodesia. Its name was changed to Rhodesia and then, when it became independent in 1980, to Zimbabwe.
        He was born on an African reservation into a powerful clan. He began working as a newspaper vendor, studied bookkeeping and became a prominent trade unionist. He played a key role in a short general strike by black workers in 1948. He also became the secretary general of the British African National Voice Association, an early mass protest movement. And he was a founding officer of the African National Youth League, which confronted the white rulers of that day by provoking a bus boycott.
        As African nationalism surged in Mr. Nyandoro's homeland, a state of emergency was declared. He was detained for four years without trial and was freed after he was found to have tuberculosis of the spine. He eventually left the nationalist mainstream, spent some years in Zambia and went on to serve as a a Rhodesian Cabinet minister in 1979, just before independence.
        Afterward, he became a leading businessman.
        His is survived by his second wife, Sarudzai, and seven children.
