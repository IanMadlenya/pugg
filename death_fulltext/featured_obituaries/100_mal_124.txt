        Sheppard Beidler, a founder and former president of Grow Group Inc., a producer of specialty chemicals and paints, died on Tuesday in Kingston (N.Y.) Hospital. He was 76 and lived in Great Neck, L.I.
        The cause was prostate cancer, a spokesman for Grow Group said.
        Mr. Beidler was president of Grow Group from 1950 to 1962, during which it expanded through acquisitions of paint and chemical companies. Grow Group is based in New York and has 17 plants in the United States, making such brands of paint as Devoe and Sinclair. He remained a director until 1993.
        From 1976 to his death, he also served as a director of the Metro-Tel Corporation, a manufacturer of telephone testing equipment, and was its chairman for some years.
        Mr. Beidler graduated from City College with a degree in electrical engineering. After serving in World War II, he founded the Metropolitan Telecommunications Corporation in the 1950's. In 1963, it was sold and became known as Metro-Tel.
        He is survived by his wife, Norma, of Accord, N.Y.; two daughters, Patricia Appel of Manhattan and Barbara Brewster of Woodstock, N.Y.; a son, David, of New York City, and two grandchildren.
