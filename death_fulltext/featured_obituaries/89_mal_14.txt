        Robert Hatch, a critic for and editor of The Nation for almost 25 years, died on Tuesday at his home in Riverdale in the Bronx. He was 83.
        The cause was bone marrow disease, said his wife, Ruth Hatch.
        In 1954, Mr. Hatch joined the staff of The Nation as a film critic, becoming managing editor in 1964 and executive editor in 1967. He retired in 1978, although he continued to write film reviews for the magazine.
        Mr. Hatch graduated from Princeton University in 1933, and worked in London during World War II for the Office of War Information. He wrote drama and film criticism for Horizon and Theater Arts magazines and was a culture editor of The New Republic.
        Mr. Hatch is survived by his wife of 55 years; a daughter, Gillian Gretton of London; a son, Peter of Toronto, and three grandchildren.
