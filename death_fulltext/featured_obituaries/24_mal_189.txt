        Dr. John Douglas French, a neurosurgeon who helped found and for 20 years directed the U.C.L.A. Brain Research Institute, died of Alzheimer's disease Wednesday. He was 77 years old.
        Over four decades Dr. French researched the brain mechanisms related to epilepsy, comas, anesthesia, sleep and wakefulness.
        He died at the John Douglas French Center for Alzheimer's Disease, which opened in 1987 as the nation's first facility designed and built exclusively for patients with the disease.
        He is survived by his wife, the soprano Dorothy Kirsten French, whom he married in 1955. In 1983 she created the French Foundation for Alzheimer Research, which has raised more than $2 million.
