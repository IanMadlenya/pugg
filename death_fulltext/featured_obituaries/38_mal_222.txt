        Morton R. Tolleris, a retired Criminal Court judge, died of a heart attack on Tuesday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. He was 81 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Judge Tolleris, a graduate of Cornell University Law School, was in private practice and had served as a law assistant to State Supreme Court justices before being appointed to the Magistrate's Court by Mayor Robert F. Wagner in 1957.
        He was reappointed as a judge by Mayor John V. Lindsay to the Criminal Court in 1967, but was not reappointed in 1978 by Mayor Edward I. Koch. He remained active in the courts, however, most recently as a hearing officer in the Criminal Court in Manhattan, a position he held at his death. He was a member of the board of governors of the New York Cardiac Center.
        He is survived by a daughter, Jill Meltzer of Cherry Hill, N.J.; a sister, Ruth Pfeffer, and a brother, Ralph, both of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
