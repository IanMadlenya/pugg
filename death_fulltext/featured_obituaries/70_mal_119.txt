        David Oliver, who played the role of Sam Gardner in the television drama "A Year in the Life," died last Thursday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 30 years old.
        Mr. Oliver's career also included performances on the stage.
        "A Year in the Life," which had its premiere on NBC in 1986, traced the lives of a fictitious Seattle family for a year. He played a 23-year-old business-school student who was about to settle into a safe marriage when his life was suddenly disrupted by another woman.  Mr. Oliver also appeared for two years in the NBC soap opera "Another World" and in the television movie "Miracle in the Wilderness."
        His stage performances included many roles with the San Diego Civic Light Opera, including parts in "L'il Abner" and "The Unsinkable Molly Brown." He also performed regularly at the Edinburgh Theater Festival, and was seen recently in "Elegies," a play about AIDS, at the Canon Theater in Beverly Hills.
        He is survived by his companion, Terry Houlihan; his mother and stepfather, Pat and Gordon Hingle; his father, William Oliver, and seven brothers and sisters.
