        A native of Vienna, he came to the United States in the mid-1930's after working with such European musical figures as Bruno Walter and Karl Boehm.
        He joined the faculty of the Mannes School of Music in New York and received conducting assignments from among other musical organizations, the New York City Opera and the New York Philharmonic. He also pursued a recording career, conducting radio and opera orchestras in Cologne, Hamburg and Stuttgart in West Germany.
        He is survived by his wife, Lotte. A memorial service is planned in the fall.
