        Elizabeth (Biddie) Kramer, a philanthropist who spent most of her life raising millions of dollars for the nation of Israel, died on Monday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 86.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, her family said.
        In 1949, Mrs. Kramer and her husband, Benjamin Abrams, the founder and chairman of the Emerson Radio Corporation, visited Israel. At a meeting with Prime Minister David Ben Gurion and Finance Minister Eliezer Kaplan , Mr. Abrams suggested issuing bonds to help finance the new nation.
        As a result of that conversation, the Israel Bond Campaign was born.  From its inception and for years after Mr. Abrams's death in 1967, Mrs. Kramer remained deeply involved in the campaign, serving at various times as a co-chairwoman, honoree and fund-raiser. Mark Ruben, executive director for Israel Bonds of the Greater Palm Beaches, credited her with raising tens of millions of dollars for Israel.
        Mrs. Kramer was also involved in various educational projects, serving as a member of the board of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and as vice president of the American Friends of the Hebrew University, which bestowed on her the Scopus Award and an honorary doctorate of philosophy in 1984.
        She was also the first recipient of the Israel Bond Association's Eleanor Roosevelt Centennial Award for her philanthropic efforts.
        A member of Long Island University's board, Mrs. Kramer was a founder of the Benjamin and Elizabeth Abrams Communication Center at the university. She also served on the board of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel and as chairwoman of the Women's Division of the United Jewish Appeal in New York City and Palm Beach.
        Mrs. Kramer, who survived two other husbands, leaves three daughters, Marjorie Hyman, Geraldine Kory and Cynthia Bernstein, all of New York City; six grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.
