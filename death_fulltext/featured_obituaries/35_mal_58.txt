        C. L. Dellums, a labor and civil rights leader, died yesterday of cardiac arrest in Oakland, Calif., where he lived for the last 66 years. He was 89 years old.
        In the 1920's, Mr. Dellums worked with A. Philip Randolph to organize the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the first international union to be founded and led by blacks. Mr. Dellums was elected vice president of the union in 1929 and became president in 1966.
        When the porters union joined the American Federation of Labor in 1919, it worked to remove all color clauses from the federation's constitution.
        In 1959, Mr. Dellums was appointed to California's first Fair Employment Practice Commission, on which he served for 26 years. It was later named the Fair Employment and Housing Commission.
        Born in Corsicana, Tex, in 1900, Mr. Dellums was the first regional chairperson for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People when 18 states formed an NAACP region in 1948.
        Mr. Dellums, the uncle of Representative Ronald V. Dellums from California's Eight Congressional District, is also survived by a daughter, Marva Dellums, of Oakland, and several grandchildren.
        Correction:  December 9, 1989, Saturday, Late Edition - Final
        A headline in some copies yesterday on the obituary of a labor and civil rights leader misidentified him.
        He was C. L. Dellums. A corrected obituary appears today on page 31.
