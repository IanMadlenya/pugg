        Sylvan Furman, a former state official and an expert on community mental health issues, died at his home in Manhattan on Tuesday. He was 80 years old.
        Mr. Furman died of cancer, said Rebecca Meiskin, a granddaughter.
        In 1958 Mr. Furman was appointed to head the Manhattan Society for Mental Health, a private group involved in public-policy mental health issues. In 1966 he was appointed Associate Commissioner of the New York State Department of Mental Hygiene, a post he held until his retirement in 1976.
        Mr. Furman is survived by his wife, Eleanor; four children, Emily, of Brighton, England, Hester, of Manhattan, Laura, of Lockhart, Tex., and Ellen Sklar, of Burlington, Vt., and four grandchildren.
