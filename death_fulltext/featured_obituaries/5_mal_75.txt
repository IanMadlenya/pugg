        Mr. Michalovic, who was born in Riga, Latvia, immigrated with his family to Argentina when he was a child. It was in Buenos Aires that he began his long association with Yiddish theater, appearing in productions in Argentina, Brazil, France and, more often than not in recent decades, New York. He was recognized as a character actor and had roles in musical productions starring Mary Soreanu at Town Hall and also in the prestigious Folksbiene Theater. Last season, Mr. Michalovic appeared in a production here of the National Yiddish Theater, of which he was an executive board member.
        He was also a vice president of the Hebrew Actors Union, a board member of the Congress for Jewish Culture and the Yiddish Theatrical Alliance and treasurer of the United Hebrew Trades.
        Mr. Michalovic is survived by his second wife, Shifra Lerer, a Yiddish actress, and a son, Moshe, of Israel.
