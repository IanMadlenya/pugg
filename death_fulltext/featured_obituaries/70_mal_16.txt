        David Hershel Rosenthal, a writer, poet and translator of Catalan literature, died on Friday at his home in Suffern, N.Y. He was 46 years old.
        He died of pancreatic cancer, said his father, the poet M. L. Rosenthal.
        David Rosenthal's 1983 translation of the 15th-century Catalan novel "Tirant lo Blanc" was the first English publication of that work. He also translated the works of several modern Catalan writers, including Merce Rodoreda's novel "The Time of the Doves" and a collection of poems by J. V. Foix.
        Reflecting his enthusiasm for jazz, Mr. Rosenthal's last published book was "Hard Bop: Jazz and Black Music, 1955-65" (1992). He was also the author of several volumes of poetry, including "Loves of the Poets" and "The Journey," a collection dealing with his illness. His recently completed book about Barcelona, "Flags in the Wind," is to be released in that city early next year.
        Mr. Rosenthal, who earned a doctorate in comparative literature from the City University of New York, taught at New York University, Fordham University, Baruch College and other New York and Spanish colleges.
        In addition to his father, he is survived by his mother, Victoria; a brother, Alan, of Manhattan, and a sister, Laura McGarry of Pelham Manor, N.Y.
