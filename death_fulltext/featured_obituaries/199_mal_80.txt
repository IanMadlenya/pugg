        Robert Jackson, a muralist and master of trompe l'oeil artistry, died on Aug. 17 at his home in Livingston, N.Y. He was 72.
        He had been suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease, said Frederick Corke, his companion.
        Mr. Jackson's work appears in the American Wing period rooms of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where he created some of the ornament in the Gothic Revival Library and in the Renaissance Revival Parlor, where he painted the ceiling.
        ''His most intricate project was for the ceiling of the 1870 Renaissance Revival Parlor, where he recreated the original ceiling from historic photographs,'' said Amelia Peck, associate curator of American decorative arts at the Metropolitan.
        His trompe l'oeil specialty, in which texture and shading produce the illusion of depth, led him to work on many historic houses. He told an interviewer for The Times Union of Albany in 1994 that he had learned much when as a young man he participated in the restoration of Horace Walpole's home, Strawberry Hill, in Twickenham, England. His work also appears in famous public spaces in the United States, including Blair House and the diplomatic reception room at the State Department.
        Mr. Jackson was born in Toronto and received a degree in archaeology and fine arts from the University of Toronto. He began his career in London, where he lived for 10 years before moving to New York City in 1965.
        In addition to his companion, Mr. Corke of Livingston, he is survived by a sister, Eleanor Warnock of Newmarket, Ontario.
