        John Wadsworth Barnes, who directed, produced or wrote more than 100 educational films, died on June 27 at the New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 80 and lived in Brooklyn.
        In 1953 Mr. Barnes received an Academy Award nomination for ''The Living City,'' his documentary about urban problems. From 1959 through 1971 he made a series of films about classical Western civilization and Shakespearean themes, including the three-part ''Shaw vs. Shakespeare'' with Donald Moffat as Shaw.
        Mr. Barnes's films regularly drew upon the expertise of scholars like Clifton Fadiman and Mortimer Adler and featured actors like Richard Kiley, Judi Dench, Douglas Campbell and Frances Sternhagen.
        He also made a series of 14 films with Marcel Marceau and collaborated with the poet Archibald MacLeish and the composer Ezra Laderman on two films, ''Magic Prison: The Poetry of Emily Dickinson'' and ''Keats: His Life and Death.''
        Born in Belford, N.J., on March 25, 1920, Mr. Barnes attended the University of Chicago. He began experimenting with filmmaking in the 1940's.
        His first film, about interracial refugee camps, was titled ''To Live Together'' and was produced with money from the Chicago Anti-Defamation League. In 1951, Mr. Barnes wrote, filmed and was a producer of the groundbreaking ''People Along the Mississippi'' for Encyclopaedia Britannica.
        Directed by George Weisenborn, the film portrayed the interaction of two boys, one white, the other African-American, as they tried to deal with racial prejudice. His last film was a 1977 adaptation of Walter Van Tilburg Clark's ''The Portable Phonograph.''
        Mr. Barnes is survived by his wife, Jeanne; a daughter, Judith, of Brooklyn; two sons, Ezra, of Brooklyn, and Joshua, of Honolulu; and two grandchildren.
