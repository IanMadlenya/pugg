He was 81 years old and lived in Bayside, Queens. He died of a cerebral hemorrhage, his son Paul said. Mr. Fleisig was a member of the Philharmonic from 1938 to 1943 and was its union chairman when the Philharmonic's board announced that it would not renew the contracts of 14 musicians, including Mr. Fleisig. He filed charges against the orchestra's incoming conductor, Artur Rodzinski, and threatened to delay contract negotiations and postpone the 1944 season. The charges were dropped after the American Federation of Musicians upheld the Philharmonic's decision.
        After his dismissal Mr. Fleisig played with various pop and symphonic orchestras, including the ABC Television Orchestra.
        In addition to his son, Paul, of Woodhaven, Queens, he is survived by his wife, the former Jane Messeder; a sister, Irene Siskind of Santa Rosa, Calif.; three sons, David, of Berkeley, Calif., Leonard, of Jersey City, and Alan, of Manhattan; a daughter, Laurel Rund, of East Brunswick, N.J., and five grandchildren.
