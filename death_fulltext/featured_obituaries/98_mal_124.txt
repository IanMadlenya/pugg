        The rap artist Eazy-E, a founder of the influential "gansta" rap group N.W.A., died yesterday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles after being hospitalized in late February with AIDS. He was 31.
        He died at 6:35 P.M. of AIDS-related pneumonia, said a spokeswoman for the hospital.
        The rapper, whose real name was Eric Wright, was admitted to the hospital for treatment for asthma. His record company later announced that he had full-blown AIDS and that he had been unaware he had the disease.
        In a statement read by his attorney at the time, the rap performer said: "I've learned in the last week that this thing is real and it doesn't discriminate. It affects everyone."
        The hospital got so many phone calls from distraught fans -- about 2,500 a day -- that they had to hire more operators.
