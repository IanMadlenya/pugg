        Edwin Emery, a journalism professor at the University of Minnesota and the author of books on the news media, died yesterday at Midwest Community Hospice in Minneapolis. He was 79 and lived in Minneapolis.
        The cause was leukemia, the hospice said.
        Mr. Emery taught at the university's School of Journalism and Mass Communication for 39 years. He wrote 11 books on journalism and was best known for "Press and America" (Prentice Hall), which was regarded as a leading history of journalism.
        He received a Sigma Delta Chi award for his "History of the American Newspaper Publishers Association" (University of Minnesota Press, 1950) and he edited, along with his son, Michael, "Highlights in the History of the American Press" (University of Minnesota Press, 1954).
        In 1960, he and Warren K. Agee and Philip H. Ault wrote "Introduction to Mass Communications" (Dodd, Mead), which is scheduled for an 11th edition next month. For nine years, he was the editor of the Journalism Quarterly.
        He was also a consultant to the publishers association, the United States Information Agency, and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary McNevin Emery; his son, Michael, of Woodland Hills, Calif.; two daughters, Laurel Emery of Tustin, Calif., and Alison Emery of Minneapolis, and three grandchildren.
