        Michael Merritt, an award-winning set designer for movies and plays, died on Aug. 3 at his home in Chicago. He was 47 years old.
        He died of colon and liver cancer, said Michael Maggio, the associate artistic director of the Goodman Theater in Chicago.
        Mr. Merritt was closely associated throughout his career with Chicago-area theaters. He designed the sets for all of David Mamet's plays, including "An American Buffalo" and "Speed-the-Plow," and for several films of the playwright's work, including "Things Change" (1988) and "Homicide" (1991).
        His designs won eight Joseph Jefferson Awards, Chicago's equivalent of a Tony. His set design for the drama "My Thing of Love" is currently at the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago. He also designed the set for the 1991 television film "Brewster Place."
        He is survived by his parents, Harold and Ruby Merritt of Galena, Ill.; a brother, Dean, of Aurora, Ill., and a sister, Tamara Nesheim of St. Paul.
