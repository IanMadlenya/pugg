        Leon Lewis, a veteran radio talk-show host in New York City, died on Sunday at St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 81 and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Lewis was the nighttime voice of WMCA from 1970 to 1980. On ''The Leon Lewis Talk Show,'' he took calls from listeners, debated public issues, offered advice to the troubled or merely provided a sympathetic ear, greeting each caller with a soothing ''Hello, my friend.''
        Before he joined WMCA, Mr. Lewis was the moderator of ''Community Opinion,'' a call-in show on WLIB in Harlem. In 1967, the station won a George Foster Peabody award for the show, which was credited with helping to defuse racial tension.
        Mr. Lewis, who was born in Bloomington, Ind., began his radio career at WABY in Albany. After working as a disk jockey and in advertising sales, he moved to New York City in 1954 and became circulation manager for The Amsterdam News. He left the paper in 1957 and joined radio station WWRL as news director before moving to WLIB.
        He is survived by his wife, Cassandra Lewis of Manhattan, from whom he was estranged; a sister, Beatrice Jones of Schenectady, N.Y., and his companion, Maida Feingold of Manhattan.
