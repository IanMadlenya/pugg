        Horance Gibbs Davis Jr., a Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial writer who became an influential journalism educator at the University of Florida, died here on Monday. He was 80.
        The cause was heart failure, said his daughter, Jennifer Nicole of Gainesville.
        Mr. Davis, who was known as Buddy, served on the Florida journalism faculty for 31 years before retiring in 1985. For almost that long he was a columnist and editorial writer for The Gainesville Sun and other publications. He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1971 for a series of Sun editorials on race issues.
        Mr. Davis was born in Manchester, Ga., and served in the Army Air Corps in the Pacific during World War II. After the war, he earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Florida. He joined the university's fledgling journalism school in 1954.
        He wrote editorials for The Sun from 1962 to 1983 and then was a columnist for the New York Times Regional Newspaper Group until 1989.
        In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his wife, Marjorie; a son, Gregory, of Augusta, Ga.; a granddaughter; and a half-sister, Mae Jones of Clarksville, Va.
