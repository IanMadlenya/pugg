        Joseph S. Bruno, who built a tiny downtown grocery store into a large grocery and pharmacy chain that included the Piggly Wiggly and Food Fair supermarkets, died on Sunday. He was 83 and lived in Birmingham.
        Mr. Bruno and his brother Sam opened their first grocery store in 1932 with an investment of $600. The business eventually expanded into a chain of 254 supermarkets along the East Coast, employing more than 27,000 people.
        The chain, which operated stores under such names as Bruno's, Food Max and Food World, was sold last year in a $1.15 billion buyout. The buyer was Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, a New York investment concern with holdings in other supermarket companies.
        The Bruno family retained Big B Inc., a discount drug store chain whose headquarters are in Birmingham.
        Mr. Bruno is survived by his wife, Theresa, two daughters, Theresa Sprain and Anne LaRussa, all of Birmingham, 10 grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren.
