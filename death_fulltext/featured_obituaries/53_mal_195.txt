        The Rev. Julian Francis Deeken, a Franciscan priest and former chaplain to the New York City Fire Department, died on Sunday at St. Mary's Hospital in Palm Beach, Fla. He was 62 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of cancer, a spokesman for the Franciscans said.
        Father Deeken, a graduate of St. Bonaventure College, studied theology at Holy Name College in Washington and later earned a degree in sacred music from the Pius X School of Liturgical Music at Manhattanville College.
        He was ordained in 1954 and taught music at St. Francis College and at Christ the King Seminary before being assigned to St. Francis of Assisi Church in Manhattan in 1967. He was appointed chaplain of the Fire Department in 1982.
        He is survived by a sister, Dolores Mahlbacher of Palm Springs, Fla.
