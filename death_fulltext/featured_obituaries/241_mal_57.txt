        Elliott Baker, a screenwriter and novelist whose first book, ''A Fine Madness,'' was made into a Hollywood film starring Sean Connery, died on Feb. 9 in Los Angeles. He was 84 and had lived in Los Angeles for many years.
        The cause was cancer, his niece Lee Moskof said.
        A dark, raucous picaresque tale, ''A Fine Madness'' (Putnam, 1964) chronicled the misadventures of Samson Shillitoe, a middle-aged poet forced to earn his living shampooing carpets. Reviewing the novel in The New York Times Book Review, Richard P. Brickner described it as ''a masterpiece of what one might call rebellious farce.''
        Mr. Baker also wrote the film version of ''A Fine Madness,'' released in 1966. Besides Mr. Connery, who played Samson Shillitoe, its stars included Joanne Woodward, Jean Seberg, Patrick O'Neal and Colleen Dewhurst.
        Elliot Joseph Cohen was born in Buffalo on Dec. 15, 1922; he changed his name when he began his writing career. He earned a bachelor's degree in business from Indiana University in 1948 and then began writing for television, working on ''Robert Montgomery Presents,'' ''The Kaiser Aluminum Hour'' and other shows.
        Mr. Baker adapted Murray Schisgal's play ''Luv'' for Hollywood in 1967 and John Osborne's play ''The Entertainer'' for television in 1976.
        Among his other novels are ''Pocock & Pitt'' (Putnam, 1971); ''Klynt's Law'' (Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, 1976); ''And We Were Young'' (Times Books, 1979); and ''Unhealthful Air'' (Viking, 1988). His novel ''The Penny Wars'' (Putnam, 1968) was adapted for the Broadway stage, playing five performances in 1969.
        Mr. Baker is survived by his wife, Helen.
