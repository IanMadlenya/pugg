        Horst Schulmann, who played a role in developing the European currency unit and served on the powerful policy-making council of the German central bank, died on Thursday in a hospital in Frankfurt, his office said today. He was 61.
        He had been undergoing treatment for lung cancer for the past year.
        A monetary expert, Mr. Schulmann was deputy managing director and later managing director of the Institute of International Finance in Washington from 1984 until 1992, when he returned to Germany to become president of the regional central bank in Frankfurt.
        As one of the nine regional central bank presidents, Mr. Schulmann was also a member of the governing council of the central bank, or Bundesbank. Until recently he took part in the biweekly sessions that have been steadily reducing German interest rates since late 1992.
        Mr. Schulmann served as a deputy director at the World Bank in Washington from 1970 to 1975 and later on the staff of the executive commission of the European Community, now the European Union, in Brussels.
        After 1977, he moved to Bonn to advise Chancellor Helmut Schmidt on economic, financial and social policy.
        He is survived by his wife, Ulrike, and two children, Daniel and Anja, both university students.
