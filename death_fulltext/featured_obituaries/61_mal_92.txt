        Charles Nagel, a former director of the Brooklyn Museum and other art institutions, died last Thursday at a hospital in Wareham, Mass. He was 93 years old and had lived for the last seven years in Marion, Mass.
        He died of pneumonia, said his wife, the former Lucie Lull Oliver.
        An architect who turned to museum work, Mr. Nagel was director of the Brooklyn Museum from 1946 to 1955, where he was cited for his contributions to art education and industrial design. From 1955 until his retirement in 1964, he was director of the St. Louis Art Museum.
        After his retirement, he became the first director of the National Portrait Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution. He stayed in the post until 1969, overseeing renovation of the Old Patent Office Building in downtown Washington, which now houses the museum, and its opening in 1968.
        At the portrait gallery, Mr. Nagel became embroiled in a dispute over his purchase and intention to hang a portrait of President Lyndon B. Johnson, painted in 1966 by Peter Hurd. The President had pronounced the portrait "the ugliest thing I ever saw." Mr. Nagel bought the painting knowing it was unacceptable to Mr. Johnson. He cited it as "a good likeness" and "a serious picture." But he was overruled by Ladybird Johnson and Dillon Ripley, then the head of the Smithsonian, and a bronze bust of the President was substituted.
        Mr. Nagel, who was born in St. Louis, was the son of Charles Nagel, Secretary of Commerce and Labor in the Cabinet of President William Howard Taft. The younger Nagel graduated in 1923 from Yale, which awarded him a B.F.A. in 1926. He also studied at the American School in Fontainebleau, France, and in 1956 received a Ph.D. in fine arts from MacMurray College in Jacksonville, Ill.
        Mr. Nagel practiced architecture in Boston and St. Louis from 1927 to 1942, taking time out, from 1930 to 1936, to serve as curator of decorative arts at the Yale Art Gallery. He was the author of "American Furniture, 1650-1850," published in 1949, and "Seven Letters to Counsel," a short novel, published in 1965. In 1936, he collaborated on "American Rooms," with Russell Kettell.
        He is survived by his wife.
