        Russell W. McFall, who led Western Union's transition from an outmoded telegram delivery service to a modern telecommunications giant, died on Saturday at his home in Ormond Beach, Fla. He was 72.
        Mr. McFall became the chief executive of Western Union in 1965. He took the company out of the telegram business almost completely and moved it into mailgrams and satellites. He was by training and disposition more a technician than a marketer, and in the 14 years of his leadership Western Union saw many important technical advances.
        "We're changing from a telegraph company into an information company, a computer-based information utility," Mr. McFall said in 1969.
        When he announced his retirement in 1979, at 57, it coincided with the company's potential loss of its Government-sponsored monopoly on telegrams, an advantage that Western Union said it was more than willing to give up so it could concentrate on less-regulated businesses.
        After graduating from the University of Maryland in 1943 as an electrical engineer, Mr. McFall joined the General Electric Company, eventually heading its ballistic missile program. He was later a vice president at Litton Industries before joining Western Union in 1963 as executive vice president.
        Mr. McFall is survived by a son, Russell, of Daytona Beach, Fla.; a daughter, Susan McFall Wootton of Ormond Beach, and a brother, Donald, of Bethesda, Md.
