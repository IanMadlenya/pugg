        Camilla de Leon, a dance composer and accompanist in the 1930's and 40's, died on April 3 at Middlesex Hospital in Middletown, Conn. She was 80, and lived in Middletown.
        Ms. de Leon accompanied classes at the Martha Graham studio and composed for  choreographers including Pearl Primus, with whom she worked into the 1970's, and Katherine Dunham, Pearl Lang and Jean Erdman. As the only white member of the Primus troupe, Ms. de Leon frequently had to get meals and restroom keys surreptitiously for Primus's black dancers when the company toured in the South.
        Ms. de Leon also worked in the musical theater. She was rehearsal pianist for the original production of "South Pacific" and musical director for "You're  a Good Man, Charlie Brown." She taught voice and piano at Wesleyan University from 1972 to her death.
        She is survived by two daughters, Inara de Leon of Chappaqua, N.Y., and Winona de Leon of Monterey, Calif.; three sons, Noel, of Odense, Denmark; Michael, of Garberville, Calif., and Emile, of Middletown, and two sisters, Maude Merrill of Manhattan and Irene Novak of Westport, Conn.
