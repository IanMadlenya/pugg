        Peter H. Guertler, an authority on decorative painting and restoration of antique rooms, died on Thursday at his home in Southampton, L.I. He was 69.
        His wife, the former Mary Louise Cutler, said the cause was chronic pulmonary disease.
        Mr. Guertler was considered an expert in glazes, finishes and the restoration of wallpaper, spanning many periods and styles. He is best known for his work for Jacqueline Kennedy at the White House, including the restoration of the Diplomatic Reception Room and the Blue Room.
        He worked on the restoration of Boscobel, the 1806 mansion at Garrison-on-Hudson, N.Y. A long-standing client was the Frick Collection in Manhattan, which would call on him periodically to touch up its rooms. He also decorated the Wrightsman rooms of French furnishing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art with collections donated over 20 years.
        Mr. Guertler was born and educated in Basel, Switzerland, and immigrated to the United States after World War II. He attended the New York School of Interior Design from 1946 to 1947.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a sister, Elsa Guertler of Geneva, Switzerland.
