        Dr. Joseph Jordan, an analytical chemist and professor emeritus at Pennsylvania State University, died on Friday at his home in State College, Pa., near the University Park campus. He was 73 years old.
        He died of abdominal cancer, said Barbara K. Kennedy, a spokeswoman for the university.
        Dr. Jordan was an expert in bioelectrochemistry and the effects of heat on chemical reactions. His early research helped explain how hemoglobin transports oxygen in the blood and how artificial hemoglobin substitutes can be manufactured.
        More recently he played a role in the development of an instrument that enables diabetics to monitor their own blood-glucose levels.
        Dr. Jordan's research also involved sulfur compounds and their use in coal conversions and other coal-based technologies, as well as the electrochemistry of photovoltaic cells for solar-energy conversion.
        He was born in Timisoara, Romania, and earned his master's and Ph.D. degrees at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. He came to the United States in 1950 and held research fellowships at Harvard University and the University of Minnesota before joining the faculty at Penn State in 1954. He became a full professor of chemistry at its Eberly College of Science in 1960.
        Dr. Jordan is survived by his wife, the former Colina L. Fischer; a son, Adlai Jordan, of State College; three daughters, Saskia Jordan of Denver, Sharon Hoffman of Vista, Calif., and Naomi Gardner of Naples, Idaho, and six grandchildren.
