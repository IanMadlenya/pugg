        Professor Tryon, who specialized in social and intellectual history of the United States in the 19th century, wrote and edited many books in the field. He was the author of ''A Mirror for Americans,'' a three-volume account of life and manners in this country from 1790 to 1870 as recorded by American travelers, published in 1952.
        He was a graduate of Dartmouth College and received master's and doctoral degrees from Harvard. From 1927 to 1947 he taught at Simmons College. On his retirement from Boston University in 1967 he became visiting chairman of the history department at the Universidad Interamericana in San German, Puerto Rico.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Rachel Keller; two sons, Jeremy, of Washington and Jonathan, of Barrington, R.I.; four grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
