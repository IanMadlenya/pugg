        Roman J. Lexton, a retired Superior Court judge, died at his home here early today after a long illness. He was 70 years old.
        Judge Lexton retired in 1983 after 24 years on the bench. Until two months ago, he served as a state trial referee.
        Judge Lexton's judicial career started in 1959 in New Britain police court. Eight years later, he was made a Circuit Court judge.
        He was chief administrator of the Court of Common Pleas from 1974 until that court was merged with Circuit and Superior courts in 1978, when he became a Superior Court judge.
        Judge Lexton, as a one-man juror, investigated the conduct of nursing homes in Connecticut in 1979, an inquiry that resulted in three guilty pleas and the rewriting of nursing home safety regulations.
        He was a graduate of Wesleyan University and the University of Connecticut Law School, and was a Navy veteran of World War II.
        He is survived by his wife, Jane and twin daughters, Gail Martin and Terrie Tesorero, both of Rocky Hill.
