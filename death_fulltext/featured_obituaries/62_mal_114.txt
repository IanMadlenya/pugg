        Maris Cakars, an editor who was a leader in the movement against the Vietnam War, died on Saturday at Methodist Hospital in Brooklyn. He was 49 years old and lived in Brooklyn.
        He died of internal hemorrhaging, his family said.
        For 12 years he worked for Win, a small but influential magazine that opposed the Vietnam War and expanded to other social issues. It encouraged radical change but nonviolent tactics. He was the editor for about six years. Among those associated with Win were Abbie Hoffman, A. J. Muste and Hendrik Hertzberg.
        Mr. Cakars helped organize demonstrations, including one at the Pentagon and another at a military induction site in Manhattan at which Dr. Benjamin Spock was arrested. The organizations he worked with included the Committee for Non-Violent Action and the War Resisters League.
        Born in Riga, Latvia, he left with his parents in 1944 to escape Soviet occupation. The family came to America in 1949, and Mr. Cakars grew up in Oceanside, L.I.
        He studied at Lafayette College and Columbia University.
        Surviving are his wife of nearly 25 years, the former Susan Kent; a daughter, Andrea, of Brooklyn; a son, Janis, of Manhattan; his mother, Vera, of Huntington, L.I., and an adopted brother, Egils Melbardis of Mill Valley, Calif.
