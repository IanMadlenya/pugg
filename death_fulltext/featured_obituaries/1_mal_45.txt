        R. V. Carleton, an aviation pioneer and retired Braniff pilot and executive, died at a hospital Tuesday after a long illness. He was 81 year old.
        Mr. Carleton was one of Braniff International's first pilots, belonged to the exclusive Mach 2 Club and in 1950 was named one of the nation's top 10 pilots by Aviation Magazine. He was executive vice president of Braniff until his retirement in 1970.
        In 1961 he directed the Montreal symposium on guiding the development of the supersonic aircraft. In 1967 he became one of the few civilians ever to fly an F-104 Starfighter at twice the speed of sound, making him a member of the Mach 2 Club.
        Survivors include a daughter and a grandson.
