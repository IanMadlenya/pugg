        Mr. Sherman was not a comedian, but light comedy was his strong suit on Broadway. Time and again, critics singled him out for praise. Brooks Atkinson in The New York Times once called Mr. Sherman ''a clown of extraordinary drollness.''
        The Goodman Theater in Chicago was Mr. Sherman's first venue. It was there, in the late 1920's, that he learned his craft. His New York debut came in 1936 when he appeared with Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles in ''Horse Eats Hat,'' a Federal Theater Project production.
        Mr. Sherman had leading roles on Broadway in ''Sing Out the News'' (1938), ''Very Warm for May'' (1939), ''Boyd's Daughter'' (1940) and ''The Talley Method'' (1941). After serving in the Navy for five years, he returned to Broadway as Ragueneau in a 1946 production of ''Cyrano de Bergerac'' with Jose Ferrer.
        Other Broadway productions included ''Two's Company,'' with Bette Davis (1952), ''Three for Tonight'' (1955) and ''How Now, Dow Jones (1967). He played Shakespeare in summer stock, and appeared as Bottom in ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' at the New York World's Fair in 1939. He performed frequently at the American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Conn.
        As a member of the governing board of the Actors Equity Association, Mr. Sherman helped write a resolution in 1941 barring ''members of the Communist, Nazi or Fascist parties or their sympathizers from holding office in or being employed by Equity.'' The board was reacting to charges in Congress that Communists controlled the union.
        Mr. Sherman's first film role was in ''One-Third of a Nation,'' in 1938. He also starred in ''The Solid Gold Cadillac'' (1956) and ''Mary, Mary'' (1963).
