        Bob Waters, who covered boxing for Newsday for almost 30 years, died of cancer Saturday night. He was 66 years old.
        Mr. Waters gained a measure of fame in February 1964, when he was the only writer to predict correctly that Muhammad Ali, then known as Cassius Clay, would knock out Sonny Liston. That earned him a guest appearance on the television show ''I've Got a Secret.''
        Mr. Waters, who joined Newsday in 1958, traveled the world to cover Ali's championship fights and produced a series on ''Drought in Africa'' during his trip to that continent in 1974, when Ali regained the title by defeating George Foreman.
        Mr. Waters served as president of the Boxing Writers of America for two years in 1982-83 and was named by that group as winner of the 1978 Nat Fleischer Award for excellence in boxing journalism. Survivors include his mother, Helen; his wife, Alice; three sons, Robert, Christopher and Patrick; a daughter, Eileen Van Duyne; a brother, a sister and five grandchildren.
