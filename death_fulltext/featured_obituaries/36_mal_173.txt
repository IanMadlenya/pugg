        Frank Gervasi, a reporter who covered the Spanish Civil War and World War II in Europe, died yesterday after a stroke at Doctors Hospital in Manhattan. He was 81 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He was the author of 10 books, including a 1935-1945 memoir, ''The Violent Decade,'' published in 1989 by W. W. Norton.
        Born in 1908 in Baltimore, Mr. Gervasi attended the University of Pennsylvania, then became a reporter for The Philadelphia Record. In 1932, he joined The Associated Press.
        His career as a foreign correspondent began in 1934, when he covered a general strike in Spain for Universal Service. He became Rome bureau chief for Hearst's International News Service and joined Collier's Weekly at the start of World War II, covering the fall of Holland, Belgium and France. He later witnessed the long march of the British Eighth Army across the Libyan desert and landed with the American forces in Southern France.
        Mr. Gervasi was later a correspondent for The Washington Post, a syndicated columnist and, from 1950 to 1954, the chief of information for the Marshall Plan in Italy.
        He is survived by his wife, Georgia; a sister, Grace Beacham, of Chatanooga, Tenn.; a son, Sean, of Freeport, L.I., and two grandchildren.
