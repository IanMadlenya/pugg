        Jack Haskell, a familiar face to television viewers for some 30 years, first as the easygoing sidekick of Dave Garroway and then as a regular stand-in on Jack Paar's and Johnny Carson's shows, died on Saturday at the Actors Fund Nursing Home in Englewood, N.J. He was 79.
        Mr. Haskell put himself through college by working at radio stations in Chicago while attending Northwestern University, after which he served as a naval pilot in the Pacific during World War II. He was an early member of the ''Garroway at Large'' show when it was based in Chicago and came to New York to join Garroway on the original NBC ''Today'' show.
        He also worked with Jack Paar, substituting for the announcer Hugh Downs on occasion, and was a guest and replacement for Ed McMahon on ''Tonight'' when Johnny Carson was host. His television credits also included ''The Ed Sullivan Show,'' ''The Mike Douglas Show,'' ''The Bell Telephone Hour,'' ''The Garry Moore Show'' and NBC's ''Monitor.''
        Mr. Haskell, who was born in Akron, Ohio, and grew up in Cleveland, was also a singer. He performed with bands in the Chicago area during his college years, and after graduation he sang with Doris Day and the Les Brown Orchestra. He also performed in summer stock, singing in musicals like ''The Pajama Game,'' ''Brigadoon'' and ''Say, Darling,'' and in supper clubs like the Cotillion Room of the Pierre Hotel in New York. He appeared on Broadway in 1962 in ''Mr. President,'' an Irving Berlin musical that starred Nanette Fabray.
        He is survived by his wife, Helen, and a son, Thomas, both of Darien, Conn., and a granddaughter.
