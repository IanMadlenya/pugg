        Egon Orowan, a professor emeritus of mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, died Wednesday at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Mass., after a brief illness. He was 87 years old and lived in Cambridge.
        Mr. Orowan was born in Budapest and received a doctorate in engineering at the University of Vienna. One of his major contributions was the concept of dislocations in metals - the understanding of how materials plastically deform under stress.
        He joined the faculty at M.I.T. in 1950 and a year later was named George Westinghouse Professor of Mechanical Engineering. He retired from the active faculty in 1968.
        He won many honors, including the Paul Bergsoe Metal from the Danish Metallurgical Society in 1973. He was a fellow of the Royal Society of London and a member of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States.
        His wife, Jolan, died in 1986. Surviving is a daughter, Susan K. Martin of Washington.
