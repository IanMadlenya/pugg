        Raymond Jacobs, a drama therapist and administrator of the AIDS professional program at the Young Adult Institute in Manhattan, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 45.
        He died of causes related to AIDS nine years after he was found to be H.I.V.-positive, his family said.
        A native Californian, Mr. Jacobs graduated from the University of California Los Angeles and earned a master's degree in therapeutic recreation and a certificate of advanced study in recreation therapy at New York University.
        In 1983 he went to work for the Gay Men's Health Crisis, where he developed programs for AIDS education and prevention in the public schools. His association with the Young Adult Institute began five years ago and involved working with the mentally retarded and disabled.
        He was vice president of the Hetrick-Martin Institute for gay and lesbian youth. He also was a member of the AIDS advisory board of the city's Department of Education.
        Mr. Jacobs is survived by his companion, Michael Paley; his parents, Lloyd and Lucy, brothers Eddie and Bud, and sister, Barbara, all of Los Angeles.
