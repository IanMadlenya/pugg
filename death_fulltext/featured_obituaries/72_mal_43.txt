        Emil Mogul, a philanthropist and a former advertising and radio executive, died on Jan. 1 at Scripps Memorial Hospital in San Diego. He was 92.
        He died in his sleep, said his daughter, Suzanne Mogul Spector of Cardiff-by-the-Sea, Calif.
        Mr. Mogul lived in Longboat Key, Fla., until he moved to Solano Beach, Calif., last month. He founded the Emil Mogul Company, a Madison Avenue advertising agency, in 1939, with Barney's men's store as a major client.
        Mr. Mogul was a friend of Barney Pressman, the store's founder, for whom he had worked as a part-time sales clerk in the early 1930's. The Mogul agency became Mogul, Williams & Saylor in 1958, and Mr. Mogul became president and chairman.
        In 1966 he retired from the firm, which then became Mogul, Baker, Byrne & Weiss, and formed Basic Communications, a company that owned and operated radio stations. He later sold the company to Columbia Pictures and served as vice president of its radio station division until his retirement in 1977.
        Mr. Mogul was born in Manhattan. He worked during the day and attended high school at night. He later attended St. Lawrence University Law School, also at night.
        For many years he was a member of the board of directors of the United Jewish Appeal Federation of Jewish Philanthropies and of the Anti-Defamation League.
        Besides his daughter, Mr. Mogul is survived by his wife of 64 years, Helene; a son, Malcolm, of Chappaqua, N.Y., and six grandchildren.
