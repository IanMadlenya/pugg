        Louise Troy, a tall and elegant actress who was praised for performances in Broadway musicals, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 60.
        The cause was breast cancer, said Larry Keith, a friend.
        Miss Troy was applauded for what critics called her sprightly, winning, handsome and vivid performance as Edward Woodward's impatient second wife in the 1964 musical "High Spirits," based on Noel Coward's comedy "Blithe Spirit."
        "I lose three pounds a performance," she told an interviewer at the time, and her efforts won her a Tony Award nomination.
        Miss Troy also received Tony nominations for her acting in the 1963 musical "Tovarich" and the 1966 musical "Walking Happy."
        She had already won recognition for her acting in a 1954 production of Jean Cocteau's play "The Infernal Machine." One critic said she was able to take a classical play in stride without the solecisms familiar in the work of amateurs trained only for realism. Rarely Idle
        From 1974 through 1980, Miss Troy had starring roles in a dozen plays, including Coward's "Private Lives" and Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya." She also appeared in regional theater over the years.
        In addition, she appeared in a number of television series, including "The Defenders," "Hogan's Heroes," Room 222," "The Odd Couple" and "Kate and Allie." She also acted in the 1968 films "Yours, Mine and Ours" and "The Swimmer."
        Miss Troy, who was born in Manhattan, studied acting at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and with Lee Strasberg.
        Her 1969 marriage to Werner Klemperer, an actor, ended in divorce in 1974.
        She is survived by her second husband, Douglas Seale, who is an actor and stage director.
        A funeral service is scheduled for Monday at 11 A.M. at Grace Church, Broadway and 10th Street in Manhattan.
