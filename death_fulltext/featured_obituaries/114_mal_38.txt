        Luis Rodriguez, a Cuban boxer who won 107 of his 120 professional fights and  held the world welterweight title briefly in 1963, died on Monday at South Shore Hospital in Miami Beach. He was 59.
        Rodriguez had undergone kidney dialysis for the last two years and had a heart operation three weeks ago, according to a sister, Marcia Angulo.
        In a career that lasted from 1956 to 1972, Rodriguez, who was born in Camaguey, Cuba, won 49 fights by knockouts, but it was his unanimous 15-round decision over Emile Griffith at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles on March 21, 1963, that earned him the 147-pound title. It was the first of three title matchups that went the distance between the two.
        In their second meeting, at Madison Square Garden on June 8, 1963, Griffith regained the title on a split decision. A year later in Las Vegas, Nev., in another split decision, Griffith survived Rodriguez's challenge and retained the title.
        Rodriguez never became a champion again. He won 16 of his next 17 fights, then was stopped by Curtis Cokes in the 15th round of a World Boxing Association title elimination tournament match in 1966.
        After that loss, Rodriguez won 24 of 25 matches to earn a 160-pound world title shot against Nino Benvenuti at Rome in 1969. Rodriguez outboxed the Italian for 10 rounds, but was knocked out in the 11th.
        "He was a boxer-puncher," Rodriguez's former trainer, Angelo Dundee, said today. "He was quick with great balance. He came to the United States for a fight in Miami Beach and he never went back."
        Besides his sister, Marcia, Rodriguez is survived by his wife, Milagros; a son, Luis Jr.; his mother, Julia Gomez, and another sister, Clara Valdes.
