        Richard Dean McCarthy, a former Democratic Congressman from Buffalo, died last Friday at his home in Arlington, Va. He was 67.
        The cause was Lou Gehrig's disease, his family said.
        Mr. McCarthy, known as Max, represented a usually solid Republican district in suburban Buffalo from 1965 to 1970. He left his mark battling pollution and securing public-works projects for the area.
        He wrote two books, "The Ultimate Folly" (Alfred A. Knopf, 1969), a broadside against chemical-biological warfare, and "Elections for Sale" (Houghton Mifflin, 1972), which dealt with political fund-raising and spending.
        He did not seek re-election in 1970 but instead made an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination for Senator. In the 1970's, he was press attache at the United States Embassy in Iran and was a legislative aide in the Carter White House.
        He was the Washington bureau chief of The Buffalo News from 1978 until his retirement in 1989.
        Mr. McCarthy is survived by three sons, Richard D. Jr., of Buffalo, and Barry and Brendan W., both of Chicago; two daughters, Maura McCarthy of Manhattan, and Deirdre McCarthy of Buffalo; two sisters, Kathleen Campana of Dallas, and Patricia Kennedy of Jamestown, N.Y., and three grandchildren.
