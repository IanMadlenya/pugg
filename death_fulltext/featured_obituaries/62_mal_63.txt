        David Carroll, an actor in Broadway musicals, died on Wednesday at the BMG/RCA Recording Studio in Manhattan. He had been recording the cast album of "Grand Hotel" when he collapsed. He was 41 years old.
        He died of a pulmonary embolism, said his companion, Robert Homma.
        Mr. Carroll was best known for his portrayals of Baron Felix Von Gaigern in "Grand Hotel" and Anatoly in the musical "Chess." He received Tony Award nominations for both, but it was his work in "Grand Hotel" that established him as a leading Broadway performer.
        Mr. Carroll was born in Rockville Centre, L.I., and graduated from Dartmouth College, where he was a founding member of the college repertory company.
        He originated the title role in "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat" at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1976. He appeared on Broadway in "Oh, Brother!," "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers," "Cafe Crown," "Where's Charley?" and "The Wind in the Willows."
        He is survived by his parents, Derek and Joan Carroll of Stuart, Fla.; two brothers, Derek Jr., of Jupiter, Fla., and Kevin, of Memphis, and two sisters, Kathy Van Gorden and Mary Jeanne Fudell, both of Jupiter.
