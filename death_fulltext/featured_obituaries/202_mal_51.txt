        Earl Battey, a four-time All-Star catcher for the Minnesota Twins in the 1960's, died last Saturday at a hospital in Gainesville, Fla. Battey, who lived in Ocala, Fla., was 68.
        The cause was cancer, his wife, Sonia, said.
        Battey played for 13 seasons in the major leagues and had a career batting average of .270 with 104 home runs. He made his debut with the Chicago White Sox in 1955, joined the Washington Senators in 1960, then played for their successor franchise, the Twins, from 1961-67.
        He was an All-Star in 1962, 1963, 1965 and 1966 and received Gold Glove awards for his fielding from 1960 to '62. He was named to the Twins' 40th anniversary team in 2000. Battey played on the Twins' 1965 American League championship team, hitting .297 that season. The Twins lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in a seven-game World Series.
        After his playing days, Battey provided clinics for youngsters in a joint program by Con Edison and the Yankees in which he was known as the ''answer man.''
        In addition to his wife, Battey is survived by three sons, Earl, Corey and Darren; two daughters, Brenda Battey and Barbara Johnson; his mother, Esther Battey; three brothers, Charles, Rodney and Sonney; three sisters, Sheryle Bowler, Lynn Ford and Kathleen Williams; and four grandchildren.
