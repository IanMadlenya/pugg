        Doris Muser deKeyserlingk, the first woman granted tenure at Williams College, was found dead Tuesday at her home in Williamstown. She was 86 years old.
        Mrs. deKeyserlingk, a retired associate professor of Russian and German, moved to the United States in 1937 to join her German fiance, a lawyer, Baron Klaus deKeyserlingk, who had spoken out against Hitler. She became a United States citizen in 1946.
        The deKeyserlingks returned to Germany in 1946 to participate in the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals. She served as an interpreter. In 1958 she was hired by Williams to head its newly revived Russian studies program. Eight years later, she became the first tenured woman faculty member since the college's founding in 1793.
        She is survived by a sister, Lisbeth Haar, of Stockholm, Sweden, and a brother, Robert Muser, of Geneva, Switzerland.
