        Ronald M. Rosenfeld, an important figure in the ''creative revolution'' that swept the advertising industry in the 1960's and 1970's, died yesterday at Beth Israel Hospital from complications of a stroke he suffered in 1991. He was 65.
        Mr. Rosenfeld was born in Baltimore, where he started his career at 16 as an office boy in the ad department of a local department store. He moved to New York in 1957 and joined Doyle Dane Bernbach, one of the largest agencies in the business. He was co-copy chief and later a vice president and creative management supervisor, with accounts such as the Jamaica Tourist Board and the Soft Whiskey campaign for Calvert's Extra. His slogan for Rheingold beer, ''We must be doing something right,'' became an enduring part of the language.
        In 1969, he joined the J. Walter Thompson agency as the creative director, and a year later founded Rosenfeld, Sirowitz & Harper, later known as Rosenfeld, Sirowitz, Humphrey & Strauss. In contrast with the larger companies at the time, a creative team of copywriters, art directors and marketing specialists would work closely with the client. Rosenfeld, Sirowitz produced an ad for Swissair titled ''Heidi Lied'' that generated an enormous amount of attention for both the firm and its rather staid advertiser.
        Mr. Rosenfeld once described the problem with most advertising as ''an enormous lack of taste.'' He went on to describe his own advertising philosophy: ''You have to stay honest with yourself. I am what I am and I'm a bad imitator.''
        He remained at the firm until 1991.
        In 1971 at the age of 38, Mr. Rosenfeld had become the youngest copywriter ever elected to the Copywriter's Hall of Fame.
        He is survived by his wife, Toni Pagano Rosenfeld of Manhattan, and two children, Bonnie Schneider of Baldwin, N.Y., and Ned Rosenfeld of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
