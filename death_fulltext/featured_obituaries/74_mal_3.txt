        Mr. Benito retired a decade ago. After he left the company, its name was changed to Fahlgren Martin. The name was changed again to Fahlgren Martin Benito.
        Mr. Benito and his company developed a reputation for promoting the Tampa Bay area. He was named Tampa's Citizen of the Year in 1980 and was co-chairman of the Tampa Super Bowl Host Committee in 1983.
        The son of a cigarmaker, Mr. Benito was born and reared in Tampa. He started out as an errand boy in an advertising agency in the 1930's and in 1954 established his own agency in a one-room office in the Tampa Theater building.
        Mr. Benito is survived by his wife, Helen; three sons, John and Davian, both of Tampa, and Luis of Seattle; four daughters, Mary Charles Fleming, Cristina Moss, and Conchita Root, all of Tampa, and Olga of Atlanta, and eight grandchildren.
