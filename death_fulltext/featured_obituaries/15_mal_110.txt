        Lionel S. Reiss, a painter known for his interpretations of Jewish life, died last Saturday at his home on Central Park West in Manhattan. He was 94 years old, and had been in poor health since last fall.
        Born in Jaroslav, Poland, Mr. Reiss grew up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan and studied commercial art. In the early 1920's, he left an advertising job to bicycle through Europe, Africa and the Middle East making portraits of Jewish people and landmarks in Jewish history. A selection of the portraits, with his conclusion that there was essentially no such thing as a Jewish race, was published in 1938 in a book, ''My Models Were Jews.''
        A 1954 book, ''New Lights and Old Shadows,'' dealt with ''the new lights'' of a reborn Israel and the ''old shadows'' of a vanished European ghetto. His last book, ''A World of Twilight'' (1972), with text by Isaac Bashevis Singer and Milton Hindus, was a portrait of the Jewish communities in Eastern Europe before the Holocaust.
        Among the institutions with his work in their collections are the Brooklyn Museum and the Jewish Museum in New York, the National Portrait Gallery and the Tel Aviv and Bezalel museums in Israel.
        Mr. Reiss is survived by a son, Dr. David Reiss, of Washington; two grandchildren, and a great-grandchild. His wife, Frances, died in 1984.
