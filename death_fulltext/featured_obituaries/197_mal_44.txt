        Dave Polansky, who replaced the highly respected Nat Holman as basketball coach at City College and carved out a solid record of his own, died last Monday at St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 83 and lived in Manhattan.
        Taking over as coach for Holman was a regular practice for Polansky during the 1950's, when City College was at the center of the basketball scandals in New York City and was de-emphasizing a program that had climbed to No. 1 in the nation in 1950 while attracting sellout crowds at Madison Square Garden.
        Polansky twice filled in for Holman before taking over for good four games into the 1959-60 season; Holman retired after 37 seasons and 423 victories. Over the next seven seasons, Polansky's teams had a 68-58 record, including City University of New York championships in 1966, 1967 and 1968.
        Polansky, a member of the college's faculty during his coaching career, retired during the 1971-72 season, when the Beavers won another CUNY title. His overall record was 127-135.
        The link between the Beaver coaches began when Polansky played guard under Holman from 1938-40. He also earned varsity letters in cross-country and track before graduating in 1942. A half-miler, Polansky won the Metropolitan Amateur Athletic Union title in 1941 and the National Junior A.A.U. title in 1942. He coached the varsity track team at City College before entering the service in 1943.
        In 1970, the college named him to its athletic hall of fame for his track skills, some of which he carried into his basketball coaching career by running wind sprints with his players before practices.
        When Holman's 1950 national championship team was gutted in 1951 after several players were implicated in the betting scandals, Holman took a leave of absence for two seasons and Polansky took his place. With teams that were often overmatched by major college opponents, Polansky posted records of 10-6 and 10-8.
        Holman resumed coaching from 1954-56, then took a sabbatical for two more seasons. Again Polansky filled in, with teams that went 11-8 and 9-8. Holman returned in 1959, and his record was 0-4 when he turned the team over to Polansky for good.
        Polansky is survived by his wife, Corinne, of Manhattan; and two sons, Jerrold and Jon, and a granddaughter, Lauren, all of San Francisco.
