        Alan North, a character actor whose career spanned more than 50 years, died on Jan. 19 at a hospital near his home in Port Jefferson, N.Y. He was 79 and also had a home in Manhattan.
        The cause was kidney and lung cancer, his wife, June, said.
        Across five decades, Mr. North portrayed a wealth of characters on the stage and screen, appearing in some 30 films, including ''Plaza Suite,'' ''Serpico,'' ''. . . And Justice for All,'' ''Thief of Hearts,'' ''Billy Galvin,'' ''Lean on Me'' and ''I'm Not Rappaport.'' A frequent player on such early television series as ''The Jackie Gleason Show,'' ''Studio One'' and the Ellery Queen mystery series, he landed one of his most prominent  and popular roles in 1982 as the co-star, with Leslie Nielsen, of the short-lived ABC spoof ''Police Squad!''
        On the stage, Mr. North shuttled between musical comedies and straight plays, making his Broadway debut in the 1955 musical ''Plain and Fancy.'' He went on to perform in ''Conversations With My Father,'' ''Dylan,'' the City Center revival of ''South Pacific,'' ''Plaza Suite'' and ''Marilyn'' before his final stage performance last spring in the Signature Theater production of John Guare's ''Lake Hollywood.''
        Mr. North, who was born in the Bronx, served in the United States Navy during World War II before venturing into the theater, initially as a stage manager. Early on he was the host of a pre- and post-game television show for the Baltimore Orioles and broadcast his own sports program on WRC-TV in Washington.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Alexandra Jackson of Rocky Point, N.Y., and Victoria North of Port Jefferson, and three grandchildren.
