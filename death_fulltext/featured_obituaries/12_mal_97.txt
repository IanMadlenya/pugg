        Donald Healey, designer of Austin-Healey sports cars in Britain, died last Wednesday after a short illness, his family said today. He was 89 years old.
        Healey entered into a joint production with the Austin Motor Company to produce Austin-Healey sports cars, which became very popular in the 1950's.
        In 1931, he became the first Briton to win the Monte Carlo Rally. In 1956, he drove his 3-liter Healey at 203 miles per hour on the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah.
        He is survived by three sons.
