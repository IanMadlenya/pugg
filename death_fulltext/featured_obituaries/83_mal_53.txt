        George W. Dean Jr., a civil rights lawyer who argued a case that forced Alabama to revamp its mental-health system and influenced similar changes in other states, died on Tuesday at his home in Chestertown, Md. He was 64.
        The apparent cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        A talented trial lawyer known for his courtroom flamboyance, Mr. Dean represented patients in Alabama's mental hospitals in a class-action suit in the 1970's. That suit led to a landmark ruling by United States District Judge Frank M. Johnson in Alabama that spelled out the constitutional right of the mentally ill to receive decent care.
        Judge Johnson's ruling in the case, Wyatt v. Stickney, led to an overhaul in what was a crowded, understaffed and generally deplored mental health system. The outcome drew notice from mental-health experts across the country.
        Born in Montgomery, Mr. Dean graduated from the University of Alabama in 1952 and earned his law degree there four years later. He was editor of the university's Law Review.
        He made his reputation as a strong advocate of civil rights in his native state. He also made a fortune later in life doing legal work involving the estate of the late billionaire Howard R. Hughes.
        Roger Sayers, president of the University of Alabama, said Mr. Dean's "advocacy in establishing the decent and humane treatment for the institutionalized profoundly improved the quality of life for thousands of people all across the nation."
        Mr. Dean is survived by his wife, Jane, four daughters and a son.
