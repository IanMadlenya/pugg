        Cesar Ortiz Tinoco, a senior information officer for the United Nations for 30 years, died on June 17 at his home in Ealing in west London. He was 75 years old.
        His death of a hemorrhage from a gastric ulcer became known in New York yesterday from a family member.
        Mr. Ortiz, a Mexican citizen who was fluent in five languages and held a law degree, was with the United Nations from its earliest days, in 1946, to his retirement in 1976.
        He spent 10 years with press and radio organizations, including The Associated Press, before joining the United Nations. He chose a United Nations career, the family member, Joyce Lambert, said, on the advice of Representative Lyndon B. Johnson, who first had been impressed by the young man's linguistic abilities as his high school teacher in Texas in 1931.
        Mr. Ortiz is survived by his wife of 38 years, Elizabeth Lambert Ortiz, the author of many articles and books on the cuisines of Mexico and other Latin American and Caribbean countries.
