        Gen. Tan Zheng, a former Deputy Defense Minister and a veteran of the Long March, died today in Beijing, the Central Military Commission said. He was 82 years old.
        The official New China News Agency, which carried the announcement, did not give the cause of death or other details.
        General Tan was a native of Hunan province in central China, like the leader of the Chinese Communist revolution, the late Mao Zedong, and joined in an unsuccessful peasant uprising led by Mao in the autumn of 1927 against the Nationalist Government of Chiang Kai-shek.
        He briefly served as Mao's personal secretary and took part in the Long March, the grueling 1934-35 retreat by the Red Army from southeastern China to the northwest.
        The General held political posts in the army throughout the civil war against the Nationalists, which ended in 1949 with Communist victory. In 1954, he became Deputy Defense Minister and later was named head of the army's General Political Department. He lost both posts in the 1960's, shortly before being purged during the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76.
        After being rehabilitated in 1975, General Tan was an adviser to the Central Military Commission, which sets overall military policy, and held several posts in the nominal Parliament. He retired in 1984.
