        Robert M. Glasse, an anthropologist who helped to trace a fatal neurological disease among New Guinea natives, died on Friday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. He was 63 and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of cancer, his wife, Bernadette, said.
        Dr. Glasse was the anthropologist on a New Guinea Public Health Department team that studied the deadly kuru disease from 1961 to 1963. The project helped win a Nobel Prize for its chief epidemiologist, D. Carleton Gajdusek.
        Interviewing members of the Fore tribe, Dr. Glasse helped to track the course of kuru in family trees and record the customs that spread it. After it was found that the disease was a result of handling and eating human brain tissue, the tribe changed its practices and the epidemic ended. Profound Changes
        Earlier he lived among the Huli people of Papua, New Guinea, from 1955 to 1960. In a book, "Huli of Papua," published in 1968, he documented their highly developed art of warfare, social organization, religion, symbolism and taboos on mingling between men and women.
        Returning in 1979, he found the Huli profoundly changed by conversion to Christianity. Warfare was supplanted by the sport of archery, and violent deaths decreased, bachelor cults faded and women became more independent.
        Dr. Glasse was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Manhattan.
        After graduating from City College in 1951, he earned a doctorate at the Australian National University in 1963. He also studied at Adelaide University, Sydney University and College de France.
        He joined Queens College in New York in 1965 and retired there as a professor in 1990.
        His first marriage ended in divorce.
        In addition to his wife of 26 years, the former Bernadette Bucher, a professor of literature and intercultural studies at Fordham, he is survived by a sister, Carmen Simmons of Baton Rouge, La.
