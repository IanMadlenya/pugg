        Frederick G. Marcham, who became one of the nation's longest-serving professors in a 68-year teaching career at Cornell University, died on Wednesday at his home in Ithaca, N.Y. He was 94.
        The cause of death was not specified, but a Cornell spokeswoman said he had been in failing health.
        In his many roles at Cornell, Dr. Marcham was a history professor specializing in the British Constitution and served two periods as chairman of the history department.
        He was also a boxing coach and the first chairman of the Ivy League athletic eligibility committee. In 1987 he won Cornell's first award for exceptional service.
        He also served 32 years as the mayor of the village of Cayuga Heights, where he fought annexation by the City of Ithaca. He retired from that office in 1988 at the age of 90.
        Dr. Marcham was born in Reading, England. At the age of 11 he won a scholarship to Christ's Hospital School. After serving in the British Army in World War I, he won a veteran's scholarship to Oxford University.
        He went to Cornell as a graduate student in 1923 and began teaching there the next year. He formally retired in 1969, became a professor emeritus and continued teaching until this Oct. 14.
        His wife of 52 years, the former Mary Deacon, died in 1977.
        He is survived by a daughter, Ann Marcham of Ithaca; two sons, David, of Quincy, Mass., and John, of Ithaca; a sister, Doris Downs of Reading; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
