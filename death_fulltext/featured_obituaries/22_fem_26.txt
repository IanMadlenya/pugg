        Marian P. Welch, the editor of two publications for the John Birch Society, which was founded by her late husband, died Tuesday at Glover Memorial Hospital. She was 88 years old.
        Mrs. Welch, who graduated from Wellesley College in 1922, was editor of the society's weekly newspapers, The New American and Review of the News.
        The society was founded in 1958 by 12 men, including her husband, Robert, and named after a young American missionary who was killed in China in 1954. The group has its headquarters in Belmont, a Boston suburb, where the Welches lived for 40 years. Robert Welch died in 1985.
        The John Birch Society first gained national attention in the 1950's when it accused former President Eisenhower and Secretary of State John Foster Dulles of being implicated in a Communist plot to take over the United States Government.

        An obituary by The Associated Press in some copies last Sunday about Marian P. Welch, editor of two John Birch Society publications, described the namesake of the society incorrectly. Capt. John Birch, a missionary in China before World War II, served in the war as an intelligence officer. He was killed by Chinese Communists on Aug. 25, 1945, 10 days after V-J Day.
