        Robert Bierman, president of the Jandus Electric Construction Corporation of Long Island City, Queens, died on Wednesday after suffering a heart attack while driving on the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway near Pelham, N.Y., his brother-in-law, Seth Bartner, said yesterday. He was 59 years old and lived in Manhattan.

He was a founder of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation in Manhattan.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Claire Bartner; three daughters, Karen, of Manhattan, Evelyn Velasquez of Key Biscayne, Fla., and Dr. Laura Waurin of Los Angeles; his mother, Rose Bayles of Plantation, Fla.; a sister, Dr. Sheila Blume of Sayville, L.I., and two grandchildren.
