        Vanni B. Montana, an opponent of fascism and Communism in Italy and an advocate of unionism in the United States, died on Sunday at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 89 years and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of a stroke, his family said.
        Mr. Montana was born in Mazara del Allo, Italy. As a foe of fascism, he fled his native land for Paris and Belgium, where for five years he studied political science and journalism and worked with Italian immigrants.
        In 1928 he came to the United States and took up labor causes while also leading protests against developments in Italy. An officer of the underground Italian socialist movement, he organized and led rallies in New York City against the fascists and urged resistance to the Mussolini regime. Later he worked with American officials in opposing Communism in Italy.
        He was a co-founder the Italian American Labor Council. For 34 years he was the associate editor of Giustizia, an Italian publication of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, and was an education officer for Local 89 of that union. He also was a correspondent for Italian newspapers here and abroad.
        His survivors include his wife, Helene; two sons, Victor, of Portsmouth, N.H., and John, of Manhattan; a brother, Santo Buscemi of Mazara del Allo, and a grandson.
