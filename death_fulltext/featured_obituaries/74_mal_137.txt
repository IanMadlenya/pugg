        Rabbi Sidney L. Regner, a retired officer of the Central Conference of American Rabbis who was active in the peace movement, died on Tuesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 89 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was complications from pneumonia, said his daughter, Babette Melmed of Stamford, Conn.
        When the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the organization of Reform rabbis, established its headquarters in New York City in 1954, Rabbi Regner became its first executive vice president. He retired in 1971.
        He was a delegate of the conference to the Synagogue Council of America from 1955 to 1971 and a member of its executive committee. He was also a member of the governing body of the World Union for Progressive Judaism and served on the Rabbinical Pension Board.
        In 1966, Rabbi Regner was a member of a delegation of American rabbis who went to the Soviet Union and reported on the grim life of Soviet Jews. The rabbis appealed for the right of Soviet Jews to be reunited with families scattered by World War II.
        Born in Manhattan, he graduated from the University of Cincinnati and was ordained in 1927 at the Hebrew Union College, which gave him an honorary degree of doctor of divinity in 1954.
        He served as rabbi of Temple Oheb Sholom in Reading, Pa., from 1927 to 1954. During this ministry he was president of the Reading chapter of B'nai B'rith, the Berks County Peace Council and the Council of Social Agencies.
        He was predeceased by his wife, the former Dorothy Marcus, and a son, Norman.
        Besides his daughter, he is survived by another son, James, of Honolulu; five grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
