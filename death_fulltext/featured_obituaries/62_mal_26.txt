        Samuel Marx, a writer, film producer and story editor for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, died on Monday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was 90 years old.
        He died of congestive heart failure, said his son, Richard, of Los Angeles.
        Mr. Marx's long career in the film industry is reflected in his books about Hollywood, among them "A Gaudy Spree: The Literary Life of Hollywood in the 1930's" and "Mayer and Thalberg: The Make-Believe Saints." He was also a consultant on a documentary film, "M-G-M: When the Lion Roars," to be broadcast by TNT cable television March 22 to 24.
        Mr. Marx attended the Columbia School of Journalism and wrote for newspapers and trade journals. In 1930, he moved to Hollywood to become a story editor for M-G-M, supervising a group of writers that included William Faulkner, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Moss Hart. While at the studio, he produced 13 movies for the studio, including the 1943 "Lassie Come Home."
        He was a story editor at Columbia Pictures for a year and during the 1950's produced several television series, including four "General Electric Hour" shows and "Northwest Passage."
        Among the books he co-wrote are "Rodgers and Hart: Bewitched, Bothered and Bedeviled" (1977), with Jan Clayton, and "Deadly Illusions" (1990), with Joyce Vanderveen.
        In addition to his son, he is survived by his second wife, Sara; another son, Kenneth, of St. Paul, Ark.; two grandsons, and a granddaughter.
