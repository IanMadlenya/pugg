        Mr. Brown played the rancher Ed O'Connor for 10 years. In films, Mr. Brown acted with Wallace Beery, Tyrone Power, Lana Turner and Victor McLaglen.
        He began modeling when he was 2 years old and appeared as the Arrow Collar Boy, the Buick Boy and Buster Brown. At the age of 9, when he had already appeared in films and onstage, a newspaper report called him as ''The Hero in Daring Rescue'' for saving a young woman from drowning.
        When he was 14, Mr. Brown appeared in ''The Lady Lies'' with Walter Huston, Claudette Colbert and Charles Ruggles. He was singled out as having to ''shoulder a good deal of the plot.''
        He acted in numerous feature films, including ''Hell's Highway'' with Richard Dix, ''This Side of Heaven'' with Lionel Barrymore and Fay Bainter, ''Navy Blue and Gold'' with James Stewart, ''Gentle Julia'' with Jane Withers, ''Maytime'' with Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy, ''Old Chicago'' with Mr. Power and Don Ameche, ''These Glamour Girls'' with Miss Turner and ''Sergeant Madden'' with Mr. Beery.
        Mr. Brown is survived by two sons, Tuttle and and Chris, and his daughter, Cathleen Dougherty.
