        Charles Schucker, a second-generation Abstract Expressionist, died on Jan. 17 at Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn Heights. He was 89 and lived in Brooklyn Heights.
        Mr. Schucker was born in Gap, Pa., in 1908 and attended the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore, graduating with honors in 1933. After winning a school scholarship for a trip to Europe, he settled in Chicago, where he worked for the Works Progress Administration and had his first solo exhibition at the Benjamin Krohn Gallery in 1940.
        He moved to Brooklyn Heights in 1946, teaching at New York University, City College and, from 1956 to 1985, the Pratt Institute.
        After moving to New York, Mr. Schucker's art became increasingly abstract, combining elements of Jackson Pollock's techniques with the stronger colors of Color Field painting. He received a Guggenheim fellowship in 1953.
        From 1946 to 1978, he had solo shows at the MacBeth Gallery, the Howard Wise Gallery and the Max Hutchinson Gallery, as well as an exhibition in 1971 at the Whitney Museum of American Art. His work is in the Whitney, the Brooklyn Museum of Art and the Newark Art Museum.
        Mr. Schucker is survived by his wife, the former Margaret Hamilton Rust; two daughters, Cheryl Chang  of Los Angeles, and Carrie Schucker Derowitz of Davis, Calif.; a sister, Olga Stirling, and a brother, George Schucker, both of Baltimore, and three grandchildren.
