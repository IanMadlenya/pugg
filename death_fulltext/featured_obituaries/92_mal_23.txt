        Christopher Coe, a novelist, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 41.
        The cause was AIDS, said his sister, Kally Kumler.
        Mr. Coe's first novel, "I Look Divine," was published in 1987. It is the story of Nicholas, a pathologically narcissistic homosexual, told by his older brother after Nicholas's death. In a review in The New York Times, Richard Burgin wrote that Mr. Coe was "an icy and acute observer" who had "chosen a difficult theme -- self-love -- and understands both its comedy and its tragedy."
        His second novel, "Such Times," published last year, is about the long-term affair of two men, the older of whom has died of AIDS, leaving his lover to piece together their shared story. Andrea Barnet wrote in The New York Times that Mr. Coe was "a daring writer, as unflinchingly honest about his characters' affectations and fatuous desires, their treacheries and small self-deceptions, as he is about the truth of their hearts."
        He is survived by his sister, of Poland, Ohio.
