        Harry S. Sellers, a retired Navy captain and the founder and chief executive of a self-service storage operation, died on Wednesday at his home in Arlington, Va. He was 70.
        His family said he had died of cancer.
        He was born in Glendora, Calif., and joined the Navy in World War II, spending much of his career as an aviator. He served in the Korean War and commanded the aircraft carrier Franklin D. Roosevelt off Vietnam in 1969. Captain Sellers retired in 1972 after serving on the staff of the Chief of Naval Operations.
        He then established U-Store, which operates in the Washington-Baltimore area and in Florida.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Helen Heald; two sons, Darrow, of Monterey, Calif., and Richard, of Arlington, and four grandchildren.
