        Erik F. B. Fries, a former professor of biology at City College of New York, died last Wednesday at Falmouth (Mass.) Hospital. He was 91 years old and lived in Woods Hole, Mass.
        He died of complications of Parkinson's disease, his stepdaughter, Joan Lightbourn of Nassau, the Bahamas, said.
        Dr. Fries, a 1930 graduate of Harvard with a Ph.D. in biology, joined the City College faculty in 1933, after working as a consulting editor with a publishing company. He retired in 1966. He was also a former summer research assistant at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and wrote papers on pigmentation cells and color changes in fish. He served in the Navy during World War II.
        In addition to his stepdaughter, he is survived by his wife, Eleanor; a stepson, John P. Bethel of St. James, L.I., and four grandchildren.
