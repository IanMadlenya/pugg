        Henry Brandon, an actor whose ex-perience ranged from Shakespeare in New York theater to westerns in Hollywood, died, apparently of a heart attack, on Feb. 15 in Los Angeles. He was 77 years old.
        In films like ''The Searchers,'' John Ford's 1956 western, Mr. Brandon often depicted villains or characters who verged on the exotic. On stage, he frequently drew favorable attention from critics, as when he received favorable mention for heading the cast of a 1957 New York revival of ''The Lady's Not for Burning,'' by Christopher Fry.
        Among his other stage credits were ''Medea,'' with Judith Anderson, at the City Center in 1949, and a Broadway production of ''Twelfth Night'' in 1949. Although much of his time was devoted to films, he continued to act in the theater until 1985, when he appeared in Florida in a production of ''Arsenic and Old Lace.''
        Mr. Brandon was born in Berlin in 1912 and arrived in Hollywood with his family while still a baby. As a young man he caught the eye of Hal Roach, producer of the Laurel and Hardy movie comedies, and was hired under his real name, Henry Kleinbach.
        Between 1936 and the early 1980's he appeared in more than 75 feature films, including ''The Paleface,'' ''The Ten Commandments,'' ''Beau Geste,'' ''Joan of Arc,'' ''Wake of the Red Witch,'' ''Two Rode Together'' and ''Pony Express.''
        He is survived by a brother and a sister.
