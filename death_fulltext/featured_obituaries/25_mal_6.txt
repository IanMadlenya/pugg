        Robert A. Henle, director of the advanced silicon technology laboratory at the International Business Machines Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., died of lymphoma Friday at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. He was 64 years old and lived in Clinton Corners, N.Y.
        Mr. Henle joined I.B.M. in 1951 after graduating from the University of Minnesota and worked on development of the first all-transistor computer and on high-speed circuitry for later models.
        In 1964 he was named an I.B.M. Fellow and concentrated on monolithic- memory technology, the use of which made possible the memory components of the company's most important computer products.
        After serving as manager of advanced technology for the I.B.M. components laboratory, he was named director of the advanced silicon technology laboratory in 1981.
        He received a citation from the Department of Defense in 1974 for exceptionally meritorious civilian service and was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1982.
        Mr. Henle is survived by his wife, the former Carol Dumas; three sons, Robert, of Boca Raton, Fla., David, of Bronxville, N.Y., and John, of Manhattan; a daughter, Barbara Henle-Hyman of Burlington, Vt., and a sister, Donna Moomaw of Loveland, Colo.
