        Dr. Matthew Suffness, a medical research manager who helped develop the cancer drug taxol, died on Wednesday at Holy Cross Hospital in Silver Spring, Md. He was 52 and lived in Silver Spring.
        The cause was pneumonia, said a colleague, Tony Mead of the National Cancer Institute. Dr. Suffness had received a bone-marrow transplant in November to treat leukemia.
        Dr. Suffness was the program director for the Grants and Contracts Operations Branch of the National Cancer Institute. He participated in the development of taxol, a substance isolated from the Pacific yew tree that has been found to have cancer-killing effects, by helping secure contracts and grants to speed the research. He also started and managed a national program to increase the development of cancer drugs through research grants.
        He wrote more than 60 articles and a book on the development of cancer drugs.
        He came to the National Cancer Institute in 1976 after several years in research and teaching at Ohio Northern University.
        He was born on Staten Island and received a bachelor's degree in pharmacy from Howard University and a doctorate in pharmaceutical chemistry from the University of Wisconsin.
        Dr. Suffness is survived by his wife, Rita Suffness; a brother, Lawrence, of Silver Spring, and a sister, Frances, of Pine Bush, N.Y.
