        Samuel Carey Bullock, a Philadelphia psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, died on  Oct. 11 at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia. He was 74.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        A scion of a distinguished Washington family, Dr. Bullock carried on a tradition of academic achievement and public service. Before his retirement five years ago, he was deputy chairman and professor in the department of mental health services at Hahnemann University in Philadelphia.
        He was the seventh of eight children born to the Rev. George Oliver Bullock and Rebecca Burgess Bullock. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1943 and received his M.D. at the New York University College of Medicine in 1946 -- the  only black graduate in both classes.
        He trained at the Philadelphia Psychoanalytic Society at a time when few black doctors worked in his field. After service as a captain in the Army overseas, he joined Philadelphia's department of mental health and rose to section chief of therapy and clinical services.
        Before he arrived at Hahnemann in 1977, he was chairman and professor in the  department of psychiatry at Howard University in Washington. He maintained a private practice in Philadelphia and was a consultant to numerous organizations, including the Philadelphia Prison Training Academy.
        He contributed many scientific articles, reflecting among other things his research on perceptions of racism harbored by black medical students. Much of his effort was directed toward increasing the number of black medical students and improving their quality of life.
        He was a well-known figure in Martha's Vineyard as one of the first blacks to own a home on the island.
        Dr. Bullock is survived by his wife, Gloria Wallace Bullock; a son, Wallace G., of Manhattan; a daughter, Dr. Anne C. B. Sanders of Atlanta; a brother, Joseph, of Washington, and a granddaughter.
