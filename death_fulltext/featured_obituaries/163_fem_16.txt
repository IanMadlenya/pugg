        Eva Gatling, an art historian and curator who for many years was the director of the Heckscher Museum in Huntington, N.Y., died on Tuesday at the Westminister-Canterbury, a continuing care community in Virginia Beach, Va., where she had lived in recent years. She was 87.
        ''The majority of the museums in America are small,'' Ms. Gatling once wrote. ''They have a potential for greatness that often escapes public attention.'' As head of the Heckscher from 1962 to 1978, she turned it into a valuable suburban museum.
        Ronald G. Pisano, an art curator, said, ''She had an unerring eye for art, and was responsible for enriching the Heckscher collection with significant acquisitions, and elevating its reputation to that of one of the finest regional museums in America.''
        August Heckscher founded the museum in 1920. In the 1950's it showed works from its permanent collection on a limited schedule. Under Ms. Gatling's leadership, the museum expanded the collection and held four or five major exhibitions each year. She rediscovered the work of Helen Torr and was instrumental in acquiring many paintings by Arthur Dove, Ms. Torr's husband. George Grosz's ''Eclipse of the Sun'' became the centerpiece of the collection.
        Eva Ingersoll Gatling was born in Mobile, Ala., and graduated from the University of Alabama and Yale University.
        Before joining the Heckscher, she was director of exhibitions at Duke University, curator at the Museum of the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and assistant director of the Des Moines Art Center in Iowa.
        When Ms. Gatling retired, the Heckscher honored her with an exhibition, ''The Art of the Director: Eva Gatling's 15 Years at the Heckscher Museum.'' In 1996, another exhibition, ''A Founding Director's Legacy,'' was a tribute to her.
        There are no immediate survivors.
