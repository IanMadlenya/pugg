        Ho Dam, Foreign Minister of North Korea from 1971 to 1983, has died after a long illness, the official press agency reported on Sunday. He was 62 years old.
        Mr. Ho died Saturday night, the report said. It gave no details of his illness.
        Mr. Ho, a member of the ruling Politburo of North Korea's Communist Party, was also chairman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, which made nominal efforts to reunite the Communist North with the capitalist South.
        As Foreign Minister in 1977, Mr. Ho became the first senior North Korean official to visit the United States. He left the Foreign Minister's job in 1983 and became secretary of the Communist Party. Last year, he was named chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, North Korea's rubber-stamp parliament.
