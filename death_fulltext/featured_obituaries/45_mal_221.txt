        Bennie Oosterbaan, a three-sport varsity star and the coach of the last University of Michigan football team to finish with the No. 1 national ranking, died Thursday night. He was 84 years old and had been living in an Ann Arbor nursing home after suffering a broken hip several weeks ago.
        At Michigan in the 1920's he lettered in football, basketball and baseball. As an end, he led the Big Ten in touchdowns in 1925 with eight, catching passes thrown by Benny Friedman under the coaching of Fielding Yost. He was an all-American in basketball in 1928.
        Mr. Oosterbaan became an assistant football coach in 1928 and head coach in 1948, when Michigan went 9-0 and was ranked No. 1. During his 11 years as coach, Michigan won three Big Ten championships and achieved a Rose Bowl victory in 1951 over California, 14-6. His teams compiled a 66-33-4 record.
        Mr. Oosterbaan, born in Muskegon, Mich., in 1906, was director of athletic alumni relations until he retired in 1972.
        He is survived by a sister, Grace Hedner; a daughter, Anna Wilson of Traverse City, Mich., and two grandsons.
