        William T. Carroll, a Democrat who served as a Connecticut State Treasurer and a Lieutenant Governor and as a three-term Mayor of Torrington, died on Sunday at the Valerie Manor Health Care Center in Torrington. He was 90 years old.
        Mr. Carroll was a lifelong resident of Torrington, in western Connecticut. A former city Treasurer, he held the State Treasurer's post from 1945 to 1946 but was defeated for re-election. He ran successfully for Lieutenant Governor in 1948 as Chester Bowles's running mate but, like Governor Bowles, was defeated in 1950 when the Republicans narrowly reclaimed the Statehouse with John Davis Lodge as chief executive.
        Mr. Carroll lost out for a United States Senate seat in 1952 and for the Governorship in 1954.
        He served as Torrington's Mayor from 1953 to 1957. One night in August 1955 he made a frantic call to Gov. Abraham Ribicoff to report that Torrington, like other areas along the East Coast, was being flooded by heavy rains in the aftermath of Hurricane Diane.
        Mr. Ribicoff called out the National Guard. The early warning gave Connecticut's emergency services a solid head start over other states similarly struck.
        After graduation from Torrington High School, Mr. Carroll went to work for the Brooks Bank and Trust Company in Torrington, where he remained for 25 years. After 1962, he operated a real-estate office in Hartford.
        Mr. Carroll is survived by two sons, William J. of Torrington and James M. of Avon, Conn.; eight grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.
