        Matt Dennis, a singer and songwriter who wrote ''Let's Get Away From It All,'' ''Everything Happens to Me,'' ''Angel Eyes'' and other big-band-era standards, died on June 21 in a hospital in Riverside, Calif. He was 88 and lived in Riverside.
        Though he was an accomplished singer, with a string of albums and appearances on television and in films, it was as a songwriter that Mr. Dennis made his mark. His most popular songs, like ''Angel Eyes,'' have been recorded by singers from Ella Fitzgerald and Nat King Cole to Willie Nelson, and in instrumental versions by Dave Brubeck, Ahmad Jamal and Wynton Marsalis.
        Born Matthew Loveland Dennis to a vaudeville family in Seattle, he learned to play the piano at a young age. In the early 1940's Mr. Dennis worked with Tommy Dorsey as an arranger and vocal coach. He wrote his biggest hits during this time, including ''Will You Still Be Mine?,'' ''Let's Get Away From It All'' and ''Everything Happens to Me.'' The singer was Frank Sinatra, then in Dorsey's employ as well. Mr. Dennis also wrote ''The Night We Called It a Day,'' ''Little Man With a Candy Cigar'' and ''Violets for Your Furs.''
        During World War II he played with Glenn Miller's Army Air Force Band. After the war he worked in radio and television, recorded for several labels and sang in nightclubs with his wife, Virginia Maxey Davis.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by three children, David, of New Orleans; Matthew, of Eureka, Calif.; and Julie, of Riverside; and four grandchildren.
