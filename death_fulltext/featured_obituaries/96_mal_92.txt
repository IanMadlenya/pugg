        S. Michael Higgins, the president of the New Jersey Special Olympics since 1984, died on Sunday at the Hunterdon Medical Center in Flemington, N.J. He was 44 and lived in Ringoes, N.J.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        A native of Eaton Rapids, Mich., Mr. Higgins was a high school English teacher and football coach before joining the Special Olympic movement, which provides athletic opportunities for people with developmental disabilities.
        He is survived by his mother, Harriet; his wife, Candie; two children, Jonathan and Elizabeth; two brothers, Thomas and William, and a sister, Ann.
