        Daniel Sotomayor, whose cartoons about gay political issues were widely published in the homosexual press, died on Feb. 5 at the Illinois Masonic Medical Center in Chicago. He was 33 years old and lived in Chicago.
        A friend, Lori Cannon, said the cause of death was AIDS.
        Cartoons by Mr. Sotomayor appeared weekly across the country in publications for gay readers, including The Windy City Times in Chicago, The Bay Area Reporter in San Francisco, Au Courant in Philadelphia and OutWeek in New York. He was also a leading advocate for AIDS-related services in Chicago.
        Mr. Sotomayor was a graduate of Columbia College and the American Academy of Art, both in Chicago.
        His companion was Scott McPherson, author of "Marvin's Room," now playing Off Broadway in New York. Mr. Sotomayor is survived by his mother, Margaret; two brothers, David and John, and two sisters, Gloria and Grace, all of Chicago.
