        Father Flavian was elected provincial of the Eastern Seaboard region in 1968 and headed it until 1978. He was then elected president of Stauros International, a Passionist-sponsored organization concerned with suffering humanity, with headquarters at the Catholic Theology Union in Chicago.
        He was an advocate for the disabled and wrote several books, including ''The Meaning of Human Suffering'' and ''The Deprived, the Disabled and the Fullness of Life.''
        Father Flavian joined the Passionist order in 1944 and was ordained a priest in 1951.
        He was chaplain and director of several retreats before being named rector in 1962 of St. Joseph's Monastery in Baltimore. He held the post until elected provincial.
        He is survived by a sister, Margaret Nowack of Hatboro, Pa., and a brother, Harry Dougherty of Voorhees, N.J.
