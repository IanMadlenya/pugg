        The cause of death was apparently a heart attack, said his son, Sean, of Manhattan.
        Mr. Cassidy was president of the Decision Research Corporation, a consulting concern he founded in Manhattan in 1967.
        While at St. Patrick's from 1977 to 1984, he produced and directed major events, including the cathdral's 100th anniversary celebration in 1979 and the annual Christmas and St. Patrick's Day celebrations. He also developed community outreach programs for the elderly, the homeless and children.
        Mr. Cassidy, a 1955 graduate of Holy Cross College, was a former president of Arts and Communication in the Human Venture, a nonprofit organization, and the head of the United States Committee for the Bolivar Centennial. He was also president of Prodeo, a Vatican-chartered organization aimed at promoting peace and social justice.
        Besides his son, he is survived by his wife, Emma; two brothers, Francis, of Auburn, Mass., and James, of Manhattan, and a sister, Maureen Rounds of Wilmington, Mass.
