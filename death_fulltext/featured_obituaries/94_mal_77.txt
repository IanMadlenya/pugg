        Dr. Motoo Kimura, a Japanese geneticist who challenged prevailing views about evolution, died on Sunday in a hospital in Shizuoka, Japan, after collapsing in his home, The Associated Press reported. He was 70.
        The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage, The A.P. said.
        Dr. Kimura worked in population genetics and evolution at the molecular level. He developed an alternative to the neo-Darwinian synthesis of evolutionary theory supported by most geneticists, proposing that certain mutations can accumulate in a population without having any selective advantage.
        He was on the staff of the National Institute of Genetics in Japan for many years and served as head of its population genetics department. He wrote several books, including "Neutral Theory of Genetic Evolution" in 1968, and received numerous scientific awards.
        Dr. Kimura was born on Nov. 13, 1924, in Okazaki, Japan. He was educated at Kyoto University and received a Ph.D. at the University of Wisconsin in 1956.
        He is survived by his wife, Hiroko, and a son.
