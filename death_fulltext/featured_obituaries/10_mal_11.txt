        Thomas G. Bergin, a professor emeritus of Yale University who was an authority on Petrarch, Dante and the medieval Provencal poets, died Friday at his home in Madison, Conn. He was 82 years old.
        Professor Bergin was noted particularly for his research on Dante's ''Divine Comedy'' and for its translation. He wrote a popular handbook, ''Dante,'' in 1965, to mark the 700th anniversary of the poet's birth, and was co-author that year of a concordance to ''The Divine Comedy.''
        After his retirement in 1974 he wrote ''Boccaccio'' (1981), an introduction to that author's life and work. Professor Bergin, who received numerous honors for helping to promulgate Italian culture in the United States, also promoted Yale's football team, writing about it in such works as ''The Game: The Harvard-Yale Football Rivalry, 1875-1983'' and in a column for the Yale alumni magazine.
        Known on campus as a witty raconteur, he wrote light verse and was for 15 years the master of Yale's Timothy Dwight College.
        Professor Bergin was born in New Haven and graduated from Yale in 1925, where he received a Ph.D. in 1929. He taught at Cornell University before and after service in World War II, and joined the Yale faculty in 1948, becoming Sterling Professor of Romance Languages in 1957.
        He is survived by his wife, Florence; two daughters, Winifred Hart of Arlington, Va., and Jennifer von Mayrhauser of New York; six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
