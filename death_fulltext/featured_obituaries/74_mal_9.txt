        Kenneth James Stuart, an illustrator and former art director for The Saturday Evening Post and Reader's Digest, died Saturday at Norwalk Hospital. A resident of Wilton, Conn., he was 87.
        His family said the cause was complications following surgery.
        A native of Milwaukee, Mr. Stuart trained at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and l'Academie Colarossi in Paris. He then worked as a freelance cartoonist and an illustrator of advertising displays and magazine covers.
        He became art editor of The Saturday Evening Post in 1943, working closely with the painter Norman Rockwell for the following 18 years.
        Mr. Stuart moved to Reader's Digest as corporate art director in 1962. In that position, he supervised the artwork in all editions.
        Mr. Stuart is survived by three sons, Kenneth Stuart Jr., also of Wilton, Dr. William A. Stuart of Westford, Mass., and Jonathan Stuart of New York City.
