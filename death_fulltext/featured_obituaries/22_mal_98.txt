        Vlad Georgescu, a Rumanian historian who was a leading dissident in his country in the 1970's and who for the last six years directed the Rumanian service of Radio Free Europe, died of a brain tumor on Sunday in Munich, where he lived. He was 51 years old.
        Professor Georgescu was charged with treason and jailed for two months in 1977 and left Rumania in exile two years later. He became a fellow of the Smithsonian Institution's Wilson Center in Washington and taught at the University of Maryland and at Rutgers before returning to Europe, where he was considered a leading spokesman for Rumanians living outside their country.
        Born and educated in Bucharest, he received a doctorate in history from the University of Bucharest in 1970. He was a member of the Institute of Southeastern European Studies in Bucharest for 15 years, and published several scholarly works on 18th- and 19th-century Rumanian history.
        In 1967 and 1968 Mr. Georgescu taught at the University of California at Los Angeles and in 1973 at Columbia. ''Rumanian History,'' a translation of one of his three books published in his native country, will be issued by the Ohio State University Press next year.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Mary Schultz von Strasnitzky, and a son, Tudor.
