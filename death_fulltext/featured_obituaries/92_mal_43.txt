        Vernon Boggs, a sociologist and expert on Afro-Caribbean music and American rhythm-and-blues, died on Sept. 3 at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. He was 55 and lived in New Jersey.
        The cause was acute pneumonia, said a friend, Bill Kornblum.
        Mr. Boggs, who taught social science at York College of the City University of New York, had interests that ranged widely, from the experiences of black servicemen in Sweden during the Vietnam period to the relationship between Afro-Cuban music and early rhythm-and-blues and rock-and-roll.
        He was a regular contributor to Latin Beat, the most informed magazine covering Latin music. His book "Salsiology," which was published in 1992 by Greenwood Press, is considered among the more important books on salsa, covering its origins and Mr. Boggs's relationship to Latin culture. A self-effacing man, Mr. Boggs originally wrote a number of the essays in the book under pseudonyms. He also translated many of the previously unpublished articles of the Cuban musicologist Carlos Ortiz from Spanish to English.
        He is survived by two sons, Vernon W. Boggs Jr. of Pleasantville, N.J., and Dan Rubenstain of Malmo, Sweden, and a daughter, Johanna Cromer of Stockholm.
