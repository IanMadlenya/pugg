        Thomas Lorango, a pianist, died last Wednesday at the New York University Medical Center. He was 33 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of AIDS, said his wife, Karen Ritscher.
        Since his debut at 16 as a soloist with the Philadelphia Orchestra, Mr. Lorango had appeared with many orchestras around the country, including the Dallas Symphony, the St. Louis Symphony and the Buffalo Philharmonic. A frequent recitalist, he appeared at Alice Tully Hall, the Library of Congress and other halls in the United States and in Europe. He was a participant in the Marlboro Music Festival in Vermont and often toured with Music From Marlboro.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by his parents, Vincent and Mary Lorango of North Tonawanda, and a brother, Tony, of Torrance, Calif.
