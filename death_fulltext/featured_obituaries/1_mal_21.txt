        George W. Woodruff, a director of the Coca-Cola Company for 49 years and a major contributor to education and medicine in Georgia, died of pneumonia Wednesday at Emory University Hospital. He was 91 years old.
        Mr. Woodruff's family is famous in American business. With the death of his brother Robert at 95 in 1985, George Woodruff became the last living child of the late Ernest Woodruff, who as president of the Trust Company of Georgia headed a consortium that purchased the Coca-Cola Company in 1919.
        Forbes magazine estimated George Woodruff's wealth at $200 million in 1984.
        He was a director of Coca-Cola from 1936 to 1985 but never was an officer of the company. From 1930 to 1959 he headed the Continental Gin Company, a cotton-processing concern.
        Robert and George Woodruff gave Emory University $105 million in 1979. It was the largest single gift ever to an educational institution, according to the Guinness Book of World Records.
        A native of Atlanta, Mr. Woodruff graduated from Tech High School and attended Georgia Tech and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But his studies were interrupted by World War I and he never returned to college.
        His wife of 64 years, Irene King Woodruff, died in 1982.
        Survivors include three daughters, seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
