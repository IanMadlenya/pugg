        Dora Zaslavsky Koch, a pianist and teacher at the Manhattan School of Music for over half a century, died Monday at her apartment in Manhattan. She was 82 years old.
        Ms. Zaslavsky was born in the Ukraine in 1905 and came to the United States as a child. She began piano studies with Janet Schenck, founder of the Neighborhood Music School, which became the Manhattan School of Music, and was the school's first graduate in 1920.
        Ms. Zaslavsky continued her studies with Wilhelm Backhaus in Philadelphia and Paris, then returned to New York to take up her teaching career at the Manhattan School. Among her students were David Bar-Ilan and Abbey Simon. In 1984, the school awarded her an honorary doctoral degree. She retired two years ago.
        In 1933, Ms. Zaslavsky married John Koch, an artist, who died in 1978. They had no children.
        A memorial service for Ms. Zaslavsky will be held at 3 P.M. today at the John C. Borden Auditorium of the Manhattan School of Music, 130 Claremont Avenue.
