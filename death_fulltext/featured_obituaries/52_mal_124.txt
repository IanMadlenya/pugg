        Myron Brinig, a novelist most noted for early works recalling the settlement and development of Montana, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 94 years old.
        He died of a gastrointestinal hemorrhage, said a family friend, Stephen Morello.
        Mr. Brinig grew up in Butte, Mont., the Silver Bow of his novels, and lovingly and winningly transformed the firsthand accounts of the pioneers and his own insights on the emerging region in "Singermann" (1929), "Wide Open Town" (1931), "This Man Is My Brother" (1932) and "The Sun Sets in the West" (1935).
        The protagonist Singermann was inspired by his father, Maurice Brinig, a Romanian immigrant and shopkeeper.  "Singermann" was reissued in 1975 by Arno Press.  Made Into a Film
        "Wide Open Town" was a flamboyant epic of Butte in the heyday of copper mining and the lusty confluence of frontiersmen, saloons and brothels. Another Brinig best seller was "The Sisters," a 1937 Montana family odyssey transformed into a 1938 movie hit with Bette Davis and Errol Flynn.
        As a young novelist, Mr. Brinig was praised for artistry and inventivenss in narrative, character and incident, but his later works received mix reviews and were sometimes faulted for verbosity and banality. In 1951, The New York Times Book Review said his "sentimental streak and his sympathetic touch with characters usually lend his books a warm glow of humanity, if not of art."
        He was born in Minneapolis on Dec. 22, 1896. When he was 3, the family moved to Butte. He served in the Army in World War I, studied at New York University and at Columbia University and started his career by writing short stories for magazines.
        His score of novels, mostly published by Farrar & Rinehart, include "Madonna Without Child" (1929), "May Flavin" (1938), "Anne Minton's Life" (1939) and finally "The Looking Glass Heart" (1958).
        There are no immediate survivors.
