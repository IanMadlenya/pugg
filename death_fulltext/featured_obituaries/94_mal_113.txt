        Harwood Simmons, a music professor and director of band music at Syracuse University, died on Nov. 14 at Crouse Irving Memorial Hospital in Syracuse. He was 92 and lived in Syracuse.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Alfred Balk, a friend.
        Mr. Simmons was a professor emeritus of music at Syracuse and led its band activities from 1946 to 1968. Before that, he taught at his alma mater, Columbia University, where he also directed the band. He also was in charge of band music at the 1939 New York World's Fair.
        Mr. Simmons played several wind instruments and often appeared in concerts. He conducted the 101st Cavalry Band, the 98th Infantry Division Band and the New York City Symphonic Band, which he led in more than 500 concerts in the metropolitan area.
        No immediate family members survive.
