        Daniel P. Katz, board chairman and chief executive officer of the Kinney System Inc., a nationwide parking company, died of a gunshot wound Wednesday. The police termed his death an apparent suicide. He was 48 years old and lived in Great Neck, L.I.
        The Nassau County police said Mr. Katz was found late Wednesday morning slumped at the wheel of his 1985 Cadillac, which had been parked on a street near his home.
        There was a single chest wound, and a 20-gauge shotgun was found in the car. The police said no note was found.
        Although a police spokesman said they were treating the case as a suicide, the Nassau County Medical Examiner's office said that an official report on the cause and circumstances of the death would not be made for a week to 10 days pending routine tests.
        Mr. Katz, who formerly owned Katz Parking System Inc. in New York City, joined Kinney in 1970. He was a past president and chairman of the National Parking Association, a Washington-based trade group, as well as board chairman of the Metropolitan Garage Owners Associations Inc.
        Mr. Katz, who was active in charitable and religious causes, was appointed by Governor Cuomo last year as a director of the New York Housing Partnership, a nonprofit organization that promotes small housing.
        He was a graduate of St. Luke's School in New Canaan, Conn., and attended the University of Vermont.
        Mr. Katz is survived by his wife, Rosalie; a son, Gary; two daughters, Meredith and Wendy, all of Great Neck; a brother, Edward, and his mother, Rachel Korman, both of Stamford, Conn.
