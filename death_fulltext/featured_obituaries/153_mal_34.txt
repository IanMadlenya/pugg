        Larry Wynn, a lyricist who wrote the words for the 1941 novelty hit ''Five Guys Named Moe,'' died on  Sept. 28 at Englewood Hospital in New Jersey. He was 89 and lived in Cliffside Park, N.J.
        Mr. Wynn's lyrics for ''Five Guys'' were combined with music by Jerry Bresler, and the song was recorded for Decca by Louis Jordan and his Tympany Five.
        Mr. Wynn, a performer and songwriter who later became a salesman in radio and television, once said that six decades ago he had listened to a group of musicians whose names he could not recall, so he referred to them as ''five guys named Moe.'' In a 1992 interview with The Record of Hackensack, N.J., he recalled that he thought at the time: ''Man! That's a title begging for a song.''
        He wrote the song's words quickly. They include these lines: ''There's a brand new band sensation/That is sweeping all the nation/Every hepcat knows them by their name.'' The lyrics also identify the five Moes as Big Moe, Little Moe, Four-Eyed Moe, No Mo' and Eat Mo'. The song's title later became the name for a Broadway revue based on Jordan's song hits.
        Mr. Wynn, originally named Lester Litwin, was reared in Queens and graduated from Washington and Lee University.
        His wife, Evelyn, died in 1990.
