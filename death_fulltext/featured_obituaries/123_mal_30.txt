        Aaron Kramer, a poet and translator, died on Monday at his Long Island home. He was 75.
        Mr. Kramer, a professor emeritus at Dowling College in Oakdale, L.I., was the author of a number of scholarly works including ''Seven Poets in Search of an Answer'' (1944), ''The Poetry and Prose of Heinrich Heine'' (1948), ''The Prophetic Tradition in American Poetry'' (1968) and ''Melville's Poetry: Toward the Enlarged Heart'' (1972).
        He collaborated with a group of artists on ''The Tune of the Calliope: Poems and Drawings of New York'' and was editor of the 1972 anthology ''On Freedom's Side: American Poems of Protest.''
        Mr. Kramer produced translations of ''Rilke: Visions of Christ'' and ''Der Kaiser von Atlantis,'' the opera composed by Viktor Ullmann in the Theresienstadt concentration camp in 1943. His translations of the work of 135 Yiddish poets were published as part of ''A Century of Yiddish Poetry,'' which he also edited.
        Recent collections of Mr. Kramer's own poetry include ''Carousel Parkway,'' ''The Burning Bush'' and ''Indigo and Other Poems.'' He wrote the lyrics for ''Oblomov,'' a play with music, and made recordings for Folkways Records and the Library of Congress. Three books by Mr. Kramer are scheduled for publication  later this year: ''Neglected Aspects of American Poetry,'' a collection of essays; ''Regrouping,'' a selection of new poems, and ''The Last Lullaby: Poems of the Holocaust,'' which he translated and edited.
        He is survived by his wife, Katherine; two daughters, Carol Kramer of Tucson, Ariz., and Laura Kramer of Montclair, N.J.; a sister, Regina Rothman of Los Angeles, and two grandchildren.
