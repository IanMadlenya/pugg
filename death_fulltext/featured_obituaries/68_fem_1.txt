        Marie Paxton, an actress who appeared in many Broadway plays, died on Aug. 16 at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center after a brief illness. She lived in New York City.
        Her family would not give her age or the cause of death.
        Miss Paxton was born in London, the daughter of the English actor Sydney Paxton and a descendant of five generations of actors. She began acting as a child, and first appeared in the United States in "Pickwick" in 1927 and "Napoleon" in 1928.
        Miss Paxton moved to New York in the early 1940's and appeared in such Broadway productions as "The Three Sisters" with Katharine Cornell and Judith Anderson, "The Chalk Garden" with Gladys Cooper, "O Mistress Mine" with Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, and "Hadrian VII" with Alec McCowan.
        Her last appearance on Broadway was as Lady Brockhurst in the 1970 revival of "The Boy Friend" with Sandy Duncan. Miss Paxton was Mrs. Higgins in the first national company of "My Fair Lady," and played that role more than 3,000 times in various productions.
        She is survived by a niece, Patricia Paxton Jordan, of London.
