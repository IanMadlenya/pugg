        Henri Cochet, one of the famed Four Musketeers of French tennis, died Wednesday night after a long illness. He was 85 years old.
        Cochet, son of a groundskeeper at a Lyon tennis club, helped lift France into world tennis dominance from the mid-1920's through the early 1930's. He won eight major singles championships - five French Opens, two Wimbledons, and one United States championship. He also won two Wimbledon and three French doubles titles with Jacques Brugnon and was a winner in 44 of 58 Davis Cup matches.
        As a team, he, Brugnon and the other two musketeers, Rene LaCoste and Jacques Borotra, won the Wimbledon singles championships between 1924 and 1929, setting up an all-French final in five of the six years. Cochet was singles champion in 1927 and 1929.
        The French foursome won the Davis Cup from the United States in 1927 and defended it for the next five years.
        Tennis was Cochet's whole life and he was never far from the courts. He operated a Paris sporting goods store and was giving tennis lessons well into his 70's.
