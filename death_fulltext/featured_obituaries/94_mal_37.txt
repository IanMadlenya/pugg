        Archie San Romani, a Kansas coal miner's son who overcame a severe childhood accident to become one of the world's leading milers in the 1930's, died Monday at a nursing home in Auberry, Calif. He was 82 and a resident of Fresno, Calif.
        The cause of death was a heart attack, his family said.
        Two of the nation's fastest men in the 1930's were born in Kansas within two years of each other. One, Glenn Cunningham, was widely regarded as the dominant miler of his day, but in 28 races in which he and Mr. San Romani, a native of Frontenac, faced each other, the record shows a dead heat, with each finishing ahead of the other 14 times.
        Mr. San Romani, whose right leg was so mangled when he was run over by a truck at the age of 8 that doctors initially thought amputation was the only way to save his life, began running as rehabilitation.
        He won admission to Kansas State Teachers College in Emporia by promising the track coach he would make the 1936 Olympic team. By the time he graduated, he had broken a series of world relay and collegiate mile and 1,500-meter records.
        He also made the 1936 Olympic team and placed fourth in the 1,500, behind John Lovelock, Cunningham and Luigi Beccali, then, in a match race, became the only man to beat Mr. Lovelock.
        Mr. San Romani later taught music in the Anaheim, Calif., school system.
        Survivors include his wife, Lena, a son, 4 daughters, 14 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren.
