        Andre Gaillard, a former chef of La Reserve, a French restaurant at 4 West 49th Street, died of a gunshot wound on Tuesday at his home in Creskill, N.J. He was 37 years old.
        Associates said Mr. Gaillard was cleaning his hunting rifle when it discharged accidentally, hitting an artery in his shoulder. The Creskill police said he was pronounced dead at Englewood Hospital.
        Mr. Gaillard had been chef at La Reserve for almost five years when he left on Jan. 19, said Jean Louis Missud, the owner of the restaurant. ''He wanted to take a partnership at Le Chantilly,'' Mr. Missud said.  Camille Dulac, owner of Le Chantilly, confirmed that he had been negotiating with Mr. Gaillard but said that no final agreement had been reached.
        Mr. Gaillard had worked as a sous chef at La Cote Basque from March 1984 to March 1985. Earlier, he had been a chef at Perigord Park, now Huberts Restaurant, for three years, and from 1979 to 1981 he had also worked at Le Cirque as a sous chef, Mr. Dulac said.
        Mr. Gaillard was born in Digoin, France, and had studied cooking in his native Burgundy before coming to the United States in the 1970's.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Maria Martinuz and two daughters, Stephanie and Fabienne, both of Creskill.
