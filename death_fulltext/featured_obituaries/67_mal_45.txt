        Brian F. Hayes, a Dartmouth student who wrote an article for The New York Times Magazine in 1991 about his experiences as a cancer patient, died Sunday in his parents' home in Melrose, Mass. He was 24 years old.
        The cause of death was testicular cancer, said his father, G. Frederick Hayes.
        Mr. Hayes, whose studies at Dartmouth College were repeatedly interrupted by his illness, planned to return there this fall to finish his senior year.
        In the article, Mr. Hayes wrote that at one point, when he returned to college after cancer treatments: "On the surface, I had fully recovered; the rosy tint had returned to my cheeks and my hair was rapidly filling in. Inside, however, I was falling apart."
        "During treatment, I was always surrounded by people who knew what I was going through," he went on. "At school, I was alone with my disease, and aware that another relapse would likely kill me. At weekend parties, I joined my friends as they gyrated to deafening music, but I would find myself wondering, 'How can I celebrate and act as if everything is O.K. when I don't even know if I will live long enough to graduate?' "
        Mr. Hayes grew up in Melrose and entered Dartmouth in 1986. Tig Tillinghast, the editor of the college newspaper, The Dartmouth, said Mr. Hayes had written about 100 articles for the paper -- most of them after he learned he had cancer -- and often carried a police radio to keep up with police news.
        In addition to his father, Mr. Hayes is survived by his mother, Shirley, and a sister, Cheryl A. Hayes, who lives in the family home.
