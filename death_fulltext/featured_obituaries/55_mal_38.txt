        John Field, a former artistic director of the Sadler's Wells Theater Ballet who was long associated with the Royal Ballet, died Saturday. He was 69 years old.
        The Times of London reported that he had had cancer.
        Born in Doncaster in northern England, Mr. Field studied dancing in Liverpool and made his first appearances at the age of 17 with the Liverpool Ballet Club. At 18 he joined the Sadler's Wells Ballet in London, taking part in its first wartime tour before joining the Royal Air Force in 1942. After the war, he rejoined Sadler's Wells and became one of its principal dancers, partnering Margot Fonteyn and Beryl Grey.
        In 1956, he was appointed artistic director of the Sadler's Wells Theater Ballet, the second company of the Sadler's Wells. Months later the senior company became the Royal Ballet, with Mr. Field as assistant director.
        When the Royal Ballet's director, Sir Frederick Ashton, retired in 1970, Mr. Field was named co-director with Kenneth MacMillan. But Mr. Field left within a year.
        From 1971 to 1974 he was ballet director at La Scala in Milan. He then became artistic director of the Royal Academy of Dancing and of the London Festival Ballet. In 1984, he became artistic director of the British Ballet Organization.
        Mr. Field was named Commander of the British Empire in 1967.
        He is survived by his wife, the former dancer Anne Heaton.
