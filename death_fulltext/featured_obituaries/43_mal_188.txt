        Mr. Beaulac's diplomatic career spanned more than 40 years. He joined the Foreign Service in 1921 as a vice consul and for more than 10 years held consular posts in Central and South America.
        In 1939, Mr. Beaulac was adviser to the United States delegation to the second American International Labor Organization. He was named counselor to the United States Embassy in Cuba in 1940 and in the next year was assigned to a similar role in in Spain.

        After his retirement, Mr. Beaulac taught political science at Southern Illinois and Ball State Universities, lecturing on South American affairs until the late 1960's.
        Mr. Beaulac was the author of several books, including ''Career Ambassador'' (1951; Macmillan), about which Herbert L. Matthews wrote, ''It is a human, pleasant, entertaining book about a man who never lost his sense of humor or his kindly feelings toward his associates.''
        Mr. Beaulac was born in Pawtucket, R.I., and attended Brown University before joining the Navy in 1918. After his discharge in 1919, he graduated from the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University.
