        Mr. Shaw, the National Collegiate Athletic Association triple-jump champion of 1952, competed in that event at the 1952 and 1956 Olympic Games, but failed to win a medal. He set the Columbia marks for the triple jump, 50 feet 5 1/2 inches, and the indoor long jump, 24-2 3/4, in 1952.
        After his graduation in 1953, he was an executive in advertising sales and marketing. Mr. Shaw, who was divorced, is survived by his former wife, Alicia; four children: George Jr., Duane, Sharon and Stacey, and five grandchildren.
