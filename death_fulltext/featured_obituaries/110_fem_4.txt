        Dorothy Porter, a Ziegfeld girl and the first woman to be a mayor in Nevada,  died on Feb. 24 at a rehabilitation center. She was 89.
        Ms. Porter held office in North Las Vegas from 1953 to 1956.
        She was 15 when the producer Florenz Ziegfeld asked her to join the Ziegfeld Follies in 1922. It was at that time that she became known nationally as the Palmolive Girl, with her face on billboards advertising the soap. She danced onstage with Will Rogers, Eddie Cantor, George Jessel, Al Jolson and others in the 1920's.
        She is survived by a sister, Emma Richardson of Houston.
