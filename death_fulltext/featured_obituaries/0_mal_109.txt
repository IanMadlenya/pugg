        Mr. Sargent, who was born in Wareham, Mass., was a tutor at Harvard University from 1914 to 1934, with time out to drive an ambulance in France during World War I. He left the university when his book, ''Thomas More,'' a biography of the 16th-century English saint, was published.
        From 1934 to 1946, Mr. Sargent wrote 10 other books before turning full-time to writing poetry.
        He is survived by a son, Daniel I., of North Salem, N.Y., and six grandhildren.
