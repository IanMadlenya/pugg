        David Lachenbruch, a writer and editor who was a respected voice in the world of consumer electronics for four decades, died on Nov. 3 at his home in Manhattan. He was 75.
        The cause was complications from asthma, according to a spokesman at Warren Publishing, where Mr. Lachenbruch was the editorial director.
        Mr. Lachenbruch, who worked for 45 years at Warren, primarily at the trade journal Television Digest, was one of the most frequently quoted experts in the consumer electronics field and wrote many articles on the subject. He could speak extemporaneously on anything from television history to the vagaries of the digital code transmission of programming.
        During his career, Mr. Lachenbruch wrote about major developments in the television industry, including the consolidation of American television set manufacturers, trade issues in Asia and the growth of home satellite television.
        Mr. Lachenbruch was born in New Rochelle, N.Y., and graduated from the University of Michigan in 1942. After serving in the Army in Asia during World War II, he worked at a newspaper in York, Pa. He spent the rest of his career at Warren as a writer and editor for Television Digest.
        He is survived by his daughter, Ann Zulawski of Brooklyn, and two brothers, Arthur and Simon.
