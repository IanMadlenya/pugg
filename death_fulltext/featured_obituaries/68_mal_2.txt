        George A. Roeper, an educator and founder of the Roeper City and Country School in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., died Aug. 24 in Oakland, Calif. He was 81 and lived in Oakland.
        Mr. Roeper died of pneumonia, said Loiro Zinser, a spokesman for the school.
        An authority on the education of gifted children, Mr. Roeper and his wife, Annemarie, founded the school in 1941, soon after they fled to the United States from their native Germany. The couple, who had met when Mr. Roeper was a student at a secondary school operated by Mrs. Roeper's parents, sought students of diverse ethnic and economic backgrounds. The school, which was begun as a lower school, began offering a high school program in the mid-1960's. Mr. Roeper retired as head of the lower school in 1979 and Mrs. Roeper as head of the high school in 1980.
        Mr. Roeper was active with Amnesty International and was an early member of the Comparative Educational Society, which examines the education in other countries.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Thomas, of Amherst, Mass., and Peter, of Oakland; a daughter, Karen, of Oakland, and three grandchildren.
