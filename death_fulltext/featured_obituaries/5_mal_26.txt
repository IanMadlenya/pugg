        Mr. Sampson died at Methodist Hospital, with his former wife, Jill, and son, Tim, at his bedside, according to a hospital spokeswoman, Brenda Blake.
        Mr. Sampson, a Creek Indian, was best known as an actor for his portrayal of Jack Nicholson's mute friend in the film version of Ken Kesey's novel.
        Besides ''Cuckoo's Nest'' in 1975, he appeared in ''The White Buffalo'' in 1977, ''Orca'' in 1977 and ''Alcatraz: The Whole Shocking Story'' in 1978. More recently, he appeared as the demon-battling Indian in ''Poltergeist II: The Other Side.''
        Mr. Sampson, who lapsed into a coma 10 days ago, died of kidney failure and ''a combination of problems,'' according to Ms. Blake.
        His body was to be returned for burial in his childhood hometown of Okmulgee, Okla., Ms. Blake said.
