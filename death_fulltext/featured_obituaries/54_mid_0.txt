        Martha Pulliam, a former newspaper publisher and the grandmother of Vice President Dan Quayle, died today. She was 100 years old.
        Mrs. Pulliam died at the Methodist Retirement Home Hospital here, said Owen Hansen, managing editor of The Lebanon Reporter in Lebanon, where Mrs. Pulliam was publisher emeritus.
        "My grandmother was the matriarch of our family," the Vice President said today. "She lived a long and beautiful life."
        In 1919, she married Eugene C. Pulliam, who founded Central Newspapers Inc., which publishes newspapers in Indianapolis, Muncie and Vincennes, Ind., and in Phoenix. The couple divorced in 1941.
        She was the stepmother of Eugene S. Pulliam, currently publisher of The Indianapolis Star and The Indianapolis News. Mrs. Pulliam was publisher of The Lebanon Reporter from the early 1940's until last December.
        In his debate in October 1988 with Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee, Mr. Quayle cited his grandmother as someone who had been an inspiration in his early life.
        He was asked how his experience had shaped his political philosophy, and Mr. Quayle replied that his maternal grandmother said, " 'You can do anything you want to if you just set your mind to it and go to work.' "
        The day of the election that year, Mr. Quayle visited Mrs. Pulliam at her nursing home. He said later, "She said to keep going in the right direction, but don't do anything you shouldn't do."
        Mrs. Pulliam was born March 23, 1891, in Franklin, a daugher of Lyman Edward and Martha Payne Ott. She was a graduate of Franklin College.
        Gov. Evan Bayh presented Mrs. Pulliam with a Sagamore of the Wabash, the state's highest civilian honor, on her 100th birthday this year.
        Other survivors include 2 daughters, Martha Corrinne Quayle of Huntington, Ind., and Suzanne Murphy of Potomac, Md.; 10 grandchildren, and 23 great-grandchildren.
