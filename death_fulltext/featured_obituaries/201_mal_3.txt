        Bernard H. Kamenske, former chief of the Voice of America's news operation, died on Sept. 25 in Bethesda, Md. He was 75 and lived in Bethesda.
        The cause was heart and lung disease, said Alan L. Heil Jr., a former colleague.
        Mr. Kamenske became chief of the news operation in 1973. In 1981 when he resigned in the face of Reagan administration proposals to make the Voice of America a more partisan supporter of United States policies.
        The news service operates separately from the Voice of America's commentary arm. Mr. Kamenske was widely credited with seeing that the news operation obtained a Congressional charter in 1976 guaranteeing its accuracy and objectivity.
        During the Reagan administration, tensions arose when a new appointee in the Voice of America's parent agency wrote that the organization should function as a ''propaganda agency.''
        A New York Times editorial described Mr. Kamenske's resignation as ''loyally discreet,'' but it focused attention on the Reagan administration's shift in approach. Afterward, ''in the news division there was pretty much a backing off'' of pressure by the administration, said Mr. Heil, who has written a history of the Voice of America.
        Mr. Kamenske began his career at the Voice of America in 1955 as a news writer, rising steadily through the ranks to the news operation's top position.
        Bernard Harold Kamenske was born on Oct. 11, 1927, in Nashua, N.H., and attended private schools in Boston, where he joined The Associated Press in 1944 as a writer and editor. After leaving the Voice of America, he worked for two years for CNN as a senior news editor in Washington.
        He is survived by his wife of 43 years, Gloria Cheek Kamenske, and a sister, Jeannette Ruderman of Hollywood, Fla.
