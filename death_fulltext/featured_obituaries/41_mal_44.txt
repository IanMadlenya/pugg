        Stiv Bators, the lead singer for the early punk band the Dead Boys, died Monday in Paris after being hit by a car. He was 40 years old.
        Mr. Bators formed the Dead Boys in Cleveland in 1976, and when they moved to New York they became part of the first wave of punk bands, centered at the club CBGB. With the club's owner, Hilly Kristal, as their manager, the Dead Boys made two albums -''Young, Loud and Snotty'' in 1977 and ''We Have Come for Your Children'' in 1978. Then they dissolved.
        In 1982 Mr. Bators formed the Lords of the New Church with Brian James, who had been a member of the early British punk band the Damned. They released four albums from 1982 to 1986. After the final one, ''Killer Lords,'' Mr. Bators moved to Paris.
        Mr. Bators appeared in two films, Michael Nesmith's ''Tapeheads'' and John Waters's ''Polyester.'' He had recently formed a new band, the New Lords of the New Church.
        He is survived by his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Steven J. Bator Sr. of Cleveland.
