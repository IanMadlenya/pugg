        Grzegorz Bialkowski, rector of Warsaw University and a successful Solidarity-backed candidate for the new upper house of Parliament, died on Thursday of a heart attack. He was 56 years old.
        Mr. Bialkowski, a physicist and poet, studied at Warsaw University and spent his entire working career there.
        Active in opposition causes despite his position as the top academic official at the state-run institution, he maintained good relations with the banned pro-Solidarity Independent Students Association and offered the university for such events as an Independent Culture Forum last spring.
        On June 4, Mr. Bialkowski was elected to Poland's new Senate, representing the central province of Piotrkow. He never was sworn in as a senator, since the new chamber does not convene until next week.
