        Dr. Jones was a special assistant in foreign aid programs at the State Department after World War II. Earlier, he had been an economist with the United States Tariff Commission.
        He was the author of five books, including ''Fifteen Weeks,'' an account of the formation of the Marshall Plan that played a central role in the economic recovery of Western Europe, and ''Tariff Retaliation,'' which dealt with repercussions in world trade from the Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act of 1930.
        Dr. Jones, a native of Lockhart, Tex., received a bachelor's degree from Baylor University and master's and doctoral degrees from the University of Pennsylvania. He was an associate editor of Fortune magazine from 1943 to 1946.
        After leaving the State Department in 1953, Dr. Jones was a research fellow at Yale University, a special assistant to Gov. W. Averell Harriman of New York from 1955 to 1959 and a consultant to the Lasker Foundation.
        He retired to Florida in 1967 and lectured at the University of Miami until 1978, when he returned to the Washington area.
        Dr. Jones is survived by his second wife, the former Lillian Grosvenor Coville and, from his first marriage to the former Sarah Harrison, a daughter, Clarissa Parker of Washington; a son, Clergue Jones of Arlington, and three grandchildren.
