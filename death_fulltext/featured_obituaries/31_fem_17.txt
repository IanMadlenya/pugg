        Helen Hadassah Lyons, a pioneer in Jewish education for women, died of a brain tumor on Sunday in New Rochelle (N.Y.) Hospital. She was 79 years old and lived in New Rochelle.
        In 1939, Mrs. Lyons became the first woman in the United States to complete the full curriculum at a recognized rabbinical college, the Reform movement's Jewish Institute of Religion. But the title rabbi was not conferred on her because women were not ordained at the time.
        Though she lacked the title, Mrs. Lyons lectured and preached widely and became an advocate for women's ordination. Women were first ordained as rabbis in the 1970's.
        Last year, the seminary from which she graduated, since renamed the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, honored Mrs. Lyons for her scholarship. ''You are blessed,'' the citation said, ''that in your lifetime, you are able to see others travel the path that you had cleared.''
        She is survived by her husband, Lester; a daughter, Judith Aviva Lyons of New Rochelle; a son, George David Lyons of West Harrison, Ind., and one granddaughter.
