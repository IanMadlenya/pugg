        Dr. Robert M. Heyssel, a former president of the Johns Hopkins Hospital who oversaw a major expansion there and worked to improve the delivery of health services, especially to the poor, died on Wednesday in Seaford, Del., where he lived. He was 72.
        The cause was lung cancer, Elaine Freeman, a spokeswoman for Johns Hopkins, said.
        Dr. Heyssel was a key member of a Johns Hopkins group that came up with the idea of starting the first health maintenance organization for East Baltimore, a poor area near the hospital that has been revitalized. He had a reputation for fighting soaring health costs and government and industry control over medical care. He published dozens of papers on those issues and worked for affordable housing in the neighborhood.
        In 1968, Dr. Heyssel began his career at Johns Hopkins, and he helped found the Columbia Medical Plan and the East Baltimore Medical Plan in the 1970's. The two were among the earliest health plans in the region. He also helped set up the East Baltimore plan's successor, the Johns Hopkins Health Plan under the Johns Hopkins Health System, in 1986.
        Dr. Heyssel became the hospital's president in 1982. By the time he retired in 1992, he had spent 24 years at Johns Hopkins and had overseen the redevelopment and a major expansion of the hospital.
        He was born in Jamestown, Mo., on June 20, 1928, earned his bachelor's degree from the University of Missouri and graduated from the Saint Louis University School of Medicine in 1953.
        Dr. Heyssel is survived by his wife, Maria; a sister, Mary Bumgarner of Columbia, Mo.; three sons, James, of Cooksville, Md., Robert Jr., of Huntington, N.Y., and Kurt, of Lutherville, Md.; two daughters, Lisa Heyssel Flexner of Ellicott City, Md., and Peri Glaser of Wiener Neustadt, Austria; and nine grandchildren.
