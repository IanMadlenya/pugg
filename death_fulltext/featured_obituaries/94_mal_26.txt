        Owen Harvey Nichols, the founding chairman of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, died on Tuesday at his home in Golf, Fla. He was 68.
        The cause was heart failure, said his wife, Carol.
        Mr. Nichols was born in Market Harborough, England, and came to the United States in 1948. In 1961, he joined Mitchell, Hutchins Inc., now a subsidiary of Paine Webber, as a commodities broker.
        He remained with Paine Webber until 1991, when he retired from the firm as a senior vice president in the futures department.
        He was elected as the chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade in 1971 and served for two years. He was the founding chairman of the Chicago Board Options Exchange in 1973 and remained in that position for one year.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Stuart, of Mendham, N.J., and two grandchildren.
