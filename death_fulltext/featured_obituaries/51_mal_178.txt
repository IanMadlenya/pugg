        Mr. Weiffenbach was a 1934 graduate of the College of Engineering at the University of Michigan.
        He is survived by his wife, Florence; two daughters, Jean-Edith Weiffenbach of San Francisco and Cynthia Edwards of Key West, Fla., and two sons, Conrad of Madison, Wisc., and Eric of Branford, Conn.
