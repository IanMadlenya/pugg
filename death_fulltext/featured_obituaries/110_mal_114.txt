        Howard Pyle Wyeth, a rock drummer and jazz pianist best known for working with Bob Dylan in the mid-1970's, died on Wednesday night at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 51 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was reported to be cardiac arrest.
        Mr. Wyeth, the grandson of the artist N. C. Wyeth and the nephew of Andrew Wyeth, was born in 1944. He studied percussion with Alan Abel of the Philadelphia Orchestra and graduated with a bachelor's degree in music from Syracuse University in 1966. He moved to New York City in 1969.
        Mr. Wyeth toured in 1975 and 1976 with Bob Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue, an  informal, constantly changing all-star tour that included Joan Baez, Joni Mitchell and others; the tour was also filmed for themovie "Renaldo and Clara."
        Mr. Wyeth played drums on two albums with Mr. Dylan, "Desire" and "Hard Rain"; he also performed on four albums by the rockabilly revivalist Robert Gordon, and on albums by Roger McGuinn, Don McLean, Leslie West, Kinky Friedman, James Moody and others. More recently, Mr. Wyeth concentrated on piano, leading  his own groups in ragtime, blues and early jazz at New York clubs.
        He is survived by his companion of 17 years, Catherine Wheeler, and by four brothers, John and David of Manhattan, N. Convers of Oakton, Va., and Andrew N.  of Willimantic, Conn.
