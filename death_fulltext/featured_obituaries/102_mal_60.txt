        Earl Coleman, a jazz singer who recorded with Charlie Parker, Sonny Rollins and Shirley Scott among others, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 69.
        He suffered cardiac arrest, said Mike Abene, a pianist who often accompanied him. He did not give further details.
        A deep-voiced performer of ballads, Mr. Coleman was a product of the graceful early forms of jazz singing. He had absorbed Pha Terrell, Dan Grissom and Billy Eckstine, and their heavy, sophisticated ease. Though Mr. Coleman was mostly a ballad singer, he also performed uptempo material and blues pieces. And while his style was linked to an earlier era, he recorded and performed with members of the be-bop generation.
        He began his career in the 1940's and in 1947 he made his first recordings, "This is Always" and "Dark Shadows" with Charlie Parker. The same year he recorded with the saxophonist Gene Ammons, and a year later with the trumpeter Howard McGhee.
        Mr. Coleman made his first recordings under his own name in 1948, for Savoy and Atlantic Records, but for the rest of his career recorded and performed only sporadically. He appeared on Mr. Rollins's "Tour de Force" and recorded with Ms. Scott, the organist, and the pianist Elmo Hope. During the 1960's he recorded occasionally for Atlantic Records and other labels. And in 1984 he recorded again under his own name for Slash Records.
        He is survived by his wife, Candee.

        An obituary on July 14 about Earl Coleman, a jazz singer, misidentified a company for which he recorded. It was Stash Records, not Slash Records.
