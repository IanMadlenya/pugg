        John H. Wallace, a chemical company executive and former director of the James Forrestal Research Center at Princeton University, died Wednesday at his home in Princeton after a long illness. He was 82 years old.
        Dr. Wallace, who was born in Greenville, Ky., earned bachelor's and doctorate degrees at Princeton. In 1934 he bought a laboratory where he had been a consulting chemist, and it became Wallace Laboratories.
        That organization merged with Carter Products to become Carter-Wallace Inc., a drug and cosmetics manufacturer based in Manhattan. Dr. Wallace developed Arrid deodorant for Carter-Wallace in the 1930's.
        He left the company in 1951 to join the Forrestal Research Center and retired as its director in 1969.
        Dr. Wallace was also a former president of Princeton Hospital, now the Princeton Medical Center.
        Surviving are his wife, Margaret; two sons, John, of Princeton, and William, of Short Hills, N.J., and six grandchildren.
