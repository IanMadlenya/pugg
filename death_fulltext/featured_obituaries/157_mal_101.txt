        Ronald Bruce Casey, a progressive voice in Alabama journalism as the Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial-page editor of The Birmingham News, died on Monday in Birmingham. He was 48 and lived in Homewood, Ala.
        The cause was a heart attack, The News said.
        Mr. Casey's writing focused on issues like improving Alabama's school system and updating the state Constitution. He won a Pulitzer Prize in 1991 with Joey Kennedy and Harold Jackson for editorials exposing injustice in the tax system.
        Mr. Casey, a graduate of the University of Alabama, joined The News as a reporter in 1973. He was named editor of the editorial page in 1990.
        Mr. Casey is survived by his wife of 21 years, Margaret Griffin Brooke; two children, Jefferson and Anna; four brothers, Ben, of Alabaster, Ala., Bob, of Gulf Breeze, Fla., and Billy and Buddy, both of Hueytown, Ala.; and a sister, Nancy Ray of Helena, Ala.
