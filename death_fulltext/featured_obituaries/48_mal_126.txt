        Gordon I. Newcombe, former headmaster of the Horace Mann School, a coeducational preparatory school in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, died on Monday at Lawrence Hospital in the Bronx. He was 67 years old and lived in Yonkers.
        He died of cancer, a spokeswoman for the family said.
        Mr. Newcombe was appointed headmaster at Horace Mann in 1986, after being provost, head of the history department and dean of faculty. He retired last year.
        Earlier he was headmaster of the Barnard School for Boys, which merged with Horace Mann in 1973. He also taught a course in political philosophy.
        Mr. Newcombe was a member of the review committee of the New York State Board of Regents, of the Middle States Evaluation Committee and the Evaluation Committee of the New York State Association of Independent Schools. He was co-founder and chairman of the Independent Schools Admissions Association of Greater New York.
        He was born in Cardiff, Wales, and came to the United States as a child. He graduated from Kenyon College and received a master's degree from Harvard University.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Virginia McCartney; two sons, David, of Cambridge, England, and Andrew, of Riverdale; two daughters, Sarah Sullo of Port Chester, N.Y., and Martha, of Falls Church, Va., and six grandchildren.
