        John G. Malino, an executive with the Loews Corporation in New York who oversaw all its real estate activities, died Sunday at a hospital in Manhattan. He was 60.
        He died of complications from heart surgery performed last month, said Candace Leeds, a spokeswoman for Loews.
        Mr. Malino, who lived in Woodmere, N.Y., worked at Loews for 35 years, starting in the real estate department of Loews Theaters in 1964.
        He was named vice president of real estate for the entire corporation in 1982.
        In April 1994, Mr. Malino was honored by the Real Estate Board of New York for ''the most ingenious deal of the year'' -- securing the Ed Sullivan Theater in Manhattan for the ''Late Night With David Letterman'' show on CBS.
        Mr. Malino had worked with CBS real estate executives to help relocate the show and to buy and renovate the theater, at 1697 Broadway and 53rd Street, and some adjoining office buildings.
        John Gray Malino was born on Oct. 15, 1939, in Brooklyn and graduated from New York University.
        He is survived by his wife, Phyllis; four daughters, Joanne Ruggiero, Debbie Ackerman, Linda Malino and Dana Rich, all of Manhattan, and two grandsons.
