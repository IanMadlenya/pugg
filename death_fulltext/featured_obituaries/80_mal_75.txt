        Varindra Tarzie Vittachi, a retired executive of Unicef, died yesterday at the home of his daughter, Anuradha Armstrong, in Oxfordshire, England. He was 69.
        She said the cause was cancer.
        Mr. Vittachi was a retired deputy executive director of the United Nations Children's Fund. He served in a variety of United Nations positions for more than two decades.
        In the 1970's, he was director of information of the United Nations Population Fund. He joined the Children's Fund in 1980 and served there until he retired in 1988. In recent years, he was a lecturer and wrote extensively about poverty in underdeveloped countries.
        Born in Ceylon, now Sri Lanka, and educated there at the university in Colombo, he became an editor of The Ceylon Observer. He wrote a book about the Government's involvement in the country's race riots that won him the Magasaysay Prize in 1959 and led to his being declared persona non grata.
        From 1960 to 1965 he was Asian director of the International Press Institute, an organization of editors devoted to promoting the freedom of the press. He was, at the same time, a correspondent for The Economist, the BBC and The Sunday Times of London and wrote a column for Newsweek.
        A book about the role of the Children's Fund in arranging truces to protect children in time of conflict, called "Between the Guns," will be published posthumously.
        Besides his daughter, he is survived by his wife, Sarojini, and four sons by previous marriages: Roosman of New York City, Nury of Hong Kong, Adil of London and Imran of Paris.
