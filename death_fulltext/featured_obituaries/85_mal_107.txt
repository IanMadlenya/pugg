        R. Eugene Curry, a real-estate developer and civic leader concerned with problems of the aging, died on Sunday at Greenwich Hospital in Greenwich, Conn. He was 93 and lived in Armonk, N.Y.
        Mr. Curry, a graduate of the Harvard School of Business Administration, made a career as a real-estate developer in Westchester County before World War II. During the war he served with the United States Navy, ending as a lieutenant commander and deputy chief of the naval base at Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands.
        In more recent decades he devoted his time to civic affairs and the aging of Westchester. He served as a member of advisory committees, administrator of the Osborn Memorial Home in Rye, now the Osborn Retirement Center, and chairman of the Westchester Citizens Committee on the Aging and the Chronically Ill. He helped organize the White House Conferences on Aging in 1961 and 1971 and served on the New York State Health and Hospital Review Committee.
        Mr. Curry is survived by his wife, Margery Metheny Curry; two daughters, Margaret C. Gregg of Bethesda, Md., and Manhattan, and Janet C. Harrison of Williamsport, Pa.; two sons, Dr. Renwick E. of Atlanta and John P. of Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and 14 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.
