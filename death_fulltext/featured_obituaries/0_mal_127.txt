        Charles Fredrick Wolcott, a music composer and arranger who worked with Walt Disney Studios and is credited with bringing rock-and-roll to the screen, died Wednesday. He was 80 years old.
        Mr. Wolcott was born in Flint, Mich. In 1927, he joined the Jean Goldkette band, playing piano and scoring music for Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey. He became an arranger for Paul Whiteman, Benny Goodman and the Dorsey brothers. Mr. Wolcott also arranged music for radio stars Rudy Vallee, George Burns and Gracie Allen.
        He joined Walt Disney in 1934 and during his 10 years there wrote songs for or arranged film scores of ''The Reluctant Dragon,'' ''Bambi,'' ''Saludos Amigos,'' ''The Three Caballeros,'' ''Song of the South,'' ''Make Mine Music!'' and ''Fun and Fancy Free.''
        He went to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1950 and is credited with bringing rock-and-roll to the motion picture screen, prevailing on the producer of the film ''The Blackboard Jungle'' to incorporate Bill Haley's recording of ''Rock Around the Clock'' into the film. Mr. Walcott also scored that 1955 movie.
        Mr. Wolcott left Hollywood in 1960 to devote time to the Baha'i faith.
        He is survived by his wife, Harriett, two daughters and several grandchildren.
