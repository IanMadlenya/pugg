        Angelo Pinto, a painter who taught for nearly six decades at the Barnes Foundation in Merion, Pa., died on March 11. He was 85.
        The cause was a stroke, said his daughter, Jody Pinto.
        One of five brothers, born in Cas'Avellino, Italy, he grew up in Philadelphia, the son of a fruit and vegetable vendor, and with two of his brothers, Salvatore and Biagio, began to study art with Dr. Albert C. Barnes in the late 1920's. Barnes took the brothers under his wing and went with them to Italy and France, where they visited Matisse in his studio. It was Matisse who suggested they paint in North Africa. Barnes supported that trip, and on the way they were mistakenly arrested as spies in Corsica. Matisse vouched for them and they were released.
        Mr. Pinto and his brothers opened a photography studio in New York City in the 1930's and did color photography for Life and Look magazines. They also designed stage sets for ballet companies. Barnes invited Mr. Pinto to teach at his foundation in 1934. Mr. Pinto's own works, abstracted Surrealistic images, included reverse paintings on glass in which the lowest, first layer of pigment is the one seen through the glass and the later layers become the backdrop. Barnes bought five of these for his collection.
        Mr. Pinto is survived by his wife, Gertrude, of Manhattan; three daughters, a son and two grandchildren.
