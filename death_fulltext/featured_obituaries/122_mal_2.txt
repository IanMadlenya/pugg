        Paul Otto Heyer, a professor and former president of the New York School of Interior Design, died on Feb. 22 at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 60 and lived on the Upper West Side, where he also had an architectural office.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Professor Heyer served as the design school's president from 1989 until mid-1996 when he assumed the Chair of Architecture and Design. This fall the school will introduce a Master of Fine Arts Program developed by Professor Heyer.
        During his tenure as president he also directed the college's move in 1994 into its own home at 170 East 70th Street, a four-story, 95-year-old Beaux Arts structure in the Upper East Side Historic District. The new quarters, originally built as a carriage house, roughly doubled the space the school had occupied on East 56th Street, enough to add a 3,000-square-foot atelier studio and an auditorium seating 150.
        Professor Heyer first established himself as an administrator at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, where he served as a professor of architecture from 1968 until 1989. He was named co-chairman of its graduate architectural studies in 1979 and in the 1980's was the dean of the School of Architecture until he joined the New York School of Interior Design.
        He was the author of ''Architects on Architecture: New Directions in America'' (Walker, 1966), followed by an updated edition in 1977, which was reissued in 1994. In it he documented the work of some 40 leading architects of the time, along with their guiding principles.
        Born in Brighton, England, he graduated from the Brighton College of Arts in 1958. He arrived in the United States two years later as both an English Speaking Union and a Fulbright Scholar and received master's degrees in architecture from the University of Michigan in 1961 and in urban design at Harvard University the following year.
        His worked with architectural firms in England, New York and Philadelphia before he set up his own office in New York in 1965. His designs included urban spaces, private homes and art galleries in Manhattan and at the Brooklyn Museum.
        He also wrote ''Mexican Architecture: The Work of Abraham Zabludovsky and Teodoro Gonzalez de Leon'' (1978), ''American Architecture: Ideas and Ideologies in the Late 20th Century'' (1993), and ''Abraham Zabludovski, 1979-93'' (1993). He lectured throughout the world and had a special affinity for Latin America, where he received professional honors in Mexico and Colombia.
        Professor Heyer is survived by his wife, Juliet Attree Heyer; his mother, Ivy Winter Heyer, also of Manhattan, and his cousins, Diane Duca of Norwalk, Conn., and John Winter of Crawley, England.
