        Joseph B. Dratch, chairman and co-founder of the Claire Dratch women's specialty store in Bethesda, Md., died Saturday at his home in Chevy Chase, Md. He was 76 years old.
        He died after a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Dratch and his wife, the former Claire Bachrach, created the store, on Wisconsin Avenue, in 1948. Since then it has catered to Washington career women, diplomats and wives of Cabinet members. He retired this year, but his wife and son David continued the business.
        Mr. Dratch was a founder and a director of Ohr Kodesh Congregation in Chevy Chase and a director of the Hebrew Home of Greater Washington.
        He was born in Boston and attended City College of New York.
        Besides his wife and son David, of Chevy Chase, he is survived by two other sons, Howard of Santa Monica, Calif., and Dr. Peter Dratch of Ashland, Ore.; a daughter, Gail Dratch of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
