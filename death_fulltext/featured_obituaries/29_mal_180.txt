        Anton Dermota, a Yugoslav tenor known for his interpretation of Mozart roles, died of heart failure on Thursday. He was 79 years old and lived in Vienna.
        Mr. Dermota was born in Kropa, Yugoslavia, and studied organ and composition before moving to Vienna to study voice. In 1936, he joined the Vienna State Opera, and remained a member of that company through the 1970's.
        The tenor made his greatest mark in Mozart roles but had a repertory of about 80 roles, among them Alfredo in Verdi's ''Traviata'' and Lensky in Tchaikovsky's ''Eugene Onegin.''
        Mr. Dermota made about 20 opera recordings, and appears as Don Ottavio in a film version of Mozart's ''Don Giovanni'' made at the 1954 Salzburg Festival, with Wilhelm Furtwangler conducting. The next year, he sang Florestan in the production of Beethoven's ''Fidelio'' that reopened the Vienna State Opera. That production was filmed and shown on television in the United States in 1957.
        As a recitalist, he frequently performed with his wife, Helga Berger-Weyerwald, a pianist.
