        Mr. Clemens joined the weekly newspaper as a copy boy when he was 16. He became editor and publisher in the late 40's and retired in 1987. Under his management, the newspaper won citations for public service and became the largest weekly in the nation, with a circulation of 20,000.
        Mr. Clemens was a member of community organizations, and, in 1985, Mayor Edward I. Koch renamed an intersection in Ridgewood in his honor.
        Surviving are his wife, Florence; a daughter, Carol Clemens-Weihs of Ridgewood; two grandchildren, and one great-grandson.
