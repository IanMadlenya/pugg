        George Stambolian, a professor of French literature and an editor of several anthologies of gay fiction, died at his home in Manhattan on Sunday. He was 54 years old.
        He died of complications from AIDS, said Michael Hampton, his companion.
        Mr. Stambolian, who also lived in Amagansett, L.I., taught French literature and contemporary theater at Wellesley College from 1966 until his retirement this year.
        Beginning in the late 1970's, Mr. Stambolian devoted more and more time to championing gay literature and art, contributing many articles and reviews to publications like The Advocate and New York Native.
        Mr. Stambolian was an advocate of gay fiction as a contemporary American literary genre, which, he believed, like urban Jewish fiction or Southern fiction or feminist fiction, could be categorized by its primary subject matter and still hold its own in both traditional and experimental narrative forms.
        In 1986, he edited the first volume of "Men on Men," a series of anthologies of gay male fiction, published by New American Library. The series, whose fourth volume is to appear next fall, has been instrumental in bringing to light the work of leading writers of gay fiction like Edmund White, Ethan Mordden and Felice Picano.
        Mr. Stambolian was a graduate of Dartmouth College and held a Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin.
        He is survived by his mother, Rose Stambolian of West Haven, Conn., and a sister, Isabel Grogan of Milford, Conn.
