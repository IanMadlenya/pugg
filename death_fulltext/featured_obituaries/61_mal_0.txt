        E. Carrington Boggan, a leading advocate of equal rights for gay men and women, died on Jan. 20 at his home in Los Angeles. He was 48 years old.
        He died of AIDS, his family said.
        As a lawyer, he represented gay litigants in several important cases. He also helped found the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, a national gay-rights organization in Manhattan.
        He was the lawyer for former Sgt. Leonard Matlovich, a Vietnam war hero discharged from the Air Force because he was a homosexual. He won reinstatement in Federal District Court in Washington. The Air Force appealed, finally settling in 1980 with a $160,000 payment, a promotion and an honorable discharge. Mr. Boggan represented Vernon E. Berg in a parallel suit against the Navy, with similar results.
        In another major case, he won a Federal court ruling in 1974 granting gay students at the University of New Hampshire the right to organize and meet on the campus.
        He had headed the editorial board of Human Rights magazine and the Individual Rights and Responsibilities Section of the American Bar Association and was on the board of the association's journal.
        Several years ago Mr. Boggan moved to Los Angeles, where he continued to practice law. Keeping his New York ties, he was of counsel to the law firm of Glazer & Gottlieb in Manhattan.
        Surviving are a brother, Robert J. Boggan, and a sister, Elizabeth Ann Mitch of Springfield, Ohio.
