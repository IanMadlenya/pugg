        Roy Cullenbine, an outfielder who batted .276 with six major league teams from 1938 to 1947, died of heart disease on Tuesday, a spokesman for Mount Clemens General Hospital said. Mr. Cullenbine was 77 years old.
        Mr. Cullenbine was among several major league players declared free agents in 1939 by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis, and he received a $25,000 bonus when he signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers that year.
        Half of Mr. Cullenbine's 10-year career was spent with his hometown Detroit Tigers, for whom he batted .335 in 1946. He also played for the New York Yankees, the Cleveland Indians, the Washington Senators and the St. Louis Browns.
