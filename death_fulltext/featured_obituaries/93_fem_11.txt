        Jerry Allen, an author and former journalist, died on Monday at her home in Norwalk, Conn. She was 83.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Marjorie Berke, a friend.
        Miss Allen was best known as a biographer of literary figures, particularly Mark Twain and Joseph Conrad. She also edited and wrote introductions for 1966 editions of Herman Melville's "Moby-Dick" and Oscar Wilde's "Picture of Dorian Gray" along with collections of short works by Melville and Conrad. Among her most successful books was "The Thunder and the Sunshine: Biography of Joseph Conrad" (1958).
        The Sorbonne honored her in 1967 for her research on Conrad, and L'Academie de Marines in France did so in 1969 for "The Sea Years of Joseph Conrad" (1965). Her "Adventures of Mark Twain" appeared in 1954.
        She was a native of Benton, Wis., and worked for The New York Herald Tribune, Reuters and the National Broadcasting Company in New York, London and Paris in the 1930's.
        She broadcast from Paris until the German Army was about to enter the city in 1940, when she escaped with fellow journalists. She worked for the Office of War Information and the State Department until 1947, when she became a freelance writer and contributor to magazines and newspapers.
