        Scott S. Huston, a composer and professor emeritus at the College-Conservatory of Music of the University of Cincinnati, died last Friday at his home here. He was 74 years old.
        Jerri Roberts, a spokeswoman for the conservatory, said that Mr. Huston had been in poor health for some time but that the cause of death was unknown.
        Mr. Huston's "Four Phantasms" was given its premiere by the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra in 1968. His cantata "Time Reflections" was introduced by the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra in 1979.
        In 1988, the College-Conservatory of Music produced his television opera "The Blind Girl," a commission by the New York City Opera.
        Mr. Huston, a graduate of the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, N.Y., was a member of the College-Conservatory of Music faculty from 1952 until his retirement in 1987.
        He is survived by his wife, Natalie, two sons and three daughters.
