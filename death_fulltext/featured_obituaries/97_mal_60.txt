        Alfred C. Edwards, a former president and chairman of Holt, Rinehart & Winston, died on Feb. 4 at his home in Natick, Mass., where he moved in 1993.
        He was 89 and had lived in New Canaan, Conn., for nearly 50 years.
        The cause was cancer, said a son, Gordon Edwards of Natick.
        When Mr. Edwards started at Holt as a business manager in 1945, the firm was the American publisher of novels by Thomas Hardy and Robert Louis Stevenson and had brought out the works of John Dewey, William James and Albert Einstein.
        After World War II, Holt moved more strongly into textbook publishing, with Mr. Edwards leading the company's growth into this and other new areas. He also presided over the promotion of the works of Robert Frost, whose poetry the company first published in 1915.
        Frost's last book, "In the Clearing" (1962), included a dedication to Mr. Edwards, the poet's friend and neighbor in Vermont.
        In 1959 Mr. Edwards negotiated the acquisition of two textbook concerns, Rinehart & Company and John C. Winston. While he headed the company, he signed former President Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife, Lady Bird, for their memoirs, Gen. Omar Bradley, Bernard Baruch and Mark Van Doren, among others.
        In 1967, CBS bought Holt, Rinehart & Winston. Mr. Edwards became chairman and was named to CBS's board. He retired in 1969.
        A 1929 graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, he was chairman emeritus of the board of Lasell College in Newton, Mass.
        Besides Gordon, he is survived by another son, Donald of Whitethorn, Calif.; a daughter, Gail Pocock of Doylestown, Pa., and nine grandchildren.
