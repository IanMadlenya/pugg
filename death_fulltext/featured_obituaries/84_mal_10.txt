        Dr. Duncan Smith Ballantine, an educator and historian, died last Tuesday at his home in Bethesda, Md. He was 81.
        He had a brief illness, his family said.
        A former college president in Portland, Ore., and Istanbul, Turkey, Dr. Ballantine retired in 1979 as director of finance for education projects at the World Bank in Washington. He continued to serve as a consultant for several more years.
        He was born in Garden City, L.I., and graduated from Deerfield Academy and Amherst College. He received a Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1947. In World War II he served as a commander in the Navy.
        Dr. Ballantine started his teaching career at the Gow School in South Wales, N.Y., in 1936. After the war he was an associate professor of history at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1953 he was named president of Reed College in Portland. He left in 1955.
        From 1955 to 1961 he was president of both Robert College and the American College for Girls in Istanbul, which merged during his tenure and were turned over to the Turkish Government. Robert College, founded in 1863 primarily for Turkish students, taught young people from many countries.
        He joined the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development in 1962 and was responsible for evaluating educational projects in developing countries and providing low-interest loans for building and improving those countries' educational institutions and programs.
        Dr. Ballantine's first marriage to Margarette Torbert of Chevy Chase, Md., ended in divorce.
        He is survived by his wife, Saffeti Acele of Bethesda; two daughters, Katherine Davy of Manhattan Beach, Calif., and Andrea S. Ballantine of Silver Spring, Md.; a son, Duncan A., of Bethesda, and two granddaughters.
