        Sam (Boom-Boom) Wheeler, who was known for his comical antics on the basketball court as a Harlem Globetrotter and for his service to the young and needy, died Sunday night at Jewish Hospital. He was 64 years old. The cause of death was not disclosed.
        Mr. Wheeler was born in Little Rock, Ark., on Nov. 15, 1924. In 1945, he joined the Globetrotters baseball team, which is no longer in existence. He moved to the basketball Globetrotters around 1950 and spent seven years playing center and forward for them.
        Mr. Wheeler was one of the main comics on the team, badgering a referee or a fan or bouncing in a shot off his head to get a laugh.
        Mr. Wheeler was also known for his volunteer work at hospitals and schools.
