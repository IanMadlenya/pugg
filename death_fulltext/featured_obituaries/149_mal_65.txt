        Jack M. Campbell, a former governor of New Mexico, died on Monday in a retirement home in Santa Fe. He was 82.
        Mr. Campbell, a Democrat, served two terms as Governor from 1963 to 1967 and four terms in the State House of Representatives, including two years as Speaker.
        Remembered for improving services for the mentally ill and reducing partisan politics in filling state jobs, Mr. Campbell also appointed the state's first science adviser, reflecting his interest in science and technology.
        Indeed, after Mr. Campbell left office, he headed the Federation of Rocky Mountain States, which used satellites to expand education in rural areas. He later received a public service award from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for using space technology to solve problems on Earth.
        Mr. Campbell also served on the Federal Atomic Safety and Licensing Board from 1967 to 1972, and, in 1983, he helped found New Mexico Technet, an early part of the Internet. A year later, along with scientists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, he helped form the Santa Fe Institute, a private research and education center.
        Born on Sept. 10, 1916, in Hutchinson, Kan., Mr. Campbell received bachelor's and law degrees from Washburn College in Topeka, Kan. He practiced law for a year in Albuquerque, N.M., became an F.B.I. agent for a year and then joined the Marines in 1942. After the war, he returned to practicing law in Albuquerque, Roswell and Santa Fe.
        He was elected to the State House of Representatives in 1955, and Governor in 1962, defeating the incumbent, Edwin L. Mechem, a Republican. Two years later, Mr. Campbell became the first Governor in the state in 12 years to win re-election.
        Mr. Campbell is survived by two sons, Michael and John Terry, both of Albuquerque; two daughters, Patricia Bobb of Chicago and Kathleen Campbell of Santa Fe, and three granddaughters.
