        Nicholas U. Mayall, an astronomer and former director of the Kitt Peak Observatory in Arizona, died Tuesday at his home in Tucson. He was 86.
        He died of complications of diabetes, his family said.
        Dr. Mayall worked on projects that helped develop scientific understanding of the origin, age and size of the universe.
        The National Science Foundation appointed him to develop and head the Kitt observatory from 1960 until his retirement in 1971. He also worked at its affiliated Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile.
        Earlier, at Lick Observatory in California, he worked on a 20-year project with astronomers at Mount Wilson and Mount Palomar on the big-bang concept of the beginning of the universe. He was a co-author of a 1955 report on research concluding that the universe is 6 billion years old, three times the previous estimate, and three times bigger than previously thought.
        At Lick he also studied galaxy movement and did studies of Pluto after its discovery.
        As a young astronomer at Mount Wilson in California, when researchers seeking to record so-called bright line stars often took photographs without success, he exposed a single plate that recorded 48 bright line stars, of which 27 were previously undiscovered.
        Born in Moline, Ill., Dr. Mayall grew up in Stockton, Calif. He earned his bachelor's degree and doctorate at the University of California at Berkeley. During World War II he did government research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
        Surviving are his wife of 58 years, the former Kathleen Boxall; a daughter, Pamela Ann Mayall of Snowflake, Ariz.; a son, Bruce I. Mayall of Viejo, Calif., and two grandsons.
