        Dr. Benjamin Esterman, an eye surgeon who helped found the specialized glaucoma clinic at the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital in 1936, died on Sunday at Peninsula Hospital Center in Far Rockaway, Queens. He was 88 and lived in Lawrence, L.I.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        In the 1960's, Dr. Esterman devised a simple and economical method of measuring loss of peripheral vision resulting from eye disease, injury or brain disorders. The American Academy of Ophthalmology honored him for it in 1972 and again two years ago, citing him also for his overall contributions in the field.
        He was associated with Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat for more than 40 years, performing thousands of operations and training hundreds of young physicians before his retirement in 1980. During those years he also worked at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center and served as director of eye surgery at Peninsula Hospital Center and Long Island Jewish Medical Center.
        Born in Vilna, Lithuania, Dr. Esterman was brought to this country as an infant and grew up in Brooklyn. He graduated from Columbia College and Cornell University Medical School and completed his specialized training at New York Post-Graduate Hospital and Knapp Memorial Hospital.
        He kept a private practice in Far Rockaway and Lawrence from 1937 until recently.
        He contributed many articles to professional journals. He also wrote "The Eye Book, a Specialist's Guide to Your Eyes and Their Care," which was published by Great Ocean Publishers in 1977 and remains in print.
        Dr. Esterman is survived by his wife of 21 years, Cinnabelle Morris Esterman; a daughter, Laura Esterman of Manhattan; three sons, Daniel of Manhattan, Mark of Arlington, Va., and the film maker Errol Morris of Cambridge, Mass., and seven grandchildren. His first wife, Sophie Milgram Esterman, died in 1968.
