        James C. Cabrera, vice chairman of the executive search firm Drake Beam Morin Inc., died Tuesday at Greenwich Hospital in Greenwich, Conn. He was 62 years old.
        Mr. Cabrera, who lived in Old Greenwich, Conn., died of cancer, his family said.
        After graduating from Rider University in Lawrenceville, N.J., he joined Drake Beam Morin in 1968 at a time when companies began using placement firms to help laid-off executives find new jobs. Mr. Cabrera helped build the firm into one of the largest in career services. He rose to executive vice president in 1975, president and chief operating officer in 1979 and vice chairman in 1992.
        An avid golfer, he also lectured and was the co-author of a number of books advising out-of-work executives, including ''Parting Company: How to Survive the Loss of a Job and Find Another Successfully,'' which became a best seller.
        He is survived by his wife, Helen, of Old Greenwich; two sons, Joseph and James, both of Old Greenwich, and six grandchildren.
