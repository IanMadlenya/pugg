        Gen. Sun Li-jen, a Nationalist Chinese war hero who was accused of trying to topple President Chiang Kai-shek, died Monday of pneumonia and sepsis, hospital officials said. He was 91.
        General Sun died at his residence in Taichung in central Taiwan, the officials said. He had been discharged earlier today from the Veterans General Hospital at his family's request, the hospital said. He had been hospitalized since last month.
        General Sun became known as "the ever-victorious general" for his feats fighting the Japanese in Burma in World War II. He served under Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell and then took his United States-equipped new First Army to Manchuria, where he fought the Communists.
        In 1955, six years after the Nationalists lost a civil war to Communist forces and retreated to Taiwan, General Sun and other officers were accused of plotting to overthrow Chiang. Some details of the episode still remain unclear.
        General Sun, who was Chiang's chief of staff between 1954 and 1955, denied the charge but was placed under house arrest. He submitted his resignation on Aug. 3, 1955, as an "admission of negligence" after a spy ring formed by a subordinate was smashed.
        General Sun was finally freed in 1988, a year after Chiang's death, when the Control Yuan, the Government's watchdog assembly, released a 1955 report that had cleared General Sun of involvement in the coup plot.
        The Control Yuan gave no explanation for delaying release of the report, but historians believe Chiang had regarded General Sun as a political rival.
        General Sun, a graduate of the Virginia Military Institute, is survived by his wife, two sons and two daughters.
