        Norman Weissman, a former president of the Ruder Finn public relations agency in New York, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 74 years old.
        The cause of death was cancer, according to a statement from Norman Weissman Inc., the firm he most recently headed, in Manhattan.
        In recent years, he had also served as chairman of Citigate Communications, a subsidiary of the British firm of the same name, and as vice chairman of the GCI Group, a subsidiary of Grey Advertising.
        Much of his career was spent at Ruder Finn, which he joined in 1958 when it was known as Ruder & Finn. He served as the agency's president from 1969 to 1986. He was also Ruder Finn's foreign specialist, handling clients that included Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the Jamaica Tourist Board and the Government of Thailand.
        Earlier, he worked four years as editor of a trade magazine, and three years for the City of New York's Department of Air Pollution Control, where he was in charge of public relations.
        He received his bachelor's degree from Rutgers University in 1949 and a master's degree from the University of Wisconsin in 1951.
        Mr. Weissman is survived by his son, Lee, of Manhattan and a brother, Seymour, of Verona, N.J.
