        Dr. Walker, an uncle of President Bush, graduated from Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1936, and did his residency at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. He was in private practice in Greenwich, Conn., and Manhattan until he was stricken with polio in 1950. The President's mother, Dorothy Bush of Greenwich, is his sister.
        Dr. Walker then began a second career in investment banking, first with G. H. Walker & Company, a family investment concern, and later as a limited partner in Alex Brown Inc.
        He also had a 25-year affiliation with Memorial Hospital, now part of Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. He served as president of the board of managers at Memorial Hospital from 1965 to 1974 and then joined the board of overseers.
        Besides his wife and Mrs. Bush, survivors include three sons, Judge John M. Walker of Manhattan, George, of Severna, Md., and Randolph, of Easton, Md.; a daughter, Elsie Kilborne of Narbeth, Pa.; two brothers, Louis, of Old Lyme, Conn., and James, of Hobe Sound, Fla.; another sister, Nancy Walker of Manhattan, and six grandchildren.
