        Shirley Potash Clurman, a retired magazine editor and television producer, died yesterday at St. Rose's Home in Manhattan. She was 74 and lived on the Upper East Side.
        The cause was cancer, her family said.
        Mrs. Clurman, a native of Los Angeles, began her career in the publicity department of 20th Century Fox before moving to New York to work as an assistant to Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d.
        She did public relations work for Time Inc. and, until the early 1960's, for the Rockefeller family, then worked as an editor at People magazine. When she retired, she was working for ABC News as an associate producer of the news magazine program ''20/20.''
        Mrs. Clurman was the widow of Richard M. Clurman, a longtime leader in New York City's cultural life and former chief of correspondents and head of Time-Life News Service. He died three years ago. She is survived by their son, Michael, of Manhattan; two stepdaughters, Susan Emma Clurman of Manhattan and Carol Mae Duning of Alexandria, Va., and a sister, Ellen Schwartz of Waco, Tex.
