        Former Vice President Aly Sabry of Egypt died today at a Cairo hospital. He was 71 years old.
        Officials at the Specialists Hospital said Mr. Sabry died of internal bleeding. He had been hospitalized after suffering a blood clot in his left lung, the officials said.
        Mr. Sabry was an air force officer who took part in the military coup, led by Gamal Abdel Nasser, that overthrew King Farouk in 1952. He was a close associate of Mr. Nasser, who became President in 1954 and died in 1970.
        Mr. Sabry became Foreign Minister in 1958, Prime Minister in 1964 and Vice President in 1965. He later was head of the Arab Socialist Union, Egypt's sole legal political organization at the time, and served as military liaison with the Soviet Union. A staunch Arab nationalist, he also was considered to be the most important pro-Soviet figure among Mr. Nasser's aides.  Arrested in 1971
        Mr. Sabry was one of those regarded as likely to succeed Mr. Nasser. But Vice President Anwar el-Sadat became President, and Mr. Sabry became one of two Vice Presidents.
        In May 1971, President Sadat dismissed Mr. Sabry and arrested him and a number of other former top aides to Mr. Nasser. They were charged with plotting a coup, along with army officers who opposed Mr. Sadat's plans to seek the assistance of the United States to promote a peace settlement with Israel and his negotiations to form a federation with Syria and Libya.
        Mr. Sabry was convicted and sentenced to death by a military tribunal, but Mr. Sadat commuted the sentence to life imprisonment at hard labor. After Mr. Sabry spent 10 years in prison, Mr. Sadat ordered his release for health reasons.
        Mr. Sadat was assassinated in 1981 by Muslim extremists.
        Mr. Sabry is to be buried after a military funeral on Sunday in Cairo, the Government said.
        No information was given about survivors.
