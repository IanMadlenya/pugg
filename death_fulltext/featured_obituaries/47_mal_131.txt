        Scott Reeve, a baritone with the New York City Opera, died on Saturday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. He was 38 years old.
        He died of complications from AIDS, said his manager, Dorothy Cone.
        Mr. Reeve made his City Opera debut in 1981, as Colline in Puccini's "Boheme." He later sang leading roles in many of the company's productions, including Bizet's "Carmen," Gluck's "Alceste" and Richard Strauss's "Ariadne auf Naxos." In 1986 he appeared as Maximilian on the PBS telecast of Leonard Bernstein's "Candide" and re-created the role for the recording.
        Mr. Reeve grew up in Bloomington, Ind., and graduated from Indiana University. He sang with opera companies in several American and European cities, including Santa Fe, Cincinnati, Houston, Paris, Cologne and Geneva and at the Spoleto Festival U.S.A. He was a guest soloist with the New York Philharmonic and the Israel Philharmonic.
        He is survived by his parents, June and Carl Reeve of Bloomington, and two brothers, Brian and David.
