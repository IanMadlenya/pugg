        Richard Derr, a veteran stage and screen actor who starred on Broadway in plays by Herman Wouk, Elmer Rice and Christopher Fry, died on May 8 in St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 74 years old and lived in West Hollywood, Calif.
        He died of pancreatic cancer, said Lee Hale, a friend.
        Mr. Derr was born in Norristown, Pa. His theatrical career began at Jasper Deeter's Hedgerow Theater in a Philadelphia suburb, and soon a talent scout persuaded him to try his luck in Hollywood. By 1942, he had graduated from B-melodramas to supporting roles in major attractions like "The Commandos Strike at Dawn," with Paul Muni.
        During World War II, he was a navigator with Air Transport Command, shuttling among Miami, Brazil and Africa. After the war, he re-established his career, appearing in films like "The Secret Heart" and "Joan of Arc," with Ingrid Bergman.
        His starring roles in Hollywood were few; one was in the 1956 science fiction film "When Worlds Collide." He was more often a leading man on Broadway. He scored a success in Jed Harris's 1949 production of Herman Wouk's first play, "The Traitor," and was in "A Phoenix Too Frequent," by Fry, in 1950. In 1951 he appeared opposite Beatrice Straight in Rice's "Grand Tour." In 1955, he made his singing debut in "Plain and Fancy," a musical about the Amish of Pennsylvania.
        He is survived by a brother, Rodman, of Southhampton, L.I.
