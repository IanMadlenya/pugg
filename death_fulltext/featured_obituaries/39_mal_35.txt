        Willie Musarurwa, a veteran journalist who spent 10 years in jail for his political activities, died on Tuesday, apparently of a heart attack, hospital officials said. He was 62 years old.
        Mr. Musarurwa collapsed at a lunch attended by Ambassador Steven Rhodes of the United States. Mr. Rhodes had arrived a few hours earlier to take up his first foreign diplomatic posting.
        Mr. Musarurwa was jailed without trial for 10 years because of political activity against white rule before Zimbabwe's independence in 1980.
        In 1985 he was dismissed as chief editor of Zimbabwe's main Sunday newspaper after President Robert Mugabe accused him of being overly critical of the Government.
