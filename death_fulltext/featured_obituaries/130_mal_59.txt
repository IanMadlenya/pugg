        Georgie Tapps, a tap soloist and Broadway musical dancer, died on Nov. 1 at St. Joseph's Center Hospital in Burbank, Calif. He was 85 and lived in Los Angeles.
        In Mr. Tapps's heyday, in the 1930's and 40's, he performed in nightclubs and cabarets, in films that included ''Vogues of 1938,'' and in Broadway shows like George M. Cohan's ''I'd Rather Be Right'' and Rodgers and Hart's ''Pal Joey,'' in which he replaced Gene Kelly. Mr. Tapps was described by the legendary tap dancer Bill Robinson as ''tops in the field of straight tap.'' John Martin, dance critic of The New York Times, wrote that Mr. Tapps ''simply does everything that can be done with a pair of shoes and a hardwood floor.''
        Born Mortimer Alphonse Becker, Mr. Tapps was given his stage name by the owner of a club in New York City where he performed at 16. His training began when he was spotted dancing in a church benefit at age 7 by a theatrical producer who offered him a scholarship to study ballet, which he combined with tap early on. He made his Broadway debut singing and dancing in ''Americana'' in the 1920's.
        In 1939, Mr. Tapps became the center of a much-publicized case brought before Actors Equity, the theater union. He had been paying commissions to two talent agencies during the run of ''I'd Rather Be Right'' amounting to 15 percent of his salary, triple the percentage allowed by Equity. Mr. Tapps was reprimanded by the union, which ordered that the excess payments be given by the agents to Equity's emergency fund.
        Mr. Tapps was one of four dancers to be featured in 1952 in a demonstration of the Eidophore, a device developed by 20th Century Fox for television broadcasts of live entertainment in color on a motion-picture screen.
        In 1967, unable to find work in New York, Mr. Tapps moved to Los Angeles. He worked as a salesman in a clothing store in Beverly Hills and taught acting and singing. No immediate family members survive.
