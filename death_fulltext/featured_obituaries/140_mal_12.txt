        Stephen Syms Merns, an apparel-chain executive and a philanthropist, died last Saturday during an outing to Columbia County in northern New York State. He was 45 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was a heart attack suffered while swimming ashore from a canoe, said Doug Meyer, senior vice president for marketing at the Syms Corporation, of which Mr. Merns was a vice president and director.
        A native of Brooklyn, he studied business at Pace University and established his own export business before joining the family business as a buyer in 1980. He soon assumed a role in the senior management of the chain of 43 apparel stores in 16 states founded by his father, Sy Syms.
        Following the family tradition of philanthropy, he helped many organizations, including the U.J.A.-Federation of New York; Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America; State of Israel Bonds; Lighthouse Charities; Floating Hospital, and the National Committee to Prevent Child Abuse.
        Mr. Merns is survived by his wife, the former Karen Benz; three children, Jillian, Daniel and Olivia; his parents, Sy Syms of Manhattan, board chairman of the company, and Ruth Merns of Fort Lee, N.J.; three sisters, Marcy Syms Merns of Manhattan, the company's president; Laura Merns of Miami and Adrienne Merns of Southampton, N.Y., and two brothers, Robert Merns of Manhattan and Richard Merns of Boca Raton, Fla.
