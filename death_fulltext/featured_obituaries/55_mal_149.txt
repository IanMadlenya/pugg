        Minor Lee Rogers, a specialist in Japanese Buddhism and a professor of religion at Washington & Lee University, died Sunday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. He was 61 years old and lived in Lexington, Va.
        His son, Dr. John D. Rogers, said he died of complications from metastatic cancer diagnosed six weeks ago.
        The British-born Dr. Rogers graduated from Virginia Military Institute and was ordained an Episcopal priest after serving as a lieutenant in an American Army armored unit in the Korean War. He spent several years as a missionary in Kyushu, Japan, in the early 1960's.
        He received a Ph.D. in comparative religion from Harvard University in 1972, the year he joined the faculty of Washington & Lee in Lexington. He was chairman of the department of religion there from 1984 to 1989.
        Besides his son, a resident of Yonkers, Dr. Rogers is survived by his wife, the former Ann Tutwiler; a daughter, Elizabeth L. of Chicago; another son, Thomas S. of Tokyo, and a sister, Josephine Morrison, of Lexington.
