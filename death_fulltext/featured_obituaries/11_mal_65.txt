        For more than five decades after his graduation from Harvard Medical School, Dr. Bloomberg worked as a physician and an administrator of community mental-health affairs. He served on the faculties of Harvard University, Boston University and the University of California.
        Dr. Bloomberg was chief of psychiatry and neurology service at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Boston when the Southern Regional Education Board asked him in 1956 to administer its program in mental health training and research in Atlanta. The program covered 16 states.
        Gov. Abraham Ribicoff brought him to Connecticut in 1958, and after he left in 1969 he served as deputy commissioner of mental health in Massachusetts until his retirement in 1975.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Harriet Agoos, whom he married in 1978 after the death of his first wife, Mary Richmond. Also surviving are a brother, Allen, of Manhattan, and a granddaughter.
