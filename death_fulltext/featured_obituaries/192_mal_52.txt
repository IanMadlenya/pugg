        Stephen Kates, a cellist and teacher who was a Tchaikovsky International Cello Competition prizewinner, died on Saturday at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. He was 59 and lived in Annapolis, Md.
        The cause was lymphoma, said his wife, Mary Louise.
        Mr. Kates won the silver medal (the second prize) at the Tchaikovsky competition in Moscow in 1966, when he was just 23, though he had already appeared as a soloist with the New York Philharmonic.
        After winning the award, he toured widely as a soloist and played recitals. In addition to the New York Philharmonic, he performed with the Boston Symphony, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Chicago Symphony, the Baltimore Symphony, the Pittsburgh Symphony and the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and at the Spoleto, Aspen, Sitka and other festivals. He recorded for RCA, Arabesque, Bainbridge and other labels.
        In a review of a concert at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1968, Peter G. Davis of The New York Times wrote, ''Mr. Kates rejoices not only in prodigious bow and finger technique, but also in a personal flair that communicates itself immediately to an audience.''
        Mr. Kates was born in New York City and graduated from the Juilliard School of Music. He also studied with Gregor Piatigorsky at the University of Southern California.
        His father, David Kates, was a violist at the New York Philharmonic for 43 years and his mother's family had three generations of professional cellists.
        He was a professor at the Peabody Conservatory of Music in Baltimore for 28 years. He returned to the Tchaikovsky competition in 1986 as a juror.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by his father, of Pittsburgh, and his brother, Michael, of Somers, N.Y.
