        Mr. Twitchell was born in Brooklyn, graduated from Princeton and earned a master's degree from Oxford University. He first came in contact with Moral Re-Armament in London, where it was founded to reshape the world through ''absolute'' morality. He worked for the movement until 1973, when he retired.
        He was the author of ''Regeneration in the Ruhr: The Unknown Story of a Decisive Answer to Communism in Postwar Europe,'' published by Princeton University Press.
        Surviving are his wife, Marion; a son, H. Kenaston Jr., of Waterbury Center, Vt.; two daughters, Anne Twitchell Wishard of Reston, Va., and Patricia, of Princeton, and five grandchildren.
