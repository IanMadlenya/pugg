        Dr. Samuel R. Gerber, who served as Cuyahoga County coroner for 50 years until his retirement five months ago, died Saturday. He was 88 years old.
        Dr. Gerberdied of arteriosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries, said the Acting Coroner, Dr. Lester Adelson. In December, he retired citing poor health with two years remaining on his last four-year term as coroner.
        He became nationally known in the 1954 trial of Dr. Samuel H. Sheppard, whose conviction for the murder of his wife, Marilyn, was later overturned because of the huge amount of publicity that accompanied the trial.
        Dr. Gerber was appointed to the medical school faculty of Western Reserve University in 1952 and became an assistant clinical professor of legal medicine at the merged Case Western Reserve University in 1967.
