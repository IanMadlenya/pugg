        Leon Liebgold, a veteran actor who performed for 50 years on the Yiddish stage and starred in films during the golden age of Yiddish movie-making in the 1930's, died on Sept. 3 in New Hope, Pa. He was 83.
        Mr. Liebgold starred as the ill-fated son in the 1937 Yiddish film classic, "The Dybbuk," and also played a leading role in the 1936 film "Yidl Mit'n Fidl," with Molly Picon.
        He also appeared in stage productions of "The Dybbuk" for many years. Among other plays in which he performed were "Mazel Tov, Molly" (1950); "Man Without a Home" (1952); "The Wedding March" (1956); "My Son and I" (1960); "God, Man and the Devil" (1975); "A Goldfaden Dream" (1979); "The Romanian Wedding" (1981); "The Marriage Contract" (1982); "L'Chaim to Life" (1986), and "Riverside Drive" (1987). He retired in the late 1980's, said Seymour Rexite, president of the Hebrew Actors Union in Manhattan.
        In the late 1970's Mr. Liebgold was president of the union, one of the oldest theatrical unions in the United States. And for four years, in the late 1970's and early 1980's, he was president of the Theatrical Alliance, known informally as the Yiddish actor's fund, a welfare organization for actors based in New York.  A Vaudeville Performer
        Mr. Liebgold was born in Kracow, Poland, where he became a vaudeville performer; he was also a member of the Vilna Troupe, a famous Yiddish theater company, and acted in several films, including "The Dybbuk" and "Yidl Mit'n Fidl," which were both shot in Poland.
        He came to the United States in the late 1930's, Mr. Rexite said, and subsequently worked in most of the Yiddish Theaters in America. Mr. Rexite said Mr. Liebgold served as a sergeant in the United States Army during World War II.
        Mr. Liebgold was married to the actress Lili Liliana, who was cast in the 1937 film of "The Dybbuk" as the girl possessed by the evil spirit of the title. The two performed for many years onstage together. She died several years ago, Mr. Rexite said.
        He is survived by a brother, Yonek, of New Hope.
