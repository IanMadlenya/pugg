        Alexander Abraham, a retired investment banker and a philanthropist who sponsored low-cost housing for the homeless, died on Sunday at his home in Rye, N.Y. He was 83. The cause was a stroke, his family said.
        Mr. Abraham was chairman of his family's investment firm, Abraham & Company, when it merged with Lehman Brothers in the 1970's.
        After the merger, he became vice chairman of Lehman Brothers and held other posts there and at successor firms. He retired in the mid-1990's.
        Concerned about homelessness in New York City, he put up part of the money for the opening, in 1987, of the Alexander Abraham Residence on West 51st Street in Manhattan to provide interim housing and other services for homeless women and children.
        He also co-sponsored the construction of more than half a dozen additional facilities intended to provide permanent low-income housing and services, including psychotherapy and job counseling, for formerly homeless people, both men and women, many of them with mental and physical problems. Another such facility is being built.
        Mr. Abraham was a trustee of the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan, of which he had been president. He also established the David Abraham Fellowship Fund, at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, in memory of a grandson who died of cancer.
        Born in Woodmere, N.Y., he grew up in Manhattan and graduated from Harvard. He married Helene Wilk in 1943; she died in February.
        Surviving are a daughter, Nancy; a son, James; and three grandchildren.
