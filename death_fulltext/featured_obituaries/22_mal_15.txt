        Ken Niles, a pioneering radio broadcaster whose career extended from the 1920's through the 1940's, died of heart failure Monday in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 82 years old. Mr. Niles began his broadcasting career in Washington State and California shortly after the first radio stations went on the air. He was a producer and announcer for the Don Lee Network, a West Coast radio network that was later acquired by CBS. Mr. Niles began a series of original radio dramas called ''Theater of the Mind'' in 1928. In the mid-1930's, he was the producer and host, with Louella Parsons, of ''Hollywood Hotel,'' a variety show that featured interviews with movie stars and introduced the song ''Hooray for Hollywood.''
        His later shows included ''The Bing Crosby Show'' and ''The Abbott and Costello Show,'' and he was frequently on the air with his brother, Wendell, another noted radio announcer. Mr. Niles also appeared in about 20 movies, and wrote magazine articles about conservation.
        Mr. Niles is survived by his wife, Nadia, of Beverly Hills, Calif.; three brothers, Wendell, of Toluca Lake, Calif., Russell, of San Francisco, and Donald, of Seattle; a sister, Grace, of Seattle; a son, Ken Jr., and a daughter, Denise, both of Los Angeles, and four grandchildren.
