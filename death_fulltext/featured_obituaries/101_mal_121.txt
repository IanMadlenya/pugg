        Raphael Levy, a writer and publicity agent who played a major role in mobilizing American Jewish support for Israel in its early days, died on Friday at his home in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. He was 86.
        The cause was prostate cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Levy wrote and produced three films documenting the migration of Jewish refugees to Israel after World War II. Two in particular, "A Day of Deliverance," released in 1948, and "Children of the Exodus," made in 1967, were shown repeatedly at dinners and rallies to raise money, and occasionally on television.
        Mr. Levy wrote dozens of the speeches that American Jewish leaders delivered at fund-raising events for Israel and put together the early advertising campaigns in support of the new nation, founded in 1948. He did this as director of public relations for the National United Jewish Appeal from 1951 through 1967, then as director of special events for the United Jewish Appeal until 1974.
        After his retirement, Mr. Levy contributed to Jewish anthologies. He wrote about his great-uncle, Dr. Solomon Schechter, who in 1915 had discovered ancient manuscripts in the attic of a synagogue in Cairo that shed new light on Jewish history. Years later, Dr. Schechter's work helped scholars understand the Dead Sea scrolls.
        Mr. Levy was born in Hartford. His father, a cabinetmaker, had emigrated from Palestine. His mother came from Romania. Mr. Levy received a B.A. from New York University in 1932, and worked in commercial advertising and then in the Office of War Information during World War II.
        Mr. Levy is survived by his wife, the former Florence Cooper; a brother, Lee, of Englewood, N.J.; a daughter, Joan Levy Weiss of North Tarrytown; a son, Frank, of Newton, Mass., and four grandchildren.
