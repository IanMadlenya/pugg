        John C. Foreman, the producer of the 1985 hit movie "Prizzi's Honor" and other films, died yesterday at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif. He was 67 years old.
        His doctor, Charles Kivowitz, said he died of a heart attack.
        Mr. Foreman was the producer of the 1969 film "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford. The film was released a year after the formation of the Newman-Foreman Company, a production company founded by the producer and the actor. Mr. Foreman's other productions include "The Man Who Would Be King," "The Great Train Robbery," "The Effects of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds," "The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean" and "The McIntosh Man."
        Mr. Foreman was born in Idaho Falls, Idaho. He taught English literature at Stephens College in Missouri and was in the Navy in World War II. In 1982 he became vice president in charge of worldwide theatrical production for MGM/U.A. Before becoming a producer, he was a co-founder of the Creative Management Agency, which later became I.C.M. He also worked for MCA and Rogers & Cowan, a public relations agency.
        He is survived by his wife, Linda; two daughters, Julie, of New York City, and Amanda, of Beverly Hills; and two sisters, Darhl , of Gates Mills, Ohio, and Marcene Johnson, of Pocatella, Iowa.
