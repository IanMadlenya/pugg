        Dr. Eugene C. Klein, a founding member of the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York, died on Thursday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. He was 82 and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of emphysema, his son said.
        Dr. Klein was one of the first doctors to join the Health Insurance Plan, which, organized in 1947, was one of the nation's first prepaid comprehensive health plans. He was medical director of HIP practices at the Barsky Medical Group and later at the Manhattan West Medical Center.
        In 1972 Dr. Klein, who had long advocated patient participation in medical care, founded the first "consumer group" of HIP subscribers, an advisory board made up of patients.
        Dr. Klein was born in Manhattan and earned a bachelor's degree at New York University and a medical degree at Temple University in 1934. After completing his residency at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan, he enlisted in the Army and served throughout World War II. He was discharged at the end of the war with the rank of major.
        Dr. Kelin was also affiliated with the Hospital for Joint Diseases in Manhattan.
        His wife, Helen, died six months ago. He is survived by a son, Steven, of Chicago, and four granddaughters.
