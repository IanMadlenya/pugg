        Clive S. Menell, the deputy chairman of Anglovaal Ltd., a South African mining conglomerate, died yesterday at the age of 65.
        The cause of death was cancer, said Paul Theron, a spokesman for Anglovaal.
        Anglovaal is South Africa's fifth biggest gold producer, with interests in mining, financial services, food, cement, textiles, packaging, construction and  engineering.
        Mr. Menell was the eldest sun of Slip Menell, one of the founders of the Anglovaal group. Clive Menell joined the company in 1956.
        He was a founder of the Urban Foundation in 1977, an organization created to  improve the lot of black South Africans in Soweto and other urban areas.
        "We became involved because we were scared," Mr. Menell said after the group  was founded. "There was a concern for the country, of course, but there was also a selfish concern for our assets."
        Mr. Menell was the only person to serve on the board of the Urban Foundation  from its inception until it was succeeded by a new group know as the National Business Initiative, for which he served as deputy chairman.
        He was the deputy chairman of the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund and acted for the President as chairman of the board of trustees of that group.
        Mr. Menell relinquished the post of administrative director of the company on June 1 to David Barber. He is survived by his wife, Irene, and five children. A  private funeral will be held in Cape Town on Friday.
