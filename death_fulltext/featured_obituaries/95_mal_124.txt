        Louis Martinz, a Panamanian businessman who was a former spokesman for President Guillermo Endara of Panama as well as a former diplomat and publisher, died on Monday at his home in Panama City. He was 54.
        The cause was pneumonia, said his niece Ana Victoria Posse de Vallarino.
        Before serving as a senior aide to President Endara, who held office from 1989 until September of this year, Mr. Martinz was chief of protocol, had the rank of ambassador, and was prominent in cultural affairs under President Arnulfo Arias, who was ousted in 1968 by a military coup. Mr. Martinz then went into exile, mainly in New York, until 1978.
        Back in Panama, he became the publisher of Ya!, a newspaper opposed to the military Government, which jailed him twice for publicly opposing the de facto ruler, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
        In 1989, the United States invaded Panama and installed a civilian Government led by Mr. Endara.
        In addition to his niece, Mrs. Posse de Vallarino, of Panama City, Mr. Martinz's survivors include his mother, Rosita Andersen de Martinz, also of Panama City.
