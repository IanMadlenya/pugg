        The Rev. Edward Gardiner Latch, a retired Methodist minister who was Chaplain of the House of Representatives from 1967 to 1978, died Friday at Asbury Methodist Village in Gaithersburg, Md. A resident of Gaithersburg, he was 92.
        Mr. Latch led the House in morning prayers through the troubled days of the Watergate scandal.
        A highlight of his tenure came in June 1971, when he officiated at the wedding of President Richard M. Nixon's elder daughter, Patricia, to Edward Finch Cox. He pronounced them husband and wife in a white pavilion set in the Rose Garden outside the President's West Wing office suite.
        Mr. Latch's ties to the Nixons predated his years as House Chaplain. Before Speaker John W. McCormack named him to that post, he was pastor of the Metropolitan Memorial Methodist Church in Washington, the university church of American University.
        Mr. Nixon was a Quaker who attended different Protestant churches. He visited Mr. Latch's church fairly regularly when not traveling, sitting in the McKinley pew, named after the 25th President.
        A native of Philadelphia, Mr. Latch graduated from Dickinson College and Drew Theological Seminary and studied for an additional year in the Christian education department of Northwestern University. He was ordained in 1924 and became pastor of Metropolitan Memorial Methodist in 1941.
        Mr. Latch is survived by his wife of 67 years, the former Rieta van der Vies; a daughter, Rieta Maxwell of Bethesda, Md.; three grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
