        Herve Bazin, a highly regarded French novelist and for the last two decades the president of the Goncourt Academy, which awards France's most prestigious literary prize, died last Saturday at his home near Angers, the Loire Valley city in which he was born. He was 84.
        The announcement was made by Francois Nourissier, the secretary of the academy.
        Mr. Bazin's first novel, "Viper in the Fist," an angry look back at a battle between a monstrous mother and her three sons, was acclaimed when it was published in France in 1948. The book won the Prix Apollinaire and the Prix des  Lecteurs and remained the foundation of his work.
        In his fiction, Mr. Bazin often wrote about emotional deprivation and mental  and physical illness. His second novel, "Head Against the Wall," was, he said, about "the life of a psychopath under the old asylum system." Among Mr. Bazin's  other books are "Constance," "A Tribe of Women," "Death of the Little Horse" and, two years ago, "The Ninth Day."
        Mr. Bazin was married four times and had seven children.
