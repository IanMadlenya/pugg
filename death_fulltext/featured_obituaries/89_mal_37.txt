        Dr. Akira Mitsui, a marine scientist and professor of the University of Miami, died on May 31 at Mercy Hospital in Miami. He was 65.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Mitsui had an international reputation for his research of blue-green algae, an area that may hold vast potential for industrial use. He explored the possibility of applying marine algae in the production of new chemicals, food, medicines, energy and aquaculture technologies. The objective is to conserve limited resources and to create a cleaner environment through nonpolluting fuels. He carried on his work at the university's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science on Virginia Key, off Miami Beach.
        A native of Shizuoka, Japan, he received his Ph.D. in plant physiology at the University of Tokyo.
        Dr. Mitsui is survived by three daughters, Akiko Mary Mitsui of Manhattan and Kimii Catherine Mitsui and Lillyanne Naiomi Mitsui, both of Miami.
