        Giorgio Belladonna, one of the greatest bridge players of all time, died on Friday in Rome. He was 72 years old.
        The cause was lung cancer, said his daughter, Anna Marchiori.
        Mr. Belladonna was ranked first by the World Bridge Federation based on a long career that included 16 world team championship victories, a record. In 1956 he joined Italy's Blue Team, which became the most famous in the history of the game. With Walter Avarelli he played his own bidding method, the Roman System, and they helped Italy win the European Team Championship. This qualified them to compete in the world championship in 1957 in New York, where they defeated the United States.
        This victory in the Bermuda Bowl, emblem of world supremacy, began an unbeaten string. The Italians won again in 1958, 1959, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1965, 1966, 1967 and 1969, when Mr. Avarelli retired from serious play. The Blue Team also won the World Team Olympiad in 1964 and 1968.
        After a two-year hiatus, the Blue Team returned and Mr. Belladonna had a new partner, Benito Garozzo, and new teammates. They won the Team Olympiad in 1972, and the Bermuda Bowl in 1973, 1974, and 1975. That was their last victory, although they came very close on two later occasions, 1979 and 1983. They also won 10 European team titles.
        In 1967 Mr. Belladonna was cited as the best individual player at the European Championships, thanks in part to his brilliant defense on the following deal:  [ Diagram ] .
        Belladonna as West doubled the two-club overcall for penalties and won the first trick with the heart queen. Needing to reach his partner's hand, he underled his diamond ace. East won the king, and cashed his two heart winners. Belladonna promptly threw the nine and ace of diamonds, a defense that was both spectacular and essential.
        East led a low diamond and South did the best he could by ruffing with the club nine. Belladonna then made another key play by discarding a spade. South could not then avoid losing two trump tricks to go one down. Later analysis demonstrated that the contract would have been made if Belladonna had failed to discard his diamonds or had overruffed the club nine.
        As a theorist, Mr. Belladonna collaborated with Mr. Garozzo in the development of the Super Precision System. He wrote one book, and was a newspaper bridge columnist. At the age of 16 he was a potential soccer star, but World War II interrupted that career path. He worked as an official in Rome's Social Security Administration, retiring in 1970.
        Besides his daughter, he is survived by his wife, Maria Antonietta, a son, Renato, and two grandchildren.
