        Dr. Philip Knapp, professor emeritus of ophthalmology at Columbia University, died on Sunday at Dunroven Nursing Home in Cresskill, N.J. He was 75 years old and lived in Tenafly, N.J.
        Colleagues said he died of prostate cancer.
        A native New Yorker, Dr. Knapp graduated from Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1941. Following wartime service in the Navy, he trained at the University of Iowa and joined the staff of the Edward S. Harkness Eye Institute of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in 1951.
        Dr. Knapp became known for his expertise on surgery for strabismus -- eye-muscle disorder -- and for eye-movement disorders, publishing papers and teaching at international meetings. He was also director of the Harkness Institute's Fight for Sight Children's Eye Clinic from 1961 to 1979. He became a professor emeritus in 1973 but continued practicing at Columbia until this summer.
        In his profession, Dr. Knapp followed in the footsteps of his grandfather, Dr. Herman Knapp, who in 1869 founded the New York Ophthalmic and Aural Institute, later a part of Columbia-Presbyterian. His father, Dr. Arnold Knapp, was also a Columbia ophthalmology professor.
        Dr. Knapp is survived by a son, John. A., of Manassas, Va.; a daughter, Susan E. Lyons of Schaumburg, Ill.; a sister, Elizabeth Knapp of Charleston, S.C., and five grandchildren.
