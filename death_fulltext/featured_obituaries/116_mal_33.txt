        Blair Walliser, a director and writer who was a pioneer in radio drama during radio's golden age, died on Aug. 31 in New York Hospital. He was 87 and lived in Manhattan.
        One of Mr. Walliser's best-known credits was the soap opera ''The Romance of Helen Trent,'' which he directed for 10 years while it was based in Chicago. The program had its premiere on CBS in 1933. In his 1976 book ''Tune in Yesterday,'' the radio historian John Dunning wrote that it ''stands today as the ultimate in high camp.''
        A Chicago-born graduate of Northwestern University, Mr. Walliser was also one of the directors of ''Backstage Wife,'' a serial drama which made its debut in 1935, and later directed and wrote for ''Harold Teen,'' a situation comedy based on a comic strip.
        After serving in the Coast Guard during World War II, Mr. Walliser rose to be, among other things, a high-ranking executive of the Mutual Broadcasting System. Early in 1959, while he was executive vice president and a director, he took part in negotiations for the sale of Mutual.
        He is survived by his wife, Ursula; four daughters, Tristanne, Bretaigne and Hilary, and Lorian Pollack; a son, Shane; and a sister, Ruth Lieban.
