        Aaron F. Goldstein, a former New York State Supreme Court justice and a former state assemblyman from Brooklyn, died Oct. 27 at a hospital in Westwood, Calif. He was 90.
        Justice Goldstein, who lived much of his life in Brooklyn and Queens but spent his later years in retirement in Hollywood, Fla., was visiting his sons in California before his death, said his wife, Sophie.
        He spent 27 years on the bench, from 1960 to 1987, first as a city magistrate, appointed by Mayor Robert F. Wagner, and later as a State Supreme Court justice.
        As a jurist, he is perhaps best remembered for a 1985 decision that New York City did not violate the Constitution when it permitted Orthodox Jews in Queens to use city property to mark off a 90-block area for religious purposes.
        The area in question, on the Rockaway Peninsula, was delineated by stringing nylon cord between street lights and raising the height of sea walls. That created what is called an eruv, which allows Orthodox Jews to carry or wheel things, actions that would be forbidden on the Sabbath except in their own homes.
        Justice Goldstein ruled that ''the actions of the city agencies did not establish religion but were a valid accommodation to religious practice.'' He added that the United States Supreme Court had mandated ''accommodation for religious purposes.''
        A Democrat, Justice Goldstein also served in the State Assembly from 1934 to 1936 and from 1939 to 1940. There, he fought for laws that would ban Nazi activities by prohibiting camps where racial hatred or libel was preached.
        Aaron Frank Goldstein was born on Jan. 30, 1909, in Brooklyn. He received a law degree from St. John's Law School.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by two sons, Dr. Edward M. Goldstein of San Diego and Dr. Leonard I. Goldstein of Malibu, Calif.; six grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.
