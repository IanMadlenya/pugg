        Angus D. Henderson, who started his civil engineering career by taking a correspondence course and rose to become an authority on public water-supply systems through his work on Long Island, died on Wednesday at the R. H. Dedman Memorial Hospital in Dallas. He was 84 years old and lived in Dallas.
        He died of a stroke, a family spokeswoman said.
        Mr. Henderson was a partner in Henderson & Bodwell Consulting Engineers in Plainview, L.I., a company he founded in 1975. He was internationally known for his engineering expertise in water supply and in waste-water treatment. He retired in 1981.
        From 1953 to 1975, he was with Henderson & Casey in Westbury, L.I., and helped develop water-supply systems for Plandome, Manhassett-Lakeville, Westbury and Sea Cliff.
        He had no formal training in engineering and earned his professional credentials through self-education and by completing an engineering course from the International Correspondence School in 1934. He then worked for New York City and was responsible for maintenance of its aqueducts and pumping stations.
        He is survived by two daughters, Barbara Sherry of Dallas and Janet Bird of Seaside, Ore.; a brother, James, of Hicksville, L.I.; seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
