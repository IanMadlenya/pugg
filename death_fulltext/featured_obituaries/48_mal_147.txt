        Dr. Philip Bond, who combined careers as a radiologist and opera singer, died on Monday at St. Francis Hospital in Roslyn, L.I. He was 81 years old and lived in Port Washington, L.I.
        Dr. Bond died of cancer, his wife, Marjorie Wellock Bond, said.
        After World War II, he went into private practice in Manhattan. An accomplished bass with a three-octave range, he gave a well-received recital at Carnegie Hall in 1950. He also sang bass roles for a season with the City Opera Company, and acted as house physician for the Metropolitan Opera after he attracted Toscanini's attention at a voice audition.
        In 1960, he moved his practice to Port Washington and remained in practice until last year.
        He graduated from City College and in 1934 he graduated magna cum laude from the Heidelberg Medical School in Germany. He also studied music in Germany.
        In 1936 and 1937, he was a medical officer with the Civilian Conservation Corps. In 1938, he went into private practice in Brooklyn.
        In 1942, he joined the Army Medical Corps in China, where he received a Bronze Star.
        In addition to his wife, a soprano Dr. Bond often supported in musical comedies and light opera roles, he is survived by three daughters, Evgenia Bond of Albany; Judith Green of Port Washington, and Victoria Peskin of Roanoke, Va.
