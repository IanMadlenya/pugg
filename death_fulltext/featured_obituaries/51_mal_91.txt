        David Scribner, a lawyer who specialized in civil liberties and labor law, died on Wednesday at the Kingsbridge Center of the Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged in the Bronx. He was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of heart failure, his family said.
        In a career that spanned 60 years, Mr. Scribner was part of the defense team that represented the Scottsboro Boys, nine black men accused in a highly publicized rape case in Alabama in the early 1930's. In the 1940's and 1950's, as general counsel of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, he represented labor leaders accused of being Communists by the House Committee on Un-American Activities and the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee.
        Mr. Scribner was active in the International Labor Defense, a group that defended workers' right to strike, picket and demonstrate. He took on many cases with political overtones over the years, representing the Puerto Rican Independence Movement, families of Black Panthers who were killed by the police in Chicago in 1969, Kent State students in the aftermath of the 1970 shootings at the university in Ohio, and prisoners at Attica after the 1971 riot in the New York prison.
        Mr. Scribner, who was born in Russia and raised on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, attended City College and was a graduate of the Brooklyn Law School. He was a founder of the National Lawyers Guild and an officer of the Center for Constitutional Rights and the Labor Research Association.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Sylvia Cohen; four daughters, Toni, of St. James, N.Y., Wendy Scribner and Aggie Kapelman, both of Manhattan, and Nancy Jaslow of Abington, Pa.; a son, Oliver, of Vancouver; a brother, Jack Schriftman, who lives in Florida, and seven grandchildren.
