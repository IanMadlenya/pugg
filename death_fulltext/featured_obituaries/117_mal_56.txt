At the State Department, he was senior adviser to the United States Representative to the United Nations Economic and Social Council.

        Correction:  November 7, 1996, Thursday
        An obituary on Oct. 20 about Clarence I. Blau, a former New Deal official and member of the United States Mission to the United Nations, misstated the surname of one of his surviving daughters. She is Ruth Blau, of Arlington, Va., not Ruth North.
