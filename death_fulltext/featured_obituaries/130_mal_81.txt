        James Robert Baker, a novelist known for his wildly imaginative satires, committed suicide on Nov. 5 at his home in Pacific Palisades, Calif., said Ken Camp, a friend. He was 50.
        Mr. Baker was a graduate of the film school at the University of California at Los Angeles, where he won the school's Samuel Goldwyn Writing Award. His novels include ''Adrenaline,'' written under the pseudonym James Dillinger, about two gay fugitives; ''Fuel-Injected Dreams,'' a satire of the rock music industry, and ''Boy Wonder,'' about a Hollywood producer. He also wrote and directed ''Mouse Klub Konfidential,'' about a gay pornographer.
        He is survived by his companion, Ron Robertson, and a brother, Douglas, of Long Beach, Calif.
