        Thomas P. Ronan, a former foreign correspondent for The New York Times, died on Oct. 31 in Kennett Square, Pa. He was 96.
        His daughter Catherine confirmed the death.
        Mr. Ronan was on the staff of The Times from 1942 until his retirement in 1978. From 1953 to 1962, he was a reporter in the paper's London bureau, covering economics, politics, government and diplomacy.
        Thomas Patrick Ronan was born in New York City on Dec. 10, 1908, and received an undergraduate degree from Fordham University in 1931. He began his journalism career as a reporter for The City News Association, a news agency later absorbed by The Associated Press.
        In the spring of 1942, Mr. Ronan went to work at The Times, where he was assigned to the radio broadcast desk. That fall, he entered the Army, serving in India and China during World War II. After the war, he returned to the paper as a metropolitan reporter.
        After his London assignment, Mr. Ronan rejoined the metropolitan staff of The Times. In May 1965, he was the first to report that Representative John V. Lindsay had decided to run for mayor. Lindsay defeated Abraham D. Beame in November of that year.
        In addition to his daughter Catherine, of Los Angeles, Mr. Ronan is survived by his wife of 57 years, the former Patricia Clow; another daughter, Laura, of Dresden, Maine; a son, Stephen, of Cambridge, Mass.; and two grandchildren.
