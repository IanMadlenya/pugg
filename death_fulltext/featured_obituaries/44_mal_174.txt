        He died of pneumonia, a family member said.
        A graduate of Washington and Lee University, Mr. Howe taught there for three years before being appointed by the Board of Missions of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. to go to China, where he remained for 17 years. He was a co-founder of an elementary school in Dong Kong, a village in the Chekiang Mountains. He left China in 1937 after invading Japanese forces moved into Shanghai. He then entered the commercial chemistry field with the Arthur H. Thomas Company in Philadelphia. He retired in 1965.
        He is survived by his wife, Beatrice; a daughter, Marvine of Manhattan; a son, James 3rd of Norfolk, Va., and two grandchildren.
