        David L. Golomb, chairman of the Everlast Sporting Goods Manufacturing Company, a leading maker of boxing equipment, and a board member of several Jewish organizations, died on Friday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 74. Mr. Golomb had lived in Port Washington, L.I., for 35 years before moving to his native Manhattan in 1982.
        The cause was heart failure, said a son, Hank Golomb.
        After serving in the Army in World War II, Mr. Golomb went to work at Everlast, which his father, Jacob J. Golomb, founded in 1912. He became president in 1951 and chairman in 1958. He led his company in the development of protective boxing equipment that became the standard of Olympic competition.
        Mr. Golomb was a board member of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations and the World Union of Progressive Judaism. He also was a director of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion.
        Besides his son Hank, of Riverdale, the Bronx, Mr. Golomb is survived by his wife of 49 years, Betty; two other sons, Rabbi Paul, of the United Jewish Center in Danbury, Conn., and John, of Rocky Hill, N.J.; a brother, Frederick, of Tenafly, N.J., and six grandchildren.
