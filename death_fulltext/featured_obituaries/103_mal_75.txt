        Marco Wachter, designer of a men's wear line for Mondo Inc. of New York, of which he was a founding partner, died last Saturday in Key Biscayne, Fla., where he was on vacation. He was 59 and lived in Manhattan and Florence, Italy.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Ben Greszes, with whom he founded Mondo, an Italian sportswear company, in 1984.
        Mr. Wachter trained for more than 15 years with a European fashion house in New York and helped to build Mondo into an international wholesale business. His designs, noted for their intricate patterns and refined use of colors and textures, were distributed mainly under the Mondo Di Marco label as part of the Mondo Collection in North America, Europe and the Far East.
        A native of Milan, he was brought to this country at age 12.
        He is survived by his wife, Pina Fattorini Wachter; a son, Iacopo, and a daughter, Federica Tuaty, both of Florence; two sisters, Clara Feldman and Regina Nissenbaum, both of Queens, and a brother, Leo, of Milan.
