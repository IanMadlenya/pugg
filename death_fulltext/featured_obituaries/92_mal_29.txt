        James F. Jacobs, a dancer and interior designer, died on Saturday at Cabrini Medical Center. He was 42 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was AIDS, said Annabella Gonzalez, a friend and choreographer with whom Mr. Jacobs danced.
        Mr. Jacobs, a native of Chambersburg, Pa., attended Shippensburg State University in Pennsylvania and the Fashion Institute of Technology and the Parsons School of Design in New York. He appeared with several modern-dance groups and was a featured soloist with the Annabella Gonzalez Dance Theater from 1977 to 1982. As a designer he worked for Karizma East Ltd., the Bratan Corporation and Christina Borg Interiors in New York and for the Egger Emporium in Eschenbach, Switzerland.
        He is survived by his father, Edgar N. Jacobs of Chambersburg; two brothers, John C. Jacobs, also of Chambersburg, and Hugh M. Jacobs of Baltimore, and a sister, Suzanne Packard of Cincinnati.
