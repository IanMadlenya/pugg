        Steve Clark, the 30-year-old guitarist for the heavy-metal rock group Def Leppard, was found dead on Tuesday at his home here, the police said.
        There were no obvious injuries and there was no suspicion of a crime, Scotland Yard said. An autopsy is being conducted.
        He was found on the living room floor at his home on Old Church Street, in the Chelsea district, the police said.
        Def Leppard began in a garage in Sheffield, in northern England, and it received a record contract from Polygram in 1979. A survey in 1989 reported that the band was said to earn $28 million a year.
