        Brother Andrew, who received a Ph.D. in educational psychology from St. John's University, joined the Brothers of the Christian Schools in 1915. He taught in parochial schools in Manhattan, Newburgh and Troy and served as principal for many years at several New York City elementary schools, including St. Cecilia's in Brooklyn, and St. Veronica's, St. Gabriel's, Holy Name and Incarnation, all in Manhattan.
        In 1955, he was assigned to La Salle School in Albany, where he was the principal for 14 years. Then, for health reasons, he was transferred to Mont La Salle school in Napa, Calif. In 1982, he retired to De La Salle Hall.
        There were no immediate survivors.
