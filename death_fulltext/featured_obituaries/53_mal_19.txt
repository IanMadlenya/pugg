        Dr. Bernard Lamport, a scientific researcher who spent half a century as an American expatriate in the Soviet Union before his return to the United States in 1985, died on Saturday at his home in Brooklyn. He was 61 years old.
        He died of colon cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Lamport was 4 years old in 1934 when his parents left New York for the Soviet Union. Although his father worked as a journalist and translator and the family lived a comfortable life, the son always considered himself an American.
        "I grew up in Russia, and I have lived like a Russian," he said in an interview on the eve of his return. "In the yard when I was a little boy my nickname was 'America.' The important thing for me now is to find for myself a feeling of belonging."
        In 1979 he and his Russian wife, Elita, an engineer, had come to New York for a family gathering in Queens. Elita shed her doubts about life in the Unied States and the couple determined to bring their family to America. But arrangements were not easy: as Jews, they had to pretend they wanted to settle in Israel and were required to pay nearly $800 per person to renounce their Soviet citizenship and leave. Considered Himself American
        "I don't know if I'll live better in America than I do here," Dr. Lamport said in an interview before leaving Moscow. "But I have always felt myself to be an American."
        Upon arriving in his native city with his wife, their three daughters and his wife's mother, Dr. Lamport had no difficulty finding a niche. With doctoral degrees in medicine and philosophy he joined the staff of Albert Einstein College of Medicine as an instructor in epidemiology and was active until he became ill earlier this year.
        Elita Lamport died last July.
        Dr. Lamport is survived by his daughters, Dr. Inna Mathias of Quincy, Mass., and Olga Lemberg and Anna Lamport, both of Brooklyn; a sister, Janna Gurevich of Yonkers, and three grandchildren.
