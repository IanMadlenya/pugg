        Horton Marlais Davies, Putnam professor emeritus of religion at Princeton and an author of many books about church history, died on Wednesday at his home in Princeton, N.J. He was 89.
        The death was announced by his family.
        Dr. Davies specialized in the impact of Christianity on the arts. He wrote or edited more than two dozen books, nearly half of which remain in print, including his most important work, ''Worship and Theology in England,'' published in multiple volumes since the 1960's.
        A native of South Wales, Dr. Davies graduated from the University of Edinburgh, receiving an M.A. in English literature in 1937 and a divinity degree in systematic theology in 1940. He also earned a Ph.D. from Oxford in 1943 and a divinity doctorate from the University of South Africa in 1951.
        In World War II he was a Congregational minister in South London. He then served as an educational director of the Y.M.C.A. with the British Army in occupied Europe before being appointed a professor of divinity at Rhodes University in South Africa.
        He was head of the department of church history at Oxford in 1956 when Princeton invited him to help organize a broad new program of graduate study in religion.
        A Guggenheim fellowship in the early 1960's enabled Dr. Davies to pursue the voluminous ''Worship and Theology in England'' project.
        He took emeritus status at Princeton in 1984.
        Dr. Davies's first marriage, to the former Brenda Deakin, ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife of 31 years, Dr. Marie-Hélène Davies, co-author with him of two books. He is also survived by a daughter, Christine Pisani of Tarrytown, N.Y.; two sons, Dr. Hugh M. of La Jolla, Calif., and Philip M. of Gloucester, Mass.; a sister, Gloria Scott of Dorset, England; a brother, Michael, of Portugal; and five grandchildren.
