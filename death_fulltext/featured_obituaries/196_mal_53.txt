        Dr. Daniel George Miller, a cancer researcher and president emeritus of the Strang Cancer Prevention Center, died on May 7 at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 78 and lived in Scarsdale, N.Y.
        The cause was bone-marrow disease, his family said.
        Dr. Miller was known for his work on genetic susceptibility to cancer and the environmental risk factors likely to affect it. His research supplied data showing how diminished capacity to repair DNA damage increased such susceptibility to cancer. From 1969 to 1995 he was director of the Strang Center, which is affiliated with Rockefeller University and Weill Medical College of Cornell University, where he was a professor of medicine. He also had a long association with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and its lymphoma clinic.
        He was born in Brooklyn, graduated from Colgate University in 1945 and received his medical degree at the University of Buffalo in 1948. He continued his training at Memorial Hospital (later called Memorial Sloan-Kettering), the University of Texas Medical School in Galveston, Tex., and the Pasteur Institute in Paris before being appointed a research associate in clinical chemotherapy at Memorial Sloan-Kettering in 1957. After serving as president, he remained vice president of the board at Strang Center until 2001. He was the founding president of the American Society of Preventive Oncology and founder of the Israel Cancer Association USA.
        Dr. Miller is survived by his wife of 49 years, Helene Wasserman Miller; two daughters, Valerie Miller of Ardmore, Pa., and Faith Miller of Rye, N.Y.; two sons, Dr. Theodore T., of Mamaroneck, N.Y., and Noah, of Queens; a sister, Shirley Cherches of Port Jefferson, N.Y.; and nine grandchildren.
