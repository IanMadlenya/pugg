        Paul Khan, a consultant on food safety and regulatory compliance, died on April 21 at Sound Shore Hospital in New Rochelle, N.Y. A New Rochelle resident, he was 73.
        A colleague, Robert L. Morris, said Mr. Khan was thought to have died of a heart attack.
        At his death, Mr. Khan was president of Regu-Tech Associates of Mamaroneck, N.Y., a consulting firm he founded in 1985. His consultancy focused on regulatory compliance and quality controls in the fields of food safety, medical devices and water purification.
        He spent much of his career with the Continental Baking Company while it was a division of ITT and, later, Ralston Purina. He joined Continental Baking in 1962, and became a vice president for quality and food protection before establishing his own firm.
        Mr. Khan was born in Vienna and came to the United States in 1939. He graduated in chemistry and biology from New York University and received a Master of Science degree in microbiology and parasitology from the University of Chicago.
        He is survived by his wife of 46 years, Grace Adams Khan.
