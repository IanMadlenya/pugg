He was named deputy director of the Center for Labor-Management Studies at the Graduate School when it was created in 1988.
        He was born in Los Angeles and graduated in 1960 from the University of Oregon, where he also received an M.A. degree and a Ph.D.
        In addition to his son, Dr. Styskal is survived by his wife, the former Betsy Lee; a sister, Janis Valluzzo of Bellevue, Wash., and two brothers, Paul, of Gualala, Calif., and Anthony, of Bloomfield, Calif.
