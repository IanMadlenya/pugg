        Yusuke Suga, a Japanese hair stylist who was well known in New York fashion circles, died on Thursday in Tokyo. He was 47 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Suga, as he was known professionally, died of cancer, his business partner, Sandy Varga said.
        Born in China, Suga came to the United States in 1965 and was a stylist at the Kenneth Salon in Manhattan for several years, before leaving to work on his own.
        He gained recognition for his high-fashion hair styling for such magazines as Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and Cosmopolitan. In 1972, he opened his own salon on East 70th Street and created the ''wedge'' haircut worn by the skater Dorothy Hamill in the Olympics. His clients included Candice Bergen, Lauren Hutton, Faye Dunaway and the designer Hanae Mori.
        In 1981 he opened the Suga Salon on East 57th Street, which will continue to operate, Ms. Varga said.
        He is survived by his mother, Sakiyo Suga, two sisters, Yasuko Katsuki and Tamiko Takahashi, and a brother, Hajime Suga, all of Tokyo.
