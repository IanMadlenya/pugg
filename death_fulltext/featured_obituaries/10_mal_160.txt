        James T. McShane, a former F.B.I. agent who helped in the Federal investigations into the conduct of Hamilton Jordan, the former Presidential aide, and Raymond J. Donovan, the former Secretary of Labor, died Friday at the Hospital of Saint Raphael in New Haven after a long illness. He was 64 years old and lived in Madison, Conn.
        Mr. McShane had been president of Bray Protective Consultants in Manhattan since retiring from the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1977 after 27 years of service. He also was security representative for the National Football League.
