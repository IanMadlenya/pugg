        William B. St. John, who supervised major business ventures in Latin America for the billionaire Daniel K. Ludwig, died on Wednesday at Laurel Lake retirement community in Hudson, Ohio. He was 84 years old.
        Mr. St. John, who had moved to Ohio from Old Greenwich, Conn., died of heart failure, his family said.
        His work for Mr. Ludwig's National Bulk Carriers took him to far-flung sites from Alaska to Honduras, Brazil and the Galapagos Islands. Among his projects were developing a 400,000-acre cattle ranch in Venezuela, building the Princess Hotel in Acapulco, Mexico, and operating salt mines and flats in Baja California, Mexico.
        Born in Manhattan, Mr. St. John attended Rice University in Houston. He worked 19 years for W. R. Grace & Company., including three years in Colombia. He worked for National Bulk, helping diversify its oil tanker operations, from 1946 to 1972. Then he was a consultant to Englehardt Mining and Minerals and other companies.
        He is survived by his wife, Kathleen O'Connell St. John; two brothers, Edward San Giovanni of Ridgefield, Conn., and Donald St. John of Whitestone, Va.; a sister, Harriet Eklund of Monsey, N.Y.; two sons, William B. Jr., of Stow, Ohio, and Jay, of Winter Park, Fla., and a daughter, Kathleen St. John Feder of New York City.
