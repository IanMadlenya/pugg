        Robert Goulding Jr., an entomologist whose research into time-release pesticides led to the introduction of the flea collar in 1964, died of a heart attack Friday at a hospital in Corvallis. He was 70 years old.
        Dr. Goulding, a professor at Oregon State University from 1955 until his retirement in 1981, placed time-released pesticides on resin to develop the collar now worn by millions of dogs and cats.
        He also developed a pesticide-filled bag to control insects in cattle yards. The bag is placed on cattle, which release its contents when they scratch themselves by rubbing up against objects.
        Survivors include his wife, May.
