        Samuel Berman, a Brooklyn Democratic district leader and former New York State Assemblyman, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 80 years old and lived in Brooklyn.
        He died of a heart attack, said his daughter, Arlene Brody of Stamford, Conn.
        Mr. Berman attended the City College of New York and became involved in Democratic politics at an early age. He served in the New York State Assembly from 1954 to 1962. He did not seek re-election in order to concentrate on running for district leader, a race he lost.
        Mr. Berman was executive director of the City Council's committee on reapportionment and was secretary to the city's Department of Markets before being elected to the Assembly. Afterward, he served as deputy commissioner of public works in New York City and was on the staffs of joint legislative committees studying alcohol beverage control laws and public health. In 1967 he was appointed to the New York State Lottery Commission. He retired in 1974.
        Besides his daughter, he is survived by his wife, the former Mollie Shainman; a son, Eugene, of Huntington, L.I., and four grandchildren.
