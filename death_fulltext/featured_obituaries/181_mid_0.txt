        Traudl Junge, a private secretary to Hitler who was the last surviving witness to the Nazi leader's final moments in his Berlin bunker, died in Munich on Sunday night. She was 82.
        Her memoirs on the three years she worked for Hitler were published last week and a documentary film, ''Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary,'' based on recent interviews with her, had its premiere at the Berlin Film Festival on the night of her death.
        In her memoirs, mostly written shortly after the war, she wrote that Hitler, ''gave me a feeling of security, safety, and being cared for.''
        The book describes one of his last acts, when he called her to take down his will. According to her, he said, ''I have something to dictate to you.'' She wrote that she was shocked at the words, ''The Jews are guilty.''
        She expressed remorse for her uncritical devotion to Hitler.
        ''Sometimes I think if I had the chance to meet Hitler again, I would ask him if he discovered he had Jewish blood in his family tree, would he have gassed himself?'' she said in the film.
