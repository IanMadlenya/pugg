        William Crawford Eddy, an engineer who developed television transmission and helped to establish Chicago's first television station, died at his home in Michigan City on Saturday after a long illness. He was 87 years old.
        Mr. Eddy met Philo Farnsworth in 1936 in Philadelphia while Mr. Farnsworth, the electronics pioneer, was beginning experiments in the transmission of television pictures.
        In a two-year period, the Farnsworth team, including Mr. Eddy, developed what is known as the sawtooth scanning television transmission.
        Mr. Eddy later went to work for RCA, creating special effects and lighting for early telecasting. In 1941 he helped set up the Chicago station WBKB-TV, handling all aspects of the business.
        A graduate of the United States Naval Academy, Mr. Eddy returned to duty in World War II. A captain, he commanded a radio and radar school in Chicago.
        He is survived by a son and a daughter.
