        Elizabeth Karlin, a Wisconsin doctor, advocate of women's rights and head of a clinic in Madison that was a target of abortion foes, died on July 27 at her home in nearby Arena. She was 54.
        The cause was a brain tumor diagnosed a few months ago, her family said.
        A native New Yorker, Dr. Karlin graduated from Bronx High School of Science and Antioch College. She received her medical degree at the University of Wisconsin and became an internist specializing in endocrinology.
        She worked as a general practitioner in Tanzania before settling in Madison with a practice in internal medicine. She began to provide abortions in the 1980's even as more and more doctors refused to do so because of the actions of opponents.
        Until her illness was diagnosed, she directed the Women's Medical Center on Madison's West Side. She was an outspoken champion of women's rights to self-determination.
        ''I provide a full range of women's medical care and counseling to women who largely have no other access to health care,'' she wrote in a letter to the editor of The New York Times in 1995, ''yet I am forced to wear a bulletproof vest, to outwit my harassers and to hire security to protect my clinic and staff. My job is to offer nurturing medical care to the women who least expect kindness, excellence or even cleanliness.''
        Such caring and respect, she concluded, would actually serve to decrease the number of abortions in the country in the long run.
        Dr. Karlin is survived by her daughter, Jessica Feierman of Philadelphia; a son, Joshua Feierman of New York City; and her mother, Rosa Karlin of Madison. Her marriage to Steven Feierman of Philadelphia ended in divorce.
