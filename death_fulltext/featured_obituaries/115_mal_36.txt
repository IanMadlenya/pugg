        Bernard Rabinowitz, a retired New Jersey manufacturer who was active for decades in civic affairs, particularly in the field of health care, died Aug. 5 at his home in Nutley, N.J. He was 73.
        The cause was non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, his family said.
        At his death, Mr. Rabinowitz was chairman of United Healthcare System of Newark. He also was active in several other health-care task forces and public committees, as well as in the Democratic Party as an Essex County freeholder.
        Born in Passaic, he received a degree in chemical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, class of '44. The class's education was interrupted by World War II, and Mr. Rabinowitz received his degree in 1946 after service as a lieutenant in a mortar battalion of the Third Army in Europe, including the Battle of the Bulge.
        A few years later, he and his brother, Rubin, started a small chemical company that grew into one of the country's largest makers of dye stuffs, Atlantic Industries of Nutley. Mr. Rabinowitz retired in 1988 as president and chief executive after the company was sold.
        He then devoted himself full time to health-care matters and his other civic interests, which included M.I.T. Over the years he worked on the Citizens Commission on AIDS in New York and New Jersey, the New Jersey State Health Coordinating Council and the New Jersey Council on Aging, among others.
        Mr. Rabinowitz is survived by his wife of 48 years, Ann Kubie Rabinowitz; two sons, Daniel L., of Manhattan, and John B., of Cambridge, Mass.; two daughters, Rebecca S. Rabinowitz of Phoenix, Ariz., and Sarah J. Rabinowitz of Barnegat, N.J., and his brother, Rubin, of Clifton, N.J.
