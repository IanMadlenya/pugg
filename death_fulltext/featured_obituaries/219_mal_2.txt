        Nathanael V. Davis, an industrialist and philanthropist who led the world's second-largest supplier of aluminum, Alcan, after World War II and through the 1970's, died on March 22 at his home in Boca Grande, Fla. He was 89.
        His death was announced by his son, J.H. Dow Davis.
        As Alcan's president and chief executive from 1947 to 1979, Mr. Davis provided a second generation of family leadership in North America's aluminum industry, which his uncle, Arthur Vining Davis, largely established by founding Alcoa in 1886.
        Aluminium Ltd., an offshoot of Alcoa and the parent company of Alcan, was organized by his father, Edward K. Davis, in 1928, and has been fully independent since 1951.
        The younger Mr. Davis led the company in building hydroelectric generators in British Columbia and Quebec, making it the only aluminum company with its own power source and the largest nonutility producer of electricity.
        It became the world's leading aluminum exporter, operating in close to 35 countries and employing 63,000 people by the time he retired in 1979.
        Mr. Davis was also chairman for 30 years of the Arthur Vining Davis Foundations, a philanthropic organization that provides assistance to educational, cultural, scientific and religious institutions.
        Mr. Davis was born in Pittsburgh on June 26, 1915. He graduated from Harvard in 1938 and studied at the London School of Economics. During World War II, he served as an intelligence officer with the Navy.
        In addition to his son, of Weston, Mass., he is survived by his wife of 63 years, Lois Thompson Davis; a daughter, Katharine Davis Cote, of Osterville, Mass.; seven grandchildren; and a great-grandchild.
