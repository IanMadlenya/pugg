        Clyde G. Culbertson, a medical educator and researcher who developed a process that enabled the Salk polio vaccine to be mass-produced, died on Wednesday at a nursing home in Columbus, Ind. He was 89.
        The cause was cancer, said Dr. James W. Smith, a colleague at Indiana University, where Dr. Culbertson was affiliated for 70 years.
        Dr. Culbertson helped oversee the development of vaccines and drugs in his 25 years at Eli Lilly & Company in Indianapolis, where he became the director of biological research. Besides his contribution to the Salk vaccine, he helped develop a safer rabies vaccine and the antibiotic erythromycin, Dr. Smith said.
        Dr. Culbertson, who was president of the American Society of Clinical Pathologists and a founding fellow of the College of American Pathologists, continued his laboratory work until a year ago. Among his discoveries was that nonparasitic amoeba can fatally infect the brains of humans. One species, Acanthamoeba culbertsoni, was named for him.
        After receiving his undergraduate and medical degrees from Indiana University, he stayed on to create clinical laboratories and become a professor and chairman of clinical pathology.
        His first and second wives, Margaret O'Neal and Catherine Warren Culbertson, are deceased. There are no immediate survivors.
