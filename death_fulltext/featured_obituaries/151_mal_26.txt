        Jack Laskowski, an international vice president of the United Auto Workers who was in charge of negotiations with the DaimlerChrysler Corporation, died on Sunday in Lewiston, Mich. He was 59 and lived in Canton, Mich.
        The cause was a heart attack, a spokesman for the union, Roger Kerson, said.
        Mr. Laskowski and Tom Gallagher, DaimlerChrysler's negotiator, had been holding talks this summer on wages and working conditions for the 75,000 hourly union members employed by the auto maker. The talks were focused on a national contract to replace one that expires on Sept. 14.
        Mr. Laskowski became vice president of the union in 1995 and was elected one of its five international vice presidents in 1998.
        He oversaw negotiations with the former Chrysler Corporation in the last round of national bargaining in 1996.
        Mr. Laskowski also served on the board of directors of Navistar Inc. and Delta Dental of Michigan; he was attending a Delta Dental board meeting when he was stricken.
        Jack Laskowski was born on April 8, 1940, in Bay City, Mich., a son of an auto worker. He attended Bay City Junior College and Alma College. He joined the union in 1958 when he went to work on the assembly line at the General Motors plant in Bay City.
        He is survived by his wife, Sally; three sons, Greg, of Los Angeles, Tim, of Kalamazoo, Mich., and Mike,  of Adrian, Mich.; three brothers, Al,  of Bay City, Tom, of Auburn, Mich., and Terry, of Bay City, and two sisters, Germaine O'Daniel of Fort Wayne, Ind., and Clara Strzelecki of Bay City.
