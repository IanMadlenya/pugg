        Howard Evans Galley Jr., author and editor of Episcopal liturgical works, died yesterday at Christ Hospital in Jersey City. He was 64 and lived in Jersey City.
        The cause was pneumonia and complications from emphysema and lung cancer, said Lois Pagliaro, a deacon of the Church of St. Luke in the Fields in Manhattan, where Mr. Galley was a parishioner.
        He was appointed assistant to the coordinator for prayer book revision for the national Episcopal Church in 1969 and was the working editor of the 1979 Book of Common Prayer, an edition currently used in Episcopal churches around the country.
        His best-known work is "The Ceremonies of the Eucharist: A Guide to Celebration," (Cowley Publications, 1989), which is widely used by the Episcopal Church. He also produced the 1981 revision of "White & Dykman," the annotated constitution and canons for the government of the Episcopal Church.
        A freelance editor, he worked primarily for the Morehouse Publishing Group in Harrisburg, Pa.
        From 1955 to 1980, Mr. Galley was an active member of the Church Army, an evangelical and mission organization of the Episcopal Church, based in Beaver Falls, Pa.
        He was born in Lawrence, Mass. He was a graduate of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and received a master's degree in educational psychology from New York University in 1964.
        Survivors include his mother, Viola M. Galley, and a brother, Charles, both of Andover, Mass.; a sister, Jane Connors of Enosburg Falls, Vt., and two companions, Robert Gillespie and Albert Rockenstein, of Jersey City.
