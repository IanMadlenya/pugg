        Wallace Hoggson, a retired business executive and a decorated World War I pilot, died on Monday at a nursing home in Sarasota, Fla. He was 95 years old and lived nearby in Nokomis, Fla.
        He died of pneumonia, his family said.
        For many years Mr. Hoggson worked as an investment banker for Bankers Trust in Manhattan and later as a broker for the Travelers Insurance Company. He retired in the early 1960's.
        He was born in Manhattan and grew up in Greenwich, Conn. He dropped out of Yale University to fight in World War I. He won decorations from the Italians and French as well as the United States, including the Croix de Guerre and Distinguished Flying Cross.
        His wife of 42 years, the former Josephine Van Siclen, died in 1974.
        He is survived by two sons, Wallace Jr., of Manhattan, and John M., of Tega Cay, S.C.; a daughter, Barbara Sutphen of Summit, N.J.; eight grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.
        Correction:  November 13, 1992, Friday
        An obituary yesterday about Wallace Hoggson, a retired businessman and a decorated World War I pilot, misidentified his wife, to whom he had been married for 42 years at her death in 1974. She was the former Cornelia Van Siclen.
