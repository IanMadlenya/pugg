        The Rev. Nicholas J. Langenfeld, a retired professor of social welfare at Fordham University, died Thursday at the Jesuit Infirmary at the university's campus in the Bronx. Father Langenfeld, who lived in Manhattan, was 93.
        The cause was cardiac arrest, said Linda Sollars, a cousin.
        Father Langenfeld began his tenure at Fordham in 1934, teaching a course in social work and religion. He retired in 1967. In 1983 the university established the Rev. Dr. Nicholas J. Langenfeld Chair in Social Research.
        He graduated from St. Lawrence College in Mount Calvary, Wis., in 1922 and was ordained in Green Bay, Wis., in 1926. He received a doctorate from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome in 1931.
        He is survived by a sister, Rose Feldner of Milwaukee.
