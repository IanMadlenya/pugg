        Representative John J. Duncan, who served 24 years in the House of Representatives and was the ranking Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, died Tuesday after a long battle with cancer. He was 69 years old.
        Mr. Duncan died at St. Mary's Medical Center five days after being admitted for chemotherapy, according to a hospital spokeswoman, Mary Sharp.
        Mr. Duncan, who consistently won re-election by large margins in Tennessee's Second Congressional District, had planned to run again. But on May 27 he announced that he would not seek another term because of poor health. Son Runs for Seat
        His 40-year-old son, John Jr., stepped down as a judge in Knox County Criminal Court to run for his father's Congressional seat in the Republican primary in August.
        Mr. Duncan received a law degree in 1948. From then until 1956 he was an assistant state attorney general. In 1959, he was elected Mayor of Knoxville, serving until he was elected to Congress in 1964.
        He became the ranking Republican on the Ways and Means Committee after his re-election in 1984, and he was one of two Republicans on the Joint Taxation Committee.
        Survivors include his wife, Lois, and four children.
