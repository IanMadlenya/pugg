        He died of prostate cancer, his family said.

        He was previously married and divorced. Surviving are his wife of 13 years, the former Kittie Smith; a son, Ronald C. Jones, of Ossining, N.Y.; four daughters, Linda and Alison Jones, both of Darien, Conn., and Louisa and Mamie Stevenson, both of Southport; a sister, Margaret Bruning, of Terre Haute, Ind., and six grandchildren.
