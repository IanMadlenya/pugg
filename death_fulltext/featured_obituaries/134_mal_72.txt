        Peter L. Feller, a Tony Award-winning builder of sets for Broadway shows, died on March 13 at Holmes Regional Hospital in Melbourne, Fla. He was 78 and lived in Melbourne.
        The cause was a heart-related illness, his family said.
        Mr. Feller, the son of a master carpenter who also worked on Broadway, collaborated with most of the leading scenic designers of the last 50 years, including Oliver Smith, Boris Aronson, Jo Mielziner, Ming Cho Lee and John Lee Beatty. He was sought out by producers including George Abbott, Hal Prince and Cameron Mackintosh.
        In 1952, Mr. Feller won a Tony for his work on ''Call Me Madam,'' which starred Ethel Merman. In 1984, he received a Tony for lifetime achievement in the theater. Among the shows he worked on were ''Fiddler on the Roof,'' ''West Side Story,'' ''Fiorello!,'' ''Cabaret,'' ''Sweeney Todd'' and ''Cats.'' He also built the set for the 1989 musical ''Jerome Robbins' Broadway.'' He was born in New York City, and began his career in the Army in World War II, when Irving Berlin chose him to build the scenery for the wartime musical ''This Is the Army.''
        He is survived by his wife, Katherine; two sons, Peter, of Palisades, N.Y., and Philip, of Yonkers; two sisters, Dr. Elizabeth Feller of Melbourne and Dorothy Lohmann of Keene, N.H., and three granddaughters.
