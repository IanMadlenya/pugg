        Mr. Livingston, whose name was originally Jerry Levinson, was born in Denver. He studed music at the University of Arizona and wrote his first score for a college musical. He came to New York in the 1930's and played piano in dance orchestras.
        He wrote for a number of Broadway revues, including ''Hollywood Revels'' and ''Bright Lights of '44.'' In 1949 he moved to Hollywood, and was active through the 1970's in movies and television. He wrote themes for ''77 Sunset Strip,'' ''The Bugs Bunny Show'' and ''Hawaiian Eye.'' His song ''Bibbidy Bobbidy Boo'' (from Walt Disney's ''Cinderella'') and his scores for ''Cat Ballou'' and ''The Hanging Tree'' were nominated for Academy Awards.
        In 1973 he wrote songs for a Broadway musical, ''Molly,'' with lyrics by Leonard Adelson and Mack David. His other collaborators during his career included Al Hoffman, Mitchell Parish, Mann Curtis and Milton Berle.
        Mr. Livingston was a president of the Songwriters Guild of America, and in 1981 he was inducted into the National Academy of Popular Music's Songwriters Hall of Fame.
        He is survived by his wife, Ruth, and a son, Dennis.
