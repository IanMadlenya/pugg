        Lewis Veraldi, a retired Ford Motor Company executive who helped create the futuristic look of the Taurus and Mercury Sable, died of a heart attack Saturday at William Beaumont Hospital. He was 60 years old.
        As vice president of advanced vehicle development Mr. Veraldi helped Ford more than double its share of the mid-size auto market.
        The aerodynamic Taurus and Mercury Sable, introduced in 1985, made inroads in the sales of General Motors Corporation.
        Mr. Veraldi, who began at Ford in 1949, brought together Ford's design, engineering and manufacturing staffs in a five-year, $3 billion program to build the Taurus. He retired in 1989.
        He is survived by his wife, Irene; three daughters, two sons and six grandchildren.
