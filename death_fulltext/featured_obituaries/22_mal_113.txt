        Dr. Charles Fisher, a psychoanalyst noted for his research in the field of sleep and dreaming, died of heart failure Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 80 years old.
        In his laboratory at Mount Sinai Hospital, Dr. Fisher investigated the physiological and psychological manifestations of dreams during sleep and was credited with illuminating the significance of REM, or rapid eye movement, periods of light sleep when most dreams occur.
        A native of Los Angeles, he received his medical degree from Northwestern University. He served in the United States Public Health Service at Ellis Island during World War II.
        Dr. Fisher was a clinical professor of psychiatry at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine and had an extensive private practice in psychoanalysis. He was a past president of the New York Psychoanalytic Society and Institute.
        He is survived by his wife, Betty Krowech; two daughters, Carla Miner and Barbara Williamson, both of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.
