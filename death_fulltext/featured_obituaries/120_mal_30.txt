        Peter Cain, a painter whose images of disturbingly truncated cars contributed to the revival of realism among younger artists, died on Sunday at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center in Greenwich Village. He was 37 and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Cain had been in a coma since Jan. 2, when he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage, said Matthew Marks, whose gallery represented the artist.
        Peter Francis Cain was born in Orange, N.J., in 1959 and studied art in Manhattan at the Parsons School of Design and the School of Visual Arts in the late 1970's and early 80's. He developed a style of painting that borrowed from Surrealism and Pop Art while taking streamlining and customizing to unsettling extremes.
        A frequent motif was a large-scale, meticulously rendered profile of a luxury car minus its passenger compartment: an odd, Cyclops-like fusion of hood, trunk and a single wheel that reduced the automobile's seductiveness to its essence, while giving it an almost human sense of vulnerability and nakedness.
        Mr. Cain had his first solo show at the Daniel Weinberg Gallery in Santa Monica, Calif., in 1990, followed by exhibitions in Manhattan at the Simon Watson Gallery in 1991 and with Mr. Marks in 1992. His paintings were included in the Whitney Museum of American Art's Biennial in 1993 and 1995. An exhibition of new work, which abandons cars for portraits and images of gas stations, is  scheduled to open at Mr. Marks's Chelsea gallery on Feb. 1.
        Mr. Cain is survived by his companion, Sean Leclair of Manhattan; his parents, Jean A. Barry of New Vernon, N.J., and John W. Cain of Brielle, N.J.; a brother, Kevin Cain of Gladstone, N.J.; two sisters, Margaret Hynes of Novato, Calif., and Teresa Sedgwick of Lake Tahoe, Calif.; a half-sister, Mollie Cain of Brielle, and his grandmothers, Florence K. Hackett of Trumbull, Conn., and Helen K. Cain of Kansas City, Mo.
