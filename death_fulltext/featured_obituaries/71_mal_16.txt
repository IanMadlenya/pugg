        Dr. Ira M. Goldstein, one of the country's foremost rheumatologists, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. He was 50 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of metastatic lung cancer, the center said.
        He was the Murray M. Rosenberg Professor and chairman of the Samuel Bronfman Department of Medicine at the time of his death.
        He gained international recognition for his expertise on inflammation, the process by which the body responds to injury. He wrote the definitive "Inflammation, Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates," now in its second edition. Connective Tissue Disorder
        Among his contributions was the identification of patients with a connective tissue disorder called systemic lupus erythematosus (S.L.E.), whose white blood cells lack a structure needed for appropriate immune responses. The defect may hold a clue to the cause of the disease and may one day help to predict who will develop it. S.L.E. can entail long-term, severe swelling affecting many systems of the body.
        A native of Brooklyn and graduate of Brooklyn College, Dr. Goldstein received his M.D. at New York University Medical School. He trained in biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health before joining the N.Y.U. faculty in 1971.
        He moved to the University of California-San Francisco in 1980 as a full professor.
        He also became the director of the Rosalind Russell Medical Research Laboratory for Arthritis and was chief of the center's Rheumatology Service. The Rosalind Russell unit was designated by Congress to honor the actress, who died of severe rheumatoid arthritis in 1976.
        Dr. Goldstein returned to New York this summer to assume his duties at Mount Sinai.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Barbara Kaplan; his children, Michael and Bethany, and a brother, Donald, all of New York City.
