        Edwin E. Huddleson Jr., a lawyer who also acted as counsel for government and other organizations, died on Saturday at the California Pacific Hospital in San Francisco. He was 81 and lived in Oakland, Calif.
        The cause was complications from pneumonia, said his daughter, Katie Huddleson.
        Mr. Huddleson was a director of the nonprofit Rand Corporation for 30 years and was instrumental in founding the New York City Rand Institute, which was created to help analyze New York City's problems, including the cleanup of Jamaica Bay, rent control and the operation of the courts. The city stopped funding for the institute in 1975.
        He also was counsel to the Atomic Energy Commission in its early days.
        After graduating from Harvard Law School in 1938, Mr. Huddleson was a clerk for Judge Augustus N. Hand on the United States Court of Appeals and for United States Supreme Court Justice Frank Murphy.
        After World War II, he was deputy general counsel to the A.E.C. from 1947 to 1949. That year, he became a partner in the San Francisco law firm of Cooley Godward Castro Huddleson & Tatum.
        Mr. Huddleson also served as outside counsel to the Ford Foundation and was a director of a number of corporations and organizations, including the Raychem Corporation and the Center for Advanced Study in the Behaviorial Sciences.
        He was a native of Santa Cruz and received an undergraduate degree from Stanford University in 1935.
        Besides his daughter, who lives in Marblehead, Mass., he is survived by his wife, Demi; a son, Edwin H. Huddleson 3d; a brother, Derrol, of Alameda, Calif., and three grandchildren.
