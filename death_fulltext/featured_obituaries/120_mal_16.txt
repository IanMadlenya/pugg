        Gerald V. Williamson, a St. Louis civic leader and mechanical engineer who joined the battle against air pollution early on, died of heart failure last Saturday at a nursing home in St. Louis. He was 95.
        Mr. Williamson graduated in 1922 with a degree in mechanical engineering from Washington University, where he also qualified as a professional engineer in 1930. By then he had begun a career at Union Electric in St. Louis, rising to vice president for power production and distribution in 1954 and retiring in 1967 as vice president in charge of operations.
        In the early 1930's he worked on novel designs for steam-power plants, including a St. Louis plant that was the first to burn pulverized coal. He devoted the rest of his professional life to the design, operation and maintenance of power plants and worked with super-size boilers, coal-dust abatement, more precise instrumentation and the like to improve efficiency, safety and pollution control.
        He received the Westinghouse Gold Medal in 1961 from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and held leading positions at the Edison Electric Institute. He promoted eduational opportunities in St. Louis as the founding board president of the Community College District and served Washington University's School of Engineering as chairman of the Alumni Fund and of the Chancellor's Committee of 500.
        Mr. Williamson is survived by his wife, Carol Coultas Williamson; two daughters and a son, Cynthia Metcalfe, Daniel Williamson and Marcia Shahan, all of St. Louis, and four grandchildren.
