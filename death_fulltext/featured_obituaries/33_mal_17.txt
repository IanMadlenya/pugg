        Witold Rowicki, who founded the Warsaw National Philharmonic Orchestra and was its conductor for nearly 25 years, died on Sunday, the official Polish press agency reported today. He was 75 years old.
        Mr. Rowicki was born on Feb. 26, 1914, in Taganrog, now part of the Soviet Union, and graduated in 1938 from the Cracow Music Conservatory, where he became a professor of violin.
        During the Nazi occupation, he was a member of the symphony orchestra in Krakow, playing violin and viola. When the war ended, he became head of the music section of Polish Radio in Katowice in southern Poland. There he founded the Polish Radio Orchestra, now the Grand Symphony Orchestra of Polish Radio and Television. Retired in 1977
        In 1950, Mr. moved to Warsaw and founded the National Philharmonic. Except for a three-year leave of absence in the mid-1950s, he served as its artistic director and conductor until relinquishing the position in 1977.
        When the war-ravaged Wielki Teatr, Warsaw's opulent opera, ballet and concert hall, was restored in 1965, Mr. Rowicki conducted the opening performance, the opera ''The Haunted House'' by the Polish composer Stanislaw Moniuszko.
        After his retirement from the Philharmonic, Mr. Rowicki participated in the Wiener Meisterkurse in Vienna, a series of lectures by masters of music.
        Mr. Rowicki was scheduled to appear this month as a guest conductor with the San Francisco Symphony in the United States.
