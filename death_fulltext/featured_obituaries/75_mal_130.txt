        Dr. Oskar Diethelm, professor emeritus at the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, died on April 22 in Lachen, Switzerland. He was 95.
        The cause of death was pneumonia, the center reported.
        He returned to Lachen in January from Bronxville, N.Y., where he had lived. He retired in 1962 after 27 years as chief of the medical center's Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic and chairman of the psychiatry department.
        He trained at the University of Zurich and received his M.D. from the University of Basel in 1923. His early experience in psychiatry came at Johns Hopkins Medical School.
        Dr. Diethelm represented the fourth generation of physicians in the family. A grandchild, Dr. Nancy Elizabeth Diethelm of San Francisco, a radiologist, is the sixth generation.  Wide-Ranging Research
        Dr. Diethelm's research ranged over psychopathology, psychiatric treatment methods, psychosomoatic conditions and social psychiatry. At Cornell, he sponsored the research of Thomas Rennie and Alexander Leighton in social psychiatry and Harold Wolff's studies of psychosomatic pain. Dr. Diethelm also assembled a historical psychiatric library, named in his honor, whose volumes and manuscripts date to the 15th century.
        He was the author of many articles and book chapters, as well as a textbook, "Treatment in Psychiatry." Its first edition appeared in 1936, the year he came to Cornell.
        His first wife, the former Grace Elizabeth Gillespie, died in 1958.
        He is survived by his wife of 31 years, the former Monique Lefebvre de Vivy de Chaves; a daughter by his first marriage, Janet Diethelm Peck of Portland, Ore; a son, Dr. Arnold Gillespie Diethelm of Birmingham, Ala.; six grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.
