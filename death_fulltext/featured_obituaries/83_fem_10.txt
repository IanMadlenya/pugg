        Carlotta Monti, an actress who wrote the 1971 book "W. C. Fields and Me," an account of her role as companion to the comedian for the last 14 years of his life, died on Wednesday at the Motion Picture and Television Fund Hospital in Woodland, Calif., after a long illness. She was 86.
        The cause was Alzheimer's disease, said Al Newman, a spokesman for the hospital.
        Miss Monti's book, written with Cy Rice, was made into a 1976 film directed by Arthur Hiller, which starred Valerie Perrine as Miss Monti and Rod Steiger as Fields, who died in 1946 at the age of 67.
        She is survived by a sister, Eloise Hertford, of San Diego.
