        Richard Croxton Adams, who invented the paint roller 48 years ago, died Wednesday in La Mesa, Calif. He was 76 years old.
        Mr. Adams, a descendant of Presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams, suffered a stroke last week, family members said.
        Mr. Adams, an engineer, industrialist and civic leader, held the first patent on the paint roller. He developed it in his basement workshop in 1940 while working for the Sherwin-Williams Paint Company. The invention was insipred by a shortage of paint brushes caused by World War II.
