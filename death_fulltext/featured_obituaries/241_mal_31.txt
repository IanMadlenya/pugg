        Fred Mustard Stewart, a best-selling writer of popular novels, several of which were adapted for the screen, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 74 and also lived in Washington, Conn.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Joan Stewart.
        Originally trained as a concert pianist, Mr. Stewart drew on this background for his first novel, ''The Mephisto Waltz'' (Coward-McCann), published in 1969. (The publicity materials for the book included a 45-r.p.m. recording of Mr. Stewart playing the title piece, by Liszt.) In 1971, the book became a film with Alan Alda as a young writer whose body is usurped by an aging pianist.
        Mr. Stewart also wrote ''Six Weeks'' (Arbor House, 1976), which became a 1982 film starring Mary Tyler Moore as the mother of a dying daughter. His novel ''Ellis Island'' (Morrow, 1983), a multigenerational narrative of immigrant life, became a CBS mini-series in 1984.
        Mr. Stewart was born on Sept. 17, 1932, in Anderson, Ind., the son of Simeon Stewart, a banker, and the former Janet Mustard. He graduated from Princeton in 1954, and also studied at the Juilliard School with Eduard Steuermann.
        Mr. Stewart is survived by his wife, the former Joan Richardson, whom he married in 1967; and a half-brother, John, of Scottsdale, Ariz.
        Among his other books are ''The Mannings'' (Arbor House, 1973); ''Century'' (Morrow, 1981), which spent six months on The New York Times best-seller list; ''The Titan'' (Simon & Schuster, 1985); and ''The Naked Savages'' (Forge, 1999).
        Though Mr. Stewart's work ranged from horror to science fiction to adventure, he said he most enjoyed writing multi-strand family narratives. ''I love to do saga books, because I love to write about families,'' he told The New York Times in 1981. ''I think it's the best genre to write in, because it's the least restricting. You don't have to depend on one plot device to hold it together. The family holds it together.''
