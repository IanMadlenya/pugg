        William T. Farr, a newspaper reporter who chose to serve 46 days in jail rather than disclose a confidential source, died today at U.C.L.A. Medical Center of complications from pancreatic cancer. He was 52 years old.
        Mr. Farr's legal trouble began in 1970, when he was a reporter for The Los Angeles Herald Examiner covering the murder trial of Charles Manson, who was subsequently convicted in the 1969 slayings of the actress Sharon Tate and six other people.
        Mr. Farr refused to tell Judge Charles Older of Superior Court the source for a news article in which he disclosed grand jury testimony that members of the Manson ''family'' had planned to murder such celebrities as Elizabeth Taylor and Frank Sinatra.
        Mr. Farr cited a California law protecting reporters from having to disclose such sources. When he stepped from behind the reporter's legal shield to take a job as a spokesman for then-District Attorney Joseph Busch, Judge Older demanded that Mr. Farr disclose his sources for the Manson article. He refused, and the judge ordered him jailed for contempt.
        Mr. Farr spent Christmas 1972 in jail but was ordered released by Associate Justice William O. Douglas of the Supreme Court pending consideration of the case by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
        The contempt citation was eventually allowed to stand, and Mr. Farr was ordered to serve five days in jail.
        Mr. Farr, who worked for The Los Angeles Times at his death, is survived by his wife, Nancy, and two sons.
