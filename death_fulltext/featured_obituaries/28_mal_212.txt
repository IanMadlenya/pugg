        Professor Homans served on the Harvard faculty from 1946 to 1980, when he retired. He studied the social behavior of small groups and chronicled it in several books.
        ''I have tried to show that the characteristics of social behavior may be explained by general propositions about the behavior of individual human beings, rather than by propositions about groups as such,'' he wrote. ''All collective behavior is the resultant of individual behavior.''
        Born in Boston, Professor Homans was descended from two Presidents, John Adams and John Quincy Adams. He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard College and earned a master's degree from Cambridge University in England. He served as chairman of Harvard's sociology department and as associate dean for undergraduate education. He was a Ford Foundation Fellow at Harvard's Graduate School of Business Administration.
        Among his books are ''Sentiments and Activities: Essays in Social Science,'' published by Free Press of Glencoe; ''The Human Group,'' published by Harcourt, Brace and ''An Introduction to Pareto: His Sociology,'' published by Alfred A. Knopf.
        He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society. He was a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University in 1958.
        Surviving are his wife, Nancy; a son, Peter, of New York City; two daughters, Elizabeth, of Providence, R.I., and Susan Elias, of Philadelphia, and four grandchildren.
