        Alan F. McHenry, president and treasurer of the Richard Lounsbery Foundation of Manhattan, which is devoted primarily to biomedical research, died on Friday in Cold Spring, N.Y. He was 78.
        The cause was heart failure, the foundation said.
        Mr. McHenry, a lawyer, lived in Garrison, N.Y.
        He was trained during World War II as an intelligence officer and was assigned to Pyongyang, Korea. After the war he received a bachelor's degree from New York University and a law degree from Yale Law School in 1950.
        He practiced law in New York City from 1956 to 1980, the year he became president of the Richard Lounsbery Foundation, which was created in 1959 under a Lounsbery family trust. Mr. McHenry was executor of the trust and a family friend.
        The philanthropy listed assets of $14,975,000 in 1990. Its work also reflected Mr. Lounsbery's interest in promoting good relations with France.
        Mr. McHenry is survived by his wife, Claudine Tavel, and two sons, Bruce Alan Charles of La Honda, Calif., and Richard Edward John of Vail, Colo.
