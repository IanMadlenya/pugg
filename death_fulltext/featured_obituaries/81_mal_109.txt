        Kent E. Jones, an administrator at Mount Sinai Medical Center and an oboist who had played with the New Amsterdam Symphony Orchestra and the Colorado Philharmonic Orchestra, died at Mount Sinai on Oct. 15. He was 34.
        The cause was complications from AIDS, said his companion, Peter Rossi.
        Mr. Jones was trained as a musician, with a degree in performance in 1981 from the Oberlin Conservatory and another in 1983 from the Yale University School of Music.
        He performed for two seasons with the Colorado Philharmonic Orchestra.
        While working as a member of the nursing administrative staff at Mount Sinai, which he joined in 1989, he performed with a number of ensembles in the New York area, including the New Amsterdam Symphony Orchestra, where he was principal oboist.
        In addition to his companion, he is survived by his parents, Morton and Pat, of Richardson, Tex.; a sister, Shelley Smith of West Columbia, Tex., and two brothers, Stephen of Fort Worth and Jay of Austin.
