        Dr. Edward Allen Mason, a chemical physicist known for his work with intermolecular forces, died last Thursday at his home in Barrington, R.I. He was 68.
        The cause was prostate cancer, said a spokeswoman for Brown University, where Dr. Mason was the Newport Rogers Professor of Chemistry Emeritus.
        Dr. Mason, the author of 336 works, contributed to the theory of transport phenomena, especially the thermal conductivity of molecular masses. That work resulted in a quantitative treatment of gas transport in porous media that has come into widespread use in engineering practices.
        He taught at the University of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania State University and the University of Maryland, where he was head of the Institute for Molecular Physics. He joined the Brown faculty in 1967.
        Dr. Mason is survived by his wife, Ann Laufman Mason; three daughters, Catherine Mason of Melrose, Mass., Elizabeth Mason of Sheridan, Wyo., and Sarah Mason of New Boston, N.H.; a son, Stephen, of Big Bend, Tex.; and four grandchildren.
