        Samuel R. Rosenthal, a Chicago lawyer and philanthropist, died on Tuesday at his home in Chicago. He was 95.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Larry Mandel, the chapel manager at Furth Funeral Direction in Chicago.
        At his death, Mr. Rosenthal was a senior partner in the Chicago-based law firm of Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal. He was known mainly for work in trust and estate law.
        Mr. Rosenthal and his wife, the former Marie-Louise Dreyfus, financed a gallery at the Art Institute of Chicago. The Rosenthal gallery opened in 1992 and has been used for displaying 19th century sculpture.
        Other beneficiaries included the Harvard Law School, where the Samuel R. Rosenthal Professorship of Law is named in Mr. Rosenthal's honor.
        Mr. Rosenthal was born in Manistique, Mich., served in the Army in World War I and earned an A.B. in 1921 from the University of Michigan and a law degree in 1924 from Harvard. He went to work at the Sonnenschein firm in 1926 and became a partner there in 1937.
        In addition to his wife of 62 years, he is survived by a daughter, Louise Glasser of Lake Forest, Ill., and seven grandchildren.
