        Seichi Konzo, whose research on home air-conditioning systems predated their commercial debut by almost two decades, died Sunday at Covenant Medical Center in Urbana, Ill., his hometown. He was 87 years old.
        He died after a brief illness, said officials of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he was professor emeritus of mechanical engineering.
        Professor Konzo, who was born in Tacoma, Wash., graduated from the University of Washington and earned an M.S. degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Illinois in 1929, the year he joined its faculty. During his first 18 years on the Illinois campus he did research on home air-conditioning, combustion of fuels and heating as part of the university's Residential Heating and Cooling Project, begun in the 1920's.
        University officials said the Konzo family moved into North America's first air-conditioned home in 1933. Professor Konzo was also known for his research on forced warm-air heating. He retired in 1971.
        He was the author or co-author of more than 100 technical papers and books. His latest book, written with Marylee MacDonald, was "The Quiet Indoor Revolution," published this year by the University of Illinois Press. The volume is a history of the heating and cooling industry.
        He is survived by his wife of 60 years, the former Kimi Furuya; two daughters, Margaret K. Wolf of Fort Collins, Colo., and Janice L. Rideg of San Diego, and two granddaughters.
