        Emil Synek, a Czech author and playwright who opposed Hitler and Communism, died on April 12 at the Hopital Bichat in Paris. He was 89 and lived in exile in Paris since 1947.
        He died after a brief illness, said F. Malcolm Graff Jr., his son-in-law, in New York.
        Mr. Synek, who was born in Prague, graduated from the Sorbonne and received a doctorate of law from Charles University in Prague in 1926. His first play was staged at the National Theater in Prague when he was 24 years old. He wrote more than 20 plays and won a national literary prize in 1934. He also wrote novels and biographies and directed films at the Barandov studios in Prague.
        He turned to political journalism and opposed the Hitler regime. He then fled to France and fought with the Czech militia until he was evacuated to Dunkirk. In London, he joined the exile government of Eduard Benes.
        At the end of the war he returned home briefly and won a second national prize for his novel about the war years, "The Running Shadow." But fearful of a Communist takeover, he moved his family to Paris. In the cold war period he wrote analyses of Soviet affairs until retiring in 1973.
        Mr. Synek is survived by his second wife, Helena Janatkova; his daughter, Yveta Synek Graff of Manhattan, and two grandsons.
