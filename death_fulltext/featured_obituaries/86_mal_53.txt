        Declan Haun, a photojournalist in Washington whose coverage of the civil rights movement in the 1960's gained national attention, died on Monday at the Hospice of Washington. He was 56.
        The cause was throat cancer, said his son Werner.
        In his 35-year career as a photographer, Mr. Haun worked for many national publications, including Time, Life, Newsweek and the National Geographic Magazine. He also produced documentary films and edited books of photographs. In 1990 he founded Odyssey Communications, which produces news and photographic material for books and publications.
        In addition to his son Werner, of Washington, he is survived by another son, Erich, of Chicago; two daughters, Winifred Haun of Chicago and Evelyn Zuroske of Rockford, Ill.; his father, Charles, of Detroit; a sister, Madryn Johnson of New Baltimore, Mich., and a brother, Edwin, of Detroit.
