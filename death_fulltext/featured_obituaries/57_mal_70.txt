        Davis Pratt, the associate curator of photographs at the Fogg Art Museum of Harvard University and a senior lecturer on fine arts at the university, died on Monday in Cambridge, Mass. He was 68 years old.
        He died of cancer, said his son, Samuel.
        Mr. Pratt had held his position at the Fogg since 1971, and was instrumental in the development of the museum's photography collection. He taught the history of photography at the university for many years, and was the author of "The Photographic Eye of Ben Shahn" (1975).
        In 1962 Mr. Pratt worked as a special assistant under Edward Steichen in the photography department of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, where he carried out picture research for "The Bitter Years," the first major survey of work by the photographers of the Depression-era Farm Security Administration. From 1966 to 1971 Mr. Pratt served as curator of still photography at the Carpenter Center of the Visual Arts at Harvard.
        In addition to his son, of New Canaan, Conn., Mr. Pratt is survived by two brothers, two sisters, two half-brothers and his stepmother.
