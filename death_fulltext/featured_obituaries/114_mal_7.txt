        Bert Terborgh, a principal dancer and a rehearsal director with the Martha Graham Dance Company and a teacher at the State University of New York at Purchase, died on June 21 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan.  He was 51 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was AIDS, said Carol Walker, dean of the dance division at Purchase.
        A performer who stood out for the warmth and intensity of his contact with the audience and with other dancers on the stage, Mr. Terborgh began his dance training in the Netherlands, where he was born and where he studied the Luigi jazz technique. He trained in and performed ballet and modern dance with the Netherlands Dance Theater, the Scapino Ballet, the Rotterdam Dance Center, the Australian Dance Theater and the Bat-Dor Dance Company of Israel.
        Mr. Terborgh joined the Graham company in 1976, and in 1982 became a rehearsal director and teacher with the company. He also performed with choreographers, including Paul Sanasardo, Pearl Lang and Mary Anthony.
        He taught master classes in modern dance at companies and schools throughout  Europe and the United States and staged Graham's "Diversion of Angels" for the Dutch National Ballet and the Juilliard School. At the time of his death, he was a faculty member at Purchase and also a rehearsal director for the Purchase Dance Corps.
        He is survived by his mother, Petronella Zwetsloot Barbee; his father, Cornelius Zwetsloot; two brothers, and five sisters, all of the Netherlands. A memorial service will be held on July 5 at 3 P.M. at the Juilliard School, 66th  Street west of Broadway.
