        Robert Michael Thornton, a Manhattan art director known for his designs of books and magazines on home decorating, died on Monday at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 64 and lived in Greenwich Village.
        The cause was lung cancer, said Everett Short, his companion.
        Mr. Thornton was born in Scranton, Pa., and graduated from Syracuse University, where he majored in art. He began his graphic-design career at Fawcett Publications in 1956. He briefly worked for Travel magazine and The New York Herald Tribune before becoming art director for the sports, travel and decorating magazines of Maco Publications in 1960.
        He filled the same post at 1001 Home Ideas, a home-furnishing magazine of Family Media, from 1974 until it stopped publication three years ago. Since then, he had freelanced out of his studio at home.
        In addition to Mr. Short, he is survived by his sister, Kay Violanti of Scranton.
