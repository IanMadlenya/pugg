        Bernard Smith, a salesman for an international import company and co-owner of a clothing shop, died on Thursday.
        He was 53 years old and lived in Manhattan and Lakeville, Conn.
        A friend, Linda Lipman, said Mr. Smith had died of a pulmonary embolism.

He is survived by his companion, Jeffery Helms; his father, Alfred, and a brother, Jeffrey, both of Los Angeles.
