        Francisco Ahumada, whose 18-month illness prompted many expressions of charity in his Long Island community, died Jan. 6 at Nassau County Medical Center, where he had been treated for cancer. He was 12.
        Francisco's fellow students at Manorhaven Elementary School, his parents' neighbors and many other people in Port Washington, L.I., and the Village of Sands Point had staged events to help his family.
        Francisco is survived by his parents, Marco and Linda Pena of Manorhaven, and a brother, Mauricio Ahumada, of Chile.
