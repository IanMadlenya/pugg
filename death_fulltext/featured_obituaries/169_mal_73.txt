        F. T. Liu, a Chinese-born United Nations official who worked closely with the American Nobel laureate Ralph J. Bunche during the Congo crisis of the 1960's and in many other trouble spots, died on Feb. 16 in his home in Bronxville, N.Y. He was 82.
        Born in Shanghai, the son of a distinguished Chinese painter, Mr. Liu was educated in Paris, where he graduated from the Institute of Political Science, after his father was expelled from China, reportedly for painting a nude.
        After working for two years with the Chinese Embassy in Paris, Mr. Liu joined the United Nations in 1949 and went to work for Dr. Bunche in the Trusteeship Division, charged with helping colonial territories gain their independence.
        In 1960 he moved to the Office of Special Political Affairs, where he again worked for Dr. Bunche and later Sir Brian Urquhart. In that post and then as an assistant secretary general, Mr. Liu played an important role in planning and organizing United Nations peacekeeping operations around the world.
        He was senior political adviser to the United Nations' huge peacekeeping operation in Congo from 1963 to 1964, then worked with the peacekeeping force in Cyprus and with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization in the Middle East.
        In 1970 he became secretary to the United Nations Good Offices Mission to Bahrain, helping that country's transition to independence.
        He retired from the United Nations in 1982 and became an associate professor at the University of Nice in France. But later that year he returned to the United Nations as a consultant on peacekeeping. In 1983 he was reappointed an assistant secretary general and remained in that post until his second retirement, in 1987, preparing a study of United Nations peacekeeping, published as ''The Blue Helmets.''
        Mr. Liu is survived by his wife, Joan, a son and daughter, Michael and Margaret, and four grandchildren.
