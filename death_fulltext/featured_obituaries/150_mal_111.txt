        John Dudley Dawson, an Antioch College administrator who became known to generations of students as Mr. Antioch for his role in revitalizing the college's approach to co-operative work-study education, died on Thursday at Greene Memorial Hospital in Xenia, Ohio. He was 97 and lived in Yellow Springs, Ohio.
        Mr. Dawson gained an international reputation through his work from 1936 to 1953 as director of co-operative education at Antioch, in Yellow Springs. The idea of integrating work experience with traditional academic study had been a hallmark of Antioch since 1920, but Dean Dawson greatly expanded the program.
        He found jobs for students in businesses across the country, promoted the concept of employers as ''field faculty'' and fostered the integration of co-op work with traditional classroom study.
        From 1953 to 1967, he was vice president and dean of students.
        For the next 16 years, he visited more than 100 colleges and universities around the world as a consultant on co-op education.
        Born in Haskins, Ohio, Mr. Dawson graduated from Denison University in 1923, earned a master's degree from Ohio State University, then did more graduate work at Ohio State, the University of Michigan and Columbia University
        His wife, Nona Dawson, died in 1995. He is survived by three sons, Evan, of New York City; John, of Lee, N.H.; and Darrell, of Santa Fe, N.M.; and six grandchildren.
