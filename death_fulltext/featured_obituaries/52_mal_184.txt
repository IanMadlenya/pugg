        Aaron C. Waters, a prominent geologist, died Saturday at a nursing home in Tacoma, Wash. He was 86 years old and lived in Tacoma.
        Professor Waters died of complications from a blood infection, a spokesman for the family said.
        He was the founder of the program in earth sciences at the University of California at Santa Cruz, whose faculty he joined in 1967. Earlier he taught at Stanford and Johns Hopkins universities and at the University of California at Santa Barbara.
        In the mid-1960's he was chosen by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to conduct geological training for a group of astronauts who later took part in lunar landings.
        He retired from teaching in the early 1970's and became a consultant to the United States Geological Survey and to the Los Alamos Laboratory.
        Professor Waters was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1982 he received the Penrose Medal of the Geological Society of America, its highest form of recognition for an earth scientist.
        He was a graduate of the University of Washington, where he received a master's degree in 1926, and in 1930 received a doctorate from Yale University.
        Professor Waters is survived by his wife, the former Elizabeth von Hoene ; two daughters, Susan Hansmann of Tacoma and Sharon Catron of Tracy, Calif.; and three grandchildren.
