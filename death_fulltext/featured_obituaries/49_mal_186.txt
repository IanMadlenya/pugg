        Jerry Mason, who published the photographic book "The Family of Man" and who was known as an editor and publisher of innovative picture and text books, died on Wednesday in Vineyard Haven, Mass. He was 77 years old.
        He died of lung cancer, his wife, Rees, said.
        In 1953, Mr. Mason published "The Family of Man," based on an exhibition assembled at the Museum of Modern Art by Edward Steichen. In 1955, Mr. Mason and Fred Sammis founded Ridge Press, which produced books that were then distributed by other American and international publishing firms.
        Mr. Mason and the Ridge staff created a series of books combining photographic and other images with texts by experts. These included "Family," with text by Margaret Mead and photographs by Ken Heyman, and "House of Bondage," by the South African photographer Ernest Cole.
        Mr. Mason was born in Baltimore and graduated from Johns Hopkins University and the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.
        From 1942 to 1947 he was associate editor of This Week, a nationally syndicated Sunday magazine supplement. From 1948 to 1952 he was the editorial director of Popular Publications and the editor of Argosy magazine.
        Surviving are his wife; a daughter, Judy, of San Francisco; a son, Michael, of Tarrytown, N.Y., and four grandchildren.
