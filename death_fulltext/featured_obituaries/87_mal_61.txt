        John J. Powers Jr., retired head of Pfizer Inc. in New York, died yesterday at the Good Samaritan Medical Center in West Palm Beach, Fla. Mr. Powers, who lived in North Palm Beach, was 81.
        The cause was cancer, the company said.
        Mr. Powers, whose father was a vice president of Pfizer, a member of its executive committee and a director, joined the pharmaceutical company at its New York headquarters in 1941 as head of its newly formed legal department.
        During a period of rapid corporate expansion, he became a senior vice president in 1953 and the company's vice chairman in 1963. He served as president and chief executive officer from 1965 until he retired in 1972.
        He was a 1934 graduate of Georgetown University and in 1937 received a law degree from Yale University.
        Mr. Powers is survived by his wife, Jane, of North Palm Beach; a daughter, Louise, of Washington, and a sister, Betty Smith of Old Greenwich, Conn.
