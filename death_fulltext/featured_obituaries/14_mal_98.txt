Mr. Vorenberg, who lived in Cambridge, was president of Gilchrist's, one of Boston's oldest department stores. His father, Felix Vorenberg, headed the store for many years.
        The younger Mr. Vorenberg went to work at Gilchrist's in 1921, became president in 1943 and served until 1973. Gilchrist's, which was founded in 1841, closed in the mid-1970's.
        Mr. Vorenberg, who was born in Boston, was graduated from Harvard in 1920. At Gilchrist's he was a leader in hiring blacks and other members of minority groups well before fair employment legislation was enacted in Massachusets.
        Mr. Vorenberg's wife, the former Ida Muhlfelder, died last month. Surviving are two sons, Dr. John Vorenberg of Lexington, Mass., and James Vorenberg of Cambridge, dean of the Harvard Law School; six grandchildren and a great-grandchild.
