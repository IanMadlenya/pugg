        Edward M. Greenberg, the stage director of hit musical classics from New York to Los Angeles in the 1960's, died on Tuesday at Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 71 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was a stroke after open-heart surgery, his family said.
        Mr. Greenberg retired in 1991 as a professor in the drama and theater department of Queens College. He had taught there in the 1950's and rejoined the faculty in 1971.
        Richard Rodgers, as president and producing director of the Music Theater of  Lincoln Center, engaged Mr. Greenberg for revivals of "The King and I," "The Merry Widow," "Kismet" and "Carousel" in the summers of 1964 and 1965. Mr. Greenberg also staged hot-weather diversions like the nautical spectacular "Hit  the Deck" at the Jones Beach Marine Theater in 1960.
        He was the associate producer and stage director for the Los Angeles and San  Francisco Civic Light Opera Association, whose Musical Theater Workshop he helped found in 1962. Starting in the 1950's, he also had an 18-year association as a director and executive producer with the St. Louis Municipal Opera, during  which he directed "Roberta" with Bob Hope.
        Born in Brooklyn, he graduated from City College and received a master's in theater arts at the University of Wisconsin a year later. He held a variety of administrative posts with arts groups and headed the Colden Center for the Performing Arts at Queens College from 1977 to 1981. One of his drama students was Jerry Seinfeld.
        Mr. Greenberg is survived by his wife of 38 years, Sara Dillon Greenberg; a daughter, Elizabeth Greenberg, and a son, David, both of Manhattan; and a brother, Jules, of Newport Beach, Calif.
