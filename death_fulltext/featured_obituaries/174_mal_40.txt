        Michael Murtagh, chairman of the physics department at Brookhaven National Laboratory and an expert on high-energy physics, died on Thursday at John T. Mather Hospital in Port Jefferson, N.Y. He was 57 and lived in Shoreham, N.Y.
        The cause of death was a heart attack, said his wife, Marie Murtagh.
        Dr. Murtagh joined the staff at Brookhaven in 1970 as a junior research assistant.
        As he moved up in the organization, Dr. Murtagh began working extensively on experiments with the subatomic particles known as neutrinos.
        In 1997, after conducting several successful neutrino experiments, including one that involved a collaboration with Los Alamos National Laboratory and the University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Murtagh was chosen to head the physics department.
        Dr. Murtagh was born in Northern Ireland on July 27, 1943. He received a bachelor's degree from National University in Ireland.
        He came to the United States in 1967 and received his doctorate in high energy physics from Harvard.
        In addition to his wife, Dr. Murtagh is survived by a son, Stephen, of Shoreham; and two daughters: Catherine Pierce of Flushing, N.Y., and Eileen Murtagh of Cleveland.
