        Franz Bader, a prominent retired art dealer and bookseller, died on Wednesday at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, where he lived. He was 90.
        The cause was a pulmonary embolism, said his wife, Virginia.
        Mr. Bader was born and educated in Vienna, where he worked for Wallishauser, the city's oldest bookstore. He left Austria in 1939 for Washington, where he was hired by the Whyte bookshop and gallery and eventually became a partner. In 1952 he opened a gallery-bookstore of his own near George Washington University, moving as business grew.
        His establishments were gathering places for artists and writers. In the 1950's, he was the first dealer in Washington to exhibit the works of such painters as Gene Davis and Kenneth Noland. Later, he showed the folk art of Grandma Moses and the etchings of Gunter Grass. In the 1970's, he presented exhibitions of Eskimo art. And when Dylan Thomas, Rachel Carson, Edith Sitwell, Aldous Huxley and Robert Graves were in town, he gave parties for them. He retired in 1986.
        His first wife, Antonia, died in 1967. He and Virginia Forman married in 1971, and they traveled widely to the Amazon, Africa and Asia. His photographs from these trips and his abstract studies were exhibited at the Corcoran Gallery, the Phillips Gallery and elsewhere.
