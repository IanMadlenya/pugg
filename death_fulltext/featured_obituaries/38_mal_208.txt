        Sheldon Shkolnik, a concert pianist who played with many American orchestras, died of AIDS on Saturday at his home in Chicago. He was 52 years old.
        Mr. Shkolnik, who was known for playing Romantic works and pieces by American composers, performed frequently with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra as well as with the St. Louis, San Francisco and Detroit symphonies. He also gave recitals throughout the country and participated in many concerts in Grant Park in Chicago.
        Mr. Shkolnik studied with the composer Darius Milhaud and attended the Juilliard School. He made his Chicago Symphony debut in 1957 at the age of 19 and his New York debut in 1966 at Philharmonic Hall (now Avery Fisher Hall) in Lincoln Center.
        His final public appearances were with the Chicago Symphony on March 15 to 17 for the premiere of John Corigliano's Symphony No. 1, a work the composer dedicated to several friends who had died or were dying of AIDS. Although the pianist was not named in the score, Mr. Corigliano acknowledged that he had written the first movement, ''Apologue: Of Rage and Remembrance,'' as a tribute to Mr. Shkolnik.
        Surviving are a sister, Marcia Meer, and a brother, Arnold Shkolnik, both of Chicago.
