        Simon M. Jaglom, a New York businessman and financier, died on Wednesday at New York University Medical Center. A Manhattan resident, he turned 96 last Saturday.
        A native of Ukraine, he moved to what was then the Free State of Danzig, where he became general director of the Ministry of Foreign Trade. He went to London in 1937 to establish a business and came to this country two years later.
        He became president and later chairman of the New York Commodities Corporation and the Overseas Barters Corporation and continued to head both concerns until last month.
        He was a longtime supporter of Israel and Jewish causes. He was a past president of the American-European divisions of the United Jewish Appeal and of the Organization for Rehabilitation Through Training. He and his wife donated a wing to the Tel Aviv Museum.
        He is survived by two sons, Henry, of Los Angeles, and Michael, of Manhattan; two brothers, Josef, of Geneva, and David, of London and Tel Aviv, and two granddaughters.
