        Ruth Moss, a founder and executive director of the White Plains Symphony Orchestra, died at New York Hospital on Monday after a long illness. She was 60 years old and lived in Scarsdale, N.Y.
        Mrs. Moss, who was born in 1927, graduated from Barnard College in 1947 with a degree in history. After college, she worked for Time Inc. as business manager for the newsreel series ''March of Time.''
        She moved to Scarsdale in 1961 and helped found the Music for Westchester Orchestra, the county's first professional orchestra, which later became the White Plains Symphony Orchestra. She had been the chairman of the orchestra's board and last year became the executive director, a post she held until the orchestra was dissolved last month because of financial problems.
        Mrs. Moss had been on the Scarsdale Planning Board and in 1981 was its chairman.
        She is survived by her husband, Dr. Leonard Moss of Scarsdale; two sons, John, of Wayland, Mass., and William, of Scarsdale; a daughter, Vanessa, of Chicago, and her mother, Ethyl Hoffert of Manhattan.
