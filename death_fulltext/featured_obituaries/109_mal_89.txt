        Nazaret Cherkezian, a retired television producer and telecommunications specialist, died on Monday at his home in McLean, Va. He was 71.
        The cause of death was a brain tumor.
        Mr. Cherkezian had worked for the Smithsonian Institution until 1987, directing its Office of Telecommunications for 13 years. He had previously worked for National Educational Television, chiefly as an executive producer of  "News in Perspective," a weekly one-hour program produced in the 1960's in association with The New York Times.
        Born in New York City, he graduated from New York University and began his career in communications at The New York Herald Tribune in 1946. He also worked  for New York University, where he established its Office of Radio-Television; for CBS-TV, as producer of the "Eye on New York" series, and for the National Public Affairs Center for Television in Washington, as director of programming.
        At the Smithsonian, Mr. Cherkezian helped to develop a unit to produce films, television programs and radio series. He left to work full time at his own communications company.
        Mr. Cherkezian is survived by his wife, Margaret; a son, Michael; a daughter, Deborah; his mother, Helen; a sister, RoseMarie, and two granddaughters.
