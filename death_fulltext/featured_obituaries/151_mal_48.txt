        William R. Stott, who rose from selling petroleum products in Pennsylvania to the highest executive levels of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey before beginning a second career as a venture capitalist and consultant, died on Wednesday. He was 91.
        Mr. Stott, who did business with such well-known figures as the shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, had been ailing for a year, his son Michael A. Stott said.
        In the heyday of America's postwar industrial might, the oil industry, along with automobiles and steel, formed the base of economic and political power, and Mr. Stott learned the intricacies of the business as a rising sales executive with Standard Oil. He coordinated marketing for the company, negotiated for control of foreign refineries and traveled frequently to Europe and Latin America.
        Mr. Stott was named a vice president of Standard Oil of New Jersey in 1960 and an executive vice president in 1961.
        In 1968, three years after his fellow executive, Michael L. Haider, had been promoted to chairman, Mr. Stott left to form Harbill Associates, a venture capital partnership, in association with Harry W. Knight.
        In the early 1970's, he served as a consultant to the Pittston Company, which was then engaged in an ultimately unsuccessful effort to win Federal approval of a new oil refinery in Eastport, Me. He was also a director of Pittston, the Bank of New York, the Urban National Bank and the Foreign Policy Association of the United States.
        Mr. Stott's wife, Irene Kearns Stott, died in 1987. In addition to his son Michael, Mr. Stott is survived by another son, William R. Stott Jr.; two daughters, Betsy Kimmerle and Susan Stott; 17 grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.
