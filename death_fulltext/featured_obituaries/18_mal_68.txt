        Prof. Roy M. Nakayama, a horticulturist devoted to breeding chilis, died of lung cancer Monday at Memorial General Hospital in Las Cruces, N.M. He was 64 years old and lived in Las Cruces, his native city.
        Professor Nakayama taught and did research in agriculture and horticulture at New Mexico State University for 32 years before retiring in 1984. He had a bachelor's degree from New Mexico State and master's and doctoral degrees from Iowa State University.
        Chili, in both plant and gastronomic forms, was his passion. He devoted his life to breeding the plants, hybridizing to obtain ever more subtle varieties. Plants he developed account for 80 percent of the commercially grown chili in New Mexico, according to his wife, Rose.
        For more than 20 years, Professor Nakayama was a judge at the International Chili Society World Championship Cookoff. He loved eating chili, his wife said, and during his hospital stay demanded red chili salsa to spread over his food.
        At the time of his death, he was working on a chili plant that would produce multiple pods.
        Surviving are his wife; four brothers, Carl and Joe, both of Las Cruces, Willie, of Miami, and John, of Albuquerque, N.M.; a sister, Ann Davis of Many, La., and his mother, Tome, of Las Cruces.
