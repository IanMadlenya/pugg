        Nicholas G. Pappas, a writer and former economic development official for New York City, died on Wednesday at New York University Medical Center. He was 66 and lived in Brooklyn Heights.
        The cause was complications after heart surgery, said Bill Neugebauer, a family friend.
        Mr. Pappas was born in Brooklyn and grew up in the shadow of Ebbets Field. At his death, he was working on a book of reminiscences and reflections of prominent people recalling the Brooklyn Dodgers and their move to Los Angeles. Mr. Neugebauer said that Mr. Pappas had interviewed nearly 400 people for the book but had been able to finish only two chapters.
        Mr. Pappas attended Columbia College for two years before he joined the Army in 1951. Assigned to the Signal Corps, he became a sergeant-instructor in telegraphy.
        His 20 years of city service stemmed from his work for Robert F. Wagner's first mayoral campaign in 1953. Fluent in Greek, Mr. Pappas got out the Greek-American vote, and Mr. Wagner made him a deputy commissioner in the Department of Economic Development.
        In that post, he worked as a liaison between minorities and city agencies dealing with their business and economic concerns. He was also a speechwriter for Mayor Wagner and his successor, Abraham D. Beame.
        Mr. Pappas became one of the city's more visible middle-level managers. He directed safe-street programs and projects that improved street lighting, turned stretches of the city's thoroughfares into pedestrian malls at dusk and dotted neighborhoods with vest-pocket parks.
        He resigned in 1974 to write full time. He maintained close ties with the city's Greek-American community and frequently contributed to Greek-American newspapers and magazines.
        Mr. Pappas is survived by a brother, James G., of Dix Hills, L.I.
