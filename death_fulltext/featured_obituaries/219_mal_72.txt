        Earl Wilson, a leading pitcher for the Boston Red Sox and the 1968 World Series champion Detroit Tigers, and one of the top home run hitters among major league pitchers, died Saturday at his home in Southfield, Mich. He was 70.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Jim Martin, the executive director of the Baseball Assistance Team, which provides financial aid to former baseball figures. Wilson served as the organization's president from 2000 through 2004 and headed its grants committee at his death.
        Pitching for 11 years in the major leagues, Wilson had a record of 121-109. His best season was 1967, when he was 22-11 for the Tigers, tying Boston's Jim Lonborg for the American League lead in victories. That Tigers team finished one game behind the pennant-winning Red Sox.
        In 1968, when the Tigers won the World Series, defeating the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games, Wilson was a 13-game winner on a staff featuring the 31-game winner Denny McLain and the left-hander Mickey Lolich, who won three Series games.
        Wilson, a native of Ponchatoula, La., made his major league debut with the Red Sox in 1959, as their first black pitcher. Infielder Pumpsie Green was the first black player on the Red Sox, joining them earlier that season, when Boston was the last of the 16 major league franchises of the era to break the color barrier.
        Wilson pitched a no-hitter against the Los Angeles Angels on June 26, 1962, a 2-0 victory in which he hit a home run.
        A converted catcher, Wilson hit 33 homers while in a game as a pitcher and 2 as a pinch-hitter, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Only Wes Ferrell (37 home runs), Bob Lemon and Warren Spahn (35 each) and Red Ruffing (34) hit more homers as pitchers, according to Elias. Wilson hit seven home runs in a season twice and hit a pair of homers against the White Sox in an August 1965 game. His 35 career homers came in only 740 at-bats. In the mid-1960's, Wilson became the first sports figure to be represented by Bob Woolf, a Boston lawyer who was a pioneering agent for athletes and represented entertainers through Bob Woolf Associates.
        Wilson was traded from the Red Sox to the Tigers in June 1966 after posting four seasons of double-digit victories. A 6-foot-3, 215-pound right-hander who relied on sliders and fastballs, he went on to an 18-11 record that season. ''He'd overthrow his slider and it would back up and have a rotation like a spitball,'' the former Tigers catcher Bill Freehan told The Detroit Free Press.
        Wilson was sent to the San Diego Padres in 1970, and he finished his career with them that year.
        He later founded an automotive parts company.
        He is survived by his wife, Roslin, and his sons, Greg, Marvin and Mark.
