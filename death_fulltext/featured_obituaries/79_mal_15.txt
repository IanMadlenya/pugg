        Robert C. Cosgrove, a past chairman of the Green Giant Company, maker of frozen and canned vegetables, died on Sunday at his home in Naples, Fla. He was 74.
        He had long been ill, his family said.
        Mr. Cosgrove was born in Le Sueur, Minn., a grandson of the company founder, Carson N. Cosgrove, who originally called it the Minnesota Valley Canning Company. He attended the University of Virginia and the University of Minnesota before being commissioned into the Army in 1942 for four years' wartime service. Reaching the rank of captain as a company commander, he saw action in Europe and returned with three Battle Stars, a Silver Star and a Bronze Star, among other honors.
        His career with the food packager, identified nationally with its Green Giant line of products, began in 1946. He rose to hold a number of top positions, including board chairman, president and chief executive; after he took on the chairmanship in 1974, he occupied all three offices for a time.
        He was the third generation of his family to lead Green Giant. His grandfather -- generally known as C.N. -- his father, Ward, and he presided over the company's growth throughout its independent existence.
        He became a director of the Pillsbury Company in 1979 when it acquired Green Giant and remained on the Pillsbury board until his retirement in 1983. Since then Pillsbury itself and its Green Giant division have taken over by Grand Metropolitan Plc. of Britain.
        Mr. Cosgrove is survived by his wife, Eleanor Dodd Cosgrove; three sons, Robert C. Jr., of Minnetonka, Minn., Dodd B., of Long Lake, Minn., and William H., of Tacoma, Wash.; a daughter, Lindsay C. Gorman of Winnetka, Ill.; a brother, Edward B., of Rancho Mirage, Calif.; a sister, Ann Warner of Wayzata, Minn., and eight grandchildren.
