        Dr. Seale broadcast his weekly sermons on ''Healthymindedness'' from about 1940 to 1973, when he retired. He also wrote several books on religious themes, including ''Ten Words That Will Change Your Life'' and ''Success Is You.''
        The Church of Truth, a metaphysical religion, had offices and held services at Carnegie Hall and later at Philharmonic Hall, now Avery Fisher Hall. The church is no longer in existence.  Dr. Seale is survived by his wife, Elva; a daughter, Kathryn Weir; three grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.
