        Dr. Frank Pickering Brooks, a noted gastroenterologist and former chief of the University of Pennsylvania's gastrointestinal section, died Monday at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. He was 71 years old and lived in Wynnewood, Pa.
        Dr. Brooks died of bone cancer, his wife, Emily, said.
        He was president of the American Gastroenterological Association in 1980 and won several awards, including the Julius Friedenwald Medal for his work with the association.
        Dr. Brooks was graduated from Dartmouth College in 1941. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in 1943 and received a Ph.D. in science from the university in 1944. He later served in the Navy.
        In 1962 he became chief of the gastrointestinal section at Pennsylvania. He retired in 1990 and became a professor emeritus in medicine and physiology.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Emily Marden; a daughter, Sally Elizabeth Braff, and a son, Robert P., both of Toronto, and eight grandchildren.
