        Rinaldo Ossola, an Italian banker and a leading international monetary theoretician, died Friday at a hospital in Rome. He was 77 years old and lived in Rome.
        It was reported that he died of cancer.
        Mr. Ossola played a major role in postwar monetary reform and cooperation. He was a leading proponent of the system of Special Drawing Rights set up by international monetary agencies to increase monetary liquidity by getting around the somewhat restrictive gold-standard system.
        Born in Lecco, Italy, and educated at the Bocconi University in Milan and at the London School of Economics, Mr. Ossola was the former director of the central bank of Italy.
        He was with the bank for almost 40 years, first in the research department and later as its foreign representative in London, Lisbon and Paris. He served as deputy director from 1965 to 1975, and as director from 1975 to 1976, when he left to become Italy's Minister of Foreign Trade. He held this position until 1979 and helped reform Italy's foreign trade regulations and encouraged exports.
        He also served for many years as chairman of the committee of deputies of the "Group of Ten," the key international monitary organization made up of finance ministers of the 10 most industrialized nations.
        In recent years, he was in private banking with Banca di Napoli and Credito Varesino.
        He is survived by his wife, Gilberte.
