        Robert Cronbach, a sculptor and medal artist, died Wednesday in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, where he had lived for several years. He was 93.
        Over his nearly seven-decade career, Mr. Cronbach worked in styles both representational and abstract and specialized in public commissions.
        He was born in St. Louis in 1908 and studied sculpture at the St. Louis School of Fine Arts and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. In 1930 he worked as an assistant to the sculptor Paul Manship.
        His commissions included sculptures and fountains at the United Nations General Assembly Building and the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York and the Federal Office Building in St. Louis.
        Mr. Cronbach had his first solo show at the Hudson Walker Gallery in New York in 1940 and exhibited for many years with the Bertha Shaefer Gallery. He taught at Adelphi College in Garden City, N.Y., from 1947 to 1961 and was also an instructor at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine, serving as chairman of the school's board of governors from 1975 to 1982.
        He is survived by the children of his first wife, Maxine Silver Cronbach, who died in 1983: his daughter, Paula Maria Espinosa, and his sons Michael and Lee. He is also survived by four grandchildren and his wife, Anne Heathers Cronbach.
