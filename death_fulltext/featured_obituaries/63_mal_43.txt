        Rabbi Bernhard N. Cohn, who served 25 years as the rabbi of Congregation Habonim in Manhattan, died on Tuesday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. He was 68 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of heart disease, his family said.
        The son of a rabbi, he was born in Bonn, Germany, and came to the United States in 1940. He graduated from the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in New York and was ordained in 1953.
        For the next four years he was the rabbi of Temple Emanuel in Utica, N.Y., and then for five years was the rabbi of the Suburban Temple in Wantagh, L.I. In 1962 he became the associate rabbi at Congregation Habonim and in 1965 was elevated to senior rabbi. The congregation, composed mostly of German immigrants, was founded in 1939 by his father-in-law, Dr. Hugo Hahn.
        Rabbi Cohn, who was given the title rabbi emeritus when he retired in 1990, was a past president of the New York Association of Reform Rabbis.
        He is survived by his wife of 41 years, Miriam, and a son, Daniel, and a daughter, Ruth Warner, both of Manhattan.
