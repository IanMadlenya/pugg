        Alfredo Campoli, an Italian-born violinist who gave his first London performance at age 13 and went on to become a noted concert violinist, died on Wednesday. He was 84 years old.
        His wife, Joy, said today that her husband had been on his way to a bridge game in Buckinghamshire northeast of London when he collapsed and died.
        When he was 13, Mr. Campoli won the London Music Festival's gold medal for his performance of Mendelsohn's violin concerto. After that he gave regular public recitals as a child.
        He made hundreds of recordings during a career that spanned 55 years.
        Mr. Campoli was born in Rome and raised in London. His father, a musician, started giving him violin lessons at age 6.
