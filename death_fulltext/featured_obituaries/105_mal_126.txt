        Morris Bruckman, an engineer who led a group that designed the landing gear for the first spacecraft on the moon, died on Tuesday. He was 81 and lived in Franklin Square, L.I.
        The cause of death was complications from surgery, said Richard Rogers, a friend of the family.
        Mr. Bruckman was working at the Grumman Aerospace Corporation in the 1960's with a group that designed the landing gear for the Lunar Excursion Module, which enabled two Apollo 11 astronauts, Neil Armstrong and and Col. Edwin W. Aldrin of the Air Force, to make the first lunar landing on July 20, 1969.
        Since the moon's gravity is only a fraction of Earth's, the designers were forced to discard established engineering formulas and to calculate the stiffness needed to support the lander as it reached the moon's surface. The signatures of the engineers on the project were recorded on microfilm and left on the moon, along with the lunar lander, after Mr. Armstrong and Colonel Aldrin blasted off to rejoin the command module and return to Earth.
        In the mid-1970's, Mr. Bruckman changed careers, becoming a regional engineer for the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, responsible for landfills and the integrity of water supplies in Nassau and Suffolk Counties.
        Mr. Bruckman is survived by his wife, the former Asta Lillian Guth; a daughter, Hazel Fershleiser of Brooklyn Heights; a son, Neal R. Bruckman of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
