        Rebecca Grand, a former teacher and assistant principal in New York City public schools, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 84 years old.
        Miss Grand fell last winter and grew progressively weaker afterward, said her lawyer, Hazel Schizer.
        During a 35-year career from 1937 to 1972, Miss Grand was a history teacher, guidance department chairman and an assistant principal of Samuel J. Tilden High School in Brooklyn. Before that, she taught history and economics at Hunter College High School from 1929 to 1937. She retired in 1972.
        Miss Grand, a native of Brooklyn, received a bachelor's degree at Hunter College in 1929 and a master's degree at Teachers College, Columbia University, in 1931.
        There are no immediate survivors.
