        Felix W. Salmaggi, an opera impresario and theater manager, died of cancer on Monday at the Hospice of Northern Virginia in Arlington, Va. He was 77 years old and lived in Falls Church, Va.
        As general manager of the Brooklyn Opera Company for more than 20 years, Mr. Salmaggi carried on the tradition of his father, Alfredo Salmaggi, who produced grand opera available at a popular price.
        When he retired in 1983, Felix Salmaggi was an administrator with the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey circus.
        With his younger brother Guido, Felix Salmaggi established the Long Island Opera Company in 1955. In 1956, they were invited to the Brooklyn Academy of Music, and the Brooklyn Opera Company was born.
        In the 1960's Mr. Salmaggi occasionally expressed his frustration that there were too few outlets for talented opera singers in New York, that he could never get critics to go to Brooklyn and that foundations had not recognized small companies like his.
        From 1957 to 1967, he worked with the Feld Brothers at the Carter Barron Amphitheater in Washington to produce a week of grand opera every summer from 1957 to 1967.
        During World War II, Mr. Salmaggi was captain of an infantry company and fought in the Battle of the Bulge and the Remagen Bridge campaign.
        He is survived by his wife, Joanna J., of Falls Church; a daughter, Robin Joan of Mesa, Ariz.; two sisters, Lina di Gregori of Brooklyn and Dora Truzzolino of New Hyde Park, L.I.; four brothers, Guido G., of Honolulu, Henry F., of New Hyde Park, Mario B., of Southampton, L.I., and Robert I., of Quogue, L.I.
