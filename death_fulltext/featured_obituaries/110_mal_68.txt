        William Douglas, a modern dancer and choreographer, died on March 10 at a hospital in Montreal. He was 42 and lived in Montreal.
        The cause was AIDS, said a colleague, Marie-Elizabeth Roy.
        Mr. Douglas was born in Nova Scotia. He studied architecture before turning  to dance in 1978. He performed with companies in Canada and the United States, and then formed his own troupe in New York in 1986.
        In 1991, he moved to Montreal, where he taught at the University of Quebec at Montreal. He also directed William Douglas Dance, which, in addition to regular  seasons in Montreal, performed across Canada and Europe.
        Mr. Douglas received the grand prize for professional choreographers in 1994  at the Bagnolet Dance Festival in France. He and the dancer Jose Navas received  a joint Bessie Award in 1995 for "While Waiting," a solo for Mr. Navas.
        He is survived by his companion, Mr. Navas; his mother, Edith Anne Purdy of Amherst, Nova Scotia, and two sisters, Helen Douglas and Carrie Bova, both of Carleton Place, Ontario.
