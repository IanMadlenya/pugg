        A former president of the Westchester County Bar Association, stricken with cancer and a heart condition, shot and killed himself Monday while on the telephone with his doctor, the authorities said.
        The victim, Benjamin Taylor, 76 years old, was pronounced dead at 5:30 P.M. at his house in the Brook Hills development here. A report released today by the Medical Examiner's office declared the death a suicide. The lawyer's doctor, whose name was withheld by the police, reported the shooting at 3:20.
        Mr. Taylor was Harrison Town Attorney from 1955 to 1957 and president of the Westchester Bar Association from 1977 to 1979. He was vice president of the New York Bar Association from 1983 to 1985.
        In 1972, he founded the law firm of Taylor & McCullough, now Taylor, McCullough, Goldberger & Geoghegan, with offices here and in Harrison. A partner, Charles Goldberger, said Mr. Taylor had suffered from prostate cancer, which had spread to his spine. He had also been treated for a heart condition. Mr. Goldberger said Mr. Taylor was seen at a hospital Sunday and released Monday.
        In the mid-1960's, Mr. Taylor was counsel to Pepsico Inc., when it established its headquarters in Harrison, and he represented Stouffer Hotels, part of Nestle Holdings Inc., when it wanted to build in town.
        He is survived by his wife, Lucille; a son, Richard, of Colorado Springs; a sister, Estelle Brockelman of Portsmouth, N.H., and two grandchildren.
