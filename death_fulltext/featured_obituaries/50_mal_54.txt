        Dr. Dale Hale Clement, a New Haven pediatrician and educator, died on Friday at Yale New Haven Hospital. He was 81 years and lived in New Haven.
        He died of a brain hemorrhage, his daughter, Constance, said.
        Dr. Clement began his career in 1946, when he set up a practice in New Haven and became clinical professor of pediatrics at the Yale School of Medicine.
        Later, as director of the pediatric hematology laboratory and associate chief of pediatrics at Yale New Haven Hospital, he made contributions to the understanding of blood diseases in children. Among them was the treatment of purpura, a disease characterized by subcutaneous hemorrhaging, and the prevention and treatment of iron deficiencies that lead to anemia. He retired in 1985.
        In World War II, Dr. Clement was a major in the Army Medical Corps.
        Dr. Clement, a native of Buffalo, graduated from Yale University in 1931 and from the Harvard Medical School in 1935.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Constance Chambers; a daughter, Constance, of New Haven, and two brothers, Stephen M., of Tryon, N.C., and Norman, of Pasadena, Calif.

        An obituary on Thursday about a New Haven pediatrician and educator rendered his name incorrectly. He was Dr. David Hale Clement.
