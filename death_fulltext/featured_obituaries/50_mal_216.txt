        Dominic G. Bellissimo, whose late-night craving for a snack inspired Buffalo chicken wings, died on Saturday at his home. He was 68 years old.
        Although his mother perfected the recipe for the hot sauce that adds zing to scrawny chicken parts, Mr. Bellissimo promoted the Buffalo dish into a world-famous entree.
        "My father not only presided over the beginning of chicken wings, but he really nurtured the whole idea," his daughter, Terry Lerner of East Amherst, told The Buffalo News.
        Chicken wings, with blue cheese and celery on the side, were first offered in Bellissimo's Anchor Bar at Main and North Streets. The homespun cuisine is now sold in hundreds of restaurants around western New York and throughout the nation.
        Mr. Bellissimo's wife, Edith, is expected to continue running the Anchor Bar and offering the hot, saucy wings.
