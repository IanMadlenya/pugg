        Matthew D. Edel, professor of urban studies at Queens College and an author, died on Wednesday at Beth Israel Medical Center. He was 49 years old and lived in Sunnyside, Queens.
        He died of septic shock after being treated for cancer, the college said.
        Dr. Edel, a specialist in urban economics and Latin American development, joined the Queens faculty in 1972 and was chairman of the urban studies department from 1983 to 1987. Since 1984 he served on the economics faculty at the City University of New York Graduate School and was a senior associate of the Bildner Center for Western Hemisphere Studies in Manhattan.
        He wrote several books on urban affairs, including "Food Supply and Inflation in Latin America," published in 1969; "Economies and the Environment" (1973) and "Shaky Palaces: Homeownership and Social Mobility in Boston's Suburbanization" (1984).
        Dr. Edel, a native of Brooklyn, was a graduate of Harvard and held a master's degree from Columbia and a doctorate from Yale. He taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for five years before joining the Queens faculty.
        His uncle, Leon Edel, is the biographer of Henry James and other literary figures. Dr. Edel is survived by his wife, the former Kim Dye; his father, Abraham, of Philadelphia; three sons, Keir, Stephen and Gareth, all of Queens, and a sister, Deborah, of Manhattan.
