        Neal Travis, a gossip columnist for The New York Post whose work appeared daily opposite the paper's Page Six celebrity page, died yesterday at New York University Medical Center. He was 62 and lived in Manhattan and Bridgehampton, N.Y.
        The cause was cancer, a spokesman for The Post said.
        Mr. Travis, who was born in 1940 in New Zealand, started working on newspapers there and in Australia at 16. He came to New York in 1966 to work as a correspondent for The Sydney Daily Mirror. He joined The Post in 1977 as the first editor of Page Six. He left the paper to become the editor of New York magazine's Intelligencer column and then returned to The Post in 1993 to begin his own column, Neal Travis' New York. His last column appeared on July 29.
        He is survived by his wife, Joan, known as Tolly; a brother, Murray, of Sydney, Australia; two stepdaughters, Sarah Furlong and Anna Furlong, both of Sydney; a stepson, James Furlong of Canberra, Australia; and two stepgrandchildren.
