        George B. Allen, the retired head of the association representing nonprofit hospitals and nursing homes in New York State, died on Thursday at his home in Clifton Park, N.Y. He was 60.
        His death followed a long respiratory illness, said a spokeswoman for the Hospital Association of New York State, where he had worked.
        Mr. Allen joined the association's staff in 1962, was promoted to chief executive officer in 1971 and was appointed as its first full-time president in 1974. He retired in 1986.
        The association, which has headquarters in Albany, represents more than 300 hospitals, nursing homes and other health care institutions on legislative and regulatory issues and in providing economic research.
        Mr. Allen served as the industry's spokesman to government agencies, and in that role, he helped create the state's "uncompensated care" program. It takes a portion of hospital and insurance company revenues to reimburse hospitals for the care of nonpaying patients, most of whom are poor people without health insurance or Medicaid. The program now totals $700 million a year.
        Mr. Allen was born in Bridgeport, Conn. He graduated from the University of Massachusetts in 1955. He served in the Army in counterintelligence and was a first lieutenant in the reserves.
        Before joining the hospital association, he worked for Shell Oil Company as an accounting supervisor in Albany and in its Manhattan headquarters.
        Surviving are his wife, Danuta; a son, Matthew, of Waterford, N.Y.; a daughter, Gail Allen Waker of Boston; a brother, Maurice of Spotsylvania, Va., and two grandsons.
