        Ralph E. Pearson, a retired Army colonel who during the closing days of World War II helped to recover a cache of European art treasures stolen by the Nazis, on Monday at Brackenridge Hospital here died of injuries from a car accident. He was 86 years old.
        Mr. Pearson's wife, Clarice, an artist at the University of Texas, also died at the hospital yesterday. She was 82 years old. They were injured on Dec. 18 when their car spun out of control.
        In the last week of the war, Mr. Pearson led a group into a village in the Austrian Alps to reclaim masterpieces the Nazis had looted during their march through Europe. Included were works by Leonardo, Rembrandt, Michelangelo and Goya and the entire collection of the Monte Cassino Abbey in Italy. At the time, the artworks were estimated to be worth $500 million.
        The task force also recovered Hitler's personal library and took into custody Ernst Kaltenbrunner, a Gestapo chief who became a chief defendant in the Nuremberg trials.
        Mr. Pearson wrote about the mission in a five-volume history of World War II, "En Route to the Redoubt."
        Mr. Pearson, who received a master's degree in journalism from the University of Missouri in 1950, taught at St. Edward's University in Austin from 1965 to 1967.
        Surviving are two daughters and a son.
