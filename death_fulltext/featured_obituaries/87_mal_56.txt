        Fred Reinglas, a stage manager for Broadway and Off Broadway shows for the last 30 years, died on March 31 at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 58 and lived in Greenwich Village.
        The cause was lymphoma, said Joe Regan Jr., a friend.
        Mr. Reinglas worked on plays and musicals. His credits included the original and national productions of "Hair" as well as overseas productions of the show in France, Argentina, Germany and Israel.
        He was also the stage manager for Sam Shepard's "Fool for Love," Larry Kramer's "Destiny of Me," William Hoffman's "As Is," Albert Innaurato's "Gemini" and other productions. At his death, he was the senior stage manager at the Circle Repertory Company, most recently for Jon Robin Baitz's "Three Hotels" and Paula Vogel's "Desdemona."
