        Peter A. Bonanni, the publisher of Golf Magazine, died on Thursday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. He was 62 and lived in Armonk.
        His family said the cause of death was cancer.
        For Mr. Bonanni, who had been Golf's publisher since 1986, his eight-year tenure with the Times-Mirror subsidiary was a rare period of stability in a peripatetic career in advertising and publishing.
        A native of Philadelphia who earned a degree in marketing from the University of Connecticut and worked as an ad salesman for The Ladies Home Journal, Mr. Bonanni became president of its parent company, Charter Publishing, in 1978, after he had moved from The Journal to Woman's Day and then to The New York Times in 1976.
        He left Charter in 1980 to become publisher of CBS Publication's magazine group, which included Women's Day, moving on after two years, first for a three-month stint as publisher of Rolling Stone, then for five months as publisher of The Dial, Channel 13's monthly magazine. After that he became president of the media studies division of Simmons Market Research.
        He is survived by his wife, Lois; a brother, Jack, and two sons, Jesse and Matt.
