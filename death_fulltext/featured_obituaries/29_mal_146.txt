        Lee Calhoun, who won two Olympic gold medals in the 110-meter hurdles, died today. He was 56 years old.
        Mr. Calhoun, the head track and field coach at Western Illinois University since 1980, had been in poor health for the last four years and had suffered a stroke.
        Mr. Calhoun was the first man to win successive Olympic hurdle titles. His first came in the 110-meter hurdles at the 1956 Games at Melbourne, Australia, when he was virtually unknown. He slipped past his heavily favored teammate, Jack Davis, in a photo finish and his time of 13.5 seconds was an Olympic record.
        Four years later at Rome, he again narrowly beat a teammate, Willie May, winning by one-hundredth of a second for his second gold medal.
        Mr. Calhoun, who was born in Laurel, Miss., was a seven-time national champion and also held world records in the hurdles at 110, 70, 60 and 50 meters.
        In 1983, Mr. Calhoun was voted to the Olympic Dream Team along with Renaldo Nehemiah and Rod Milburn. He was a member of the National Track and Field Hall of Fame and the United States Track and Field Hall of Fame.
        Mr. Calhoun's coaching career began at Grambling in 1967, where he served for three years before accepting an assistant's job at Yale. He became Yale's head coach in 1976 and moved to Western Illinois four years later.
        He also served as a United States Olympic team coach in 1968 and as an assistant in 1976.
        Mr. Calhoun is survived by his wife, Gwendolyn; a daughter, Brenda Calhoun Cash, and a son, Daniel.
