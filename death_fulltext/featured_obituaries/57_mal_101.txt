        Howard J. Crosby Jr., a retired dean of students at Rutgers University, died Tuesday at St. Peter's Hospital in New Brunswick, N.J. He was 72 years old and lived in New Brunswick.
        He died of heart disease, his family said.
        Descended from Col. Henry Rutgers, for whom the school is named, Mr. Crosby graduated from Rutgers in 1941 and began working there that year. Except for a break from 1943 to 1946 to serve in the Army, his career was as a Rutgers administrator. He was the dean of men and later dean of students, serving in those posts for a total of 19 years before he retired in 1983.
        During his tenure, Rutgers grew from a private college for men to a coeducational state university. He helped oversee many changes, including the admission of women and the construction of residence halls, student centers and recreation buildings.
        He was president of the Eastern Association of College Deans and Advisers of Students in 1973-74 and was honored by Rutgers for his work. Off campus, he served as chairman of City Residents Against Substandard Housing and for 10 years was on the New Brunswick Citizens' Advisory Committee for Community Improvement.
        Mr. Crosby, who was born in Vineland, N.J., held a master's degree from Columbia University.
        He is survived by a sister, Eleanor Wilson of Highland Park, N.J.
