        Geraldine Mindell, who led the campaign to create the Jefferson Market Garden, an oasis of more than 200 varieties of flowers, shrubs and trees in the heart of Greenwich Village, died on Monday. She was 84.
        Mrs. Mindell, who lived in the Village for more than 50 years, died of lung cancer at Lenox Hill Hospital, according to a spokesman for her family.
        The triangle-shaped garden was once the site of the New York City Women's House of Detention, a 12-story building that cast a grim shadow over the Jefferson Market Library, a former courthouse, until the prison was torn down in 1973.
        Mrs. Mindell led the fight to get rid of the prison and the battle to replace it with a garden. The land is owned by the New York City Parks Department, but the garden is financed by Village residents and businesses and by grants from foundations.
        Mrs. Mindell was a founder of the Association of Village Home Owners and the West Ninth Street Block Association and was chairwoman for 24 years of the Village Committee for the Jefferson Market Garden.
        Mrs. Mindell, whose husband, Joseph, died last year, is survived by a sister, Sarah Weisman of Phoenix.
