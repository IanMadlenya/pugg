        Jed Mattes, a literary agent and gay-rights advocate, died on July 24 at his home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. He was 50.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, said Fred Morris, his executor and business associate.
        Mr. Mattes started his career with International Creative Management. In 1989 he formed Jed Mattes Inc., based in Manhattan. It handled fiction and nonfiction, as well as film and television rights.
        His clients included Bill Bryson, the author of a current best seller, ''A Short History of Nearly Everything'' (Broadway Books).
        He was also the United States representative of Michael Frayn, the British playwright and novelist.
        He was the founding president and immediate past president of the Paul Rapoport Foundation, established in 1987 as a support group for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people.
        He was also a former trustee of the Hetrick-Martin Institute for the Protection of Lesbian and Gay Youth, created in 1984.
        Born Joseph Edward Mattes in Dubuque, Iowa, he attended the University of Iowa before moving to New York in 1970.
        He is survived by his sisters Emily McAdoo of St. Johnsbury, Vt., and Kate Mattes of Cambridge, Mass.
