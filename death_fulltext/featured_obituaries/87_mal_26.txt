        Leopold P. Oberst, a New York Telephone Company executive who was on loan to City Hall as a management specialist and efficiency expert in the administrations of Mayors Abraham D. Beame and Edward I. Koch, died on Saturday at Martin Memorial Medical Center in Palm City, Fla. Mr. Oberst, who lived in Palm City, was 75.
        The cause of death was lung cancer, said his wife, Kathleen.
        Mr. Oberst served as the first director of operations in City Hall from February 1977 to November 1978. Mayor Beame ordered Mr. Oberst to examine the functioning of the city's 30 agencies and to recommend ways to improve their efficiency.
        Mr. Oberst came to the attention of civic leaders in 1973 when he oversaw the rebuilding of a 173,000-telephone switching center at Second Avenue and 13th Street that had been knocked out of service by the worst fire in Bell System history. He was widely praised for his administrative and management skills that led to the restoration of services in 24 days.
        From 1979 to 1983 he also was one of three business representatives appointed by Gov. Hugh L. Carey to the State Financial Control Board.
        Mr. Oberst rose through the ranks to become a major in the Army during World War II and, after the war, joined New York Telephone as a $28-a-week switchman in the Bronx. He served in operations and engineering assignments, rising through the corporate ranks to become a vice president of New York Telephone in 1978. He retired in 1983.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Oberst is survived by two sons, Robert, of Syracuse and Thomas, of Boston; three daughters, Alice Fortin of Plattsburgh, Laurie Courage of Port Washington, L.I., and Hillary Quigley of Yonkers, and a sister, Roberta Castellani of Tampa, Fla.
