        Jean Murray Branscombe, who helped develop one of New York City's first vest-pocket parks and was an aide to Laurence A. Rockefeller, died on Tuesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 64 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer, her family said.
        She was the executive director and later chairwoman of the Greenacre Foundation, founded by Abby Rockefeller Mauze. It developed Greenacre Park, an enclave with lush plants and a 25-foot-high waterfall on the north side of 51st Street between Second and Third Avenues in Manhattan.
        The foundation also helped preserve and enhance other open spaces in Fort Tryon, Battery Park, Bryant Park and Union Square.
        She also worked as an assistant to Eliot Richardson, later Attorney General in the Nixon Administration, when he was a lawyer in Boston, and was an assistant to Nelson A. Rockefeller in New York City and Washington.
        She is survived by her husband, Robert F. Branscombe, a retired textile manufacturing executive; two sons: Peter, of Fairfield, Conn., and John, of Manhattan, and a sister, Betty Omohundro of Ponte Vedra, Fla.
