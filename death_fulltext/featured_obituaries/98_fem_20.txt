        Maude B. Feld, a retired Manhattan antiques dealer and expert on early American glassware, died on March 13 at her home in Manhattan. She was 94.
        She suffered a lengthy illness, her family said.
        She advised collectors, dealers and museums, and researched the history of the reproduction of antique glassware in Italy. She also helped to assemble collections of Wedgwood pottery and American art glass that later were donated to the Brooklyn Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
        Born in Passaic, N.J., she opened a shop in New Jersey in the mid-1930's and moved it to Madison Avenue in 1959. She retired about 15 years ago.
        Mrs. Feld is survived by her husband of 70 years, Samuel B.; two sons, Dr. Alan, of Las Vegas, and Stuart P., of Manhattan, two grandchildren and a great-grandson.
