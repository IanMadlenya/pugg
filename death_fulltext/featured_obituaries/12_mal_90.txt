        The Hungarian-born artist studied painting in Paris and architectural engineering in Berlin before coming to the United States in 1926 and beginning a successful career as a fashion and fabric designer.
        In 1948, while working as a fashion director for Simplicity Patterns, he had a one-man exhibition in New York of his oil paintings, wire montages, dry-pen drawings and abstract photography. He also devised a method for using standard typewriter characters to create patterns for weaving or printing.
        In 1968, he received a $5,000 award from the National Endowment for the Arts for his accomplishments in the visual arts. But for the last 30 years of his life, he refused without giving any reason to exhibit or sell any of his work, according to his son, Robert E. Karoly, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
        The artist is survived, in addition to his son, by two grand-daughters, Ms. Michele Clevering of Los Angeles and Mrs. Suzanne Martinez of Phoenix.
