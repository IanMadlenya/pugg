        Bruce C. Hackett, a former managing director of Salomon Brothers, died on March 10 at his home in New York. He was 61.
        The cause was amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known as Lou Gehrig's disease, said his wife, Joann.
        Mr. Hackett worked for Salomon Brothers for 30 years starting in 1968. In 1992, he became co-head, with Rodney B. Berens, of global equities, which was responsible for sales, research, trading and capital markets on a worldwide basis. According to Mr. Berens, Mr. Hackett was involved in developing new markets and in streamlining the company's internal trade operations. ''He increased the capacity of the firm to process very large volumes efficiently,'' Mr. Berens said.
        Mr. Hackett started at Salomon as a trader. He concentrated on derivatives and developed program trading, a method of packaging trades, for the company.
        He was named managing director in 1991 and served on Salomon's executive committee, which met to review company policy, until 1995, when he became a member of the management board.
        Mr. Hackett left Salomon in 1998 and joined Wasserstein Perella, an investment bank, as managing director.
        Mr. Hackett attended Brown University and graduated from Babson College in Babson Park, Mass., with a business degree in 1962. Before joining Salomon, he worked for Citibank and the Bank of New York.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by their son, Henry, and their daughter, Daisy; a daughter from a previous marriage, Anne Hackett, of Pecos, N.M.; and a brother, Leeds, of New York.
