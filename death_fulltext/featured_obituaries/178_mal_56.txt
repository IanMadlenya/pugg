        John A. Babarovic, an architect who worked on major airport projects as well as residential architecture, died on Nov. 2 in London, where he lived. He was 69.
        The cause was complications after heart surgery, his family said.
        Mr. Babarovic was director of long-range planning at American Airlines in the late 1960's. He represented the airline in the design and engineering of the Super Bay Hangars in Los Angeles and San Francisco. These were the largest in the world at the time, designed to accommodate four of the new Boeing 747's and two DC-10's under one roof. He also designed the American Airlines terminal at San Francisco.
        While with the firm of Harrison & Abramowitz in New York, he worked on the Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center and the Citibank headquarters. At the time of his death he was working on a double-decker docking system for the Airbus A380, a superjumbo jet that is planned to have two seating levels.
        Mr. Babarovic was born in Susak, Yugoslavia, and was a graduate of St. George's College in Argentina and Syracuse University. He served in the United States Army, in military intelligence, in the Korean War.
        He is survived by his wife, Anne Crawford Babarovic of London; a sister, Frances Baglantzis of New Rochelle, N.Y.; two daughters from a previous marriage, Juliana Babarovic Jaynes of Newport News, Va., and Christina Maria Babarovic of London; and a grandson.
