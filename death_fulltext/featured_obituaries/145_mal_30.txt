        Rod Sorge, a former executive of the Harm Reduction Coalition, a private organization that promotes services for drug users and other people on the fringes of society, was found dead in his upper Manhattan apartment on Jan. 28. He was 30.
        He died of AIDS-related causes, the coalition said in announcing his death.
        Mr. Sorge was the coalition's development director, in charge of fund-raising until October 1997, when he stopped working because of his illness. He joined the staff in 1995 after having worked for other organizations with goals similar to those of the Harm Reduction Coalition.
        Edith Springer, senior trainer at the Harm Reduction Coalition's Training Institute in Manhattan, said that Mr. Sorge was a writer who  ''wrote grant proposals that brought tears to your eyes.'' The coalition gets most of its support from foundations, she said.
        Mr. Sorge was born in Texas and grew up in Chicago. He attended Vassar College.
        A decade ago he moved to New York and became a founder of an underground needle exchange program operated in the Bronx and Harlem by Act Up, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power. The program's goal was to reduce the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, among addicts who injected drugs intravenously.
        Before joining the Harm Reduction Coalition, Mr. Sorge worked for Health-PAC, a Manhattan-based health policy group, and for the American Civil Liberties Union. He and a colleague there, Ruth Harlow, jointly edited a book, ''A.C.L.U. Briefing Book on Needle Exchange, Harm Reduction and H.I.V. Prevention in the Second Decade'' (1994).
        He then became the first administrative director of the New York Peer AIDS Education Coalition.
        In 1996, he received the Drug Policy Foundation's Robert C. Randall Award for Achievement in the Field of Citizen Action.
