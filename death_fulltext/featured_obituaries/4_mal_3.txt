        Antonio Borja Won Pat, former delegate to Congress from Guam, died of a heart attack Friday at Holy Cross Hospital, hospital officials said. He was 78 years old.
        Mr. Won Pat, who was admitted at the hospital here Thursday, was a leader in the movement that eventually gained United States citizenship for his Pacific island's residents in 1950.
        He served as Speaker of the Territorial Assembly and held that post when the assembly became the Legislature.
        Mr. Won Pat, a Democrat, was Guam's delegate to Congress from 1972 until 1984, when he was defeated by Ben Blaz, a Republican.
        Although he was no longer in office, he came to Washington to monitor Senate hearings on appropriations for territories, said Roger Stillwell, a family spokesman in Agana, Guam.
        Mr. Won Pat leaves his wife, Ana, and eight children.
