Previously he had been the director of Ambulatory Electrocardiographic Monitoring at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital and earlier the director of Clinical Electrophysiology at Children's Hospital in Philadelphia.
        Dr. Horowitz was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and had also taught at the Bowman Gray School of Medicine, University of Illinois Medical Center and Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh.
        He served on the editorial boards of several professional journals and had been an official in the American Heart Association.
        Born in Brooklyn, he grew up in North Miami, Fla. After graduating from Tulane University, he earned his medical degree at the University of Pennsylvania.
        Surviving are his wife of 23 years, the former Dona Weinstein; his mother, Belle S. Horowitz of Pembroke Pines, Fla.; two sons, Adam and Joshua; a daughter, Aimee, and a sister, Marcia Josowitz of Hollywood, Fla.
