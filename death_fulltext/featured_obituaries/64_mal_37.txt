He was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and a fellow of Sigma Xi, and belonged to the American Physical Society and the American Association of Physics Teachers, among other organizations.
        Dr. Thatcher's wife, the former Tennie Marie Klotz, died in 1988. He is survived by a son, James, of Yorktown Heights, N.Y., a daughter, Lucy Franck, of San Diego, six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.
