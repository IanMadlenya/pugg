        Harry Wald, a former president of Caesars Palace, a casino-resort on the Las  Vegas strip, who also served several years as president of the Nevada Resort Association, died on Tuesday at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington. He was 71.
        The cause of death was cardio-respiratory failure, a hospital spokesman said.
        Mr. Wald, who served in the Army during World War II and was named brigadier general of the Nevada Army National Guard by Governor Mike O'Callaghan in 1973,  later attained the rank of major general.
        Born in Germany, Mr. Wald fled to the United States to escape Nazi persecution at the age of 14.
        He came to Las Vegas in the 1960's after meeting Jay Sarno, the developer of  Caesars, in San Francisco. He began as project manager and eventually took over  as president of the resort, turning it into one of the most successful in the industry.
        Mr. Wald brought a string of sports events to the resort, including major tennis tournaments, automobile races and championship boxing matches.
        Born Hans Eichenwald on May 19, 1924, in Rhein, Westfalen, Germany, Mr. Wald  and his sister, Hannah, fled their homeland in 1938 with the help of the United Jewish Charities. Their brother, Fritz, and their parents, Hugo and Fanny, died in the Auschwitz death camp in Poland.
        Mr. Wald grew up in Detroit, then joined the Army, serving in the counterintelligence division in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany during World War II.
        After leaving Caesars Palace in 1984, he took over as president of MGM Grand  Hotels International, the owner of the former MGM Grand, which became Bally's.
        He is survived by his wife, Maryellen McPeak, a son, Kerry Lee Eichenwald, a  daughter, Allyson Wald Butto, and a grandson, Christian Butto, all of Las Vegas, and his sister, Hannah Marcus of San Francisco.
