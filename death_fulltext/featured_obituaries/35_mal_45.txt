        Lord Elwyn-Jones, a prosecutor at the Nuremberg war-crimes trials and Britain's chief legal officer under the last Labor Party Government, died of cancer on Monday at the age of 80.
        Lord Elwyn-Jones was active in politics until his death and attended the opening of Parliament last month. He was scheduled to be in the House of Lords on Monday to give Labor's views on whether the Government should permit the prosecution of suspected Nazi war criminals in Britain.
        ''The memories of Nuremberg are still vivid in my memory,'' he said in July. ''The millions deliberately put to death - that cannot be passed over as a mere aberration which should be forgotten in the mere tide of history.''
        He was born Frederick Elwyn-Jones in Wales in 1909, the son of a steelworker. He attended the University of Wales and then Cambridge, where he was president of the Union, the debating society. He became a lawyer in 1935.
        He is survived by his wife, three children and nine grandchildren.
