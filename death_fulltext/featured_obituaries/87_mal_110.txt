        Lieut. Col. Charles W. Shea, who won the Medal of Honor and a battlefield commission in Italy in 1944, died on April 7 at Central General Hospital in Plainview, L.I. He was 72 and a resident of Plainview.
        The cause of death was a heart attack, his family said.
        Colonel Shea devoted himself to veterans' affairs after the war and joined the National Guard as a first lieutenant in 1949. In 1966 he came to command the First Battalion, 69th Infantry of the New York National Guard, and he retired from the Guard in 1972.
        Colonel Shea, lanky and red-haired in his youth, grew up in the Bronx. He sold cold drinks and peanuts at Yankee Stadium while he was in high school and later got a mechanic's job in a refrigeration plant. Silencing Machine Guns
        As a sergeant during the Italian campaign in World War II, he led a squad of Company F, 350th Infantry of the 88th Division in its progress toward Rome in May 1944. German machine-gun positions held up his company's advance from Mount Damiano, near Cassino, causing 30 casualties.
        Fire at first pinned him down, but he crept forward and used his rifle and hand grenades to silence three machine guns. He got six Germans to surrender and killed all three gunners in the third machine-gun position.
        That feat earned Sergeant Shea the Medal of Honor for exceptional valor and a commission. The medal was awarded to him personally by Gen. Mark Clark, then commander of the 15th Army Group. He also received a hero's welcome in New York City, and the Italian Cross of Valor and the Polish Silver Cross.
        After the war, he held positions at the New York City Veterans Service Center on Park Avenue and the city's Division of Veterans Affairs.
        He is survived by a son, Charles Jr.; a daughter, Elizabeth Agiesta; two brothers, James, of Hicksville, L.I., and Robert, of the Bronx; a sister, Kay Hind of Port Richey, Fla., and one granddaughter.
