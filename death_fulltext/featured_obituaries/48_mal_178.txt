        Herbert A. (Herbie) Lewis, the captain of Detroit Red Wings hockey teams that won the Stanley Cup in 1936 and 1937 and a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame, died of heart failure on Sunday in Indianapolis. He was 85 years old.
        Mr. Lewis, who was born in Calgary, Alberta, on April 17, 1905, played with Detroit in the National Hockey League from 1928 through 1939. A left wing more noted for his defensive talents than his scoring, he was known as the fastest skater in the league during the 1930's. He was also believed to be the league's highest-paid player in 1935 when he received a salary of $8,000. He played in the league's first All-Star Game in 1934.
        Mr. Lewis is survived by his wife, Ceverene, and two sons, George Herbert Lewis of Del Ray, Fla., and Gerald Lewis of Indianapolis.
