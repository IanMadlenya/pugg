        The Rev. Colman J. Barry, a priest who was the former president of St. John's University in Collegeville, Minn., and the historian of the first century of the university, died on Friday at the St. Raphael's Retirement Center at St. John's. He was 72.
        The cause was cancer, the university said.
        During Father Barry's tenure as president, from 1964 to 1971, many new institutions were established at the university, among them the Center for Ecumenical and Cultural Research, which is a residential center for religious and social study, and the Hill Monastic Manuscript Library, a microfilm collection of monastic manuscripts from around the world.
        Father Barry was born in Lake City, Minn. He graduated from St. John's with a degree in history in 1942 and was ordained in 1947. He received a doctorate from Catholic University of America in 1953 and began teaching history and theology at St. John's that year.
        After serving as St. John's president, he became dean of religious studies at Catholic University, in Washington, where he served from 1973 to 1978. He was a visiting professor of church history at Yale University in 1973. From 1978 to 1983, he was director of the Institute for Spirituality at St. John's. In recent years, he was president of the Hill Monastic Manuscript Library.
        He was chairman of the National Committee on Education for Ecumenism in 1965. In 1967, he was president of the Minnesota Association of Colleges.
        He wrote a history of St. John's, "Worship and Work" (Liturgical Press, 1956), an updated version of which was published days before his death. He also wrote "Catholic Minnesota," "Readings in Church History" and "American Nuncio: Cardinal Aloysius Muench."
        He is survived by a sister, Mary Potts of Brookfield, Wis., and a brother, Richard, of Lake City.
