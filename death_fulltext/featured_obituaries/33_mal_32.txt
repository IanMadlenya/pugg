        Michael Eugene Choukas, an expert on the uses of propaganda who taught sociology at Dartmouth College for 30 years, died Monday at the Hanover Terrace Health Care Facility in New Hampshire. He was 87 years old and lived in Portsmouth, N.H.
        In the 1930's Professor Choukas instituted a course in propaganda, one of the first in the nation, in the sociology department at Dartmouth. From 1943 to 1945, during World War II, he was with the Office of Strategic Services in Washington.
        Professor Choukas was born in Samos, Greece, and came to this country as a teen-ager. He graduated from Dartmouth in 1927 and received a master's degree and a doctorate at Columbia. He joined the Dartmouth faculty in 1929 and became a full professor in 1940. He retired in 1967.
        He then became director of liberal studies and later provost at Pierce College in Athens, Greece, where he remained until 1975.
        He was the author of two books, ''Black Angels of Athos'' (Stephen Daye Press, 1934), and ''Propaganda Comes of Age'' (Public Affairs Press, 1965).
        Professor Choukas is survived by his wife, the former Gertrude Spitz; a son, Michael E. Choukas Jr. of Hanover; three grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.
