        Edward P. Bullard 4th, the former president of TechnoServe, a non-profit international development organization, died on Thursday in his home in Wilton,  Conn. He was 61.
        The cause was prostate cancer, said his wife, Carol.
        After graduating from Yale College in 1957, Mr. Bullard worked for his family's machine tool manufacturing company in Bridgeport and as a hospital administrator in Ghana. In 1968 he became the founder and president of TechnoServe, which is now based in Norwalk, Conn. He stepped down as president in 1995.
        TechnoServe operates at the community level, conveying business know-how to the rural poor of developing countries. It has 220 employees, chiefly in Africa  and Latin America.
        Mr. Bullard's 1957 marriage to Gail Elizabeth Grew ended in divorce in 1973.
        He is survived by his wife of 22 years, the former Carol Mary Harrison; a son, Payson Harrison Bullard of Wilton; three daughters, Jennifer Broggini of Lugano, Switzerland; Amy Davies of Auckland, New Zealand, and Erika DiGiovanni of West Redding, Conn.; four granddaughters; a sister, Mary Jane McGlennon of Gloucester, Mass.; and a brother, Daniel Alling Bullard of Branford, Conn.
