        Robert Waldron Herzberg, the surrogate in Columbia County, N.Y., from 1963 to 1971 who ruled in an important adoption case, died on Thursday at Monterey Peninsula Hospital in Carmel, Calif. He was 84 years old and lived in Carmel.
        The family said he died of a heart attack.
        In 1967, Judge Herzberg gave custody of a 4 1/2-year-old to Mr. and Mrs. Michael T. Leuni of Tillson, N.Y., who had been her foster parents since she was 5 days old. The Ulster County Welfare Commissioner, Joseph Fitzsimmons, opposed the move. He said the blond blue-eyed child would not be suitably raised in the home of a middle-age couple of Italian-American descent.
        Judge Herzberg, who took the case when it was moved, had investigators review the case and ruled that the Leunis, who had three children of their own aged 12 to 18, could give the girl, Beth, a proper upbringing.
        Judge Herzberg, who used the name Waldron, was born in Hudson, N.Y. He was an alumnus of Yale and the Albany Law School. He practiced law in Hudson until he was appointed surrogate. He moved to Carmel in 1980.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Ruth Miller, and a sister, Helen, of Manhattan.
