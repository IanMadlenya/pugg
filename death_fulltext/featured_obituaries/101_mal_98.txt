        Harry Tisch, who headed the Communist labor unions in East Germany and was a member of its ruling Politburo, died yesterday in Berlin. He was 68.
        Friends said the cause was cancer, according to The Associated Press.
        Mr. Tisch ran the unions, which had 10 million members, for 14 years, and turned them into a highly refined machine for carrying out policies of the East German Communist Party. He was ousted from his post in November 1989.
        Last January seven former Politburo members were charged with 47 counts of manslaughter in connection with the killings of people who had been trying to flee from East Germany to West Germany in past years. Although the officials' names were not made public, he was reported to have been one of them. The cases have not come to trial.
        The East German authorities ordered border guards to open fire on people seeking to flee to West German territory.
        The two German states were formally united in October 1990, and Mr. Tisch became the first Politburo member to be tried in the unified Germany. He was charged with the misappropriation of money, goods and services totaling $71 million, mainly involving the misuse of union vacation homes. He denied any wrongdoing and accused Germany of subjecting him to a political trial.
        His trial, which was also the first of a former East German Communist leader, ended after four months in June 1991. He was found guilty of five counts of misappropriation of funds and was sentenced to 18 months in jail. But he was freed because he had spent 14 months in pretrial detention.
        In its unanimous verdict, the court of three judges and two jurors dropped the main charge against Mr. Tisch, the diversion of $57 million in union pension funds in 1984 to pay for an elaborate festival organized by the Communist youth group.
        No information was immediately available about survivors.
