        John Prebble, a writer and historian who specialized in the bloody battles that marked Scotland's past, died on Jan. 30 in London. He was 85.
        In books like ''Culloden'' (1961), ''The Highland Clearances'' (1963), ''Glencoe'' (1966) and ''The Darien Disaster'' (1968), Mr. Prebble wrote what some academic critics deemed to be highly novelistic, partisan accounts that romanticized those conflicts at the expense of historical accuracy. The books sold millions of copies, nevertheless.
        Born in London, Mr. Prebble became a Canadian for a few years when his family immigrated to Saskatchewan, returning to London with the onset of the Depression.
        He served in the Royal Artillery during World War II and after the war became a columnist for The Sunday Express.
        Mr. Prebble also wrote several novels, including ''The Edge of the Night'' (1948), about a German woman and a British soldier at the end of World War II, and two stories set in the American West, ''The Buffalo Soldiers'' and ''Spanish Stirrup.''
        He was also a co-author, with Cy Endfield, of the screenplay for the 1964 movie ''Zulu,'' with Stanley Baker and Michael Caine. His television credits included contributions to ''Elizabeth R'' and ''The Six Wives of Henry VIII.''
        His autobiography, ''Landscapes and Memories,'' appeared in 1993.
        He is survived by his second wife, Jan Reid, and two sons and a daughter from his first marriage.
