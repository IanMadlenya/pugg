        Robert B. O'Connor, an architect whose projects included the Harvey S. Firestone Memorial Library at Princeton University and alterations and additions to the Metropolitan Museum of Art carried out in the late 1940's, died on Monday at his home in Mount Kisco, N.Y. He was 97.
        Mr. O'Connor was born in Manhasset, L.I. After earning a bachelor's degree from Trinity College in Hartford in 1916, he served as a captain of field artillery in World War I. He received a master of fine arts degree from Princeton in 1920.
        He began practicing as an architect in New York City in 1921. In 1930, he and his father-in-law, Benjamin Wistar Morris, formed Morris & O'Connor, with which Mr. O'Connor practiced until 1942. From 1943 to 1959, Mr. O'Connor was a partner in O'Connor & Kilham. During this period, the firm designed the two-story wing of the Metropolitan Museum that now contains medieval art and European sculpture and decorative arts.
        Mr. O'Connor's principal architectural works in New York include the Continental Bank & Trust Company, the Union League Club and the General Theological Seminary. His many projects at colleges and universities also included the Colgate University Library and Lehman Hall and Wollman Library at Barnard College.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary Wistar O'Connor; two sons, Robert Jr., of Denver, and Anthony M., of Manhattan, and four grandsons.
