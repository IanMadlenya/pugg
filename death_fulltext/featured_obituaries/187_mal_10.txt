        Bernard Haldane, who founded a pioneering career counseling firm and wrote 14 books about changing jobs and looking for work, died on July 21 in Seattle. He was 91 and had lived in Seattle since 1977.
        His books include ''Career Satisfaction and Success: How to Know and Manage Your Strengths'' (JISD, 1995).
        Mr. Haldane worked with individuals and institutions, including the Atomic Energy Commission, Exxon, the Harvard Graduate School of Business administration, the Peace Corps and the United Presbyterian Church.
        The career consulting firm he founded in New York City in 1947, Bernard Haldane Associates, was sold in the early 1970's. It still exists under that name and has almost 100 offices around the United States and in other countries.
        He was born in London, graduated from high school there and moved to New York City in the late 1920's.
        After various jobs, he became a labor relations consultant and a member of the Society for the Advancement of Management, which asked him to help officers returning after World War II to find jobs.
        He did that on an unpaid basis and began working full time in career counseling soon after the war.
        An early marriage ended in divorce.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Jean Margaret Kind, whom he married in 1967.
