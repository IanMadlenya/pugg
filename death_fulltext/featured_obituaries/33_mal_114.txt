        John Gombojab Hangin, a university professor in the United States and an expert on Mongolian language and culture, died of heart disease Oct. 9 in Ulan Bator, the capital of Mongolia, where he was doing research. He was 68 years old and lived in Bloomington, Ind.
        Dr. Hangin, who was born in Chakhar, Inner Mongolia, in 1921, studied at Hokkaido Imperial University and later earned a Ph.D. from Indiana University. He was a representative in the National Assembly of the Republic of China in 1947 and came to the United States after the Communist Government took power in 1949.
        He was one of a handful of Mongols living in the United States and for years served as the main channel for the exchange of information between American officials and scholars and their counterparts in Mongolia. His efforts helped to lay the groundwork for recognition of the Mongolian People's Republic by the United Nations in 1961 and American recognition in 1987.
        He was the founder of the Mongolia Society and was a professor of Uralic and Altaic languages at Indiana University. He had joined the faculty there in 1964, after teaching at Columbia and Georgetown universities, and the University of California at Berkeley.
        Dr. Hangin complied several English-Mongolian dictionaries and wrote several Mongolian language textbooks and a Mongolian reader.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Sarangerel Taichud; two sons, Eric, of Portland, Ore., and Franklin, of Anchorage, Alaska; a daughter, Gloria; his mother, Galindari, of San Jose, Calif., and two grandchildren.
