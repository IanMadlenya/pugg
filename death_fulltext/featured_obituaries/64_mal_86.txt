        Alvin M. Greenbaum, an award-winning interior designer and co-founder of Greenbaum Interiors of Paterson and Morristown, N.J., died on Tuesday at his home in Wyckoff, N.J. He was 66 years old.
        Mr. Greenbaum died of cancer, said his brother and business partner, Joseph.
        Opening a small furniture store in Paterson in the late 1940's, the two brothers built their business into one that created original designs and duplicated period furniture for clients in the United States and Europe.
        In 1985 the magazine House Beautiful named Alvin Greenbaum, a 1947 graduate of the New York School of Interior Design, one of the 10 best interior designers in the United States. In 1988 he was honored for his creativity by the American Society of Interior Designers.
        In addition to his brother, Mr. Greenbaum is survived by his wife, Arlene; a son, Richard, of Manhattan; two daughters, Lori Greenbaum Mann of Manhattan and Jane, of Wyckoff; two sisters, Selma Bleiweiss, of Paterson, and Marion Margolis, of Upper Montclair, N.J., and two grandchildren.
