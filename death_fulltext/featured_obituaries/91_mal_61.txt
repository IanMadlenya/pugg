        Timor Djordjadze, a Russian-born stage director in New York, died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 49.
        The cause was cancer, said an announcement from Pace University, where Mr. Djordjadze was an associate professor of fine arts.
        Mr. Djordjadze graduated from the
        State Theater Institute in Tbilisi, Georgia, and the State Institute of Theater Arts in Moscow, and taught at both schools. After coming to this country in 1980, he lectured at Brandeis University and joined the Pace faculty in 1986.
        During the 1980's Mr. Djordjadze either directed or staged productions in Boston and Chicago as well as New York, where from 1983 to 1984 he was co-artistic director of the Open World Theater Company.
        He is survived by his wife, Edythe of Manhattan, and a sister, Ketevan Djordjadze of Tbilisi, Georgia.
