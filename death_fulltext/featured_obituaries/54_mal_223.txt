        Walter L. Hetfield 3d, a retired Union County judge who is believed to have been the youngest person to become a judge in New Jersey, died on Friday at his home in Scotch Plains, N.J. He was 85 years old.
        He died of arteriosclerotic heart disease, a spokesman for the family said.
        At age 34, Mr. Hetfield was appointed judge on the Union County Court of Common Pleas. He held that position until 1953, when he was promoted to the Matrimonial Division of the State Superior Court.
        In 1956, Judge Hetfield was a member of the State Supreme Court committee that wrote a program for substantially reducing what it called the "appalling" divorce rate in New Jersey. After a yearlong survey conducted for the court, the committee recommended establishing a state agency for marital counseling.
        Judge Hetfield was appointed assignment judge of Union County in 1957 and occupied that post until his retirement in 1972.
        Born in Plainfield, N.J., he graduated from Mercersburg Preparatory School and Dartmouth College. He received a law degree from Mercer Beasley Law School in Newark in 1932.
        His wife, the former Estelle Burke, died in May. He is survived by a son, Joseph B., of Watchung, N.J.; a daughter, Lynda H. Bianco of Bloomfield Hills, Mich; a brother, George F., of Plainfield; eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
