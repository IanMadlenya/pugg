        Ira Glackens, a writer who was the son of the realist painter William Glackens, died on Friday at his home in Shepherdstown, W.Va. He was 83 years old.
        He died of cancer, said Charles Brown, a funeral director in Martinsburg, W.Va.
        Mr. Glackens wrote several biographies and other books, and donated many paintings by his father to museums throughout the United States.
        He was born in New York City, studied painting with several of his father's contemporaries and began his career as a writer when he was discharged from the Coast Guard after World War II. In his 1957 book "William Glackens and the Ashcan Group," he chronicled the lives of his father, John Sloan, Everett Shinn, George Luks, Robert Henri and other Ashcan School artists.  Other Literary Works
        Mr. Glackens's other works included a 1964 biography of the opera star Lillian Nordica, "Yankee Diva and the Golden Age of Opera"; "Pope Joan: The English Girl Who Made It," about the legendary female pope; "Did Molly Pitcher Say That," a light-hearted history of the United States; "A Measure of Sliding Sand," a novel, and "Poor Mad Valerie and Other Poems."
        He also wrote hundreds of articles on music, theater and horticulture, and his enthusiasm for raising apples led him to contribute articles on rare apples for the Encyclopedia Britannica.
        Mr. Glackens donated paintings by his father and other turn-of-the-century American artists to the White House, the National Gallery and other museums. He also established the Eastern Slope Animal Welfare League in New Hampshire, where he lived for many years before moving to Washington, and then West Virginia in 1973.
        Mr. Glackens's wife of more than 50 years, Anne Middlebrook Glackens, died in June. He had no immediate survivors.
