        William Seamon, one of America's leading bridge players, died Saturday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Miami Beach, Fla. He was 74 years old and lived in Miami Beach.
        He was suffering from the effects of a stroke, said his sister, Edith Kemp Freilich.
        Mr. Seamon, known throughout his bridge career as Billy, represented the United States in the 1957 world team championship. He played in New York City as a member of a team headed by Charles Goren, and they were defeated in a head-to-head match by Italy.
        Mr. Seamon qualified to play in the world championship by winning the 1956 Spingold Knockout Team Championship. In 1963 he completed a very rare double by winning both the Spingold Teams and the Vanderbilt Knockout Teams. On both occasions Mrs. Freilich was a teammate.
        In 1973 he won the Grand National Teams, as a member of a Florida team. A year later he won his last major title, the Master Mixed Teams, with a foursome that included his wife, Rita, and Mrs. Freilich. The Seamon family has the best tournament record of any family in North America. Other family members who have won national titles are two of Mr. Seamon's children, Michael and Janice, and his sister, the late Anne Burnstein.
        Mr. Seamon was a retired banking executive and formerly conducted a syndicated bridge column. Also surviving him, in addition to his wife, sister and two children, is a third child, Richard Seamon.
