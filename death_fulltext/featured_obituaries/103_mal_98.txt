        William Strethen (Wild Bill) Davis, a leading jazz arranger, pianist and organist, died last Thursday in Moorestown, N.J. He was 77.
        The cause was a stroke, said his daughter, Kathryn Malvern.
        Mr. Davis was born in Glasgow, Mo., and was reared in Kansas. He studied music with his father, a singer, and then at Tuskeegee Institute and Wiley College. He moved to Chicago and worked with Milt Larkin as a guitarist and arranger from 1939 to 1942. He wrote arrangements for Earl Hines in 1943 and joined Louis Jordan as an arranger and pianist from 1945 to 1949. As the 1940's ended, he began playing the Hammond organ, leading an influential trio with a driving, bluesy attack.
        His arrangement of "April in Paris," originally written for his own small group, became a hit for Count Basie in 1955. In the early 1960's Mr. Davis recorded with Ella Fitzgerald and Johnny Hodges. From 1969 to 1971 he toured and recorded with Duke Ellington as an arranger, organist and second pianist.
        He worked with Lionel Hampton from 1978 to 1980 and returned to leading his own group in the 1980's, performing widely in the United States and abroad. In recent years his arrangements have been revived by the Illinois Jacquet Big Band.
        In addition to his daughter Kathryn, of Moorestown, he is survived by his wife, Barbara, also of Moorestown; another daughter, Wilma Lavern of New York City; three brothers, Robert, of Chicago; Henry, of Clinton, Md., and Chester, of Wilmington, Del.; three grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
