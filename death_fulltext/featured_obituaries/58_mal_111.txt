        Dr. Leonard D. Kurtz, a radiologist and former executive, died Sunday in his home on the East Side of Manhattan. He was 76 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, his family said.
        Dr. Kurtz, who was also an inventor, was born in the Bronx, studied at Albany Medical School, practiced in Detroit, moved back to the New York area and was president of Deknatel Inc., whose products included surgical sutures, and then of Bioresearch Inc., a research and development company.
        His wife, Esther, died in September. He is survived by two sons, Dr. Alfred B. Kurtz of Wynnewood, Pa., and Dr. Robert J. Kurtz of Manhattan; and five grandchildren.
