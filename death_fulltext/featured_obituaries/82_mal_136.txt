        Larry Uttal, a pop music business executive in New York for over 25 years, died on Thursday at his Manhattan apartment. He was 71.
        The cause of death was AIDS, said his daughter, Jody Uttal-Gold.
        Mr. Uttal owned and operated several record labels, including Madison Records and Private Stock Records, in the 50's, 60's and 70's. In the early 1960's he took over a children's label, Bell Records, and its affiliates, Amy and Mala, and for 15 years he released a large number of soul, rock and pop singles.
        During his career he worked with such recording artists as Tony Orlando and Dawn, Barry Manilow, the Fifth Dimension, Blondie, Frankie Valli, Lee Dorsey and the Box Tops.
        He folded Private Stock in 1978, moved to London and entered the film business. On his return to New York, he entered the travel business.
        Mr. Uttal was active in the Gay Men's Health Crisis and the National Gay and Lesbian Caucus.
        Besides his daughter, of Santa Monica, Calif., he is survived by a sister, Norma Levitt of Manhattan; his son, Jai Uttal of Berkeley, Calif., and two granddaughters.
