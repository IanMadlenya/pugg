        Dr. William Edward Cadbury Jr., former executive director of National Medical Fellowships Inc. in Manhattan, died on Tuesday at his home in Kendal-at-Longwood, a retirement community in Kennett Square, Pa. He was 82 years old and previously lived in New York and in Haverford, Pa.
        His family said he died of natural causes.
        A native of Philadelphia, Dr. Cadbury was a 1931 Haverford graduate with a Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of Pennsylvania. He joined the Haverford College faculty in 1935 as an instructor in chemistry, became a professor in 1954 and served as dean from 1951 to 1966.
        During his academic career, Dr. Cadbury became nationally known for his interest in furthering the prospects of minority-group students headed for graduate school. To that end, he and other faculty members in 1966 founded the Post-Baccalaureate Fellowship Program, which he directed for the next three years.
        He and his wife, Charlotte, devoted their time to that project and subsequently to National Medical Fellowships, both financed by private contributions. National Medical Fellowships was founded for that purpose in 1946 and has contributed millions of dollars in scholarships. Dr. Cadbury served as its executive director from 1969 through 1977 and his wife served as a director during those years.
        He is survived by a son, William, of Eugene, Ore.; a daughter, Sarah Giddings of Raleigh, N.C.; a sister, Eleanor Cadbury of East Thetford, Vt., and three grandchildren.
