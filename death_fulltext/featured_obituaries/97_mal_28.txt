        Ian Pitt-Watson, a professor at the Fuller Theological Seminary who had been a commentator and preacher on religious programs on British radio and television for nearly four decades, died on Jan. 11 at the St. John's Hospice in London. He was 71 and had lived in Pasadena, Calif.
        The cause was cancer, his son, David Pitt-Watson of London, said.
        From 1946 until his appointment to Fuller, he was a regular preacher on programs on the BBC and ITV and in 1962 presented the series "Why I Believe" to radio audiences in Scotland. He advised broadcasters on religious programming and preached in Canada, Australia and Africa as well as India and Korea.
        Born in Scotland, he served as pastor to Presbyterian congregations in Dundee and Glasgow before becoming the head of the department of practical theology at Aberdeen University in 1972. He left in 1980 to become professor of preaching and practical theology at Fuller. He retired last year.
        In addition to his son, he is survived by two daughters, Margaret Pitt-Watson of London and Rosemary Thorner of Yetminster in Dorset, England; two grandchildren; and four step-grandchildren.
