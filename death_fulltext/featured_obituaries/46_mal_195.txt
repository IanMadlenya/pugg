        Mansur T. Aftab, an entrepreneur who owned decorating companies in New York, New Jersey and Florida, died Friday night when the small plane he was flying crashed as he approached Atlantic City International Airport. He was 65 years old and lived in Hollywood, Fla.
        In 1947 Mr. Aftab came to the United States from Iran, where his family owned a decorating concern. A former resident of Hillsdale, N.J., he owned decorating companies in New York, New Jersey and Florida, which have since been sold. At his death, he owned a Learjet leasing service in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
        He is survived by a son, Adam, of Hollywood, Fla.; two daughters, Parry, of Ridgewood, N.J., and Denna, of Holmdel, N.J.; two brothers, Nasser, of Montvale, N.J., and Amir, of Hallandale, Fla.; two sisters, Pooran, of Hollywood, and Mally Fardisheshe of Teheran, Iran, and two grandsons.
