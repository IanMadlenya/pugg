        He died of lung cancer, his wife said.
        In his four decades with the bank, Mr. Cronenberg began as a bookkeeper, rose swiftly to become an officer and was vice president and treasurer in 1959, when he was promoted to president, succeeding William P. Clark.
        Mr. Cronenberg retired as president in 1970, having served also as chief executive and a director.
        He was president of the Connecticut Bankers Association in 1966 and 1967.
        Mr. Cronenberg was born in Mount Vernon, N.Y., grew up in Norwalk and graduated from Norwalk High School. He studied business and finance at New York University and earned a bachelor's degree.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Janet Jervis Smith of Norwalk, whom he married in 1936; two sons, Richard L. of Cincinnati and David A. of Melbourne, Fla., who is a senior vice president of the First Florida Bank with his office in Orlando; a daughter, Charlene Berardino of New Canaan, Conn., and eight grandchildren.
