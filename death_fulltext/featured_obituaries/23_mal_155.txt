        Massimo Mila, a music critic and historian who fought against the rise of Fascism, died of a heart attack Monday. He was 78 years old.
        Mr. Mila, who taught music history for nearly 30 years at the University of Turin and was a music critic for two national Italian newspapers, joined a group of young Turin intellectuals in 1928 that was opposed to Fascism in Italy. The next year he was arrested for a political demonstration but released after several months.
        Mr. Mila was a courier in the 1930's for the Italian anti-Fascist forces and crossed the Alps on foot to bring documents to Paris. In 1935, he was arrested again and sentenced to seven years in prison.
        After the war, Mr. Mila was a music critic for L'Unita, the Italian Communist Party newspaper, and later wrote on music for La Stampa. Mr. Mila taught music history at the University of Turin and the Conservatory of Music and was the author of several books of music history, including ''A Brief History of Music,'' ''The Musical Experience and Esthetics,'' ''The Art of Verdi,'' ''Stravinsky Companion'' and ''The Costumes of La Traviata.''
