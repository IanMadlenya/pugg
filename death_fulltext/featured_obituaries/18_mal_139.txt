        Joseph Sacco, an advertising man who created several imaginative campaigns in the 1960's, including the Ajax ''White Knight'' and the Lord Calvert whisky ''Man of Distinction,'' died of lung cancer on Sunday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 67 years old.
        Mr. Sacco was one of the first to exploit the power of television to convey a striking visual image that advertisers could turn into a mnemonic device to induce viewers to identify with the product.
        For Ajax cleaner he devised the knight on a charger whose sword flashed white to symbolize household purity. And he gave Lord Calvert the cachet of elegance by linking the whisky to distinguished men (women were not depicted in advertising for hard spirits at the time).
        Mr. Sacco, who was born in Manhattan, was a graduate of City College. He worked for several of the largest Madison Avenue agencies, including Grey Advertising; Norman, Craig & Kummel; Ted Bates, and Young & Rubicam. He was one of the first to take American advertising techniques abroad, working for two years for Papert, Koenig & Lois in London. For many years he taught advertising art and science at the School of Visual Arts in New York.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Hermine Malbin; two sons, Kevin Sacco of Westfield, N.J., and Dr. Joseph Sacco of Los Angeles; two brothers, Peter of New Jersey and Frank of Long Island, and a sister, Mary,of Manhattan.
