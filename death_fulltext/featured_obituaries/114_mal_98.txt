        Alfred L. Plant, an advertising executive who resisted pressure from the National Rifle Association to withdraw his company's ads from a television program critical of hunting, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan  after a brief illness. He was 84.
        Mr. Plant was vice president for advertising and marketing for the Block Drug Company for 23 years, until his retirement in 1977. About 20 years ago, the rifle association pressured sponsors to withdraw ads from the CBS program "The Guns of Autumn," and several did.
        But Mr. Plant refused to pull Block's ads, a decision that earned him tributes from the National Association of Broadcast News Directors and the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.
        Mr. Plant, who was born in Miami Beach, graduated from New York University in 1938. He was an Army officer in World War II, serving in China. He was a member  of numerous advertising and broadcast organizations and belonged to several philanthropic groups. He was the founder of New York's Jewish Repertory Theater  and was on its board for many years.
        His wife, Ann, died about 10 years ago. He is survived by two daughters, Kaaren, of Evanston, Ill., and Marcia Jackson of Indianapolis; his son-in-law, William Jackson; two brothers, Sidney, of Margate, Fla., and Ted, of Walnut Creek, Calif., and two grandchildren.
