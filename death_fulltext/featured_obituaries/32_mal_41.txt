        Joseph Kaskell, an international lawyer who was active in the effort to rebuild Germany after World War II, died Tuesday at his summer home in Madison, N.H. He was 97 years old and also lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Kaskell was an organizer of the American Council on Germany in 1950 and served as its legal counsel until he retired in 1980. Earlier he had been a founder of the Committee for a Democratic Germany, which opposed harsh measures by the Allies that would have restricted the postwar reconstruction of the German economy.
        In 1968 the West German Government in Bonn awarded Mr. Kaskell its highest honor, the Bundesverdienstkreuz, for his efforts in furthering German-American ties.
        Mr. Kaskell, who was born in Posen, Germany (now Poznan, Poland), came to the United States in 1939 after having practiced law in Berlin. After receiving a degree from the Columbia Law School, he resumed practice in New York.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Liselotte Wachter; a son, Peter, of Manhattan; a daughter, Marinne Cohen of Chapel Hill, N.C.; four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
