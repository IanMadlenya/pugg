        Melvin Dixon, a professor of English at Queens College whose works on African and African-American literature were widely praised, died on Monday at his home in Stamford, Conn. He was 42 years old.
        Professor Dixon died of complications from AIDS, said his sister, Cynthia Peters, who also lives in Stamford.
        He was a novelist and poet, wrote a textbook on African-American literature, and translated works from French to English, including The Collected Poems of Leopold Senghor, the longtime president of Senegal, published in 1990 by the University Press of Virginia.
        Mr. Dixon's other books include a volume of poetry, "Change of Territory," published in 1983 by the University Press of Virginia.
        His first novel, "Trouble the Water," published in 1989 by the University of Colorado/Fiction Collective Two, was awarded the Charles H. and N. Mildred Nilon Excellence in Minority Fiction Award in 1989. His second novel, "Vanishing Rooms," was published by NAL-Dutton in 1990.
        Professor Dixon, a native of Stamford, earned a bachelor's degree from Wesleyan University in 1971, and a doctorate from Brown University in 1975. He joined the English faculty at Queens College in 1980.
        In addition to his sister Cynthia, Professor Dixon is survived by his parents, Handy and Jessie Dixon, of Stamford; two brothers, Elliott, of Berkeley, Calif., and Christopher, of Newark, and another sister, Deanna, of Natick, Mass.
