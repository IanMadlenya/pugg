        Gene M. Marshall, one of the marines who helped raise the first American flag on Iwo Jima in World War II, died Tuesday night of burns he suffered in a fire at his home three weeks ago. He was 60 years old.
        Mr. Marshall was a teen-age radio operator with the Fifth Marine Division when it landed on Iwo Jima in 1945 just before one of the bloodiest battles in American military history.
        In that battle, he was a member of a patrol that raised the flag atop an extinct volcano to hearten marines fighting on the north side of the island. But it was soon decided that the flag was too small, and a group of other marines got a larger one. None of the men from the first patrol were in the picture when Joe Rosenthal of The Associated Press photographed the second flag-raising, which became a model for the famous sculpture that now honors the Marine Corps.
