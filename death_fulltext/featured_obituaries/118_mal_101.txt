        William F. Martin, a former chairman and chief executive of the Phillips Petroleum Company who guided the company through a huge expansion, died on Sunday at St. Francis Hospital in Tulsa, Okla.
        He was 79 years old and lived in Bartlesville, Okla.
        Mr. Martin joined Phillips in 1939 as a clerk in the Treasury Department. He brought with him a strong competitive streak that he had honed as a basketball player for the University of Oklahoma and later the Phillips 66ers, a company sponsored team.
        He quickly moved up the ranks at Phillips. In 1965 he was named senior vice president and became chief executive in 1973. He was elected chairman of the board in 1974.
        Mr. Martin oversaw a huge expansion of Phillips's operations, particularly in the North Sea, where in cooperation with the Norwegian Government the company discovered one of the region's first giant offshore oil fields.
        He also transformed the company by carving it up into groups each  responsible for its own profits within the larger company.
        Mr. Martin is survived by his wife, Betty Jean, of Bartlesville; a son, William Scott, of Tulsa, a daughter, Sherry Conger of Oklahoma City, and six grandchildren.
