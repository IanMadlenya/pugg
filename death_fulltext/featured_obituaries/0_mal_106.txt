        A native of Miami, Mr. Powell was reared in New York City, where he attended the High School of Music and Art and studied advertising design at City University. After working and teaching in Syracuse, he returned to New York City in the early 1970's and joined the faculty of Parsons as an instructor in illustration.
        His illustrations were seen in advertisements and articles appearing in national magazines, and his works in sculpture and assemblage have been exhibited in galleries.
