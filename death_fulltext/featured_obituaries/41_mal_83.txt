        Dr. Arthur Mangelsdorff, retired vice president for medical services of the Prudential Insurance Company, died yesterday at Princeton Medical Center. He was 85 years old and lived in Rossmoor, N.J.
        He died of a heart attack, a funeral home spokesman said.
        A graduate of Rutgers University, Dr. Mangelsdorff received a medical degree from the Cornell University School of Medicine. He was a surgeon in Arlington, N.J., and practiced occupational medicine part time. Later, he joined American-Cyanimid, supervising medical units from New England to Texas.
        In 1957 he joined Prudential in charge of employee health and took over Medicare administration for the State of New Jersey. In 1969 he retired from Prudential, but was later asked to help control the Medicare operation and to inspect hospitals by the New Jersey State Department of Health. He did so until 1975 when he retired.
        He had been president of the New Jersey Industrial Medical Society, president of the Academy of Medicine of New Jersey, and president of the American Academy of Occupational Medicine.
        Dr. Mangelsdorff is survived by his wife, the former Maesie Rowland; a son, A. David, of San Antonio, and a sister, Mildred Elsner of Martinsville, N.J.
