        E. Ralph Lacey, a naval architect and marine engineer who in a 41-year career with the Navy specialized in the preliminary design of submarines, died on Friday at the Saybrook Convalescent Home in Old Saybrook, Conn. He was 78 years old and lived in Lyme, Conn.
        Mr. Lacey played a critical role in the design of Navy submarines from the end of World War II through the 1960's. He worked on the Nautilus, the first nuclear-powered submarine, and the Albacore, a high-powered test vessel that was faster than other attack submarines and set the pattern for later models.
        He also worked on the Polaris and on the design of hydrofoils and air-cushion vehicles.
        Mr. Lacey was born in Portland, Ore., and joined the Navy in 1935 after graduating from the Webb Institute of Naval Engineering in Glen Cove, L.I. He retired in 1976. Surviving are his wife, the former Mary Connors; a son, Willliam, of Alexandria, Va.; a daughter, Ann Evans of Niantic, Conn.; three sisters, Irene Stahlin of Chester Depot, Vt., Gertrude Thornton of Jacksonville, Fla., and Jean Patterson of Pearl River, N.Y., and four grandchildren.
