        Dr. Robert W. Kistner, a Harvard Medical School professor who specialized in the treatment of endometriosis, a condition of the uterus that can cause infertility in women, was found dead Tuesday at his home at the Palm Beach Polo and Country Club in Wellington, Fla., where he lived in retirement. He was 72 years old.
        The Palm Beach County Medical Examiner's office said Dr. Kistner had committed suicide by cutting his wrists.
        Dr. Kistner, a gynecologist, was an early advocate of the birth-control pill as a contraceptive and as a preventative for cancer of the womb. Endometriosis results when the lining of the uterus grows beyond its natural boundaries.
        Dr. Kistner was born in Cincinnati and was a graduate of the University of Cincinnati and its Medical School. He was an associate clinical professor at Harvard and a senior attending physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. He retired in 1986.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Janet Langhart; a daughter, Dana Wyss of Scottsdale, Ariz.; three sons, Robert Jr. of Alamo, Calif., Stephen of Dover, Mass., and Peter of Tucson, Ariz.; a sister, Shirley Anderson of Sarasota, Fla., and eight grandchildren.
