        Yevgeny I. Tolstikov, a Soviet explorer who led several pioneering expeditions to the Antarctic, died Friday, the official Soviet press agency Tass reported today. He was 74 years old.
        Tass said Dr. Tolstikov died after an unspecified long and serious illness.
        Dr. Tolstikov gained renown during World War II for his polar flights and later made several geographical discoveries in the Arctic and Antarctic, Tass said. He headed the third Soviet expedition to the Antarctic and trained many other Soviet polar explorers, the agency said.
        Dr. Tolstikov was made deputy chief of the Soviet Northern Sea Route Administration after he commanded an Arctic ice island post in the mid-1950's. In late 1957, he led a Soviet expedition to the Antarctic to celebrate the International Geophysical Year.
        From 1979, he was deputy chairman of the State Committee for Hydrometeorolgy and Environmental Control, and from 1986 was editor in chief of the journal Meteorologiya i Gidrologiya.
        He held several high-rankng scientific and other positions and was vice president of the official Friendship Society with Norway.
