        A native of England, Dr. Gampell was a physician there for five years before emigrating in 1949 to the United States. While practicing medicine, he studied law at Stanford University Law School and graduated in 1957. He was elected president of the California Bar Association in 1976.
        In 1977, as a member of the bar's board of governors, he supported Rose Bird as the first woman to become Chief Justice of the California Supreme Court. He was named administrative director of the courts shortly thereafter and retired in 1986.
        He is survived by his wife, Margaret Gampell, of Palo Alto; a daughter, Jennifer; and two sons, David and Richard, all of the San Francisco area.
