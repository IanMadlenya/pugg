        Jean-Louis Morin, a former principal dancer with the Martha Graham Dance Company and a choreographer, died on May 24 at Montreal General Hospital in Montreal. He was 42 and lived in Montreal.
        The cause was AIDS, said Doneley Meris, a friend.
        Mr. Morin trained at the Groupe de la Place Royale and with the National Ballet of Canada and joined the London Contemporary Dance Theater in 1974. He was a soloist with the Toronto Dance Theater in 1977 and with the Louis Falco Dance Company in New York City in 1978 and 1979. He choreographed his first dances in the late 1970's.
        Mr. Morin performed with the Graham company from 1979 to 1986, in dances that included "Frescos," "Embattled Garden" and "Deaths and Entrances." He also starred in "Narcissus," a film directed by Norman McLaren and choreographed by Fernand Nault. In New York City, he appeared with the Martha Clarke Theater Group and Elisa Monte. He performed solo concerts in Montreal, and also taught at several studios there through 1993.
        Mr. Morin was also a painter and sculptor, whose works were shown in galleries in New York City, Montreal and Toronto.
        He is survived by his mother, Rachele Cote-Dalzell, of Montreal.
