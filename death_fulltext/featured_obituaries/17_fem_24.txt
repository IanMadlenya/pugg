        Sallie Martin, a singer who was known as ''the mother of gospel music,'' died Saturday. She was 92 years old.
        Mrs. Martin started singing in a Baptist church. Her search for work brought her to Cleveland and then Chicago where, in 1932, she teamed with the Rev. Thomas M. Dorsey.
        She sang Mr. Dorsey's syncopated hymns at churches and meeting halls throughout the South. After performances, she sold sheet music for 10 cents a copy.
        Mrs. Martin was featured in the documentary film ''Say Amen, Somebody.''
