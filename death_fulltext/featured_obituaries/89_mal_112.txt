        Rudulph Ellis Carter, a former Foreign Service officer and a political adviser in the United States Mission to the United Nations, died last Tuesday in Newport Hospital in Rhode Island. A summer resident of Newport, he was 68 and lived in Dallas.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Carter joined the State Department in 1951. His foreign assignments included Stockholm and London. During his time at the United Nations from 1969 to 1977, he served as an aide to George Bush when he was the American delegate to the United Nations.
        A native of Bryn Mawr, Pa., Mr. Carter graduated from the Groton School and the University of Pennsylvania.
        He was president of the United States Croquet Association, representing 350 clubs in North America. He served as United States representative to the World Croquet Federation in London and in 1992 helped to bring the World Championships to this country for the first time. He was elected to the Croquet Hall of Fame in April.
        Mr. Carter is survived by his wife, Mary McLain Carter; a daughter, Cintra E. Carter of Milan, Italy; a son, Michael R. E. of Greenwich, Conn.; and a sister, Centra C. Sander of Princeton, N.J.
