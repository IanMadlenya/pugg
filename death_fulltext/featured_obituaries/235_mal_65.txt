        James W. Smith Jr., a noted surgeon who recreated a forbidden childhood paradise by amassing one of the finest collections of antique penny arcade games in the country, died on Aug. 15 in Greenwich, Conn. He was 79 and had for many years made his home in Greenwich, less than a mile down the road from the barn that once housed his whirring, blinking, clinking Eden.
        Dr. Smith died after having a stroke the day before, his family said.
        A plastic surgeon, Dr. Smith was a clinical professor of surgery at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center. He was also the medical director and chief executive of the Center for Specialty Care, which he founded in the late 1970's. The center, on East 69th Street in Manhattan, is a free-standing ambulatory surgery center.
        From the late 19th century to the mid-20th, coin-operated games and similar machines were a staple of popular entertainment in arcades, shops and saloons across the United States. For a penny -- in later years a nickel -- patrons could test their strength, learn their fortune or play a game of chance in the hope of winning a gumball, a pack of tobacco or, best of all, a shower of coins.
        Today, collectors of American folk art prize early arcade games as emblems of the national past. Dr. Smith displayed his collection, which numbered well over a thousand items, in his barn (admission by invitation only) from 1982 until 1994. That year, it was sold at Sotheby's in New York for more than $3.3 million.
        Like so many men and women of his generation, Dr. Smith first saw the magical machines in childhood. James Walter Smith Jr. was born on Oct. 29, 1926, in East Liverpool, Ohio. Just across the Ohio River, in Chester, W.Va., Rock Springs amusement park beckoned.
        James's father, James Walter Sr., was a pillar of the community, a banker and churchgoer. But he was not averse to good, clean fun, and the family visited Rock Springs Park often. Each time, young James Jr. was steered firmly toward the carousel and other wholesome pursuits. Each time, as soon as his parents lost track of him, he slipped away to the gaudy clangor of the penny arcade.
        There was worse to come. By the time he was a teenager, James Jr. was frequenting the local pool hall, where he played coin-operated baseball and horse-racing games. To his father, as Dr. Smith later recalled in interviews, this was as good as gambling, the first big step on the road to the depths of degradation.
        ''What were you doing in there sinning?'' the elder Mr. Smith would bellow as he swooped down on the pool hall just long enough to extract his son by the ear.
        The son turned respectable. He served two years in the Navy; earned an undergraduate degree in 1948 from Adelbert College, later part of Case Western Reserve University; and in 1952 received an M.D. degree from Columbia.
        Dr. Smith became a prominent surgeon with a string of publications to his credit, was sent by the State Department to research leprosy in India and gained recognition for his work in hand reconstruction. Little by little, he forgot about the penny arcade.
        One day in the mid-1960's, though, Dr. Smith's wife, Nancy, gave him a present from a secondhand shop: an antique penny-drop game in which the player sends a coin rattling down through a labyrinth of nails. She knew nothing of her husband's past. Soon, the family was scouring the country for old arcade machines.
        Their house became a cabinet of wonders. There were machines that sprayed perfume and machines that described a person's future mate. There were machines that dispensed candy and machines that dispensed collar buttons. There were one-armed bandits and early forms of pinball. Around the house lay brimming bowls of pennies and nickels. The five Smith children were all hugely popular.
        Dr. Smith was especially partial to the lung testers, into which patrons blew to gauge their pulmonary strength. (The machines fell out of favor in the early 20th century, when they were found to be a superb means of spreading tuberculosis.) There were also shock machines, which delivered a vigorous electric jolt, touted as curing a variety of 19th-century ills. These were a particular favorite of the children.
        Before long, the machines outgrew the Smiths' house, and their porch, garage, summer home, two rented trailers and a neighbor's home. By the 1970's, when Dr. Smith bought his barn, the collection had expanded to include musical devices as well as circus and carnival memorabilia.
        The barn was a riot of color and noise. ''JEANNIE THE HALF-GIRL!'' shrieked one banner. ''HO-JO THE OSTRICH MAN!'' screamed another. A lifelike trapeze artist hung from the rafters. Below was a mechanical belly dancer from Palisades Amusement Park in New Jersey.
        Music poured from a calliope or a Wurlitzer organ or from a rare ''Violano-Virtuoso,'' an automated contraption that played two violins and a piano at once. Games were everywhere: ''TEST YOUR GRIP!'' ''INSTANT DEATH!'' ''LET MADAME ZITA TELL YOUR FORTUNE, 1Â›!''
        Dr. Smith, who with his sons loved to turn his surgical skills on his machines, also employed a full-time restorer and a curator. He sold the collection when it became too costly to maintain.
        In his other life, Dr. Smith wrote several books, including '' 'Doctor, Make Me Beautiful!' '' (McKay, 1973; with Samm Sinclair Baker). He was the editor, with William C. Grabb, of ''Plastic Surgery: A Concise Guide to Clinical Practice,'' first published in 1968 and released in its fourth edition (Little, Brown; with Sherrell J. Aston) in 1991.
        Besides his wife, the former Nancy Keck, whom he married in 1954, Dr. Smith is survived by their children, Lucinda Smith Hay of London; Judith Smith Fairbanks of Springfield, Mo.; James III of Potomac, Md.; Constance Smith Plimpton of Sherborn, Mass.; and Peter of Menlo Park, Calif.; and 11 grandchildren.
        All of the Smith children keep several of their father's arcade games at home. They credit the machines with helping cultivate horse sense and a cool head and a keen eye.
        ''We would play the games of skill all the time,'' James Smith III said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. ''That's where I learned that gambling was not a good thing, because I sat down in front of the slot machine with a bowl of pennies, and at the end of the day, I'd have no money.''
        He paused a moment before adding, ''Fortunately, I had the keys to the back.''
