        Peter Gladke, a dancer and choreographer who worked closely with June Taylor, the television choreographer, died last Sunday at a family birthday party at a relative's home in Yonkers. He was 74 and had homes in Manhattan and Miami.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Carol Ann Cefola, his niece.
        Mr. Gladke was born in Yonkers and joined the United States Coast Guard after graduating from high school; he got his first dancing job as a jitterbug dancer in "Tars and Spars," a revue that toured military bases. After his discharge, he got a job as a dancer at the Latin Quarter nightclub and went on to work at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival.
        He danced with Ballet Theater in the 1940's and also worked with Jack Cole and Ms. Taylor, serving as her assistant choreographer on "The Jackie Gleason Show" from 1962 to 1971. He also worked with her on "The Ed Sullivan Show" and danced on Broadway, in films and on television.
        In addition to Ms. Cefola, one of six nieces and nephews, Mr. Gladke is survived by two brothers, Mike, of Yonkers, and Nick, of Spofford, N.H.
