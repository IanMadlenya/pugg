        Craig Russell, who delighted and sometimes shocked audiences with his impersonations of Mae West, Judy Garland and Peggy Lee, died Tuesday night at Toronto Western Hospital. He was 42 years old.
        He died of a stroke resulting from AIDS, said Lucie Baistrocchi, a spokeswoman for the hospital.
        Born in Toronto, Mr. Russell became interested in show business after meeting Miss West in 1965. At the age of 17, he moved into her house in Los Angeles and worked as her part-time secretary. He left several months later, apparently after a dispute, and returned to Toronto to study hairdressing. He remained a devoted fan, however, and years later the walls of his apartment remained covered with memorabilia given to him by the actress.
        He made his first stage appearance in 1970 when he impersonated Tallulah Bankhead at a gay club in Toronto. For years he was among the best-known female impersonators in North America.
        His performance in the 1977 film "Outrageous," in which he played a flamboyant drag queen, won Mr. Russell the awards for both best actor and best actress at the Virgin Islands Film Festival. He also was named best actor at the Berlin Film Festival for the role.
        His career soured when a four-city tour of Western Canada in 1981 was canceled after Mr. Russell undressed onstage and threw wigs and jewelry at the audience. He was later barred from a talk show in Vancouver.
        Mr. Russell recently released a record album featuring a song titled "Glamour Monster." Gino Empry, his manager and publicity agent, said profits from the record will go to AIDS research.
        Mr. Russell is survived by his wife, Lori Jenkins, a fan whom he married in 1982.
