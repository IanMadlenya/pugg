        Ron Bottcher, a baritone who sang with the Metropolitan Opera and the New York City Opera, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital. He was 50 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of AIDS, a friend, Dennis McGovern, said.
        Mr. Bottcher was born in Sandpoint, Idaho. He attended the University of Montana and also studied at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia before making his professional debut in "La Boheme" with the Santa Fe Opera.
        After making his debut with the New York City Opera in 1963, Mr. Bottcher appeared as Escamillo in "Carmen" and as Sharpless in "Madama Butterfly," among other roles. His appearances at the Metropolitan Opera included roles in "Antony and Cleopatra" and "Mourning Becomes Electra."
        He is survived by his mother, Lucille, and a brother, Greg, both of Sandpoint.
