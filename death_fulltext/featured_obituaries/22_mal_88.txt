        Primo Conti, the last major surviving figure of Italy's futurist school of painting, died today, the Italian news agencies reported. He was 88 years old.
        The artist died at his home in Fiesole, outside Florence. The cause of his death was not announced.
        Mr. Conti taught himself to paint as a teen-ager and was active in the futurist movement after World War I. The futurists drew on cubist techniques to communicate movement, and their work stressed the speed and dynamic nature of the machine age.
        Mr. Conti later took up a more classical style, but he returned to some futurist principles after World War II.
        The painter also published poetry and an autobiography. In 1985 he set up a foundation dedicated to avant-garde movements. Mr. Conti leaves his wife and two daughters.
