        Chih-Han Sah, a theoretical mathematician at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, died on July 22 at University Hospital in Stony Brook. He was 62 and lived in Setauket, N.Y.
        He suffered a brief illness, his family said.
        Among his peers, Dr. Sah was best known for his work with finite groups, or algebraic sets of symmetries. He wrote a famously challenging text on algebraic number theory, ''Abstract Algebra'' (Academic Press, 1967), as well as some 40 scientific papers.
        He also organized Internet exchanges with other leading mathematicians on mathematics teaching in primary and secondary schools.
        He was born in Beijing and moved  to the United States in 1949. He graduated from the University of Illinois and in 1959 received his Ph.D. in mathematics from Harvard University. He taught at Princeton University, Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania before he joined the SUNY faculty at Stony Brook as a professor of mathematics in 1970.
        Dr. Sah is survived by his wife of 33 years, Analee Sah; two sons, Adam, of Berkeley, Calif., and Jason, of Los Angeles; a daughter, Deborah Sah of Providence, R.I.; and a brother, Chi-Tang Sah of Gainesville, Fla.
