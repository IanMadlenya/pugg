        William Hamilton Hoge, an early manufacturer of television sets and the first large-screen projection TV sets, died of a heart attack on Friday at his home in Southampton, L.I. He was 83 years old and also had a residence in Manhattan.
        Mr. Hoge, who was born in Boston and graduated from Williams College, was a scientific entrepreneur. He founded United States Television, which made an early TV set consisting of a phonograph, a multiband radio and a television receiver in one cabinet.
        He later started Pan Controls, which made pollution-control equipment, including a system for neutralizing the nitric acids used in manufacturing newsprint. Mr. Hoge recently founded a company to produce lithographs of marine and sporting subjects.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Sarah Collins; a son, James Hamilton Hoge, of Southampton; three daughters, Cecile Havemeyer of Bridgehampton, Cynthia Hoge of Corwin Springs, Mont., and Daphne Hoge of Manhattan; a brother, Cecil Hoge of Oldfield, N.Y.; a sister, Barbara Obolensky of Southampton, and three grandchildren.
