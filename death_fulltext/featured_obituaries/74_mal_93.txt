        Robert F. Gilkeson, retired chairman and chief executive of the Philadelphia Electric Company, died Saturday in Sun City, Ariz., where he had moved a few years ago. A former resident of Wayne, Pa., he was 75.
        The company said his death came after a long illness.
        A native of Philadelphia, Mr. Gilkeson received a degree in engineering from Cornell University in 1939. He joined Philadelphia Electric that year as a cadet engineer and rose through the ranks, playing a prominent role in the development of commercial nuclear energy.
        He became president in 1965, added the title of chief executive five years later and was named chairman in 1971. He retired in 1982 but continued as chairman of the executive committee until five years ago.
        Active in civic affairs, he was a trustee of the Philadelphia Port Corporation and a director of the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce and the Old Philadelphia Development Corporation.
        Mr. Gilkeson's first wife, the former Marie L. Whitwell, died in 1985. He is survived by his wife, Nancy; two daughters, Katherine Gilkeson Hughes of Lakewood, Colo., and Elizabeth Gilkeson Aikens of Devon, Pa.; three sons, Richard of Portland, Ore., Thomas of Gastonia, N.C., and David of Houston, and 10 grandchildren.
