        Louis Kievman, a violist who performed with the Musical Art Quartet in the 1930's, died on Tuesday at his home in Pacific Palisades, Calif. He was 80 years old.
        His daughter, Mura Kievman Mager, said he died of pancreatic cancer.
        Mr. Kievman was born in Naugatuck, Conn., on Aug. 13, 1910, and studied with the violinists Franz Kniesel and Jascha Jacobsen at the Institute of Musical Art in New York City. Upon his graduation in 1932, he switched to viola from violin. In addition to the Musical Art Quartet, he also performed with the New Friends of Rhythm, a jazz ensemble, and the Stuyvesant Quartet.  He was also a member of Arturo Toscanini's NBC Symphony.
        During the 1940's, he began touring as a soloist, and moved to Los Angeles, where he worked as a studio musician and taught.
        He is survived by his wife, Elaine Larson Kievman; two daughters, Mrs. Mager, of Brooklyn Heights, and Karen Bruderlin, of Los Angeles, and a granddaughter.
