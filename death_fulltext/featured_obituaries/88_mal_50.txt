        Dr. Emanuel Goldberger, a cardiologist who practiced in Manhattan and Westchester County for more than 40 years until he retired last year, died on Saturday at Jupiter Hospital in Jupiter, Fla. He was 81 and had homes in Scarsdale, N.Y., and Singer Island, Fla.
        He suffered a lengthy illness, his family said.
        He was born in the Bronx and graduated from City College and Downstate Medical School in Brooklyn. In addition to his practice, for many years, he was an attending cardiologist at Montefiore Hospital and the hospital of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and taught at New York Medical College in Valhalla, N.Y.
        He contributed to the advance of electrocardiography and the augmented leads used in ECG machines. He had a reputation as a medical researcher and was the author of textbooks in cardiology that were translated into other languages. Unlike many private practitioners, he continued to make house calls.
        Dr. Goldberger is survived by his wife of 53 years, Blanche Rubin Goldberger; two sons, Richard of Salt Lake City and Dr. Ary of Newton Centre, Mass.; a sister, Sylvia Goldberger of Riverdale, the Bronx, and two grandsons.
