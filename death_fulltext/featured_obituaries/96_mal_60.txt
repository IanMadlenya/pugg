        Dr. Victor Goodhill, an ear surgeon who helped found clinics and advocacy groups for the hearing-impaired, died on Dec. 26 at his home in Los Angeles. He was 83.
        The cause was heart disease, said Christine Coleman, executive director of the Hope for Hearing Foundation-U.C.L.A., an advocacy group the doctor founded in 1957.
        Dr. Goodhill had established a private practice and begun teaching at the University of Southern California in the late 1930's when he became involved with the John Tracy Clinic, a private institution named for the deaf son of the actor Spencer Tracy. He served on the advisory board of the clinic and encouraged its development as a school for hearing-impaired children. The clinic treats patients worldwide and distributes correspondence courses.
        In 1984, in recognition of his work for people with impaired hearing, U.C.L.A. established the Victor Goodhill Ear Center to study hearing and balance disorders.
        In 1980, Dr. Goodhill wrote the medical textbook "Ear Diseases: Deafness and Dizziness," which is now being revised and will be published by Lippincott as "The Goodhill Textbook of Otology."
        Dr. Goodhill received a medical degree from the University of Southern California in 1936 and taught there until 1960, when he joined the faculty of U.C.L.A. He retired in 1984.
        He is survived by his wife of 58 years, Ruth; a son, Dean; a daughter, Barbara Ockwell, and a sister, Fay Fox, all of Los Angeles, and four grandchildren.
