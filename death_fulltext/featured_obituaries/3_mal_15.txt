        Mr. Watt, who was born in Edinburgh and was a descendant of James Watt, the inventor who pioneered the development of the steam engine, graduated from Marlborough College and Oxford University and began his career in the early 1950's with The Spectator.
        In that same decade, he also worked for The Scotsman and as the Common Market correspondent of The Daily Herald. In the early 1960's he joined the staff of The Financial Times and became its first full-time correspondent in Washington, from 1964 to 1967.
        The next year he returned to London, where for the next decade he served as a political editor and columnist of The Financial Times. In 1977, he left journalism to become director for the next five years of the Royal Institute of International Affairs. Most recently, he wrote a political column once a week for The Times of London.
        Mr. Watt is survived by his wife, Susanne, and four sons.
