        Carlos Nunez Tellez, a Government leader in Nicaragua in the 10 years of control by the leftist Sandinista Front, died today in Havana, the main Sandinista radio station, Radio Ya, said. He was 39 years old.
        Mr. Nunez, who went to Cuba in January for radiation treatment of an undisclosed illness, died of heart failure, a spokesman for the party, Dionisio Marenco, said.
        Mr. Nunez was one of the nine commanders on the National Directorate of the Sandinista National Liberation Front and was president of the National Assembly.
        The Sandinistas lost control of the Assembly in elections on Feb. 25, but Mr. Nunez was re-elected. He was seen only at the opening session, after the Government of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro took office on April 25 in the wake of its defeat of President Daniel Ortega Saavedra.
        Mr. Nunez joined the Sandinista Front in 1969, when it was underground, with his brother Rene and received guerrilla training abroad. He joined the directorate in March 1979, four months before the front toppled the right-wing dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza Debayle. Mr. Nunez directed sabotage and agitation during the battle for Managua.
        Surviving are his wife, Milu Vargas, who was also re-elected to the National Assembly, and four children.
