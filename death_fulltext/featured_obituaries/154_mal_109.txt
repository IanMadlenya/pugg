        Robert Bingham, the author of a collection of short stories and a member of the prominent Kentucky newspaper publishing family, died Sunday at his home in TriBeCa in Manhattan. He was 33.
        The cause of death is under investigation, said Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the Office of the City's Chief Medical Examiner. The police said they found no signs of foul play.
        Mr. Bingham's first novel, ''Lightning on the Sun,'' is scheduled for release by Doubleday Broadway in May. In a review of Mr. Bingham's 1997 short story collection, ''Pure Slaughter Value,'' Gardner McFall wrote in The New York Times Book Review that his stories dealt with ''men in their 20's and 30's gripped by an indefinable, irremediable malaise.'' He praised Mr. Bingham for evoking ''the contemporary scene with acute observational powers and clean, reportorial prose,'' though he called the characters ''curiously unsympathetic.'' Mr. Bingham's editor at Doubleday Broadway, Gerald Howard, said the writer's forthcoming novel was a literary thriller.
        Mr. Bingham, whose first short story appeared in The New Yorker when he was 26, helped found and edit Open City, a new literary magazine.
        He graduated from Brown University in 1988 and received a master of fine arts degree from Columbia University in 1994. He worked for two years as a reporter for The Cambodia Daily in Phnom Penh.
        Mr. Bingham was born in Louisville, Ky., where his family owned The Courier-Journal and The Louisville Times. His father was the assistant publisher of both papers; his grandfather, the late Barry Bingham Sr., was the editor and publisher. His great-grandfather, Judge Robert Worth Bingham, was ambassador to Britain from 1933 to 1937.
        Mr. Bingham is survived by his wife, Vanessa Chase, whom he married in May; his mother, Joan Bingham of New York City and Washington, and his sister, Clara Bingham, of Washington.
