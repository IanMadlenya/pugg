        Prof. Nathan Susskind, a retired teacher of German and Jewish studies at City College and an authority on Yiddish, died on Thursday in Overlook Hospital in Summit, N.J. He was 87 and lived in West Palm Beach, Fla.
        Professor Susskind taught at City College from 1932 until his retirement in 1974. He was also a director of the Institute for Yiddish Lexicology at the City University of New York. The institute was founded to create the Great Dictionary of the Yiddish Language, of which four volumes have appeared.
        He was the supervisor of the dictionary project for some years, and later he and Prof. Marvin I. Herzog of Columbia University were its co-supervisors.
        Professor Herzog, who is now Atran Professor Emeritus of Yiddish Studies at Columbia, said yesterday that Professor Susskind's doctoral dissertation, on a Yiddish epic poem of the 16th century, "cast new light on the Yiddish literature of the period." Origins of Yiddish
        Professor Susskind also wrote many articles and was particularly interested in the origins and development of Yiddish.
        He was born in Slovakia, came to New York as a teen-ager and received bachelor's and master's degrees from City College and a Ph.D. from New York University.
        Professor Susskind's 1933 marriage to Rose Finkler ended in divorce. In 1956, he married Matilda Blau, who died after 30 years of marriage. In 1989, he remarried his first wife, who died on July 9.
        He is survived by two children, who are both psychotherapists, Dr. Fay Tassoff of West Caldwell, N.J., and Dr. Edwin Susskind of Pittsburgh; and six grandchildren.
