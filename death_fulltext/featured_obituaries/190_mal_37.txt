        William Packard, a poet, novelist, playwright, editor and founder of The New York Quarterly, a national poetry magazine, died on Nov. 3 at his home in Manhattan. He was 69.
        He died of heart disease, said Raymond Hammond, executive editor of the quarterly.
        Mr. Packard founded The New York Quarterly in 1969. It published both poems and interviews, and contributors included prominent poets like W. H. Auden, John Ashbery, Paul Blackburn, Richard Eberhart, Stanley Kunitz, Anne Sexton and W. S. Merwin, among many others.
        The magazine suspended publication in 1996 when Mr. Packard had a stroke, but he was sufficiently recovered earlier this year to help bring out the fall issue, which has just been published. The magazine will continue, Mr. Hammond said.
        Mr. Packard also taught creative writing at New York University, the New School, Cooper Union and elsewhere and wrote in a variety of forms.
        Mr. Packard's six volumes of poetry include ''To Peel an Apple'' (1963) and ''Voices: I Hear Voices'' (1972).
        His adaptation of Racine's ''Ph√®dre'' won the Outer Critics Circle Award when it was produced Off Broadway in 1966.
        He also wrote textbooks on writing and published three collections of one-act plays.
        Born on Sept. 2, 1933, and raised in New York City, Mr. Packard graduated from Stanford University.
        He has no immediate survivors.
