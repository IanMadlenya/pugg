        Charles Wolf, a diamond merchant, died on April 6 at Beth Israel Hospital. He was 90 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of a heart attack, said his grandson Clifford.
        Mr. Wolf came to the United States from Antwerp, Belgium, in 1940 and established Charles Wolf & Sons, a Manhattan-based importer and wholesaler of diamonds. He was the firm's president at his death.
        Mr. Wolf was active in the Zionist movement and helped refugees from central and eastern Europe move to Israel through Antwerp in the late 1930's. He was a board member of the American Committee of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, and treasurer of the Zionist Organization of America. He was on the board of the United Jewish Appeal and a member of the New York Board of Rabbis.
        He is survived by his wife, Julia; two sons, Jacques and Leon, both of Manhattan; four grandsons, and eight great-grandchildren.
