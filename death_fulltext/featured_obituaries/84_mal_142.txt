        Dr. Eugene Kamenka, an Australian philosopher and social thinker, died last Wednesday in his home in Canberra. He was 65.
        The cause was bone cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Kamenka was regarded as a leading post-World War II interpreter of modern European philosophical ideas, especially those related to radical and revolutionary social movements.
        Dr. Kamenka was a professor of philosophy at the Australian National University in Canberra and the director of its History of Ideas Unit, a center for the study of the major social, legal and political ideas of the last 200 years.
        His best-known scholarly work was "The Ethical Foundations of Marxism," published in 1962. In recent years his research and writings concentrated on the collapse of systems of thought that had 18th-century origins.
        Together with his wife, Alice Ehr-Soon Tay, who is professor of jurisprudence at Sydney University, Dr. Kamenka wrote several works on the philosophy of law and comparative legal systems.
        He is survived by his wife and two children by a previous marriage.
