        Francis S. Kinney, a naval architect and authority on yacht design, died Monday at the Nesconset Nursing Center in Nesconset, L.I. He was 77 and had lived in Lloyd Harbor, L.I., for more than 50 years.
        Mr. Kinney died of complications from Alzheimer's disease, said a son, Jeremy F. Kinney, of Denver.
        Francis Kinney was a member of the naval architectural firm of Sparkman & Stephens in Manhattan for more than 30 years. He was the author of the seventh and eighth editions of "Skene's Elements of Yacht Design," one of the standard texts on naval architecture. Under Mr. Kinney's authorship, the seventh edition was published by Dodd, Mead & Company in 1962 and the eighth in 1973.
        Mr. Kinney also wrote "You Are First," the story of the Sparkman & Stephens firm, which from the late 1950's to the 1980's designed most of the 12-Meter yachts that defended the America's Cup.
        Born in Manhattan, he graduated from Princeton University in 1938 with a degree in architecture.
        In addition to his son, Jeremy, Mr. Kinney is survived by his wife of 52 years, Mary Fowler Kinney; two daughters, Anne Duffy of New Vernon, N.J., and Beatrice Broadwater of Manhattan; another son, Christopher, of Manhattan; a sister, Joan Kinney Gengler of Southport, Conn., and seven grandchildren.
