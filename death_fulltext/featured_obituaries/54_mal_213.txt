        Brother Benedict Francis Rolston of the Christian Schools, who served in the order for nearly six decades and was a professor at Manhattan College, died on Wednesday at his home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. He was 74 years old.
        He died of respiratory and cardiac arrest, a spokesman for the order said.
        Brother Rolston, a native New Yorker, attended Catholic University and taught at several Roman Catholic schools before joining the Manhattan College faculty in 1955. He taught mathematics, physics and religious studies, and from 1972 to 1977 served as sub-director of the Brothers of the Christian Schools.
        He is survived by two brothers, John and Bernard, and four sisters, Anna Bruder, Mary Taggart, Rose O'Neill and Bernice Jaycard.
