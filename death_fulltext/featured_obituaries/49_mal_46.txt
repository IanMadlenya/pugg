        Carroll Carroll, a writer for some of radio's best-known comedians, died on Tuesday at his home in West Hollywood, Calif. He was 88 years old.
        He died of congestive heart failure, said his son, Bruce.
        Among the comedians for whom Mr. Carroll wrote during the 1930's and 40's were George Burns and Gracie Allen, Eddie Cantor and Bert Lahr. He also wrote for Rudy Vallee, Al Jolson and Bing Crosby and is credited with having created Bing Crosby's low-key radio personality.
