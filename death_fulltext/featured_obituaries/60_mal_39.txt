        James F. Simms, an official of the United States Olympic Committee and the Amateur Athletic Union for more than a half-century, died of heart disease on Monday in Point Pleasant (N.J.) Hospital. He was 86 years old.
        He lived in Manasquan, N.J., until he was confined four years ago to a nursing home.
        Mr. Simms was born in Jersey City and graduated from a commercial high school there at age 15. He immediately started working for the A.A.U. national office in Manhattan, and soon became assistant secretary of the U.S.O.C. in the adjoining office. Except for 1964, when he had eye problems, he served United States teams at every Summer Olympics from 1924 to 1976.
        At 18, he was assistant secretary to the 1924 United States Olympic delegation in Paris, and he was the assistant to Gen. Douglas MacArthur, the head of the 1928 United States Olympic delegation in Amsterdam.
        From 1924 to 1976, he assisted a close friend, Dan Ferris, the meet director of the A.A.U. national indoor track and field championships. In 1958, he succeeded Mr. Ferris as secretary-treasurer of the A.A.U., and in 1961 he became the A.A.U's treasurer emeritus.
        He is survived by a sister, Madelon Simms of Manasquan.
