        C. Harold Kidwell, a chemical engineer and the founder of the Reduction Engineering Corporation of Newark, died on Friday at Overlook Hospital in Summit, N.J. He was 95 years old and lived in Short Hills, N.J.
        He died of kidney and heart failure, said his daughter Otis Kidwell Burger of Manhattan.
        Mr. Kidwell, a graduate of the University of Kansas, worked for the United States Geological Survey during World War I, testing water at Army campsites.
        He later joined the Solvay Corporation, a chemical company in Syracuse. After developing machinery and a method of fine-grinding powders used in paints, cosmetics and chemicals, he formed his own company, Reduction Engineering, in 1939. The company also ground optical lenses and components for bombsights. He licensed his grinding methods to scores of companies in the United States and in Europe. He retired in 1978 because of failing eyesight.
        In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his wife, Norma; a son, Dr. Allyn Kidwell of Ridgewood, N.J.; another daughter, Emily, of Yorktown Heights, N.Y.; a stepdaughter, Sara Swann Miller of High Falls, N.Y., and seven grandchildren.
