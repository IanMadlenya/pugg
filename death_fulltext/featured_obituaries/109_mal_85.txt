        David Rae Smith, a baritone with the New York City Opera since 1962, died on  Wednesday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. He was 65.
        The cause was lung cancer, a spokeswoman for the City Opera said.
        Mr. Smith made his debut with the company in 1962 as Bill Bobstay in "H. M.  S. Pinafore." He also appeared in City Opera productions of "The Merry Widow," "Patience," "Die Fledermaus," "The Desert Song" and "The Student Prince." He performed with other opera companies around the country, including the Houston Grand Opera, where he sang in "Der Rosenkavalier" and in the premieres of Vaughan Williams's "Hugh the Drover" and Thomas Pasatieri's "Seagull."
        He also toured nationally in productions of "Hello, Dolly!," "South Pacific," "Can-Can," "Annie Get Your Gun" and "The Phantom of the Opera."
        Mr. Smith was born in Ashville, N.C., and attended the University of Illinois.
        No immediate family members survive.
