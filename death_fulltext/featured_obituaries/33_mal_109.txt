        Sim Var, founder of the Cambodian Democratic Party and a former Prime Minister, has died in Paris, according to a statement issued on Saturday. He was 85 years old.
        The statement, issued by the Movement for the Support of Khmer Liberty, did not give the date of his death or any other details.
        Mr. Sim, who had lived in Paris since the Khmer Rouge took power in Cambodia in 1975, served in several ministerial posts under Prince Norodom Sihanouk after Cambodia's independence in 1954. In 1957, he led Cambodia's Council of Ministers, but his Government fell the next year over economic issues.
        At the time that the Khmer Rouge began their violent four-year rule, Mr. Sim was serving as Ambassador to Tokyo.
