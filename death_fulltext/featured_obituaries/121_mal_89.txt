        Darold Dobs, the executive director of the American Bowling Congress, died in Milwaukee on Feb. 10. He was 54.
        The cause was cancer, the congress said.
        Mr. Dobs took over leadership of the A.B.C., the national sanctioning body for bowling with more than 2,500 local associations, in 1989. He helped create Bowling Inc., an umbrella organization linking five major bowling organizations, and worked for enhanced television coverage of the sport.
        He promoted team bowling with the Brunswick World Team Challenge series, now in its fifth season, and he created the ABC Masters Series, the richest tournament on the Professional Bowlers Association Senior Tour. Mr. Dobs founded Strike Ten Entertainment, the marketing arm for bowling in the United States.
        Mr. Dobs also worked as a promoter, announcer and broadcaster for auto racing.
        His promotional activities on behalf of the bowling congress included sponsorship of a Bowling America's Sport car in the Indianapolis 500 and the creation of a Nascar League pilot program seeking to attract auto racing fans to bowling.
        Before joining the A.B.C. in 1979, Mr. Dobs was a manager for bowling lanes in Milwaukee and northern Illinois.
        Mr. Dobs, a native of Milwaukee, is survived by his wife, Marion, and three daughters, Darolyn, Deann and Danielle Hibbard.
