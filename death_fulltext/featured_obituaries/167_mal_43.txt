        Charles P. Issawi, an Egyptian-born authority on Middle East economics and history who taught at Princeton and Columbia, died Dec. 8 at a retirement community in Newtown, Pa. He was 84.
        Professor Issawi was the Bayard E. Dodge Professor of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton from 1975 to 1986, when he retired from that post. He was a professor of economics at Columbia from 1961 to 1975 and director of its Near and Middle East Institute from 1962 to 1964. After leaving Princeton, he was an adjunct professor of economics at New York University from 1987 to 1991.
        An Oxford graduate, he held Egyptian government posts in finance and banking from 1937 to 1943. He wrote an official report that became his first book, ''Egypt: An Economic and Social Analysis'' (1947), and he went on to achieve prominence as an economic historian.
        ''He was the father of the study of the modern economic history of the Middle East,'' said Roger Owen, the A. J. Meyer Professor of Middle East History at Harvard.
        Professor Issawi was a United Nations economic affairs officer in New York from 1948 to 1955 and then began teaching Middle East economics and economic history at Columbia.
        ''He decided to do it by producing books that were a combination of translations and tidbits and pieces by other people with linked passages by him,'' Professor Owen recalled. Professor Issawi produced four books of that type. The first was ''The Economic History of the Middle East, 1800-1914'' (1966).
        He also wrote influential articles for journals, especially in the 1960's. ''He was applying contemporary theories of economic development, which were very much in the air in the 50's and 60's, to a much longer look at the economic history of the Middle East countries,'' Professor Owen said. ''He used them creatively, and he was the first person to write about most of these problems in a Middle Eastern context.''
        Bernard Lewis, emeritus Cleveland E. Dodge Professor of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton, said Professor Issawi's most influential books were probably his economic histories and his books on Egypt, ''Egypt at Mid-Century'' (1954), ''Egypt in Revolution: An Economic Analysis'' (1963) and the 1947 work. Professor Issawi advocated free enterprise but was not militant on behalf of any cause or ideology.
        He was born in Cairo to Syrian parents; his father was a civil servant. He was educated at Victoria College in Alexandria, and then at Oxford, where he specialized in economics and received a bachelor's degree in 1937 and a master's degree in 1944. He taught at the American University of Beirut from 1943 to 1947.
        Professor Issawi is survived by his wife, the former Janina Maria Haftke, whom he married in 1946.
