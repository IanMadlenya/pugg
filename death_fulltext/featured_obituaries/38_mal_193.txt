        Robert A. Miller, a member of the new generation of black fashion designers, died on Wednesday at St. Vincent's Hospital after a long illness. He was 47 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Miller and his partner, Kevin Thompson, who established the company Kevin & Robert in 1976, became well-known for their leather and suede men's clothes.
        The partners won the Harvey's Bristol Cream Black Designers Award in 1980, 1981, 1982 and 1983. They were among the 12 designers showing their work in the ''Tribute to the Black Designer '80,'' at the Fashion Institute of Technology.
        ''Robert was an innovator and had a very special eye for color and fabric mix,'' Mr. Thompson said. He and Mr. Miller designed clothes for many musicians, like Stevie Wonder, Buck Williams and Luther Vandross.
        Mr. Miller was born in Birmingham, Ala. He came to New York City in 1973 and attended the Parsons School of Design.
        He is survived by his mother, Lucille, of Birmingham, and a brother, Donald, of San Antonio, Texas.
