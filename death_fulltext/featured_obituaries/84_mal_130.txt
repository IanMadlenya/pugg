        Ralph D. Hetzel Jr., a former executive vice president of the Motion Picture Association of America and a former provost at the California Institute of the Arts, died on Jan. 13 at his home in Encino, Calif. He was 81.
        He died of complications from Parkinson's disease, said a son, Otto J. Hetzel of Bethesda, Md.
        Mr. Hetzel, who was the valedictorian at Pennsylvania State University in 1933, was the son of Penn State's ninth president and was a trustee of the university for 36 years. He also did graduate work at the London School of Economics.
        From 1937 to 1942 he was the executive secretary to John L. Lewis and Philip Murray in the Congress of Industrial Organizations, a forerunner of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. During World War II, he served in the Army and was assigned to Gen. Lewis B. Hershey, the director of the Selective Service. He held senior posts at the War Production Board and the Civilian Production Administration before joining the Commerce Department after the war.
        He left the Government in 1951 to join the Motion Picture Association, the chief lobbyist for the movie studios. He served there until 1971, including the last five years as acting president.
        A painter, he was named dean of fine and professional arts at Kent State University in 1971. Five years later, he became provost at the California Institute of the Arts, a newly created college in Valencia. He retired as provost in 1976 but remained on the institute's faculty for several years.
        In addition to his son Otto, he is survived by another son, Dorn, of University Park, Pa.; two brothers, Roger, of Melvin Village, N.H., and Phillip, of Abilene, Tex.; a sister, Harriett H. Williams of Leesburg, Fla.; three grandchildren, and a great-grandson.
