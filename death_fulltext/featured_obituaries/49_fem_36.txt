        Sister Martha Christine Eber, a Lutheran deaconess, died on Tuesday at St. Clare's Hospital and Health Center in Manhattan. She was 91 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She died of pneumonia, said the Rev. Dale D. Hansen, pastor of St. Luke's Lutheran Church on West 46th Street.
        Sister Eber, who was born in Pittsburgh, was consecrated in 1924. A registered nurse, she served until 1944 as a visiting nurse at Emmanuel Lutheran Church in Manhattan, working with immigrants. She left to take care of her mother, who had suffered a stroke.
        Since 1957, Sister Eber was a deaconess at St. Luke's, helping the pastor, teaching Sunday school, visiting parish shut-ins and supervising the church office. She worked at the church until she went into the hospital two weeks ago.
        There are no immediate survivors.
