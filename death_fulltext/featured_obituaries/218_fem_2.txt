        Isabelle Goldenson, who worked for people with disabilities, including her oldest daughter, as a founder of United Cerebral Palsy, died on Feb. 21 at her home in Sarasota, Fla. She was 84.
        Her death was announced by her family.
        People with disabilities were often separated from their families and institutionalized at the time that Mrs. Goldenson and her husband, Leonard H. Goldenson, former head of ABC, were raising their daughter Genise.
        In 1945, the Goldensons and another couple, Jack and Ethel Hausman, reached out to other parents of children with cerebral palsy by placing an advertisement in The New York Herald Tribune. United Cerebral Palsy was founded in 1949.
        Mrs. Goldenson and her husband lobbied for wheelchair access to sidewalks and restrooms; donated at least $60 million to research on neurological diseases; and even recruited NASA to their cause.
        ''If we can put a man on the moon,'' she asked at a dinner party in 1971, ''why can't we develop a lightweight wheelchair for people with disabilities?'' NASA engineers soon constructed such a wheelchair as well as medical monitoring equipment.
        In 1955, Mrs. Goldenson convinced Dr. Sidney Farber of the need for research toward preventing cerebral palsy. He recruited 14 other medical scientists for what became the United Cerebral Palsy Research and Educational Foundation.
        Through its network of affiliates, United Cerebral Palsy provides daily services to more than 30,000 people.
        Isabelle Charlotte Weinstein was born in Manhattan on May 18, 1920. She attended Barnard College and Columbia University and studied at the Union Theological Seminary.
        She is survived by two daughters, Loreen Arbus of New York and Los Angeles and Maxine Goldenson of Los Angeles; and a grandson. Her daughter Genise died at the age of 29 in 1973, and her husband died in 1999.
