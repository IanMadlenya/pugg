        Bill Travilla, a Hollywood clothing designer whose dress Marilyn Monroe wore in a memorable film moment over a blustery subway grating, died Nov. 2 at Good Samaritan Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was 69 years old and lived in Los Angeles.
        Mr. Travilla died of lung cancer, said Dr. Mercedes Brenneisen, one of his physicians.
        Mr. Travilla won an Academy Award in 1949 for the costumes he designed for Errol Flynn, among others, in the film "The Adventures of Don Juan." But he once said that his favorite creation was the white dress that wafted above Miss Monroe's knees as she stood over a grate in "The Seven Year Itch." Mr. Travilla served as Miss Monroe's exclusive designer for several years.
        Mr. Travilla began his career, at age 24, as a designer at Warner Brothers and subsequently joined 20th Century Fox. He later designed clothes for several television programs, including "Dallas," and marketed costumes to the public based on his creations for the screen, most notably for the film "Valley of the Dolls."
        His clothes displayed his affinity for dramatic details, including plunging necklines and ballooning sleeves. In a 1969 report on California fashions, Bernadine Morris wrote in The New York Times, "When in doubt he turns to sequins and strews them generously over a dress inspired by a cowboy shirt or one that looks like a wall of bricks."
        Mr. Travilla is survived by a daughter, Mia, of Philadelphia, and a sister, Joan Garlow, of Walnut, Calif.
