        An obituary by The Associated Press on Thursday and its headline, about Gen. Maj. Raden Haji Harsoyo of Indonesia, incorrectly described a peacekeeping unit in which he was an officer. He was deputy commander of an Indonesian contingent in Vietnam created under the Paris peace accords of 1973; the operation was not affiliated with the United Nations.
