        Maurice Binder, a graphic arts designer known chiefly for his dazzling title sequences in the James Bond films, died on Tuesday at the University College Hospital in London. He was 73 years old and lived in London.
        He died of lung cancer, his brother, Mitchell, said.
        Mr. Binder was one of the rare film-title artists to receive rave reviews for his work, which critics said was an essential part of the James Bond success story.
        In a review of the 1981 film, "For Your Eyes Only," Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times: "And Maurice Binder's opening titles, always one of the fancier features of the Bond movies, are still terrific."
        Mr. Binder's unusual witty designs introduced other films including "Indiscreet" in 1958; "The Mouse That Roared," 1959; "The Grass is Greener," 1960; "Repulsion," 1964, and "The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes," 1971.
        He also produced several musicals, and in association with John Quested and Lester Goldsmith, produced the 1979 film "The Passage," starring Anthony Quinn.
        Born in New York City, Mr. Binder began his career as assistant art director in Macy's art department.
        A resident of London for 27 years, he was honored last year by the National Film Club.
        Besides his brother, who lives in Boca Raton, Fla., he is survived by two nieces.
