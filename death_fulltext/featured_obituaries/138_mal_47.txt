        William Mazer, who made his fortune in the paper industry and shared it with charities at home and in Israel, died on Tuesday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan.  He was 92 and lived on the Upper East Side.
        Mr. Mazer embraced the philanthropic traditions and commitments of his father, Abraham Mazer, founder of the Hudson Pulp and Paper Corporation of New York. He also served from 1953 to 1963 as president of the Muscular Dystrophy Associations of America, which was founded by his brother-in-law Paul Cohen in 1950.
        He was president and treasurer of the William and Helen Mazer Foundation, which the couple endowed in 1979. It gives primarily to higher education, social services and Jewish funds, community centers and agencies. He was a past chairman of the Greater New York Committee of the Israel Bond Organization and chairman of the pulp and paper division of the U.J.A.-Federation.
        Mr. Mazer grew up in Brooklyn, graduated from New York University in 1926 and joined the growing family business in 1927. He helped build it into one of the country's biggest producers of paper goods like tissue, towels, bags and tape.
        He served as president from 1955 to 1973 and then as chairman until 1981, two years after Hudson was sold to the Georgia-Pacific Corporation of Atlanta. He also helped establish the American-Israeli Paper Company.
        He was a past president of the America-Israel Cultural Foundation, a trustee emeritus of Brandeis University and a past president and board member of the Ackerman Institute for Family Therapy in Manhattan. He was also a supporter of Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
        His wife, Helen Cohen Mazer, died in 1990. He is survived by a daughter, Linda Berkowitz of Berkeley Heights, N.J.; two sons, Frank, of Cambridge, Mass., and Robert, of Amherst, Mass., seven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
