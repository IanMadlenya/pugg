        Clarence D. O'Connor, superintendent emeritus of the Lexington School for the Deaf in Jackson Heights, Queens, died on June 29 at New York Hospital. He was 92 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. O'Connor died of a respiratory infection, his wife said.
        Mr. O'Connor joined the Lexington School for the Deaf in 1931 as a teacher and assistant to the principal, Dr. Harris Taylor. He became superintendent when Dr. Taylor retired in 1935. Mr. O'Connor retired in 1967.
        Among his achievements were the development of the electronic Reger-O'Connor hearing aid for group training, which enabled pupils to hear their own voices as well as the voices of the other students and of the teachers, and promoting the use of closed-captioned film for the deaf.
        He was president of the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf in Washington from 1945 to 1957 and was also associated with the Council for Exceptional Children, the National Education Association and the American Instructors of the Deaf.
        Mr. O'Connor was born in Pembina, N.D., and graduated from the University of North Dakota in 1921. He moved to New York to study voice and later, for health reasons, moved to Colorado Springs, where he became interested in the education of the deaf. He studied teacher training at the Clarke School for the Deaf in Northampton, Mass., and later received a master's degree from Teachers College of Columbia University.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Helen Pumphrey, a teacher of the deaf.
