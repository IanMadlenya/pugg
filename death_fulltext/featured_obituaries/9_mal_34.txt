        Jimmy Springs, who was lead singer of the Red Caps for three decades, died Sunday. He was 75 years old.
        According to Charlie Horner, a music historian, the Red Caps set the stage for today's rhythm-and-blues groups. The group performed such songs as ''I Learned a Lesson'' and ''Blueberry Hill,'' which was popularized by the Glenn Miller orchestra in 1940, and in 1956, by Fats Domino.
        Mr. Springs was born and raised in Sycamore, Ill.. As a teen-ager he formed the Dixie Cotton Pickers, which performed Mills Brothers tunes on the radio and toured with a vaudeville show. Gene Autry put the band on his ''National Barn Dance'' radio show and toured with it.
        In the late 1930's, the group moved to California and appeared in several films. In ''Double or Nothing,'' which starred Bing Crosby, the band performed as a ''human orchestra,'' imitating trumpets, trombones and bass fiddles. After moving to New York, the band changed its name and began performing in nightclubs.
