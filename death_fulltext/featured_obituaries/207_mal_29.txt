        Sakip Sabanci, a leading philanthropist in Turkey and one of its most prominent businessmen as head of the conglomerate Sabanci Holding, died here on Saturday. He was 71.
        The cause was kidney cancer that had spread to his liver, according to doctors at the American Hospital, where he was being treated.
        Mr. Sabanci's family was listed as the world's 147th richest by Forbes this year, with assets worth $3.2 billion. He turned a small family business into an empire with more than 30,000 employees.
        He also started a foundation that runs more than 100 health, education and culture centers throughout Turkey.
        Under his leadership, Sabanci Holding became partners with global companies like Toyota, Philip Morris and I.B.M.
        He had also been chairman of the Turkish Industrialists' and Businessmen's Association.
        He had an international reputation in arts circles because of his Ottoman calligraphy collection, which toured Europe and was exhibited in the Louvre in Paris and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
        Mr. Sabanci's funeral Monday became a state occasion, with representatives of the Turkish military, political leaders and artists in attendance. His philanthropy and the unique version of the Anatolian accent that he used in public appearances earned him the nickname Sakip Agha, a title of respect in Turkish.
        He is survived by his wife, Turkan, a son and two daughters.
