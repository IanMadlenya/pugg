        Louis Marshall Jones, a mainstay of the Grand Ole Opry and country music since he transformed himself at age 22 into the corn-pone, banjo-pickin' Grandpa Jones who later gained ''Hee Haw'' fame, died on  Thursday at McKendree Village in Nashville. He was 84 and lived in  Goodlettsville, Tenn.
        Mr. Jones and his wife, Ramona, whose voice and fiddle formed an important part of the family act, were recognized by the Smithsonian Institution in its performing arts series in 1982.
        In return, they performed for about two hours at the Baird Auditorium in Washington, starting with his usual twangy opener, ''Mountain Dew,'' and closing with his signoff, ''Are You From Dixie?''
        In between, he clawed his banjo, jumped up and down, stamped the floor, yodeled, yelped and told one-liners and earthy stories.
        At the end he gave the Smithsonian a set of the baggy pants, loud suspenders, high-topped boots and crumpled hat that had been his trademark for as long as his jokes.
        ''My voice ain't that great,'' he said, ''so I stomp my feet a lot to get the audience's attention.''
        Nevertheless, at least to the Smithsonian, he was ''one of the premier interpreters of early country, folk and gospel music.''
        He was born in Niagra, Ky., the youngest of 10 children, and learned to play fiddle, mandolin and guitar as a child.
        He performed in Wheeling, W.Va., and Cincinnati, made his first appearance with the Grand Ole Opry in 1946, and joined the show for good in 1959.
        The ''Hee Haw'' variety show featured him from 1968 to 1993. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1978.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a son, Mark A., of Omaha, Ark.; two daughters, Eloise Jones Hawkins of Hendersonville, Tenn., and Alisa J. Wall of Goodlettsville; a brother, Eugene W., of Hendersonville, and four grandchildren.
