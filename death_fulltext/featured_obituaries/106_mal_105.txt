        The Rev. Dr. Raphael Philemon Powell, who began his career as a polemicist inspired by the Marcus Garvey black nationalist movement and ended it as a Baptist minister preaching many of the same themes, died on Nov. 12 at his apartment in Harlem. He was 96 and had been assistant to the pastor of the Mount Calvary Baptist Church since 1986.
        Dr. Powell arrived in Boston from Jamaica on a cargo ship as a teen-ager and  attended classes while washing dishes and holding other menial jobs. He studied  at a series of Boston colleges during the 1920's, including Northeastern and Suffolk Law School, and even took correspondence courses, but it was not until he was 61 that he received a college degree, a bachelor of science in religion from the Columbia University School of General Studies in New York. He later received a doctor of divinity from the Manhattan Bible College.
        Beginning in the 1930's, Dr. Powell wrote more than 15 books, supplementing  his income from a series of bureaucratic jobs in New York by publishing them himself, peddling them to stores and operating a mail-order business from his Harlem apartment.
        His most noted work, "Prayer for Freedom," written in connection with a 1957  prayer meeting in Washington, is included in James Melvin Washington's "Conversations with God," a collection of prayers written by African-Americans dating back to the 1700's.
