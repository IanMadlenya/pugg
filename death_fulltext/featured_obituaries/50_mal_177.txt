        Gerald Cramer, a Swiss art dealer and publisher, died on Sunday at his home in Mies, a suburb of Geneva. He was 74 years old and also had a residence in Manhattan.
        He died of cancer, his wife, Ynes, said.
        From 1942 to 1983, Mr. Cramer ran the Galerie Gerald Cramer in Geneva, where he published illustrated books and print editions by artists like Braque, Miro, Chagall, Henry Moore and Max Ernst. He also published trade books.
        His best-known limited edition publication was Miro's "A Toute Epreuve," 1948, a suite of etchings by the artist with text by Paul Eluard, considered by connoisseurs one of the most beautiful books in 20th-century art.
        The Miro book and two limited edition suites of etchings, Chagall's "Psalms of David," 1979, and Moore's "Elephant Skull," 1970, have been exhibited in separate shows at the Museum of Modern Art.
        From 1973 to 1980, Mr. Cramer published a catalogue raisonne of Henry Moore's graphic work in several volumes.
        Born in Geneva, Mr. Cramer studied law at the Universities of Geneva and Munich. While serving in the Swiss Army during World War II, he decided to switch from law to art book publishing, following in the footsteps of his ancestors, proprietors of Cramer & Brothers, Voltaire's publishers.
        Besides his wife, Mr. Cramer is survived by a son, Patrick, who now runs the gallery; a daughter, Tania Grand d'Hauteville, and two grandchildren, all of Geneva.
