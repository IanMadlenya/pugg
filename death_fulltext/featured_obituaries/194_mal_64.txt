        Alan Howard, a lead dancer with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo and a ballet teacher, died on March 6 in Chicago. He was 72.
        The cause was cancer, said his niece, Pat Bostwick of Chicago, his only immediate survivor.
        Mr. Howard, who was born in Chicago, trained with Edna McRae and joined the Ballet Russe in 1949. He rose to the rank of premier danseur in the company, which he left in 1960. Mr. Howard also danced with the Mia Slavenska Ballet and New York City Ballet and at Radio City Music Hall.
        He founded the Pacific Ballet Academy in San Francisco, which produced the Pacific Ballet, and choreographed several pieces for that company. He was a popular guest teacher at many companies and institutions.
        His students included Kyra Nichols, a principal dancer with the City Ballet.
