        Msgr. Walter J. Vetro, founder and chairman of the St. Nicholas Neighborhood Preservation Corporation in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, died on Monday in the rectory of St. Nicholas Roman Catholic Church, where he lived. He was 73 years old.
        He apparently died of a heart attack, a parish spokesman said.
        Monsignor Vetro was pastor of St. Nicholas from 1970 until he retired in 1987. In 1975 he founded the preservation group to deal with the severe problem of housing decay in Willismsburg, and he served as its chairman until his death.
        Earlier, he held parish posts in Brooklyn and served as principal of Christ the King High School in Middle Village, Queens, and Bishop McDonnell High School in Brooklyn.
        He is survived by a brother, Edwin, of Bayside, Queens.
