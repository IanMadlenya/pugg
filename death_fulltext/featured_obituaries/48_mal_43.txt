        T. Murray McDonnell, chairman of McDonnell & Company from 1951 until the Wall Street brokerage house went out of business in 1970, died on Tuesday at his home in Peapack, N.J. He was 68 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. McDonnell spent his entire career with the brokerage house, which was founded in 1903 by his father, James. His mother, the former Anna Murray, was a daughter of Thomas E. Murray, the inventor and the holder of many electrical patents.
        Murray McDonnell, a native New Yorker and a graduate of Georgetown University, joined the family businesafter serving as a first lieutenant in the Army in France in World War II and receiving two Bronze Stars.
        He became chairman of McDonnell in 1951. In 1970, the company succumbed to insufficient capital and the fortunes of a sagging stock market.
        The Securities and Exchange Commission subsequently said Mr. McDonnell had failed to adequately supervise the company, which had violated rules on capital requirements, mingling of funds and bookkeeping. He was barred from taking a managerial position as a securities dealer, but in 1973 he was able to join Allen & Company, where he served until his death as a vice president handling foreign business.
        Mr. McDonnell is survived by his wife, the former Marjorie Flanigan; four daughters, Pia Pearce of Quechee, Vt., Megan Kyle of Freeport, Me., Peggy Vance of Seattle and Anna Harper of Santa Monica, Calif.; four sons, Michael, of Santa Monica, Stephen of Manhattan, Terence, of Greenwich, Conn., and Andrew of Peapack, and 12 grandchildren.
