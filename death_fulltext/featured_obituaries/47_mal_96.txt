        Ralph Gomez, the founding director of the Inner-City Ensemble Theater and Dance Company of Paterson, N.J., a widely acclaimed training program for urban teen-agers, died on Friday at New York University Hospital in Manhattan. He was 40 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of AIDS, his companion, James Brega, said yesterday.
        Mr. Gomez established the ensemble in 1973. The ensemble members worked to improve their self-confidence and self-expression as well as their professional skills. Many went on to attend the Juilliard School and major universities, and to perform with the Alvin Ailey and Jose Limon dance troupes and with Ballet Hispanico.
        Mr. Gomez left the Inner-City Ensemble in 1986 to found and direct youth programs for the Hub in the South Bronx and Project Street Beat, also in the South Bronx, which seeks to combat AIDS among drug users and prostitutes.
        Mr. Gomez was born in Newark and grew up in Lakewood, N.J. He received a bachelor's degree in theater from William Paterson College and a master's degree in social work from Rutgers University.
        He is survived by his mother, Madeline, and a brother, Richard, both of Palm Coast, Fla.
