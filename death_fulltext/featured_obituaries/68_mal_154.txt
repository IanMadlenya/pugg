        Bernard E. Alpern, a former corporate executive, builder and philanthropist in New York, died on Friday in Palm Beach, Fla., where he was living in retirement. He was 90 years old.
        His family said he died of prostate cancer after a long illness.
        An architecture graduate of Cooper Union, he was the former chairman of Grand Iron Works in the Bronx. The company, founded in 1904 by his father, Emil, a Russian immigrant, remained in operation until eight years ago.
        The company, in Hunts Point, supplied steel for some large projects, including the former Pan Am Building, the World Trade Center and Belmont Racetrack. Mr. Alpern branched out into real-estate development in the 1950's and built apartment houses in Riverdale and Yonkers.
        He was a past president of the Bronx Board of Trade and treasurer of the Bronx County Democratic organization. His charitable interests included the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, the Children's Cerebral Palsy Foundation, the Hebrew Home for the Chronic Sick in the Bronx, the Chemotherapy Foundation and St. Mary's Hospital in West Palm Beach, Fla.
        Mr. Alpern is survived by his son, Lloyd, a resident of Manhattan and Puerto Rico.
