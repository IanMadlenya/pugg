        Lee Schaenen, a conductor who directed the Lyric Opera of Chicago Center for American Artists from 1974 to 1991, died on Thursday at his home in Sanibel, Fla. He was 67 years old.
        Danny Newman, the public relations director of the Lyric Opera, said the cause of death was cancer.
        Mr. Schaenen was born in New York on Aug. 10, 1925, and studied the piano, French horn and conducting at the High School of Music and Art, the Manhattan School of Music and the Juilliard School. He made his professional debut with the New York City Opera in 1949. In 1951 he organized Opera Futures, a student workshop that specialized in rarely heard works.
        Mr. Schaenen began conducting in Europe in 1953, mostly with German and Italian opera companies and in radio concerts. For several years, beginning in 1955, he worked with Herbert von Karajan, and in the late 1950's, he was permanent conductor of the Vienna Volksoper.
        In the United States, Mr. Schaenen conducted at the Seattle Opera, the Columbus Opera and the Florentine Opera of Milwaukee. But his closest American association was with the Lyric Opera of Chicago, where he made his debut in 1958. As head of the company's Center for American Artists, he conducted the world premieres of "The Guilt of Lillian Sloan," by William Neil, and "The Fan," by Lee Goldstein.
        He is survived by his wife, Nell Schaenen.
