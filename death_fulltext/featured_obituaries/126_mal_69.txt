        Dr. Thomas H. Meikle Jr., a former dean of the Cornell University Medical College and retired president of the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation, both in New York, died yesterday at his home in Roxbury, Conn. He was 68.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        During his career, which began at Cornell in 1961, Dr. Meikle helped reshape the way doctors and other health professionals are trained, in a shift from large lectures to small-group teaching.
        He served Cornell for 26 years in a variety of administrative posts, including eight years as dean, and was then president for nine years at the Macy foundation, from which he retired last year.
        Dr. Meikle was a native of Troy, Pa., and studied at Cornell, earning an undergraduate degree in 1951 and a medical degree three years later. His first marriage ended in divorce.
        He is survived by his wife, Dr. Jacqueline Winterkorn; a son and daughter from his first marriage: David A. and Sarah, both of New York, and two other daughters, Elisabeth Winterkorn and Margaret Meikle.
        Correction:  July 24, 1997, Thursday
        An obituary on Monday, and in late editions on Sunday, about Dr. Thomas H. Meikle Jr., a medical educator, misstated the surname of a surviving daughter. She is Margaret Winterkorn-Meikle, not Meikle.
