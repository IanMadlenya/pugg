        Edouard Roditi, a poet, essayist and translator associated with the Surrealists in the 1930's, died on May 10 at his home in Paris. He was 81 years old.
        He died from injuries suffered in an accident in Spain, where he was vacationing, said Garrett White, his literary executor.
        Born in Paris of American parents, Mr. Roditi spoke seven languages and wrote both prose and poetry with equal ease in several of them.
        "At the age of 10," he wrote in the introduction to one of his volumes of poetry, "I was given English poems to translate into Latin verse and, at the age of 12, into Greek verse, too. I thus remember translating Byron's 'Sennacherib' into Virgilian hexameters, and Gray's 'Elegy' into Ovidian couplets."
        Mr. Roditi was the first to translate works by Andre Breton, the founder of the French Surrealist movement, into English, Mr. White said.
        After World War II, Mr. Roditi served as a translator at the Nuremberg war crimes trials. His publications include several volumes of poetry and "Dialogues of Art," a collection of interviews with artists. The poet Richard Eberhart praised his poetry for its "sardonic wit and brittle realizations."
        He is survived by a brother, James, of St. Albans, England.
        Correction:  May 23, 1992, Saturday
        An obituary on May 23 about Edouard Roditi, a poet and transla tor, misstated the place of his death.  He died at a friend's home in Spain, not in Paris. In July, Mr. Roditi's brother wrote to The Times about the error. His letter went astray and he has now written again.
