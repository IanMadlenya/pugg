        David Wright, an acclaimed South African-born poet, died on Aug. 28 at his stepdaughter's home in Waldron, East Sussex, England. He was 74 and had homes in Cumbria in northern England and in Portugal.
        The cause was cancer, The Times of London reported.
        Another British newspaper, The Daily Telegraph, summing up Mr. Wright's career last week, called him profuse, fluent, versatile and "the foremost South African poet of his generation."
        His poetry was by turns lyrical, satirical and narrative. Sometimes it was fueled by recollections of his homeland, although he was not politically active on South African issues. After Nelson Mandela became South Africa's first black president, Mr. Wright wrote to a friend, "I wish the Irish could be so forgiving as the blacks."
        His books included "Poems" (1949), "Moral Stories" (1954) and "Poems and Versions" (1993). Mr. Wright became deaf in childhood, and a fellow poet, Geoffrey Hill, wrote of him in 1980, "It is a creative paradox that we owe to a deaf man some of the most striking images of sound in contemporary English poetry."
        Mr. Wright also wrote many kinds of prose.
        He was born in Johannesburg, became deaf through scarlet fever when he was 7, went to a school for the deaf in Northampton, England, and studied at Oxford.
        In 1951 he married Philippa Reid, who died in 1985.
        He is survived by his second wife, the former Oonagh Swift, whom he married in 1987.
