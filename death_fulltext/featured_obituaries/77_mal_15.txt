        Harry Levin, former dean of the Cornell University College of Arts and Sciences, died on Sunday at Tompkins Community Hospital in Ithaca, N.Y. He was 68 and lived in Ithaca.
        His wife, Deborah, said the cause was heart failure.
        Professor Levin was a researcher known for his studies of the psychology of reading. He was the William R. Kenan Jr. Professor Emeritus of Psychology and had been a member of the Cornell faculty since 1955. He was dean of the College of Arts and Sciences from 1974 to 1978 and chairman of the psychology department from 1966 to 1973.
        In the late 1960's, he was the director of a federally financed research project at Cornell called Project Literacy. The purpose of the study was to examine the relationship between reading and learning.  Studying Speech Styles
        The project was completed in 1968 and recommended a nationwide revision in curriculums for teaching reading to adults and children. The findings were summarized in "The Psychology of Reading" (M.I.T. Press, 1974), written with Professor Levin's collaborator in the studies, Eleanor J. Gibson, a Cornell psychologist.
        His later work focused on the social psychology of language. The studies showed how people adjusted their style of speech in different social contexts.
        He was born in Baltimore. He served in the Army from 1944 to 1946 and earned a B.A. from the University of Maryland in 1948. He received an M.A. in 1949 and a Ph.D. in 1951, both from the University of Michigan.
        Before he retired from Cornell in 1990, he was a visiting professor of psychology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1973 and at Harvard University from 1978 to 1979.
        Besides his wife of 47 years, the former Deborah Stern, he is survived by two daughters, Lynn Lederer of Madison, Wis., and Rebecca, of Baltimore; a son, David, of Evanston, Ill., and three granddaughters.
