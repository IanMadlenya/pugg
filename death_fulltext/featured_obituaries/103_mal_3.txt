        Laurindo Almeida, a Brazilian guitarist who helped introduce Brazilian music in the United States and recorded with the Modern Jazz Quartet, Herbie Mann and Stan Kenton, died on Wednesday at the Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys, Calif. He was 77.
        The cause was leukemia, said his wife, Deltra.
        Mr. Almeida began his career as a classical guitar virtuoso in Sao Paulo. But he had absorbed Brazilian popular music as well, and he became a staff guitarist on Brazilian radio as well as a regular performer in nightclubs.
        In 1947 he moved to Los Angeles permanently. He joined Stan Kenton's orchestra, where he met many of the people with whom he subsequently recorded. And he jumped into the radio and movie-music recording scene in Los Angeles.
        In 1953 Mr. Almeida led an important recording session with the saxophonist Bud Shank that mixed the sound of Brazilian popular music with jazz improvisation. At the time, the album, now called "Brazilliance Vol. 1" (World Pacific), was well received and considered a bit experimental. Its cross-stylistic impulse was taken up by Stan Getz, who furthered the popularity of bossa nova in the United States.
        In the 1960's, Mr. Almeida maintained a busy recording schedule. He released "Collaboration" (Atlantic) in 1964 with the Modern Jazz Quartet. He continued to record and perform classical music, and spent a good portion of the latter part of his career recording for Concord Records, a California company for whom he made nearly 20 albums.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Laurindiniho; two brothers, Edgar and Geraldo, and a sister, Gezina, all of Rio de Janeiro.
