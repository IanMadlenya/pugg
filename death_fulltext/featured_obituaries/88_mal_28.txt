        Stefan H. Baum, a retired president of Reichhold Chemicals in White Plains, died on Monday at the 3030 Park Avenue Nursing Home in Bridgeport, Conn. Mr. Baum, who had lived in Greenwich, was 91.
        The cause was a stroke, said his son, Axel H. Baum.
        Mr. Baum moved to the United States from Germany in 1932 and worked for Reichhold, an international manufacturer of adhesives and polymers, for 40 years, retiring in 1973. He received an engineering degree from the Technical Institute of Berlin and a doctorate in economics from the University of Berlin.
        He is survived by his son, who lives in Paris.
