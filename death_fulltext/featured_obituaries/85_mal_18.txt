        Baron Alessandro Rubin de Cervin Albrizzi, a photographer and writer who chronicled the gardens of Venice, Florence and New York, died on Thursday in Venice. He was 59 and lived in Venice.
        The cause of death was cancer, said his companion, Hiram Williams.
        Baron Albrizzi was the photographer of "The Gardens of Venice," written by Mary Jane Pool (Rizzoli International Publications, 1989) and of "The Gardens of Florence," also with Miss Pool (Rizzoli, 1992).
        At his death, he and Miss Pool were working on "The Gardens of New York," for which he had already photographed 20 to 30 gardens.
        Baron Albrizzi began his career as a photographer and writer in Paris, contributing to Connaissance des Arts, L'Oeil, Realites and House and Garden. In 1965, he founded Albrizzi Ltd., a design firm with offices in London, New York and other cities.
        Besides Mr. Williams, Baron Albrizzi is survived by a son, Lorenzo, of Venice; a sister, Alba, of Milan and a brother, Ernesto, of Venice.
