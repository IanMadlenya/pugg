        Maurice Mayer Cohen, a retailer who was a supporter of Brandeis University and other educational and cultural institutions, died on Thursday at his home in Newton, Mass. He was 80.
        Mr. Cohen, who also had a home in Palm Beach, Fla., suffered a long illness, his family said.
        In 1945 he and his brothers established Lechmere Sales, a discount store in Cambridge, Mass., that grew into a chain, operating mostly in Massachusetts. It is now a subsidiary of the Dayton Hudson Corporation of Minneapolis.
        Mr. Cohen and his wife, Marilyn Cobrain Cohen, established the Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies at Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass., a research center for Jewish institutions throughout North America. He became a Brandeis trustee in 1975, a post he held until his death.
        Mr. Cohen, who was born in Boston and attended Boston University, served on numerous boards, including the National Foundation for Jewish Culture. He also was a founder of the Jewish Historical Museum in Amsterdam.
        Besides his wife, Mr. Cohen is survived by a son, Lewis C., of Brookline, Mass.; a daughter, Betsy C. Solomon of Chestnut Hill, Mass.; two brothers, Phillip, of Newton, and Norman D., of New York City, and five grandchildren.
