        Dr. Hollis Steadman Ingraham, New York State Commissioner of Health under Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, died on Tuesday in Albany Medical Center Hospital. He was 86 and lived in Slingerlands, N.Y.
        He suffered a brief illness, his family said.
        Dr. Ingraham devoted his career to public health. He was born in Brookline, Mass., and graduated from Harvard College in 1930. He received his medical degree cum laude at Harvard Medical School and also graduated from the Harvard School of Public Health.
        He began to work for the health department in Albany in 1934 as an epidemiologist trainee and by 1948 was a deputy commissioner.
        He served as a commander in the Navy in World War II. Returning to the state health department, he also taught epidemiology and public health at several medical schools.
        Governor Rockefeller appointed him Commissioner of Health in 1963, and during his tenure he oversaw the arrival of Medicaid and expansion of hospitals and nursing homes in the state, a transition that was controversial and much criticized.
        He left the State Government in 1974 at the end of the Rockefeller era, but worked as a public-health physician for the Albany County Health Department until recently, when his health failed.
        Dr. Ingraham is survived by his wife of 63 years, Helena Johnson Ingraham; two daughters, Sylvia Goetzmann and Priscilla Pultz, both of Skaneateles, N.Y.; two sons, Mark of Pennington, N.J., and Irad of New Berlin, N.Y.; a brother, William, and sister, Fern Bonet, both of Margaree, Nova Scotia; 15 grandchildren, and 18 great-grandchildren.
