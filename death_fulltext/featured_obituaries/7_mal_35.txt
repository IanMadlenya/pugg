        Born in Taranto in 1897, Mr. Pane studied at the University of Rome and, for many years, was on the faculty of Naples University. He became one of the foremost scholars of Neapolitan and southern Italian culture, writing many books and monographs on the monuments and other buildings of the region.
        His two-volume study of Renaissance art and architecture of the area, ''Il Rinascimento nell'Italia Meridionale,'' is considered his most important work. Since 1961, he had also directed ''Napoli Nobilissima,'' a scholarly journal founded by Mr. Pane's friend, Benedetto Croce, the philospher. His research interests also included Spanish and Central American architecture and 19th-century French literature.
        Mr. Pane is survived by his wife, Eugenia, their son, Giulio, and two grandchildren.
