        August A. Luebs, a former professor at the University of Nebraska who was an expert on air-conditioning, died in Lincoln on Friday. He was 100 years old and lived in Lincoln.
        Mr. Luebs retired in 1958 after a 40-year teaching career in the university's mechanical engineering department.
        In the 1930's he perfected a method of measuring fuel requirements in air-conditioning called a ''degree-day,'' which represents one degree of variation from a standard average daily temperature. He also established ratings for oil-heating and gas-heating equipment.
        He is survived by a son, John, of Syracuse; a brother, two sisters, six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
