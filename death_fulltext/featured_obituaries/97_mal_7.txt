        Lon Chaney, a leading tap-dancer who performed in the musical revue "Black and Blue" and with the Original Hoofers, died yesterday at Bronx Municipal Hospital Center. He was 68 and lived in the Bronx.
        The cause was injuries from an automobile accident in December, said his sister, Evelyn Peterson.
        Mr. Chaney was built like a barrel and moved with the deliberation of the boxer he once was, but his dancing had a surprising lightness and clarity. He has been credited with the development of jazz steps called the Paddle and Roll.
        Mr. Chaney, whose original name was Isaiah Chaneyfield, began to dance after he moved to New York City from South Carolina, where he was born. In the time-honored tradition of tap dance, he "just learned in the street," his sister said. "He saw someone dancing, loved it and asked how to do it." He shortened his last name and renamed himself Lon, not after the Hollywood Chaneys, but because he and his wife liked the name.
        Mr. Chaney began to perform in the 1960's and danced in the 70's with the Original Hoofers, a group of tappers that at one time or another included Chuck Green, Jimmy Slyde, Ralph Brown, Baby Laurence and Raymond Kaalund. Mr. Chaney appeared in both the Paris and Broadway productions of "Black and Blue" and danced on television and in theaters and jazz clubs throughout New York.
        Mr. Chaney's wife died in 1993. He is survived, in addition to his sister, of the Bronx, by a son, Lon Jr., of Phoenix.
