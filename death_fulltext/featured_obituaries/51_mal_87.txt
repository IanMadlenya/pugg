        Norris M. Shimabuku, an actor and member of the Pan Asian Repertory Theater, died in his sleep on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 44 years old.
        The cause of death is to be determined after an autopsy, according to Russell Murphy, a business associate of the theater.
        Mr. Shimabuku starred in many Pan Asian Repertory productions since moving to New York in 1985, among them "The Imposter," "Lucky Come Hawaii," "Shogun Macbeth" and "The Man Who Turned Into a Stick."
        Mr. Shimabuku was born in Honolulu and studied acting at the University of Hawaii. He recently appeared in the New York Shakespeare Festival's production of "Henry IV, Parts 1 and 2."
        He is survived by his mother, Irma, of Honolulu, two sisters and a brother.
