        Melvin C. Holm, who led the Carrier Corporation for nearly two decades, died on Wednesday at his home in Manlius, N.Y. He was 74 years old.
        In 1965 Mr. Holm was elected president of Carrier, the world's largest maker of heating, refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment. He became chief executive officer in February 1968 and chairman eight months later.
        In his tenure as the head of Carrier, the company built two 19-story towers, now the MONY towers, in downtown Syracuse and contributed $2.75 million to build the $28 million athletic dome at Syracuse University, which named it for Carrier.
        Mr. Holm was born Nov. 9, 1916, in Iron River, Mich. He studied at Michigan State University from 1934 to 1935, then hitchhiked east with a friend to find a job. In April 1937 he took a job as a bookkeeper with a company in Newark that he had never heard of, the Carrier Corporation.  Retired in 1982
        Carrier moved to Syracuse a few months later and Mr. Holm began his advance. He was named comptroller in 1950, was elected a vice president in 1955 and two years later was named treasurer and chief financial officer.
        In 1979 Carrier was taken over by United Technologies Corporation of Hartford, despite Carrier's resistance. Mr. Holm retired in January 1982.
        He served on the boards of Syracuse University, Mutual of New York and several banks. He was active in the National Association of Manufacturers.
        He is survived by his wife, Barbara; a daughter, Joyce Calver of Fayetteville, N.Y.; a son, Melvin, of Manlius, and five grandchildren.
