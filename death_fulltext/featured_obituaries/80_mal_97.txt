        Alvin Hasenberg, an executive in the confectionary industry, died on Sept. 16 at the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, N.J. He was 76.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        In 1956 Mr. Hasenberg joined the Chunky Corporation, and after Chunky's merger with the Ward Food Company he became executive vice president.
        For the last eight years he worked with the National Confectionary Sales Association as its director of publications and executive secretary of its New York branch.
        He lived in Metuchen, N.J., for 35 years, where he did volunteer work for the Friends of the Metuchen Public Library.
        He is survived by his wife, Estelle; a son, Steven, of Pacific Palisades, Calif.; a daughter, Diana Hastings of Manhattan; a sister, Mildred Matlin of Howell, N.J., and a grandchild.
        Correction:  September 27, 1993, Monday
        An obituary on Saturday about Alvin Hasenberg, an executive in the confectionary industry, misstated his age and the date of his death. He died on Sept. 13, not on Sept. 16, and he was 70, not 76.
