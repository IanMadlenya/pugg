        Victor Laurence August Christgau, a former Republican United States Representative from Minnesota who became executive director of the Social Security Administration, died on Thursday at George Washington University Hospital in Washington. He was 97 years old and lived in Washington.
        Mr. Christgau died of pneumonia, the hospital said.
        A Minnesota farmer, and a graduate of the University of Minnesota and its College of Agriculture, Mr. Christgau served in the Minnesota Senate until he was elected to the United States House in 1929. He served until 1933 and then became an assistant administrator in the Agricultural Adjustment Administration in Washington.
        From 1935 to 1938, he was Works Project Administrator for Minnesota, and then served for 16 years as director of the Minnesota Division of Employment and Security. He returned to Washington to become director of the Bureau of Old Age and Survivors Insurance. No Immediate Survivors
        During his early years at the bureau, electronic data processing equipment was installed to keep track of the swelling accounts of millions of Americans who paid part of their earnings into the Social Security System's trust fund. His position as director was likened to being the world's biggest bookkeeper, and Mr. Christgau liked to say his accounts included 149 "customers" named Davy Crockett and 221 named Daniel Boone.
        He became executive director of the Social Security Administration in 1963 and served until 1965.
        He leaves no immediate survivors. His wife, Muriel Christgau, died in 1987.
