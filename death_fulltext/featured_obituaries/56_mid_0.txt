        Kathryn Bereano Newman, a lawyer and one of the first administrative judges in the New York City Parking Violations Bureau, died on Wednesday at Beth Israel Hospital. She was 83 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mrs. Newman was a 1929 graduate of New York University Law School. She graduated first in her class. Second was Bernard Newman, now a Federal judge, and her husband for 59 years.
        "We had a sadistic professor who disliked women students," he recalled yesterday. "When he grilled her for an hour on the first day of class and she stood up to him, I resolved to marry her then and there." He did, seven years later.
        Mrs. Newman and her husband practiced law in Manhattan as Newman & Newman from 1930 to 1962, when he received an interim appointment to the State Supreme Court. When he was named to Family Court in 1965, Mrs. Newman continued in private practice alone.
        Mrs. Newman was appointed to the Parking Violations Bureau when it opened, in 1970. She was a member of local School Board No. 4 from 1940 to 1965, and, until her death, a member of the Board of Governors of the New York University Law Review Alumni.
        Besides her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Phyllis Cechini and Helene Bernstein, both of Manhattan; a brother, Leon Berano; a sister, Beatrice Bereano; eight grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
