        Kaj Aage Strand, an astronomer and former scientific director of the United States Naval Observatory, died on Tuesday in Washington. He was 93.
        In 1958, Dr. Strand joined the observatory, the nation's time-keeper and celestial observer since 1830, as head of its astronomy and astrophysics division. He was scientific director from 1963 until his retirement in 1977. After that, he was a consultant to government agencies and universities.
        A specialist in positional astronomy, he did pioneering work in determining stellar distances with reflecting telescopes. Among his principal interests were double stars and their motions.
        He guided the design and construction of the Navy's 61-inch telescope in Flagstaff, Ariz., an important tool for stellar distance measurements. In use since 1964, the telescope has since become known as the Strand Astronomic Telescope.
        A native of Hellerup, Denmark, Kaj Aage Gunnar Strand became interested in double stars while studying at the universities of Copenhagen and Leiden. He received his Ph.D. in Copenhagen in 1938, the year he came to the United States as a research fellow in astronomy at Swarthmore College.
        He started a photographic double-star program at Swarthmore before entering the Army as a private in 1942. He rose to major, test-flying B-29 bombers and training air crews for special missions like the atomic bomb attacks on Japan.
        He returned briefly to Swarthmore after the war and also worked at the University of Chicago and Northwestern University before joining the staff of the Naval Observatory. He was a member of the American Academy for the Advancement of Science and won honors from professional and academic societies on both sides of the Atlantic.
        Dr. Strand's survivors include his wife of 51 years, Emilie Rashevsky Strand; and two daughters, Kristina Ragna Strand, of Marshal, N.C., and Dr. Vibeke Strand, of Portola Valley, Calif.
