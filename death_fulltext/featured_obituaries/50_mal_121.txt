        Etheridge Knight, who began writing poetry in prison and emerged to win acclaim and awards for his work, died on Sunday at his home in Indianpolis. He was 57 years old.
        He died of lung cancer, his sister, Clyneese Knight-Bennett, said.
        Mr. Knight's works were part of a flood of poetry resonating throughout the nation's black communities in the late 1960's and early 70's. He received a fellowship from the Guggenheim Foundation in 1974, and held writer-in-residence positions at several universities, including the University of Pittsburgh and Wesleyan University.
        Mr. Knight published four books: "Poems from Prison" ( 1968), "Black Voices from Prison" (1970), "Belly Song and Other Poems" (1973) and "Born of a Woman: New and Selected Poems" (1980).
        Mr. Knight received a 10-to-25-year indeterminate sentence in 1960 for committing robbery. He served nearly eight years in Indiana State Prison in Michigan City.
        He once said: "I died in Korea from a shrapnel wound and narcotics resurrected me. I died in 1960 from a prison sentence and poetry brought me back to life."
        Mr. Knight was a medical technician in the Army, serving in Guam, Hawaii and Korea.
        Mr. Knight's marriages to Sonia Sanchez and Mary McAnally ended in divorce.
        In addition to Ms. Knight-Bennett, he is survived by a daughter, Mary Tandewa-McAnnally-Knight; his mother, Belzora Knight-Taylor; two other sisters, Eunice Knight-Bowens and Janice Knight-Davis; a brother, Floyd Knight Sr., all of Indianapolis.
