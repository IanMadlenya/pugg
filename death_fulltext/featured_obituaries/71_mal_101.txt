        Paul M. Sachner, the executive editor of Architectural Record, died yesterday at John Dempsey Hospital in Farmington, Conn. He was 42 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of AIDS, his family said.
        Mr. Sachner joined the Record, a national monthly professional journal, in 1984 and became executive editor in 1989. He was the steward of its annual awards for housing design and championed lesser-known American architects. He also started an awards program, In the Public Interest, to honor innovative civic architecture.
        Earlier, he was an program analyst for the New York State Council on the Arts and a preservation specialist for the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission.
        Mr. Sachner was born in Bristol, Conn. After graduating from Trinity College in Hartford, he earned a master's degree in architectural history from Columbia University.
        Surviving are his mother, Ruth, of Boynton Beach, Fla.; a sister, Sarah Elsden of New Britain, Conn., and a brother, Marc, of Milwaukee.
