        Proctor Patterson Jones, an author, photographer, publisher and lawyer who was a presence in San Francisco for over four decades, died there on April 2 at his home in the Pacific Heights section of the city. He was 83.
        Mr. Jones began his career writing legal texts. But he turned professional photographer, filmmaker and author and in 1970 founded the Proctor Jones Publishing Company. He was still its president at his death.
        The company's booklist reflected Mr. Jones's curiosity about French and Napoleonic history, on which he wrote extensively. He also published photographic books and mystery novels and made his own contributions to both genres.
        Proctor Jones, a native of Cleveland, graduated from Western Reserve University in 1937 and studied law at Harvard and Stanford Universities before serving in the military in North Africa and Italy in World War II.
        He received a law degree at Western Reserve, now Case Western, in 1948. That year he returned to Stanford to study political science, from which grew four decades of public service on many governmental boards in the San Francisco Bay area.
        His books about Napoleon included English editions of the memoirs of Baron Fain, a cabinet official (1998), and of Louis Joseph Marchand, the Emperor's valet and friend (1998). He was a contributor to ''Napoleon: An Intimate Account of the Years of Supremacy, 1800-1914'' (Random House, 1992), which earned the 1992 Literary Award of the Napoleonic Society.
        He and his wife supported San Francisco's museums, symphony and opera, as well as several historic sites in France.
        Mr. Jones is survived by his wife of 52 years, Martha Martin Jones; two sons, John B., of Los Angeles, and Proctor Jr., of San Francisco; three daughters, Melinda Windisch of Greensboro, N.C., Greta Jones of Raleigh, N.C., and Martha Griffinger of Piedmont, Calif.; 10 grandchildren, and 3 great-grandchildren.
