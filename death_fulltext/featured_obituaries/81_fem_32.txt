        Mary C. Lawton, the Justice Department official in charge of foreign intelligence surveillance, died on Monday at her home in Bethesda, Md. She was 58.
        A department official said the cause was a pulmonary embolism.
        As counsel for intelligence policy and head of the Office of Intelligence Policy and Review, Ms. Lawton's primary responsibility was to review foreign intelligence surveillance requests and to represent the department before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The court was established in 1978 to rule on Government applications for surveillance and wiretaps in foreign intelligence cases.
        She was involved in the approval of wiretaps used to investigate the bombing last February of the World Trade Center in Manhattan.
        In 1983, Ms. Lawton headed an intelligence panel that called for tighter security provisions, but the provisions have yet to be approved. She also represented the department at many Congressional hearings, opposing legislative intrusion into the Government's control of intelligence security and proposals to require polygraph tests for security clearances.
        After graduating first in her class at the Georgetown Law Center in 1960, she began her career as a lawyer in the Office of Legal Counsel. She became a Deputy Assistant Attorney General in 1972 and was instrumental in drafting legislation that led to the Freedom of Information Act.
        After leaving the department in 1979 to become general counsel of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and then an administrative law officer in the White House, Ms. Lawton returned in 1982 to assume responsibility for intelligence policy.
        In 1986, the Central Intelligence Agency awarded her its Agency Seal Medallion for her work on behalf of the intelligence agencies.
        She is survived by a sister, Cathy Kenna of Sparta, N.J.
