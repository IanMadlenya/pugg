        Michael Hagerty, an actor and publicity consultant, died on Tuesday at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 39 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of AIDS, said his sister, the actress Julie Hagerty.
        Mr. Hagerty was a founder of the Production Company, an Off Off Broadway theater company, and he was featured in the film "Overboard."
        His companion was Peter Fraenkel.
        Besides Ms. Hagerty of New York, he is survived by his father and stepmother, Jerry and Pat Hagerty; his mother, Harriet Yuellig; his stepfather, Don Holbrook; a sister, Samantha Holbrook; a brother, Kim, and his grandparents, Rita and Gerald Hagerty, all of Cincinatti.
        A memorial service is to be held at 3 P.M. tomorrow at the Park Avenue Christian Church, 1010 Park Avenue, at 85th Street.
        Correction:  May 9, 1991, Thursday
        Because of an editing error, an obituary last Thursday about Michael Hagerty, an actor and publicity consultant, misstated a film credit. He did not appear in "Overboard"; the actor who did is Michael G. Hagerty.
