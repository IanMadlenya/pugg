        Don Steele, one of the pioneering disk jockeys of top 40 radio in the 60's, died on Tuesday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 61.
        The cause was lung cancer, said his wife, Shaune.
        Mr. Steele, better known as ''the Real'' Don Steele, became famous not for the songs he played but the way he announced them. Combining the fast, persuasive patter of a used car salesman, youth slang, lots of alliteration and his own made-up phrases, Mr. Steele became one of the most widely imitated disk jockeys in pop radio and, later, oldies radio.
        Mr. Steele was born on April 1, 1936, in Los Angeles. After a stint in the Army, he began taking classes in radio broadcasting and holding down small jobs at stations from Beverly Hills to Omaha. Not until he was hired as an afternoon host to help the Los Angeles station KHJ-AM (''Boss Radio'') make the transition to rock-and-roll in 1965 did his patter, and the station itself, take off. A nonsensical catch phrase he made up, ''Tina Delgado is alive, alive!,'' became his on-air calling card for the next three decades.
        Mr. Steele clinched his fame as the host of musical television shows like ''Boss City'' and ''The Real Don Steele Show'' plus a cameo on ''Bewitched.'' From the 60's to the present, he appeared in dozens of cult and low-budget movies, usually in the role of a disk jockey. Those include the Ramones movie ''Rock-and-Roll High School,'' ''The Day the Earth Moved,'' ''Death Race 2000,'' ''Eating Raoul,'' ''Gremlins,'' ''Tales From the Crypt Presents Bordello of Blood'' and ''Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park.''
        When KHJ began to flounder, Mr. Steele stood by 60's rock-and-roll, moving from oldies station to oldies station until he ended up at KRTH-FM in Los Angeles from 1975 until May, when he took time off because of illness.
        In 1995, Mr. Steele was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
        He is survived by his wife.
