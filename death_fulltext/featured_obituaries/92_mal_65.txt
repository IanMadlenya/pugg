        Marshall Sprague, who wrote books about the American West, died last Friday at St. Francis Hospital in Colorado Springs, his hometown. He was 85.
        He had had a long illness, said his wife, the former Edna Jane Ailes.
        Mr. Sprague's books included "Newport on the Rockies: the Life and Good Times of Colorado Springs" (1961, Ohio University Press), which focused on that community's history as a resort. The volume was praised by the social historian Cleveland Amory as "candid, graceful, diligently researched."
        Mr. Sprague's 1967 work "A Gallery of Dudes" (University of Nebraska Press) was lauded by one critic for its "wonderful tales about eminent commoners and titled Europeans awash in the exhilarating landscapes of America's last frontier."
        He also contributed articles and book reviews to The New York Times and, earlier, was a newspaperman in China and Paris.
        Mr. Sprague was born in Newark, Ohio, and graduated from the Lawrenceville School in Lawrenceville, N.J., and in 1930 from Princeton.
        In addition to his wife of 55 years, he is survived by two sons, Joseph and Stephen, both of Albuquerque, N.M.; a daughter, Sharon Sprague of Colorado Springs, and two grandchildren.
