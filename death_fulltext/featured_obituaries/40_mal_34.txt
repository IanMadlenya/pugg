        William L. Dawson, a composer and choral arranger, died of pneumonia on Wednesday. He was 90 years old.
        Mr. Dawson was head of the Tuskegee Institute Choir for 25 years, and was known for his choral arrangements of black folk songs.
        He was born in Anniston, Ala., on Sept. 25, 1899. He studied composition at Washburn College in Topeka, Kan., and earned a masters degree at the American Conservatory of Music in Chicago.
        His ''Negro Folk Symphony, No. 1'' was given its premiere in 1934 by the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra with Leopold Stokowski conducting. In characterized the work, Mr. Dawson said it was ''not religious, but classical, in the modern idiom.''
        ''I have never doubted the possibilities of our music,'' he once told an interviewer.
        Stokowski described Mr. Dawson's work as ''the ancient voice of Africa transferred to America.''
        Funeral services will be held tomorrow morning at 11 o'clock in the Tuskegee University Chapel.
