        Marcelo Bonevardi, an Argentine-born artist who had lived in New York part time since the late 1950's, died on Feb. 1 at Hospital Privado in Cordoba, Argentina. He was 63 and had homes in Manhattan and Cordoba.
        The cause was cancer, said his daughter, Cecilia.
        Mr. Bonevardi was born in Buenos Aires in 1929. He studied architecture at the National University of Cordoba in the late 1940's and then spent a year painting in Italy. His chosen medium was an evocative form of painted relief, carefully constructed and subtly colored, which combined suggestions of architectural detailing and early Renaissance painting within an abstract framework.
        Mr. Bonevardi came to New York City in 1958 on a Guggenheim Fellowship, and in 1963 and 1964 he received fellowships from the New School for Social Research. He had his first solo show in New York in 1960 and was represented by the Bonino Gallery for many years. His most recent exhibtion in New York was in 1989 at Mary-Anne Martin/Fine Art.
        His work is in numerous public collections in North and South America, including the Museo Rufino Tamayo in Mexico City, the National Museum of Fine Arts in Buenos Aires and the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
        Mr. Bonevardi's wife, Elena, died in 1976.
        In addition to his daughter, who lives in Manhattan, he is survived by his companion, Roxana Rivas; his mother, Margarita, of Cordoba; a son, Gustavo, and three grandchildren, all of New York City.
        Correction:  February 10, 1994, Thursday
        An obituary yesterday about Marcelo Bonevardi, an artist, misstated the city in which some of his survivors live. All except his son live in Cordoba, Argentina; the son, Gustavo, lives in New York City.
