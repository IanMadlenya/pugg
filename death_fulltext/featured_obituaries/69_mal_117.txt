        Maj. Gen. Reginald C. Harmon, retired, the first Judge Advocate General of the United States Air Force, died on Monday. He was 92 years old and lived in Arlington, Va.
        His death was reported yesterday by his daughter, Susan Harmon Meyer, who said he had died as a result of an automobile accident in Washington.
        Born on an Illinois farm, General Harmon studied law at the University of Illinois in Urbana and practiced in the state for 13 years.
        From 1929 to 1933 he was mayor of Urbana, first elected to the office at the age of 29. On Jan. 20, 1932, in one of the first such actions of its kind in the country, he ordered a five-day business shutdown to avert a panic run on local banks after two banking institutions in adjacent Champaign had closed. With few exceptions, like drug stores and food stores, all local business ceased while he persuaded residents not to withdraw money or to redeposit it.
        An officer in the Air Force reserves, he was called to active duty in World War II, performing legal duties with the Air Force. After the war, on Sept. 8, 1948, President Harry S. Truman appointed him to the newly created post of Air Force Judge Advocate General and promoted him to Major General. He served for 12 years and headed a legal department of 1,400 lawyers when he retired in 1960.
        In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his wife of 55 years, Doris Vance Harmon, three grandchildren and a great-grandchild.
