        Dennis J. Whimpey, an actuary and insurance executive, died Wednesday at his home in Avon, Conn. He was 52 years old.
        The cause of death has not been determined, a spokesman for his employer, the Cigna Corporation, said.
        At his death Mr. Whimpey was senior vice president and chief financial officer of Cigna Employee Benefits Companies.
        He spent most of his career with the Equitable Life Assurance Company of the United States, which he joined in 1962 as an actuary. He was a graduate of Knox College in Galesburg, Ill.
        In 1984, Mr. Whimpey was made a senior vice president of Equitable. In 1976 Equitable and the Hospital Corporation of America created a new company called Equicor, and in 1987 Mr. Whimpey was named its chief financial officer. Cigna bought Equicor in 1990.
        Mr. Whimpey is survived by his mother, Ruby Whimpey, of Galesburg.
