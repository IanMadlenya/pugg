        Joseph Fink, a retired deputy inspector on the New York City Police Department who in the 1960's gained a national reputation for his sensitive handling of hippies in the East Village, died on Sunday at Universal Medical Center in Pompano Beach, Fla. He was 76 years old and lived in Pompano Beach.
        He died of cancer, his son said.
        Mr. Fink, who was educated at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, had been with the Police Department for almost 30 years. For four years before his retirement in 1970, he commanded the Ninth Precinct, including the Lower East Side and Tompkins Square Park. He was named a deputy inspector in 1967.
        A former professor of police science at John Jay, Mr. Fink was the co-author of "The Community and the Police: Conflict or Cooperation," a book on his experiences in community relations. He was a past president of the Shomrim Society, an organization of Jewish police officers.
        Besides his son, Kenneth, of Coral Springs, Fla., he is survived by his wife, Sylvia, and two grandchildren.
