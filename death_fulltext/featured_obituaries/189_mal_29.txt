        Robert H. Fust, who was executive director of the New Jersey State League of Municipalities for two decades and built it into an effective advocate for the state's cities and towns, died on Oct. 4 at a hospice in Denver. He was 78.
        The cause was cancer, league officials said.
        Mr. Fust joined the league in Trenton as a research consultant in 1949 after completing graduate studies in governmental management at the University of Denver. He became assistant executive director in 1954 and served as executive director from 1957 until his retirement in 1979.
        Although the league, a nonpartisan volunteer association of elected municipal officials, had been in existence since 1915, Mr. Fust was the first director to involve the organization in lobbying the Legislature for more state aid for local governments. Today, the league has five full-time lobbyists. He was also instrumental in codifying the state's land-use statutes into the Municipal Land Use Law, one of the nation's first on land-use planning.
        He is survived by his wife, Margaret, of Denver; a daughter, Heidi Louise Hall, of Tampa, Fla.; and a sister, Ada E. Fust, of Omaha.
