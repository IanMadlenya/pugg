        Richard Ellner, a specialty T-shirt manufacturer who was behind the Broadway Dance Center, a busy commercial studio offering ballet, jazz, tap and other dance classes, died on March 31 at his home in Manhattan. He was 69.
        The cause of death had not been determined, said his daughter, Allison Ellner-Teitelbaum, the current owner and proprietor of the school.
        Mr. Ellner's principal business was Versatility Tee Shirts at 516 West 34th Street, which specializes in silk-screened apparel. He was drawn into the dance business as an investor when a dance studio to which he supplied sweatshirts fell behind in payments in the late 1970's. Mr. Ellner, himself an enthusiastic amateur tap dancer, eventually became the studio's operator.
        The studio opened in 1984 as the Broadway Dance Center. The school expanded until it occupied much of a four-story building at Broadway and 55th Street, offering more than 50 classes a week in eight studios. Its alumni include Savion Glover, the choreographer and star of ''Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk.''
        It moved to new quarters above the Hard Rock Cafe at 221 West 57th Street about a month ago.
        Besides his daughter, of Livingston, N.J., he is survived by another daughter, Lori Lehrer of Old Bridge, N.J.; his father, Bernard, of San Antonio; a sister, Cyrell Smith of Birdsboro, Pa., and five grandchildren.
