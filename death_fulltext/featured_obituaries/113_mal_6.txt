        Jeremy Sinden, an actor who built a successful stage and television career playing comic cads, died of cancer on Wednesday at a hospice in London. He was 45.
        Mr. Sinden, a son of the veteran actor Donald Sinden, had recently won some of the finest reviews of his career playing Mr. Toad in a revival of "Wind in the Willows" at the Old Vic in London.
        He also won fame for his portrayal of Boy Mulcaster in the television adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's "Brideshead Revisited."
        After working in repertory theater and spending two seasons as an assistant stage manager and understudy at the Royal Shakespeare Company, Mr. Sinden made his West End debut in a revival of R. C. Sherriff's "Journey's End." He then enrolled at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, where he polished his  skills.
        He appeared in many plays and musicals in the West End and landed roles in television and films, playing the president of the Gilbert and Sullivan Society  in "Chariots of Fire."
        He is survived by his wife, the actress Delia Lindsay; two daughters; his father, and a brother, Marc, an actor and producer.
