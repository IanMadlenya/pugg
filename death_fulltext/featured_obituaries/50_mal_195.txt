        Alfred Thorne Gregory, a former chief engineer and director of research in the engine division of the Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corporation, died on March 9 at Huntington Hospital in Huntington, L.I. He was 89 years old and lived in Huntington.
        He died of heart failure, his wife said.

        He held many patents on improvements he had developed for aircraft engines. At the request of the Navy, he developed the X-1 35-ton four-man submarine, built and launched in Oyster Bay in the early 1950's.
        He was a member of the Society of Automotive Engineers and the Institute of Aeronautical Sciences.
        He was a native of Brooklyn. He graduated from the Stevens Institute of Technology and received a doctorate in engineering from the University of Munich.
