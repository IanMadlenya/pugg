        John I. Taylor, a former president of The Boston Globe, died Sunday at his home in Natick, Mass. He was 75 years old.
        Mr. Taylor served The Globe for nearly half a century, beginning as a reporter and later as promotion director, treasurer and president.
        He once wrote, ''In an age when the truth is too often cut in half or twisted for propaganda purposes, the constant search for the full news and the publication of that news fairly and objectively is a most rewarding experience.''
        He was born on July 26, 1911, in Dedham, Mass. He was a graduate of the Pomfret School in Connecticut and a 1933 graduate of Harvard College.
        After serving three years in the Navy, Mr. Taylor went to work for The Globe. He served as its president from 1963 to 1965 and then as president of its parent corporation, Affiliated Publications. He retired in 1980.
        Mr. Taylor served on the board of directors of the American Newspaper Association's Bureau of Advertising.
        He is survived by his wife, Margaret, and four sons, John I. Jr., of Boulder, Colo., Timothy B., of New Haven, Conn., David V. N., of Philadelphia and Benjamin B., of Newton, Mass., who is assistant executive editor of The Globe.
