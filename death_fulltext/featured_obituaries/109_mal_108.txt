        Grant Sawyer, a two-erm Governor of Nevada who sought to rid the gaming industry of the influence of organized crime, died here on Monday night. He was  77.
        The cause was complications from a stroke he suffered in July 1993, his family said.
        Mr. Sawyer, a Democrat, was elected Governor in 1958 at the age of 38, defeating Gov. Charles H. Russell, a Republican seeking a third term.
        During his two terms, Governor Sawyer created the state Equal Rights Commission, pushed for economic development and diversity and fashioned the Gaming Control Act of 1959. He also created the Nevada Gaming Commission that year, urging state gaming regulators to cleanse the gaming industry of underworld influence.
        In recent years he Sawyer had been a leader in the fight against a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, where the Federal Government wants to store  77,000 tons of radioactive waste.
        In his first term as Governor, Mr. Sawyer took on the issue of race relations at a time when hotels and restaurants in Nevada were segregated. When the Legislature emasculated a civil rights bill he sought, he devised an unexpected  end run. He threatened to decree that discrimination was a violation of the gaming licenses of major hotel owners. "That worked miraculously," he said.
        In 1962, Mr. Sawyer was re-elected with more than 66 percent of the vote, but in 1966 he to win a third term, losing narrowly to his Lieutenant Governor, Paul Laxalt, a Republican.
        Mr. Sawyer is survived by his wife, Bette, a daughter, Gail Sawyer, and a brother, Harry Sawyer Jr.
