        The cause of death was heart disease, said a son, John M. Youngdahl.

He earned a master's degree from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in 1938 and a doctorate in economics from the University of Minnesota in 1947.

        In 1943, he became a staff economist at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, and he was promoted to assistant director of research in 1952. Mr. Youngdahl left the Fed in 1954.
        He is survived by his wife, Catherine, of Tequesta; three sons, Carl R.

        Correction:  August 19, 1998, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, an obituary on Monday about C. Richard Youngdahl, who led the securities firm of Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, misstated the location of George Washington University, where Mr. Youngdahl taught. It is in Washington, not St. Louis.
