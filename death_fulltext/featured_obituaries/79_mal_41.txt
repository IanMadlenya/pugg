        He known for his work in computer "programming languages" like Algol 90, Bliss, Pascal and Ada, which are used to write computer programs.
        Born Arie Nicolaas Habermann in Groningen, the Netherlands, he earned a doctorate in applied mathematics at the Technical University of Eindhoven in 1967. He came to the United States a year later as a research scientist in Carnegie Mellon's Computer Science Department. He joined the faculty in 1969 and advanced to full professor in 1974.
        At Carnegie Mellon he also worked to establish its Software Engineering Institute in 1985.
        Dr. Habermann is survived by his wife, Marta Blom Habermann; a son, Frits, of Seattle; three daughters, Eveline Killian of Burlington, Vt., and Irene and Marianne Habermann of Pittsburgh, and two grandchildren.
