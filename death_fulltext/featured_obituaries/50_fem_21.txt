        Pilar Primo de Rivera, a fascist leader during the Spanish Civil War, died today in Madrid.
        There were conflicting versions of Miss Primo de Rivera's age. The EFE news agency gave her date of birth as Nov. 5, 1910, which would make her 80. But the Espasa encyclopedia and other local publications said she was born on Nov. 4, 1912.
        She died of a heart ailment, her family said.
        Miss Primo de Rivera was a co-founder of the women's branch of the Falange, Spain's fascist movement, in 1934 and took part in the right-wing Government headed by Franco after the 1936-39 civil war.
        Her brother, Jose Antonio, was the leader of the Falange until he was executed early in the war by the Government of the Second Republic, against which Franco revolted.
        Her father, Gen. Miguel Primo de Rivera, was dictator of Spain from 1923 to 1930.
        Franco named Miss Primo de Rivera the Countess of Castillo de la Mota in 1960. She retired from the Falange in 1977, two years after Franco's death paved the way for a return to democracy.
