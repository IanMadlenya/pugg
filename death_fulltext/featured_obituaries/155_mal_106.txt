        Woodrow Borah, a former professor of Latin American history at the University of California at Berkeley who documented the decimation of Mexico's native population resulting from the Spanish conquest, died on Dec. 10  at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, Calif. He was 86 and lived in Berkeley.
        Working with a colleague, Sherburne F. Cook, Dr. Borah began by studying the impact of the Spanish conquest and colonialization on the native populations in Mexico and elsewhere in Mesoamerica.
        There were no surviving written records of population size before the Spanish arrived in 1520, but Dr. Borah and his colleague made reliable estimates based on records of food production and other indicators.
        They discovered that between the early 16th century and the middle of the 17th century, native population in Mesoamerica fell from about 10 million to 2 million.
        They identified the chief causes as the Spaniards' imposition of rapid-paced labor and the epidemics of diseases transmitted by Europeans.
        Born on Dec. 23, 1912, in Utica, Miss., Dr. Borah graduated from high school in Los Angeles and attended the University of California at Berkeley, where he earned his bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees.
        He taught briefly at Princeton University before joining the United States State Department as an analyst in the Office of Strategic Services during World War II.
        He joined Berkeley's history department in 1948 and retired in 1980.
        Dr. Borah is survived by his wife, Terry; a son, Jonathan, of Oakland, and a daughter, Ruth Borah of Voorschoten, the Netherlands.
