        Michael Scott, a publisher and editor of trade publications, died of a heart attack last Thursday at Group Health Hospital in Seattle. He was 65 years old and had lived in Seattle since 1977.
        Mr. Scott, a longtime resident of the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn, published and edited several journals in the cosmetology and textile fields from 1942 to 1972, including American Hairdresser and Tempo, the publication of the furriers' union.
        In 1975 he established The Crafts Report, an information letter for crafts workers that has grown from a four-page newsletter to a 56-page monthly newspaper.
        A past president of the International Guild of Crafts Journalists, Authors and Photographers, he is the author of a standard text, ''The Crafts Business Encyclopedia,'' published in 1977 by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Sheila Kanefsky; a son, Tim, of Portland, Ore., and a daughter, Janie, of Oakland, Calif.
