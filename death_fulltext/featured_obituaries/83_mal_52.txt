        Frederick D. Forsch, a retired New York investment banker who amassed one of the best collections of Churchill memorabilia outside official British and American archives, died last Friday at the Amsterdam Nursing Home in Manhattan. A resident of Manhattan, he was 78.
        The cause was complications from diabetes, his family said.
        Mr. Forsch, a native of New York City, built his collection over half a century. His holdings include signed first editions of nearly every book by Sir Winston, as well as manuscripts and more than 100 unpublished letters written between 1893 and 1960. Some of them are marked "secret."
        There are autographed photos received by Churchill from Stalin, Harry S. Truman and Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, among others. One picture showing him at the Potsdam conference in 1945 with Stalin and Truman was signed by all three. Anonymous Gift to Dartmouth
        Earlier this year, Mr. Forsch gave the collection anonymously to Dartmouth College, of which he was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate.
        He held a law degree from Yale University. He served as a captain of intelligence in the Army Air Forces in World War II and was assigned to the Free French as a liaison officer.
        Mr. Forsch was a securities analyst and corporate officer with Lazard Freres and with Kuhn, Loeb before he started his own investment firm, Frederick D. Forsch Inc. He retired in 1987. He was a past vice president of the United Hospital Fund of New York and a trustee of Mount Sinai Hospital and Medical Center.
        Mr. Forsch's survivors include his wife of 43 years, Lillian Sagar Forsch, and a sister, Annabelle F. Prager of Manhattan.
