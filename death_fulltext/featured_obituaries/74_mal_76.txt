        Maurice Frey, a retired dentist and volunteer in international humanitarian efforts, died on March 8 at his home in Southampton, L.I., at the age of 83.  He also resided in Manhattan.
        The cause of death was heart failure and pneumonia, his family said.
        Dr. Frey was born in Rzeszow, Poland. Because he was Jewish, his educational opportunities there were limited, so he went to France. After training as a dental surgeon in the early 1930's, he opened a practice in Paris.
        On the day the Nazis entered Paris in 1940, Dr. Frey fled on foot for Lisbon. There he organized a dental clinic for Polish refugees. In 1941 he boarded one of the last refugee ships to escape Lisbon and moved to Brooklyn.
        After receiving a dental degree at Tufts University, he practiced on Park Avenue in Manhattan from 1947 until retiring in 1988. His patients included the staffs of many African and other French-speaking missions to the United Nations.
        The United Nations International Refugee Organization sent Dr. Frey to Germany in 1949 to conduct medical retraining for physicians and dentists displaced by the war.
        From 1961 to 1963, he spent three months each year as a volunteer at Dr. Albert Schweitzer's hospital in Gabon, Africa, and was said to be the only dentist in the nation at the time. Dr. Frey became a trustee of the Albert Schweitzer Fellowship, which fosters medical training and service in Africa and elsewhere.
        Surviving are his wife of 27 years, the former Anne Parfitt; a son, Erik, of Boston; a daughter, Karren Frey of Manhattan; a brother, Louis, of Manhattan, and two sisters, Ida Banat of Marseilles, France, and Regina Nagiel of Deerfield Beach, Fla.
