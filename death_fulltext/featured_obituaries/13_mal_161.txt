        Edward M. Knabusch, who began making chairs in a garage in the 1920's and later founded the La-Z-Boy Chair Company with a cousin, died here Thursday. He was 88 years old.
        Mr. Knabusch and the cousin, Edwin J. Shoemaker, started the Floral City Furniture Company in 1927 and built novelty furniture to be peddled in Detroit. ''The Gossiper,'' a telephone stand with a built-in seat, sold so well that a large manufacturer copied it.
        The two men then modified a wooden porch chair so that its seat moved forward as its back reclined. On the advice of dealers, they made an upholstered version. By May 1929, the La-Z-Boy had been patented and 13 had been made for a furniture show in Grand Rapids.
        The company survived the Depression, sometimes accepting wheat, corn, cows and coal for chairs. In 1935 it built a showroom and in May 1941 the La-Z-Boy Chair Company was incorporated.
        In World War II the company made seats and backs for tanks, torpedo boats, turret guns and armored cars in World War II. Production for civilian consumption was resumed in 1946. A platform rocker was introduced in 1951, and the Reclina-Rocker was introduced in 1960.
        Mr. Knabusch resigned as chairman of his concern in 1985. His son, Charles, took over as board chairman and is president of the company. Mr. Shoemaker, now 81, is still vice chairman, executive vice president of engineering and a director.
        Besides his son, Mr. Knabusch is survived by a daughter, seven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. His funeral is scheduled for Sunday.
