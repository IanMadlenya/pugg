        Frank Umont, an umpire for 20 years in the American League, died at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., yesterday. He was 73 years old and had suffered a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Umont, who worked in the American League from 1954 until retiring after the 1973 season, umpired in four World Series, four All-Star Games, and a league championship series. Over the latter part of his career, he wore eyeglasses on the job. Before becoming an umpire, Mr. Umont was a tackle for the New York Giants from 1943 to 1945.
        Mr. Umont, whose wife, Doris, died six months ago, is survived by a son, Frank Jr.; a daughter, Cathy Glennon, and three grandchildren.
