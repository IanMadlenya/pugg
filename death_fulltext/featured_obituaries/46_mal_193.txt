        Louis Clapes, who served four consecutive terms as mayor of Stamford, Conn., died last Tuesday at St. Joseph Medical Center in Stamford. He was 73 years old and a lifelong Stamford resident.
        Mr. Clapes died after surgery on an intestinal tumor, his son Anthony said.
        Mr. Clapes, a Republican, was elected mayor in 1975 and remained in that post until he retired in 1983. It was a period of revival for the city, which attracted corporations and thousands of employees from New Haven and New York.
        Mr. Clapes graduated from what is now Pace University in Manhattan in 1938, specializing in advertising and marketing. His first job was with the Stamford Municipal Welfare Department. From 1956 to 1962, he was a member of the Board of Education.
        In 1963, Mr. Clapes was elected town clerk and remained in that job until 1975, when he defeated the Democratic incumbent mayor.
        After 1983, he served as an officer of the First National Bank of Stamford.
        Besides his son Anthony, of Ridgefield, Conn., he is survived by his wife, Christine; two other sons, Lawrence, of Ridgefield, and William, of Stamford; two daughters, Rosemary Rafaelle of Stamford and Louise Wilson of Newtown, Conn., and seven grandchildren.
