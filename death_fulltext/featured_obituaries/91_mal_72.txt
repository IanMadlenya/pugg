        Dr. George Gewirtz, a psychiatrist at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 37.
        The cause was AIDS, his family said.
        Dr. Gewirtz's research sought to develop new drug treatments for psychiatric disorders, especially schizophrenia. He emphasized the biological rather than the psychological basis of mental illness.
        He was an assistant professor of clinical psychiatry at the College of Physicians and Surgeons and in 1992 also became director of research at the Creedmoor Psychiatric Hospital in Bellerose, Queens.
        Dr. Gewirtz graduated from Columbia College in 1979 and received an M.D. degree from Columbia in 1984.
        He is survived by his companion, Jeffrey Roth of Manhattan; his father, Herman, of Manhattan, and two brothers, Paul, of New Haven and Jonathan, of Northfield, N.J.
