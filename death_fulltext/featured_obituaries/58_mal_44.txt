        John Jahr, one of Germany's most prominent postwar publishers, died today in Hamburg, his company said. He was 91 years old.
        The company, Gruner & Jahr G.m.b.H., said he died of heart failure.
        Gruner & Jahr counts among its publications the popular Stern weekly magazine and also has a quarter share in Der Spiegel, Germany's leading news weekly.
        Mr. Jahr was born in Hamburg. He worked for a Communist Party weekly and a women's monthly in the late 1920's. Both publications were banned by the Nazis in 1933. Ordered to leave Hamburg, Mr. Jahr moved to Berlin, where he published a nonpolitical women's magazine and ran a bookstore.  After the war, Mr. Jahr and the publisher Axel Springer negotiated with the British occupying forces in Hamburg to regain a publisher's license in 1947. Mr. Jahr began his postwar career publishing Constance, which for years was Germany's most influential women's magazine.
        From 1950 to 1962 Mr. Jahr was managing editor of Der Spiegel. He sold his share in Der Spiegel to Richard Gruner in the early 1960's, then rejoined Mr. Gruner in forming the publishing house Gruner & Jahr G.m.b.H. in 1965.
        Mr. Jahr retired in 1970 but in 1972 assumed an advisory post, which he gave up in 1987.
        He is survived by three sons and a daughter, all in the publishing business.
