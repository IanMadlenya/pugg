        Milt Gaston, who had the most Hall of Fame teammates and managers in baseball history, died on Friday, three months after becoming only the eighth major leaguer to turn 100 years old.
        Gaston, who pitched from 1924-34, died in his sleep at a rehabilitation center in Hyannis, Mass., near his Cape Cod home in Marstons Mills, his nephew Don Lyons said.
        Gaston played alongside Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and George Sisler -- 17 future Hall of Famers in all -- while with the Yankees, the St. Louis Browns, the Washington Senators, the Boston Red Sox and the Chicago White Sox.
        Gaston's lifetime record was 97-164, and his .372 winning percentage put him  near the bottom on the career list. Although he twice led the American League in losses, he made it into the record books with a couple of unusual accomplishments.
        He shares the major league mark for allowing the most hits (14) while pitching a shutout and also took part in the most double plays (4) by a pitcher  in a game.
        Of the 14,000-plus players to appear in the majors, only 8 made it to age 100. Gaston was the only one, however, to play 10 years in the big leagues.
        He is survived by several nieces and nephews. His brother Alex, who caught Milt when they played together on the Red Sox, died in 1976 at age 82.
