        Albert Ernst Hemsing, a documentary film maker and former Foreign Service officer with the United States Information Agency, died on Tuesday at his home in Brewster, Mass. He was 76.
        The cause of death was heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Hemsing worked for the Marshall Plan film unit in Paris in the 1950's, supervising more than 100 films made to build support for postwar reconstruction in Europe.
        A native of Barmen, Germany, Mr. Hemsing was brought to New York as an infant. He graduated from City College and earned a master's degree in sociology at New York University in 1947.
        Returning from Europe, he joined the newly formed U.S.I.A. He served as inspector general for the Foreign Service and retired as minister counselor at the embassy in New Delhi. He then directed the American Institute in Freiburg, Germany.
        He and his wife, Esther Davidson Hemsing, worked on the documentary ''The Yellow Star'' (1981), on the Nazi persecution of Jews. It was nominated for an Academy Award.
        Besides his wife, Mr. Hemsing is survived by a daughter, Josephine Claudia Hemsing of Manhattan.
