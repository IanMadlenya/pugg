        Leslie MacMitchell, the United States' best young mile runner just before World War II and the first college undergraduate to win the Sullivan Award as the nation's outstanding amateur athlete, died March 21 in San Jose, Calif. He was 85.
        His wife, Jill MacMitchell, announced his death.
        MacMitchell was still a student at New York University when he was dominating mile races, competing against rivals like Gil Dodds and Chuck Fenske, and occasionally Glenn Cunningham. The writer Quentin Reynolds said of MacMitchell in 1940: ''One day he'll be hailed as the greatest runner of all time, the only man ever to accomplish that Miracle Mile, running the distance in 4 minutes flat.''
        He took a big step toward four minutes in 1941. The 5-foot-11, 158-pound MacMitchell won the mile in all five Madison Square Garden intercollegiate meets that year; in the Baxter Mile, he equaled Cunningham and Fenske's world indoor record of 4 minutes 7.4 seconds.
        Outdoors, MacMitchell won the N.C.A.A. mile and the Amateur Athletic Union 1,500-meter title. ''It was one of those years I almost felt I could do anything,'' he told The San Francisco Chronicle in 2004.
        In 1941, at 20, MacMitchell became the youngest Sullivan Award winner, but he would never be as dominant again. In June 1942, he received a degree in physical education. A month later, he joined the Navy and had combat duty as a lieutenant in the Atlantic and the Pacific.
        When he returned to indoor running in 1946, he was disappointed in his times. ''Running on the steel deck of a light cruiser is not the best way to train,'' he told The Chronicle. He also began working in administrative positions at N.Y.U. When he failed to make the Olympic team in 1948, he realized he should retire.
        ''By that time,'' he told The New York Times in 2004, ''things were going downhill. I was getting slower, and I wasn't winning. I was working in New York until at least 5 o'clock, and I would then go to Central Park to run.'' And, he noted, he had a family.
        Thomas Leslie MacMitchell was born Sept. 26, 1920, in New York City. At 7, he spent four months in bed with diphtheria and had to learn to walk again. At George Washington High School in Manhattan, he won national schoolboy championships in cross-country and in the indoor 1,000 yards.
        MacMitchell and his first wife, the former Mary Lee, divorced in the late 1950's. In addition to his wife, the former Jill Kudlich, MacMitchell is survived by two sons, Thomas, of Redwood City, Calif., and Gordon, of Carlsbad, Calif.; two daughters, Marianne and Melanie MacMitchell, both of Carlsbad; and three grandchildren.
        The four-minute mile was finally achieved, and simultaneously eclipsed, by Roger Bannister in 1954, when he ran 3:59.4 in Oxford, England. The current world record is 3:43.13, set by Hicham el-Guerrouj of Morocco in 1999.
        ''I think eventually I could have run four minutes,'' MacMitchell said, ''but we weren't thinking about that then. We never trained as hard as we might have. We didn't know enough to do that. But all in all, I'm very happy with my running career.''
