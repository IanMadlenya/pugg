        The Rev. Dale Stewart Alexy, an Episcopal priest who led demonstrations last year against the curtailment of bus service in Jamaica, Queens, died of cancer on Monday at the rectory of St. Stephen's Church, where he lived. He was 57 years old.
        Mr. Alexy was ordained an Episcopal priest in 1958, following his graduation from Philadelphia Divinity School. He had served as Rector of St. Stephen's for the last 10 years. Before that, he was rector of St. James Episcopal Church in Bradley Beach, N.J., at St. Mark's Church in Pittsburgh and at other churches in New Jersey and California.
        In 1989 he decried a decision by the New York City Transit Authority to curtail bus service near the church, at 89-26 168th Street in Jamaica, and led pickets in a march outside Metropolitan Transportation Authority headquarters. He contended that the loss of service made it difficult for many older parishioners to get to the church. His pleas, however, went unheeded.
        Mr. Alexy is survived by two daughters, Ann Lewis of Boynton Beach, Fla., and Mary Alexy of Baltimore; a son, Thomas, of Hoboken, N.J.; and his parents, Ethel and Gustav Alexy of Pittsburgh.
