        Henry Koster, the director of such films as ''Harvey'' and ''The Bishop's Wife'' died of complications after liver surgery Wednesday in Camarillo, Calif. He was 83 years old.
        Mr. Koster directed dozens of movies in Europe and the United States over four decades. His name originally was Hermann Kosterlitz, and he was born in Berlin. He attended the Academy of Fine Arts in Berlin and worked as a painter, cartoonist, reporter and film critic before turning to screenwriting in 1925. He wrote 50 scripts by 1931, and made his directing debut in 1932.
        Mr. Koster fled to France when the Nazis seized power in 1933, and he made several movies in Europe during the next three years. The director arrived in Hollywood in 1936, and his first American films included ''Three Smart Girls,'' ''100 Men and a Girl'' and ''It Started With Eve.'' The popularity of these films, which starred Deanna Durbin, are said to have possibly saved Universal Pictures from financial disaster. He was nominated for an Academy Award for directing ''The Bishop's Wife,'' a 1947 comedy starring Cary Grant, David Niven and Loretta Young. Directed Stewart and Burton
        Mr. Koster's best-known film was ''Harvey'' (1950), based on Mary Chase's play, with James Stewart as the companion of an invisible six-foot-tall rabbit. He also directed ''My Cousin Rachel'' (1952), Richard Burton's first film. ''The Robe,'' which he directed in 1953, was the first movie to be shot in Cinemascope. His many other credits included ''Music for Millions'' (1944), ''The Inspector General'' (1949), ''Flower Drum Song'' (1961), ''Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation'' (1962) and ''The Singing Nun'' (1966).
        Mr. Koster is survived by his wife, Peggy Moran, a former actress, of Camarillo, and two sons, Robert and Peter.
