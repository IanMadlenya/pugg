        Dr. Henry F. Jackson, a Hunter College professor and an expert on United States foreign policy toward Africa, died on Thursday at Daniel Freeman Hospital in Los Angeles. He was 52 years old and lived in Los Angeles.
        He died of toxoplasmosis, kidney failure and pneumonia, said a friend, Franklin D. Roosevelt 3d.
        Dr. Jackson was chairman of the department of black and Puerto Rican studies at Hunter College for four years. Since January 1990, he had been a visiting professor in political science and Afro-American studies at the University of California at Los Angeles. He was recently awarded a Fulbright Fellowship to conduct a research project at the Center for Policy Studies at the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa.
        Dr. Jackson wrote two books, "From the Congo to Soweto: U.S. Foreign policy Toward Africa Since 1960" (1982) and "The F.L.N. in Algeria: Party Development in a Revolutionary Society" (1977).
        Dr. Jackson saw his academic achievements as the triumph of a boy born into a poor farming family near Warm Springs, Ga., where he spied on the Ku Klux Klan on midnight rides. He lost his parents by the time he was 5. He entered college, he said, "with little more than confidence and a small grant from the B'nai B'rith Foundation."
        Dr. Jackson is survived by his stepsisters, Vanessa Brown and Valerie Davis, both of Anniston, Ala.
