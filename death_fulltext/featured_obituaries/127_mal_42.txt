        William Lincer, the principal violist of the New York Philharmonic from 1943 to 1972, died on July 31 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. He was 90 and lived in Manhattan.
        His wife, Mary, said the cause was an aneurysm.
        Mr. Lincer was born in Malverne, N.Y., and he began his musical studies as a violinist. He attended the Institute of Musical Art, which later became the Juilliard School, and was a student of Samuel Gardner, in violin, and Bernard Wagenaar, in composition. After graduating he continued his studies at Harvard.
        Before he joined the New York Philharmonic, Mr. Lincer performed with his own Lincer String Quartet and was the violist in the Gordon String Quartet for seven years. He was also the principal violist of the Cleveland Orchestra from 1941 to 1943, when he returned to New York to succeed Zoltan Kurthy at the Philharmonic.
        During his 29 years at the Philharmonic, Mr. Lincer performed more than 4,000 times and made 57 appearances as a soloist.
        He played the viola solo in Strauss's ''Don Quixote'' in Leonard Bernstein's conducting debut with the Philharmonic, and he played several contemporary works, including Robert Starer's Concerto for Viola, Strings and Jean Rivier's Concertino for Viola and Chamber Orchestra.
        Mr. Lincer also did some musicological detective work in the early 1950's. After he received a copy of the viola part from a lost Mozart work, a Sinfonia Concertante for Violin, Viola and Cello, he searched through libraries until he found a copy of a 19th-century edition in Salzburg.
        He gave the New York premiere of the single-movement work with the Philharmonic in 1955.
        After his retirement from the Philharmonic in 1972, Mr. Lincer taught at the Juilliard School and privately.  In addition to his wife, he is survived by a sister, Janet Bernstein of Florida.
