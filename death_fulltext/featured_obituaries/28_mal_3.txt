        An article in the Media Business pages on April 24 about the ownership of Italian publications referred incorrectly to a leading Italian newspaper, La Stampa, and its coverage of an attempted takeover of a Belgian holding company by the financier Carlo de Benedetti. The newspaper, owned by Giovanni Agnelli, a business rival of Mr. de Benedetti, carried articles on the front page as well as inside.
