        Richard J. Margolis, a freelance writer and columnist on social issues for The New Leader magazine, died yesterday at Yale-New Haven Hospital. He was 61 years old.
        He died of heart failure, said his wife, Diane. He had a kidney transplant two months ago.
        In addition to freelancing for The Smithsonian magazine, Harper's, The New York Times Magazine and The New Republic, Mr. Margolis wrote books for children and adults. He wrote widely about migrant farm workers, the elderly, Indians and other minorities.
        His most recent book is "Risking Old Age in America" (Westview Press, 1990). He also wrote "All Their Days, All Their Nights," a prose poem about shack life in the United States, published by the Rural Housing Alliance (1971), and "Something to Build On," a report about self-housing, published by the American Friends Service Committee (1969). "Homes of the Brave," a report on migrant farm worker housing, was published in 1981 by Rural America, an advocacy group of which he was a founder and the first chairman. The Children's Books
        Mr. Margolis's children's books include "Secrets of a Small Brother" (Macmillan, 1984), a volume of poetry that won a Christopher Award; "Looking for a Place" (Lippincott, 1969) and three Big Bear books: "Wish Again, Big Bear" (Macmillan, 1972), "Big Bear to the Rescue" (Greenwillow, 1975) and "Big Bear, Spare That Tree" (Greenwillow, 1980).
        Mr. Margolis was born in St. Paul on June 30, 1929, and received bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Minnesota.
        He is survived by his wife, Diane Rothbard Margolis of New Haven; two sons, Philip E., of Zurich, and Harry S., of Cambridge, Mass., and by a brother, Dr. Philip M., of Ann Arbor, Mich.
