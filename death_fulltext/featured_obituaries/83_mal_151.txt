        Dr. Hans Steinitz, an editor of the German-language newspaper Aufbau for many years and the former president of the Foreign Press Association in New York, died on Wednesday at the Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged in the Bronx. He was 81.
        The cause was a series of strokes, said his daughter, Dr. Lucy Kiekebusch-Steinitz.
        Born in Berlin, Dr. Steinitz received a doctorate in political science from the University of Basel in 1933. He moved to Manhattan in 1947 and in 1964 joined Aufbau, which had a wide circulation among German Jewish immigrants, as an associate editor. He became its chief editor in 1966, and served for 20 years.
        He was the president of the Foreign Press Association from 1959 to 1961, and wrote several books dealing with history and travel.
        He is survived by his wife of 46 years, Lore Steinitz of Manhattan, and his daughter, of Columbia, Md.
