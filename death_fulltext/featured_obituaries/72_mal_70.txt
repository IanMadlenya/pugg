        Charles Tillon, a Communist leader of the French Resistance and a Cabinet minister under Charles de Gaulle, died Tuesday night. He was 95.
        Family members said Mr. Tillon died at a convalescent home.
        Mr. Tillon was head of the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans, who battled the German occupation in World War II. In the 1930's he was a member of the International Brigades, foreign volunteers who unsuccessfully fought the Fascist forces of Gen. Francisco Franco in the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War.
        Mr. Tillon was Air Minister at the end of the war in 1945, then headed the armament and reconstruction ministries under the governments of de Gaulle, Felix Gouin and Georges Bidault from 1945 to 1947. He was a member of the National Assembly from 1946 to 1955.
        Mr. Tillon was a member of the political bureau of the French Communist Party from 1944 to 1952.
        In 1968, Mr. Tillon broke the silence of his retirement to protest the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia. In 1970, with other Communists, he published a manifesto titled "It Is No Longer Possible to Remain Silent," criticizing Communist Party operations.
        Mr. Tillon, the son of a banker, was born July 3, 1897, in Rennes and began working in 1916 as a navy mechanic.
        He was a labor organizer in the 1920's and rose in the ranks of the Communist Party in France.
        He wrote several books, including "The Worker and the Republic" in 1983, for which he was honored by the Academie Francaise.
        He was given the title of commander of the Legion of Honor on Jan. 1.
