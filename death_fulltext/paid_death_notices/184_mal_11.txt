        BASCH-Morris. We mourn the loss of our beloved friend and treasured colleague. A gentle soul, his warmth and humor endeared him to all who knew him. Heartfelt condolences to Sylvia, Debbie, Jeff, Norman, Irene, Heshi, Wendy and all the grandchildren. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. The Greenblatt Family
