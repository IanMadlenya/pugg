        SMITH--William. The Board of Directors, residents and staff of The Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale, are deeply saddened at the passing of William Smith, beloved husband of Helen, father of Howard Smith and Andrea Rubin, father-in-law of Thelma Smith. Bill was a proud and strong man who was devoted to his family and friends. We will miss his wonderful sense of humor, unusual warmth and great friendship. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews, and hope that the entire Smith family will be comforted by fond memories. Daniel Reingold, Exec. VP
