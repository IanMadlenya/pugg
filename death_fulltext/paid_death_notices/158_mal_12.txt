        WATKINS-T.H. The Board of Directors and Staff of The National Book Foundation mourn the passing of T.H. Watkins, distinguished historian and champion of the American wilderness. Tom was a devoted member of our institutional family for over a decade, as a National Book Award Nonfiction Finalist for ''Righteous Pilgrim;'' as Chairman for the Nonfiction Jury for the Awards; and as a pioneering teacher in ''American Voices,'' the Foundation's educational outreach program on Native American reservations. Our condolences to his wife, Joan, and the Watkins family. Deborah E. Wiley, Chairman of the Board Neil Baldwin, Executive Director Meg Kearney, Assistant Director
