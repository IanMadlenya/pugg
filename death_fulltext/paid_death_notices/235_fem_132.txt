        DEUTSCHER--Martha, On Thursday, August 17, 2006, at home just shy of her 84th birthday. Martha worked for Tass, was a foreign films publicist, ran an advertising agency, taught school, and owned a chain of retail stores. Her varied experiences, her understanding of people, and her business acumen culminated in a successful career as a real estate broker. Martha was brilliant, possessed of a boundless appetite for living, for politics, food, ideas, and New York. She was a voracious reader, and a lover and supporter of theater, opera, music, ballet and art. In retirement she shared her enthusiasm for the arts with New York City public school kids. Martha was the mother of the late Elizabeth Bard Levy. She is survived by her son John Benjamin Levy; her daughter-in-law Karen; her step grandchildren Tayler, Morgan and Jay Roundtree; her brothers-in-law William Kushner and Richard Manoff; her sisters-in-law Grace Feldman and Marilyn Kreisberg; her nieces and nephews Lisa and Maria Deutscher; Daniel, Judy, and Richard Feldman; Julian Kreisberg; Eric, Lesley and Tony Kushner; Gregg and Robert Manoff; and Deena Zarlin; and many grandnieces and grandnephews. Donations may be made to The Public Theater. In lieu of flowers, please vote Democratic in the midterm elections. Service Monday 11:15 AM at ''The Riverside'' 76th Street and Amsterdam Ave. $(6$)DEUTSCHER--Martha. The Public Theater deeply mourns the loss of Martha Deutscher, great friend of the theater.
