        WAGNER--Sima. It is with great sadness we announce the passing of Sima Wagner. For sixty-six years Sima was the devoted wife of Rubin Wagner, who survives her, the loving mother of Harry and Myra, Leon and Marsha and grandmother of Elliot, Lauren, Gabriel and Daniel. Born in Vilna, now Vilnius, Lithuania, daughter of Leah and Yisroel Benosher, Sima was the devoted older sister of Fania, Sharon and Merele of whom only Fania and Sharon survived the Holocaust. Young and in love Sima and Ruby eloped in February 1940 as the world erupted into war. Their daughter, Sheyna, born in 1941, was taken from Sima during a concentration camp selection. Separated during the war and imprisoned in numerous concentration camps Sima miraculously reunited with her husband after the war living in a displaced persons camp in Heidenheim, Germany between 1945 and 1949. They landed in New York with $8 to their name, lived in Brooklyn whereupon Sima became a member of the International Ladies Garment Worker's Union in order to help support her family. She reared her family in Jewish homes in Huntington, Roslyn and Aventura, Florida and always carried herself with elegance, dignity and discipline and was widely respected and loved in the community of survivors. Throughout her life Sima Wagner gave comfort and care to her sisters, niece, nephews, and cousins living a life devoted to family, friends, charity, Holocaust Remembrance and Am Yisrael Chai.
