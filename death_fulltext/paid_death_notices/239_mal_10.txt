        JONES--John, Haydn. Riverdale Country School extends its deepest sympathies to the family of former headmaster John Haydn Jones, father of Jeremy, Jeffery, Chris, Shami, and Jenny, as well as Moto Imai, and beloved grandfather of 12 and greatgrandfather of 3. John serviced as Riverdale's second headmaster from 1949-1972; during his tenure he saw the completion of a number of building projects as well as the deeding over of the Perkins Estate, thereby creating the River Campus. Part of our School Family for more than 55 years, John will be greatly missed by generations of Riverdalians, who will remember him as a great educator with a profound respect for teachers and teaching.
