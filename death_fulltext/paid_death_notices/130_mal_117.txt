        MONT-Jeffrey B. On November 9, after a long and courageous battle against AIDS. Through it all, Jeff never gave up or lost his spirit. To the very end, he was alert and grateful for the friends in his life. We remember Jeff for his work on Broadway and love of the theatre and his devotion to exploration of every corner of the globe, often on rollerblades. We will miss his wit, his intellect, his intense curiosity and most of all, his devotion to his friends. Jeff wanted no special memorial service and none is planned. Donations in his name can be made to the Gay Men's Health Crisis, Attention: The Development Department, 119 West 24th Street, New York City 10011.
