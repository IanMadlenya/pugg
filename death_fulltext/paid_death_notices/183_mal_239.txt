        WURZBURGER-Walter S., Rabbi, Dr. We met every Sunday morning for more than 20 years, after services, for an intimate and friendly coffee hour. Every subject was allowed. Torah for certain, Jewish affairs and current events-Israeli, American and wordly, business news, the world of scholarship-Jewish in general and what is new in the ranks of leadership, current and upcoming. In all, Rabbi Wurzburger was our sparkplug, the catalyst for both our serious and our light discussions. He hardly ever failed to include a thought of his great teacher, Rabban Shel Yisrael, Rabbi J.B. Soloveitchik. Rabbi Wurzburger's knowledge, insights and intuitions were astounding and above all else, they were Jewish and humane. We will truly miss him. Yehi Zichro Baruch. Rabbi Joel (and Dr. D'Vorah) Balsam, Rabbi Judah (and Ruth) Feinerman, Cantor Yitzhak (and Miriam) Freund, Leo (and Adele) Goldschmidt, Carmi (and Pearl) Schwartz.
        WURZBURGER-Walter S., Rabbi. The International Jewish Committee on Interreligious Consultations mourns the passing of Rabbi Walter Wurzburger, a learned and penetrating thinker of profound ethical sensitivity who was in the vanguard of strengthening relations between the Jewish people and members of other faiths.

        WURZBURGER-Rabbi Walter. It was a privilege to be a member of your congregation and an honor to be your friend. Laura M. Rosenthal
