        SCHNEIDER -- Joel. The Board of Trustees, friends and colleagues at Sesame Workshop and around the world mourn the loss of Joel Schneider. He passed away on Sunday, September 12. It goes without saying how much we will miss this gentle man for his caring, inspiring, knowledgeable, witty and decent contributions made each and every day to Sesame Workshop's mission. He deeply believed in our work and was an outstanding ambassador in this country and around the world, helping children reach their highest potential through informal education. In his memory, Sesame Workshop will establish the ''Joel Schneider International Research Fund for Global Health'' to honor his passion and continue the Workshop's global health initiative--which he so ably led. In lieu of flowers, the family has requested that donations be made to this fund at Sesame Workshop, One Lincoln Plaza, New York, NY 10023. We are so grateful for the time we had with Joel and for the impact he made on so many lives. Our thoughts are with his family at this time. Gary E. Knell President and CEO Vincent A. Mai Chairman of the Board
        SCHNEIDER--Dr. Joel. In loving memory of our adored friend, mentor and colleague, Dr. Joel Schneider, forever in our hearts. With love, Ed, Outreach, SW
