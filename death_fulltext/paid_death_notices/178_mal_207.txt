        WOJCAK-Randy. The Board of Directors, staff & volunteers of God's Love We Deliver are deeply saddened by the loss of our friend & former Board member, Randy Wojcak. Randy was always an active Board member & committee participant, & we are grateful to have known his dedication & loyal support. His enthusiasm for our efforts, coupled with his willingness to assist us with our services, enriched the lives of thousands of New Yorkers living with HIV/AIDS. We extend our sincere condolences to his family & his many friends & associates.
