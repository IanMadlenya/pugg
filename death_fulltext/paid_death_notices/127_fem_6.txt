        LADENBURG - Veronica. The Board of Trustees, friends, and former colleagues note with sadness the loss of Hedi Ladenburg, who died on July 25th at the age of 80. Hedi taught at the Fieldston Lower School for twenty-six years. Although she retired in 1985, her connection with the school never ended. Written for teachers, her classic book ''The Living Past in a Modern Classroom'' details the methods and underlying philosophy of her work. Generations of children were touched by her deeply insightful teaching. Hedi's warmth and gentle spirit will be missed. A memorial service will be held on September 20th at 2:00 in the Student/Faculty Center of the Fieldston School. Sara E. Nathan and S. Donald Sussman Frederick C.
