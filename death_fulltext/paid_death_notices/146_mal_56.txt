        MINTZ-Ira, M.D. The Officers and Members of the Psychoanalytic Association of New York mourn the death of their esteemed member and colleague, Ira Mintz. A ground-breaking pioneer in the field of psychosomatic medicine, he authored numerous original papers and co-edited three outstanding books including what has become a classic work on anorexia nervosa and bulimia. His brilliant scholarship and patient understanding will be deeply missed. We express our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Nancy, his children, Karen, Susan and Robert, and his grandchildren.
