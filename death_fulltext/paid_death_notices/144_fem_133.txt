        HALPERN-Gertrude., age 85, medical editor and journalist, former Managing Editor of Hospital Practice Magazine, died at her Manhattan home after a brief illness. She was a 1934 graduate of Barnard College, (Phi Beta Kappa, English honors) and was editor of the Barnard College newspaper. During the Second World War she worked at Life Magazine, organizing photographic surveys of the country's wartime experiences and covering the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt. After the war she produced the American Heart Association's annual report for many years. She was known for piercing intelligence, combined with unfailing grace and sweetness. Her husband of fifty-one years, Milton Halpern, died last year. The warmth of their home will be missed by many. One daughter and son-on-law, two brothers, a sister and a grandson survive her.
