        SHRUT-George. It is with profound sorrow that we mark the passing of our beloved friend, Mr. George Shrut. He was a giant among men and a righteous man in his generation. His love for BenGurion University, for the Jewish people and for the State of Israel never waivered. It was only last week at the Board that we presented him, in his absence, with a Life Achievement award. Dear George was a unique and singular leader of our people and we express our sorrow to his dear companion Milada and to his children Howard and Marjorie. Professor Avishay Braverman President, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev Lord George Weidenfeld Chairman, Board of Governors Ben-Gurion University of the Negev
