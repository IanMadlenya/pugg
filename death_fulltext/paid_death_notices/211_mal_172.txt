        WASHER--Rabbi Judah. Yeshiva University mourns the passing of a devoted alumnus and friend of YU for 72 years. A member of Yeshiva College's first graduating class in 1932, Rabbi Washer was ordained at our affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary and served as rabbi of The Jewish Center of Teaneck for 29 years and as president of the New York Board of Rabbis. He and his children endowed a scholarship at Stern College for Women in memory of their late wife and mother, Rabbanit Helyne Washer. Heartfelt condolences to the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel, President Norman Lamm, Chancellor Ronald P. Stanton, Chairman Board of Trustees
