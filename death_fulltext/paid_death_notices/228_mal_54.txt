        DI GIUSEPPE--Enrico. New York City Opera mourns the passing of our good friend and colleague, Enrico Di Giuseppe, a leading tenor with our company for twenty years. From his 1963 debut as Michele in ''The Saint of Bleecker Street'' he provided us with many memorable evenings in the theater. From the classic tenor roles of Rodolfo and Alfredo, to Donizetti's ''Queen'' Trilogy, to Albert Gregor in ''The Makropolous Affair'', the range of his artistry and his passionate performances will long be remembered and treasured. More recently, as a a vocal coach at The Juilliard School and elsewhere, he offered training and encouragement to the next generation of singers. His artistry and warm collegial spirit will be missed. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife Lorna, and his son Ricky, and to his many friends. Paul Kellogg General Director
