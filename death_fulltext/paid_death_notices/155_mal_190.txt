        CADMUS-Paul. Age 94. Artist. Born NYC 1904. Died peacefully at his home in Weston, CT. on December 12, 1999. Beloved companion of Jon Anderson for the past 35 years. Dear brother of Fidelma Cadmus Kirstein and brother-inlaw of Lincoln Kirstein, both deceased. Paul Cadmus was an elegant, dignified man who was an inspiration to all who knew him. An artist of great talent and integrity, he remained true to his unique, creative vision for 70 years. His support and encouragement of younger artists and his interest in their work was only one example of his great generosity and vitality. Those of us who knew him well and who worked with him over the years have always known that we were truly privileged. We treasure and honor our memories of his love and friendship. He will be greatly missed. Bridget Moore, Edward De Luca and the staff of DC Moore Gallery
        CADMUS-Paul. Master painter and draftsman, he was always simply himself, and that self, like his art, was beautiful. For this he was loved and looked up to by many, including many young artists and his friends at the Estate Project for Artists with AIDS. Randall Bourscheidt President, Alliance for the Arts
