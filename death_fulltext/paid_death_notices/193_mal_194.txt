        CRAIG - George M., 87. Passed away peacefully Sunday, February 9 at his home in Cambridge, NY from renal failure. Originally from Elmhurst, Queens, he moved upstate to live with his godson John Carlson and family. He leaves no surviving blood relatives, but many friends and chosen family who love and cherish him. Retired from his work at the Port Authority, he had a life-long love affair with trains. His dedication to children and disabled veterans led him to support many organizations and charities. A student of Lincoln and the Civil War, he was three times President of the NY Civil War Roundtable and the recipient of the prestigious Barondess/ Lincoln Award. He raised funds to restore Grant's Tomb and General George Thomas' gravesite in Troy, NY, as well as founded the Thomas/Longstreet Trust at the Chickamauga National Military Park in GA. At the time of his death he was making a documentary on Thomas' life, who was his hero. Both Thomas and Craig possessed many of the same qualities; quiet, unassuming and brave men, both dedicated to their sense of duty. His remains were cremated privately. There will be a Memorial service at the 7th Regiment Armory at 66th and Park Ave, 4th floor, NYC, Wednesday February 19 68pm. In lieu of flowers you can make a gift in his name to one of his causes: St. John's Home for Boys, 50 Beach 110 St, Rockaway NY, 11694, or General Films, 1 Washington St, Cambridge NY, 12816 (to support the completion of the Thomas documentary).
