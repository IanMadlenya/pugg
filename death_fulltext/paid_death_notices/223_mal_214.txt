        PODELL--Bertram. My dearly beloved Bert, It's been so many years, I don't know where to begin. No one ever had a better life. I will always cherish the fabulous times we had. Our accomplishments together. Our creation of our 3 wonderful children. Fiftytwo years. We had so much fun together, and a life beyond my wildest dreams. In the end you suffered so very much. Your courage and strength pulled us all through. I will love you forever and ever. Bunny
