        $(6$)LEVENTHAL -- Harold. We send our heartfelt condolences to his wife Natalie and family on the passing of this icon of Musical Americana. The Weavers, Woody & Arlo Guthrie, Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan, Judy Collins and so many others benefited from his commitment and counsel. And America benefited from his brave stand for unfettered expression. From the nightmare years of the McCarthy era to whenever freedom was threatened, Harold fought the good fight. For 36 years he was our client and friend-and wasn't that a time. Erwin, Ellen, Saul and Gideon Erwin Frankel Productions
