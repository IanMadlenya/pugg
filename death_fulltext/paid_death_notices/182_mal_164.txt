        ATKINSON-Clinton J. 74, died suddenly on March 4, in his summer home in Craryville, NY. He was in high spirits-and then he left us, a good death for him, difficult for family and friends. Clint was a professional theater director, at Long Island Stage and many other theaters, the latest, New York State Theater in Albany. He taught drama at Vassar, Wesleyan, SUNY Albany. He was born and raised in the Canal Zone, Panama, educated at William and Mary, and Yale, and was a lieutenant in the Korean War. His beloved family-wife Lois, sons Matthew and Seth, daughters-in-law Wendy and Oak, grandsons Blake and Kirk-feel blessed by having had this unique man and mind in their lives, a bibliophile, host, jam maker, mensch. A memorial service in NYC will be announced later. Donations would be appreciated to Southern Poverty Law Center, 400 Washington Ave, PO Box 56322, Montgomery, AL 36177-7459.
