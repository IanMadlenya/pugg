        MILLER-Howard. The entire Sage family mourns the passing of Howard Miller, a devoted partner to Lillian Sage for 20 years and a caring friend to the families of Ann, Malcolm and Martin. His warmth, honesty and broad smile will be deeply missed. Howard shared his zest for life with us with a keen intelligence and infinite good nature. Howard filled our home-his homewith joy and love. Services today, 10:45 AM, at Plaza Jewish Community Chapel, 91st and Amsterdam, NYC.
