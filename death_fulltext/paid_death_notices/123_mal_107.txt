After joining the City Opera in 1990 he sang in many of our productions, including several major premieres. He became a valued member of the company and a good friend. We'll miss his enthusiasm, his support and his friendship. Our deepest sympathies go to his family, his colleagues and to his many friends throughout the Country. Paul Kellogg General Director
