        AVEDON--Richard. His profound creativity and humanity will long be remembered by those who thrilled to the experience of his two retrospectives at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1978 and 2002. Through his extraordinary donation of portrait photographs he will teach future generations of visitors to the Museum to read the souls in his faces of the twentieth century. In addition to his probing and pioneering vision, Avedon's personal charm, energy, and brilliance will be deeply missed by all those who had the privilege of working with him.
