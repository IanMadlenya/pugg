        ROBBINS--Richard D., M.D., F.A.C.S., Colo-rectal surgeon, died May 31, at home in his bed after a valiant eightmonth battle with pancreatic cancer. Graduate of Harvard and Bellevue/NYU. He retired from practice at Lenox Hill Hospital in '98 to return to an early passion--writing. He published over 70 short stories and was nominated for a PushCart Prize among others. An irreverent service will be held June 4, at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Ave. at 81 St, 5:30 PM. Dick leaves his beloved wife Carrie, brother Jim, niece Nancy, nephew David, niece-in-law Kristen, two collies and a smelly cat. Any donations may be made to the Animal Medical Center, 510 East 62 St., in Dr. Robbins' name.
