        MORITA-Akio. The Staff and Trustees of The Museum of Modern Art are deeply saddened by the passing of Akio Morita, a long time friend and supporter of the Museum. With his wife Yoshiko, a Trustee of the Museum, his interest and generosity were far reaching. To Mrs. Morita and other members of the family, we send our profound sympathy. David Rockefeller, Chairman Emeritus Ronald S. Lauder, Chairman Agnes Gund, President Glenn D. Lowry, Director The Museum of Modern Art, NY
