        WALLACH-Rolf. 89, of Sherman, CT. Loyal husband of Violet, devoted brother of Lotte Hanf, Annelise Rosenberg, and Fred Wallace, affectionate uncle of six nieces and nephews, benign and generous friend of Pixie, Ursula, Lillian, Tony and scores of others. His life was rich in unassuming heroism. Because of his foresight and clear thinking, he was able to rescue parents, siblings, aunts and uncles who were trapped in Munich on the eve of the Holocaust. Thank you, Rolf, and rest in peace. Donations in his name may be made to the New Milford Visiting Nurse Hospice, 68 Park Lane Road New Milford, Ct. 06776.
