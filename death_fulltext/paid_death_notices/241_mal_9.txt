        DRINAN--Robert. The American Civil Liberties Union mourns the passing of steadfast civil liberties supporter, Father Robert Frederick Drinan. A five-term member of the House of Representatives, Drinan's firm belief in religious liberty led him to become an unlikely opponent of constitutional amendments banning abortion and allowing prayer in public schools. Drinan was honored with the ACLU of Massachusetts' Abraham T. Alper Award in 1975, and served as the vice chair of the ACLU's National Advisory Council. Father Drinan will be deeply missed by all who treasure individual rights.
