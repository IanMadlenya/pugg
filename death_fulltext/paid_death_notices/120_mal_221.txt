        FRIEDMAN-Samuel J. The Board of Directors, volunteers and staff deeply mourn the loss of a loyal supporter and dedicated leader. Through his 20 year association with The American Red Cross in Westchester County he championed the principles of The Red Cross, served on the nominating planned giving and financial development committees and as legal counsel. As chairman of the board the last 3 years he diligently led the Westchester County Chapter to the threshold of its hundredth anniversary. Sincere condolences are extended to his wife Doris, daughters and grandchildren. We will deeply miss his guiding presence and friendship.
