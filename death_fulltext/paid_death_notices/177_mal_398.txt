        VICTOR-Mac (January 14, 1918October 14, 2000). Retired executive, World War II veteran and Bronze Star recipient. As we observe the anniversary of his death, we reflect on the celebration that was his life. Over his 82 years he perfected joy, love, and laughter. He was a tap dancer and choreographer, baseball player, jeweler, airplane mechanic, war hero, automobile mechanic, executive, lobbyist, magician, singer, comedian, arbitrator, husband, father, grandfather, golfer, protector, caregiver, and friend. He was a member of Leewood Country Club, executive director of the Metropolitan Parking Association of New York, and, before that, the New York State Gasoline Retailers Association. He was a hero to his nephews and nieces, a role model to his children, a buddy to his grandchildren. His love of life, his good humor, optimism, hearty laugh, and graceful dance steps will be missed. He was predeceased by his wife, Sylvia. He is survived by his daughters, Frances Scheffler and Beverly Nathan, sons-in-law, Allan Scheffler and Gerald Nathan, grandchildren, Eric, Karen, Jill, Elizabeth & Rachel
