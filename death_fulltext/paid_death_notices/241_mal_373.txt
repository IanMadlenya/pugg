        BERGGRUEN--Heinz. The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn the loss of Heinz Berggruen, one of the world's leading art dealers and collectors of modern art, who was a long-time Benefactor and friend. In 1984, he donated to the Metropolitan his superb collection of 90 paintings and drawings by Paul Klee, which illustrates all aspects of the artist's career as painter and draughtsman, and which in breadth and depth was -and remains --unsurpassed by any other private holdings of Klee's art. The entire collection was displayed in a major exhibition here in 1988, and has been on view subsequently in thematic rotations. Over a long and active career spanning more than six decades, Heinz Berggruen demonstrated an astounding level of discernment and a seemingly infallible eye for quality, understanding the essence of each of the artists on which he focused his collecting. Through his wonderful gift to the Metropolitan and to all of its visitors, the examples of his level of connoisseurship and his passion for art will reside here, along with his most generous donation, in perpetuity. We extend condolences to his wife Bettina, his children John, Helen, Nicolas, and Olivier, and to the entire family. James R. Houghton, Chrman Philippe de Montebello, Dir Emily K. Rafferty, President
