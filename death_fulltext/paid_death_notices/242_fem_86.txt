        KANTOR--Margaretha Clara Smulders, age 81, died on March 6, 2007. Born and raised in Indonesia of Dutch parents, Lily and Bernardus Smulders. She survived four years in a Japanese internment camp during WWII, where her strength of character and striking looks earned her the nickname, ''The White Angel'' which to this day she is known by among the survivors who gather each year in Amsterdam, a reunion she helped organize. After the war she became a KLM airline stewardess and eventually the spokes-model for KLM during the ''glory days'' of flying and favorite model of the late Dutch photographer Paul Huff. Emigrated to New York in 1960, she met and married Norman Kantor in 1965, her devoted husband of 42 years. One of her great passions was tennis which despite a debilitating kidney disease that plagued her for the last 10 years, she played with ferocity, especially at net, with people half her age right up until her last week. Another great passion was the New York Times, who may have lost its most devoted reader of the last 30 years. As someone who was unable to get a higher education because of her circumstances during the war, she managed to educate herself well beyond many grad students, by her almost religious devotion to this newspaper. She read it cover to cover everyday, including Sundays and shared what she learned with all by mailing dozens of New York Times clippings each week to her friends and family. She even had two Letters-to-the-Editor published. She is survived by Norman, her two children, Steven Kantor and Clarissa Taylor, and her four grandchildren, who she adored, Chloe, Caroline, Ben and Jack. She was one of those rare people who saw beauty in everything around her, especially in nature, and helped foster that love and appreciation in her children and grandchildren. Known to her friends and family as Toetie, she will be deeply missed by all. We love you, Mom.
