        GAMPEL--Harry A. The Yeshiva University family expresses profound sorrow upon the passing of an outstanding humanitarian, Jewish communal leader, and philanthropist. Mr. Gampel served as a member of the Board of Directors and, more recently, honorary director of our Sy Syms School of Business. With his beloved wife, Edith, he endowed the Mr. and Mrs. Harry A. Gampel Communications Center in the Schottenstein Center on our Wilf Campus, and, in recognition of his leadership, he received an honorary doctoral degree from YU in 1989. Our heartfelt condolences to Edith; daughters Margo (and Richard) Absher, Cheryl Gampel Shapiro, Debra (and Bruce) Fischman, and Linda Kornblum; seven grandchildren; and sisters, Marcia Schimmel and Estelle Cushner. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel, President Dr. Norman Lamm Chancellor Ronald P. Stanton, Chairman Board of Trustees Bernard L.
