        LOEB-Henry A. Mr. Loeb was elected in 1955 to replace his father, Carl M. Loeb, on the Board of Valeria Home, later renamed, in 1975, as The Jacob and Valeria Langeloth Foundation. He took his duties as a Director with high seriousness. Always punctual, perspicacious and perceptive, he brought to our deliberations his wisdom laced with good humor. As Treasurer since 1959, he shared his broad experience in financial markets and surveyed and supervised our fiscal affairs with skills which will be difficult to emulate. The Directors of the Langeloth Foundation extend their collective sympathy to Mrs. Loeb and their children. John L. Loeb, Jr, Chairman George Labalme, Jr., President Adam Hochschild, Vice President Peter K. Loeb, Treasurer
