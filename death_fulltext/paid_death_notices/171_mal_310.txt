        PECK-Ruby (Rubin Peckolick). To our dear grandfather Ruby: We were your boys and you guided us. You taught us honor. You instilled ethics. You preached family. You believed in us and you allowed us to chase our dreams. You taught us to reach higher, to think positive while keeping our right hand up. You made us men and we'll carry your spirit with every breath. We love you Grandpa, and we'll make you proud. Todd and Adam Harrison R.P.
