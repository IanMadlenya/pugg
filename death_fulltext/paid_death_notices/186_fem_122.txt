        CAHOON-Judith A. To have known her is to be enriched with the joys of life. Judy Cahoon, of Chappaqua, NY, died at home at the age of 58 on July 17, 2002. Judy was the beloved wife of Will Cahoon. She was born May 20, 1944, in Mineola, NY, to the late Marion and Ed Wunneke. A creative designer and writer, Judy had a long and successful career with Wunderman, Ricotta & Kline/Young & Rubicon and Reinke Graphics. A devoted wife, daughter, mother, grandmother and friend to many, we will miss her dearly. She is survived by her loving husband, Will Cahoon, and his five children; sister, Joan Weigand; one niece, and six grandsons. A memorial service will be held at a later date. Donations may be sent to Hospice Care of Westchester and Putnam.
