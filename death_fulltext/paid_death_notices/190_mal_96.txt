        WAGNER - Gary. Beloved husband of Ilsa; loving brother of Myra Sawikin; devoted uncle of Harvey Sawikin and Judy Fein. He died as he lived, with dignity. Born in Germany, he prospered after WWII in America as a pioneer of the TV industry and founder of Wagner International Photos, a leader in its field for 50 years. More recently, he was the host and writer of ''Alternative Medicine'' and ''The Jewish Entertainment Hour,'' a popular TV and radio program that gave performers from around the world, especially Israel and Russia, the chance to reach an audience in the US. A member of the Friar's Club, he loved to joke and laugh, even in the final stages of his illness. He was loved and respected and he will be deeply missed. Funeral services are being held at the Riverside Memorial Chapel.
