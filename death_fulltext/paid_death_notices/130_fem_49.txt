        CONRAD-Lucille (aka Lola Ross). Judith Malina and the Living Theatre Company share with the family of our dear friend and lifelong colleague Lola Ross as Lucille Conrad was known in the Theatre, our sorrow at the news of her passing. Lola was part of the Living Theatre community from its very beginning in the 1940s and she continued to contribute her art and her energy to our work even to this day. We remember her with love and gratitude and we already miss her.
