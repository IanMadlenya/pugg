        WEINER-Phyllis. On behalf of the attending medical staff and affiliate psychology staff of the Department of Psychiatry and the entire Lenox Hill Hospital community, we extend our deepest condolences to our esteemed and longtime colleague, Dr. Howard Weiner, and his family on the loss of their dearest Phyllis. Phyllis Weiner was a caring and elegant woman whom we had the privilege of knowing for over 25 years. Her incisive intellect, subtle sense of humor and engaging manner were constantly refreshing and energizing. We will miss her greatly and hope we can provide some comfort to our friend Howard who has lost his soul mate. Allen H. Collins, MD, MPH Director, Department of Psychiatry President of the Medical Board Lenox Hill Hospital
