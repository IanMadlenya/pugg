        LINOWITZ--Sol M. Cornell University mourns the loss of devoted alumnus, trustee emeritus, and presidential councillor, Sol M. Linowitz. His ground-breaking business leadership, unwavering commitment to public service, and ardent dedication to Cornell will long be remembered. In 1938 Sol Linowitz received his J.D. from Cornell Law School, graduating first in his class. In 1966 he was appointed to the Cornell Board of Trustees by New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller serving until 1995. In 1996 he was named Presidential Councillor by Cornell President Hunter Rawlings. In 1998 the University was proud to see Sol Linowitz receive the nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, from President Clinton. Sol Linowitz's wife and two of his four children are Cornell alumnae, punctuating a great man's indelible mark on the University. He will be missed by the entire Cornell community. We express our sincere condolences to his wife Evelyn Zimmerman Linowitz '39 and daughters Anne Linowitz Mozersky '65, Ronni Linowitz Jolles '78, Jan Linowitz Wadden and June Linowitz Eisner. Peter Meinig, Chairman Board of Trustees Jeffrey S. Lehman, President Cornell University
        LINOWITZ--Ambassador Sol M. The Trustees, President and the entire Hamilton College community mourn the loss of one of America's great statesmen, who advised several U.S. presidents, including Jimmy Carter, for whom he served as co-negotiator of the Panama Canal Treaties, and representative for Middle East negotiations from 1979 to 1981, and on whom President Clinton bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1998. We are thankful for his many years of service to his alma mater as a member of the Board of Trustees, and we extend our heartfelt sympathy to his wife of 65 years, Toni and family, including brother and fellow Hamilton graduate, Robert Linowes.
