        CAMPBELL--Charles J. Dr. Campbell served with distinction as a faculty member and clinician at Columbia University Medical Center from 1957 until retiring in 1987. His dedication to eye care and to technological developments that advanced the field provides a legacy that benefits patients to this day. He chaired our Department of Ophthalmology from 1974 until retiring as Harkness Professor Emeritus of Ophthalmology. Chief among his accomplishments was the development of optical diagnostic and treatment tools that spared patients from invasive surgery on the eye. We offer our condolences to Dr. Campbell's family. Lee Goldman, M.D. Executive Vice President for Health and Biomedical Sciences and Dean of the Faculties of Health Sciences and Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center
