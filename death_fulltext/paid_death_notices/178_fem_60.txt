        BERGER-Barbara. To my one and only. You were always there for advice, a pep talk, a shoulder to cry on. We shared secrets. You understood my fears. We shared life's joys and sorrows and ordinary moments. You believed in me even when I gave up on myself. That's the kind of friend you were to me. You were the wind beneath my wings. Love Always, Your One and Only
        BERGER-Barbara. My dear friend for 38 years. I treasure my memories of the times we shared together. You'll always be in my heart. Sorry I could not be with you at the end. Love, Joyce, Bob and Kendra
        BERGER-Barbara. Our heartfelt condolences to Leonard, Dina and Lauren on the passing of their beloved wife and mother. Barbara was a good friend to all. She will be truly missed. Goldstein & Schechter families
