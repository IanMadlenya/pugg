        PERSHAN-Dinah. The Covenant Foundation mourns the passing of Dinah Pershan on February 17, 1997. Beloved grandmother of our esteemed Board member Dr. Betsy Dolgin Katz, Dinah Pershan was born in Krutya, Russia on November 11, 1892 to Asna Dubov and Israel Aaron Shulman. She came to the United States in 1909, and dedicated her 104 years to raising and caring for five generations of children-four children, ten grandchildren, twenty-one great-grandchildren, and two great-great-grandchildren. May those who mourn find comfort among the other mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Judith Ginsberg Executive Director Eli N. Evans Chairman of the Board
