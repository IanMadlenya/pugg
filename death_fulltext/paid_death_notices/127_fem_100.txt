        McDOWELL-Margaret Holmes. Died peacefully in her home on August 14, 1997, after a brief illness. Beloved mother of Catherine Brooks, Maura Kealey, and John and Ann McDowell. Formerly a senior lawyer in the Civil Division of the New York Legal Aid Society and recently of counsel with the Family Law Center, she was a conscientious and imaginative lawyer who championed the legal rights of the poor. She believed that every human being deserves a fair hearing in the courts of law. In fighting for the indigent, immigrants, workers, and women, she sought to create a more just society. Margaret, known to her many friends and colleagues as Peggy, set a high standard of professional and human involvement. Memorial service will follow. A gift in her memory may be made to the Blue Mountain Clinic, 610 N. California St, Missoula, MT 59802.
