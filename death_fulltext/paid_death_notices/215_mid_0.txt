        HAZAN--Mildred. We share the sorrow of our esteemed partner, Scott L. Hazan, on the passing of his mother. Mildred Hazan fought her extended illness with a strong will to live, with dignity and with the support of her entire family. Our thoughts and sympathies are with Scott and his wife, Lorraine, Scott's brother, Craig, and his wife, Betty, and Scott's sister, Pat, and her husband, Bart Tessler. We also extend our condolences to Mildred's grandchildren, Jeremy, Alissa, Jessica and her husband, Sam, and great-grandson, Avi, Marisa and her husband, Chris, Alex and Jordan. Otterbourg, Steindler, Houston and Rosen, P.C.
