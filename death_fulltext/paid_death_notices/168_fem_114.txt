        FUNDORA-Aida. Born July 4, 1919 in Cuba, died January 11, 2001 in Florida. Beloved mother of my wife Luly Duke of East Hampton, NY. Aida's loving family and friends join me in prayer for her eternal peace. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions to Fundacion Amistad, P.O. Box 177, East Hampton, New York 11937, would be appreciated. Anthony Drexel Duke
