        PLEHN-Richard A. We respectfully offer our most sincere condolences to the family and close friends of Richard, whom we fortuitously knew for more than four decades. We sincerely believe that many of the unique qualities of this highly successful and generous person have been indelibly passed on to his children and will live on through them.
