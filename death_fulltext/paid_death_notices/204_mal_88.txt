        POPPER--William I. On December 27, in Santa Barbara, California, at the age of 86. Devoted husband to Maggie, beloved father of Marjorie and Michael, and caring grandfather of Ben, Naomi, Lydia and Adrian. Bill was an active attorney with his own practice for over 50 years. Military service during WWII included O.S.S. assignments in the China theater. A longtime Westchester resident, Bill cherished the company of his Briarcliff friends. He was a reader, piano player and choral singer; and always a faithful Democrat! An Eagle scout, exchange student to China and Harvard graduate, Bill enjoyed tennis, skiing, swimming and golf. Donations in his memory to the Interfaith Council for Action, Ossining, NY, are welcomed.
