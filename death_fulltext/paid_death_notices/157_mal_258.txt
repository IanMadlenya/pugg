        SULAM-Gabriel. The trustees and staff of the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services are saddened to note the passing of Gabriel Sulam, the father of Carol Zicklin, a trustee of JBFCS and founder of our Carol Zicklin LINKS Program. A loving husband, father, grandfather and great grandfather, Mr. Sulam worked hard to provide for his family and, until recently, owned a candy store in the Wall Street area. He belonged to the Sephardic Brotherhood and the Sun Ray Boys, a fraternal organization whose members were all born in Salonika, Greece, as Mr. Salam was in 1909. We extend our deepest sympathies to Mrs. Zicklin, Mr. Sulam's son, Donald, his four grandchildren and his five great grandchildren. Joseph S. Kaplan, President Alan B. Siskind, Ph.D., Executive Vice President Paul Levine, CSW, Associate Executive Vice President Pinchas Berger, CSW, Director, Jewish Connections Programs
