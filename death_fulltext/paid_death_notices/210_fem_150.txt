        LAFRIEDA--Lisa. B.R. Guest Restaurants, Inc. deeply regrets the passing of Lisa LaFrieda. She played an active role in the development of the Meatpacking District, holding a position on Community Board 2. She was generous to all and always willing to lend a hand. We extend our deepest sympathies to her nephew, Pat LaFrieda, and the rest of her family.
