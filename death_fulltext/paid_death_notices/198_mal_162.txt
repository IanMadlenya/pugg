        LILIEN--Herbert, 77, on June 28, 2003 at home. A fixture for sixty years in the Greenwich Village/Soho area as the proprietor of Lilien Hardware, he was affectionately known as the ''Mayor of Greenwich Village.'' A devoted husband to wife Shirley for 54 years and loving father to daughter Carla, his stories and sense of humor will be missed by all who knew him. >>AD#
