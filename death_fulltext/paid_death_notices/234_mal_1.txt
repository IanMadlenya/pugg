        DRETZIN--David.The law yers and staff of Kauff McClain & McGuire LLP join his wife Joanna and daughters Rachel and Julie and their families in mourning the untimely death of David (Duff) Dretzin, our former partner, constant friend and dedicated mentor who died on June 26 from injuries sustained in an automobile accident. Duff founded Dretzin & Kauff, our firm's predecessor, with Jerry Kauff in 1972 and helped nurture and build the firm until his retirement in 1988. He remained active after his retirement, representing indigent defendants in death row cases and performing other pro bono work. Duff was a charming, intelligent, righteous and elegant man. He will be sorely missed.
