        ZELLER-Belle. The Professional Staff Congress mourns the passing of our founding President Emeritus Professor Belle Zeller. Prof. Zeller was not only an outstanding leader of the faculty but she was also an unrelenting advocate for The City University of New York. Dr. Zeller established a national reputation for our union and for our University. Even though she was retired as a Professor of Political Science at Brooklyn College for more than twenty-five years, she still actively participated in affairs that affected The City University of New York. We will deeply miss her. Irwin H. Polishook, President Professional Staff Congress City University of New York
