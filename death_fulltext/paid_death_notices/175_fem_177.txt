        ALKIN-Frances. The Board of Trustees, the Medical Staff, and the employees of Long Beach Medical Center join the members of the Long Beach Medical Center Auxiliary in expressing our profound sorrow on the passing of our colleague, Frances Alkin. For 25 years, she held the office of President of the Medical Center's Auxiliary and was a member of the Board of Trustees for almost 30 years. Her effectiveness, both as a Board member and Auxiliary officer, was unequalled in fundraising efforts and promoting good will within the communities we serve. We extend our deepest sympathy to her children, Sondra and Burt Lesser, grandchildren Michele and Steve Goldman and Cindy and William Lesser, and great-grandchildren John and Evan Lesser. Alfred Osterland Chairman of the Board Bernard Kennedy President, Board of Trustees Richard Goodman, M.D. Chairman, Medical Staff Douglas L.
