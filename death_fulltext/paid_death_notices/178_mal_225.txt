        PUSEY-Nathan. The Board and staff of the Neighborhood Coalition for Shelter recall Nathan Pusey with great fondness. His support for providing housing and mental health services helped make it possible for NCS to help thousands of people find a way home. We extend our sincere sympathies to his dear wife Anne, former member of the NCS Board of Directors, and his entire family.
