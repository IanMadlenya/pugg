        CAMPBELL-Lawrence. The Art Students League of New York marks the passing of Lawrence Campbell, artist, author, noted art critic, and the League's Dedicated Director of Publications and Archives for many years. We appreciate his significant contribution to the literary and intellectual life of the League. He will be missed.
