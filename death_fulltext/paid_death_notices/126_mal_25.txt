We extend heartfelt condolences to the Marcos Katzes, as well as to grandchildren, Dr. Zvi and Rachel Katz, Sara (and Rabbi Tanchum Gershon) Portnoy, Ariela (and Ahron) Guggenheim, and Dr. Raquel Katz; great-grandchildren, and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University David S.
