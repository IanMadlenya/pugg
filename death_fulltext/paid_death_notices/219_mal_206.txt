        KENNEDY--Richard T.P. The staff and volunteers of Thirteen/WNET New York mourn the loss and celebrate the life of our beloved friend and colleague, Richard T.P. Kennedy, a well-respected producer with Thirteen's on-air production department. His devotion to excellence and commitment to the performing arts was an inspiration to us all, especially in his creation of Cabaret Thirteen. Our heartfelt condolences are with his family and friends, and we join them in remembering a truly unique man whose passion for show business and our City was legendary. As he himself would have said, ''Shine on, star.''
