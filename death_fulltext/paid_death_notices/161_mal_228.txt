        SILBERMINTZ-Seymour. K'hal Adath Jeshurun mourns the passing of our Choir's Musical Director. For nearly 40 years his enormous talent, immense patience with amateurs and his ready smile, coupled with an abundance of grace and humility, endeared him to three generations of choir members and concertgoers. The notation ''Arr. SS'' on so much of our music leaves an indelible mark on the liturgy of our Shul. May the Almighty comfort his wife Elaine, their daughters and his brother Teddy amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yehi Zichro Boruch. Zachariah Gelley, Rav Dr. Erich Erlbach, President Samson R. Bechhofer, Conductor A.J. Gutmann, Conductor (Ret.)
