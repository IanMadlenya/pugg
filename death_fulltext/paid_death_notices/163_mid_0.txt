        SHAW-Rosamond Grenfell. The Board of Directors of The Grenfell Association of America extend heartfelt condolences on the death of their beloved mother and grandmother. To Mrs. Shaw's surviving three children, Richard Shaw, Anne Benditt and Susan Phillips, and her four surviving grandchildren, David, Christie, Laura, and Richard. Mrs. Shaw was a dear friend and long-time supporter of The Association. She was the last surviving child of Sir Wilfred T. Grenfell, who was knighted by King George for his legendary medical, missionary, and philanthropic contributions to the people of Labrador and Newfoundland. The Association was founded to perpetuate and support Sir Grenfell's work and Mrs. Shaw will be deeply missed by all its Members.
