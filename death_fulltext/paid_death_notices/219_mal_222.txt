        BRAENDEL--Felix W. 92, died on April 15, 2005. He was born on June 9, 1912, in Palisades Park, NJ. A graduate of Stevens Institute of Technology in 1934, he was chief mechanical engineer and then President of GroovPin Corporation (located at that time in Ridgefield Park, NJ) for most of his working life. He designed, patented, and oversaw the production of vital small machine parts used in both peacetime and in jeeps, tanks, and airplanes during World War II. As chief engineer he was often found, shirtsleeves rolled up, adjusting and repairing machines on the shop floor, machines that he had custom designed. The men on the floor, all of whom he knew, liked him for that. As President he was cut off from the workshop, which pained him, as did negotiations with the union. The prestige and increased salary were only partial compensation for what he had relinquished. At 65 he captained the last of several cabin cruisers down the Atlantic Inland Waterway to a pleasant retirement in Florida with his wife, Tullia, who survives him. Their marriage thrived for 66 years. He is also survived by a younger brother, Arthur; his two children, Fips and Meryl; three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. A kind man of decisive character, he is remembered with respect and fondness by everyone who knew him.
