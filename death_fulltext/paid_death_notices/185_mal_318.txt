        CHARGAFF-Erwin. The faculty, students and staff of Columbia University mourn the loss of our esteemed colleague, teacher and friend Erwin Chargaff. Dr. Chargaff joined the faculty of Columbia University in 1935 and was named professor of biochemistry in 1952. He was a central figure in the history of biochemistry, particularly in contributing to our knowledge of DNA. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and winner of numerous prestigious awards including the 1974 National Medal of Science, the nation's highest award for achievement in science, mathematics and engineering. We extend our deepest condolences to his family and friends. He will be greatly missed.
