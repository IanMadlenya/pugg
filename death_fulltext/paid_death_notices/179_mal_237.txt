        SEBALD-W.G. The 92nd Street Y Board and staff mourn the passing of novelist W.G. Sebald. On October 15, 2001, Sebald graced the stage of the Unterberg Poetry Center, reading from his novel, ''Austerlitz''. The Y honors Sebald's stylistic bravery and depictions of life in the aftermath of World War II and the Holocaust. His death is a blow to literature, but his work is a gift. We send our thoughts and prayers to his family. Matthew Bronfman, President Philip L. Milstein, Chairman Sol Adler, Executive Director, 92nd Street Y Hanna Arie-Gaifman, Director, 92nd Street Y, Tisch Center for the Arts David Yezzi, Director, 92nd Street Y, Unterberg Poetry Center
