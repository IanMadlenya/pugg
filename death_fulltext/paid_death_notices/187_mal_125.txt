        WAXMAN-Rabbi Mordecai. Temple Israel of Great Neck with profound sadness announces the passing of its beloved senior Rabbi, Mordecai Waxman. Rabbi Waxman served the Congregation for the past 55 years with distinction and influenced the lives of generations of people. He was also a major world figure in Conservative Judaism, and was particularly noted for his historical accomplishments in interfaith relations. Most important, he was a warm, welcoming figure who every member of the congregation and colleague, past and present, will remember with love and respect. We extend our deepest sympathies to the entire Waxman family. The funeral will take place 10 AM, Tuesday, August 13, Temple Israel of Great Neck, 108 Old Mill Road, Great Neck, NY. Interment will be at Beth Moses Cemetery in Farmingdale, NY. The family asks that contributions in Rabbi Waxman's memory be directed to the ''Ruth and Mordecai Waxman Memorial Fund'' at Temple Israel of Great Neck. Steven Markowitz, President
        WAXMAN-Rabbi Mordecai. We mourn with sorrow the passing of our beloved colleague and past president (1974-1976). Ordained in 1941, he served as a chaplain in WWII and in 1947 he became rabbi of Temple Israel in Great Neck, a position he served with great distinction until his death. Author of Tradition and Change, he also served as editor of Conservative Judaism. He was a pioneer in interfaith work, serving as president of the Synagogue Council of America and as chairman of our Interfaith Committee. We extend our deepest condolences to his sons David, Hillel and our colleague Rabbi Jonathan and sister Naomi Perlman and to all who were touched through his rabbinate. Rabbi Reuven Hammer, Pres Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Exec. VP The Rabbinical Assembly
