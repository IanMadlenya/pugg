        TANNENBAUM--Walter. Surprise Lake Camp mourns the loss of Walter Tannenbaum. He was a member of our Board of Directors for over thirty years and was active on many committees. Walter treasured the children we serve, and he loved our site. He planted gardens at camp, and he and his family built the Tannenbaum Trail. We will miss his warm smile, his booming voice, and the way his eyes teared when the campers sang. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife Hodi, his three daughters, and his grandchildren. $(6$)TANNENBAUM--Walter, 74, passed away peacefully at home on January 30, 2007.
