        LOHR--Ruth. Unforgettable and irreplaceable Ruth. Now reunited with her beloved Steve. For me it was a beautiful gift to have been her friend. Ruth leaves a huge and vast emptiness in my life and surely in the lives of so many of her friends on both sides of the Atlantic. My dear friend, rest in the peace which you so amply deserve. Karin
        LOHR--Ruth, on November 21 after a brief illness. Our family and her many friends mourn the loss of this wonderful lady, whose humor, warmth, wit and vivacious spirit uplifted us all. The Victory family Michael, Annemarie, Elizabeth and Christopher
