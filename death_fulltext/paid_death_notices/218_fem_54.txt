        GOLDENSON--Isabelle. The Board and staff of United Cerebral Palsy of New York City note with great sorrow the passing of our founder and benefactor, Isabelle Goldenson. Isabelle and her late husband, Leonard H. Goldenson, together with Ethel and Jack Hausman, Irving Sloan and other parents, founded UCP/NYC in 1947. It is still the flagship affiliate of a nationwide movement, which they also founded in 1949. Hers is a remarkable legacy. Today, UCP/NYC serves over 11,000 individuals each year, and more than 2400 of them receive year-round ongoing services through 80 adult, children, family support, health care, recreational and residential programs. Isabelle was active in UCP/NYC's Women's Division for nearly 50 years. Her daughter, Loreen Arbus, continues that tradition as a Co-Chair of our Women Who Care Luncheon, which celebrates the accomplishments of women as caregivers, volunteers and professionals. We extend our deepest sympathy to Loreen and her sister Maxine Goldenson, to Isabelle's grandson and her entire family. Martin Hausman, President Edward R. Matthews, Executive Director, Ronald J.H. Napal Chief Development Officer
