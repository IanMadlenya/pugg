        PALM-Marie C. On September 29, 1997, at home in Bedminster, NJ, Marie, age 49, died after a long struggle against cancer. A resident of Summit, N.J., she is survived by her loving husband Greg and daughters Jennifer and Katherine, of NYC and Summit, respectively, as well as her parents Steve and Mary Hambalek of Vestal, N.Y., her siblings Michael (and his wife Patricia) of Seoul, Korea and Fort Meade, MD, Lisa of Albany, N.Y., Steve (and his wife Kiomi) of Tokyo, Japan and Anne Hambalek Lahr of Vestal, her grandmother Lena Every of Chatham, NJ, and her many nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles and cousins. Her sister Catherine died shortly after birth. After graduating from Bryn Mawr College in 1970 with a degree in medieval history, she was a course assistant in the finance department at the Harvard Business School. Marie devoted her life to her family and friends, particularly her daughters of whom she was justifiably proud. All who knew her were enriched by her judgement, intelligence, kindness and patience. For the past decade, Marie was very active in show jumping, along with her daughter Kate, as president of Golden Song farm, and as an officer of the New Jersey Horse Show Association and the New Jersey Professional Horse Show Association. Since graduation from Bryn Mawr, she also has been lovingly devoted to its affairs. Services: Our Lady of Sorrows Church, Vestal (10 AM), October 2. A memorial service will be held at a later date in New Jersey. Donations, in lieu of flowers, may be sent to Bryn Mawr College or the cancer-related charity of your choice.
