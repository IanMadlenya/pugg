        RADEMACHER -- Michael. Michael Rademacher Productions LLC acknowledges the passing of our founder, Michael Rademacher, at the age of 50. Due to legal difficulties which occurred after Michael's death, we are late publishing this notice. Michael leaves behind his wife, Maria, a son, Bryan, who resides in Sydney, Australia and relatives and friends living in Australia, Germany, France, England and the U.S. The Michael Rademacher Charitable Trust has been established to contribute funds to those organizations closest to Michael and Maria's heart. These disbursements will begin after January 1, 2004. Michael's ashes were spread in his beloved Paris. His story and guest book are on www.legacy.com.
