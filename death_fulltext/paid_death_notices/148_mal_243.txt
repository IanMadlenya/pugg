        BASTIS-Christos. The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn the passing of its beloved Honorary Trustee, Christos G. Bastis, whose extraordinary generosity and exquisite taste have enriched the Museum and its collections for more than three decades. A member of the Visiting Committee to the Department of Greek and Roman Art since 1969, he was elected a Fellow for Life, a Fellow in Perpetuity, and a Museum Benefactor. In addition, to the loan of his superb private collection for an unforgettable 1988 exhibition at the Metroplitan, he donated many works of classical art that have become cornerstones of the Greek and Roman collection. His kindness, his love of classical art, and his generous spirit will be greatly missed. James R. Houghton, Chairman Philippe de Montebello, Director
