        KAUFMAN-Stella, Brownie. Darling mother Brownie, whose great concern and devotion always made me feel cared for and loved. Her great beauty, culture, design talent and inner strength gave her a zest for life and a sincere caring for people. She will always be in my thoughts, enormously missed, and have a large portion of my heart. I love you mother. Cheri Kaufman
