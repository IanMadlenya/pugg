        PECK--Stephen M. During the 15 years in which Stephen Peck made his office with us, every one of our 75 people not only knew he was here, but each of us, individually, felt his warmth and friendship. He took the time to show us that he was here to listen, to hear, often to act on behalf of each of us. We don't know of a bigger heart on Wall Street; we feel his loss deeply. Our sad condolences to his gallant and loving wife, Judith, to his children, stepchildren and grandchildren. Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co.
