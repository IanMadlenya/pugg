        TURK-Nathan. In memory of our adored son-in-law and brother-inlaw, Nathan ''Toolie'' Turk, the first Jewish Cowboy from the Lower Eastside, who with our daughter, Gloria, bought an old farm and stable for two horses and with back-breaking work, creative imagination & pioneering fortitude were the sole founders and builders of America's largest guest ranch, The Rocking Horse Ranch of Highland, New York. His inventive mind, great heart and generous spirit passed a wide net of love over his devoted family; his wife, Gloria, his children Steven, Shelley Turk and Suzanne Turk Garcia, his grandchildren, Jack, Daniel, Samantha, Stefanie and Emilia, his sister Eleanor Buxbaum, his sea of friends and his grateful community. For us, he was the brightest star in our family. This is his legacy. We will all miss him. Irving, Libby and Dr. Alan E. Schwartz
