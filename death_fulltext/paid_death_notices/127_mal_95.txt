        GILBERT-Harris. With profound sorrow the Officers, Board and Staff of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations mourn the death of a cherished friend and colleague. An activist and courageous leader, he served our Movement with unique devotion for decades. His care and concern touched virtually every aspect of our work including his chairmanship of two major Commissions of Reform Judaism, Social Action and Outreach. We extend heartfelt condolences to his loving wife, Sally, his children and all his loved ones. Jerome H. Somers, Chairman Rabbi Eric H. Yoffie, President
