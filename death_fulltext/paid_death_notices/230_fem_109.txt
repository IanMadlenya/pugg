        STEEL--Ruth. Of Southampton, New York, died peacefully on March 6, 2006 during her 95th year. Ruth Steel, along with her beloved husband Arthur, who died 11 years earlier, was an active and concerned philanthropist, supporting a broad range of causes ranging from civil justice to museums and medical facilities. Ruth's mother was an opera singer and her adventuresome grandfather a mineral prospector. Her only brother Sheldon died last year. Well-known for her sparkling wit, her ebullient personality, and surprising ability to tell an off-color story with great dignity, she is survived by sons John and Lewis, daughters-in-law Bunny Freidus Steel and Dr. Kitty Muldoon Steel, eight grandchildren, Janine, Brian, Patrick, Eric, Lauren, Eliza, Zachary and Sabrina, and seven great-grandchildren. She will be sorely missed by her family, a devoted circle of friends, and the community in which she lived and served. There will be a memorial service in New York City on March 19th.
