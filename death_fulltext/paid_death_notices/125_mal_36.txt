        WALTNER-Jules G., MD. The Department of Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery at Columbia University, P&S, mourns the passing of Dr. Jules G. Waltner, Professor Emeritus. Dr. Waltner was a pioneer in the study of fluid circulation in the inner ear. He was instrumental in the development of many techniques used in reconstruction of hearing mechanisms of the ear as well as early use of ultrasound to treat Meniere's disease. Many techniques he developed are in standard use today. We honor Dr. Waltner for his many contributions, both professional and philanthropic, and extend our sincere condolences to his family. Lanny Garth Close, MD Professor and Chairman
