        ROTH-Joseph. In memory of our good friend and founding benefactor to the Emanuel Foundation. Just this past year we had the chance to honor for the second time, Mr. Roth whose work as a philanthropist and supporter of Holocaust causes was unparalleled. He will be sorely missed, but his legacy and his many projects will endure for generations to come.
