        GREGORI-Leon. On March 6, 2001. Dearest Dad, this has been the longest year in our lives. Even though you are in our thoughts and hearts 24/7 and every second each day, our sadness is overwhelming. We are so proud of the lessons you have taught us, the knowledge we soaked up from you in many subjects, your adoption of my friends as their ''surrogate father''. Everyone in this town of NYC misses you, respected you, admired you, was thankful for your kindness, gentleness and ability to make us all laugh, a gentleman's gentleman. Dad, your life's work, art and illustrations are all masterpieces and are recognized as such. You truly had ''golden hands''. Mom sends her love, Eva sends her love, you know how much they miss you. As for me, your son Michael, I also send my love and ask for forgiveness that I was not with you hand-in-hand as you started your journey one year ago. I shall never forgive myself. Dad, I love you so very much. Thanks for everything. Your Michael.
