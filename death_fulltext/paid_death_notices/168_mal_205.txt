        HUGHES-Fred. The Board and Staff of The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh expresses profound sympathy to the family of Fred Hughes. As the Founding President of the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts Inc., he envisioned the creation of a unique museum devoted to the life and art of his lifelong friend, Andy Warhol. His spirited tenacity, unwavering good taste, and adroit administrative acumen sustained both the artist he loved and the institution he helped create as well as carried him through his difficult final years. May his family be sustained by the stunning legacy he helped to mold and perpetuate and find on it his mark for history. Thomas Sokolowski, Director The Andy Warhol Museum
