        ROD-James P. The directors and staff of the Hudson River Foundation and the Hudson River Improvement Fund note with deepest sorrow the death of Jim Rod, manager of the Constitution Marsh Sanctuary. We celebrate Jim for his love of, and attention to, the natural world and his particular fervent commitment to understanding and protecting the Hudson River. We extend our sympathy to his family as we share with the entire Hudson River environmental community a feeling of immeasurable loss.
