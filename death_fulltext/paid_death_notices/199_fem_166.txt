        MILLER--Pearl C. Beloved daughter of the late Charles Cohn and Bella Cohen Cohn, adored sister of Seymour Cohn and the late Mildred Cohn, Maurice Cohn, Irene Colvin and Sylvan Lawrence, devoted and loyal wife of the late Henry Miller, and cherished aunt and great-aunt to each and every member of the Cohen and Cembalest families. Born on October 20, 1906 in New York City, the youngest daughter in a large and accomplished family, Pearl devoted herself to her studies, eventually becoming a teacher in the New York City Public School System. As a young girl, Pearl began her life-long involvement with Tranquillity Camp. As the ideal embodiment of the Cohen family credo ''Noblesse Oblige,'' Pearl soon became the indispensable right-hand of her uncle, the late Elias A. Cohen, one of the truly great men of his time, who founded Tranquillity Camp in 1919. After his sudden passing in July of 1952, Pearl shouldered the tremendous responsiblity of keeping the Camp going. For well over 50 years, Pearl selflessly and tirelessly devoted every minute of every day to her family, and to each of the children whose character was so quietly and subtlely molded by her example. Despite her towering intellect and photographic memory, Pearl, like so many members of the Cohen family before her, never talked down to anyone. To us she was a unique individual, a giant. When flattered by anyone, she would characteristically brush it off with a small wave of her hand, saying ''It's nothing. I just do what I do.'' She made it all seem so simple. Services will be held on Sunday, August 31, 2003, 11AM at Schwartz Brothers - Jeffer Memorial Chapel, 114-03 Queens Blvd., Forest Hills, NY. In lieu of flowers, contributions to Tranquillity Camp, Inc., 170 Tranquillity Rd., Earlton, NY 12058, would be appreciated.
