        ROHN-Dr. Aryeh. The entire family of the East Midwood Jewish Center mourns the passing of this distinguished educator, dynamic leader, and consummate gentleman. For almost four decades he directed the destiny of thousands of our students. His immortality resides in the minds, hearts and souls of Jewish leaders from coast to coast who have been touched by his influence. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his dear wife, Rachel, his children & his grandchildren. Dr. Alvin Kass, Rabbi Dr. Howard Honigman, President
