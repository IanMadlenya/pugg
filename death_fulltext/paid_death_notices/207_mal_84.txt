        BENDIXEN--Henrik H. The faculty and staff of the Department of Anesthesiology of Columbia University Medical Center mourn the death of our beloved former chairman, Dr. Henrik H. Bendixen. He served as chair of our department from 1973 to 1985 and during that time was pivotal in building the clinical excellence of the department, especially in intensive care. In 1993, we were proud to honor Dr. Bendixen with the creation of an endowed professorship in his name. He was a source of strength and integrity to his faculty and he will be sadly missed. We extend our sincere condolences to his family. Margaret Wood, M.D. E.M. Papper Professor and Chair, Department of Anesthesiology Columbia University

Valerie and I extend our sympathy to Lilo and his family. Dr. Allen I. Hyman Professor Emeritus of Anesthesiology Columbia University
