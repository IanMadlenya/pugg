        BEAUDOIN-John Paul. We deeply regret the passing of John Paul Beaudoin, survived by his loving wife Jeanne, father to Vivian Agrusa, Jessica, Jennifer and Julia Beaudoin. Brother to Claude Beaudoin and grandfather to John Ross and Francesca. He was born in Manchester, NH, joined the navy in 1950, served his country in the Korean War in the submarine service as a radio operator. John received his undergraduate degree at Westchester University in Westchester, PA. He was a Fulbright scholar at the University of Lyon at Lyon, France. He started his teaching career in Chester, PA and came to Long Island to teach French and coach varsity tennis for the East Meadow school district for over 20 years. He was the quintessential educator who embraced his students as teacher, confidant and friend. After retiring in 1987 and living a full life for most, John took on the family responsibilities of raising his three beautiful daughters. John died on June 18, 2001 at North Shore University Hospital. He is sadly missed. Services Wednesday 9AM at Gutterman's Funeral Chapel, Woodbury, LI. Interment to follow at Calverton National Cemetery, Calverton, Long Island.
