Real estate developer and talent agent, beloved husband of Ada, devoted father of Judy and Herb, most cherished grandfather of Loren, Caryn, David and Sam, and their spouses. Adored greatgrandfather of Allison, Lily, Ryan, Abel, Arielle and Eli. Sid's appetite for life and his family were without equal. He was an athlete, a dancer, and a poet who could carry a tune. He was the model for how a husband should adore his wife. But more than anything else, Sid was the kind, loving light that brightened up every room. The world was a far better place because he was in it
