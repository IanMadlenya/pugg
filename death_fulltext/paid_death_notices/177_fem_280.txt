        O'MALLEY-Joan McCarthy. Colleagues and alumnae of Hunter College High School are saddened by the loss of Joan McCarthy O'Malley who died on Sunday, October 21 after a long illness. As a member of the Social Studies Department she inspired decades of students with her integrity, scholarship and dedication to the historians' craft. She served at the Hunter community in countless positions such as grade advisor, student government advisor and union chapter chair as well as treasured friend and mentor to new teachers. We extend heartfelt condolences to family and friends.
