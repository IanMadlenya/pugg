        FURTH--Enrique. Born August 4, 1928 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, died suddenly July 11, 2003 at his home in Brooklyn, NY. Survived by his three children, Susan of Bedford, NY, Hugo (Lori) of Manhattan Beach, CA, and Elizabeth of Brooklyn, NY; brother, Tomas, of Buenos Aires, former wife, Ada of Playa Del Rey, CA, and long-time friend Randi Baker of Brooklyn, NY. Preceded in death by his sister, Dorotea Furth-Cerych, of Paris, France. He was retired from a long and distinguished career as professor of computer science and data processing at New York University. He will be remembered for his quick wit, clever humor, deep knowledge of many subjects, love of books, and interesting conversation. His children remember him as a loving and proud father, extremely generous with his time, who was never too busy to talk to or spend time with his children. His family was always his highest priority. His daughter, Elizabeth, who was born to him later in life brought him great joy to the end of his days. He was also very proud of his grandchildren, Eric, Joel, and Daniel. He will be missed tremendously, as he left far too soon, by his loving family and his many many friends both in the U.S. as well as Argentina, where he visited frequently. >>AD#
