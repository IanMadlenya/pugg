        $(6$)ANDERSON--David, on September 15, 2005. The Board and staff of the Mertz Gilmore Foundation note with sadness the death of their longtime friend and the husband of Vice Chairman Elizabeth B. Gilmore. Mr. Anderson, a respected journalist and author and editorial board member for twelve years of The New York Times, was also known and respected by all members of the Foundation's family as a devoted husband and father. His writings during his illness, disseminated by e-mail to his many friends, marked the man. Gracefully and impeccably written, they were by turns insightful, touching, courageous and funny, but always deeply human, and therefore, inspiring, especially for those facing challenges of their own. He will be deeply missed.
