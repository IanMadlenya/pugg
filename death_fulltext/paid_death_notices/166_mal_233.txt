        RUDIAKOV-Michael. The Board of Directors and Advisory Council of the Manchester Music Festival mourn the passing of our dear director. His passion for the music, dedication to the education of audiences of all ages and enthusiasm for the growth of young artists will be sorely missed. We extend our deepest condolences to Judy, Ariel and Lisa.
