        FARBER-Esther. We mourn the untimely passing of our Vice President and beloved friend, Esther Farber. A founding Board member, Esther was a woman of great strength and courage, dignity and elegance. She was a skilled writer, editor and publicist and a committed Orthodox feminist for over three decades. We shall miss her sound judgment and wise counsel, her thoughtfulness and kindness. We extend our deepest condolences to her husband, Charles Gold, and sons, David, Steven and Rabbi Seth Farber. Blu Greenberg, President Robin Bodner, Exec. Dir.
