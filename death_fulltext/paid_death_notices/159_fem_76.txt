        KOMANOFF-Hannah. On April 9, at the Long Beach Medical Center in Long Beach, New York. Beloved and devoted wife of Isidore Komanoff, a stock broker and philanthropist who died in 1985; mother of Frederica Miceli, Ruth Underwood and Charles Komanoff; grandmother of Andrew Miceli, Dorian Bandy, Amalia Bandy, Daniel Komanoff and Alexander Komanoff. After graduating from the New York University School of Commerce in 1931, she enjoyed a successful career in merchandising with Abraham & Strauss. In 1947 she and her family moved from Brooklyn to Long Beach, where she dedicated her life to the care of her family and friends and to the service of her community. As a Long Beach resident for 53 years, she was in the forefront of volunteer civic work and progressive political activities, serving as an elected member of the Board of Education from 1957 to 1973 and as the Supervisor of Long Beach on the Nassau County Board of Supervisors from 1974 to 1985. With her husband and on her own, she was a generous benefactor to many local institutions and national organizations. Her Supervisor's salary was donated to charity. The Hannah and Isidore Komanoff Center for Rehabilitative Medicine and Geriatric Care, part of the Long Beach Medical Center, has been in the vanguard of its field since its inception almost 30 years ago. Decent, fair and compassionate, her life was a testimoy to her belief in the dignity, equality and inherent goodness of all people. With intelligence, humility, charm and kindness, she always put the well-being of others before herself. She will be profoundly missed and lovingly remembered. A funeral service will take place at Temple Israel of Long Beach, 305 Riverside Boulevard at Park Avenue, Monday, April 10, at noon.
