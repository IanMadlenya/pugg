        BEERS--Robert G., II. Died at his home in Manhattan on April 17, 2005, at the end of more than a 20-year battle with AIDS. Born on October 22, 1946 in Bloomsburg, PA, Beers moved to New York City following his graduation from Kenyon College. From 1969 to 1972, he was assistant to the editor of ''Crawdaddy Magazine,'' for which he also wrote features and reviews. While at the magazine, Beers became a member of Charles Ludlam's Ridiculous Theatrical Company and, from 1971 to 1976, worked on all phases of the troupe's productions and appeared in four of them. While continuing his own writing and painting, Beers later assisted on the rebuilding of several major pipe organs in New York City, including those in the Cathedral of St. John the Divine and St. Bartholomew's Church. In 1981 Beers joined the Department of Film, The Museum of Modern Art, where he worked for the next 20 years with the curators organizing exhibitions of national and international cinema. Always one to challenge himself, Beers resumed painting after becoming legally blind in 2000, and had one-man exhibitions of his work at Cooper Union, New York, and at the Gallery of the Maryland Institute College of Art, Aix-enProvence, France. He also published a seven-part novel entitled, ''James in Love.'' Beers was a passionate and discerning collector of Staffordshire, surrounding himself with dozens of fine pieces and several generations of Scottish Fold cats. Beers' love of life, elegance of word and thought, piercing wit, daring humor, and intellectual hunger and acumen are deeply missed by all those who knew him.
