        FRIEDMAN-Mark Jay, M.D. We note with sorrow the death of a highly respected physician known for his commitment to medical excellence and devotion to patient care.

He will be remembered by his colleagues at North Shore University Hospital and Long Island Jewish Medical Center, his family, and his many friends as a man who took an active role in serving others. Our deepest condolences are extended to his family. Lawrence Scherr, M.D., MACP Chief Medical Officer North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System
