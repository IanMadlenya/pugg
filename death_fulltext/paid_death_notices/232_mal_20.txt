        BENZAK--Louis R. For more than 30 years, Louis Benzak was a key leader of the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Through his skillful and steady management, he nurtured the growth of MDA's investments, providing a sturdy financial safety net for MDA's service and research programs. A national leader of the Association since 1971, Benzak presided over MDA from 1989 to 1991, and also served as vice president, corporate member, director, chairman of the finance and investment committee, assistant treasurer, treasurer and vice chairman of the executive committee. He had been a member of the Board since 1975, and was MDA's investment adviser. We're grateful for his more than three decades of incredible dedication to MDA, his tremendous business talent and his big heart. We extend our deepest condolences to his family.
