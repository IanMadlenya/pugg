        SILVERSTEIN-Etta. An outstanding person who came to our great country with courage, determination and a devotion to productivity, Etta Silverstein helped develop this country and city for the benefit of the generations to come. She devoted her life to her family and to worthy institutions. Young people benefited enormously from her dedication to help them develop their careers. Always full of enthusiasm and optimism, she was the favorite of many of us and to many students and faculty who benefited from her wisdom and generosity. She had a great deal of pleasure witnessing our students develop into the finest of physicians. Her son Larry and his spouse Klara, and their children and spouses were totally devoted to Etta, who was the glorious queen. Larry and Klara, leading citizens of our city and community, created an environment that was, and is, the gold standard for the care of parents. We at New York University School of Medicine and Etta's numerous friends mourn her passing. A wonderful friend has left our community and our institution. To Larry, Klara and their family, we extend our deepest sympathy. Saul J. Farber, M.D., MACP Provost and Dean, New York University Medical Center and School of Medicine
