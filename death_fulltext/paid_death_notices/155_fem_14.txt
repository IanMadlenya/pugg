        AARON-Sylvia. The Board of Directors, Staff and Members of the Central Queens YM&YWHA record with deep sorrow the passing of Sylvia Aaron, beloved mother of Jeffrey Aaron, our esteemed past President. Mrs. Aaron and her late husband Bernard were founders of the Y, and she transmitted her concern for Jewish community to Jeffrey, whose vision brought us to Forest Hills, serving new generations of children, families and elders in need. Our profound condolences are extended to Jeffrey and Bunnie and the grandchildren and great grandchildren who carry on Sylvia's legacy. Craig Goodman, President Judith Rosen, Chairman Ethel Liebeskind, Exec Director
