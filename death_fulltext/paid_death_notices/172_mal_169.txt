        KILIAN-Joseph. May 10, 2001. The Art and Antique Dealers League of America sadly announces the passing of its former secretary (1984-1999). His dedicated service was indispensable in the building and maintenance of the association and its fine reputation. As a member of the League, he was known for his expertise in the field of antique English silver. Our condolences go to his sister, Jerry Appenzeller & his brother, Richard Kilian. He would have been 78 next month. George Subkoff, President James Frankel, Secretary
