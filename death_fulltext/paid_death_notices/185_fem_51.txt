        PREISKEL-Barbara. To lose a close friend of over 50 years is devastating. It is hard to accept that a woman of such strength, fortitude and optimism can now live only in the thoughts of her family, friends and colleagues. Barbara was generous to a fault with her time and energy. She participated in the cultural and political life of the city, serving on a myriad of boards of educational institutions, philanthropic organizations, cultural organizations and ethics panels. Her kindness and grace endeared her to all who knew her. She will be missed. Our hearts go out to Bob, John, Rickey and Malakai. Rita and Leon Silverman
        PREISKEL-Barbara Scott. As a founding Board member in 1985, Barbara helped forge the character, integrity and effectiveness of Medical Education for South African Blacks, MESAB. Her strong sense of social justice and fairness combined with her infectious good humor, enthusiasm and wisdom were of enormous value to MESAB and to us personally. We will always treasure the memory of our friendship. Bob and her sons have our deepest sympathy. Joy and Herb Kaiser Founders, MESAB
        PREISKEL-Barbara. The Board of Trustees and the entire Wellesley College community mourn the death of Barbara Preiskel, our dear friend and esteemed colleague, who served on the Board for 14 years. A member of the Class of 1945, Barbara was the consummate trustee, fulfilling her role with creativity, diplomacy and vigor. Wellesley College is a better institution because of her leadership. We extend our deepest sympathies to her husband Bob and family.
