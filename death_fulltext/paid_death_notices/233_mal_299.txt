        BECKER--Eugene. The Juilliard School mourns the death of Eugene Becker, member of the viola and chamber music faculty since 1987, and Pre-college faculty since 1975. A distinguished musician and dedicated teacher, Gene approached his teaching at Juilliard with passion and professional expertise. He will be greatly missed by his students and colleagues. We send our deepest condolences to his wife Rae & his entire family. Joseph W. Polisi, President Stephen Clapp, Dean
