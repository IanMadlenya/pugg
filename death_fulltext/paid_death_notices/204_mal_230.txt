        FEDER--Theodore D. The Officers, Board of Directors and staff of The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) deeply mourn the passing of Theodore (Ted) Feder, who, since 1946, has played a major role in JDC operations that have aided thousands upon thousands of Jews worldwide. His lifetime of ''good deeds'' in Germany, Austria, Iran, Israel, and Romania encompassed JDC's massive postwar Displaced Persons program, its aid to cold war era Jewish emigres, its efforts on behalf of Israel's elderly and handicapped new immigrants, and its continuing assistance to Jewish communities throughout Central and Eastern Europe. His understanding of the communities with which he worked was legendary, as was his tireless advocacy on behalf of those whom he served so well. Our hearts go out to his beloved wife, Dr. Marika Feder, and to his devoted children and grandchildren. Eugene J. Ribakoff, President Jonathan W. Kolker, Chairman of the Board Steven Schwager, Exec. Vice-President
