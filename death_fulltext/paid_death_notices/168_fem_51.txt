        McINTOSH-Millicent Carey, on January 3rd, 2001. The Brearley School Community mourns the loss of our beloved former Head, who served from 1930 to 1947. The School will always cherish the memory of her warm spirit and devotion to students, shown once again when she returned to Brearley for a 100th birthday celebration in December 1998. We will forever benefit from her vision and leadership as she helped to shape Brearley into the school that it is today. A remembrance by the Brearley Community will be scheduled at a future date.
