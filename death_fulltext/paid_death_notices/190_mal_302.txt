        QUINN-William. The Horace Mann Community records with much sadness the death of William Quinn '40, cherished alumnus and star football player of 1939. Mr. Quinn returned to Horace Mann in 1951 through 1975 as the distinguished Director of Athletics and served with steadfastness, wisdom and dedication. Inducted in 1992 into the Ivy League Coaches Hall of Fame, it was noted that Mr. Quinn, ''...as coach of the Varsity Football and Wrestling Teams, developed a consistency of excellence ...leading to the formation of moral values. His players achieved a pride of accomplishment, acceptable social behavior and self confidence.'' Throughout his years at Horace Mann, William Quinn enriched our lives and we will miss his friendship, warmth and support. Mr. Quinn was the beloved husband of his late wife, Margaret. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his children William '62, Michael '66, Patricia, Margaret and Janet and to the rest of his family. Dr. Eileen Mullady Head of School Robert J.
