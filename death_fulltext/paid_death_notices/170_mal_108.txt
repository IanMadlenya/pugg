        JOFRE-Ernesto. Manager of the Amalgamated Northeast Regional Joint Board and Local 169, Union of Needle Trades, Industrial and Textile Employees. The members, officers, and staff of the Region and Local mourn the passing of their friend and leader. Always caring and generous, Ernesto symbolized all that is good in the labor movement. His loss is painful to those who loved him. Our thoughts and sympathies go out to his wife Beatrice and to his sons and grandchildren of whom Ernesto was very proud.
