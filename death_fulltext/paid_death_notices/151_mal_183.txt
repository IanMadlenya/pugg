        BUBIS-Ignatz. We mourn the loss of a great Jewish leader who was the conscience of contemporary Germany. As a survivor, he consistently and courageously spoke out on behalf of Holocaust memory and responsibility. As a result of his Holocaust experiences, he understood the singular importance of standing firm against all manifestations of intolerance and bigotry. He was a friend and an inspiration. He understood the essence of truth and spoke it. We will profoundly miss him. Our heartfelt condolences are extended to his grieving family. Bruce M. Ramer, President David A. Harris, Exec Director American Jewish Committee Eugene DuBow, Director, AJC Berlin Office
