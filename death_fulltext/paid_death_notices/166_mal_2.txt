        FELSINGER-Mortimer Nathaniel. October 30, 2000. Life will never be the same without our dear, wonderful, one-of-a-kind Morty. He was THE BEST!-a devoted son, a loving, caring husband, a dear father and father-in-law, an adoring grandfather, the best brother and brother-in-law; an asset to his profession, and a joy to all who knew him and dealt with him. Sylvia and Howard Novitt
