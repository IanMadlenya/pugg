        DUMARESQ-Eleanor. We note with sorrow the passing of a loyal friend who, along with her husband, John, were among North Shore's early supporters and tireless workers. As a long-term volunteer, as an Auxiliary President, and the wife of a Board President ''Ellie'' was considered by all a loving member of the Hospital family. She will be missed by her many friends at North Shore. We extend our most sincere condolences to her family. Saul B. Katz, Chairman, Board of Trustees John S. T. Gallagher, Chief Executive Officer North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System
        DUMARESQ-Eleanor. With ''Ellie's'' passing, we have all lost a dear, loyal and caring friend. Her association with North Shore's Auxiliary goes back to the Hospital's earliest days. She worked tirelessly-serving on the Executive Board in many positions throughout the years, and finally, as Auxiliary President. Ellie treated others with sincerity and consideration. The loss of this very special volunteer has left a void we will all feel deeply. We join together in expressing our deepest sympathy to her family. Hilary Chilton, President, Auxiliary North Shore University Hospital/ Manhasset
