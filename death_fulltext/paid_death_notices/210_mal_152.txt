        KLEBNIKOV -- Paul. The Boards of the Russian Children's Welfare Society mourn the passing of our brother, friend and supporter, Paul Klebnikov, whose family has for generations been active in our organization. Paul's grandmother, Catherine L. Nebolsine, was our President from 1974-1984 and his brother, Michael, was for many years a key member of our Board of Directors. Paul was a brave fighter for truth and his untimely death is a great loss to the worldwide Russian community and all those who believe in a free press. We offer our deepest condolences to his wife, Helen (Musa); his children, Alexander, Gregory and Sofia; his brothers, Michael and Peter; his sister, Anna, and the entire family. Russian Children's Welfare Society
