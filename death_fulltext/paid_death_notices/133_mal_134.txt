        GENSEL-Rev. John Garcia. Shepherds and music are companions, consecrated in time ever since that transcending moment of the Child in Swaddling Clothes under the Star. Little wonder then, that Pastor John Gensel would lead us around the Lord's table in melodies of prayer. ''The music of the Gospel leads us home,'' Fabernoted in his 'Pilgrim of the Night.' And John's shepherding formed a very wide circle. Heaven blessed him with a special charism, drawing friends, congregants, the lonely, the wandering and his special children-the 'shadow children' of his Town caught up in the trembling world of drugs and abandonment. He gave them hope! He gave them love! And, in so doing, stood so tall across the landscape of Daytop Village where he has served both as Trustee and Governor these many years. ''May the choirs of the angels receive him'' and may the prayerful support of us at Daytop serve to console his beloved Audrey and Family.
