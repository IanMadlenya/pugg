        GREENE-Wallace B.. Formerly of Newburgh, NY, died peacefully at age 88 on January 13 in Goshen, NY. After graduating from New York University in 1934, he founded the accounting firm of Robbins Greene and Sosnoff with offices in Newburgh and New York City (which firm subsequently merged into Citrin Cooperman and Company) and became active in the American Institute of CPAs and served as President of the MidHudson Chapter of the New York State Society of CPAs as well as Chairman of the Ethics Committee. Despite the demands of his accounting profession, he made a significant commitment to public service, serving as a member of the Board of Directors and as the President of St. Luke's Hospital in Newburgh, President of the Newburgh Lions Club and President of the Otterkill Country Club. He still managed to find time for his passion for photography, classical music and bass fishing in the St. Lawrence River. He is survived by his wife, Ruth, his son, Stephen, his daughter-in-law, Marilyn, his granddaughters, Lisa Mirsky and Jennifer Susser, and his greatgrandsons, Jack David Mirsky and Michael Drew Mirsky, all of whom he cherished and all of whom will miss him dearly. He was truly a class act. In lieu of flowers, donations in Wallace's name can be made to the Alzheimer's Association, New York Chapter, 360 Lexington Ave., NYC 10017.
