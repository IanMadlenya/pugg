        GRATZ--Donald. On November 21, after along battle with cancer. Beloved husband and helpmate of Roberta. Doting father of Laura and Rebecca. Loving brother of Bill. Loving father-in-law of Jon and Joe. Adoring grandfather of Halina, Frank, Stella and Isaac. The owner and guiding force of Gratz Industries. Donald was the consummate craftsman and so much more. His wit was like a shaft of light. With him around, you never needed to dust off the encyclopedia. He could fix anything. He zipped through the Times crossword puzzle. He shot pool like a shark and he mastered the arts of friendship and love. Funeral arrangements to be announced. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that you make a contribution to the Eldridge Street Project, 12 Eldridge St, NYC 10002, or cancer research.
