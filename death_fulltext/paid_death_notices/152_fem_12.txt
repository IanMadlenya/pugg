        CAVELLERO-BAILEY-Kim, Vice President & Director of Marketing and Sales of M.E. Sharpe Publisher, died along with her 8-year-old daughter, Jessica, in a tragic roller coaster accident in Ocean City, New Jersey, on August 28. She was 39. Known to everyone in the publishing trade as Kim Cavellero, she began her career as an Advertising Coordinator at Pergamon Press in 1984 and rose to the position of Associate Director of Marketing in 1991, before joining M.E. Sharpe in 1997. Ms. Cavellero was born in 1960 in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., where her parents operated Dick's Cabin, a restaurant begun by her paternal grandparents that was frequented by Broadway actors and professional baseball players. After graduating from Maria Regina High School, she attended the State University of New York at Plattsburg, where she met her future husband, John Bailey. A dynamic executive universally respected both for her intelligence and her genuine concern for all her colleagues, Ms. Cavellero was also a devoted wife and mother who invariably found time for family and friends, and was known to co-workers and neighbors alike as ''Wonder Woman.'' The Cavellero-Bailey home in Pomona, New York, was a frequent gathering place for neighborhood children and adults. She is survived by her husband, John Bailey; their 5-year-old daughter, Kathryn; her mother, Florence Muscavi Cavellero of Dobbs Ferry; her sister, Cheryl Cavellero of Croton, N.Y.; her brother, Arthur John Cavellero Jr., and her paternal grandmother, Catherine Cavellero, both of Dobbs Ferry; and three nieces and nephews.
