        ROTHENBERG-Susan. We at the National Jewish Outreach Program are shocked and deeply bereaved by the sudden and untimely passing of Susan Rothenberg, our dear friend, beloved co-worker and brilliant computer expert. For most of the 9-1/2 years that she was with NJOP, she and her dear sister, Phyllis Romanski, worked virtually full time as volunteers. Must of NJOP's success in reaching unaffiliated Jews (which she once was) must be attributed to her dynamic personality, soaring intellect and generous spirit. Over the years, she became a knowledgeable, committed and passionate Jew, who, among her myriad responsibilities, edited the ''Ask the Rabbi'' column on our website. We will profoundly miss this totally giving human being. Condolences to the entire famly. May her memory be a blessing for all. Services Friday, January 2, 1998, 9:45 AM, at Riverside, 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. Rabbi Ephraim Z. Buchwald, Dir.
