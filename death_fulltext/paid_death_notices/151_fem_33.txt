        CORNELL-Harriet Wilkes. Cornell University mourns the loss of a devoted friend and supporter, Harriet W. Cornell. Mrs. Cornell and her husband, George D. Cornell, were honored as Foremost Benefactors of the University for their steadfast support which helped to establish the Edward Cornell Law Librarianship, the Edward Cornell Chair of Law, and the Derek Bryceson Scholarship Fund in the College of Human Ecology. The Cornells also supported the renovation of Bailey Hall and made one of the most generous scholarship gifts in the University's history, establishing the George and Harriet Cornell Scholarship Fund. Harriet's devotion to the needs of deserving students inspired all who came in contact with her, and she was always pleased to meet with the grateful students who had benefited from her good works. Harriet had a profound love for animals, as evidenced in her support for Cornell's Veterinary College and such projects as the wildbird rehabiliation center at the Dreher Park Zoo in Palm Beach, FL. The entire Cornell community is greatly diminished by the loss of this compassionate and sensitive friend. We extend our profound sympathy to George D. Cornell at this time of great loss. Harriet Cornell will be greatly missed. Hunter R. Rawlings, III President, Cornell Univ. Harold Tanner, Chairman of the Board Cornell University
