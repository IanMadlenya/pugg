She was a copywriter at Y&R, DFS, Geer DuBois and creative director at Ketchum Advertising and Della Femina/Jeary & Partners, where she developed fragrance concepts for Coty, including !ex-cla-mation, Ici, Longing, Dark Vanilla, Celebrate, Avatar and Stetson Country.

Her first show, ''Grail,'' is scheduled to be produced in London early next year and her final project, ''The Courtesan,'' is currently in development. She is survived by her brother, Jim, of Ossining; mother, Josephine, of Sleepy Hollow and the loving friends of her ''Brain Trust.''
