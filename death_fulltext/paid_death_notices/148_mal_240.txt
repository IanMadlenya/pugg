        SHAPIRO-Howard. What does one say of a friend that could possibly express the multiplicity of that relationship? How, in a remarkably short time, we became bound by the gentle reins of friendship? Howard, we shall miss your winning ways on the tennis court, your enthusiasm for the motorcycle, your support for community activities, your creativity at work, your pleasure in being on the water, your thoughtful dinner conversation. We shall miss the irrepressible George Barton and the singular exploits of his youthful creator. We shall miss you in every way, and treasure the too few moments we shared with you. Your Westhampton Friends
