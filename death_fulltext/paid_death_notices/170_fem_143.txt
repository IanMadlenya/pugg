        JACOBSON-Rosalind. The Western Wall Heritage Foundation deeply mourns the passing of an extraordinary woman. ''Roz'' was beloved by anyone privileged to know her. Through her generosity, she established the Rosalind Jacobson Audio-Visual Center at the Western Wall Tunnels Complex in Jerusalem. Her generosity has enabled hundreds of thousands of visitors to the Tunnels to learn about their past, present and future. To Alvin, Anita and the entire family, we offer our heartfelt condolences. Ingeborg Rennert, Chairperson Sandy Eisenstat, President Joseph Yogi Loshinsky, Exec. V.P.
