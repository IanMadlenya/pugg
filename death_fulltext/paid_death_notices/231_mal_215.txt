        HUDSON--Richard. The Staff and Directors of the Center for War/Peace Studies mourn the loss of our founder. He worked tirelessly over many years to promote his vision of a democratic United Nations federation. He articulated the ''Binding Triad,'' a weighted voting system for the U.N. General Assembly. We believe it will be the next architectural change at the U.N. after the recent creation of the International Criminal Court. We extend our deepest sympathies to Dick's wife Helen, their daughters Lucinda and Anne as well as all of their supportive and loving family.
