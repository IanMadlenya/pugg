        SIRLIN-Reuben (Ruby). The Westchester Jewish Center family deeply mourns the death of our Honorary Trustee and Past President, Ruby Sirlin, and extends our sympathy to his wife, Adeline, his son and Center member, Roger, and his wife, Ellen, his daughter, Fran, and her husband, John Suydam, and his son, Arnold. Our condolences also go to his sister, Marsha Greenberg, and his grandchildren, Cliff, Robin and Jeff, and great - grandchildren, Zachary, Rachel and Grant. He shall always be remembered as a warm and loyal friend, an individual of high integrity whose concern for the needs of others and our Center was evident through the years. His philanthropy and generosity to our Center and concern for our synagogue's well-being will be missed. May the family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Randy Heller, President Jeffrey Segelman, Rabbi Dr. Irving Koslowe, Rabbi Em.
