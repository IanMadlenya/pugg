        PIEL--Gerard. The Board of Trustees and staff of the Natural Resources Defense Council mourn the passing of Gerard Piel, the founding editor and publisher of ''Scientific American.'' Mr. Piel served as a judge for the Oakes Award, one of the nation's premier environmental writing prizes, established by NRDC in 1994. We will miss his insight, enthusiasm, wit, endless inquisitiveness and boundless energy. We extend our deeply felt condolences to his family.
