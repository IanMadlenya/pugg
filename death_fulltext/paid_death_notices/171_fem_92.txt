        VICTOR-Paula Hazzan. The Cantors Assembly records with sorrow the tragic passing after a long valiant battle with cancer of a revered colleague. A warm, kind, sensitive and gentle Hazzan. She quietly served the spiritual needs of Temple Beth El of Harrisburg, Pa. since graduating from the H.L. Miller Cantorial School of the J.T.S.A. Her work inspired us all. We wish to thank the entire Jewish community of Harrisburg, Pa. for their caring and concern during her long illness. We extend our sympathy to her parents and love ones. May her memory abide as a blessing. Hazzan Chaim Najman, Pres. Hazzan Stephen J. Stein, Exec. VP Hazzan Abraham B. Shapiro, Exec. Admin.
