        MORIARTY-Michael J. Michael in his career worked for First American Title Insurance Company of New York for over 20 years. He held various positions with the company starting as Branch Counsel and rising most proudly to Senior Vice President, as well as a member of the Board of Directors of the company. All of us who knew and worked with Michael have experienced a great loss. We will miss his sage contribution and wonderful spirit for years to come. Michael's work, his kindness, care and concern for all who he met and worked with touched and helped us all. We are left with the memory of his upbeat, outgoing and wonderful optimistic attitude that infected all of us. We all have a piece of Michael that shall endure. In memory of Michael, the company has established a scholarship fund at Siena College. We remember Michael Moriarty and reach out to his wife Aileen, his children and grandchildren at this time and extend our heartfelt sympathy to them on the passing of their husband, father, and grandfather.
