        NELSON-Bernard David. On June 18, 2000 at his home in New Hyde Park. Warm and loving, an uncommonly good man. Husband of Doris; father of Edward and Joel; father-in-law of Loren and Amy; grandfather of Meredith, Jonah, Stacy, Micah and Jonathan. His loyalty, humor, gentleness and good sense will be forever missed. We love you and your memory will live with us forever.
