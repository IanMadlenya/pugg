        LEWITT--Sol, with great sorrow we mourn the death of Sol Lewitt, a remarkable artist, whose work and humanity enhanced our perception and our lives. We were privileged to have known him and to have published his prints. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Carol, his daughters, Sofia and Eva, and his very close associates Susanna Singer and Jo Watanabe. Richard Solomon, and the staff of Pace Prints.
        $(6$)LeWITT--Sol. The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art mourn the loss of Sol LeWitt. The Museum was fortunate to have enjoyed a long and close relationship with the artist. From 1960 to 1964, LeWitt worked at MoMA, first at the book counter and later as a night receptionist. In 1978, the Museum hosted LeWitt's first major museum exhibition. His vibrantly colored recent wall drawing, currently on view in the Museum's lobby, attests to the artist's long-standing imaginative vision. We will remember LeWitt not only for his prodigious and deeply influential body of work, but also for his remarkable generosity, modesty, warmth, and wit. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Carol, and to their daughters, Sofia and Eva. David Rockefeller, Honorary Chairman Ronald S. Lauder, Chairman Emeritus Agnes Gund, President Emerita Robert B. Menschel, Chairman Marie-Josee Kravis, President Glenn D. Lowry, Director
