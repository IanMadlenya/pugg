        KLEIN-Theodore ''Ted'', on June 27 at NYU Medical Center, NYC. President of Ted Klein & Company, a New York public relations firm specializing in health and medical issues, and founder of Medical Marketing Distaff (MMD), which was acquired by Snyder Communications in 1998. Ted leaves a grieving family: Carole, his wife of 45 years, his son William and daughter Emily, his sister Joanne Kaufman, and her family, his son-in-law Arthur McGrath, and daughter-in-law Caroline Kenner, and his grandchildren, Sam, Sophie and Dylan. Ted was a rare mix of drive, savvy and compassion allied with strength. His work introducing the first prescription drug products to assist with smoking cessation brought together a network of researchers, physicians, government officials and communications professionals who continue to benefit from his wisdom, passion and skill. Among his many activities, Ted provided funding for researchers at the University of Michigan School of Public Health to examine ways to discourage adolescent smoking, and for the study of pharmaceutical public relations at the University of Mississippi School of Pharmacy. He is the author or co-author of five books, including ''A User's Guide to Bypass Surgery'' (1996), ''How to Be Heard: Making the Media Work for You'' (1974) which was reissued as ''Publicity'' (1985), ''The Father's Book'' (1970) and ''Nine Months to Go'' (1956). Memorial contributions may be made to the New York Community Trust for the Ted Klein Fund and sent to 2 Park Avenue, 24th Floor, New York, NY 10016. The family will receive visitors at 39 East 10th Street, Apt 1W, on June 28 and June 29 from Noon to 7PM.
