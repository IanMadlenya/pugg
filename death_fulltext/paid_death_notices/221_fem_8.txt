        LEE--Shin Za, M.D. The Board of Trustees, Administration and Medical Staff of Blythedale Children's Hospital notes with deep sorrow the sudden passing of our dear friend and colleague. As an outstanding member of our Medical Staff in the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine for almost 25 years, Dr. Lee provided superb medical care for all of her patients. With her ready smile, her warmth, compassion and knowledge, Dr. Lee touched all of those with whom she came in contact. She made a positive impact on the lives of her patients and she left a wonderful legacy. She will be missed by all of us who knew her. It is not only a tragic loss for Dr. Lee's family, but for the Blythedale family as well. John L. Furth, Chair, Board of Trustees Larry Levine, President and CEO Joelle Mast, Ph.D, M.D., Chief Medical Officer
