He emigrated to the United States in January 1914, with his mother and two sisters (his third sister was born in New York City). He graduated from Eastside Evening High School, New York University and St. John's Law School, all of which he attended at night while working fulltime. He passed the NY State Bar Exam on his first try. He was a proud World War II veteran. He was a tireless salesman and sales manager for Nutone/Scoville; on his retirement in the 1970's he was managing sales for the entire Northeast region. After his retirement, he was active in his condo association at 840 Ocean Drive, Juno Beach, FL, serving on the board and as president. He served similarly in the resident's association of Shinnecock Shores in East Quoque, Long Island, where he was a board member, past president, and building and roads chairman. He and his late wife, M. Victoria Karagozian Kazan, endowed a visiting professorship, a publication and lecture fund, and various other projects of the Armenian Studies Program at California State University at Fresno.
