Her work in silkscreening was exhibited throughout Scandinavia. She met her husband at the University of Copenhagen Graduate Study Program in 1948. She came to the U.S. in 1951, where they married. She became a U.S. citizen in 1996. Inger Stovall lived for 25 years in Mountain Lakes, NJ, with a seasonal home in Barnegat Light, NJ, for 19 years. Most recently she had resided in Sarasota, FL., with homes in Manhattan and Honesdale, PA, as well. Active in social work, she operated a Cheer Ring helpline service at Marble Collegiate Church for 20 years.

She is also survived by her four children, Sten T. Stovall of London, England, Sam Stovall of Jersey City, NJ, I. Benedikte Stovall of Bryn Mawr, PA, Robert H. Stovall Jr. of Fanwood, NJ, plus six beloved grandchildren. In addition, she raised Enrique Del Riego and Eduardo Del Riego now of Miami, FL., who joined her family via the ''Pedro Pan'' program from Cuba in 1962.
