        ROSS--Benjamin, who died on June 2nd, 2004, was a true but quiet hero. Born in Poland in 1921, he survived the Warsaw Ghetto, Dachau, and started a new life with his wife Esther in New York. Although he came to America with nothing he went on to own three bakeries--most notably the Clearview Bake Shop. For over two decades he delighted New Yorkers by supplying Zabar's and Balducci's with their Russian coffee cake and strudels. He retired to Hallandale, FL twelve years ago. He is survived by his loving wife and best friend Esther, and by his children Steven Ross, his wife Linda Kent and children Lydia and Gabriel, and Fran Ross Berger, her husband, Dr. William Berger and children Sydney and Harrison. Funeral services on June 7th, 10AM at Gutterman's, 8000 Jericho Turnpike, Woodbury, Long Island. Shiva will be held at the home of Dr. and Mrs. Berger from Monday to Friday.
