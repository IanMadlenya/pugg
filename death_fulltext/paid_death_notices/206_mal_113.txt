        WEIHS--Kurt. We mourn the loss of a great man, a pioneering designer and art director, as well as an immensely powerful painter and sculptor. His design oeuvre is remarkable, including the actual design of the CBS Eye as the master designer in the Bill Golden atelier at CBS Television, and then a forty-year career as a creative director and designer working alongside George Lois at his ad agencies. As young Holocaust survivors, Kurt and his wife Erika, also an accomplished artist, forged a magnificent artistic and spiritual life in America. Our deep condolences to Erika, their son John and their grandson, Kris, as they lay Kurt to rest beside his beloved son Tommy. Service Wednesday, March 10 at 12:00 noon, Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Ave at 80th St.
