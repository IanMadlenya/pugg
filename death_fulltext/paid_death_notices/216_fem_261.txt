        DUFFICY--Hon. Ann B. The Board of Trustees, the Medical Staff and the employees of Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, Jamaica Hospital Nursing Home Co (Trump Pavilion) and their parent corporation, MediSys Health Network, mourn the passing of our esteemed Chairperson, Ann B. Dufficy. Her leadership, compassion and resolute support helped us to survive, grow and provide much needed services to patients in the communities we serve. Since her retirement from the State Supreme Court Bench, there was never a community event that didn't benefit from her presence. Tireless and always unruffled, her wise counsel and vision were a source of inspiration to all. Our sincere condolences to her son Hon. Timothy Dufficy, daughter-inlaw Mary and granddaughter Doreen.
