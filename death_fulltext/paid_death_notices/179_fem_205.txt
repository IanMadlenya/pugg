        KATZ-Phyllis. The artists, board and staff of The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center note with sorrow the passing of our patron and friend, Phyllis Katz. A gifted and accomplished artist in her own right, Phyllis brought a special quality of insight and understanding to her generous support. We will greatly miss her dramatic vivacity, her good humor and intelligence, and most of all the warm friendship that she bestowed so widely among us. Our deep sympathy goes to her husband Abraham Katz and her four sons. Donaldson Pillsbury, Chairman Peter Frelinghuysen, President David Shifrin, Artistic Dir Norma Hurlburt, Exec Dir
