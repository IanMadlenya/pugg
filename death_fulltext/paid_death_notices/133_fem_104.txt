        LEUW-Dorothy Drexler. The Yeshiva University family is saddened by the passing of a longtime, cherished friend who, with her late husband, Joseph M. Drexler, was a YU Guardian, Founder of our Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and Fellow of our Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. Mr. Drexler was a former YU Trustee and past Chairman of the Florida Friends of YU. Mrs. Leuw will be missed by the YU administration and all who were privileged to work with this admired philanthropist. May her memory remain as a source of enduring blessing to mankind. We extend our heartfelt condolences to all her loved ones. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University David S. Gottesman, Chairman Board of Trustees
