        MARCECA-Robert. The partners, associates and staff at Hartman & Craven LLP are profoundly saddened by the loss of our dear friend and colleague, Bob Marceca. Bob was a real estate visionary who almost single handedly changed the cooperative/condominium landscape in New York. Working with Bob was a joyful adventure. We will greatly miss his friendship and leadership.
        MARCECA-Robert H. With profound sorrow we will forever remember your entrepreneurial and idealistic spirit. Our thoughts and prayers are with you, Nini, and the entire family. Bob's generous legacy lives on forever in our hearts. The Legacy Foundation Rabbi Naftali Reich, Director
