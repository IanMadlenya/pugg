        GORBATY-Jan. The House of Steinway & Sons notes with profound sorrow the passing of our beloved friend and devoted Steinway Artist Jan Gorbaty on September 6, 1999 in New York City. A native of Poland, Jan Gorbaty was not only an acclaimed concert pianist, but also an indefatigable champion of the music of Frederic Chopin. Professor Gorbaty was President of the Chopin Foundation Council of Greater New York and a Vice President of the Chopin Foundation of the United States. A beloved teacher, he enriched the lives of countless young pianists in the United States and abroad. A Polish patriot in the truest sense, Jan Gorbaty will be deeply missed by all fortunate to know him. To his daughter, Zosia, we extend our heartfelt condolences. Bruce A. Stevens, President Peter B. Goodrich, V.P. Worldwide Concert and Artist Activities
