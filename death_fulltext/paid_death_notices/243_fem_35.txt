        ROTHSCHILD--Diane, The One Club and its board of directors mourn the loss of Diane Rothschild, esteemed former member of the board, award winning copywriter and 2005 Creative Hall of Fame inductee. She fought bravely with lung cancer. Diane began her legendary career as a copywriter at Doyle Dane Bernbach. In 1986 she founded Grace & Rothschild with fellow Creative Hall of Fame member Roy Grace. She was recently Vice Chairman of Della Femina Rothschild Jeary and Partners. Diane will be missed by her many friends and colleagues. We extend our deepest sympathies to Alan, Alexandra and Brenda.
