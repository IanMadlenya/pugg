        LIPPERT-Felice. The Board of Directors and membership of The American Ireland Fund mourn the death of our dear friend, Felice Lippert, who, with her late husband Al, was a central member of the AIF Family. Her wit, charm and potent persuasiveness, matched only by her total commitment to her special charities, saw fulfillment in the establishment of the ''Al and Felice Lippert Chair of Jewish Studies'' at Trinity College, Dublin. Felice will be greatly missed and lovingly remembered by her many friends in the AIF who join with us in extending their sincere condolences to her sons and their families.
        LIPPERT-Felice. She was the epitome of a cosmopolitan woman. Her love, laughter, kindess and warmth will always be remembered. Our deepest sympathy to her children and grandchildren. Priscilla, Sol, Jordan and Jill
