        SCHORR-Maria Grandy. The staff and Board of the Dance Notation Bureau have lost a charismatic Chair and a warm friend. Maria brought to every undertaking her endearing humor and positive energy, always bringing out the best in those around her. She asked dancers always to retain their sense of joy. Remembering her will always bring to us a sense of joy. We send our deepest sympathy to her family. Sheldon Soffer, Vice Chair Ilene Fox, Executive Director
