        BLOOM-Robert A. It is with the most profound sense of loss and sadness that the entire staff of the Beth Abraham Health Services' community record the passing of our dear, cherished friend and colleague, Bob Bloom. Devoted to his family and dedicated to our patients, Bob's wisdom, guidance and ever-present good humor provided a source of encouragement for all of us. We will always remember and miss his gentle ways, his compassionate spirit. Heart and soul he was one of the good guys. To his wife Susan, his mother, his children and grandchildren, we offer our deepest sympathy. The Staff Beth Abraham Health Services
