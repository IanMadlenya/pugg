        HELSEL-Milton. A very special, sweet, kind man has died. We will remember his softness and his caring for all people. He will be missed by all who knew him. Our thoughts are with his wife Selma, his children Meryl and Bob Meltzer, and Eileen Swartz, his grandchildren Neal Meltzer and Sara Meltzer and Reesa Swartz Fischer and Steven Fischer and Jeffrey Swartz and Shayna Swartz and his great grandchildren.
