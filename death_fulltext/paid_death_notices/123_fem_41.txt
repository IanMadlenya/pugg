        SNAPP-Bette. All of us at G. Schirmer mourn the death of our great friend and mentor. We shared much wonderful music and learned so much from her. Bette inspired and motivated us, not only professionally but in living life to the fullest. Her death creates a huge void in the new-music community, in which she was such a vital presence. We will try to find her grace, compassion, courage, and optimism amid our grief. Our hearts go out to Bob, Shannon, Ben, her mother, sister, and entire family.
        SNAPP-Bette. The staff of Boosey & Hawkes mourns the loss of a dear friend and colleague. We cherished Bette's sense of humor, imagination, compassion, and camaraderie, and we deeply admired her courage. We will miss having her in our lives and send our condolences to her family.
