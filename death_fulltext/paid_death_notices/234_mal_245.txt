        ACKEMANN--Andrew C. passed quietly on July 19, having valiantly fought pancreatic cancer. Andrew was an acknowledged expert in rationalization of complex global organizational structures. Before beginning his coaching practice in 1999, he served as a management consultant with McKinsey & Co. Before McKinsey, Andrew served as Staffing Director for the Worldwide Commercial Sector of Booz Allen Hamilton. Previously, he served as a consultant to the Chief Executive Officer of Alexander & Alexander and was the Chief of Staff to the CEO of MGM. From 1967-1976, Andrew served in the U.S. Navy as commanding officer of a coastal minesweeper and of Special Boat Group TWO, a unit of the Navy's Special Warfare Operations Command. He served, pro bono, as a National Safety Inspector for the five U.S. Outward Bound Schools and for NOLS (the National Outdoor Leadership School). He earned a B.A. from Wesleyan University and read in Liturgics and Sacred Theology at the Yale Divinity School. From September 12, 2001 until September 15, 2001, Andrew served in the search and rescue operations at the site of the World Trade Center attack. He is survived by his wife, Deborah, and his children, Lucy, Alexander, Mallory, Merrill, John and August. Interment will be held at Arlington National Cemetery. Funeral Arrangements are entrusted to Frank E. Campbell, The Funeral Chapel. We will miss his compassionate affection for everyone he loved. A calm sea never made a skillful sailor. Rest in peace.
