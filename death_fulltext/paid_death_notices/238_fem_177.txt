        COMDEN--Betty. The Dramatists Guild Council mourns the death of Betty Comden, one of our most beloved members. As her colleagues, we valued not only the intelligence and flair of her work as a lyricist and book-writer for musicals, but the effortless grace and good-humor she possessed as a person. She was a steadfast member of the Guild Council, and a generous and wise mentor for young songwriters. Our deepest sympathies to her family and to her loved ones at this difficult time. John Weidman President The Dramatists Guild of America
