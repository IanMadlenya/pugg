        VLADECK--Judith, was an icon, esteemed labor lawyer, and feisty, spirited woman who was an early champion of employment rights for women. She was there for us and the women we serve at Nontraditional Employment for Women (NEW) from the beginning, and we are forever indebted to her. NEW named its headquarters the Judith P. Vladeck Center for Women in 1989, and we will miss her leadership and wisdom. NEW's Board and staff extend our heartfelt condolences to her family. The many women working in construction to build our city today are a tribute to Judith's commitment and legacy.
