        EGOL-Laura, age 83, died peacefully in Miami, FL on June 7, 1997. She will be missed and always remembered by her children Lewis (Gail), Andrew (Nancy) and Mandy; her brother Hy (Ruth); her grandchildren Erik, Jessica and Jared; her cousins, nieces, nephews and countless friends from the Bronx, NY and Hallandale and Miami, FL. She gave tirelessly to her family and to many others through her volunteer work with the blind, the homeless, the aged and infirm. A funeral was held for the family at Beth David Cemetery in Elmont where she was buried next to her husband Albert. The family asks that those who wish to remember her do so through service to others.
