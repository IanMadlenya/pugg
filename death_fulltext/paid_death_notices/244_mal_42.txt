        SAROSDY--Will. In Loving Memory. June 7, 1985 -May 5, 2006. It's been a year since you left us, Will. We grieve the loss of your wonderful, loving presence, just as we celebrate the joy of having shared your remarkable, tooshort life. We know the pain of depression was too intense for you to bear. While we now struggle with the pain of grief, we know you are at peace and suffer no more. We think of you every day and miss you more than words can express. You were an angel sent to us by God and now you are home. We love you always and forever. Mom, Dad, Frank, Grace and all of your loving grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, friends, teammates and young swimmers.
