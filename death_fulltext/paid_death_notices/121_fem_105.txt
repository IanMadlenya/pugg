        WEIL-Henrietta Simons. The officers, leadership and staff of UJAFederation mourn the passing of Henrietta Simons Weil, a member of a legendary family with a proud history in the community. Mrs. Weil was a dedicated philanthropist who supported numerous charities throughout her life. She was the wife of Frank L. Weil, founder of the law firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, who passed away in 1957. The firm continues to be one of UJA-Federation's most generous supporters. Mrs. Weil was also the granddaughter of the first Jewish governor in the United States, Moses Alexander of Idaho, a champion of human rights. We extend our deepest sympathies to her family and loved ones. May you be consoled among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Larry A. Silverstein, Board Chair Louise B. Greilsheimer, President Stephen D. Solender, Exec. V.P.
