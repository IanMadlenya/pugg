        DELACORTE -- Albert. The Board of Trustees, the faculty, students and staff of Teachers College, Columbia University are deeply saddened by the passing of Albert Delacorte, who was a friend of the College and of education. Mr. Delacorte, an alumnus of Teachers College, was dedicated to working with underserved young people through education-spending many years as a teacher, himself, and providing financial support for initiatives in the arts, the City and the schools. His generous support of the Peace Corps Fellows Program at Teachers College continues to make a tremendous difference in the lives of the Fellows teaching in New York City schools and in the lives of the children they teach. Many hundreds of people have benefited from Mr. Delacorte's generosity without ever having known his name. His enthusiasm, devotion and vision toward improving urban education serve as an inspiration to us all. Arthur Levine, President, Teachers College, Columbia University
        DELACORTE -- Albert. The staff and Trustees of the Community Service Society of New York mourn the loss of a personal friend and generous supporter. His genuine concern for all New Yorkers in need will be sorely missed. Our deepest sympathy goes to his family. David R. Jones, President and CEO, CSS
