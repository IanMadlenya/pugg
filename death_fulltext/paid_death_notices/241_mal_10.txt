        FENTON--Arnold N. North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, NY, and its medical staff mourn the passing of our long-time colleague, Arnold N. Fenton, M.D., a highly revered physician beloved by both his patients and fellow Doctors. The Hospital's former chairman of obstetrics and gynecology, he made extraordinary contributions to the hospital for more than three decades. His very persona represented dignity, respect, intelligence and compassion -all bound together with integrity and kindness. We will cherish his memory. Dennis Dowling Executive Director James Sullivan, M.D. President, Medical Staff
