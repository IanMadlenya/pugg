        DAVIS-Philip. The lawyer who established the precedent that a purchasor of a ticket on the New York Central Railroad is contractually entitled to a seat, died March 26, 1998 in Basking Ridge, NJ at the age of 90. Mr. Davis was born January 10, 1908 and worked from the age of 12 when his father died. He graduated from Fordham Law School in 1929 and opened his own office for the practice of law in November 1930. He continued to practice law in New York City until October 17, 1997 when he suffered a stroke. During law school, Mr. Davis worked as the chief usher at the Mark Strand Theatre. In 1937, Mr. Davis purchased a ticket to travel on the New York Central Railroad from Albany to N.Y. The train did not have sufficient seats for some of the ticketholders and Mr. Davis filed suit seeking recovery of $47.80. In 1937, Mr. Davis won a decision from the New York Court of Appeals holding that a ticketholder is entitled to a seat and that the railroad had an obligation to add additional cars to accommodate all of the passengers. In 1973, Mr. Davis sued the Penn Central Railroad for $1.80 because he was not provided with a seat on a trip from Grand Central Station to North White Plains. Relying on his prior precedent, he won a judgment against Penn Central Railroad for $1.80 plus $10 for discomfort. Mr. Davis became a Mason on December 6, 1934 and served as Grand Master of Pacific Lodge No. 233 in 1942. He was also president of Rehoboth Lodge No. 38 of B'nai B'rith in 1941. He was an active and devoted alumnus of Fordham Law School & organized reunions of the Class of 1929 every five years from 1934 through 1994. Mr. Davis organized a group called ''The Strand Alumni'' comprised of the ushers at the Mark Strand Theatre from 1926-1930 which met every five years from 1935 on. Mr. Davis is survived by his wife, Miriam, his son, Jed Davis; his daughter, Helen Davis Chaitman; by his grandchildren, Jennifer Chaitman, Alison Davis Curry, Larissa Rose, Aglaia Davis, and Rhadamanthus Davis; and by his great-grandchild, Emma Davis Curry.
