        BERK-Fran. We will miss your intelligence, wit and warmth. Our grief is only surpassed by the love you had for those surrounding you. Our deepest condolences to her beloved husband, Allan; son, Michael; sisters, Susie and Janet, and her father, David. The Katz Family
        BERK-Francine. She was all goodness and brought sunshine to every human being, but most of all to Alan, Michael, her parents and sisters. For them, for us and for all of Fran's many friends, the sun will not shine quite so brightly any more. Audrey, Harvey, Eric and Mark Feuerstein
