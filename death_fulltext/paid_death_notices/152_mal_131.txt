Kennedy (all of Albuquerque, NM), dear brother of Essie Solof (Hollywood, FL), died September 3, 1999 at home while sleeping quietly.

An accomplished student of General Semantics and a vocal political presence and conscience in both Albuquerque and NY, he was a familiar contributor to Letters to the Editor and presented TV commentary in matters of social policy and political position. For many years he was an executive job counsellor for THinc., an executive placement corporation in NYC. Surviving him are sistersin-law Sue Gilbert, Helen Sack, Shirley Pesses, Evelyn Greenberg, Marian Heckler and brother-in-law Ted Schoenfeld, as well as numerous nieces and nephews. A private service and cremation have taken place. Donations in his memory may be made to the Albuquerque Center for Peace and Justice, 144 Harvard SE, Albuquerque, NM 87106.
