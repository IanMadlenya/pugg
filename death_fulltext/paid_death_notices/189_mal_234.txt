        GRANT-John B. Jr. Greenberg Traurig mourns the loss of our great partner and friend, John Grant. We extend our deepest sympathy to his family on such an untimely loss. John was a quality lawyer and a truly wonderful person. He was uniquely respected by all of his peers for his integrity, judgement, perspective, and sense of responsibility, all leavened by a wonderful sense of humor. He will be missed by all who had the honor of knowing him.
