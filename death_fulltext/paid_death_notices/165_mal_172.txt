Known as a ''problem solver par excellence'', he was also a successful real estate owner and manager, work he continued to do after moving to Florida in 1991. Adored by family and friends, he always had a firm hand shake, a winning smile, and a great one-liner. Services will be held Friday, October 13, 2000 at 11 AM at Beth Israel Memorial in Delray Beach. The family will receive friends on Saturday and Sunday at Henry and Fran Storper's home in Miami.
