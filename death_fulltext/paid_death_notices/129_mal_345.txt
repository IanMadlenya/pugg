        RICE-James P. of Chicago, Illinois. It is with deep sadness that the Jewish Federation/Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago mourns the passing of James P. Rice, who died on October 25, 1997. He was an internationally renowned authority on immigration whose critical work had a profound impact on the lives of Jewish refugees after World War II and beyond. From 1966 to 1979, he served as Executive Vice President of the Jewish Federation. Under his leadership, the Federation underwent a major merger and reorganization to expand and more effectively serve people in need. In 1985, Mr. Rice received the Julius Rosenwald Memorial Award, the Jewish Federation's highest honor. His entire professional career was devoted to assisting the less fortunate. His wisdom, leadership, dedication and friendship will be missed. Barbara Hochberg, Chairman of the Board Steven B. Nasatir, President
