        MOSS-Jeffrey. We are devastated by the loss of our friend, colleague and mentor Jeff Moss. For 30 years his creativity, talent and integrity have been at the heart of Sesame Street. We take comfort in knowing that his spirit, his characters, his silliness and his songs will continue to delight, educate and nuture millions of children around the world for generations to come. Long live Rubber Duckie! The Writers of Sesame Street
