        TAFFEL-Alexander. The Alumni Association of the Bronx High School of Science marks with deep regret the passing of Dr. Alexander Taffel, the school's second principal, who served with distinction for two decades. His memory is honored by the institution he nurtured and the students whose lives it has transformed.
