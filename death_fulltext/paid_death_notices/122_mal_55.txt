        CLEARY-Peter J. It is with deep sadness that we mourn the loss of our muched loved colleague and friend. For over 40 years, Peter shared his expertise as an appraiser and auctioneer. Our officers, appraisers, and staff extend our deepest sympathy to the entire Cleary family. We will forever miss Peter's wisdom, his friendship and his devotion. Kathleen M. Doyle, Chairman William Doyle Galleries
