        PLATOVSKY-Andrew. The employees of the NYC Departments of City-wide Administrative Services and Design and Construction mourn the untimely passing of their colleague, Andrew Platovsky, 49. An exemplary civil servant for 26 years and accomplished landscape architect, he was devoted to the goal of beautifying the grounds of the public buildings of our City. His recent notable achievements included the awardwinning Veterans Memorial Garden at Queens Borough Hall, and the new pedestrian plazas surrounding the Municipal Building and Police Headquarters in lower Manhattan. Although just now nearing completion, these plazas are already widely acclaimed. He not only designed great spaces but also ensured that the maintenance of the grounds continued after construction. The care of these parks reached a level of perfection rarely seen in City-owned public spaces. New York has been deprived of a gifted and devoted professional. We extend our deepest sympathy to his entire family.
