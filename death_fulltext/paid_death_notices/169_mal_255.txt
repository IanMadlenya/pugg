        FRIEDHOFF-Arnold, J. The Silberstein Aging and Dementia Research and Treatment Center of the New York University School of Medicine mourns with profound sorrow the death of Professor Arnold Friedhoff. For more than a quarter of a century, Dr. Friedhoff was the Director of the Millhauser Laboratories at NYU Medical School. He was a wonderful inspiration for us. His vast knowledge and wisdom were always available to the many researchers who sought his assistance. He worked unstintingly to advance the understanding and treatment of mental illness. We send our deepest respects & sympathies to his family.
