        CAPALDI-Marilyn. Died peacefully at home on May 23rd after courageously battling Cancer. She was the Librarian at Booker T. Washington Intermediate School 54 for over 20 years. Her death is mourned by her mother Thelma, her daughters Diana and Elizabeth, her grandchildren Anna, Sophie and David, and all who knew her, learned from her and loved her. She inspired many by her committment to the children she taught and to the colleagues with whom she shared her passion. She continues to be dearly loved and will be greatly missed. In lieu of flowers please take a moment to do something you might have enjoyed doing with her. We thank you for any contributions to causes she supported.
