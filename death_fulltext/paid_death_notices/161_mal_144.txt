        SEGAL-George. It is with tremendous sadness that the Trustees and staff of The Jewish Museum observe the loss of artist George Segal. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Helen, their children and family. The Museum's long relationship with George includes a retrospective of his work in 1998, and wonderful works in the Museum's collection. His world-renowned sculpture, ''Holocaust'', is on view in the Museum's permanent exhibition galleries. Since its acquisition in the early 1980s, our visitors have been drawn to this work as a Holocaust memorial within the Museum, and it is a centerpiece for education programs. We mourn the loss of this exceptionally warm-hearted artist whose deep humanity, sweetness and extraordinary artistic gifts will be greatly missed. Joan Rosenbaum, Director Robert J. Hurst, Chairman
        SEGAL-George. The Board of Trustees and staff at the Whitney Museum of American Art note with great sadness the passing of George Segal. Segal was a seminal American artist who gained widespread recognition in the 1960s for his lifesized tableaux sculptures. The full extent of Segal's influence on succeeding generations of artists is becoming apparent as contemporary artistsa are placing a renewed emphasis on the human body and figuration. We extend our sincere condolences to his wife, Helen, his children Rena and Jeffery and his brother Morris. Leonard A. Lauder, Chairman Joel S. Ehrenkranz, President Maxwell L. Anderson, Director
        SEGAL-George. The members of the American Academy of Arts and Letters note with sorrow the death of their esteemed colleague whose passing will be deeply mourned by the world of art.
