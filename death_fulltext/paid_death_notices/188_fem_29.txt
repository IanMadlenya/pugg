        WEISSMAN-Hope P. The Faculty, Students and Alumni/ ae of Wesleyan University's College of Letters, mourn the death of Professor Hope Weissman. She was a dedicated colleague, an extraordinary and daring intellectual, and a devoted teacher. Since 1974 she provided us with a unique spark, and we will miss her sorely.
