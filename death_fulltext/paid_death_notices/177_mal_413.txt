        WILDENSTEIN-Daniel. We, the Directors of The Florence Gould Foundation and our wives express our profound sorrow to the Wildenstein family on the death of our distinguished colleague, Daniel Wildenstein. From the beginning, the activities of the Foundation have always been enriched by the wisdom and informed counsel of Daniel Wildenstein as well as by his lively and generous spirit. We consider ourselves very fortunate to have been blessed for so long by his friendship, his competence, and his discerning intelligence. His legacy to the mission of the Foundation will endure.
