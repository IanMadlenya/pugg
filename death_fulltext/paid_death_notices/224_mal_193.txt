        HOROWITZ--Raymond J. 89. On September 18, 2005. Beloved by his daughter Judy Babcock and his late wife Margaret, and loving brother of Edith King. His career as a an attorney was punctuated by decades of wise counsel and thoughtful action. A pioneer art collector who promoted and appreciated scholarship in the field of American Impressionism, and along with Margaret, formulated a premiere collection. A caring friend, always ready with a willing ear. There will be a memorial occasion to be announced at a later date.
