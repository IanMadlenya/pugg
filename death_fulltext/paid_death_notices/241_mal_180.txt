        FRICK--Henry Clay II, Dr. The Board of Trustees and the Staff of the Wildlife Conservation Society are saddened by the death of our long-time friend and Honorary Trustee, Dr. Henry Clay Frick, II. A Trustee since 1952, Clay was a member of several Committees including the Executive Committee and the Aquarium Committee, where he was particularly involved; he had also served as Board Vice Chairman. Clay carried on the Frick family commitment to saving wildlife and wild lands personally and through the generosity of the Helen Clay Frick Foundation by providing critical operating support for the Bronx Zoo and New York Aquarium. His kindness and friendship will be missed. Our deepest sympathies to his wife, Pemmy, and the entire Frick family. David T. Schiff, Chairman Howard Phipps Jr., Chairman Emeritus Steven E. Sanderson, President & CEO Wildlife Conservation Society

The Trustees and staff of the American Museum of Natural History are saddened by the death of Dr. Henry Clay Frick II, Trustee of the Museum since 1960, and Honorary Trustee since 1999. Along with his family, he was a steadfast friend and benefactor of the Museum's paleontology division, contributing an invaluable collection of specimens and endowing the Childs Frick Collection, the Frick Curatorship, and the Frick Laboratory Fund in honor of his father, a paleontologist. He was a valued member of the Board who brought extraordinary intelligence and dedication to the Museum's mission to educate the public about the natural world and global cultures. Our sympathies go out to his wife Emily, a dear friend to the Museum for many years, and to the entire Frick family. Lewis W. Bernard, Chairman Ellen V. Futter, President
