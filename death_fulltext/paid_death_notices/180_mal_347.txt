        ASCH-Stuart S., M.D. Professor Emeritus of Clinical Psychiatry, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, and Honorary Attending Psychiatrist, New York-Presbyterian Hospital. An unusually gifted teacher, clinician and administrator, Dr. Stuart Asch was a beloved member of our department since 1976. He combined warm compassion with intense intellectual curiosity, and taught his students and colleagues as he cured his patients. His verbal fluency and quick sense of humor insured that the process was always fun. Heartfelt condolences to his devoted wife, Mary, and to his children and grandchildren, of whom he was always proud. Jack D. Barchas, M.D. Chairman, Dept of Psychiatry Philip J.
