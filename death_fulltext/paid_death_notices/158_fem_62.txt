        XIE-Xide. We will miss our beloved Madame Xie or ''Hilda'' as she was known to many of her friends. She passed away Saturday night in Shanghai, China at the age of 79. Madame Xie was President of Fudan University in Shanghai. She graduated from Smith College, received her Ph.D. in physics at MIT and a mathematics degree from Xiamen University in China. Madame Xie was a dear friend and mentor and we wish to convey our deepest condolences to her son, Cao Weizheng, her daughter-in-law, Ker, and her granddaughter on whom she doted, Karen. Madame Xie taught us the meaning of selflessness. Our sincerest condolences to her friends in China and her friends all over the world. Ginny Kamsky and Kamsky Associates, Inc.
