        BARUCH-Freda Diamond. The Board, staff and entire League Treatment Center family extend our deepest sympathy to the family of Freda Diamond Baruch, who was a member of our board of Trustees for many years. Freda was an outstanding designer. Her elegance was matched by her devotion to our handicapped children. Bernice Sherman, Board of Trustees Hannah Achtenberg Kinn, Executive Director
