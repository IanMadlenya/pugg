        ELLIOTT-Madelyn. Of Omaha came to NYC in 1959, moveing easily between Harper & Row and the Metropolitan Opera, working with friends such as Rise Stevens, Christa Ludwig, Evelyn Lear, Birgit Nillsen, Jon Vickers, Joan Sutherland, the late Leonie Rysanek and husband Eleu. She died September 25th, near her 75th birthday in weakened health in Manasquan, NJ. Survived by her sisters Helen, Medora and their children. Her causes were: Broadway Cares: Equity Fights AIDS, Sierra Club and Running Strong for American Indian Youth. Her ashes will be spread with Tosca under the cottonwoods in Great Grannies meadow by the Big Thompson in Loveland, Colorado. Her spirit is probably visiting Vienna right now. Let's shed tears and raise a torte to Maddy.
