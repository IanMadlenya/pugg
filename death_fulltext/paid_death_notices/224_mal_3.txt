        MESSENGER--David C. Retired partner and friend. Trained as a lawyer as well as a CPA, Dave had a facile mind and a gift of persuasion that was a joy to behold, especially when applied to tax agents. On a personal level, he was a skillful storyteller with an inexhaustive supply of jokes. Dave was a partner with our firm for many years who kept in touch after retirement. We will be missing that now, but hope that he has found peace from the illnesses that plagued him. Our sincerest sympathy is extended to Dave's wife Bobbi, his two sons & many grandchildren. The Partners and staff of H.J. Behrman & Co.
