        ARMSTEAD -- Robert. The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art deeply mourn the passing of our devoted colleague and friend, Robert Armstead, a special security officer at the Museum for 21 years. Before retiring in 1996, he demonstrated unflagging warmth to generations of visitors. His graciousness, ease, and generosity of spirit were a beacon to those who followed in his path. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his nephew, our colleague Samuel Nelson; Mr. Nelson's wife, our colleague Meldine Nelson; and the entire family, for the tragic losses they have endured.
