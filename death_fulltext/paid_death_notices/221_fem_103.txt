        DIMITROVA -- Ghena. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of soprano Ghena Dimitrova. She made her company debut in 1987 as Turandot, a role seemingly tailor-made for her thrilling voice, and also enjoyed success with us in such roles as Minnie in ''La Fanciulla del West,'' Santuzza in ''Cavalleria Rusticana,'' Gioconda, and Tosca. We extend our sincerest sympathies to her family and friends. Joseph Volpe, Gen. Mgr. James Levine, Music Dir.
