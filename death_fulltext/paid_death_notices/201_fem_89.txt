        McNEILL--Elizabeth. The Institute for Psychoanalytic Training and Research mourns the loss of our esteemed colleague and friend, Elizabeth (Betty) McNeill. Betty was a founding member of our organization, she began our first referral service, and was instrumental in arranging the move, many years ago, to our current location on 3rd Ave. Betty's love for psychoanalysis, her devotion to IPTAR, and her zest for life will be deeply missed.
