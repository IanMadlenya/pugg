        SHNEIDERMAN--Eileen. The International Center of Photography notes with sorrow the passing of Eileen Shneiderman, Honorary Trustee, and close friend of the institution since its founding. She was the sister of David Seymour (''Chim''), one of the pioneering photojournalists to whom ICP was dedicated. A gracious and sensitive person, we were fortunate to have her in our midst for these many years. Our condolences go to her family and especially to her son Ben.
