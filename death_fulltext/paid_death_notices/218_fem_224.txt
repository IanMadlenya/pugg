        BLUMENSTOCK--Lea. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum mourns the passing of Lea Blumenstock, mother of Ruth B. Mandel, Vice Chair of our governing Council. A passenger on the S.S. St. Louis, which was denied entry into the U.S. in 1939, Mrs. Blumenstock found refuge in England, with her husband and daughter, and later immigrated to the United States. The Museum extends its deepest sympathy to Ruth and her family. Fred S. Zeidman, Chair Sara J. Bloomfield, Director
