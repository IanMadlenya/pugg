A native New Yorker, he attended Townsend Harris High School and City College, where he won many international fencing competitions and is listed in the City College Athletic Hall of Fame. Gerald served in the U.S. Army Intelligence in WWII as a Japanese interpreter with Merrill's Marauders in the Burma theater of operations. In civilian life, he was a professional violinist and Concert Master with major symphony orchestras. He was a co-founder of Discount Records, a nationwide chain of retail record stores. In recent years, he was on the board of the Maverick Concert series in Woodstock, NY.

He is survived by his three children, musicians Antony and Adam and Dr. Juliet Widoff, Juliet's partner Jacqueline Woodson, his granddaughter Toshi, two sisters, Dr. Judith Greenberg and Libby Saines, and his longtime and devoted companion Adrienne Owen. An informal celebration of his life will be held Saturday, November 22, at 2 PM at 228 Meads Mountain Rd., Woodstock, NY. For directions, call Adam at 917602-4397.

        WIDOFF--Gerald. Maverick Concerts mourns the loss of Board Member and former Chairman, Gerald Widoff. His participation in the evolution of Maverick Concerts was invaluable. He was a brilliant human being and artist, an inspiration to his family and loved ones. The classical music realm is diminished immeasurably.
