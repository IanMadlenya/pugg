        GREEN-Adolph. The Board and staff of Carnegie Hall mourn the passing of Adolph Green, who typified the joie de vivre of creation and performance of American music in this hall and so many others. In 1943-44, he and others created ''On The Town'' in a Carnegie Hall studio rented to Leonard Bernstein, and he made the first of his 15 appearances on the Carnegie Hall stage, where he last honored us two years ago, at Isaac Stern's 80th birthday celebration. His close friendship with Isaac Stern was a constant support in the rescue and resuscitation of this building, and he mourned Isaac's passing with us a year ago. We will miss his huge smile, his comraderie, and his ''dignity . . . always dignity.'' We extend condolences to Phyllis, Adam and Amanda, and to Betty, his collaborator of a lifetime. Sanford I. Weill, Chairman Robert Harth, Executive & Artistic Director
        GREEN-Adolph. The Board and staff of The Eye-Bank for Sight Restoration extend their condolences to the family of Adolph Green. He, with his collaborator, Betty Comden, was a great supporter of the Eye-Bank and its efforts to restore sight through eye donation. His legendary talents and generosity will be greatly missed.
        GREEN-Adolph. An abrupt close, too soon, to an exciting life. We'll miss him. Loving thoughts to Phyllis, Adam, Amanda and Betty. Floria Lasky and Jere Couture
