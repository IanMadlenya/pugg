        BERLE-Milton. The Officers, Governors and Members of The New York Friars Club deeply mourn the loss of their beloved Abbot Emeritus, Milton Berle. To the world he was Mr. Television, but to the Friars, he was a friend who touched our lives, not only with his comedy, but also through his personal guidance. He singlehandedly assured the revival of the Club in the 1950s and was fierce in his dedication and continued support of humanitarian causes. He helped us preserve the rich theatrical roots of the Friars Club and his name belongs among the legendary and immortal Friars like Jack Benny, George Burns, Enrico Caruso, George M. Cohan, Cary Grant, George Jessel, Joe E. Lewis, Dean Martin, Ed Sullivan, Mike Todd and Frank Sinatra. And like them he shared a legacy of commitment to the very best. We are honored and proud to have been touched by the legend that will always be Milton Berle. Alan King, Abbot Freddie Roman, Dean Sally Jessy Raphael, Prior Stewie Stone, Scribe Fred C. Klein, Treasurer Jean-Pierre Trebot, Executive Director
