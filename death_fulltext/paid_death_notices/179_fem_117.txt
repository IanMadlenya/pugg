        DISPONZIO-Ann. On Sunday, December 16, 2001 at age 77. She was a woman of warmth, generosity and love. Born to Italian immigrants, she rode the tide of her generation to a successful career without every compromising her devotion to family and friends. Founder of Disponzio Queens Lawyer Service, she was honored by Borough President Claire Shulman last March for her five decades of service to the New York legal community. But, her real joy was shopping and cooking. Holidays were gift-filled, joyous and delicious. Beloved by hundreds, none more so than her family who include her husband of 57 years, John, daughter Louise, son Joseph, granddaughters Eleni and Anna, great granddaughter Leena and her brother Dan and sister Rose.
