        SPITZER--Jack J. The Officers, Directors and Staff of The Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany (Claims Conference) mourn the passing of our Vice President, Ambassador Spitzer. For the past thirty years The Claims Conference had the benefit of his wisdom, energy, and experience in service to Holocaust survivors and the lessons of the Shoah. Our hearts go out to Charlotte, the children, grandchildren, and the entire Spitzer family.
