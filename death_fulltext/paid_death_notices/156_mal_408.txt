        BACHMANN-Louis, Jr. My fellow members of the Board of Trustees of the Bachmann Strauss Dystonia & Parkinson Foundation and I deeply mourn the passing of my father, one of our founding members. He inspired me to start fund raising eight years ago for the dystonia cause with the commencement of an annual golf tournament, since renamed The Hedi Kravis Ruger Memorial Tournament. He proudly served as the tournament's Honorary Chairman. He further provided me with the impetus to establish the Foundation at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in NYC in order to search for a cure and improve public awareness for dystonia and Parkinson's disease. He left a legacy of philanthropy and selfless concern for others. We will sorely miss his inspiration and leadership.
