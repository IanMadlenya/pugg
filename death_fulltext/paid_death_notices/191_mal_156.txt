        BOGARD-Bruce, M.D. The Long Island Jewish Medical Center Staff Society sadly records the untimely passing of our irreplaceable friend and colleague, Dr. Bruce Bogard. He was an extraordinary, selfless, devoted pediatrician and teacher, with unparalleled expertise in the areas of child abuse and learning disabilities. He remains forever in the hearts and minds of the students, patients, parents and colleagues who loved him. May his family be comforted by his legacy.
