        FRICK--Henry Clay II. The Board of Trustees and staff of The Frick Collection are deeply saddened by the death of our distinguished Emeritus President, grandson of our founder, and leader for more than 50 years, Henry Clay Frick II. Clay was elected to the Board in January 1953, was elected Vice President of the Board in 1961, and took over the presidency in 1965, when his father relinquished it a few months before his death. Clay played a critical guiding role for the institution, serving as President for 35 years, overseeing the expansion of the building, the stabilization of its finances, and the acquisition of several major works of art. His tenure spanned the services of five directors with whom he worked to make this an ever more remarkable institution. Our hearts go out to his wife Pemmy Frick, also a Trustee, and to the entire Frick family. Margot C. Bogert, President Anne L. Poulet, Director
