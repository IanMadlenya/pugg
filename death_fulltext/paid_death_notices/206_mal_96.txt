        WOLF--Ephraim, Rabbi, Dr. The Great Neck Synagogue community mourns the loss of our beloved Rabbi Emeritus, Ephraim Wolf. Rabbi Wolf was the founder of the modern orthodox community in Great Neck and served as its leader for more than 30 years. It was his vision that enabled our community and synagogue to grow and prosper. Rabbi Wolf was instrumental in the establishment of the North Shore Hebrew Academy providing a Torah education for the children of Great Neck and neighboring communities. The Great Neck synagogue embodies a sense of family, community, warmth, compassion and friendship. This was Rabbi Wolf's legacy to our community. We extend our most heartfelt condolences to his wife Elaine, his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Dale Polakoff, Rabbi Norman Fisher, President
