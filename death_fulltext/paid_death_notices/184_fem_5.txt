        ARMSTRONG-Dr. Christine Megan, 50, died April 28, 2002, at Presbyterian Village, Austell, GA. Christine will be remembered with great love and affection by her family and friends. Her death was the result of a long, courageous and dignified battle with brain cancer, which was diagnosed and treated in 1986. She was an inspiration. Dr. Armstrong was born on December 4, 1951, and graduated from Rye Country Day School in Rye, NY, in 1969. Christine was a fine scholar, having graduated with honors from Duke University in 1973. She enrolled in the Doctoral program in Art History at Princeton University. Christine's 1989 Doctoral dissertation, The Moralizing Prints of Cornelius Anthonisz, was considered a definitive work on the prints of Cornelius Anthonisz, a Dutch printmaker in the 1500's. It was published by Princeton University Press in 1990. Her career took her to Sotheby's PB 84 auction house and the Philadelphia Art Museum as a print curator. In the 1985-86 academic year, she became an assistant professor of Art History at the College of Wooster in Wooster, Ohio.
