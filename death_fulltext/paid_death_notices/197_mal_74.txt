        CRANEFIELD--Paul F. The Rockefeller University community mourns with deep sadness the loss of our distinguished colleague and beloved friend, Paul F. Cranefield. Professor Cranefield, a valued member of The Rockefeller University research community for more than 35 years was a pioneer in the study of cardiac physiology. His research was directed toward a deeper understanding of cardiac arrhythmias and their relation to heart disease. His activities as a medical historian were a reflection and extension of his research interests. He will long be remembered for his contributions to the scientific understanding of cardiac physiology and pharmacology, as well as for his deep commitment and skill as a teacher. Dr. Cranefield will be profoundly missed. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his family and colleagues. Thomas P. Sakmar, Acting President Richard B. Fisher, Chairman, Board of Trustees David Rockefeller, Honorary Chairman and Life Trustee, Board of Trustees >>AD#
