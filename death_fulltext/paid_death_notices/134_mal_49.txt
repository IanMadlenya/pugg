        FRIENDLY-Fred W. We mourn the passing of a great journalist, educator, and citizen who dedicated his life to the principles of a free and responsible press operating in the public interest. Through his students and his Seminars on Media and Society on public television, he leaves a legacy of knowledge and understanding of the First Amendment, the Constitution, and the ideals that inspire great journalism and the nation. We salute the man who served so well this University, the Graduate School of Journalism, and the pursuit of truth in a free society.

        FRIENDLY-Fred. In memory of the inspirational man who filled many roles in our lives-from surrogate father to advisor to admired client. Fred conveyed the true meaning of ethics to all audiences he addressed and to all who knew him. We will always remember him for the ideals he communicated that helped shape our lives. To Lisa, Ruth and the entire family we extend our deepest sympathies. Susan and Daniel Stern
