        WINANS--Charles. For a generation of students at Brooklyn Prep, he was a dazzling teacher, a wise mentor, a guide to parts unknown, and an insightful mystic. To us, he was simply and always ''Charlie'', and forever the name and the thought of him will conjure for us the noblest aspects of life. The embodiment of the ideal of the great Jesuit tradition, Charlie will be missed by us all, even as we feel his presence always in our lives. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and with the Jesuit community that so lovingly sustained his magnificent spirit in the last year of his lifeHis Brookyn Prep Students.
