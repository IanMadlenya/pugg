        STEVENS--Alyce. Kips Bay Boys & Girls Club deeply mourns the passing of Mrs. William H. (Alyce) Stevens, Jr. in Florida on January 23. Alyce was a longtime member of the Women's Committee, and a founding member of the Kips Bay Boys & Girls Club Decorator Show House in 1973. That first year the Show House Journal was assembled on Alyce's bed. Inspired amateurs had created one of New York City's most enduring and successful charitable events. The Journal remained her special project for the next 25 years. Godspeed, dear Alyce.
