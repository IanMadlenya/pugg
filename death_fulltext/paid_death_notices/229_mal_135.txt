        TAYLOR--Hunt. Beloved husband of Martha & father of Julia (17) and Davis (13) died in a motorcycle accident while on vacation in Arizona on February 5, 2006. Hunt Taylor lived his life and loved his family ''with all his might,'' which were his last words to a close family friend. His love of life and his intelligence, kindness and humor are a small part of the legacy he leaves behind for his hundreds of friends. He was a valued member of the hedge fund industry and a brilliant musician. He will be sorely missed by many. A private service will be held for the family and closest friends on Sunday, February 12, 2006 at the Graham Funeral Home, 1036 Post Road, Rye, NY. (914) 967-0129. Visitation will be from 11AM until 2 PM. The service will be held at 2 PM. There will be a celebration of the life that he lived to the fullest to be held at a date yet to be announced.
