        FELDMAN-Melvin. Unexpectedly on January 22, 2003. Remembered with love and affection by his family and friends, daughter, Estey, son, Ronald, sister, Ruth, son-inlaw, Doug, and nephews, Clifford and Bruce, and their families. He was kind, gentle and giving. Melvin and Yetta will be together. God speed.
