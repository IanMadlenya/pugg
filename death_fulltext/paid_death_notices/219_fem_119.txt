        HICKMAN--Minnie Cassatt. There is no adequate way to honor Minnie Cassatt Hickman, 73, who passed peacefully on April 10, 2005. She lives on through her three daughters, Mimi, Mary, and Rosie; her six grandchildren; and the many students she mentored in her years teaching at The Lenox School. Her generosity, kind spirit, and wit will be missed by all who knew and loved her. A memorial service will be held on April 29th, at St. Thomas on 5th Avenue, at 4 pm. The family requests that, in lieu of flowers, donations be made to the Intensive Care Unit of the Good Samaritan Hospital of West Palm Beach, FL.
