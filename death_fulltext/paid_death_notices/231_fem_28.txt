        FELDMAN - Carol. With deepest sadness, I announce the death of my beloved wife, Carol Feldman. She died in Rome on March 18 following unsuccessful surgery to alleviate a long-standing and painful abdominal condition. She was much loved, and she helped create a new field of research relating the development of the human mind to the culture in which it grows. Her loss leaves us all poorer--personally, intellectually, morally. Jerome Bruner
