        KAHN--Martha. A much loved aunt of Jeffrey, Andrew, Heather and Heller Goldberg lost her battle with breast cancer Wednesday evening. She is also survived by her two great-nieces and great-nephew Reede, Shelby, and Theodore Goldberg; and her sister-in-law Mindy Kahn Goldberg. We love her and she will be greatly missed.
