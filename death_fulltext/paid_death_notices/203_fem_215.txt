        STEVENSON -- Isabelle Lu bow. The Board, staff and members of the Alliance of Resident Theatres/New York (A.R.T./New York), mourn the passing of Isabelle Stevenson, Chairman of the American Theater Wing. A great lady of the theater, Isabelle was a true benefactor, working on behalf of the theater and in the service of thousands of actors, directors, playwrights, designers, theater companies, producers, and above all--audiences--for more than 60 years. Our deepest condolences go to her daughters, Susan Brown and Laura Maslon, her niece Francine Ringold-Johnson, and their families, as well as the Board and staff of the American Theater Wing.
