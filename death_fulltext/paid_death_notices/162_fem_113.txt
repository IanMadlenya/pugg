        DELANY-Willetta S. Age 93 on July 13, 2000. Beloved wife of her late husband, Judge Hubert T. Delany. Dear and cherished mother of Professor Madelon Delany Stent and Dr. Harry M. Delany. Sister of Ernest Smith of Yonkers, NY. She will be sorely missed by a host of nieces, nephews, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and other relatives and friends. Hers was a life of courage and commitment to the thousands of black and Puerto Rican children in need of adoption who in her own words ''were forced to spend their formative years in hospitals, shelters, institutions and boarding homes''. Willeta Delany was one of the earliest African-American women on the Board of Spence-Chapin Adoption Services. As President of ''Adopt-A-Child'', an interracial interface program of 14 public and private agencies which came together to find homes for Negro and Puerto Rican children of that day needing adoption, she played a vital role in organizing forums and interstate conferences to discuss the inequities and unique issues related to their adoption. She was active for many years with the Harlem YWCA and numerous civic organizations. Visitation will be Wednesday at Benta's Funeral Home, 630 St. Nicholas Ave., between 1-8 PM. Funeral Services will be Thursday, July 20, 10 AM at St. Luke Episcopal Church, Convent Ave. at 141 St.
        DELANY-Willetta S. The Directors and staff of Spence-Chapin Services to Families and Children acknowledge with great sadness the passing of Mrs. Delany, a Board Member from 1951 to 1959, who in service to the agency was tireless in her commitment to children and spearheaded the Committee on the Development of Adoption Resources to find adoptive homes for AfricanAmerican infants. We extend heartfelt sympathy to her family and friends. Katharine S. Legg, Exec Director
