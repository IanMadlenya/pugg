        LIPSON--May Fine. Members and candidates of the Institute for Psychoanalytic Training and Research (IPTAR) mourn the loss of our esteemed colleague and friend May Fine Lipson. May was a founder of IPTAR and an active member for nearly 50 years. She touched the lives of so many people as a teacher, elementary school principal and, most especially, as a psychoanalyst. She was a force in psychoanalytic education as a developer of a then innovative curriculum. Our condolences to her husband Moses, daughter Ellyn, son-in-law Les, and grandchildren Joshua and Cory. Funeral services Wednesday August 9 at noon at Plaza Funeral Home (Amsterdam Ave. at 91st St.). Shiva calls at 225 West 86th St, Apt. #
