        SANTOIANNI--John Blaise. On July 15, 2005, St Vincent's Hospital, NYC. We deeply mourn the loss of our cherished John. John's vibrant and extraodinary spirit-his ability to engage, enchant, connect and comfort-touched everyone he knew on the most profound level. Beloved agent in the NY theatrical and film communities, recognized for his charisma, genial sensitivity and an immediate ability to identify with clients. He spent his most recent years dedicating himself to his own writing. A memorial service will be held Tuesday November 8, 7PM, The Duke on 42nd St, 229 W. 42 St. Contributions to an annual poetry award in Mr. Santoianni's memory can be made to Academy of American Poets, Attn: John B. Santoianni Award for Excellence in Poetry, 584 Broadway #
