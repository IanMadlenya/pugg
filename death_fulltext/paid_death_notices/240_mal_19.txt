        KATZ--Ira. ''Unk'', you will be missed. Sweet dreams. We will always love you. Barbra and Margi $(6$)KATZ--Ira, age 88, long-time resident of Hewlett, NY and Boca Raton, FL died on December 31, 2006 at his home in Hewlett, NY surrounded by his family. Beloved husband of 61 years to Elaine, loving father of Suzi Katz-Roth and Jeffrey (Beth Rogers) Katz, cherished grandfather of Mark (Amanda) Roth, Jason Roth and John Katz. He was born and raised in New York and graduated from New York University in 1939. During World War II, he served in the United States Army, first in North Africa then in the South of Italy. After the war, he, along with his father Philip and brother Howard, started Sherwood Equities, a real estate company that over the years built many single-family homes, apartment houses and industrial buildings across Long Island. His primary devotion, and by far, his most highly valued success, was always his family and his role as its patriarch. His love of family and friends and his wonderful sense of humor will be sorely missed by all. Funeral services will be held at Boulevard-Riverside Chapels at 1450 Broadway, Hewlett, NY on Wednesday, January 3rd at 1:30. $(6$)KATZ--Ira. Dearest friend, we loved you very much and we will forever miss you. Rhoda, Seymour, Marni, Bobby
