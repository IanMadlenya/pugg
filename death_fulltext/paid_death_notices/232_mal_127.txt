        HERRING -- Robert Almer. The Education Legacy Fund of the New York Metropolitan Chapter of the American Society of Interior Designers mourns the loss of one of our brightest lights. Robert was an Honorary Fellow of the Society and a longtime member of the Governing Committee of the Fund. His infectious good humor and positive disposition were a pleasure to experience and an inspiration to those of us with whom he shared his multifaceted passions. He was a gentleman of the finest caliber, a man of unwavering integrity and had such a voice. Robert, it was a privilege to share the adventure with you. It will be our mission to honor your dedication and innumerable contributions and, thus, perhaps, make Interior Design in New York better for our having been the beneficiary of your illuminating presence. We will miss you!
