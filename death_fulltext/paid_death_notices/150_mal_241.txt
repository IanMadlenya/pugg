        CATTON-Eddie. A man of outstanding vision, leadership and integrity-a pillar of the Sephardic community and liaison to the broader Jewish world. The Sephardic Community Center mourns the loss of one of its Founding Fathers and second President whose devotion, dedication, and support provided the strong foundation on which the Center stands. His community involvement included Vice President of the Yeshiva of Flatbush and longtime Chair of UJA-Federation's Syrian Sephardic Campaign. Eddie touched deeply everyone he came in contact with, leaving behind a good name and legacy of generosity throughout the world. The officers, board of directors, staff and membership of the Sephardic Community Center extend our sincere sympathies to his wife, Frieda; his daughter, Rochelle; his daughter and son-in-law, Melanie and Stephen Shalam; his son and daughter-in-law, Sammy and Shirley; his mother and father, Rachel and Sam and his brother and sister-in-law, Harry and Diane. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
