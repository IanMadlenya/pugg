        GELB-Leah. It is with deep sadness and profound respect that the Solomon Schechter School of Westchester community notes the death of its founding principal, Leah Gelb. Leah, in association with her beloved husband, the late Rabbi Max Gelb, nurtured not only a growing school but also a vision of the Jewish community of Westchester. Her love of children, her care for parents, her support of teachers, established the reputation of our school. One of the first graduates of the Teachers Institute of the Jewish Theological Seminary, she was an exemplary professional Jewish educator. We extend our condolences to her children Bernard and Mimi, David and Carol, and her grandchildren Michael, Lauren and Alex. May the memory of the righteous be for a blessing. M. Mac Schwebel, Chairman Board of Trustees James M. Dubin, Vice Chairman Board of Trustees Dr. Elliot D. Spiegel, Headmaster
