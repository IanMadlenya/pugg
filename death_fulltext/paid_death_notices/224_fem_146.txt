        CARR--Mary J., of Camillus, NY, formerly of the Webster on West 34th Street, died peacefully at home on September 17th at the age of 85. Mary was born in New York City on May 9, 1920, the beloved daughter of Edward F. and Mary J. Carr (both deceased). The family moved to Syracuse in 1924. She was valedictorian of the 1937 class of Onondaga Valley Academy, graduated from St. Lawrence University in 1941 and Syracuse University Law School in 1944. Mary began her long career as an attorney with Hancock, Dorr, Ryan and Shove Law Firm in Syracuse. Upon relocating to New York City, she was employed by Mendes and Mount for 10 years and then the City of New York Human Services Administration until she retired at the age of 75. She returned to the Syracuse area in 1994. She was a member of AFSCME and the New York State Bar Association. After her retirement, she served for six years on the Diocese of Syracuse Commission on Women in Church and Society. She was a communicant of Sacred Heart Church in Manhattan and St. James Church in Syracuse. She will be remembered most fondly for her encyclopedic knowledge, her sparkling wit, her panache in wearing hats and the unique gifts she gave. Mary is survived by her brother, Edward F. Carr, and his wife, Wendy, of Framingham, MA, and two sisters, Norah C. Depperman of DeWitt and Kathryn A. Clark of Camillus, as well as her many nieces and nephews. A funeral mass was held at St. James Church in Syracuse on September 20, 2005. Donations in her memory may be sent to St. James Church, 4845 S. Salina Street, Syracuse, NY 13205.
