        KRIENDLER-H. Peter. Elisabeth Salzhauer Axel's great-uncle by marriage was Peter Kriendler. He was a true and dear uncle to her. The Salzhauers were fortunate in coming to know Pete as a family member. He was a great and wonderful man who lived an enormously good and interesting life. Pete was always fun to be with, and his stories and charm have become part of our good memories. The best and warmest of times could always be had in the company of Pete Kriendler and his wife, Jeanette. We will always remember and miss him. The Salzhauer Family
