        FINGAR--Sol. The Rubin family extends our heartfelt condolences to Debrah, Joseph, Glenn and Richard upon the passing of our dear friend and business associate Sol Fingar. In the many years we shared together, Sol was always a dynamic personality; a man who deeply loved his friends and family; and a man who was always ready to go that extra mile for anyone who needed his help. Sol will be sincerely missed but always well remembered by all of us whose lives he touched. Richard Rubin
