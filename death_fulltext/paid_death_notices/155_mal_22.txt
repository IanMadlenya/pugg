        ADAMS-Joey. The Officers, Governors and Members of The New York Friars are deeply saddened by the passing of our valued and esteemed member, Joey Adams. Joey's quick wit and exuberant manner instantly endeared him to all who met him. If anyone has earned the distinction of being the ''definitive Friar'' it's Joey who penned the Friars bio. HERE'S TO THE FRIARS. Joey will live forever within our hearts and gratefully he has left his impression on the funny bones of Friars everywhere! Alan King, Abbot Freddie Roman, Dean Sally Jessy Raphael, Prior David B. Cornstein, Treasurer Stewie Stone, Scribe Jack L. Green, Dean Emeritus Jean-Pierre Trebot, Exec Director
        ADAMS-Joey. The board and members of the La Guardia Memorial Association mourn the loss of a special favorite of Mayor La Guardia and a founding member of our association. Morton B. Lawrence, Secretary
