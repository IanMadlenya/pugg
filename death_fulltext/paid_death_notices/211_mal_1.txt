In the 70's, to celebrate the Constitution, he founded Convention II, a national program for high school students to debate proposed amendments on the floor of the House. His ''Builders of America'' exhibit of Jewish contributions to America from Columbus to Ellis Island is on permanent exhibit at West Point, and tours nationally including the Cannon Rotunda, House of Representatives. Boris had a unique ability to impact people of all ages and circumstances. Unselfish, and generous, the goodness he shared with his family, friends and the nation will be sorely missed.
