        FUTTER--Victor. The Board of Trustees and the Bank Street College community join together to express our sorrow at the death of Victor Futter. We extend our sincere sympathy to his daughters, Trustee Deborah Futter and former parent and longtime friend Ellen. Perhap Victor's proudest association with this institution was that of beloved grandfather of School for Children students Quentin and Theodore, and alumnae Anne and Elizabeth. Our hearts go out to the entire Futter family, and we wish them strength in this time of sorrow. Augusta Souza Kappner, President Sue Kaplan, Chair of the Board
