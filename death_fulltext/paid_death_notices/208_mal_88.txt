        POOL--J. Lawrence. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University notes with sorrow the death of Dr. J. Lawrence Pool, devoted alumnus, professor emeritus of neurological surgery, and former chairman of neurosurgery. His innovations in neurosurgery included introduction of the microscope in operations on cerebral aneurysms and development of the myeloscope to pinpoint lower spine problems. He also was two-time National Squash Racquets Champion. His generosity to P&S resulted in an endowed professorship in neurosurgery and a new squash court. Contributions in his memory may be sent to the Alumni Office, Columbia University P&S, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032. Gerald D. Fischbach, M.D. Executive Vice President, Columbia University Medical Center Dean, College of Physicians & Surgeons
