A professional artist at the peak of her career with representation with Margulies/Taplin Gallery in Coral Gables, Florida and Woodward Gallery in New York City.

Though the art community is greatly diminished by this loss, her friends, collectors and family derive strength from the memory of her creativity and vitality.
