        RYDER-Irving. Died May 1 at age 78. Survived by the love of his life, his longtime paramour Toby Olkin. Also survived by his beloved children, stepchildren and children-in-law Robert and Jill, Carol and Randy, Phillip and Janice, and Paul; his adored grandchildren Tyler, Benjamin, Rachel and Michael. He'll forever be in our hearts and in our funnybones. Oh, how he made us laugh.
