        YANKAUER -- Mary. The Board of Directors, Staff and Volunteers of The Burden Center For The Aging, note with profound sadness, the loss of Mary Yankauer, our distinguished Founding Executive Director. Her dedication and commitment to the Agency, and to helping others, enhanced the growth of The Burden Center and enriched the lives of so many people. Ms. Yankauer worked tirelessly on behalf of seniors in our community, and was a most determined advocate for needed services and programs. We mourn the passing of a leader who so compassionately reached out to those she served. Funeral arrangements pending. Mary Q. Connelly, Board Chair William J. Dionne, Executive Director
