        KAUFMANN--Christine, ''Chrissy.'' Amazing sister, devoted aunt, and cherished friend of so many in so many places, after a decade of bravely battling the demon of breast cancer, succumbed peacefully Sunday morning, November 7. To the end, surrounded by a steady stream of visitors, she cheerfully played gracious and engaging hostess of festivities. Her generous presence, her adventurous spirit, her endearing independence, and above all her infectious laughter will remain her indelible legacy. And our tribute will be our paler emulation of her exuberant and graceful style of overcoming the inexplicable random vicissitudes confronting any life well lived.
