        den BROEDER-Frederick, who died in New York City on July 8 at the age of 64 made significant and original contributions to the field of 18th-century Roman studies with the first catalogue and exhibition in the US (1973) on the subject, The Academy of Europe: Rome in the 18th Century, for the William Benton Museum of Art, University of Connecticut, where he had become curator after receiving a Ford Fellowship at the Cleveland Museum of Art. He continued to publish important articles that, with his wide-ranging art historical and cultural knowledge and his sensitive and discerning eye, informed his later work as independent scholar, curator and consultant, including the exhibition and catalogue Old Master Drawings from the Collection of Joseph F. McCrindle, for The Art Museum, Princeton University, 1991. In later years he became an avid horseman and had moved recently to Tucson, Arizona.
