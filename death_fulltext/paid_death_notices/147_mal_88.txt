        McMAHON-Philip. The Soldiers', Sailors', Marines' and Airmen's Club are deeply saddened by the death of their esteemed colleague and Board Member, Philip McMahon, after a long illness. He was devoted to the SSMAC, and, in the 1980s, during the influx of women in our Military Services, was a prime mover along with Board Member, Pamela Cole, in the upgrading of quarters for the Club's Servicewomen guests. Philip was one of a kind. His boundless knowledge of fine arts and Far Eastern cultures led to encouragement by his friend, Alan Priest, legendary Curator of Far Eastern Antiquities for the Metropolitan Museum. While Philip's professional reputation for absolute integrity as a pioneer in the rarified world of fine arts appraising soon caused him to be sought after throughout the world, his forte was his enormous capacity for friendship-a trait that was the true measure of the man and which stood him in good stead throughout his lifetime. His friends today encompass all walks and ways of life, which made his association with SSMAC aptly representational. Friends may call from 5 PM to 7 PM at Frank E. Campbell, 81st St. and Madison Avenue, New York, on both Thursday and Friday, April 8 and April 9. Interment with final words will be held at 1 PM at the Obolensky family plot at the Rhinebeck, N.Y. Cemetery on Saturday, April 10th. In lieu of flowers, an offering is requested for the Abbey of Our Lady Melleray, 6500 Melleray Circle, Peosta, Iowa. You are already missed. R.I.P. Ivan Obolensky, President Soldiers', Sailors', Marines' and Airmen's Club
