Haupt Glass Gardens provided a special accessible environment for disabled children and patients, giving serenity and beauty within its gardens. Recognized internationally, the Miracle on East 34th Street, an oasis of peace is the Garden of Enid and her legacy to the children at Rusk. Her generous endowment perpetuates the concept of hospital therapeutic horticulture. Mathew H.M. Lee, M.D. Howard A.
