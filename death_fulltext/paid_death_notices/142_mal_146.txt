        MANSON-Julius J., Ph.D. We are saddened by the loss of our dear friend and President of our Humanist Chapter, Dr. Julius Manson, long associated with social justice and humanitarian causes and the international Esperanto movement. Chapter members will miss this kindly gentleman with his quick smile, his warm wisdom, and his perennial optimism, who presided since 1974 over our speakers program, The Humanist Dialogue. He will be missed also in his role as the American Humanist Association's NGO Representative to the United Nations, where he has for many years been vitally involved in Human Rights issues and matters pertaining to international law. Dr. Manson was long a Labor Negotiator for the New York State Board of Mediation. He lived for awhile in Ankara, while he was advisor to the Turkish Government on Labor Relations. He was a Professor Emeritus at Baruch College. Our thoughts are with his grieving family as we reflect on our memories of this fine gentleman. May they be comforted in some small way to know that he was revered by his friends and fellow chapter members of The Humanist Society of Metropolitan New York. A Memorial Service will be held on Sunday, November 29 at 2 PM at New York Society for Ethical Culture at 2 W. 64 St.
