        TISHMAN--Peggy. The Officers and Board of Directors of The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee are deeply sorrowed by the passing of Peggy Tishman, our esteemed Board member. She was an outstanding communal leader of great honesty, steadfast determination, and boundless energy who, during her long involvement with JDC, demonstrated a profound global concern for those in need. The pioneering accomplishments of this elegant and gracious lady are her proud legacy, while her sense of compassion will continue to inspire us all. We extend our sympathy to her daughter, Pat T. Hall, and to the entire Tishman family. Eugene J. Ribakoff, President Jonathan W. Kolker, Chairman of the Board Steven Schwager, Exec. Vice-President
