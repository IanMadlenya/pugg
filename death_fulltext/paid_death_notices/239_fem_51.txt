        KIRKPATRICK--Jeane J. The Council on Foreign Relations mourns the passing of Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, whose combination of scholarship and courage has left a continuing legacy of fidelity to the highest ideals of national service. A dedicated member of the Council for more than 25 years, Ambassador Kirkpatrick served on the Board of Directors from 1985 to 1994, the last year as vice chair. The Council has been honored by our association with her. We offer our sympathy to her sons, John Evron and Stuart Alan, and other members of her family.
