        CALDWELL - Sarah. New York City Opera mourns the passing of a great American operatic pioneer, as well as a dear friend and colleague. As founding director of the Opera Company of Boston, Miss Caldwell brought innovative repertoire, adventurous productions, and worldclass artists to America. She debuted at New York City Opera in 1973, as director of the New York stage premiere of Henze's ''The Young Lord'' (featuring Sir Rudolf Bing as Sir Edgar); and made her conducting debut here in 1976 with ''The Barber of Seville'', which she also directed, featuring Beverly Sills and Donald Gramm. As director, she gave City Opera a landmark production of ''Ariadne auf Naxos'' in 1973, and both directed and conducted ''Falstaff'' in 1979 with Donald Gramm. Miss Caldwell shared and inspired City Opera's visionary spirit, and we were proud to have had her as a member of our company. Paul Kellogg General Director
