        MAIZELL-Jack. Words cannot express the sadness we feel at the loss of our irreplaceable uncle Jack. Beloved Brother of Henoch, our Dad and Grandpa. We loved his smile, spirit, warmth, intelligence and his wonderful singing with his Brother at the Holiday table. We will love him and treasure his memory forever. The Berne, Maizel and Seeherman Families
