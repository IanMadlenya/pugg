        WOLFF-Blanche. It is with great sorrow that the Touro College Family learned of the passing of Mrs. Blanche Wolff, wife of our dear friend and colleague, the Honorable Lester Wolff, Chairman of the Pacific Community Institute (PCI) of Touro College. Blanche Wolff exemplified the truest form of a ''partner-in-life'' to Lester. She was involved in family, charity and good deeds throughout her lifetime. Blanche epitomized the true mother and wife in Israel-a real Aishes Chayil. We mourn with the entire Wolff Family. May her memory be blessed. Dr. Bernard Lander, President Mark Hasten, Chairman of the Board
