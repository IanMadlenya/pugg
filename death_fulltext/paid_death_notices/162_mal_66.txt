        FOX-Herbert O. Columbia Artists Management Inc. is deeply saddened by the loss of our friend and colleague, Herbert O. Fox, on June 29, 2000. During his fifty-four years with CAMI, Herb Fox served in a number of important positions. At the time of his retirement in 1993, he was Senior Vice President of Columbia Artists Management Inc. and Chairman of Columbia Artists Festivals, the latter of which specialized in the touring of pop, jazz, ethnic, and dance attractions. Herb also served as Chairman of the Board of Community Concerts, and was the founder and first director of another CAMI subsidiary, the Broadway Theatre Alliance, which toured Broadway plays and musicals. Herb's remarkable humor, energy, enthusiasm, and vision were invaluable to CAMI and to the artists and attractions we represent. We remember him with great affection and esteem. Ronald A. Wilford, President And The Board of Directors of Columbia Artists Management Inc
