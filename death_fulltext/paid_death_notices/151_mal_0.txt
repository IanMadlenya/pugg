        BUSCH-Paul L., Dr. The passing of Dr. Paul L. Busch, our friend, advisor and fellow trustee leaves us with sorrow, a deep sense of loss, and sympathy for his family. The Fund will ever be strengthened by his past service, and miss his wisdom, commitment and personal warmth. David Dibner, President and the trustees of The Dibner Fund
