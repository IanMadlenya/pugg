        KOVI-Paul. Everyone at The Four Seasons restaurant is deeply saddened by the death of our friend and mentor, Paul Kovi. A generous man and patient teacher, Mr. Kovi was like a father to us, gently guiding and encouraging us for more than thirty years. He was and will always remain in our hearts as a bon vivant, whose love of life transcended everything he did. From the kitchen to the dining rooms, Mr. Kovi strolled through the restaurant inspiring everyone he met to experience and cherish the very best that life has to offer. In doing so he shared with the world an uncommon dignity and playful sense of humor that will be greatly missed. We feel honored to have known him and lucky to have been a part of his life. We will all miss him dearly. To celebrate his life and share his legacy, we invite you to attend a memorial service in his honor on May 12, at 4 PM, at St. Vincent Ferrer Church, located on Lexington Avenue at 66th Street.
