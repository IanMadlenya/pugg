        KUPFERMAN--Meyer. Sarah Lawrence College notes with sorrow the death of Meyer Kupferman, emeritus member of the music faculty. From 1951 until his retirement in 1993, he was a central figure in the development of the Sarah Lawrence music program, introducing generations of students to music theory and composition and especially to the world of new music improvisation. He was a prolific composer whose work ranged across many genres. His love of music, his spirit, and his intelligence enriched the lives of his students and colleagues. It was a privilege to work with him. We extend our deepest sympathy to his family. Michele Tolela Myers, President Barbara Kaplan, Dean of the College
