        USDAN-Selma G. 75. Passed away unexpectedly December 28, 1999. With overwhelming grief and sadness, we announce the death of our beloved mother and best friend, Selma Goldfein Usdan. She touched all who knew her by her graciousness, keen intelligence and extraordinary degree of competence. Born in, and a lifelong resident of Englewood and Fort Lee, NJ she was an employee of Drexel Burnham Lambert and its successor Burnham Securities, Inc. for the last 34 years. She was the consummate professional. Her outward gentleness, tact and reserve masked a steely determination and ability to deal with all kinds of people who crossed her path. This same determination enabled her to graduate from St. Peter's College at age 59. In addition to her son, Jim, daughter, Adrienne, and daughter-in-law, Lisa, she is survived by cousins, nieces, nephews, and extended family, all of whom respected and loved her. Her death leaves us with a hole in our hearts. Her tastefulness, and appreciation of the fine and performing arts was well known to all who knew her, particularly her love of the opera. Private cremation. Memorial service will be held Tuesday, January 4, at 6 pm at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home, 81st & Madison in Manhattan. Rest in peace, mom. We will love you, cherish your memory and miss you always. In lieu of flowers, please make contributions to U JA/Federation or the Metropolitan Opera Society.
