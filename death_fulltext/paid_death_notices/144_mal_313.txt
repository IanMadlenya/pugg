        BELIN-David W. A rare and tireless Jewish leader, he devoted himself to the vision of Isaiah to make the house of Israel a house of prayer for all people. We were privileged to have worked with him in making that vision a reality. We mourn his loss and extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife Barbara, his children Jim, Tom, Jon, Laurie, and Joy, and his stepchildren Lee and Jenifer, and to all who loved him and miss him. David G. Sacks, President Egon Mayer, Director The Jewish Outreach Institute and the Board of Directors
