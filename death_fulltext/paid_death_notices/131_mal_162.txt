        PRESTON-William Sanford, Jr. 78. Died on Sunday, December 7, at his home in Burlington, VT. Born in 1919, he attended Burlington schools and graduated from the University of Vermont. After serving in the army during World War II, Mr. Preston joined his father in the family's Burlington jewelry business. He was active nationally in the jewelry industry as a pastpresident of the Retail Jewelers of America, chairman of the Jewelers' Conference Group, and a long-time member and past-President of the American Gem Society. In 1974, he was awarded the American Gem Society's Robert M. Shipley Award for exemplifying the high purposes, objectives, and ideals of the Society. Additionally, he served as president of the Jewelers' Vigilance Committee and as a result of his tireless work with the JVC, was appointed to oversee the revision and updating of the Jewelry Trade Practice Rules of the Federal Trade Commission. As was noted in the Jewelers' Circular-Keystone, a trade journal for the industry, in July 1996: ''This revision could not have happened without the incredible dedication and hard work of Vermont jeweler Bill Preston in his role as JVC's point man in the Guides project. In his career Bill won many industry honors but none approaches this crowning achievement. The industry is and always will be in his debt. And so will the millions of consumers who'll benefit from Bill's efforts when they buy a piece of jewelry.'' Mr. Preston is survived by his wife of fifty-four years, Janet Clark Preston; four children, William ''Sandy'' Preston III; Elizabeth ''Betsy'' Preston, Burlington, VT; Suzanne Preston Blier, Cambridge, MA; Wright C. Preston, Richmond, VT; five grandchildren, a sister, Janice P. Stafford, Richmond, VT., and many nieces, nephews and cousins.
