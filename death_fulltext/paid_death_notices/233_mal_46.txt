        PALMER--Edward L. The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn the loss of Edward Palmer, who was elected a Trustee in 1982 and a Trustee Emeritus in 1985. Over those many years, he was a devoted supporter of the Metropolitan, lending his time and wisdom to the evolving needs of the Museum. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife Margaret and to his family. James R. Houghton, Chairman Philippe de Montebello, Director Emily K. Rafferty, President
