        UNGERLEIDER-Peter. The officers, directors and staff of the Dorot Foundation mourn the loss of our President, Peter Ungerleider. Our condolences and sympathy extend to all of his family and friends, and especially to his wife Kathrin, his sister Jeane, and his brothers Andrew and Steven. In the loss of Peter, the Dorot Foundation has lost a warm friend and a bold leader of keen insight, wide knowledge, and deep passion. His sense of social resposibility, his comittment to those unable to help themselves and his support for the needy of our society remain as an on-going witness to a person whose values continue to guide us all. Memorial service in January. Time and place to be announced. Ernest S. Frerichs Execuitive Director
