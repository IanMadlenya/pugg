        MEYER--Hilde. The worldwide family of Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem extends its heartfelt condolences to Mrs. Irma Haas on the loss of her beloved sister. A softspoken and gentle person her smile radiated kindness, warmth, inner beauty and peace of mind. She lived her life fulfilling countless acts of tzedekah and chesed which touched the lives of thousands, thus following the dictum of the Ethics of the Fathers to ''say little but do much''. From the ashes of the Shoah she came to this country where she rebuilt her life together with her late husband, Dr. Nathan Meyer. The people of Jerusalem were blessed to have Mrs. Meyer as a cherished and deeply caring friend. As a Diamond Founder of the Medical Center together with Mrs. Haas, the two worked together side by side generously supporting every event of the American Committee and every facet of the Hospital's work -from the expansion of our synagogue to equipping the Jesselson Heart Center and supporting our Well Baby Nursery and Maternity Department. We will always remember with deep respect and affection this remarkable and special woman. May her memory remain a blessing.
