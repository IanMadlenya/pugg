        DUNCAN-Todd. New York City Opera mourns the passing of our colleague Todd Duncan. Best remembered as the creator of the role of Porgy in Gershwin's Porgy and Bess, he also sang Escamillo and Rigoletto with the City Opera. He was a pioneer in his field and an inspiration to generations of younger artists, both by his example and through his teaching. We are proud to have been part of his distinguished career. We extend our sympathies to his family and his many friends throughout the world. Paul Kellogg General Director
