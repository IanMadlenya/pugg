Her life-long passion in all things educational, her special dedication to the purposes of the university, and her generosity of spirit are evident through her gifts, including a gift to name the Raymond Fogelman Library in honor of her late husband. Her friends at the New School are grateful for her legacy and celebrate her very long and full life. Philip Scaturro, Chairman, Board of Trustees Bob Kerrey, President, New School University
