        ROSEN-Arnold P. The President, Chancellor Emeritus, Boards of Governors and Overseers, faculty, administration and students of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion record with profound sorrow the death of Arnold P. Rosen, generous benefactor and devoted friend of the CollegeInstitute. A member of the Cincinnati Board of Overseers and the Board of Governors for nearly three decades, Mr. Rosen served as a member of the Executive Committee and Treasurer of the Board. As a dedicated member of the Jerusalem Building Committee Mr. Rosen was a driving force behind the building of the Jerusalem campus. Deeply committed to the Mission of the College-Institute Mr. Rosen, an honorary member of the Board maintained close ties with HUC-JIR. We are the richer and the wiser for having shared his life with us. We offer our sincerest condolences to his beloved wife, Muriel, and family whose loss we profoundly share. May the family find comfort together with all those who mourn for Zion and Jerusalem. Rabbi David Ellenson, President Rabbi Alfred Gottschalk, Chancellor Emeritus Rabbi Paul M. Steinberg, Special Assistant to the President Mr. Burton Lehman, Chair Board of Governors
