        KALKER-Leona Ruttenberg of Williamstown, Massachusetts and Boca Raton, Florida, died on March 12, in her 93rd year. The first and last wife of the late Harry Kalker, she was a caring and delightful mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother. In so many ways, her attitudes and perceptions were truly ahead of her time. As an example her views on nutrition anticipated many of today's established ways. She will be long held in cherished memory by her daughter Darce Davis of Rye, New York, her son, Philip Kalker of Williamstown, Massachusetts, grandchildren, Thomas, Jonathan, Jessica, Kathryn, Ginger, Peter, and three great grandchildren. A graveside memorial service is planned for late spring.
