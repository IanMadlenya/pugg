        KENNER--Edythe, died peacefully at home on October 24, 2006. The lights on Broadway and in Bergdorf's and Bloomingdale's will shine a little dimmer with her passing. Edythe Kenner, a lover of life, family, travel and all that New York City has to offer, including its theatres, music and cabaret scene, its museums, art, culture and food, and (especially) its shopping. Ageless, stylish, elegant and strong in mind and spirit are words that only partially describe her. She leaves behind her son, Robert Safron, his wife Lynda, her grandchildren, Casey and Carrie Safron, and a legion of friends too numerous to mention. Funeral services will be private but a memorial service will take place in the near future. Friends may contact the family for details. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to her favorite charities, Mt. Sinai Hospital, the 92nd Street YM/ YWHA, and Town Hall.
