        FOY-John C.W., British World War II veteran and retired Head of English Proofreading in the United Nations Publishing Division, died last Saturday (May 31, 1997) at the age of 78 after a long struggle with lung cancer. He lived in Englewood, New Jersey. Mr Foy served in World War II with the Royal Expeditionary Forces-First Division (Territorial Army). A member of the 53rd Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery, he landed in France in October 1939 and was wounded in 1940 during a German air attack near Lille. He was captured by German forces and held as a POW in Bleicherode, a salt-mining town near Nordhausen in the central region of Thuringen. He was liberated in 1945 by General Patton's Third Army. After the war he returned to his native London, where he worked for the London Times and Odhams Press Ltd. He came to the United States in 1953 to join the United Nations, from which he retired in 1979. A longtime resident of Englewood, Mr. Foy was an avid gardener, a military-history enthusiast, and a soccer aficionado. He is survived by his wife of 40 years, Geraldine F. Foy; his son, John F. Foy of Manhattan; his two daughters, Penelope B. Foy of Merrick, NY, and Jennifer F. Schalhoub of Little Ferry, NJ; a brother, Ronald Foy of London; two sisters, Gladys Jackson and Florence Cook, also of London, and his grandchild, Catherine F. Foy. Mr. Foy often stated that without aid from the British Red Cross Society he would not have survived the long years as a POW. For that reason, and in lieu of flowers, donations may be made in his memory to: National Headquarters of the Red Cross, 17th & E. Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20006. Goodbye, mate. We'll miss you.
