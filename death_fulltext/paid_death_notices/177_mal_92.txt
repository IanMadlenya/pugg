        AISENSTADT-Dr. Andre. The Musicians, Trustees and Staff of the Marlboro Music School and Festival mourn the loss of one of their most enthusiastic and generous friends for over four decades and extend sincere sympathy to his family and friends. A member of the Board of Trustees since 1967, his devotion to Rudolf Serkin and Marlboro's musicians was manifested in many ways including the establishment, with his late wife Nuissia, of a recording studio and the Marlboro Recording Society. He often said that for him Marlboro was not just an institution, but an important humanistic philosophy-an embracing family. He will be remembered as a vital part of that family.
