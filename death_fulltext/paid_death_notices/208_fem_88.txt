        ROSENBERG--Sonia. Dearest Aunt Sunny, your name fit you perfectly. You brought sunshine into my life since I was a little girl, to the lives of the whole family, and all who knew you, with your love, warmth and kindness. I'll remember the special times we spent together in Florida. You praised my charitable work telling me, ''you'll get good marks in Heaven for that''. I know you have more good marks than me, you already have your angel wings. I was blessed to have you in my life. I'll miss you more than I could ever say, you will live in my heart forever. Lovingly, Phyllis
        ROSENBERG--Sonia. Sunny was a woman of distinction, strength, grace, joy and compassion. She was deeply devoted to both family and friends, and she was honored for her leadership, quiet generosity and good works. Our heartfelt sympathy to Susan, Stuart, Darin and Danielle. May her memory be a blessing. The Mandelker/Braiterman Family
