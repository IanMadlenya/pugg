Always there for friends, family and colleagues. He was truly a fashion maven. In the late 1970s, he became our director of Adolfo licensing. He had a zest for living and enjoying the good life with his family and friends. He was crowned with the love and admiration of all who were privileged to know him. No one whose life he touched will be the same without him. We shall surely miss this extraordinary, visionary and special human being. With our love forever, Lee, Linda and Paul Wattenberg
