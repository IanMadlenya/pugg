        CHACE -- James. The Trustees and staff of The New School University mark with sadness the death of James Chace, former editor of World Policy Journal and Senior Fellow Emeritus of The New School's World Policy Institute. Dr. Chace was a leading foreign policy thinker and historian. He was the author of nine books, including the acclaimed biography of Dean Acheson, ''Acheson: The Secretary of State Who Created the American World'' (1999), and his most recent book ''1912: Wilson, Roosevelt, Taft and DebsThe Election That Changed the Country'' (2004). The University has lost a great intellectual and scholar. We extend our sympathy to his family and friends.
