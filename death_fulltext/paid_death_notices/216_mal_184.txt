        SCHULBERG -- Jay. The Board of Directors, Overseers and staff of the International Rescue Committee are saddened by the death of Jay Schulberg, a valued member of our board since 1971. Jay, who was among the most accomplished advertising executives of his generation, was deeply committed to the cause of refugees. In time of refugee crisis, from Bangladesh to Bosnia to Kosovo, Jay used his creative talent to call the world's attention to the injustices he witnessed. We will miss him deeply, and we extend our heartfelt sympathy to his wife Kathy and their loved ones.
