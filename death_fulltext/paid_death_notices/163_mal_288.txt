        KRAINIS-Bernard. Aston Magna's Board of Directors, staff and artists mourn the death of Bernard Krainis. One of its founders, he stepped in at a crucial time to ensure the continuity of the Festival. His warmth, kind spirit and magnificent musicianship will be sorely missed by all who were fortunate enough to have known him and to have heard him perform.
