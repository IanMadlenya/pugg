        SMEAL-Mary Jean. On Thursday, March 12th, Mary Jean Smeal went home to a loving God. The 'music of her years' was a most splendid symphony of caring. Long ago, with her beloved Frank by her side, she responded to the Pauline invitation to the Corinthians-of-old: ''. . .but the greatest of these is Charity.'' And in the wide circle of the suffering whose pain was measurably eased by her caring concern were the legions of 'lost children' charged to the care of Daytop Village. And she shall long be remembered in our grateful prayers. Wordsworth's apostrophe to such a splendid life remains as vivid: ''The music in my heart I bore; long after it was heard no more!'' Our deep sympathies to Frank and the Smeal Family. (Msgr.) William B. O'Brien President Daytop Village, Inc.
