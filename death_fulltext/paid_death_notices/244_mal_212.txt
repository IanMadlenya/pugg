An elegant, energetic and talented architect, he was admired and engaged by the leading figures of his time, Bob Moses, Joe Papp, and the Villages led by Margot Gayle who saved the Jefferson Market Courthouse.

Giorgio served the Municipal Art Society for half a century as a trustee, president and a clear-headed voice of conscience. It's hard to imagine New York without him.
