        BLANK--Myron N. (Mike) of Des Moines, Iowa. Mike's family, friends and community celebrate the life and mourn the passing of this fine gentleman who made such a difference in so many lives. As president of Central States Theatre Corp. Mike operated an influential theater circuit in Iowa and Nebraska for 72 years. During the 1950's he was the largest operator of drive-in theaters in the country at which time he traveled the world as the president and representative of the National Association of Theatre Owners (NATO). After the circuit was sold in 2002, Mike continued to work daily until two weeks prior to his death at the age of 93. During World War II Mike was a commissioned officer in the Navy where he headed the production unit for foreign language training films. His greatest contribution to the people of Iowa was his lifetime of philanthropy. In central Iowa he founded Blank Children's Hospital, the Blank Park Zoo, the IMAX at the new Science Center of Iowa, the Jacqueline N. Blank Bookworks of Planned Parenthood of Greater Iowa, the children's wing at the new Des Moines library, the Steven N. Blank Youth Center of Youth Emergency and Shelter Services, the A.H.

Mike was preceded in death by his wife of 66 years, Jacqueline N. Blank. He is survived by his daughter, Beverly Perry of New York City, eight grandchildren and 13 great grandchildren.
