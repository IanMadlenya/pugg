        DOUGLASS - TORRENCE - Judith Kay. On March 25, 2002. It is with deep sorrow that we note the passing of Judy, beloved wife of Jerry Torrence, at the age of 60. Her immediate cremation followed. Judy is survived by her father, Grover Giesy, and brother, Greg Giesy, both of Eugene, OR. Born and raised in Oregon, she was a graduate of the University of Oregon, School of Architecture, with a degree in Interior Design. Judy was a woman of extraordinary intelligence and taste who lived her life with grace and style. Independent in mind and spirit with a strong sense of fairness and ethics, she arrived in New York City in 1964. In the late 1990s, Judy served as Vice President and Creative Director at Federated Merchandising. Prior to that, she worked at Sears as Product Development and Brand Manager for the Home Fashions Division. Her varied career included management and product development positions at Regal Rugs, Bloomingdale's, Emporium Capwell, B. Altman and Macy's. She also owned her own stores, Douglass & Waters at one time. More recently, Judy operated her own business, Douglass International Designs. A resident of Manhattan, she also maintained a home in Westport, CT. Judy was a seasoned traveler who spoke fluent French and Italian. Her idea of relaxing was another country, a good book, and exploring an archeological site or museum. Her energy, smile, and love of the next adventure are irreplaceable. She will be missed by her many friends around the world. A graveside service will take place at the cemetery in St. Charles, IA. on April 25 at 11 AM. In lieu of flowers, a contribution in her memory may be made to the Connecticut Audubon Society, 2325 Burr Street, Fairfield, CT. 06430.
