        ROSS-Thomas B. The employees of Loral Space & Communications express their deepest sorrow over the death of their dear friend and colleague, Tom Ross. Vice President of Government Relations for Loral since 1995, Tom brought intelligence, style, clear-sightedness, integrity and a wealth of experience to the tasks he performed for the company. In his own words, he ''cobbled together'' a rich and interesting life, with significant stints as a newspaper reporter, an official in the Carter and Clinton administrations, a bestselling author and a corporate public relations officer. An elegant writer and terrific storyteller, Tom was admired and loved by all the employees lucky enough to work with him. He spoke with pride of his wife and three daughters and was delightted to be a grandfather. We join Tom's family and friends in mourning the loss of this wonderful man. He had a great run. Funeral Mass to be held Friday, November 8, at 9 AM, Church of St. Thomas More, 89th and Madison.
