        NICHOLSON--James J. The College of New Rochelle community records with sorrow the death of James J. Nicholson, cherished friend of long-standing, former member of the Board of Trustees and its Chair from 1985 to 1991. Ever the man of wit, warmth and compassion, he stood in the midst of this community for almost three decades as one who served. Wise counselor, guide and leader, he inspired us with a breadth of vision and boldness of action, always imprinted with his characteristic reverence for people. He contributed immeasurably to the advancement of this college, and his friendship has been a great gift. We celebrate his life. Stephen J. Sweeny, Ph.D. President Jean Baptiste Nicholson OSU Ohair, Board of Trustees
