        BEUDERT-Monique. Born Long Island, New York, October 22, 1950. Died peacefully October 9, 1999, London, England, age 48. Beloved wife of Brian Boylan of London. Cherished daughter of Adele Beudert and the late Francis Beudert of Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island; sister of Martine Beudert of Brooklyn, Michele Richard of Old Greenwich, Connecticut, and Claude Beudert of East Hampton; stepmother of Grace and Serena Boylan of London. Studied art history at Connecticut College (B.A. 1972) and Hunter College, CUNY, New York. Worked briefly for Pace Gallery, New York, before joining the staff of The Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1973 in the Office of the Registrar. Held a curatorial position in MoMA's Department of Painting and Sculpture from 1976 to 1984. Curator and Adviser, Paine Webber Art Collection, 1984 to 1993. Associate Curator, Tate Gallery, London, 1994 to 1999. A respected curator with a discriminating eye and an unusual sensitivity to artists and collectors-one for whom the artist and the work of art always took precedence. A voracious and insightful reader whose contributions to not one, but two New York reading groups will be greatly missed. An exceptional individual whose warmth, intelligence, humor, style, and quiet sense of purpose were widely admired in New York, London, and wherever she traveled. She brought joy to many, and her capacity for friendship will always be remembered by those who were close to her. A memorial service will be held in London in November. Donations in her memory may be sent to: Monique Beudert Fund, Studio in a School Association, Inc., 410 West 59th Street, New York, NY 10019. Contributions will be used to provide art supplies for children.
