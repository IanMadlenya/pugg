        MICHEL-Henry L. The Civil Engineering Research Foundation (CERF) is deeply saddened by the loss of one of its founding fathers Henry L. Michel. Henry's tremendous vision and leadership were instrumental in founding CERF in 1989 and he served as Chairman for five years. His many years of unselfish dedication and commitment to CERF made him a cherished friend and mentor. In 1996 CERF proudly established the Henry L. Michel Award for Industry Advancement of Research. This award served to recognize industry leaders who emulate the extraordinary qualities that Henry possessed. The CERF Board and Staff extend its heartfelt sympathy to Henry's wife, daughters and family. We will miss his special friendship and visionary guidance. Harvey M. Bernstein President and CEO
