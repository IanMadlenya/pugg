        GEFFEN-Rabbi Samuel. We mourn with deep sorrow the passing of our beloved Rabbi and spiritual leader of the past 47 years. He was an inspiring man of God who taught our children and our grandchildren in our Religious School including almost 2000 Bar Mitzvah and Bat Mitzvah students. He was devoted to every facet of our Synagogue including the Daily Minyan, and led our Sabbath and Festival and High Holy Day Services with his full strength and vigor throughout those years. After more than four decades of dedication, he retired and became our Rabbi Emeritus until his passing. He also found time for many years as President of The Queens Council for Soviet Jewry, and was an organizer of the Interfaith Council in our community, where he led religious services with members of other faiths. We offer sincere condolences to his dear wife Ruth; son Peter; brother Dr. Abraham; sisters Dessie Wilensky and Helen Ziff and three grandchildren. Nathan Gittleman, President Jewish Center Of Forest Hills West
