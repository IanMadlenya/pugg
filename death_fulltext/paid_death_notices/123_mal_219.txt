        WIRTH-Gunther. The Officers, Directors and Members of the Club Managers of the City of New York sadly announce the death of our friend and colleague. For many years, Gunther devoted himself, unselfishly, to the interests of club management. To all of us in the industry, he was and always will be an idol. The example he set will long continue to influence and inspire us. It is difficult indeed to find the words to express our regret at the death of this splendid man. To the family of Gunther Wirth, please accept for yourself, and all who mourn with you, our assurance of heartfelt sympathy.
