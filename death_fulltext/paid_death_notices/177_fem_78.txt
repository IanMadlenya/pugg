        PENDLER-Betty. The Board of Directors, staff, participants and friends of the Association for the Help of Retarded Children, NYC Chapter, mourn the passing of Betty Pendler, a good friend, a former member of the Board of Directors and professional.

A memorial service will be held on October 21 at 1 P.M. at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 76th Street & Amsterdam Ave. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the AHRC Foundation in Betty's memory. 212-780-2690.
