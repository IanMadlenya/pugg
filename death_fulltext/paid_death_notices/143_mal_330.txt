        SCHUR-Jerry A. Of Lake Worth, FL, formerly of Long Beach, NY, on December 24, at 92. Loving husband of Laura. Devoted father of Matthew and Henry. Adoring grandpa of Jennifer. Educator and mentor at Stuyvesant High School and Hofstra University for half of the 20th Century. His nurturing loosed the facile minds and fertile imaginations of generations of his students, two of whom have already won Nobel Prizes, upon the world. His generosity, humor and insight have enriched the lives of all those fortunate enough to have been touched by him.
