        BOGERT-Margaret Milbank. The Board and staff of The JM Foundation and Milbank Foundation for Rehabilitation express their deepest sorrow at the loss of Margaret Milbank Bogert, who died Wednesday, September 11 at New York Hospital. We offer our heartfelt condolences to the Bogert and Milbank families, to Mrs. Bogert's countless friends across the country, and to her colleagues at the many charitable organizations she served so selflessly. Mrs. Bogert was more than a Vice President, Member, and Director of the Foundations; she was an inspiration to each of us. As the daughter of our Founder, Jeremiah Milbank, Sr., she embodied the spirit of caring and commitment she inherited from the father she so loved and admired. We pray that Margie is at peace with her beloved husband of 52 years, H. Lawrence Bogert, who died in 1992. We mourn her passing and pledge that her spirit will guide our work at The JM Foundation and Milbank Foundation for Rehabilitation.
