Shulman, who is the founder of Daffy's, Inc., the loving mother to, Marcia, Dr. Robert, and Michael, and cherished grandmother of eight, Joshua, Gabriel, Damon, Evan, Gabriel, Zoe, Davy, and Hannah. Born in Toronto, Canada, she studied at the Toronto Conservatory of Music and was an Oakwood Collegiate Pianist. Shirley was honored by, and performed for Sir Ernest McMillian and studied with Viggo Kihl and Grace Gilles. She loved music, the arts, languages and humor, supporting the Carnegie Hall Foundation and the Foundation for the Blind, but her greatest source of pride were her three children. Her philosophy can best be expressed by Oscar Wilde's observation, ''Life is too important to be taken seriously.''
