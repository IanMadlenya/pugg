        HERZOG-Chaim. We mourn the passing of our dear friend, Chaim Herzog, sixth President of the State of Israel, Ambassador to the United Nations, head of the Israeli Military Intelligence and General in the Israel Army, who not only lived through a historic period in world history-but helped to create it. As the son of Isaac Halevy Herzog, first Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of the State of Israel, he received a thorough religious and secular education starting with the Hebron Yeshiva through the Wesley College in Dublin, the Government of Palestine Law School in Jerusalem and London and Cambridge Universities. Although he received many awards as co-author of more than six books, liberator of the victims of Nazi concentration camps while serving as officer in the British Armed Forces and honored by both branches of the U.S. Congress-In recent years he was most proud of the establishment of the Chaim Herzog Center for Middle East Studies & Diplomacy at the Ben Gurion University in the Negev-he served as a distinguished member on the Board of Directors of our Slim Fast Foods Companies for many years as a colleague of the greatest reliability, a loyal associate and an important factor in the success of a number of our business decisions. President Chaim Herzog brought a great sense of dignity and respect to the Jews throughout the world in general, and the citizens in Israel in particular because of his intellect, warmth, and his profound feeling of love and understanding for all members of the human race throughout the world. May the ''Almighty'' comfort his wife, Aura, his children and grandchildren among the bereaved people of Zion and Jerusalem and may his memory serve as a beacon of light to guide them all in the years ahead. S. Daniel Abraham, Chairman of the Board Dr. Edward L. Steinberg, Vice Chairman of the Board Slim Fast Foods Company
