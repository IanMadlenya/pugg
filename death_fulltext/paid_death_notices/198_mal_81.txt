        DENTON--John Ward. Died July 5th, 2003 after a brief illness at the age of 42. He was a prominent member of the Ralph Lauren Design Department for over 10 years before starting Denton & Gardner Limited in 1995. After working as an interior designer in Paris and London, he opened his first store in Soho, NY in August 2001 and his second store in Bridgehampton, NY in April 2003. He is survived by his sister Nancy Poorman, his devoted partner of 15 years Christopher Gardner, and his beloved dog, Peter. To acknowledge all the joy Peter has brought him, it is suggested that memorial donations be sent to Peter's shelter, The Center for Animal Care and Control, 11 Park Place, Room 805, New York, NY 10007. His kindness, wit and passion for style and design inspired all who crossed his path. We all grieve the inconceivable loss of a true original. >>AD#
