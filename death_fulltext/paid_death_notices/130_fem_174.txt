        BELSON-Kathy (Plaszner). A gracious and talented lady who knew far too much pain in her eight year struggle with cancer. We are everlastingly grateful to her friends and associates for their caring devotion and love to Kathy and her daughter Jackie and son Jonathan. May Kathy finally experience the peace and comfort that was denied to her in these last pain filled months. Maxine and Jerome Belson.
