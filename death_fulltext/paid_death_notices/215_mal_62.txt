        RIVLIN--Moshe. The National Board of Hadassah, WZOA, mourns the loss of Moshe Rivlin, one of the great 20th century leaders of the Jewish people. As the scion of a renowned pioneering family he served Israel in many national and international bodies. He was a true Zionist, a statesman and a loyal friend of Hadassah. Our heartfelt condolences go to the entire family. May his memory be for a blessing. June Walker, Nat'l President
