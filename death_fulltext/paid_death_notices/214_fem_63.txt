        LOUIS--Trudy. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) mourn the loss of our cherished and devoted friend Trudy Louis of Los Angeles. Mrs. Louis was a member of the national Board of Directors and of the Southern California Chapter executive board. She was actively involved with the chapter for three decades and was instrumental in its growth. A recognized philanthropist committed to many Jewish causes, Mrs. Louis and her late husband, Norman, became Technion Guardians, reaching the highest level of support for the ATS, Technion and Israel. They generously supported many Southern California Chapter projects and established the Norman and Trudy Louis Chair in Materials Engineering. Mrs. Louis was a recipient of the Albert Einstein Award, the highest honor bestowed by the ATS, and of a Technion honorary fellowship. She was an honorary member of the Technion International Board of Governors. We extend our sincere condolences to her children, Jerry and Jeffrey Louis; brother, Harvey Mandel; and the entire Louis family. The American Society for Technion-Israel Institute of Technology Stephen A. Laser, President Evelyn Berger, Chairman, Board of Directors Melvyn H. Bloom, Executive Vice President Edie Fischer, Western Region President Nina Sabban, Southern California Chapter President Joan Seidel, Southern California Chapter Chair Diane Siegel, Western Region Director
