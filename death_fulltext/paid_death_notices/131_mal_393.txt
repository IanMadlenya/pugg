        MILLS-Arthur. The Board, Volunteers, and Friends of Early Stages deeply mourn the passing of our beloved Arthur Mills. Through Arthur's commitment to young people and to the performing arts, he created Early Stages as a program of the Mayor's Office. The program continues Arthur's dream to give opportunities for many thousands of children to experience live performances, often for the first time. Arthur's remarkable courage, fortitude and spirit will always be remembered and cherished. Our sincere sympathy to his family, colleagues and many friends. Early Stages
