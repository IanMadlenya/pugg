        SAMUELS--Richard Z. June 7, 2004, of Lynchburg, VA. We have lost our very loyal, loved, and loving cousin, whose youth was spent in Bayonne, NJ. He was to my late brother, Norman, and myself, as much a brother as a cousin. The contributions of Dick and his wife, Dorothy Nan, to their community is a wonderful legacy for their children and grandchildren. Marcia and Lewis Ripps
