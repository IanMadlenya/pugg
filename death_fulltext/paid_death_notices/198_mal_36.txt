        HALABY--Najeeb E. The Board of Trustees of the American University of Beirut and members of the AUB community note with great sadness the passing of our friend Najeeb E. Halaby, Trustee Emeritus and former Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the University. We are deeply grateful to ''Jeeb'' for his inspired leadership of AUB during the gravest years of war in Lebanon. His abiding commitment to the humanitarian mission of the institution, and to its role as an international bridge of understanding between East and West, was instrumental in assuring its continuing place as a leading center of learning in service to the people of the Middle East. We offer our heartfelt sympathy to his wife Libby Cater Halaby and children, Queen Noor Al - Hussein, Christian Halaby and Alexa Halaby. Richard A. Debs, Chairman of the Board of Trustees American University of Beirut >>AD#
