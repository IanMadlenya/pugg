        COLODNER-Patricia M., 39, on September 11, 2001. Beloved wife of our dear friend and partner, William H. Colodner, as a result of the heinous attack on the World Trade Center where she worked for Marsh, Inc. Born and raised in Honolulu, she and Warren recently celebrated their 11th Anniversary with their two children, Colby and Jordan and with Warren's children, Courtney and Gregory. It is impossible to convey adequately Patti's love and devotion to her family or their's for her. They will carry her with them throughout their lives, an enduring monument to her young life's efforts. Words cannot express the depth of our sympathy and concern for Warren, Colby and Jordan and the rest of Warren and Patti's family. All who know him know Warren's strength of character and unqualified love for his children. In their terrible loss they will be consoled, guided and cared for by a deeply devoted father. Patti, Warren, their children, family and friends are in our thoughts and prayers. Kirkpatrick and Lockhart LLP
