        GARDNER-Douglas B. It is with profound sadness and a sense of utter despair that the Educational Alliance notes the tragic and unconscionable loss of our Trustee, Douglas Gardner, on September 11, 2001. Doug supported the Alliance's annual benefits and fundraising events and sports programs for our City's teams. We offer solace and sympathy to his loving family. Richard A. Cantor, President Robin Bernstein, Exec. Dir.
