        FALIK-Leon A., M.D. Tribute to the Danes and Other Rescuers mourns with profound sadness the death of Dr. Leon A. Falik, our President. Tribute to the Danes and Other Rescuers was founded in 1966 by two survivors of the Holocaust, one of whom was Dr. Leon A. Falik, a practicing obstetrician and gynecologist. Dr. Falik assumed the Presidency in 1974 and remained in this position until his death. For over three decades, Dr. Falik worked to preserve the memory of the righteous rescuers. His untiring efforts were testimony to his strong belief that education and understanding of the Holocaust are essential in the struggle against prejudice and bigotry. Dr. Falik's commitment and devoted leadership helped sustain the work of the organization through these years. His keen intellect, compassion and concern for human values were an inspiration to all. We extend deepest sympathy to his wife, Ruth, also a member of the organization, and his children and grandchildren. Funeral services will be held on Thursday, December 9, 1:15 PM at Riverside Chapel, 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. Joan Shapiro, Director of Educational Programs
