        McINTOSH - Millicent. Barnard College remembers with pride and gratitude the leadership and friendship of Millicent Carey McIntosh, who served as Dean and then President from 1947 to 1962. She urged generations of students to fulfill their dreams in their personal, professional and civic livesand was herself the best possible example. The College still bears the imprint of her values, her ideals and her insistence that women need not be limited in their aspirations. Barnard College extends its sympathy to the McIntosh family. A memorial service is being planned at Barnard for a future date. Judith Shapiro, President of Barnard College
        McINTOSH-Millicent. The Class of 1962 mourns the loss of our extraordinary President, Millicent Carey McIntosh. She graduated from her presidency in 1962, the year we graduated from our studies, and remained an honorary member of our Class. Her example and encouragement led us to dare new directions and achievements. We will miss her. The Officers of Barnard Class of 1962
