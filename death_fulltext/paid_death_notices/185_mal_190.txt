The Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation expresses its deepest sympathy to the friends and family of Holly Solomon, a true pioneer in the visual arts who was an early supporter of Robert Mapplethorpe's works and who provided him with one of his earliest and most important exhibitions. Her vision made a great contribution to the world of fine art photography and contemporary art. Michael Ward Stout President
