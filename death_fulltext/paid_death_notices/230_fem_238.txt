        STEINHARDT--Jean Stettheimer. A consistent and significant contributor to many Santa Barbara charities and organizations, Jean Stettheimer Steinhardt passed away on Saturday, March 25. She was the daughter of the late Florence and Walter Stettheimer of Atherton, CA, the sister of the late Barbara S. Adler and the sister-in-law of the late Major General Julius Ochs Adler, Vice President and General Manager of The New York Times, both of New York City. Mrs. Steinhardt lived her later years at the Casa Dorinda in Montecito, CA. Jean was a quiet force in making public and private gifts with a definite plan and a strong sense that such were her responsibilities. She did not seek public recognition but would have wanted to be remembered as a person who made a positive difference. Jean had a zest for life and leaves a legacy of wisdom, of strong conviction and of resolute character. She always cared and taught by example that life could be a blend of social concern and glamorous fun. She is survived by her daughters Felicia W. Rogan of Charlottesville, VA and Jill W. Cartter of Beverly Hills, CA. She was also the beloved friend and quintessential aunt of Bobbie Adler Katzander of New York City. No services are to be held. In keeping with her great sense of charitable responsibility donations can be made to the Cancer Center of Santa Barbara.
