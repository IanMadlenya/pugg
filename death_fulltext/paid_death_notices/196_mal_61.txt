The Yeshiva University family expresses deep sorrow upon the passing of the beloved husband of Marokh, father of Tanaz, and brother of Dr. Massoud Jack (and May) Eshaghian, Dr. Joseph (and Dr. Faye) Eshaghian, Helen (and Mehdi) Iloulian, and David (and Simone) Eshaghian, dedicated member of the University's Board of Trustees and the Board of Directors of Yeshiva College, and founding chairman of the University's Sephardic Council of Overseers. In the tradition of his late father, YU Benefactor Ebrahim, who established the Ebrahim Ben Davood Eliahu Eshaghian Transgenic Facility for Biomedical Research at our Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and with his siblings, he was a devoted supporter of Jewish education and scholarships for Sephardic students at the University and was widely respected in the community at large. Our heartfelt condolences to the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University Ronald P.
