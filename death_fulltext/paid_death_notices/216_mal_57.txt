        McCARTY--Dr. Maclyn. The New York Academy of Medicine records with profound sorrow the death of Dr. Maclyn McCarty, who was elected to Fellowship in 1948. In his career he exemplified the ideal expression of the physician - scientist, contributing importantly to work in the laboratory of Dr. O.T. Avery at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research that resulted in the characterization of DNA as the genetic substance, and later emerging as a leader in the characterization of the streptococcal cell wall, work leading to understanding of the pathogenesis of rheumatic fever. Educated in medicine and in pediatrics at Johns Hopkins, he spent the remainder of his life at the Rockefeller Institute, later the Rockefeller University, serving as Physician-in-Chief to the hospital of the Rockefeller Institute and as vice president of the University. He honored numbers of institutions and societies with his membership, including the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was the recipient of numerous awards, and was honored twice by the Academy of Medicine, receiving the Academy Medal for scientific accomplishment, presented in 1979, and its John Stearns Award for lifetime achievement in medicine, presented in 1993. The Academy of Medicine, biomedical science, and humanity generally are the richer for his life. Jack D. Barchas, M.D. Chairman, Board of Trustees Jeremiah A. Barondess, M.D., President
