        RINGWOOD-James J. The Board of Directors and Staff of Lighthouse International extend their condolences to his wife, Maureen, and the family, friends and colleagues of James J. Ringwood on his passing. We are profoundly indebted to Jim for his long time leadership role with the Vision Fund of American, a group of professionals in the media industry; Jim served as President of the group in 1997 and 1998. The Vision Fund's fund-raising activities through the years generated millions of dollars for the work of the Lighthouse, helping people everywhere overcome vision impairment. In his own commitment to this cause, Jim's humor, and positive, can-do spirit was always valued by us, and now cherished. William B. Follett, Chairman of the Board Barbara Silverstone, DSW, President & CEO Lighthouse International
