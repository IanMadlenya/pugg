        $(6$)SACKS--Dr. Leonard Sanford, on July 2, 2006, in Beverly Hills, CA. Father, friend, and mentor, he made everyone feel important. Born July 8, 1925, to Lillian and Harry Sacks, in Newark, NJ, Leonard devoted his life to uplifting humankind. As a clinical psychologist in private practice for more than fifty years, he was a trusted counselor and confidante; as a professor at Seton Hall University, and The City University of New York, he developed pioneering programs for children with special needs. Leonard was the consumate New Yorker. He lived in The Apthorp on Manhattan's Upper West Side with the late Shirley Kamell Sacks, his wife and best friend of 43 years; in her honor Leonard endowed academic and music scholarships at Teachers College and Barnard College. With values rooted in faith and fellowship, Leonard and Shirley travelled the world together. And they cherished their three children: Leo, a record producer, lyricist and journalist; Joanne, an educational psychologist; and David, a television writer and producer. Leonard leaves a brother, Myron, and a sister, Betty; a son-in-law, David Salomon; two daughters-in-law, Judy Sacks, and Bo Corre; and eight beloved grandchildren. Summing up his life's philosophy, he said, simply: ''I tried to be mensh.'' Funeral services will be held at 10 A.M. today at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th St. Burial will follow at Sharon Gardens in Valhalla, NY. A memorial service is planned.
