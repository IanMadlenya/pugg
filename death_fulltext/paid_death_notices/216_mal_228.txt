        KARBANK -- Barney. We mourn the death of Barney Karbank, a leading business and philanthropic figure in Kansas City and father of Neil Karbank, Chair of the HIA Board of Directors. Real estate developer and generous supporter of social and religious causes, he took loving pride, so richly deserved, in his family. We extend our deepest sympathies to them.
