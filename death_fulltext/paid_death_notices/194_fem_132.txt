        RATTNER-Ruth J. (Bunny ). Left this world on March 18, 2003. Her immediate family, husband Milton, daughters, Bambi & Dawn, granddaughter Mackenzie, sister Dorothy Love & brother-in-law Barry Love. After graduating from Penn State, she went on to teach at both the high school and college levels. From there she dedicated herself to her husband and children yet still found time to volunteer as Director of Outreach for the Bronx Zoo and running The Skating Club of New York's Junior Club. After graduating from the French Culinary Institute, she joined the team at Hansel 'n Gretel as an Executive Vice President. Eventually, led by a dog, she found a farm, raised sheep and chickens and still found time to volunteer on the boards of both Chesterwood Museum and Shaker Hancock Village. Guts and zest for life enabled her to be with us for extra borrowed time. Thank you Bunny for enriching our visions. We love you. Service Thursday 2 PM at ''The Riverside'', 76th Street & Amsterdam Avenue. In lieu of flowers contributions may be made to Beth Israel Cancer Center - Development Dept. First Avenue at 16th Street, NYC 10003.
