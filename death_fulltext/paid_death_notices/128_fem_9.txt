        MILLER-Libby Shana. On August 29, after receiving bad news about cancer spread this brave and noble woman who put up an extraordinary fight, finally decided she had had enough of ''unfair'' pain & suffering. Formerly of Manhattan, she had moved with her husband of 37 years, Alan, to San Francisco to ''make a new life.'' This did not happen! Loving mother of Elisa & Jennifer, and son-in-law Greg, daughter of Mabel, sister of Manny, she was an inspiration to all, an ardent defender of her family and a rock of support even in her terrible illness. Throughout her life, she had been a gentle but firm teacher, a mentor, a role model for an extraordinary number of young women and evoked tremendous loyalty from all who came in contact with her. She will be missed terribly. Services Tuesday September 2, 10AM at Plaza Memorial, 91 Street and Amsterdam Ave 212-769-4400.
