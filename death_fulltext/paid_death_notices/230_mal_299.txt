        GARIL--Michael J. Passed away on March 23 at the age of 39. For more than 31 of those years, Michael courageously--and without ever losing his sense of humor-faced many obstacles that would have easily beaten down a lesser person, and he overcame each and every one of them. He was dedicated to his family, his friends, his Dallas Cowboys and the fight against leukemia. To aid him in that fight, contributions in his memory can be made to the Michael Garil Fund for Leukemia Research, c/o Dr. Stephen Sallan at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 44 Binney St, Boston MA 02115. Michael is survived by his parents, Ethel and Bernie, and by the spirit of his sister Stacey who passed away earlier. Funeral services will be held Sunday, March 26, at 11:45AM at the Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76 Street, New York, NY.
