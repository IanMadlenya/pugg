        LYON-Daniel. The officers, staff and leadership of the Jewish Labor Committee note with deep sadness the death of Daniel Lyon, father of our Executive Director, Avram Lyon. A loving father and grandfather, devoted husband to his wife, Tessie, who passed away two years ago. He will be deeply missed by all who knew and loved him. We extend heartfelt condolences to Avram, his sister Barbara Redmond, and the entire family. May his memory be a blessing. Morton Bahr, President Jewish Labor Committee
