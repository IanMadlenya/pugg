        MARCUS-Jay M. The Marcus family mourns the loss of their devoted husband, father, brother, uncle and mentor, Jay Mordechai Marcus. Son of Solomon & Bessie Marcus, his immutable drive taught and inspired, opening our horizons to culture through his descriptions of books, food, love of arts, Judaism and hard work. He was an honorable man who was respected and admired by many and leaves behind a void that will never be filled. He will be sorely missed by his loving wife of 36 years, Sylvia, five children: Lisa, David, Robert, Jonathan, Sabrina; four grandchildren: Jarred, Kendall, Justin, Elana, brothers and sisters, Morris, Reuben, Lillian and Charlotte. Services on Sunday, January 10, 11:15am at ''Gutterman's Inc.'', 175 Long Beach Road, Rockville Centre, Long Island.
