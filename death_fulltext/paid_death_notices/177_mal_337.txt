        MINTZ-Francis, Esq. The Joint Retirement Board for Conservative Judaism deeply mourns the passing of ''Fritz'' Mintz -a devoted Trustee who worked tirelessly for the benefit of our members and for all of Conservative Judaism, to which he referred as his ''beloved second family of the past forty years.'' He was an esteemed attorney whose wise counsel, refreshing sense of humor and bright disposition will be sorely missed. May his family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Alan M. Edelstein, CPA, JD, Chairman of the Board Nina Rone, CPA, Chief Operating Officer
