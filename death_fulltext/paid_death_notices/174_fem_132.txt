        GROHS-Belle. 89, of NYC, died July 14, 2001. Beloved wife of the late Arnold Grohs, devoted sister of the late Gertrude Busch and Lillian Blum, cherished aunt of Elizabeth Busch-Le Ne, Margaret Busch and Charles Busch and loving great-aunt of James Stull. A woman of great spirit, born in Cincinatti, OH, in 1911, she was a veteran of WWII and Korea. She was for many years dietitian and head of Home Economics for both Childrens Center and Jennings Hall for Boys. Her commitment to public service and volunteer work through her support of Roosevelt Hospital, and particularly their AIDS ward, made her a true role model for all senior citizens. Services Tuesday, July 17, at 9:30 AM at ''The Riverside,'' 76th St. and Amsterdam Ave., with interment to follow at Ferncliff Cemetery, Hartsdale, NY. In lieu of flowers, donations to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Volunteer Fund, care of Volunteer Department, 1000 10th Ave., NYC 10019 would be appreciated.
