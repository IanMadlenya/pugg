        PERCES-Paul N. On January 10, 2002. The Cystic Fibrosis Association of Greater New York marks with profound sadness the passing of Paul Perces, our beloved friend and esteemed member of the CFA Board of Directors. Paul, together with Marjorie, was a pioneering advocate for cystic fibrosis children & served for better than 35 years in dedicated effort to advance the life horizons for Becky and all cystic fibrosis young. His humanism, dynamic personality and creativity meaningfully furthered the research, care and scholarship programs helping to bring today's CF average age of survival to 31 years. His vision and warmth of caring will be greatly missed. Our love and heartfelt condolences to his wife Marjorie and the family. Phyllis L. Kossoff, Chairman Norton Hight, President
