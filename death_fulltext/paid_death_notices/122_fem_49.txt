        KATZ-Leanne G. The American Civil Liberties Union mourns the passing of Leanne Katz, an indefatigable champion of freedom of expression for all people. Her dynamic leadership of the National Coalition Against Censorship helped, against great odds, to preserve and strengthen First Amendment rights in our country. For this, and her earlier contributions to the ACLU's organizational development, we express our deep appreciation for her many contributions to civil liberties and democratic values. Nadine Strossen, President Ira Glasser, Executive Director American Civil Liberties Union
