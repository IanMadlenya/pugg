        TWINING--Renee Kohn. Died December 26, 2005, 101 years old, in Manhattan. Emigrating from Vienna, Austria with parents and six siblings she entered the swirl of New York in the 1920's. She lived life fully and with grace. Her memory will be cherished by son and daughter-in-law Ralph and Rochelle Field of Westport, CT; grandchild Judith and her husband Jean Polgar of Cambridge, MA; grandchild Jonathan Field of NY; grandchild Kathryn Field of Center Sandwich, NH; and great-grandchildren Caroline, Emma, Aaron and Amelia, as well as devoted nieces and nephews and many dear friends. Long intrigued by style and interior design, she opened her own showroom at 509 Madison Avenue, decorating the Stephen Wise Free Synagogue, NYAC, Republic National Bank, Russian UN Mission, two pavilions at the 1954 World's Fair, Schrafts Restaurants, and numerous homes in New York. She collaborated with the architectural firm of Kahn and Jacobs in the remodeling of Saks Fifth Avenue, and advanced the use of fiberglass in interior design working with Edmund S. Twining of Owens Corning Fiberglass, whom she later married, following the death of Mr. Twining's first wife. She taught us the joys of work, friendship, family and, at the end, the strength to confront fear with laughter.
