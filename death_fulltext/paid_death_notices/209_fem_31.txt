        DICKSTEIN -- Edith. The Board of Directors, management and staff of White Plains Hospital Center mourn with extreme sorrow the passing of our dear friend, Board member and benefactor, Mrs. Edith Dickstein. Edie's, along with her beloved late husband Frank's, participation and contributions to our Hospital spanned more than 30 years and did a great deal to make possible our pre-eminent position as the leading health care provider in Westchester County. Her continuing support and inspirational leadership created the Dickstein Cancer Treatment Center, Westchester's only free-standing cancer treatment facility, which offers compassionate stateof-the-art cancer care. Edie's devotion to the Hospital was extraordinary. She was a respected philanthropist who was deeply committed to improving the quality of life for families and children. Her endearing nature and vivacious spirit will be missed by all of us. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to her children: Dennis and Nancy Gilbert, Pam and Jeffrey Gittleman, and Laurie and Barry Siegel and their children and grandchildren. Robert Feder, Chairman of the Board of Directors Jon B. Schandler, President and CEO
