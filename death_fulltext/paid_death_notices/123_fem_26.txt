        LAVINE-Abigail. The New-York Historical Society extends its heartfelt sympathies to the family of Abigail Lavine. Abbey was respected for her excellent help as a reference assistant and loved for her quick wit and free-spirited nature, not to mention her wonderful fashion sense. We miss her. Betsy Gotbaum, Exec.
