        SOLOMON-Joan. The Board of Directors of the Tranquillity Alumni acknowledges with deepest sorrow the passing of our beloved friend and fellow Tranquillity-ite, Joan Solomon. ''Joanie'' was a hard working Board member and lifelong supporter of Camp Tranquillity. Together with her husband Joe, she worked tirelessly to the benefit of the Camp and its Campers. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to her husband, Joe; children, Barbara and Nolan, Susan and Lenny; precious grandchildren, David and Alyssa; and devoted sister, Irene. Joanie's infectious smile, hearty laugh and warmth will be forever in our memories. Tranquillity Alumni, Inc.
