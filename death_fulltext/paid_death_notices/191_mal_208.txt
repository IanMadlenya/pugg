        KLEIN-Regina. The officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Regina Klein, beloved mother of George Klein, a dedicated supporter of UJA-Federation who has expressed his love of the Jewish community through exceptional leadership and philanthropy. George has been especially helpful in establishing strong partnerships between UJAFederation, its agencies and the local, state, and federal governments. We extend our deepest sympathies to George, his wife Adele, and to Regina's entire family. Larry Zicklin, President Morris W. Offit, Chair of the Board John S. Ruskay, Exec. V.P. & C.E.O.
