        TIGER-Edith. The Center for Constitutional Rights mourns the passing of our beloved Board member, Edith Tiger. Edith was a tireless fighter for justice who figured in many of the most important political battles of the past 60 years. Edith was one of the founders of The National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee, organized to defend against proscecution based on political beliefs. She served as its Director for over 30 years, the first woman in the United States to lead a prominent civil rights organization. Edith's indomitable spirit and devotion to the Constitution will be a source of inspiration to all of us. Our heartfelt condolences to her daughter Martha Potter, son-in-law Mark Potter, grandchildren Jesse Stewart, Judson and Nathan Potter, and her great-grandchildren, Harrison, Gideon, and Ezra Potter. For memorial information call CCR, 212-614-6464 ext 400.

        TIGER-Edith. First woman to head a national civil liberties organization, the National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee. Edith (and Michael Krinsky) uncovered proof of extensive FBI COINTELPRO wiretaps and ''black bag jobs'' against the Guild. Her faith in the Constitution is more timely than ever.
