        HERMAN-Alpert, M.D. The Association of the Attending Staff of The Mount Sinai Hospital mourns the passing of our beloved colleague and dedicated member of the Department of Psychiatry for over 50 years. Dr. Alpert was a founding member of the Division of Group Psychotherapy and had a distinguished career in the army as a psychiatrist in World War II. He continued to play a major role in the area of Group Therapy and was also actively involved in teaching residents and students at Mount Sinai. He will best be remembered for his thoughtfulness, sense of humor and great spirit. We extend our sincere condolences to his entire family.
