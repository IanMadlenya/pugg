        BECKER-Leonard. The Board of Directors and staff of the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service mourn the loss of former Assistant to the Executive Director, Leonard Becker, age 78, who died on July 7, 2001, at Huntington Hospital following a brief illness. A native of Chicago and a veteran and recipient of the Bronze Star for his service in World War II, Mr. Becker graduated from the University of Chicago in 1949 and went on to study for several years at the Sorbonne in Paris. In 1965 he joined the Brooklyn Bureau as Director of Information and was later promoted to Assistant to the Executive Director. He continued to be actively involved until his death, providing valuable contributions to the Bureau and to the children, families and disabled men and women helped by the agency. We send our deepest condolences to his wife Joan (Holliday) Becker and their family. In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to the St. Paul's Lutheran School Scholarship Fund, 106 Vernon Valley Road, East Northport, NY 11731.
