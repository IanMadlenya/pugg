        SIEGEL--Abe. 83 years old, while vacationing in New Mexico. Abe would say, ''not to worry,'' and that it had been a great run. He did indeed have a long and rich life. Husband, father, grandfather and uncle, he adored his family. Abe also loved the practice of law and worked as an attorney to the very end at the law firm he founded, Siegel Chalif and Winn, P.C. He loved nature, ideas and new experiences. He leaves behind his wife Ruth, his two children, Jonathan Siegel (Susan Rose) and Karen Engel (Jonathan Engel), four grandchildren, Emily, Katy, Brian and William, his niece and nephew Suzanne and Ken Gruber, and sister Sylvia Strauss. His hope and optimism were contagious and touched many lives. He was a wonderful friend. He will be missed profoundly. Funeral services, today, Riverside Chapel in Great Neck; please call for time, 516-487-8600.
