        PACHETTI-Renato. It is with great sadness that RAI Radiotelevisione Italiana, Italy's public broadcasting system, acknowledges the loss of one of its most dedicated and beloved colleagues. For over 30 years, Renato Pachetti served RAI with the highest level of professionalism and enthusiasm whose legacy is RAI Corporation, the New York subsidiary of the Italian company. In addition to his career at RAI, starting as its United Nations correspondent rising to Chairman of RAI Corp., Mr. Pachetti also served as Chairman of the Foreign Press Association of the United States, Chairman of the International Council of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences and President of the Italian business association Gruppo Esponenti Italiani. He also served as the President of ''LaScuola d'Italia'' Guglielmo Marconi in New York City. He will be deeply missed by everyone in the RAI family as well as by all who knew him in the broadcast and journalism communities. We extend our most heartfelt sympathies to his wife Diane and his sons Alex, Nick, Edward and their families.
