        ROSENTHAL--Hinda The Richard and Hinda Rosenthal Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons notes with deep sorrow and heavy hearts the passing of our beloved founder, friend and long-time supporter, Hinda Gould Rosenthal. She was a pioneer, progressive and courageous; and with her late husband Richard, blazed a trail by initiating a broadbased alternative medicine program at an academic medical center when no other existed, leading the way for others later to follow. She will be remembered for her indomitable spirit, visionary leadership, integrity, passion and incredible zest for life. She embodied all that is best in the human spirit and heart, and was one-of-a-kind. Her generosity, personal interest and dedication over the past 13 years has been an inspiration to us all. We will deeply miss her wisdom, creativity, warmth and friendship and are so grateful for the chance to have been a part of her life. We extend our sincere condolences to her beloved husband Bernie, to Rick, Jamie and all of the Rosenthal and Rosenberg families. With great admiration, respect and love. Fredi Kronenberg, Director
