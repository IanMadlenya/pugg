        TOBIN-James. The board, administration, scholars and staff of The Levy Economics Institute of Bard College mourn the passing of a dear friend and colleague, James Tobin, who shared with us his brilliant counsel and enduring wisdom as a member of our board of advisors. His generous intellectual contribution to the Levy Institute, particularly during its formative years, will long be remembered and cherished. James Tobin was an economist of rare stature whose contributions to the discipline brought it closer to the real world. He will be sorely missed. We extend our deepest condolences to his family. Leon Botstein, President, Bard College Dimitri B. Papadimitriou, President, The Levy Economics Institute
