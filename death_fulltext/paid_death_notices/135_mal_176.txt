        RATNER-Frank, M.D. The members of the Medical Society of the County of Queens express their profound sadness on the loss of their beloved colleague and friend, Frank Ratner, M.D. A distinguished and dedicated physician, Dr. Ratner proved to be a steadfast leader as he served the society as past-president, secretary and chairman of the Board of Censors. He will be sorely missed. Our deepest sympathies to his wife Helen, his children Dr. Lee Ratner, Beth Lyons, Dr. Jill Ratner Rosenberg, his nine grandchildren and his sister, Dr. Hilda Ratner.
