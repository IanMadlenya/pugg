        FARBER-Sylvia Gold. Her family notes with deep sadness the passing, after a brief illness, of the dearly beloved wife of the late Milton H. Farber, former President of South West Farber Inc. (Farberware). Loving mother of Marilyn Farber Jacobs and Alan S. Farber and adored grandmother of Stanley G. (and Janice) Jacobs, Jr. and Scott A., Tami L. and Michael J. Farber, cherished sister of Abe (and Honey) Gold, mother-in-law of Karen Farber, treasured stepmother to Margaret Jacobs Haviland, Susan Jacobs Corria and Lisabeth Jacobs, a dear and loving friend to many. A consummate scholar who continuously attended college courses, even in her later years, and received the respect of her peers at Palm Beach Community College. She was also known for her creativity in the arts. To every endeavor, she brought energy, enthusiasm, intuition, a keen wit, a striving for perfection and strong committment. A longtime member of ORT. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that contributions be made to ORT or to The Children's Service League (of Westchester County, NY) of which she was a member. Courageous and proud to the end, she will be sorely missed by all of us. Funeral services will be held at Riverside Memorial Chapels, 180 West 76th St., NYC at 10:00 AM, on July 2nd. Shiva will be held from 1:30PM6:30PM at The Princeton Club (15 West 43rd Street, New York).
        FARBER-Sylvia. Dear Sylvia, I shall miss you and all the good times we had together. I close with deep sorrow. Mussie Gellis.
        FARBER-Sylvia. My younger sister, who I loved dearly will be missed forever. Rest in peace. Abe Gold
