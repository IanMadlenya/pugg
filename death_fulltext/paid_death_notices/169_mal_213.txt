        HIRTENSTEIN-Daniel. Daniel, a man for all seasons, a man for all reasons, a many you could talk to, a man you could learn from, a man of charity and kindness, a man of love and laughter. His warmth, wisdom, compassion, unbelievable perseverance against all odds and his great, big smile will forever be felt in our hearts. Dan was not only a good friend, but a great listener and advisor. Our thoughts and prayers are with Audrey, Tracy, Andrew and their families. Dan, rest well as you are forever in our hearts. Robin and Jeff Michaels
