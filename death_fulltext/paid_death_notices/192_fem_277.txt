        SCHMETTERER - Rosalie, 87, died peacefully in her sleep at her home, Plantation Village, in Wilmington, NC. Born Rosalia Fernandez in Westfield, MA, she and her husband Robert (deceased 1980) lived most of their lives in Hillsdale, NJ. A remarkable woman, who spent her life giving to others, Rosalie was a great inspiration to all who knew her. There was always an honest word and an answer to every question. She was an insatiable reader, conversationalist, lover of music, animals, scrabble and most of all, her family and friends. She led an extremely full life and left us with so many wonderful memories that the thoughts of her will always be with a smile, and even sometimes with a giggle. She was our hero and will be sorely missed by all. A memorial service will be held in NJ. She is honored by her two sons and their wives, Bob and Stacy of NYC, Richard and Donna of Wilmington, NC, and her three grandchildren and their partners, Adam and Erika of Stockholm, Sweden, Tyler and Sharon of NYC, and Tracy and Michael of Los Angeles, CA. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Ocean Reef Cat Rescue (ORCAT), 24 Dockside Lane, #
