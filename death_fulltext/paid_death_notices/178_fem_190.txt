        KONECKY-Lewis. The National Jewish Outreach Program (NJOP) mourns the passing of Lewis Konecky, devoted husband of Cyrena, and beloved father of Dr. Priscilla (Dr. Marc Tepper), Dr. Elizabeth (Yaakov Kronfeld), and Dr. Margaret (Dr. Larry Osher). Elizabeth, a valued member of NJOP's Board of Directors, and her husband Yaakov, and the entire Konecky family, have played a crucial role in NJOP's effort to assure a bright Jewish future for American Jewry. Yehi Zichro Baruch. Rabbi Ephraim Z. Buchwald, Dir.
