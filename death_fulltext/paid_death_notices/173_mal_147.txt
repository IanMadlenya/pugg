        SHALOM-Joseph. The Management and Employees of I. Shalom & Company, Inc., and Jordan Accessories mourn the passing of our President and mentor, Joseph Shalom, whose fairness and generosity touched all who were in contact with him. To Joseph, personal relationships and compassion superseeded economic and business expediency. He was a warm and generous friend, and our Company and industry will long remember his enduring virtues.
