        ULNICK--Fanny. Wife of the late Martin, beloved sister of the late Leah Pliskin and the late Artie Gertner, died on Tuesday, January 13, after a brief illness. Our beloved aunt Fanny was a unique and remarkable person who endured painful losses in her lifetime but never lost her love of life. She had the gift of gab and a smile which could light up a room. She loved to laugh and have fun. Aunt Fanny was a nurse by profession and disposition. If the profession hadn't existed it would have had to have been invented for her. Survived by her loving sister-in-law Arlene Gertner, nieces and nephews Deborah and Robert Berkal, Roger and Fran Pliskin, Irwin and Ellen Pliskin, Charles Gertner, Suzanne and Terry Timar, Roxanne and Ira Lewis; lovingly remembered by grandnieces and nephews Robert Greenhaus, William Greenhaus and Randy Brett, Marcy Kravet, Lisa and Ben DiDonato, Randi and Steven Wilkins, Brent and Shannon Pliskin, Michael and Rhonda Pliskin, Alexander and Greta Pliskin. Also mourned by great-grandnieces and nephews Adam and Leah Greenhaus, Daniel and Shayna Kravet, Jennifer, Dana, and Melissa DiDonato, Iyla, Marli and Matthew Wilkins, Lyndsey, Ryan and Reid Pliskin, Dylan and Devon Pliskin, Jennifer and Michael Mastick, Kate and Debra Lewis, Brandon and Ashley Timar. Aunt Fanny, you were one of a kind. You have touched our lives in a meaningful way. You are loved by all. Our ''Queen of the Nile,'' will never be forgotten.
