Ageless-dearly beloved soul mate of Ann Andersen-Birnberg, father to Jeffrey, Vicki, Jill and Jackie; grandfather to Spencer, Erika, Samantha, Michael, Ashley and Jonathan; great-grandfather to Julian and Jonah departed this life on December 30, 2000 after a three month illness with cancer. Monte was a graduate of New York University who served in the Marine Corp in WW II making the landing in Okinawa to retire as a full Major. In 1961 he founded Great Atlantic Insurance Co acting as both CEO and President. He ran four major companies for Frank B. Hall. Monte who traveled extensively around the world in his business was also well respected by Lloyd's Syndicate in London. While one of the most prestigious figures in the insurance industry Monte found time to lecture on insurance at Princeton University as well as being an adjunct professor at The College of Insurance in New York City. When he and his wife Ann moved to Miami Monte was still involved in the insurance field and at the time of his passing was President of the United States Underwriters in Bay Harbor. Monte was a true Renaissance man who wrote inspired children's stories and was in the process of writing an as yet unfinished novel at the time of his death to be completed by his adored wife Ann. There will be a memorial service in New York City to be announced at a later date. If you wish to offer a donation Monte's expressed wish was that you give to his beloved Florida Philharmonic Orchestra to be sent to the attention of: Mrs. Ann Andersen-Birnberg (The Florida Phiharmonic Orchestra) 12000 North Bayshore Drive #
