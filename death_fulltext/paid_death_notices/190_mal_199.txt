        FALCON - Sanders. We mourn the loss of Sanders Falcon, devoted and dedicated son, father, brother and husband. Sandy passed away on November 10, 2002 in Boynton Beach, FL. He was 67 years young. Sandy is survived by his wife Debra; his mother Ann (Anky); his sister Carol and his children Jeff, Robyn and Evan. He took into his heart the loves of his children Jazz Nalbant and Benjamin Leidner. Death can never overcome the warmth and light his life has brought to those who loved him. Rest now Sandy, you live forever in our hearts.
