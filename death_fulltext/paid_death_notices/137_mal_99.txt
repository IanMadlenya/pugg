        LEVENSON-Emanuel. Today we mark the passing of a great musician, teacher and friend, Emanuel Levenson. What he gave to us could not have been bought for all the money in the world. He steadfastly served beauty and truth. He was a bright and brilliant link in a chain of illuminated souls working together for the upliftment of humanity. He achieved neither fame nor fortune in this world; he lived ethically and without compromise. The legacy of his teaching is a pure and living thing, excellent and perfect in its way.
