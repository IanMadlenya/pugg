        NEIBACHER--Susan L. The Board of Directors and staff of Care for the Homeless note with great sadness the death of our founding Executive Director on November 5, 2004 and express our condolences to her mother Laura, her brother the Reverend Albert L. Neibacher Jr. and his family, and to her community at Saint Peter's Lutheran Church at Citicorp Center. A native New Yorker and 1969 graduate of Columbia University School of Social Work, Ms. Neibacher dedicated her professional career of more than 30 years to poor and homeless people. She was a consummate social worker who taught at several social work schools in New York City and was active on the Board of the National Health Care for the Homeless Council, the New York City Council Legislative Advisory Commission on the Homeless, and several other boards and coalitions. All who had the priviledge of knowing her well will miss her for her wise counsel and warm friendship. In recognition of her many contributions to New York's homeless people and of Susan's persistant leadership in developing a new women's shelter and drop-in center, the Board wishes to announce its intention of naming this facility on Jerome Avenue in the Bronx in her honor. A Mass of the Resurrection and Committal Service will take place at Saint Peter's Lutheran Church, 619 Lexington Avenue (enter 54th Street) on Thursday, November 18, 2004 at 7:00PM. At Susan's express request, in lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Saint Peter's Church or to Care for the Homeless (Susan L. Neibacher Fund). Kent D. Wakeford, President G. Robert Watts, Acting Executive Director Care for the Homeless
