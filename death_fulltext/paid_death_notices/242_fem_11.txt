        DANTUONO--Louise M., M.D. The Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the NYU School of Medicine and The Bellevue Obstetrical and Gynecological Society mourn the death of Louise M. Dantuono, M.D. She became the first female resident of the department in 1943 and the first female faculty member in 1946. She was a founding member and past president of The Bellevue Obstetrical and Gynecological Society. A compassionate and caring physician who afforded her patients and the department the same skill and compassion she did the Society. We express our condolences to her family. John P. Curtin, M.D., Chair, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Livia S. Wan, M.D., President, The Bellevue Obstetrical and Gynecological Society
