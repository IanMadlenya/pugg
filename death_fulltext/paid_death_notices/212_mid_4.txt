        KOPLEWICZ -- Roma. The board and faculty of the NYU Child Study Center mourn the loss of Roma Koplewicz, devoted wife, partner and friend of Joseph (Joe) Koplewicz, beloved mother of Edith, Linda and Harold S. Koplewicz, Director, loving grandmother to Joshua, Adam, Sam and Alex. After surviving the Holocaust, Roma enjoyed a long and joyous marriage to Joe and together they created a family that she cared for dearly. Roma was passionate about her work as a social worker and was a loving and steadfast friend to many. Our thoughts and prayers are with Dr. Koplewicz and his family.
