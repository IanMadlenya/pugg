        SHULSKY-Rubin. The Mirrer Yeshiva mourns the grievous loss of our esteemed Chairman of the Board Emeritus, Mr. Rubin Shulsky. He was a man of great foresight, strength, generosity and caring whose love for his family and the Jewish people were equaled only by his vision for the future. Mr. Shulsky was indeed a rare individual whose integrity, honesty and ''menschlichkeit'' inspired all those who had the good fortune of dealing with him. The tremendous growth that the Yeshiva has enjoyed is built upon the foundation that the Shulsky family has established for eternity. In fact, the educational wing in our building which bears his name continues to inspire all those who study and pray there. We wish to extend to Rena Shulsky our heartfelt prayers and profound sympathy. It is our fervent wish that you find comfort in your father's kind and noble deeds and that his shining example continues to guide us all. Mirrer Yeshiva Central Institute
