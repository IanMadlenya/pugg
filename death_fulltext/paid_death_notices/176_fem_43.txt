        VOROBIOV-Masha. Of Manhattan, died peacefully at age 67 on September 1 at the home of friends in Plattsburgh, NY. Masha taught Russian language and literature at Vassar College (1977-2000). She provided translation and other invaluable assistance to many Russian emigres, including the poet Joseph Brodsky and the theologian Georges Florovsky. Masha's passing will be mourned by her cousin Longinas Krechinas, her colleagues, her students, and her many friends whose lives were enriched by her gentle-but-firm character, intelligence, sympathetic understanding and generosity of spirit. Contributions in her memory may be sent to the Hospice of the North Country, Plattsburgh, NY.
