        MALNICK--David. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) mourn the loss of David Malnick of San Jose, CA. An enthusiastic supporter of the Technion, Mr. Malnick was Silicon Valley Chapter co-president and former vice president of the North Pacific Region. A successful trial attorney who was introduced to the Technion in the early 1980s, Mr. Malnick and his loving wife Carol hosted many Technion students who worked as summer interns at Silicon Valley companies. He contributed to many Technion projects and participated in several ATS missions to Israel and the Technion. Mr. Malnick's actions reflected his firm belief that support for the Technion is synonymous with support of Israel. To his wife Carol and daughter Meredith, we extend our deepest sympathies.
