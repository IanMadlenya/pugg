        MELTZER-Marjorie. The entire Beth Israel Medical Center family joins with the leadership of its parent company Continuum Health Partners, Inc. and with the physicians and staff of the Nathaniel Meltzer MD Division of Chemical Dependency in acknowledging with sadness the passing of a true friend of our institution Marjorie Melzter. Ms. Meltzer's extraordinary support of chemical dependency services, was recognized with the naming of the division in honor of her beloved late husband who served its patients with great distinction for over 16 years. In addition, Ms. Meltzer exemplified philanthropic leadership through generous contributions to cardiac research and other patient care services. She will be greatly missed by all whose lives were touched by her personal warmth and commitment to help those less fortunate. To her family and all who loved her, we extend our heartfelt condolences. Morton P. Hyman, Chairman Boards of Trustees, Continuum and BIMC Robert G. Newman, MD, President and CEO Continuum Matthew E. Fink, MD, President and CEO, BIMC Henry Singman, MD, President Medical Board, BIMC Stanley R. Yankcovitz, MD, Chief Nathaniel Melzter MD Division of Chemical Dependency Steven F.
