        OLINER-Oskar. The Touro College Faculty and Board extends to Mr. Martin Oliner, distinguished member of our Board of Trustees, its deepfelt condolences on the passing of his beloved father, Mr. Oskar Oliner. Mr. Oskar Oliner was an outstanding product of the Polish Jewish community. His life reflected the disaster which befell his family and community. From the ashes of destruction, he rebuilt a distinguished home and family. His only son Martin Oliner is noted for his dedication to continue the legacy of his forbears and to rebuild Jewish life in the United States and Israel.
