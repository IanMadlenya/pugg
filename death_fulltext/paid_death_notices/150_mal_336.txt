        MOORE-Robert H. (Skipp). Age 63. Passed away July 18, 1999. National Black Theatre's staff and friends mourn his untimely death. We will sorely miss his guiding force as Real Estate Project Director and Consultant for our Harlembased Theatre Arts Complex on 125th Street and Fifth Avenue. His dedication to the success of NBT's Real Estate Project can only be surpassed by his commitment to service and good will. Services will be held Thursday, July 22, 11AM at Hanson Place Methodist Church, 144 Saint Felix Place, Bklyn, N.Y.
