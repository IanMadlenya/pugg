        BARBER--Bernard. 88, on August 20, 2006 in New York City. Married 50 years to his lifelong love, the late Elinor Gellert Barber. Bernard received his undergraduate and doctoral degrees from Harvard University. After serving as a lieutenant for several tours of duty in the Navy, including in the Pacific during WW II, Bernard went on to become a distinguished scholar of sociology, teaching at Barnard College and Columbia University for over 35 years, and writing more than a dozen books and many more articles on various sociological issues, and was a pioneer in the sociology of science and the theory of social structure. Bernard was the recipient of major fellowships and grants including Russell Sage, Ford, Guggenheim and Rockefeller. He served on may boards and panels including the Drug Research Board of the National Academy of Sciences, the Health Advisory Panel, Office of Technology Assessment, US Congress and the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects. Bernard was always interested in the interaction of people, but none more important than his own family. He was the beloved father to Chris Master, Leslie Barnard, Philip Barber and John Barber and father-in-law to George Master, John Barnard, Amy Stursberg and Staci Barber. He will be forever remembered and cherished by them, his ten grandchildren and his many close relatives and friends. A memorial service will be held in September.
