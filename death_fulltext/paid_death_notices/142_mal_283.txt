        TUTTLETON-Prof. James W. The Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science and the Faculty of the English Department of New York University mourn the death of our colleague and friend James W. Tuttleton. As Chairman of our Department and Associate Dean of the Graduate School he strengthened our academic programs. As an essayist on literature and culture and as a scholar of the work of Henry James and the novel of manners, he earned international distinction. His inspired teaching and wit played a unique role in our lives. The James W. Tuttleton Fellowship Fund established in his honor will accept contributions sent to the English Department. A memorial service will be held on Monday, December 7, 1998 from 5 PM to 7 PM in the Greenberg Lounge of the Law School, Vanderbilt Hall, 40 Washington Square South.
