        KATZ-Mo. The DOROT community sadly mourns the passing of Mo Katz. He warmly embraced our mission, guided our vision, and kept us laughing. He was a generous humanitarian, with a twinkle in his eye and an undaunted zest for life. We will always remember him a champion of the elderly and a trailblazer in innovative programming. Our hearts go out to his wife, family, friends, and colleagues at The Fan Fox and Leslie R. Samuels Foundation.
