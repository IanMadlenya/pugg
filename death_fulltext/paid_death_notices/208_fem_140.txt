        LIST--Lois. New School University and Mannes College of Music mourn the passing of Lois List, University Trustee and Mannes Board of Governors member and chair, whose good sense, buoyant optimism, unwavering determination, and love of music literally saved Mannes and championed Mannes's merger with the New School. Her vision of a thriving Mannes within the larger University has been a source of encouragement and inspiration to all who have played a part in the happy fusion of these institutions. We extend our heartfelt condolences to her entire family. Philip Scaturro, Chairman Board of Trustees Bob Kerrey, President New School University John Beerbower, Chairman Mannes Board of Govenors Joel Lester, Dean Mannes College of Music
