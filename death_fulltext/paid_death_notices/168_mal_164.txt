        READ-David H.C. The Trustees of The Living Pulpit, Inc., are saddened by the death of our former Chairman and Editor in Chief, David H.C. Read. We rejoice in his exuberant life and rich legacy of ecumenicism. After his 1989 retirement as Pastor of New York's Madision Ave Presbyterian Church, he devoted much of his time to our quarterly journal, The Living Pulpit, which he had founded in 1991 together with the Rev. Walter J. Burghardt, S.J. and Robert B. Birge. Its purpose is to help Protestant, Catholic and Jewish clergy in their preaching, and also to appeal to thoughtful lay people. David Read was a most remarkable spokesperson for his religious faith and God's love and care for all humanity.
