Pat is survived by Michael Baker, his partner of 26 years; his sister Kathy and her three children, Michael, Rita, and Karin; and many close friends within and beyond Trinity. He will be remembered for his dedication to his teaching, his dedication to his students, his good, caring and insightful work in the classroom, and his keen sense of humor. There will be a celebration of his life at a memorial service to be held at 6:15pm on October 12th at Trinity School.
