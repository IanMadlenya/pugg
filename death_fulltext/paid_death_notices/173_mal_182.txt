        SMITH-Philip. It is with tenderness, affection and great respect that I say goodbye to Philip Smith. He loved his wife Doris, his sons, Jeffrey and Michael and all seven of his grandchildren and his greatgrandchild Sam. Phil Smith was a patriarch, not only for his family but for all who sought his counsel and business acumen. I will miss him. Linnie Smith
