        SIMPSON-William. The Trustees, Women's Board, staff, alumni, and the young members of The Boys' Club of New York express their deepest sympathy to the family of their dear friend. His long association with the Club began in 1940 and he gave generously of his time and ability through all of those years. We will remember him with deep affection.
