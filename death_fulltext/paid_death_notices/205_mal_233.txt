        KELLEN--Stephen M. The Alliance for the Arts mourns the passing of our great friend and benefactor, Stephen M. Kellen. His generosity was equalled by his modesty and by the love he shared with his wife Anna-Maria and his family. He was loyal to what he called his ''two hometowns'', Berlin, where he was born, and New York, which welcomed him and where he prospered. Stephen was a great New Yorker and an elegant, humane citizen of the world. Paul Beirne, Chairman Randall Bourscheidt, Pres. Alliance for the Arts
