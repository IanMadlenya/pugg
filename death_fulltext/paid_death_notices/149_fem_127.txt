        BARTOS-Martha V. The Trustees & staff of the Educational Alliance note with profound sadness the passing of Martha Bartos, our beloved Trustee and friend. Martha joined the Board in 1952 and remained active until her death. She was devoted to and a staunch advocate of the art school, camps, children's programs and our social services. We extend our heartfelt condolences to her daughter Mary, her sons Armand and Michael and their wives, five grandchildren and two great grandchildren.
