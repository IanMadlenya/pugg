        KRAMER-Ruth (nee Eisenberg). 89 years, died on August 24, 2002. Our revered and beloved mother. We will miss her presence but her memory will endure through the love of her children, Kenneth, Joan (Penny) Carpenter, Karen Hein, Jacqueline Kupper. She was loved and respected by her in-law children, Bonny Kramer, Ralph Dell, William Kupper and Peter Foster. Her legacy will be perpetuated by her nine grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. We are comforted by the knowledge that she is with our dad, Dr. Irving Kramer. Services Monday, 12 noon, at ''Riverside-Nassau North Chapels,'' 55 North Station Plaza (opposite LIRR), Great Neck, NY. Contributions may be made to the the Ruth Kramer Memorial Fund, The Living Desert, 47-900 Portola Avenue, Palm Desert, CA 92260.
