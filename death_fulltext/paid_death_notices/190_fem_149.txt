        RADER-Lynn Ossa. Loving and devoted wife and mother died November 18 at age 55. She is survived by her husband Matt, her daughter Amber Sexton and many close friends. She was a gifted and passionate artist and jeweler with a piece in the permanent collection at MOMA. She was a founder of Encounter, Inc., a renowned program for adolescents in trouble. She was active in many social causes even while burdened by Chronic Fatigue Syndrome in her later years. She maintained a spirited and childlike joy for life, and an enduring love for Matt Amber and her friends despite her illness. She will be greatly missed. Lynn's memorial service will be held at the 92nd Street Y on Saturday, Dec. 7, at 2 PM. In lieu of flowers please donate to either God's Love We Deliver, or CFIDS.
