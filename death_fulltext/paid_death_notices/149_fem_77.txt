        BURO-Heather Rose. Bright, sunny, loving and incredibly courageous as she fought her dread disease for two years. She left us on June 10, at age five. To her parents, our niece and nephew, Barbara and Edward Buro, and her grandparents, our sister and brother-in-law, Ruth and Eugene Czeisler, we stand in awe at their extraordinary commitment and tenaciousness in their battle to cure and comfort Heather. We grieve for them and for Heather's sister, Alyssa, her brother, Justin, grandparents, Rose and Patrick Buro, and the entire family. May they take comfort in the memory of this remarkable child. Herbert Rubin, and Justice Rose L. Rubin
