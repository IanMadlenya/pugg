        KEITH-John P. The Directors, Members and Staff of Greater Jamaica Development Corporation mourn with profound sorrow the loss of John P. Keith, retired President of Regional Plan Association. Mr. Keith's strong leadership, integrity and persistent involvement in regional decisions benefitting Jamaica, Queens were fundamental in government and private efforts to create local opportunities and overcome economic distress here. His planning skills, guidance and consensus building determination helped transform this older downtown into a vital center serving community and region. We extend our deep sympathy to his wife, Doris; his son, Alex; his daughter, Janet; and to the entire Keith family. Arthur Benjamin, Jr., Chairman Offices and Executive Committee Vincent M.
