        KINOY-Susan. The Block Island (RI) community of Susan's friends mourns her passing after so many years at her joyous summer home. She takes with her a portion of the beautiful island landscape that is so dear to all of us & to which she contributed so much. She made us see afresh each season the special quality of the sea, the light that graces the cliffs and the beaches that held, for her, a multitude of family and friends. No toddler with her first sandpail was unnoticed by Susan; no longabsent Islander was hailed with more pleasure by anyone more than Susan. For her, the island was yet another site in which she could express her special quality of love for people, for the land on which she picked wild blackberries and for the sun and ocean so nourishing to her soul. Summer will not be the same without Susan, but her warm laughter and dear, loving spirit will echo among the bayberry and the gardens always. Susan's Block Island Friends
