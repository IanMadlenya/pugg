        TROPPER-Yetta. We extend our sincerest condolences to David and Abraham Tropper on the passing of their beloved mother and wife. Throughout her life, Yetta exemplified the values of kindness, modesty and dignity, and was a true ''woman of valor.'' As Founders of the Medical Center, David and his wife, Ina, personify the values of tzedakah and chesed, which they learned from this special woman. May the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Amer. Comm. for Shaare Zedek Jerusalem Med. Ctr. Erica Jesselson, Chair Menno Ratzker, Pres.
