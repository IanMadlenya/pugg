        BIER-Horace. On April 20. The Union for Traditional Judaism and the Institute of Traditional Judaism record with profound sorrow the loss of Horace Bier, the founding president of the UTJ and the first and only chairman of the ITJ. Without Mr. Bier's vision, loyalty and generosity the achievements of these organizations and many others would not have been possible. The entire UTJ and ITJ communities extend deepest sympathies to his wife, Pauline, to his children, Joyce, Bruce, Bryan, and Joseph, to his grandchildren and great-grandchildren. May they be comforted among the mourners for Zion and Jerusalem, and may his memory be a blessing for all who were privileged to know him.
        BIER-Horace. A mighty pillar of the Jewish community has fallen. Passionate in his support of Jewish education as well as to other sacred causes, Horace was to me a dear and precious friend. May his memory be a blessing. Rabbi Benjamin Z. Kreitman
