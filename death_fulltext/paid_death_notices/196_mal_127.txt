        BLACKWELL-James Madison IV. Died May 12 after complications from surgery. A native New Yorker, he was the son of James Madison Blackwell III and Betsy Talbot Blackwell who for 35 years was the Editor-in-Chief of Mademoiselle Magazine. Mr. Blackwell graduated from Harvard in 1952 and then served in the Army during the Korean Conflict. In 1963 he joined the staff of Newsweek Magazine, becoming a Senior Editor in 1972. He remained in that position until 1985, after which he started his own company, Blackwell Consulting. He is survived by his wife Anne Stires Blackwell, three children: Stephen Hardwick Blackwell, Hillary Abrams, and Carolyn Talbot Blackwell, his sister Barbara B. Hird, as well as a grandson, Timothy George Blackwell. He was much loved and will be sorely missed by all of us as well as by all who knew him.
