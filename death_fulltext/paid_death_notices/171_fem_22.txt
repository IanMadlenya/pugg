        SCHAEFER-Helene Hollis. Died on April 2, 2001 at her home. The cause of her death was cancer. Born in the Bronx, New York, 101 years ago, she became a longtime resident of Larchmont after her marriage to F.M.E. Schaefer, former chairman of the Schaefer Brewing Company. The mother of Henry R. Schaefer, Frederica H. Schaefer and Winifred S. Chesley, she was an active volunteer in Bundles for Britain in World War II, and for over 50 years a board member and dominant fundraiser for the Youth Counseling League (now Youth Consultation League) and an active board member of other charitable agencies. Her long-deferred dream to earn a college degree was realized when she, after her husband's death, received a B.A. degree at the College of New Rochelle in 1985, which gave her an honorary degree just before her 100th birthday in 1999. In 1989, she completed a Master of Arts degree from Manhattanville College at age 90. She was a role model in volunteer and academic fields. She had many avocations: an accomplished needlewoman, she was also an expert sailor, as was her husband. Each morning she raised the American flag on her flagpole, a beacon to sailors who would know that they were entering Larchmont harbor. Hundreds of her friends of all ages looked forward to celebrating her birthday on August 17th at her annual parties. She will be missed by all who knew and loved her. She is survived by her three children, 15 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren. A memorial service will be held at St. John's Episcopal Church, Fountain Square, Larchmont, New York at 11:30AM on Thursday, April 5, 2001. Contributions in her name will be gratefully accepted by the College of New Rochelle, Helene H. Schaefer Scholarship for Adult Students, New Rochelle, New York 10805 or the Helene Schaefer Scholarship for Adult Students at Manhattanville College in Purchase, New York 10577, or Jensen Memorial Hospice, Tuckahoe, N.Y.
