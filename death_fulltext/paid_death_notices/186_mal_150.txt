        KAPLAN-Ben. The Officers, Board and staff of the Jewish Association for Services for the Aged note with sadness the passing of Ben Kaplan on June 26, 2002 and record with appreciation his services as Director of Administration from 1968-1989 and Assistant Treasurer from 1989-1990. In his day-to-day relations with Trustees, staff, elderly participants, and government officials, he brought a natural felicity and a warm and gentle manner to his work. His contributions help JASA to develop the largest communitybased social service program for the elderly in the United States. We extend our deepest sympathies to his family and wide circle of friends. Leonard Boxer, President David J. Stern, Executive VP Bernard Warach, Executive VP Emeritus
