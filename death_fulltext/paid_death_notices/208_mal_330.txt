        KIRSCHNER--Philip. On April 29, age 90. We mourn the passing of our father, Philip Kirschner, and celebrate his life and achievements. Dad was President of Motor Parts Industries for 50 years; Cofounder and active member of Temple Isaiah of Great Neck, a founding member of Temple Emanuel, and an active member of REAP. He was immensely kind and generous to his family, community and synagogue. Beloved husband, loving father, grandfather and great-grandfather. Married to his charming wife Leona for 63 blissful years. Survived by his three children, six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. A successful businessman, a scholar, teacher, comedian and all-around great guy. Philip was an inspiration to his family, friends, synagogue and community. We are privileged to have known you and are glad you are together with Mom now. Thank you, Dad, your strength and loving spirit will never be forgotten. In any definition of the words, Philip was truly a great man.
