        ROWER-Howard. Died on November 30 in New York City surrounded by his family. He can be remembered by New Yorkers as the soul behind Club Vinyl. He was early to develop Tribeca from warehouses to what it is today. Howard was the pioneer of organic food distribution. His Infinity Food Co. blazed the trail for wholesome, beneficial foods at a time when to do so was a rebel cause. Howard was a friend of international circus performers and provided aid to those injured in their profession. He traveled with Dr. Patch Adams, clowning in orphanages in Russia, was a member of the Board of Coney Island USA Foundation, and an annual judge of their Mermaid Parade, the Chairman of the Board of the Alexander and Louisa Calder Foundation, on the Board of Threshold Foundation, the Painter Hill Foundation, and a member of the Social Venture Network, but proudest of his membership in the Turtle and Tortoise Society of New York. Howard's connection with Circus Oz (Australia's national circus), lead to his deep devotion to the Aboriginal culture and its art and his formal adoption into a family of Aboriginal people.
