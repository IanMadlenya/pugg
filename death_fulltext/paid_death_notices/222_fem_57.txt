        LISS--Ethel. With profound sadness and love, we mourn the death of Ethel Liss, whose extraordinary caring and thoughtfulness touched the lives of all who had the privilege to know her. Her devotion to her children Mark, Steven, David and Mindy, daughters-in-law Bonnie, Carol and Michelle, and adored grandchildren Aaron, Adam, Emma and Jackson, knew no bounds. Beloved sister and sister-in-law, caring aunt and cousin, and cherished friend, our memories of Ethel will strengthen and inspire us always. Funeral services will be held Monday, July 11 at 1:30 PM, Schwartz Brothers Chapel, 114-03 Queens Boulevard at 76th Road.
