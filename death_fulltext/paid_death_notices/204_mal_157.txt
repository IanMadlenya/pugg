        CHASE--Merrill W. The Rockefeller University Community mourns with deep sadness the loss of our distinguished collegue and beloved friend, Merrill W. Chase. Professor Chase, a valued member of the Rockefeller University research community for 71 years, was a pioneer in the study of cellular immunology and experimental allergy. He uncovered a whole new class of immune responses, which we now call cell-mediated immunity. He will long be remembered as a rigorous experimentalist, as well as for his deep commitment and skill as a teacher. Dr. Chase will be profoundly missed. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his family and collegues. The Merrill W. Chase Historic Scientific Instrument Collection Fund has been established to honor his memory. Those who wish to contribute to this fund may send contributions to The Merrill W. Chase Historic Scientific Instrument Collection Fund, c/o The Rockefeller University, 1230 York Ave, Box 164, New York, NY 10021-6399. Paul Nurse, President Richard B. Fisher, Chairman Board of Trustees David Rockefeller, Honorary Chairman and Life Trustee, Board of Trustees
