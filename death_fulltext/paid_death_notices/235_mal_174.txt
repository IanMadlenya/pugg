        FOGARTY--Jack. It is with great sadness that the alumnae of Camp Jeanne d'Arc acknowledge the loss of our beloved ''Jacques d'Arc.'' With kindness, humor and many talents Jack filled our summers with music and joy for over 40 years. We are thankful for his delightful presence among us and will fondly remember him. We extend our sympathy to his sister, Eileen Litzinger, and his brother, Kevin Fogarty. A memorial mass will be held on Saturday, September 23rd, at St. Jean Baptiste Church, Lexington Avenue and 76th Street, NYC, at 11 AM.
