        LASDON-Mildred. Cornell University mourns the passing of a beloved friend and benefactor. Mrs. Lasdon and her late husband William S. Lasdon, are recognized and remembered for their devoted support of medical research and education at the Cornell University Medical College, where the William and Mildred Lasdon Biomedical Research Center, the Stanley S. Lasdon Teaching Laboratories, and the Nanette Laitman Distinguished Professorship in Public Health are among their many legacies. Mrs. Lasdon's abiding commitment to ease the pain of those touched by illness and disease through the application of medical research and education to patient treatment and care stands as an inspiration to all. We extend our deepest sympathy to Mrs. Lasdon's children, Nanette and Robert, to the entire Lasdon family, and we share their loss. Stephen H. Weiss Chair, Board of Trustees Hunter R. Rawlings III President, Cornell University
