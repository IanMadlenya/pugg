        LEVY-Fannie (nee Kaplan). Died on September 6, 2000, two days short of 106 wonderful years. Her husband, Dr. Herman Levy, predeceased her twenty years ago. She is survived by son Edgar and daughter Francine Kalb, son-inlaw Sandy, grandchildren Gary Kalb and Bonnie, Shoshanna Smith and Robert, great grandchildren Heather and Shannon Kalb, and Justin Smith. We all wish her everlasting peace. She will be sorely missed.
