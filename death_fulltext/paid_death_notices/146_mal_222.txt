        SIMONS-Joe. A valued teacher and a valued friend, Joe's ability to share his knowledge of design was instrumental in the success of the Toy Design Department at FIT. We mourn the loss of an innovative, inventive man of integrity. We have lost a rare and kind person and we will be the poorer for this loss even as we will always be to the richer for having known him. We express our deepest regrets to his family.
