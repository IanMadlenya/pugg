        FEIN-Harry. Thursday, September 17. Beloved husband of the late Lillian. Loving father of Merryl and Alan and their spouses Bernard and Lucy. Adoring grandfather of Dr. Corey Greenwald and wife Dr. Megan Missette and Vicki Greenwald Auerbach and husband Jonathan. Great grandfather to Taran Greenwald. Devoted companion of Esther Altabet and her children and grandchildren. A man of indominable spirit, great humor and intelligence and raconteur par excellence, he devoted himself to his family, his music and the pursuit of knowledge. We miss him already.
