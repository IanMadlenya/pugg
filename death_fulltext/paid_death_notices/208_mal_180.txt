Beloved husband of 50 years of Anne Marie Aberbach, loving father of Belinda Aberbach Stevenson Agar, loving grandfather of Vanessa Stevenson, Elie Stevenson, Max Stevenson, Ezra Stevenson and Chloe Agar, passed away of heart failure in New York City on Monday, May 17, 2004. Julian J. Aberbach was one of the most respected names in American music publishing as well as music publishing around the world. Having emigrated to America from Austria, he served in WWII in the U.S. Army receiving his commission as Second Lieutenant and served as a multilingual liaison with officers of the Free French. He became interested in country music and developed a major music publishing enterprise along with his brother Joachim Jean Aberbach. Major names in Nashville music such as Red Foley, Ernest Tubb, Johnny Cash, Eddie Arnold, Bill Monroe, Left Frizzel and Hank Snow accounted for close to 75% of Hill and Range Songs' country music hits. One of the most significant publishing deals ever made by the Aberbachs was the acquisition of the exclusive publishing rights to the music of Elvis Presley in 1955. By the early 1970's the Aberbach business had become a worldwide music force. Julian Aberbach was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame on June 15, 2000. Julian and Jean Aberbach went on to develop as major figures in the art world as owners of the Aberbach Fine Art Gallery in New York City. He lost his brother in 1992. Additionally, Mr. Aberbach received the Legion of Honor in June 2003 in recognition of his unique contribution to French culture. He was dearly loved and he will be greatly missed.
