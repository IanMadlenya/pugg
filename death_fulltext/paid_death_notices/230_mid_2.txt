        REEVE--Dana. The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis and The Buoniconti Fund deeply mourn the death of our beloved friend Dana Reeve, (wife of the late Christopher Reeve), a great inspiration to all of us in the fight against paralysis. Marc Buoniconti, the International Ambassador of The Miami Project, who himself was paralyzed in a football accident, said recently; ''Every time I saw Dana she was always so full of life, very dynamic and charismatic. Any time she walked into a room it really lit up.'' Last April they lobbied together on Capitol Hill for increased federal funding for spinal cord injury research. Marc added, ''We have a real opportunity to honor both Dana and Christopher by increasing pressure on lawmakers to pass a bill that would significantly increase funding for research. In doing that we can help fulfill the promise Dana made to Chris, which was the same as the one my dad made to me when I was first injured in 1985, to find a cure for paralysis.'' Our love and sympathy goes out to Dana and Christopher's son Will. We know that his parent's legacy will live on in him.
