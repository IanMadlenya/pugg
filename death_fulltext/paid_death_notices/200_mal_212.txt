        MINKIN--David. The Board of Trustees, the Administration, Medical Staff and employees of Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center mourn the loss of David Minkin, our beloved President Emeritus. Founder, builder, benefactor and friend, he was an extraordinary and spirited individual who, for many years, was the patriarch of the Kingsbrook family. During his long life, just shy of 100 years of age, he touched many of us as we hope we touched him. We honor him for his many years of devotion, dedicated service and generous support of the Medical Center and will keep his memory and legacy alive. We extend our sincerest and heartfelt condolences to his family and friends. We shall all miss him. Linda Brady, M.D. President and CEO Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center
