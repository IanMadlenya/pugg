        LASH--Trude. We mourn the loss of our legendary colleague whose lifelong commitment to social justice reflected her close friendship with Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt. Her death truly marks the end of an era but Trude's great work on behalf of children, the homeless, the victims of tyranny and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights will inspire generations to come. Eleanor Roosevelt was a profound influence in her life just as Trude has been for all of us who were privileged by her leadership. The Roosevelt Institute has established the ''Trude Lash Memorial Fund'' to carry forward that legacy. Contributions may be sent to 4079 Albany Post Road, Hyde Park, New York 12538. Trude's family and friends are organizing a memorial service to celebrate her remarkable life on Monday, March 1 at the Cosmopolitan Club, 122 East 66th St at 5PM.
