        PACHNER--Charles. Frenkel & Co., Inc. notes with great sadness the passing of Charles W. Pachner, its former chairman and president. Charles joined Frenkel in 1951 after having practiced law at the firm of Demov and Morris. He pioneered many risk management concepts which are still being used, and was one of the first professionals to attain both the Chartered Property Casualty Underwriter and Chartered Life Underwriter designations. Charles taught an insurance course to all newly appointed insurance commissioners and their deputies through the College of Insurance, where he established an innovative student internship program. Charles retired in 1995 but continued as chairman emeritus at Frenkel through 2004. His high professional standards established the foundation that has carried Frenkel & Co., Inc. to its current growth and success. Frenkel now has offices in New York City with branches in California and New Jersey. We will miss him, and wish to convey our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Janice, and their children. John F. Kelly, Pres. and CEO Robert E. Shunk, Chairman Frenkel & Co., Inc.
