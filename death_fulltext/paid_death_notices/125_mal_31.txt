        ROSSMAN-Isadore, M.D. Montefiore Medical Center notes with profound sorrow the passing of our esteemed colleague and friend, Dr. Isadore Rossman, a respected member of the medical center for half a century. An internationally and nationally recognized clinician and scholar, Dr. Rossman played an instrumental role in developing innovative programs in the fields of social and geriatric medicine. He participated in the establishment, in 1947, of Montefiore's Home Health Agency, the country's first hospitalbased home care agency and, since 1955, served as its medical director. He was president of the American Geriatrics Association, and was author and editor of numerous professional papers, chapters and books. A compassionate and devoted physician and gentleman, he will be missed by his patients, colleagues and all who knew him. Our condolences are extended to his wife, Sylvia; son, Dr. Paul Rossman; grandson, Jonathan, and entire family. Spencer Foreman, M.D., President Jay B. Langner, Chairman Board of Trustees Montefiore Medical Center
