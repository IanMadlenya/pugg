The story of this man's life is what they write books about. He came to America at age 15 speaking only Hungarian. By age 36 he brought his entire family to this country and fulfilled the American dream. He was a co-founder of Dan's Supreme Supermarkets, started in 1948. He worked in his real estate office until he was 105 years old. He was a member of the Unity Club, Town Club and Dellwood Country Club. The Boy Scouts of America honored him with their highest award, the ''Silver Beaver'', for his outstanding fundraising and support. He devoted time to many charities and was an honorary trustee of the East Midwood Jewish Center in Brooklyn. Having lived in three centuries his stories were like traveling through time. When he spoke the whole world listened. He was loved and respected by everyone who knew him. This outstanding, wonderful man will be forever missed and remembered. From all the grandchildren and great grandchildren, ''We love you Popsie.'' ''How much do we love you, we'll tell you no lie, how deep is the ocean, how high is the sky. How many times a day do we think of you, how many roses are sprinkled with dew. How far would we travel to be where you are, how far is the journey from here to a star. And now that we have lost you, how much will we cry. How deep is the ocean, how high is the sky.''
        GROSS-Emerick. ''Popsie'' you were one of a kind! No words could describe your greatness. You will be missed by anyone who was privleged to know you. We love you. Edie and Jeff
