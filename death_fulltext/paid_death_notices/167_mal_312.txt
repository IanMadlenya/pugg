        BLOOD-John Foster. Of Manhattan on December 24, 2000. Citizen of the world, unmatched in his gentility and grace. A dedicated friend, world traveler, strongly committed to reconciliation in Europe, veteran, man of the British rails, selfless in his service to the AUA. Those who knew him will miss his unique love of life. Tony Feldmesser
