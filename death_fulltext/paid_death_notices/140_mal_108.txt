        TAHMOUSH-Albert. The Chairman of the Board, Directors and Employees of Reading Entertainment Inc. express their deepest sorrow over the tragic loss aboard Swissair Flight 111 of our beloved Director and his wife, Albert J. and Odette Tahmoush. Al faithfully served on Reading's Board of Director's since 1981. His insight, wisdom and clarity of thought were always inspirational. He was a consumate gentleman who displayed the utmost integrity and strength of character. His memory will forever be cherished and will continue to set a standard for all of us. We have been blessed to have had such a friend and mentor. We offer the Tahmoush family our most heartfelt sympathy.
