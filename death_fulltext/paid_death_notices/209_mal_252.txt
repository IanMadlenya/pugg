        SEIDMAN--Bert. We sadly mourn the passing of our beloved brother and proudly praise his lifetime of devotion and achievement on behalf of American workers in his various important positions in the national AFL-CIO. Our heartfelt sympathy goes out to his daughters Peggy, Joan and Elizabeth (Betsy), his other loving family members, and his many associates and recipients of the benefits for labor which he helped create. Lloyd and Benedict Seidman
