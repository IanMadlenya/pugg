        MORRIS-Sylvia Kustin. On March 4, 2002. Sylvia departed her devoted husband Norman, to whom she was married for 65 years. She is survived by her loving children, Fredric and Barbara Kuperman, brother Emil, and grandchildren Andrew and Amanda Morris, and Jonathan and Jennifer Kuperman. Language, literature, travel and theater were among Sylvia's joys. Her family remembers her wonderful cooking and tireless caretaking, her sharp mind and sturdy values, her delightful wit. Those close to her feel deeply grateful for her long life.
