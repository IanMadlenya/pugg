        STERN-Marvin, M.D. The faculty, staff and students of NYU School of Medicine express their deep regret and sadness on the death of our friend and colleague, Marvin Stern, M.D. Dr. Stern passed away suddenly on May 13th at NYU Medical Center on his way to see patients. Dr. Stern was an outstanding clinician, gifted teacher, and devoted member of the NYU community. He graduated from NYU School of Medicine in 1939 and began his career here as an Assistant in Psychiatry in 1947. He was appointed Assistant Professor of Psychiatry in 1948 and was appointed Professor of Psychiatry in 1962. In 1979, Dr. Stern was appointed the Menas S. Gregory Professor of Psychiatry. He retired from the faculty in 1995 and was appointed Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry. In recognition of his many years of service to our institution and his patients, the School of Medicine established the Marvin Stern Lecture and the Marvin Stern Professorship. Dr. Stern is survived by his wife, Libby, a graduate of the Bellevue School of Nursing, and their three children, all of whom are graduates of the NYU School of Medicine. Our deepest sympathies go to the entire Stern family. Robert M. Glickman, MD, Dean, NYU School of Medicine Robert Cancro, M.D., Chairman, Dept. of Psychiatry, NYU School of Medicine
