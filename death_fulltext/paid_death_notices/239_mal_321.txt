        OBERWEGER--Gideon S., on December 28. Beloved son of Tania and Oscar, devoted husband and best friend of Claudia, caring father of Alexander and Timothy and their wives, Caroline and Willow, and doting grandfather to Naomi Grace and Charlotte Bailey. He was embraced by a large circle of close friends and relatives. A true American success story, born in Tel Aviv in 1943 and present at the birth of Israel, he immigrated to New York at the age of eight, not understanding a word of English, yet became his high school's valedictorian and graduated from Columbia University. He leaves a legacy of achievement throughout his lifetime in school, business, community and at home. His love of politics, history, sports and his voracious appetite for reading and gaining and sharing knowledge will be missed by all. He traveled the world in search of innovation and creativity to provide for his family. A man of many profound statements, he enjoyed life to the fullest. We are deeply saddened by his loss. Funeral services will take place at Riverside Memorial Chapel on Sunday, December 31 at 11:15 am. In lieu of flowers, contributions in his memory may be made to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society or to Freedom Institute.
