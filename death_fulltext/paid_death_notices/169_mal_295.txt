        SLATER-Joseph Locke, a graduate of Colgate University who returned to his alma mater to head its Department of English and retire from its faculty in 1986 as Edgar W.B. Fairchild Professor of American Literature, died on February 22, in Norwich, New York, of respiratory failure. Professor Slater, a distinguished scholar of the work of Ralph Waldo Emerson and editor of The Correspondence of Emerson and Carlyle (1964), was married for 62 years to Vivien Harvey Slater, pianist-in-residence at Colgate. Class valedictorian in 1937, Prof. Slater received his Ph.D from Columbia University in 1956. From 1944 to 1948, he was a lieutenant in the United States Navy, serving aboard troop transport vessels in the Atlantic and Pacific theaters. Before returning to Colgate, he taught at Lafayette College and at Rutgers University. He wrote extensively for The Saturday Review of Literature, where he served as assistant poetry editor in 1956-57. In addition to publishing in European and American literacy journals, he is best known as editor of the Emerson Carlyle correspondence, and for his general editorship of the Harvard University Press Collected Works of Ralph Waldo Emerson. During his retirement, he devoted himself to indexing his extensive collection of The Masses. Joe is survived, in addition to Mrs. Slater, by his daughter, Lydia Slater, of Hubbardsville, New York, by his son John, of Needham, MA, and two grandchildren, Joseph Kennedy Slater and Thomas Kennedy Slater. A memorial service, to be held on the Colgate campus, is planned for the spring.
