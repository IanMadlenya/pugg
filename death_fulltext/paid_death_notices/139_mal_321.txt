        WILDERS-Rev. Msgr. James G. The Board of Directors, Carmelite Sisters, Staff, Residents, Family circle Members and Volunteers express our deep loss upon the death of Monsignor Wilders, our longtime friend and advisor, on August 25, 1998. As a Member of our Board of Directors he was held in high esteem and was well respected by all who served with him. His Christ-like compassion and understanding as a Chaplain to the Residents of Walsh Home was most inspiring. We shall miss him. Msgr. James J. Murray, President Sr. Sean William, Executive Vice President Board of Directors, Mary Manning Walsh Home
