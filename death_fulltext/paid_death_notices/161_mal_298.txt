        REEMTSMA-Keith, M.D. The Department of Surgery of Columbia University of Physicians & Surgeons and New York-Presbyterian Hospital's Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center are deeeply saddened by the death of our dear friend and colleague, Dr. Keith Reemtsma on June 23, 2000. As Chairman of our Department of Surgery from 1971 to 1994, he served the Medical Center with distinction. He led the way in encouraging the development of centers of excellence in clinical practice and research, fostering interdisciplinary investigation. During his tenure our training program was greatly strengthened and our involvement in new surgical technologies promoted. He was particularly distinguished for his role in the introduction and development and success of organ transplantation at our institution. Always a visionary, he continued to be active in guiding our involvement in transplantation immunology and clinical outcomes research, an area in which he is internationally recognized as a pioneer. His collegiality, his humor, his penchant for innovation and encouragement of young scholars will be sorely missed. We extend our heartfelt condolences to the Reemtsma family.
