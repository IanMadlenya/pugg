        MELTER-Lisa. It is with great sadness and an overwhelming sense of loss that we mourn the untimely passing of our outstanding and much valued Assistant Head Counselor who passed away after a courageous and valiant battle with cancer. A member of the Timber Lake Staff for over six years, her impact on the campers and staff she mentored and guided was profound and permanent. Her kindness, compassion, enduring spirit, and near-permanent smile, even in the face of her most recent and greatest battle, stand out as a testimony to the great person that she was. We extend our sympathies to her beloved husband Ron, adored children, Ross and Adam, her mother Laura Tennenbaum, her sisters, Judy Ratner and Nancy Kahan, and her brother Roy Kapzman. She will always be in our hearts and in all those of the Timber Lake campers and staff that she has touched. Jay and Mindy Jacobs, Directors Timber Lake Camp
