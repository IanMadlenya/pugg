        ABRAM-Morris B. The Trustees and staff of the Lower East Side Tenement Museum extend their deepest sympathies to the family and friends of Morris B. Abram. Father to the Museum's President, Ruth J. Abram, Morris Abram was a great friend to and supporter of the Museum since its inception. A champion of civil and human rights, Mr. Abram served as a role model to many, and he will be long in our memory.
