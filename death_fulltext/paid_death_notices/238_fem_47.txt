        HITE--Patience H. of Princeton, NJ, 83, died at home on Friday, October 27. She was born in San Francisco in 1923, daughter of Ruth Bekins and Herbert Holt. Later, her family moved to Pasadena, CA, where she grew up. She attended Wellesley College and University of California at Berkeley. She worked in New York City and married John B. Hite in Princeton in 1958. Pat was active with PAHR (Princeton Assoc. of Human Rights) in the 1960's, marching for civil rights from Selma to Montgomery, and in Washington, DC. Pat started the Holistic Health Association of the Princeton Area (HHAPA) in 1979, a pioneering organization for information on alternative health care. She was HHAPA's Executive Director until she retired in 1992. Pat suffered a stroke in 1994 that slowed her down in body but not in spirit. She continued to live in her beloved home on Prospect Avenue, with caregivers who worked hard to keep up with her plans and ideas. She was loved by many. Surviving are her two children, Ruth B. Hite of Lawrence, KS and J. Morgan Hite of Smithers, BC; two step-daughters, Aprille Deacon, Derbyshire, England; Virginia G. Hite, Boulder, CO; a sister, Sally Smit; and two grandsons, Galen Hite and William Hite; and many close friends who loved her.
