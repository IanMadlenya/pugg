        STEVENS-Roger L. We mourn with profound sadness the passing of Roger Stevens, a Director of The Metropolitan Opera Association for more than three decades. We recall his visionary leadership and passionate commitment to the arts as the first Chairman of The National Endowment for the Arts and as Chairman of The John F. Kennedy Center for The Performing Arts. A founding member of our Golden Horseshoe Program and a generous participant in our Centennial Endowment Fund, we remember with deep affection his creative participation in Metropolitan Opera activities, especially his encouragement of our Presentations Program, which in cooperation with The Kennedy Center made possible the appearances of the world's greatest performing arts companies at the Metropolian Opera House. We are also grateful for his role in bringing The Metropolitan Opera Company to Kennedy Center as part of our national tour. Roger Stevens has left a unique legacy of public service and philanthropy which will continue to be an inspiring example for generations to come. We extend our condolences to his wife, Christine, and his family. The Metropolitan Opera Asso
