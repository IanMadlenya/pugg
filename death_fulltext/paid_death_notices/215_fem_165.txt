        FRANK--Virginia on December 23, 2004. Her family whom she adored, are profoundly grateful to have shared their lives with a woman of such varied and amazing qualities. Virginia was an explorer, an art collector, an ardent supporter of reform Democratic causes, a doyenne of Brooklyn Jewish Society, a highly competitive fisherwoman, and consummate free spirit who loved life and her grandchildren and great-grandchildren above all. Beloved wife of the late Dr. Lawrence Frank, sister of Ruth Malenka and the late Enoch Stolper, mother of Susan and Steven Bloom and Ivan and Myra Frank, grandmother of Karen and Stephen Gevirtz, Elizabeth and David Bloom, Jason and Daniel Frank, great-grandmother of Naomi Gevirtz.
