        CADMAN--Larry. The One Club mourns the passing of Larry Cadman, esteemed copywriter and former member of the Board of Directors of The One Club for Art and Copy. Larry died in New York on February 19, 2007 after a brave battle with lung cancer. Born in 1942 in Coldwater, Michigan, Larry graduated from the University of Michigan. He moved to New York and enjoyed a career here as an award winning copywriter. An avid golfer and published playwright, he leaves a host of loyal friends who will dearly miss his integrity, friendship and tremendous talent. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife Caren and sister Kandy Aker. Donations may be made to the American Lung Association.
