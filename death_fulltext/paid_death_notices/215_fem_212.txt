        BURSTEIN--Ellen. The entire community of Metropolitan Montessori School mourns the passing of Ellen Burstein. Ms. Burstein had a special relationship with the students of our school. She spoke at the 2003 graduation ceremony, visited the school occasionally and even received the students in her home. Our school has lost a dear special friend who taught all of us many important lessons. By speaking openly of the affliction that confined her to a wheel chair she taught us to face challenges head on. We will always remember her amazing spirit and love of life.
