        ALGER - David. The Chapin School is deeply saddened by the loss of David Alger, an outstanding trustee and a true friend of the school. He served on the Board of Trustees with dedication and distinction and touched the lives of so many in the Chapin community. He will be sorely missed. Our deepest sympathy goes to his wife, Josie, and his daughters, Cristy and Roxana. Cera B. Robbins, President, Board of Trustees Sandra J. Theunick, Head of School
