        MOORE-Gordon H., physician and resident of Houston, Texas, died Friday, November 5, 1999, at the age of 50 from complications related to the HIV virus. Dr. Moore began his profession in the practice of pediatric medicine and later held the position of Medical Director of the McGregor Clinics. His personal life included extensive travel throughout the world and devoted service to Trinity Episcopal Church in Houston. While family and friends knew of his dedicated service to others, most were unaware of the extent to which he lived this vocation-the establishment of charitable organizations, actual service within those organizations, and most profoundly in the way he quietly touched the lives of those he knew. ''Gordon Moore was the most selfless person I have ever known. He was a warm, caring individual and I have lost a great friend,'' said a friend and colleague. Dr. Moore was a Founding Director of the Episcopal Medical Missions Board and served on a mission to the Dominican Republic, providing medical services to the poor. He was also a founder of the Emergency Aid Coalition and volunteered many hours of service in inner city clinics. Ever faithful to the church's life and mission, Dr. Moore served on the Vestry of Trinity Episcopal Church, where he shared his vision of the church as an open, diverse community for all people. An outstanding teacher and scholar, he was noted for his Bethel Bible instruction at both Trinity and Palmer Episcopal churches. ''He found great joy in sharing. He saw Christ in all people,'' remarked a student and fellow parishioner. Dr. Moore is survived by his partner of 20 years, Kevin Stevens; his parents, Mr. and Mrs. William Moore; his brothers, Scott Moore and Jerry Moore, and their families. Memorials may be sent to the Episcopal Medical Missions Board, c/o St. Francis Episcopal Church, 345 Piney Point, Houston, Texas 77024.
