        MENDELSON-Joseph L. The faculty, administration and board of directors of the Jewish Theological Seminary record with sorrow the passing of Joseph L. Mendelson. An honorary and former long-time board member and a member of the Seminary's Society of Fellows, he was a staunch JTS supporter. He and his late wife, Martha, endowed the Joseph and Martha Mendelson Professorship in American Jewish History and they underwrote the creation of the Seminary's Mendelson Convocation Center. He was active in local affairs and at Adas Israel Congregation in Washington, D.C., where he worshipped and will be sorely missed by his community. May his memory be for a blessing. Ismar Schorsch, Chancellor Gershon Kekst, Board Chairman
