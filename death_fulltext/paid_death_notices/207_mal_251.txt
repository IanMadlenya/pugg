        KAHANE--Rabbi Solomon. Beloved rabbi of the West Side Jewish Center for 38 years. A teacher and role model to the entire Jewish people. Rarely does one man possess such a combination of compassion and intellect. He was a best friend to all of us. His memory is an inspiration to us all. May G-d, blessed be He, grant him the eternal reward he so richly deserves. The officers and members of the West Side Jewish Center mourn his loss together with his family and friends.
