        WURZBURGER-Walter S., Rabbi. We are so profoundly saddened by the passing of Walter, and we grieve that we only had so short a time to get to know this very noble and distinguished man. His brilliance, warmth, wit and elegance touched us greatly. To dear Naomi, Benjamin and Mindy, Myron, Linda and Michael and our beloved son-in-law Josh and our dearest daughter Leah, our hearts and thoughts are with you now and always. Diane and Sion Elalouf
