        BARLIANT--Samuel. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) mourn the loss of Samuel Barliant of Chicago and Boca Raton, Fla. A Technion Guardian who reached the highest level of commitment to the ATS, the Technion and Israel, and a devoted member of the Chicago Chapter board of directors, he transmitted his profound sense of dedication to his children and grandchildren. These include his daughters, Diana J. Barliant, a member of the ATS Board of Regents, a former national board member, and a vital force in the San Diego Chapter; Barbara Sonnenblick and her husband Paul, active members of the Northern California Chapter, and their daughter Beth; and Laurel Burgess. A lawyer and entrepreneur, Mr. Barliant founded Barliant & Company during the Depression and turned it into a leader in equipment for the food processing industry. He made his first visit to the Technion in 1988 under the guidance of his longtime Chicago friend, past ATS president Leonard H. Sherman. Subsequently, along with his late first wife Dorothy and her mother, he dedicated the Dorothy Turner Barliant/Nathan Turner Dormitory. Later, he was a leading supporter of the Florence and Jack Bellock Southern Region Dormitory and provided generously for the Technion through a major planned gift. Along with his second wife Tania, he was recognized with the Albert Einstein Award, the highest ATS honor. We extend our sincere condolences to Tania, Mr. Barliant's daughters, Diana J. Barliant, Barbara Sonnenblick and Laurel Burgess, and the entire Barliant family. American Society for Technion-Israel Institute of Technology Stephen A.
