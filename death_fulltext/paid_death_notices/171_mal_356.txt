Khalil's enthusiasm for restoring beautiful monuments and works of art, his tireless ability to bring us new friends, his imagination & flair in creating wonderful events here and abroad, and his generosity in supporting us financially and morally, have made the deepest possible mark on us personally, on our organization, and indeed on the City of Venice. We offer our deepest sympathy to his family and all his friends who loved him. Countess Cristiana Brandolini, International Chairman Lawrence D. Lovett, Chairman Marchesa Barbara Berlingeri, Marchesa Lesa Marcello, Mrs. Donald K. Miller, Mrs. Lawrence Copley Thaw, Vice Presidents Alexis Gregory, Treasurer
