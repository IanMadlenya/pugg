        KORN-Mrs. Richard Kaye. The board and staff of Planned Parenthood of New York City are deeply saddened by the death of our honorary board member, Mrs. Richard Kaye Korn. Peggy joined the PPNYC board in the late 1940s and served with distinction on nearly every agency committee. She inspired generations of board members by extraordinary generosity and her enthusiasm for fundraising. We will long remember Peggy for her unwavering commitment to this agency, and the health and rights of women in New York City. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to her entire family. Wendy Mackenzie, Chair, PPNYC Board of Directors Alexander C. Sanger, President Barry Ensminger, Exec. Director
