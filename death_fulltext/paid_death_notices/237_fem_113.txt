        RUANE--Joy. Save the Children and its Board of Trustees, senior management team, its staff and children in need in the U.S. and around the world mourn the passing of Joy M. Ruane, widow of former Save the Children donor William J. Ruane, on October 12, 2006. Through their visionary and extraordinarily generous philanthropy always conducted with characteristic modesty and privacy, Joy and Bill played a great role in enhancing the lives and well-being of millions of children. Their humanitarianism and concern for children have and will continue to help Save the Children make a profound difference in children's health, education and ability to overcome poverty in rural America. Children have lost a strong ally and we extend our deepest condolences to her daughter Paige, son Thomas, stepson William, stepdaughter Elizabeth, her brother, Stephen Mehrbach, her sister, Doreen Errikson, and to her four granddaughters.
