        LEVAVY-Zvi. On June 20, 1999. Advisor, teacher, community leader and visionary. Happily and harmoniously married to the late Berenice (Bardin) for over 63 years. Adored and adoring brother of Sarah Weiss, beloved father of Bardin (and Sue-Ellen), doting grandfather of Raphael and Sara Beth. A fount of compassion, wisdom and sound judgement to the many who sought his counsel whether as certified public accountant, community leader or trusted friend. Loved, respected-and now missed-by all who knew him. Contributions in his memory may be made to the Zvi & Berenice Levavy Fund of the Jewish Federation of Greater Middlesex County.
