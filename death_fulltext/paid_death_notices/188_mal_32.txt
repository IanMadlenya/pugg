        ETTINGER-Samuel of New York and North Miami Beach-Passed away on the morning of September 2, 2002. He was 95 years old. Beloved husband of Dr. Hana Heller, (nee Levine), and the late Charlotte Ettinger, (nee Adler). Cherished father of Philip O. Ettinger, MD, and Stephen J. Ettinger, DVM, and grandfather of Alyssa, Jonathan, Nicole, Andrew, Michael, Robert and Richard. Affectionate father-in-law of Roxanne and Patricia Ettinger, and the late Sandra Ettinger.

Samuel was predeceased by his six sisters, Charlotte, Pauline, and Fanny Ettinger, Eve Bloom, Belle Allenberg and Ella Stone, and by his brother George. Samuel's name will surely ring a bell among the many thousands of men, women, and young people whose lives were touched and forever changed by their contact with him over so many years-as teacher and principal in the New York Public School System, and as owner and director of Camp Towanda in Honesdale, Pennsylvania.

Samuel, the fortune is ours to have known and loved you for so long. You will be deeply missed!
