        DARLING-Robert C., M.D. Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center mourns the passing of our colleague, Robert C. Darling, M.D. He began his long, distinguished career at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center as a medical intern in 1935. In 1945, he joined the faculty of Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons and of the Presbyterian Hospital. He served as Chairman of the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine from 1952 to 1973, and, in 1961, became the first Simon Baruch Professor and Chairman. Dr. Darling was considered a founding father in the field of rehabilitation medicine. He was an outstanding teacher, scholar and clinician, devoted to rehabilitation medicine and the medical center. He served as an advisor and friend to generations of medical students and colleagues. We extend deep condolences to his children Thomas and Nancy. Memorial donations, in lieu of flowers, should be made to the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Columbia University for the Robert C. Darling Library in c/o John A. Downey, M.D., 180 Fort Washington Ave, Room HP167, New York, N.Y. 10032.
