        AITKEN - Russell Barnett. The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art join in mourning our universally respected Honorary Trustee and Benefactor Russell B. Aitken. His generosity was particulary important to the Museum's Department of Arms and Armor, some of whose renowned permanent galleries bear his name, and on whose Visiting Committee he served from 1969 until his death. A true renaissance man whose myriad accomplishments embraced the worlds of art, journalism, filmmaking, collecting, exploring the natural world, the conservation movement, and philanthropy, Russell Aitken was a devoted friend of the Museum whose ability to serve its public is the greater for his significant involvement and support.
