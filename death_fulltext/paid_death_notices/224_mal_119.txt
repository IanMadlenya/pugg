        WEISZ--John Alexander of New York City and Quiogue, L.I. died Sunday, September 11, 2005 at the age of 60. John is the beloved, and already dearly missed, husband of Barbara. He is the devoted and cherished father of Zachary and Zoe, the loving uncle of Barbara Percoco, Eric Mesecke and Keith Weisz, and the caring brother of Michael and Mary Weisz, Dr. Alice Weisz, Christine D'Esposito and Dr. Robert D'Esposito. He was a graduate of Xavier High School in New York City; received Bachelor of Civil Engineering degree from the University of Detroit and Master of Business Administration from Hofstra University. After graduation, he served as a First Lieutenant in the United States Army in Vietnam, for which he received a Bronze Star. He retired three years ago from Clarion Partners, the firm he founded. John always had the unique ability of combining style, dignity, generosity and intelligence with humanity. He was always the gentleman. We will struggle for a long time to adjust to this enormous loss. It was too soon, and he was too young. In repose at Frank E.
