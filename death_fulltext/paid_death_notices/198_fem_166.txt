        BARSKY--Vita. Age 92 and a half, died on July 23, 2003. Wife of the late Dr. Edward K. Barsky and the late John J. Abt. Really special Mom of Angela Mortarotti. Delighted mother-in-law of Lionel Mortarotti and adoring aunt of Erika Roth. She was a union organizer, co-owner of the Cookery restaurant, fundraiser and a feisty political activist. Her life was filled with wonderful friends and many adventures. She had a terrific sense of humor and was one hell of a great lady. She will be truly missed. >>AD#
