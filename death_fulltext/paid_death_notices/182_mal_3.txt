        JACKSON-Lee. ''Direct Descendent of the Eight'' of the Ashcan School, died on February 19, in Southhampton, NY at the age of 93. He loved the human figure, male and female, especially in motion. He delighted in everyday things like the ''Noble Horse'' whether pulling a wagon or running the race of his life. He loved words, their derivatives and meanings. His romantic attitude was embracing of beauty and truth throughout his life, and he was a constant joy to me and all who knew him. Adele, his wife who loved him for 52 years.
