        NIEMEYER -- Jack. The Trustees, administration, staff, students, and alumni of Bank Street College of Education deeply mourn the passing of John H. Niemeyer, President Emeritus. His presidency of Bank Street, from 1956-1973, ushered the College onto the national stage, and laid the groundwork for its significant influence on American education. As President Emeritus and Life Trustee, Jack continued to play a central role in the shaping of the College and its pursuit of its mission, in a commitment that spanned nearly 50 years. Children in public schools across the nation, especially those in urban schools, have lost a passionate friend and advocate. And as for Bank Street, a long and pivotal chapter in our history has come to an end. We are the poorer for its closing, but will always be the richer for all the years that Jack devoted to the College. Augusta Souza Kappner, President Sue A. Kaplan, Chair Board of Trustees
