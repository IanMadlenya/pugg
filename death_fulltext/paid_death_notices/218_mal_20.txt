        LITTLER--J. William, M.D. The entire family of St. Luke's and Roosevelt Hospitals, acknowledge with deep sadness the passing of our good friend, and long-time colleague, J. William Littler, M.D. Dr. Littler is often credited as one of the driving forces behind the establishment of the distinctive discipline of hand surgery in the US. When he established The Hand Surgery Unit at Roosevelt in 1950, no other such program existed in the country. A measure of his central role is the fact that many directors of hand surgery post-graduate training are alumni of the Roosevelt Program. Dr. Littler also served as a Trustee, and later, an Honorary Trustee of The St. Luke'sRoosevelt Board, and received countless honors and awards attesting to his surgical skills. He was greatly loved by his patients and all who knew him and worked with him. To his family, friends, and countless admirers, we extend heartfelt condolences. Morton P. Hyman, Chairman Board of Trustees Richard F. Daines, M.D., President and CEO Steven Z. Glickel, M.D, Director, The C.V. Starr Hand Surgery Center
