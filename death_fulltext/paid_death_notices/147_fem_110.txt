        BAUM-Ruth. The Board of Directors, staff, children and families of Northside Center for Child Development, Inc. note with great sadness the passing of our longtime friend and Board member, Ruth Baum. Ruth became part of the Northside family over 30 years ago and throughout that time fervently championed its cause. Ruth's dedication to the children of Northside and the Jane Allen Emil Library of Northside will always be remembered. We thank you for your many years of caring, kindness and commitment. You will be missed. Northside extends its deepest sympathy to the Baum Family.
        BAUM-Ruth. The staff of Windows on the World, Blackbird Restaurant, Wild Blue and the B.E. Restaurant Group join in extending our deepest sympathies to Charles and Jennifer, Hilary and Richard, and Edward and Lise, on the loss of their wonderful mother Ruth Baum. We loved and admired Ruth for her deep compassion, great warmth, sly humor and unflagging devotion to her family and friends. Her generous spirit, rollicking laugh and beautiful eyes will stay with us always.
