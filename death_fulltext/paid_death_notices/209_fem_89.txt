        ZAHN--Cele. (nee Bronfman). 102, of NYC, died peacefully at home, on May 4th. Her beloved husband Phillip Zahn, to whom she was blissfully married for 61 yrs, predeaceased her in 1985. Born August 2, 1901 and the last survivor of three sisters and a brother, she was an unassuming renaissance woman with a passion for the arts that she pursued until the end in her quest to find the beauty in life. An accomplished artist, sculptor, composer and pianist, she was blessed with perfect pitch, playing requests ''by ear'' until nearly 100. She is survived by her loving daughters, Ruth Brandt, and Joan Kaufman, her seven grandchildren, Robert, James, Gary and John Brandt, Leslie Kaufman Akst and Thomas and Scott Kaufman, her 16 great-grandchildren, Ryan, Austin, Zachary, Alexis, Taylor, Skylar, Barrie, Dylan, Jesse, Danielle, Alisa, Adam, Chloe, Alexis, Remy, and Tyler, and a wealth of wonderful memories. Her motto ''everything in moderation'' is strictly adhered to ''in moderation'' by the entire family who will miss her wit, wisdom, and sweet melody of life. Dream On.
