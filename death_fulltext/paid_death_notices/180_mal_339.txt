        FISHER-Robert P. International Silk Association (USA) mourns the passing, on January 22, 2002, of its Honorary President, Robert P. Fisher. Mr. Fisher served this association for many years and was one of the giants of the silk industry. Mr. Fisher touched us all in very personal ways. We extend our profound sympathies to his wife Greta, and to the entire Fisher family.
