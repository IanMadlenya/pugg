        BENJAMIN-Louis J. The officers, members & staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) express profound sorrow at the loss of Louis J. Benjamin of Sarasota, FL., an illustrious leader of our organization. As Technion Guardians, he and his wife Miriam demonstrated the highest level of commitment to the Technion, the ATS and Israel. They have been dedicated friends of the Technion since their first visit there in 1959. Among the few couples in Technion to be jointly honored with an Honorary Fellowship, in 1986, and individually with Honorary Doctorates in 1991 and 1993, they were affectionately referred to as ''Mr. and Mrs. Technion''. They organized the Society's Sarasota Chapter and have been leaders there for many years. Louis Benjamin was also a member of the National Board of Directors, Board of Regents, and the Technion International Board of Governors. Together they have supported many projects over the years including the Louis & Miriam Benjamin Chair in Computer and Communication Networks, the Louis & Miriam Benjamin/Sarasota Chapter Auditorium, two Sarasota Chapter Computer Laboratories and the Undergraduate Chemistry Laboratory. We extend heartfelt condolences to Miriam Benjamin and the entire Benjamin family. American Society for TechnionIsrael Institute of Technology Lawrence S. Jackier, President Irving A. Shepard, Chairman Melvyn H. Bloom, Exec. V.P. Milton Richter, Sarasota Chapter President Bruce Wertheimer, Sarasota Chapter Chairman Albert G. Effrat, Southern Region Director
