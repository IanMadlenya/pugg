        GOLDBERG-Rabbi Morton. We record with sorrow the passing of our beloved colleague, age 97. Ordained in 1925, he served as rabbi of Temple Beth El in Fall River, MA when he was called to the pulpit of Temple B'nai Israel in 1937 where he served until becoming rabbi emeritus in 1972. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his widow, Doris, daughter-in-law, Harriet, son-in-law, Irwin, grandchildren Steven, Stuart, Cathy and Jeffrey, and to all who were touched through his rabbinate. Rabbi Seymour L. Essrog, President Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Exec VP The Rabbinical Assembly
