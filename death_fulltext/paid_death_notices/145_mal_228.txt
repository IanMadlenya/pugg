        KENNER-Morton. The Trustees, Faculty and Staff of Mount Sinai School of Medicine and The Mount Sinai NYU Medical Center and Health System are profoundly saddened by the passing of Morton Kenner, who with his wife Edythe, was a generous supporter of The Mount Sinai Medical Center for many years. Long-time members of the Committee of 1000, Mr. and Mrs. Kenner have also supported a broad range of educational and clinical activities, including endowments in cardiology and pulmonary medicine. He will be remembered most fondly and he will be sorely missed. We extend deepest sympathy to his widow, Edythe, to his sons Martin, Peter, and Robert, and step-son Robert Safron, and to the entire family. Stephen M. Peck, Chairman John W. Rowe, MD, President Arthur H. Rubenstein, MBBCh, Dean Barry R. Freedman, Executive Vice President Theresa A. Bischoff, Executive Vice President KENNER-Morton. We mourn the loss of Morton Kenner, one of the original members of ''the game.'' Though his passion for debate and his incredible dry humor are no longer with us, his memory will be with us forever.
