        SOMMER-Esther. My beloved mother has joined my father Smitty and my sister Bonnie at rest, leaving me Elissa, her second daughter, alone in my grief. Mother is survived by the love of her life, her grandson Michael Samuel, named in blessed memory of my father and Zadie. Her sisters and brothers Minnie, Marilyn, Betty, and Ruth, Abe, David, and Mort also survive her. She was a founding member of United Leukemia Fund and an active member of Hadassah. My mother, my partner, my best friend will be missed more than words can express. Donations to Hadassah or a cancer research organization in her memory will be appreciated. The service will be held at Sherman's, 1283 Coney Island Ave, Brooklyn, 12 noon, Thursday, May 17th. Elissa Sommer
