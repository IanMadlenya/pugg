        HUMPHREY -- Mark Alton. Died at age 40 on September 17, 2003 in Bay Ridge, Bklyn. Born in Rome, N.Y., he grew up in Northwich, England returning to the U.S. in 1983. Master carpenter, musician, poet and catalyst, he left us at the happiest time of his life. He was working on a musical with his collaborator Dave Moran, crossing back and forth between the States and the U.K. In Northwich he is survived by his mother Joan, brothers and sister Michael, Dale and Arlene and in California, brother Richard, sisters Lorraine and Elizabeth, in New York by Tom Clark and Leo Overtoom, his associates in The Blacksmith Shop recording studio, his sidekicks Richie and the most famous dog on the lower east side Hoover and his partner Garrison Phillips. On the night of Mark's memorial at Avalon, his beloved upstate retreat, a comet streaked across the sky letting us know he was still brightening our way.
