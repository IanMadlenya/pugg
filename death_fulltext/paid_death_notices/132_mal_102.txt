        GILMAN-Howard. With great sadness, the Board of Directors and staff of Career Transition for Dancers note the loss of our dear friend, Howard Gilman. He loved dance and he loved dancers. He knew that our art form could only flourish in the long run if individual artists could also flourish, both during and after their dance careers. The lives that have been changed as a result of his caring and generosity are innumerable. We shall miss him. Cynthia Gregory, Chairman
