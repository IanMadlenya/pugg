        JAFFE--Matthew. May 31, 1921-August 23, 2005 in NYC. Loving and devoted husband to the late Vita for 46 years. Survived by his beloved children Dana, Byron and Robert; endearing grandchildren Benjamin, Hannah, Nathaniel and Vita; adoring daughtersin-law Kendra, Beth and devoted son-in-law Theodore; best friend and companion Marilyn Brunson. Matthew led a full and exciting life. He was one of a kind--no one will ever compare to him. He was a WWII pilot, a NYS Senator, owner of Matt Jaffe Associates and his greatest accomplishment was his family, providing and protecting them. Matthew showed us how to live and will be missed greatly by all of us forever. Services Thursday, August 25, 11:30 AM at The Riverside, 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, 212-362-6600.
