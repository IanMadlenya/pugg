        RAILEANU-Eufrosina. New York City Opera deeply mourns the passing of Eufrosina Raileanu, the principal violist in our orchestra since 1988. She was a greatly gifted musician who brought joy to her music making while continually striving for perfection. The courage and grace with which she fought her illness has been an inspiration to all of us. We extend our deepest sympathy to her family and her many friends. Paul Kellogg, General Director
