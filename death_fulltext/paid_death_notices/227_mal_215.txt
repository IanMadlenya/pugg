        TREVAS--Seymour. On December 17, 88 years old, after a long, rich life and a brief illness. The son of Anna and David Trevas, brother of Rita, he was born in The Bronx, raised in Far Rockaway, and graduated from Columbia University. He was the loving husband of the late Doris Trevas and cherished father of Marjorie Zolot and Carole Trevas Fleisher. Generous and playful, he was the beloved grandfather of Bruce Zolot, Deborah Zolot, Jake Fleisher, and Diana Fleisher, and he gave warmth and delight to his great-grandchildren, Gabriel and Jillian Zolot. He will also be missed by his sons-in-law Barry Zolot and Michael Fleisher, and grandchildren's spouses, Joan Zolot and Kevin Sher. Seymour was a businessman, an active member of Three Arrows Cooperative Society, an avid learner, and a passionate supporter of justice and social causes. His enjoyment of life--tennis, snorkeling, travel, connecting with people everywhere--was an inspiration. He is irreplaceable and will remain unforgettable for all who knew him.
