        BERNBAUM-Glenn. The patients and staff of the Center for Special Studies at the New York Presbyterian Hospital are shocked and saddened by the loss of our benefactor Glenn Bernbaum. Glenn was an intensely private man who downplayed his own contributions to the fight against AIDS. Yet his ability to rally some of the most powerful people in our community to the cause of the stigmatized and powerless was unique. That ability made a profound difference in the lives of thousands of New Yorkers with HIV. We will deeply miss his steadfast support and friendship. Jonathan L. Jacobs, M.D., Medical Director Samuel Merrick, M.D., Associate Medical Director Gerard Ilaria, Program Director
