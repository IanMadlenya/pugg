        ANDERSON--Madelyn Klein. With all our love, we mourn the passing of Madelyn Klein Anderson of New York, NY, age 79, on October 5, 2005. Her accomplishments were many. After graduating from Hunter College, she joined the military in 1954. She proudly served the U.S. Army WMSC, honorably discharged. After earning a Masters in Occupational Therapy from NYU, she went on to become Chief O.T. at Mount Sinai. Following the death of her husband, Douglas Anderson, in Vietnam, she spent a second fulfilling career as senior editor of non-fiction childrens books at Simon & Schuster. She was an awardwinning author of 19 non-fiction childrens books. The highlight of her writing career was a trip to Greenland with the U.S. Coast Guard. Throughout all, she remains the best Mommy to her son, Dr. Justin Lee Anderson and his wife Dr. Chani Anderson, the proudest grandma to Atara, age 6 and Alyza, age 3. She leaves us and her best friend, Barbara Sanders, to carry on her legacy.
