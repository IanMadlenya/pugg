        COOPER-Eli. We note with sorrow the passing of a great leader, a visionary whose Cooper Fellows program created a living legacy for present and future generations of Russian-speaking Jewish youth. May his memory be for a blessing. May his wife Harriet, his sons Douglas and Neil, and the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
