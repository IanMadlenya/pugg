        FONER-Jack. The officers and staff of 1199 National Health & Human Service Employees Union, SEIU/AFL-CIO mourn the death of Jack Foner, distinguished historian and fighter for human rights. The four Foner brothers-Jack, his late twin brother Phil, Moe, a founder of 1199, and Henry, a trade union leader-represent the finest traditions of the labor movement. We extend our condolences to the family. Dennis Rivera, President
