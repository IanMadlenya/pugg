        KATZENSTEIN - Esther. Our worldwide family mourns the loss of a dear and special lady, whose kindness touched so many, both in Eretz Yisrael and in her own community. Modesty & acts of tzedekah graced her life. For more than fifty years she was tireless in her efforts to provide quality health care to the people of Jerusalem. A supporter of the Ladies Auxiliary, she worked alongside her late husband Manfred, who was one of the original founders of the American Committee. Golden Founders of the medical center, the Katzensteins generously supported the Annual Dinner and Annual Concert. Our sincerest condolences to Maud Carlebach, Rabbi Edwin Katzenstein and Joan Thau. May they and the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. American Committee for Shaare Zedek Jerusalem Med. Ctr.
