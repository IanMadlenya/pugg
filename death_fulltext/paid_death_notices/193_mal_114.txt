        DEUSCHLE-Kurt W., MD. The Mount Sinai Medical Center mourns the passing of Kurt W. Deuschle, MD. Known as the ''father of community medicine'', Dr. Deuschle defined the discipline, founded the first department of community medicine in a medical school in the US, and, in 1968 founded the nation's first urban department of community medicine at Mount Sinai. He served as the Ethel H. Wise Professor and Chairman of the Department of Community and Preventive Medicine at Mount Sinai School of Medicine until 1990. His commitment to empowering people through community medicine grounded in the priorities of the community led to better health for populations in locals ranging from East Harlem to Appalachia. His contributions to medicine and society live on in the generations of clinicians and researchers he inspired to follow in his footsteps. We extend condolences to his colleagues, his wife Jeanne and his children & grandchildren. Peter W. May Chairman of the Boards of Trustees, The Mount Sinai Medical Ctr Kenneth I.
