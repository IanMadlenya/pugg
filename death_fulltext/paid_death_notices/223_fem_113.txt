        KRAMER--Lola. The Officers, Board of Directors and staff of the Lola & Saul Kramer Senior Services Agency located on the Marilyn & Stanley M. Katz Seniors Campus, mark with great sadness the passing of Lola Kramer, the namesake of our agency and a leader in our Jewish community. Her unwavering support of the Joseph L. Morse Geriatric Center and the Kramer Senior Services Agency will forever serve as an inspiration to all those who care for and are dedicated to serving and protecing the elderly Jewish population of Palm Beach County. To Saul, her family and loved ones, we express our profound sympathy. Stanley M. Katz, President of the Lola & Saul Kramer Senior Services Agency
