        ROSENTHAL - Franz. The American Academy For Jewish Research expresses its profound sorrow over the death of its distinguished Fellow, Professor Franz Rosenthal, of Yale University. Prof. Rosenthal not only made an enormous contribution to the study of Islam, but simultaneously pursued interests in Aramaic and Jewish Studies, bridging both fields with his impressive erudition and intellectual curiosity. He will be sorely missed by his many colleagues and students. David Ruderman, President American Academy For Jewish Research
