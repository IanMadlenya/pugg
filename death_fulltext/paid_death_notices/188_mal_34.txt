        HITTMAN-Fred. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society deeply mourn the loss of Fred Hittman of Baltimore, MD. A widely respected and beloved pillar of support in our organization, he first served as president of the Baltimore Chapter 25 years ago, a position he graciously accepted and effectively managed again for the past three years. An engineer and founder of a medical manufacturing company, Mr. Hittman and his wife, Sandy, funded the Johns HopkinsTechnion Center in Biomedical Engineering and the Fred and Sandy Hittman Gifted Student Fund. They reached the highest level of support as Technion Guardians. Mr. Hittman's devoted leadership and the warmth and zealousness of his support for Israel and the Technion will be greatly missed. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Sandy, their children and grandchildren. American Technion Society Evelyn Berger, President Lawrence S. Jackier Chairman, Board of Directors Melvyn H. Bloom Executive Vice President Philip E. Klein, Co-Chairman Baltimore Chapter Howard Rosenbloom, CoChairman, Baltimore Chapter Natalie Feinblum Director, Baltimore Chapter
