        ELLIS -- Abraham. The trustees, faculty and staff of NYU Medical Center note with sadness the passing of our cherished friend, devoted supporter and generous benefactor, Abraham Ellis. Abe's analytical mind and keen sense of humor were greatly valued by the members of the NYU Medical Center community. Alongside his beloved wife, Nan, Abe has played an important role in the life of NYU Medical Center in the past and has generously provided for its future. As with his many friends of a lifetime, we are grateful for the long association with this exceptional man. We send our sincere condolences to Nan and other family members. Robert M. Glickman, M.D. Dean, New York University School of Medicine CEO, NYU Hospitals Center
