        AVERICK-Harold Bernard. The officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Harold Bernard Averick, who expressed his commitment to Jewish and humanitarian causes through the Averick Philanthropic Foundation. His beloved niece, Pamela, helped Harold create the Foundation, and embraced her uncle's devotion to our community through her leadership on behalf of UJA-Federation. Pamela is currently the chair of the Business and Professional Women's Division of our Women's Campaign. A true leader in his community, Harold will be sorely missed by all of those who knew him. We extend our deepest sympathies to Pamela, and to Mr. Averick's entire family. Larry Zicklin, President Morris W. Offit, Chair of the Board John S. Ruskay, Exec VP & CEO
