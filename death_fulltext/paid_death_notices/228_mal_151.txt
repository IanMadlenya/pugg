        REMIN--Morris, who died on January 12th at age 92 at home in North Miami Beach, FL, was the founder of the former Remin's Dress Shop of New Rochelle, NY. One of the original off-price stores, Remin's drew customers from the Tri-state area and beyond for couture and designer fashion. Born in 1913 in Poland, Morris came to this country at age six. He eloped at age 21 with the love of his life, Rusty, with whom he celebrated his 71st anniversary this past December. He also leaves behind his son, Robert, daughter, Diane, and grandchildren: Daniel, Jeffrey and Elaina. Even after surviving, against all odds, a major stroke almost 50 years ago which left him paralyzed on his right side, Morris remained an avid card player, sports enthusiast (eternally grateful to the '72 Dolphins) and spirited man who amused us all with his colorful language and inspired us all with his zest for life. In his honor, the family distributed, for free, over 75,000 -MR cardholders - to hospitals, nursing homes and individuals across the US. Services will be held Sunday January 15th at 11am at the Hebrew Institute of White Plains, 20 Greenridge Ave, White Plains, NY. Memorial contributions may be made to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research. Morris, you're the one who is, indeed, ''unbelievable.''
