        ADLER--Seymour. Born December 17, 1919, in New York. Passed away peacefully December 31, 2003, at his home in Los Angeles surrounded by his family. He is survived byhis wife of 42 years, Ioe, children Lelah and John, and grandchildren Isabel, Benjamin and Norah. Raised in Brooklyn, and graduated from Purdue University in 1941 with a degree in engineering, Mr. Adler moved to California in 1944 and spent the war years as an aircraft engineer with Lockheed in Burbank, CA. He began moonlighting at Mattel Toys, and eventually, over a 30 year career, became Vice President of several divisions. With Mattel, he opened factories in Asia and Europe and was instrumental in the early production of classic toys including Barbie and Hot Wheels. Mr. Adler also founded numerous business ventures including toymaker Leonis, and a real estate concern, Adler Investment Company. He loved working and never fully retired. At home, Mr. Adler enjoyed keeping house and garden in meticulous condition and had a great passion for music, especially opera. More than anything, he enjoyed spending time with his family, and especially his wife, the love of his life. He kept an active mind to the end, always ready with an appropriate quotation, and continuing to read books and newspapers voraciously. A memorial service to celebrate his life will be held at 12 noon, on Tuesday, Janaury 6, 2004, at the Adler residence in Los Angeles. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the American Cancer Society. Inquiries to Transitions Funeral Service, 800-869-7984.
