        SCHWARTZ--James H. Columbia University Medical Center lost one of its leaders in neurobiology with the passing of James H. Schwartz, M.D., Ph.D. Dr. Schwartz was Professor of Physiology & Cellular Biophysics, Psychiatry, and Neurology (in the Center for Neurobiology and Behavior) at the College of Physicians & Surgeons. Dr. Schwartz joined Columbia in 1974 when he and Nobelist Eric Kandel moved their collaborative research from NYU to P&S and the New York State Psychiatric Institute. Their collaboration is credited with contributing to the modern transformation of electrophysiology into molecular neuroscience. Dr. Schwartz was one of the original editors of the extraordinary textbook in neuroscience, ''Principles in Neural Science,'' which will soon be published in its fifth edition. Dr. Schwartz left an important legacy in neuroscience at Columbia, and we were proud to have him as a colleague and mentor. We extend our sympathies to his family. Gerald D. Fischbach, M.D. Executive Vice President, Columbia University Medical Center Dean, College of Physicians & Surgeons
