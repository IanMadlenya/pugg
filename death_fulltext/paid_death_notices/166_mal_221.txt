        SMITH-James J., M.D. 88. Former director of the Nuclear Medicine Service for the Veterans Administration, pioneer in the fields of Endocrinology and nuclear medicine, and devoted husband of the late Beatrix Goldzieher Smith, M.D., died on September 9 in Washington, D.C. He was the first person to describe the uses of ultrasound in medical diagnosis, and the first to describe and demonstrate that alcoholism is a genetic inborn error of metabolism. Dr. Smith showed, also for the first time, the phenomenon of mixed cerebral dominance and metabolic disturbances in patients with dyslexia. He developed innovative and important new approaches to treatment in all these fields. Before moving to Washington D.C., he had an active practice in New York City as well as prominent hospital and university appointments. James Smith was a keenly original thinker and brilliant diagnostician, a compassionate healer who combined analytical and intuitive skills to resolve seemingly intractable puzzles of illness. Forward thinking and visionary, he had a gift for seeing things not only as they were but as they could be. During World War II, Dr. Smith was Chief of Medical Intelligence for the OSS (Office of Strategic Services) in Europe. James J. Smith is survived by two sisters, his children Briged Smith, Jennifer Smith, Andrew Smith, son-in-law Samuel Rubin, and two grandchildren, Clara and Julia Rubin-Smith. His funeral was at Arlington National Cemetery. Contributions may be made to the Hospice of Washington and Doctors Without Borders. Condolences may be sent to the family , c/o Jennifer F. Smith, Box 589, Belmont MA 02478.
