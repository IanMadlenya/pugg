Pines, Clinical Professor of Medicine Emeritus at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University and former Attending Physician at New YorkPresbyterian Hospital. Dr. Pines graduated from Columbia College in 1937 and from the College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1942, did his house staff training at The Presbyterian Hospital, and had been a beloved member of our faculty for 53 years. He was a meticulous, tender, and selfless physician with particular expertise in diabetes, and a gentle and devoted teacher who left an indelible mark on generations of medical students and house staff. Our heartfelt thoughts go out to his wife Toussia, his daughter Deborah, and his sons Jeffrey and Jonathan. Myron L. Weisfeldt, M.D. Chairman, Dept. of Medicine Columbia University
