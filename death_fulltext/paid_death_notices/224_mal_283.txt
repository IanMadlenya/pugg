        VLAMIS--Steve ''Stamatis'' on September 26. Born in Andros, Greece, in the village of Aprovatro, November 2, 1914. He moved to Athens at age 11 to begin his lifetime career in the food business. At 21, he entered the Greek Navy. After his service tour, he joined the Merchant Marine service as Chief Cook. In the late 30's, he debarked his ship in Galveston, Texas, making his way to New York City and his first restaurant job in America. A few years later, while managing an Upper East Side tavern, he met his future wife, Anne Dalechek, whom he married shortly after. They were married 65 years. Together they opened Steve's Restaurant, a luncheonette that became a mainstay in the neighborhood, famous for its home cooking from WWII years until 1988 when Steve retired to spend more time with his family. He also owned Cafe Taurino, a favorite Italian nightspot under the Queensboro Bridge. He was a loyal supporter and parishioner of Holy Trinity Greek Cathedral, 337 East 74th St, Manhattan, where church services will be held. His greatest gifts to his family was his love of life and learning, his stoicism, his compassionate and forgiving nature, his life-schooled wisdom, and rugged independence. He is survived by his son Anthony, daughter Susan, and grandson Steven Alexander Vlamis. Friends may call Wednesday, 2-4 and 7-9PM at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Ave (at 81st St.). Funeral service Thursday, 11AM, Holy Trinity Greek Cathedral. Interment Cypress Hills Cemetery.
