        SOLOWAY-Alan M., of Boynton Beach, FL; formerly of Merrick, NY and Cliffside Park, NJ, age 83. He will always be loved and remembered by his family for his spiritual contribution to their lives, his gentleness, kindness and inner strength. Beloved husband of Mildred, loving father of Richard, Peter and David, loving father-inlaw of Donna and Chells and delighted grandfather of Steven. His aesthetic soul was of a highly creative nature which distinguished him in his field of art direction in Advertising. The world and our lives will be diminished without him and he will be greatly missed. Private services were held on May 25.
        SOLOWAY-Alan M. The Auxiliary of Tisch Hospital, NYU Medical Center, extends condolences to our President, Donna Soloway, and her husband Richard, on the passing of Richard's father. Our thoughts are with you.
