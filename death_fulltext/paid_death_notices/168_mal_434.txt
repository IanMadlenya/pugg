        SIEGEL-Louis, M.D. We are profoundly saddened by the death of our beloved brother-in-law and uncle Dr. Louis Siegel, who passed away on Monday, January 29. Our hearts go out to his most devoted wife Pearl, his loving son Burton (Suzanne), daughter Rosalie (Jeffrey) and Ellen, and his most precious grandchildren Jared and Emily. He was a most intelligent and compassionate human being and will be sadly missed by all who knew and loved him. The Rehr, Barish, and Egnuss Families.
