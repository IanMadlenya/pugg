        ANGER-Per. 1913-2002. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum deeply mourns the passing of Per Anger. As second secretary at the Swedish legation in Budapest during World War II, Anger participated in efforts to rescue Hungarian Jews from arrest and deportation. As a key associate he worked alongside legendary hero and rescuer Raoul Wallenberg, and is credited with saving thousands of lives from 1944 until the end of the war in May 1945. Following the war, Anger continued his diplomatic career, serving as Swedish ambassador to Australia and Canada. In addition, he initiated efforts to search for Wallenberg, an issue that remained a driving focus of his life, and remained an active human rights advocate. In 1982 he was recognized by Yad Vashem as one of the Righteous Among the Nations, and was awarded the Hungarian Republic's Order of Merit in 1995. The Museum expresses its deepest condolences to his family and friends. Fred S. Zeidman, Chairman Ruth B. Mandel, Vice Chair Sara J. Bloomfield, Director United States Holocaust Memorial Museum
