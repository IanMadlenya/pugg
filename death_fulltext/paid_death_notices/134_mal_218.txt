        EPSTEIN-Jacob. A dear friend and fellow music lover joins family members and countless friends of all ages in noting the passing of an extraordinary human being. I will sorely miss his keen wit, long-standing commitment to dignity and respect for all human beings, and profound and unquenchable interest in the world around him. It was with a deep sense of loss but also a quiet joy that I learned of Jacob's recent departure from this transitory life to rejoin, Ruth, his beloved wife, companion, comrade & sole-mate. Both were once-in-a-life-time friends who deeply enriched the lives of all who knew them. Jacob was lovingly cared for by Ruth's grandniece, for whom he had the greatest affection and held in the highest esteem. I will cherish his friendship & his memory forever. Karalenne Gayle
