        DE LAND-Colin. The owners and staff of The Armory Show, The International Fair of New Art, mourn the loss of co-founder, colleague and friend, Colin de Land. Colin was an artist, gallerist, and a true visionary in the international contemporary art world for over two decades. Together with Matthew Marks, Paul Morris and his late wife Pat Hearn, Colin established The Armory Show and its predecessor, the Gramercy International Contemporary Art Fair. We will greatly miss his foresight, conviction and unique perspective. Through The Armory Show we hope to continue to honor his memory and legacy. Katelijne De Backer, Director Timothy H. Smith, Manager Director
