        REES-Mina S. The faculty, staff, students and alumni of Hunter College mourn the passing of Dr. Mina S. Rees, a 1923 Hunter alumna who became an internationally known mathematician and nationally prominent educator. A member of the Hall of Fame of our Alumni Association, Dr. Rees served the College for many years, first as a mathematics instructor and, after WWII, as dean of students. During the war and in the immediate post war years, she worked for the Government, where she helped to direct research in modern mathematics for the war effort, and later headed the mathematics branch of the Office of Naval Research, and served as deputy director of the ONR's Division of Science and Mathematics. In 1961, she became the first dean of graduate studies at CUNY and she was the founding president of the CUNY Graduate School and University Center. An innovative thinker whose ideas had a profound influence on mathematics education and the development of computer technology, she was the first woman to be elected president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. We are proud of our association with Dr. Rees and we send sincerest condolences to her family. David A. Caputo, President
