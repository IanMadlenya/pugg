        KERN--Marvin. The Trustees and staff of the Riverdale Y mourn the loss of our former treasurer, longtime trustee, and esteemed advisor. Marvin was a ''mensch''. We will miss his devotion to our agency. May his wife, Florence, and children Donald and Sharon be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. January Akselrad, President Judy Kaufthal, Chair Simon Jaffe, Exec. Dir.
