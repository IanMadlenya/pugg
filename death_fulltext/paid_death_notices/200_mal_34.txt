        MOORE--Harry Clare, Sr. The Board of Directors and staff of the Lyford Cay Foundation, Inc. and The Canadian Lyford Cay Foundation are deeply saddened by the death of our friend Harry C. Moore, Sr. Mr. Moore became a Director of the Lyford Cay Foundation in 1979. He served as Treasurer from 1990 to 1993, as President from 1990 to 1995, as Chairman from 1995 through 2002 when he retired from the day-to-day administration of the Foundation to serve as Honorary Chairman. He also served as a Director of The Canadian Lyford Cay Foundation from 1990 through 2002. Mr. Moore was instrumental in the development of the Foundation's extensive tertiary level scholarship programs for Bahamian students studying in the US, Canada, UK, Caribbean and The Bahamas and was the driving force behind the Foundation's endowment fundraising efforts. His generosity of spirit, his passionate commitment to the Foundations and his strength provided a model for us all. He was an inspiration and will be missed by many. Our deepest sympathies to Monique and all of his family. Manuel J. Cutillas, Chairman Lyford Cay Foundation, Inc. Loretta A. Rogers, President The Canadian Lyford Cay Foundation
