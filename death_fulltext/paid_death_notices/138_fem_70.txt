        KRAMER-Lissi. Left us on July 8, 1998. She was the devoted wife of the late Henry H., and the loving mother of Fred and Madeline Kramer, Ernest and Susan Kramer, Anne and Paul Strauss. She adored her grandchildren, Valerie, Andrea, Martin, Diana, Lisa, David, Tracy and Richard, and their spouses, and her great grandchildren, Aaron, Seth, Allyson, Matthew, Andrew, Natalie, Lily and Stephen. They will always remember their ''Omi'' with great affection. Lissi was a valiant woman who cherished her family and was faithful to her many friends. She was an inspiration to us all and her memory will live from generation to generation.
