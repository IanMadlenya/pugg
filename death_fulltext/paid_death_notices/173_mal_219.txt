        RIESEL-Mel. Beloved husband, son, brother, brother-in-law and uncle. A kind, caring, decent human being who was genuinely liked and respected by all who knew him. They don't make 'em any better. He left a void that cannot be filled. Donations in his memory may be made to The American Diabetes Association.
