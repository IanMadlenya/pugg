        SALLES-Dr. Walther Moreira. The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art, along with the members of its International Council and Chairman's Council, note with great sorrow the passing of Dr. Walther Moreira Salles in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He will be remembered for his dignity, gracious courtesy and his lifelong commitment to the arts. He combined these attributes with a passion for collecting and a generous involvement with the causes closest to his heart. Walther's wonderful presence and gracious spirit will be sorely missed by all whose lives he touched. David Rockefeller, Chairman Emeritus Ronald S. Lauder, Chairman Agnes Gund, President Glenn D. Lowry, Director The Museum of Modern Art, NY Sir Brian Urquhart, Chairman Jo Carole Lauder, President The International Council of The Museum of Modern Art
