        OLNICK--Harvey. The Musicians, Trustees, and Staff of The Marlboro Music School and Festival, note with sadness the passing of Harvey Olnick, Administrative Director in 1956 and 1957, and Trustee and Emeritus Trustee for over forty years. His passion for Marlboro and his organizational strengths had enormous impact on the Music School and Festival in its early years, and created an invaluable structure for the Organization.
