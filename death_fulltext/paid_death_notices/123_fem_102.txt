        LEIBOWITZ - Nechama. We mourn the loss of a revered Torah scholar and teacher of teachers. She broke new ground in Bible study that impacted students worldwide. She taught the true meaning of love for the Land of Israel, the Jewish People, each individual member, and the Torah that guided her life. She will remain a beacon of light for many generations of her spiritual children. Ma'ayanot High School for Girls Esther Krauss, Principal
