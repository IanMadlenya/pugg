        SPAISMAN-Zypora. I mourn, together with her friends and family, the tragic passing of this celebrated Yiddish actress, friend, and colleague, first at the Folksbiene Theater and, most recently, at the Yiddish Public Theater, which she created two years ago to rave reviews. Zypora, I will miss your midnight phone calls. Irene S. Wolk, Advisory Comm. Yiddish Public Theater
