        GOLDFINE-Pauline. The Board of Directors, residents and staff of the Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale mourn with profound sorrow the death of Pauline Goldfine, beloved wife of the late William Goldfine. Pauline and Willie were true and deeply valued friends of the Hebrew Home; Pauline as a Founder and long time Leader of the Plaza League Auxiliary, and Willie, who as President, was instrumental in the historical move from Harlem and the development of the Home's Riverdale campus. Pauline's friendship, her warmth, kindess, vivacious spirit and generosity shall be greatly missed by all of us. We extend our sincere sympathy to her daughters: Joyce Walzer and Carol Fain Walters, son-in-law Richard Walzer, grandchildren Susan, Andrew and Janet Walzer, Barbara, Eric and Katherine Fain and her great grandchildren.
