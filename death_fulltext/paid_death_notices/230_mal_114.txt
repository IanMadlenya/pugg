        HOFFMAN--Israel, DDS. Died on March 4, two days shy of his 94th birthday, in Boston. Survived by Sylvia (nee Goldberg), his wife of 65 years, daughters Amy Feldman (Richard) and Ellen Hoffman (Ken Loveday), grandchildren Eric Feldman (Michelle) and Rebecca Micucci (Michael), and great granddaughter Isabella. He served as an Air Force captain in North Africa and Italy during WWII, returning to practice dentistry in Elmhurst, Queens until age 79. A 54-year resident of Beechhurst, he will be lovingly remembered for his scientific curiosity, passion for gardening and--until his last day--wry sense of humor. Memorial donations may be made to the National MS Society, 101A First Avenue, Suite 6, Waltham, MA. 02451.
