        O'NEIL-Thomas F. The officers, Board of Directors and members of The American Ireland Fund have learned with profound regret of the death of Thomas F. O'Neil, a founding member of the American Irish Foundation (subsequently merged with the Ireland Fund to become The American Ireland Fund.) Since its inception in 1972, the O'Neil Family has annually funded the AIF Literary Award, designed to enable young Irish writers to devote time to develop his or her work. It honors, too, appropriate authors, poets and playwrights whose lifetime contributions have so enriched Ireland's cultural heritage. We extend our deepest sympathy to Mrs. Claire O'Neil, to our fellow Board Member, Shane, and to all the O'Neil Family. The American Ireland Fund
