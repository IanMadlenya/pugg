        MEGGITT--Mervyn. Students and colleagues mourn the death of Dr. Mervyn Meggitt, Distinguished Professor and Professor Emeritus at Queens College and the Graduate Center, City University of New York. From 1953 to 1979 Dr Meggitt carried out pioneering anthropological research in Central Australia and the New Guinea Highlands. His beautifully written classic ethnographies of the Walbiri and Enga peoples set standards that anthropologists still attempt to emulate. His widow, Joan Meggitt, accompanied him on all his field research.
