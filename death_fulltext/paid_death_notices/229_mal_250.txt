        GEWIRTZ - Julius. Boys Town Jerusalem mourns with profound sorrow the passing of a most cherished member of its extended family. Julie (''Yidel''), a Chai Founder together with his partner in life, Hermine, was a respected founding member of our Board of Directors and also served with distinction as its Treasurer. Julie perpetuated a legacy of Ahavas Yisrael--Am Yisrael, Eretz Yisrael and Toras Yisrael--reflecting his lineage from a sainted rabbinic family, first demonstrated when, as a child scarcely seven years old, he waved a ''pushke'' at subway riders for Keren Kayemet to benefit Jewish settlement in Israel. We extend heartfelt condolences to Julie's wife Hermine, who in his own words, he described as ''the most wonderful supportive wife, who is also my dearest and best friend'', daughters Nancy and Joyce, grandchildren, great-granddaughter and the entire family. Rabbi Moshe Linchner, Dean Raphael Benaroya, Chairman Michael J. Scharf, President Josh Weston, Hon. Chairman Rabbi Ronald Gray, Exec. VP $(6$)GEWIRTZ -- Julie. Deepest sympathy to the Gewirtz family who, as everyone else who knew him, will forever be blessed with the memory and inspiration of this most gracious, honorable, kind man of extraordinary wisdom, sensitivity and humility.
