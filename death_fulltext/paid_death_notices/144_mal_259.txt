        COHEN-Henry. The Board of Directors and staff of UJA-Federation of New York note with deep sorrow the death of Henry Cohen, a long-time friend and supporter. We were fortunate to benefit from his wisdom as a member of many important domestic and overseas committees. His pivotal role in the establishment of the Robert J. Milano Graduate School of Management and Urban Policy of New School University will be his enduring legacy. A dynamic professor and dean, he shaped the careers of a generation of loyal students by sharing his dedication to the future of our vital urban community. We convey our sincere condolences to his wife, Evelyn; his children, Alison and Edward Levy, and Daniel and Katherine Cohen; grandchildren Anna and Rosalie; and all the members of the family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair James S. Tisch, President Stephen D. Solender, Exec V.P.
