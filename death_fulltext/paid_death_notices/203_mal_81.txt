        CHERNICK -- Arthur. The Board and Staff of the New York Association for New Americans (NYANA) are deeply saddened by the loss of our esteemed Board member and great friend Arthur Chernick. Arthur Chernick was involved in Jewish civic and philanthropic life over a period of 38 years. Arthur served on the NYANA Board of Directors since 1967, he served as its President from 1980-1983 and chaired its Executive Committee from 1983-1987. His private life was as exemplary as his public service. Arthur served as captain in the Armored Force Commission Infantry in the Second World War. His decorations include the Bronze Star, the Belgium Fouragere and European Theatre Medal-5 battle stars. Arthur has served not only his country well, but the Jewish community with distinction. He will truly be missed. We express our sincere condolences to the entire Chernick family. Michael Loeb Chairman of the Board Mark Handelman, President & CEO
