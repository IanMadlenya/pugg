        BARISH--Sylvia, 89, died peacefully at home October 25, 2005. Survived by Murray, her beloved husband of 71 years, and her eternally loving children, Marilyn and Mel Manin, Joan and Al Chasen, and Carl and Rose Barish. Sylvia knew the importance of being a mother, long before motherhood was given its due. She will be remembered as a doting angel by her seven grandchildren and wondrous tales will be passed on to her ten (and counting) great grandchildren. Graveside service, Friday October 28, 2005, 11AM, at Sharon Gardens Cemetery, Valhalla, NY.
