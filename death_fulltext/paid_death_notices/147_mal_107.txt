        WEISER-Moses. The Board of Directors of Congregation Chasam Sopher express their deep sorrow over the loss of their President, Moses Weiser, who was the soul of the shul. A beloved, scholarly man who promised to devote his life to the religious needs of his people, if he survived the Holocaust, fulfilled that commitment by decades of unheralded service to the Congregation. His contribution will be memorialized when the annex to the synagogue is completed. The new building will bear his name for eternity. The entire Jewish community has lost a great man who in his own quiet manner gave so much to so many in honor of the memory of the six million who did not survive.
