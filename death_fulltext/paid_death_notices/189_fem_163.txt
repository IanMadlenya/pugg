        HOFFMAN-Ellen Wheeler. Ellen was deeply loved by her family and we miss her terribly. She enriched our lives but left us too soon. There is a hole in our hearts.
        HOFFMAN-Ellen Wheeler. We are very sad as we say goodbye to you, dear Ellen. You are gone but not forgotten. You had a twinkle in your eyes, a hearty laugh, a love of family and such a zest for life. We will never forget the wonderful weekends and summers we shared in Pound Ridge and dinner parties with your scrumptious cooking. You were quite the hostess! Ellen, your values and your greatness will live on through Matthew. Our love and heartfelt condolences to the Hoffman and Wheeler families. Carol, Michael, Brett and Jed
