        COSBY-Ennis William. The Teachers College, Columbia University, community mourns the death of Ennis William Cosby, doctoral student. With his interest in helping children who had reading and learning disabilities, he had already made a difference in many young lives. He was the kind of student who made all of us proud. His death is a personal loss to his professors and friends at Teachers College and a loss to the profession, for he was a vibrant, caring, natural teacher. Thomas W. Evans Chair, Trustees Arthur Levine President
