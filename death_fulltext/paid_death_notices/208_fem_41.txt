        WASSON -- Sonia. Beloved matriarch of the Wasson and Brooks families. Sonny was a cherished friend of dozens of Scrabble, handball, tennis and card players who migrated together from Castle Hill Beach Club to Florida. Her strength, wit and energy-and her opinions--will be missed. She is survived by her husband Albert; her children Jeffrey and Phyllis; and her grandchildren Sophie, Sam, Rachel and Mark.
