        HALPERIN--Theodore P. The Grace R. & Alan D. Marcus Foundation mourns the passing of a founding trustee. Ted was the consummate professional in every respect. He epitomized the highest principles of integrity, ethical and moral standards. We will greatly miss his wise counsel, warm friendship and dedication to the needs of others. Our deepest, heartfelt sympathy to our co-trustees, his children, Amy Halperin Wood and Jonathan J. Halperin, and to their families. Geraldine and Daniel Soba, Trustees
