        CARSWELL--Donald. Donald passed away after a life well lived on March 25, at age 75, due to leukemia. He was a wonderful husband, father and grandfather who embodied the virtues of compassion and charity. His wit and humor were legendary, and will live on in the memories of all who knew him. He was a masterful golfer who taught the game to two generations of Carswells. His career accomplishments at and beyond NBC were significant and too numerous to list, but never outshone his dedication to community service or the importance he placed on ''doing good.'' He is survived by his wife, Lois; his children, Anne, Alex and Bob; his grandchildren, Phillip Tang, Julia Tang, Tom Carswell and James Donald Carswell; and Cassie II, the latest in a line of ''practically perfect'' black standard schnauzers. He also leaves a brother, Robert. We will all miss him immeasurably. Those who knew and loved Donald may join us to celebrate his life on May 8, 2005, at 11 AM at the Palm House of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. Contributions in his memory may be made to Poly Prep Country Day School, 674 92nd St., Brooklyn NY 11228; the Brooklyn Hospital Center, 121 DeKalb Ave., Brooklyn NY11201; or the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, 1000 Washington Ave., Brooklyn NY 11225.
        CARSWELL--Donald. Brooklyn Information & Culture is deeply saddened by the passing of Donald Carswell, whose guidance as Treasurer for 15 years and leadership in the development and building of the Brooklyn Community Access Television Facility has been invaluable. We will miss him.
