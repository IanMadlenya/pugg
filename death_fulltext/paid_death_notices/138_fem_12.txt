        PERLES-Julia. Our partners, associates and staff express our deepest sorrow at the loss of our esteemed former Senior Partner, Counsel and Chair of our Matrimonial Department. Julia Perles was a remarkable individual and an outstanding leader of the Bar whose foresight, perseverance, and leadership in the field of Family Law shaped the law in many ways over several decades, most notably in securing passage of New York's Equitable Distribution Law. She was a trusted friend and colleague whose candor, determination and wisdom manifest her richest legacy to us. We will sorely miss her distinctive presence in our professional and personal lives. We express our deepest condolences to her beloved family. Phillips Nizer Benjamin Krim & Ballon LLP
