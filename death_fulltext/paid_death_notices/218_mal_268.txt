        LEVY--Philip. Age 90, on March 20, 2005. Loving husband of the late Jane Molinaro Levy. Beloved father of Paul S. Levy and his wife Karen and Dr. Linda Fagenholz and her husband Dr. Allen Fagenholz. Adored grandfather of Rebecca and Charlotte Levy and Peter, Andrew and Elizabeth Fagenholz. His life was an inspiration to those who knew him. He came of age in the Depression and made a wonderful life for himself and his family. From chopping trees in Colorado for the Civil Conservation Corps, to running a milk route for Sheffield Farms in the Bronx, to New York City Transit Officer, to New York City Fireman (rising to Inspector), to a private business career highlighted by founding and taking public a long-term healthcare company, his energy and capacity for reinventing himself was unusual. No challenge was too great for him, and he never forgot his roots. He was a man of honor who will be sorely missed by his entire family.
