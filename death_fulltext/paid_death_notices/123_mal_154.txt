        O'BRIEN-Frank, Sr. Colleagues and friends at the NYU School of Medicine mourn the loss of Frank O' Brien, Sr., father of our highly respected clinician and teacher, Dr. Francis O'Brien. Mr. O'Brien was a distinguished maritime lawyer who endowed his four sons with a legacy of professional accomplishment and strong family values. Francis, Jr., our colleague in the Cardiology Section, Department of Medicine, has earned the respect of his peers, the deep appreciation of his patients and the warm regard of his students. A caring and thoughtful physician, he embodies the noble attributes of his late father. Throughout the generations, children have sought to model their lives on the accomplishments of their parents. Our colleague, Dr. Francis O'Brien has been true to his heritage. We extend our heartfelt sympathy and condolences to Mrs. Ellin O'Brien, her sons and the O'Brien family. Arthur C. Fox, M.D. Chief, Cardiology Section Richard I. Levin, M.D. Department of Medicine NYU Medical Center and School of Medicine
