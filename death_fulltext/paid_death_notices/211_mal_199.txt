        WEISS--Henry, 94, died August 16 after a long illness. Beloved husband of the late Sadie, loving partner of Marion, loving friend of Gert. Devoted father of Richard, Susan and Martha. Proud grandfather of Laura, Matthew and Katherine Weiss; Jennifer and Joshua Katz; Alexander and Nicholas Weiss-Richmond; and eight and a half great-grandchildren. Henry attended Cornell University and received his law degree from Columbia University. During World War II he voluntarily joined the Navy and served in the Pacific. He cofounded the firm of Cohen, Weiss and Simon and became the trusted advisor to the Airline Pilots Association and other unions. Although cherished for his humor and deep concern for others, he will be most remembered for his integrity and wisdom. Memorial service Sunday, August 29, 10:30, Congregation Emanu-El of Westchester. Donations to ACLU or the American Cancer Society.
        WEISS--Henry. Henry was an extraordinary man--a superb lawyer; a thinker, writer and talker of depth and wit and subtlety; a loving husband and partner (in turn) of wonderful women; a devoted father and grandfather; a talented leaded-glass artist; a mediocre cellist; a-late-tothe-art playwright; a crafty day sailor (harking back to his U.S. Navy WWII Executive Officer stint); a friend, partner and counselor of consummate grace and wisdom. All of us here at Cohen, Weiss and Simon LLP will miss Henry, our founding partner and guiding spirit (who doubtless would find this notice woefully lacking in some respect, and send us back to redraft). A memorial service will be held on Sunday, August 29th, 10:30AM at Temple Emanu-El, 2125 Westchester Avenue East, Rye, N.Y.
