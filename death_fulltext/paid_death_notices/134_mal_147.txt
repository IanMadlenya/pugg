        KASIN-Edwin, M.D. The Institute for Contemporary Psychotherapy notes with great sadness the passing of one of our dearest and most treasured teachers. Although he has enriched our students with his knowledge and wisdom for the past twenty-five years, it is for his humanity and gentleness of spirit that he will be most deeply remembered. Our sympathy goes out to his loving family. He will be greatly missed by all.
