        RECANATI-Yaacov. The Boys Town Jerusalem family mourns with profound sorrow the passing of Yaacov Recanati, beloved brother of our generous benefactor, Mr. Raphael Recanati who, together with his wife Dina, established a major perpetual scholarship endowment in loving memory of his father, z''l. Mr. Raphael Recanati's philanthropic benevolence has benefited disadvantaged Israeli youth at Boys Town for four decades, providing them with an outstanding academic, technological and religious education. His tzedakah helps Boys Town fulfill its mission of turning young boys from limited backgrounds into young men with limitless futures. The individual and collective achievements of Boys Town's students will endure as a lasting tribute to the memory of Mr. Yaacov Recanati. We extend heartfelt condolences to the entire Recanati family and pray that they will be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Josh S. Weston, Chairman Alexander S. Linchner, Vice Chair Rabbi Moshe Linchner, Dean Rabbi Ronald L. Gray, Exec. V.P.
