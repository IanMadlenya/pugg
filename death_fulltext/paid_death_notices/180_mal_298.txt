        SPELLMAN-Dr. Jerome. Beloved son of the late Minnie and David and brother of the late Robert, passed away on January 14, 2002. He will be missed by all of those he showed such care for. He lived by the motto, ''The day is short. The work is hard. Ours is not to complete the task, yet neither are we free to neglect it.''
