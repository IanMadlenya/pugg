Beloved husband of 64 years of Bunny (deceased), cherished father of Carol (Stephen) and Barry (deceased), honored fatherin-law of Marjorie, proud grandfather of Deborah, Jonathan, Aliza, Avi, and Dani. A resident of Woodmere, NY, for more than 50 years, Joe was a strong advocate and generous supporter of Jewish education and values. He was a past President and Chairman of the Board of Congregation Sons of Israel of Woodmere, trustee of the Brandeis School of Lawrence, a founder of the Woodmere Educational Fund, and a trustee of Boys Town of Jerusalem.

A quiet man of great dignity, Joe's inner strength set an extraordinary example for all who knew him.
