        DAVIS-Julia. On behalf of the members of 1199SEIU, New York's Health & Human Service Union, AFL-CIO, we mourn the death on June 15 in Lake Worth, Florida, of Julia Davis. Julia, was 94, was the widow of our Union's founder, Leon Davis, who retired as President in 1982 and died in 1992. She worked for many years in New York City's Welfare Department and actively pursued lifelong interest in art and social justice. She was a founder of the Workers' Children's Camp (Wo-Chi-Ca) in Hackettstown, New Jersey in the 1930's and taught art in retirement. Many 1199ers knew her as a constant companion and supporter of her husband's passionate work for justice for health care workers. She was at his side throughout his 50 year 1199 career and lived to see the tiny union he created come to represent 210,000 health care employees. She is survived by her daughter Jo; her son-in-law George Ubogy; her ''son'' David Brown; her grandchildren David and Seth Ubogy and Elia and Anthony Brown-Davis; and her great-grandchildren Alec and Nicolas Ubogy. The family thanks former 1199 Secretary-Treasurer Bill Taylor for his care of Julia Davis in recent years. In sympathy, Dennis Rivera, President, 1199SEIU George Gresham, SecretaryTreasurer, 1199SEIU
