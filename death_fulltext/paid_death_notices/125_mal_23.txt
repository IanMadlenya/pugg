        LEHMANN-Dr. Manfred R., a distinguished scholar, esteemed author who wrote brilliantly and contributed greatly to Jewish education and history past and present. A true champion of the cause of the State of Israel. We lost a multifaceted and most fascinating personality. My heartfelt condolences to his beloved wife, Sara Ann and the entire family. Moshe A.
