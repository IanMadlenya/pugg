        NELKIN--Dorothy, 69, The New York University Faculty of Arts and Science mourns the passing of our beloved colleague, Dorothy Nelkin, University Professor and Professor of Sociology and Law. Nelkin was a groundbreaking researcher who examined the interplay among science, technology and society, and she was the author of numerous important books. A member of our faculty since 1988, she was a brilliant scholar and teacher and one of the most admired and respected faculty members at NYU. She will be greatly missed. Our deepest sympathies go to her husband of 50 years, Mark Nelkin, her daughter Lisa Nelkin and granddaughter Erica Peckens. Richard Foley, Dean, NYU Faculty of Arts and Science >>AD#
