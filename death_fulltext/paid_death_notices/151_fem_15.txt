        POPKIN-Judith Elwyn. 45, of Canterbury, NH. Died Saturday, July 31, 1999, of breast cancer. She was the daughter of George and Sally Popkin of Freeport, NY. Judy Popkin was a healthcare worker and longtime activist for reproductive rights, breast cancer advocacy and women's health awareness.

In addition to her parents, she is survived by her daughter, Rachel Eades, and her family of friends: Juliana Eades, Jordy Cornog, BJ Entwisle, Julie, Dewdney and Christopher Cornog, all of Canterbury. Judy is also survived by her sister Annie Popkin and her brother, David Popkin and his family. She was predeceased by her younger sister, Susan Popkin.
