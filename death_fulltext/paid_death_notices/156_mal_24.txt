        RACHLIN-Carl. Age 82, January 1, 2000. The New York City Correction Officers' Benevolent Association deeply mourns the passing of Carl Rachlin, an energetic and passionate advocate of the cause of the correction officers of New York City, and longtime advisor and guide to COBA President Norman Seabrook, and to the other members of the Executive Board. He gave caringly and unselfishly to the important work in which he was involved. Our deep condolences to his beloved wife, Helen, and his entire family. We will sorely miss him. Norman Seabrook, President New York City Correction Officers' Benevolent Association
