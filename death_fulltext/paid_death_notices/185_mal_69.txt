        GOTTLIEB-Paul. Paul Gottlieb began his involvement at The Museum of Modern Art more than 30 years ago, initially as an advisor to its publishing activities. He became an integral part of the MoMA family when in 1975 he joined the Museum's Board of Trustees where he served actively until now. For many years, he was Chairman of both the Trustee Committees on Publications and Membership, and a longtime member of the Finance Committee. In recent years, he was an active member of the Museum's Committee on Archives, Library and Research and its Marketing and Membership Committee. Paul had an especially close relationship with his fellow trustees and the staff of the Museum who will miss his stimulating presence and the pleasure of his good company. We send our most heartfelt sympathy to his wife Elisabeth Scharlatt, his mother Liza, his sister Gail, and his children Andrew and Nicholas and their families, and his stepson Nicholas Scharlatt.
