        LEACH-David G. The Board of Directors and staff of the Garden Conservancy acknowledge with sadness the passing of Dr. David G. Leach. A world-renowned horticulturist and plant breeder, Dr. Leach was a founding member of the Garden Conservancy board and a valued leader and supporter. His national and international stature added distinction and lustre to the Garden Conservancy and its board. We extend our deepest sympathies to his family. Francis H. Cabot, Chairman Thomas N. Armstrong III, Pres. Donald J. Bruckmann, Board of Directors
