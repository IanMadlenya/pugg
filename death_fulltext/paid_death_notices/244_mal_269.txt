        DEMMERLE--Peter K., on May 24, 2007. The partners, counsel, associates and administrative staff of LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae deeply mourn the passing of our esteemed partner, colleague and dear friend, Peter, after his courageous and inspirational 8-year battle with ALS. Peter was a leader in the firm's insurance practice, particularly in the 1990s when he was instrumental in preserving the trading position in the United States of the Lloyd's insurance market. Heartfelt condolences are extended to his wife, Kate, and his four daughters, Cara, Alice, Tessa and Nina. Funeral mass on Wednesday, May 30th at 10:30 a.m., St. Michael's Catholic Church, 469 North Street, Greenwich, CT. In lieu of flowers, the family has asked that donations be made in Peter's memory to charities that support ALS research.
