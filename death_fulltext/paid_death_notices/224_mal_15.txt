        WANNISKI--Jude. Jude's passionate respect for the wisdom of the marketplace, whether financial or political, his brillance and cogency in explaining and interpreting the markets' meaning, and his unfailing insistence on understanding the view through the eyes of the underdog, the unpopular, and even the hated, informed us for over 25 years. We will miss him sorely and extend our love and sad condolences to Patricia and his children. Richard Gilder, David Howe, and the Partners and employees of Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co.
