        AMORY-Cleveland in his 81st year. The officers, directors, staff and volunteers the world over mourn the sudden death of our founder, President, and guiding intellect and spirit. Mr. Amory founded the Fund for Animals in 1967 and has led it every inch of the way while tirelessly continuing his career as a best-selling author. We will of course continue to serve animals, large and small, all of whom he loved, but without him it won't be the same. We will not see his like again. Memorial service to be announced. The Fund for Animals
        AMORY-Cleveland. The staff of Parade Publications, where he was a senior contributing editor to PARADE Magazine for more than 15 years, mourns the sudden death of our beloved friend and colleague. Cleveland's journalistic talents were as legendary as his love for animals. Although he claimed to be a curmudgeon, Cleveland was a deeply sensitive and caring man, who charmed everyone he met. His gracious style, wit and compassion will be sorely missed by all who knew him.
