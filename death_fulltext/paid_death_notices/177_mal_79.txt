        SEIFTER-Eli, Ph.D. The Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University notes with profound sorrow the death of Eli Seifter, Professor Emeritus of Surgery and of Biochemistry, and a distinguished member of Einstein's faculty for nearly four decades. Dr. Seifter was a creative and prolific scientist and a widely admired and generous teacher who brought to his teaching an unusual breadth of scholarship and experience, ranging from plant and insect physiology to clinical and pharmacological aspects of biochemistry. We extend our deepest condolences to his brother, our beloved faculty member Sam Seifter, Ph.D., Distinguished University Professor Emeritus of Biochemistry, and to the entire Seifter family. Dominick P. Purpura, M.D. The Marilyn and Stanley M. Katz Dean Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva Unversity
