        SONDHEIMER--Joseph. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) mourn the loss of Joseph Sondheimer of Glencoe, IL. A devoted supporter of the ATS, the Technion and Israel, he established the Samuel and Lillian Sondheimer Chair in International Economics and Finance. Mr. Sondheimer, a former senior partner with investment counselors Stein, Roe & Farnham, was awarded the ATS Chicago Chapter's Visionary Award in recognition of his outstanding support and tireless efforts. We extend our condolences to his wife Ida; sons David, Richard and Dr. Stuart; his grandchildren; and the entire Sondheimer family.
