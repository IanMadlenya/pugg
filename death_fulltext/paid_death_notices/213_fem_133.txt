        LOPEZ--Dorothy C. Died October 1, 2004, after a brief illness. She was a dedicated and well-respected advocate for children with special needs in the City of New York; first as a classroom teacher, then in a succession of administrative roles for the NYC Board of Education. Lopez taught future teachers and administrators at CUNY, St. John's University, LIU, and Pace. She is survived by two children, three grandchildren, a sister, a niece and nephews. In lieu of flowers, her family would appreciate contributions in her memory to one of the three charities which represent the abiding interests of her life: The Wildlife Conservation Society, The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
