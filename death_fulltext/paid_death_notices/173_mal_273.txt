        HERTZ-Abe. It is with great sadness that we extend our condolences to Eileen Grunther, wife of our esteemed colleague, Howard Grunther, her sister and brother-in-law, Karen and David Freedberg, and their children and grandchildren on the loss of their beloved father, grandfather and great grandfather. Abe Hertz was a special man. He was erudite, kind and generous. He was always thoughtful of the needs of others. We feel enriched that he graced our lives. Doctors and Staff Daniel Maklansky, M.D. Jerold D. Kurzban, M.D. Burton A. Cohen, M.D. Jerald Zimmer, M.D. Alain D. Hyman, M.D. Barry D. Berson
