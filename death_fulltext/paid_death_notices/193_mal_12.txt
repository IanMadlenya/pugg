        COBURN-Louis. 87, of Coconut Creek, FL, formerly of Queens, NY. Beloved husband of Selma, and father of Barry, of Rockville, MD, and Dr. Michael, of Houston, TX. His treasured grandchildren are Jacob, Raphael, Jeffrey and Laura, and his devoted daughters-in-law are Debbie and Dr. Amy. Survived by his brothers Perry and Henry, and by many nieces and nephews. Retired from the City University of New York at Queens College as a Professor of Library Science. He earned his doctorate at N.Y.U. His loving interest in his family, his unending thirst for knowledge of world affairs, enhanced by his daily reading of the New York Times, and his remarkable appreciation for and eager discussions about every aspect of the world around him, will be greatly missed by all who had the good fortune to know him.
