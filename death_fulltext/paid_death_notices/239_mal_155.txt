        ROSENBLUM--Robert. The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art mourn the passing of Robert Rosenblum. A brilliant art historian and critic with an extraordinarily wide range of interests, Bob brought wisdom and wit to the deliberations of the Painting and Sculpture Committee, of which he was a member from 1973 to 1996. We extend our sympathy to his wife Jane and their children Sophie and Theodore. David Rockefeller, Honorary Chairman Ronald S. Lauder, Chairman Emeritus Agnes Gund, President Emerita Robert B.
