        ENGLAND-Marshall. We have lost a dear friend and ally in the struggle for affordable, quality health care to those who have long been denied such access. Marshall's steadfast advocacy on behalf of the disenfranchised was unparalleled. We will miss him. Our thoughts and love are with his colleague and partner in the struggle, Judy Wessler, and his family and friends. Viewing Tuesday January 25th, 4 PM to 8PM, Griffin-Peters Funeral Home 2284 7th Ave. Services Riverside Church, Wednesday, January 26th, 10AM. Julio Bellber and Barbra Minch
