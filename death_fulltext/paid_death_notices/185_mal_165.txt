        GRAB-Frederic D. The Bard College community deeply mourns the passing of Frederick Grab, a longtime faculty member and dear friend. He was a man of uncompromising integrity and deep intellectual and political commitment, and was among the most discerning and exacting of teachers. His sophistication and wit contributed an aspect of excellence and originality to the college throughout his more than three decades on the Bard faculty. He will be sorely missed. We extend our deepest condolences to his two daughters, Daphne and Samantha; his former wife, the Rev. Virginia Grab; and a sister, Elizabeth Hansen of Culpeper, VA. Leon Botstein, President David E.
