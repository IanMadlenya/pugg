        KRIEGER-Jerry H. On May 16, 2000, following a courageous fifteen-year unrelenting struggle against a devastating illness. Beloved husband of Arlene and father of Aaron; cherished son of Blanche and Samuel; adored brother of Charlotte and Eve, and admired by their husbands, George and Eric. He did not allow his disabilities to lessen his ready smile, his caring for the welfare and happiness of others, his sense of humor and keen wit, or his accomplishments. He will be deeply missed by his family and friends. Service today, 11AM, at Temple Shaaray Tefila, 250 E 79 St., NYC.
