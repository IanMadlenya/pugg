        $(6$)SAINER--Janet. The Board and staff of the Community Service Society of New York mourn the loss of a friend and innovator. Her pioneering work in engaging older adults in service to their communities led to the creation of the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program, now a national program with over 7,500 volunteers in New York City alone. Her leadership in policy, practice, and service for New York City remains an inspiration. Our deepest sympathy goes to her family. David R. Jones, Pres. & CEO Community Service Society
