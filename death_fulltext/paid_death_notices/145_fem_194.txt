        BELDOCH-Honey. We will miss our grandmother and greatgrandmother for a long time to come. Chris, Jackie, Kyle and Danielle Beldoch; Eric, Tracy, Nicky and Rachel Beldoch; David and Amanda Beldoch Hoover and Katherine and Emily; Ariana Farr Beldoch and Albert Isaac (Zac) Beldoch. She took each of us as we were, loved us for who we were, and always wanted the best for us and from us. Rest peacefully, Honey.
        BELDOCH-Honey. Died peacefully in her ninety-sixth year. My best friend and mother-in-law for fiftysix years. The matriarch of the Hochfelder family. We will all miss this elegant, wise, strong, courageous, gracious lady. She will be especially missed by her loving and respectful son-in-law. Gene
