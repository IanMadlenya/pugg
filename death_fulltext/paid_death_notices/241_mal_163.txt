        BURRIS--Conrad Timothy. Brother Conrad Timothy Burris, F.S.C. The Board of Trustees and the entire Manhattan College community mourns the passing of Brother Conrad Timothy Burris, F.S.C., former dean of the College's school of engineering and founder of the chemical engineering department. The Edmonton, Alberta native, who joined the Brothers of the Christian Schools in 1950, was 82. Brother Burris served Manhattan College for four decades. A distinguished scholar, he established the department of chemical engineering on both the undergraduate and graduate levels, serving as professor, department chairperson and eventually dean of the school of engineering. Under his direction, the school of engineering developed the Particulate Solid Research, Inc. and engaged the support and sponsorship of leading corporate engineering firms from across the country. This resulted in the funding of numerous public and private sector grants and gifts. In 2002, alumni/ alumnae and friends of the Manhattan College chemical engineering department established the Brother Conrad Timothy Burris Endowment, a chemical engineering tuition and research scholarship. Visitation will be on Wednesday, February 14 from 2:00 to 5:00 pm at the Christian Brothers Center, 4415 Post Road, Bronx, NY. The funeral mass will take place at 8:00 pm on Wednesday, also at the Christian Brothers Center. Burial will be on Thursday, February 15 at Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Valhalla, NY. In lieu of flowers, contributions can be made to the Brother Conrad Timothy Burris Endowment in care of Manhattan College. Please contact Stephen Laruccia at 718-862-7582. Br. Thomas J. Scanlan, F.S.C., President and Members, Board of Trustees
