        CHARLTON--Fred. We were saddened to read of the passing of Fred. He was my teacher at CCNY, Baruch Division, my customer at Millmar Paper and my friend. His smile was his signature, he was always the encourager. Our lunches at the Gramercy Park Hotel were always positive thoughts, he would say ''Edith and I will help you all we can in business.'' An apt description of this man is he was a mensch. Now he makes the journey we all must make at one time or another. Our father in heaven blessed him with life and blessed Edith, his beloved wife, his children and grandchildren with his presence, love and inspiration. Now we cannot see him or touch him, but we will remember him always. Both my wife and I send our sincerest condolences to Edith and his family. Marlene and Milton Feldman, Naples, FL
