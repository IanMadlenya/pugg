        VINCENT--Steven. We are deeply shocked and saddened by the loss in Iraq of our friend and colleague. Steven was a passionate and intelligent reporter, in art and then in Basra. We will miss his reporting, his curiosity, humor, style, and passion for life. Our deepest sympathies to Lisa, his entire family, and his many colleagues. Sara Fitzmaurice, FITZ & CO
