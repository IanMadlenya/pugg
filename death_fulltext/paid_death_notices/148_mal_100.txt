        BARZIN-Leon. Peter Martins, Ballet Master in Chief, Howard Solomon, Chairman of the Board, Robert I. Lipp, President of the Board of Directors and the entire New York City Ballet deeply mourn the passing of Maestro Leon Barzin, one of the 20th Century's leading conductors and musical innovators, and a seminal figure in the lore and history of New York City Ballet, in combination with Lincoln Kirstein and George Balanchine, Leon Barzin was the original musical director of Ballet Society and New York City Ballet from 1948 to 1958. During that 10year span, as we sought to find our niche, both artistically and administratively as a fledgling company in the then rarified American dancescape, Barzin created an unparalleled orchestral foundation and set a musical standard, which, proudly 50 years thenceforth, remains firmly intact. His pivotal role in our creation and the legacy he has left us will never be forgotten. We express our heartfelt sympathies to his family.
