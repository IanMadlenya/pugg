        ZEREGA-Al. Beach Point Club acknowledges with sorrow the passing of Al Zerega, an employee of more than 50 years. Al was a friend to generations of club members who will miss his familiar face and wonderful stories of their own, and the club's early history. He will long be remembered as an integral part of the Beach Point family. Beach Point Club Paul N. Gardner, President
