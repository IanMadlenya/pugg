        YANOWITCH -- Murray (Mike). The M.E. Sharpe publishing family mourns the loss of our longtime colleague and dear friend Mike Yanowitch, economist, editor, and author, who died on March 2, 2005, in New York. Born in Harbin, Manchuria, in 1923, he emigrated to the United States with his family in the early 1930s. After service as a radio gunner in World War II, he earned a doctorate at Columbia University, where he studied under Abram Bergson, and served as professor of economics at Hofstra University until his retirement. Mike's long association with M.E. Sharpe began in 1960, as an editor of translation journals and later as editor of Challenge: The Magazine of Economic Affairs. His most recent book (with Bertram Silverman) was New Rich, New Poor, New Russia: Winners and Losers on the Russian Road to Capitalism. All who had the opportunity to work with Mike, both here and in Russia, will remember him as a wise and generous man, devoted to the true and just, but never unkind or without humor. We extend our condolences to his wife Rose, his son Phillip, and daughters Nina and Lee.
