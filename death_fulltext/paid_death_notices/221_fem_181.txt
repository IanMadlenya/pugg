        ARON--Jackie. The national Tourette Syndrome Association Board of Directors, its staff and all its members mourn the passing of our dear friend and true champion of all people with TS, Jacqueline Aron. Diagnosed late in life with TS, Jackie embraced the cause with abiding support for TS research through the J. Aron Foundation, of which she served as a director. Personally she underwrote awareness and educational programs for both people with TS and the public at large. She launched a unique internet program for youngsters and adults with TS through Sunrise Support, Inc. This remarkable network grew exponentially and was her pride and joy, providing critical and individual help to those touched by the severest symptoms of this neurological disorder. Our sincerest condolences are extended to her loving son Sean Patrick Aron of Los Angeles, CA., her brothers, Peter A. Aron of New York and Robert Aron of Charlottesville, VA. and to her dear friend Nicole ''Niki'' Hardin of Woodbridge, VA.
