        LONG-Harry. Born April 15, 1912, died January 24, 2001. Beloved husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather, passed yesterday after a valiant struggle with heart disease and its attendant difficulties. Harry leaves behind a legacy of commitment, wisdom and knowledge, business acumen and, most of all, love for his wife Irma, children Bob and Madeleine, grandchidren Amy and Terri, and great-grandchild Rebecca. Harry was born close to the Depression and struggled through it to found Long's Bedding in 1936, now in its seventh decade. With his wonderful wife he worked all his life to ensure that his children were enabled to succeed in whatever they choose to do. He leaves all of us richer and wiser and more able to face a future of challenge and unpredictability. Funeral today 12:00 noon, Riverside Nassau North Chapels, 55 North Station Plaza, Great Neck, NY.
