        GREENSTEIN-Mark. With heartfelt sadness, the officers, trustees and staff of the Reform Pension Board mourn the loss of our friend and former Board member, Mark Greenstein. Mark was a dedicated member of the RPB Board and a consummate professional in every Board capacity in which he served. His sincerity, humor and clear thinking enhanced every aspect of our work. We will miss him greatly and extend our sympathy to his wife Jill and family. Ronald M. Cohen, Chairman Rabbi Joseph Goldman, Vice Chairman Robert M. Koppel, Executive Director
