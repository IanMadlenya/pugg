        $(6$)LEVY--Norman F. My undying gratitude to Jeanne and Frank Levy for accepting me into their families and their father's life all these years. Living and dying, N.F.L. set the bar high. Quoting only one of our Norman's expletives, ''Everything is going to work out!'' And it did. Norman closed his last deal in life, with courage, dignity and style. Thank you for your love.
