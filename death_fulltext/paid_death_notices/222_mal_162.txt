        DENNIS--Clarence, M.D. The SUNY Downstate Medical Center community mourns the passing of Clarence Dennis, M.D., master surgeon, chair of surgery from 1951 to 1972, originator of the heartlung machine, and generous benefactor. A graduate of Harvard College in 1931, and Johns Hopkins Medical School in 1935, he received a Master's and Ph.D. in physiology from The University of Minnesota. He trained in surgery there under Owen Wangensteen, and stayed in Minnesota on the faculty prior to coming to Downstate. An original ''translational scientist,'' Dr. Dennis established himself as a leader in cardiopulmonary bypass physiology. As our chairman, he performed the first successful open-heart surgery in New York State, using an apparatus he built in our laboratories. A gifted educator, he trained scores of surgeons in New York, affecting the lives of countless people around the world. His residents established The Clarence Dennis Society in his honor, which is still active. Upon his retirement, Downstate awarded him its highest honor, an honorary doctorate in science. With his wife, Mary, he made a generous gift to SUNY Downstate, establishing one of the few endowed academic chairs in honor of great surgical educators. Upon leaving Downstate, he established a presence in our sister organization, SUNY Stony Brook, prior to returning to Minnesota for retirement. Our heartfelt sympathies are extended to Mary, to their children, Jane, Richard, James Wigertz, and David, to his fifteen grandchildren, five great grandchildren, and to all their colleagues and many friends. Michael E. Zenilman, M.D., Chairman, Department of Surgery John C. LaRosa, M.D., President Eugene B. Feigelson, M.D., Dean, College of Medicine
