        AUG--Charles. It was Charlie who gave me the opportunity to begin a second career. It was his encouragement that gave me the confidence to start again. Whatever success I may realize, it began with Charlie--and I will be forever grateful. To Jimmy, Louise, and all those he loved, I am truly sorry for your loss. May the power of his personality give you the strength to smile when you think of him. Charlie was that kind of man. Joanne Podell $(6$)AUG--Charles. A true visionary, generous mentor and trusted friend, Charlie Aug will be greatly missed. My deepest sympathy and condolences to Charlie's family and friends. Robert K. Futterman Chairman and CEO Robert K. Futterman & Associates
