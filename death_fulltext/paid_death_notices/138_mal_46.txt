        TANZER-Leon M. The officers and employees of Prima Foods Company mourn with great sorrow the passing of the founder and past president of Prima Foods Company. Leon successfully managed the company with the greatest integrity. After retiring in 1988, he remained a friend upon whom his successors could depend for wise and skillful advice. We shall miss him greatly and extend our heartfelt sympathy to his family. Steen Elgaard, Karsten Bruun and Irma Dener
