        ZWICK-Baruch, 79. Benno, beloved brother, brother-inlaw, uncle and great-uncle died in Kfar Saba on January 11, 2003. Benno was a warm, funny and loving man who came to Israel on Youth Aliyah, a founding member of the Golani Brigade who served his country as a soldier and as an ambulance driver. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Shoshana, his sons Udi & Yoram, and their families. The Picker Family.
