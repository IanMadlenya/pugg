        SCHLEICHER--Rowell A.v.M. (''Tony''). He died peacefully at home on February 26, 2005 at 76. A very special human being. Thoughtful, kind, sweet natured, always ready with a quick smile or incisive comment. A US Air Force pilot, a sculptor, a man of letters, he devoted most of his life to being an accomplished playwright for the theatre.
