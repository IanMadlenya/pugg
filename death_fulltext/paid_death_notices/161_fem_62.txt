        DEAN-Jacque. Passed over on June 6, 2000. An extraordinary presence in this life, she will be missed by her many friends and by the countless animals she helped in one way or another. A glorious voice has fallen silent but a free spirit is finally free. Blessed be. Her loving husband, Irven Rinard.
