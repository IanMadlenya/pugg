        WEISSBERG--Herbert R. We will miss Herb, our dear friend for more than 40 years. A leader in the hotel industry, he established a chain of hotels across the western hemisphere. Herb will be most remembered as a caring employer, and a loving and devoted husband, father and grandfather. Herb and Ruth were one...each the most important person in the world to the other. Our sincere sympathy to Ruth, Herb's sons and the entire family. Herrick, Feinstein LLP >>AD#
