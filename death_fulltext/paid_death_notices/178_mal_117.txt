        SUROVY-Walter. The Officers, Board of Directors and staff of the Metropolitan Opera Guild mourn the passing of Walter Surovy, the husband of our beloved longtime Board member, Rise Stevens. Walter was a great friend of the Guild and a valuable supporter of our work, and we will miss his warm and subtle humor at Guild events. Our deepest condolences go to his wife, Rise, and their family. Thomas J. Hubbard, Chairman of the Board Susan S. Braddock, President Rudolph S. Rauch, Managing Director
