        LEVINSON--Marvin, on May 20. Beloved husband of Gwen; devoted father of Brad and Randy; cherished grandfather of Celanie, Drew and Zane; loving father-in-law to Laurel and Edison; caring brother to Bruce; adored godfather to Lauren; dearest friend to countless admirers. His generosity, selflessness and dependability knew no bounds. He loved easily and made others feel equally loved. Marvelous Marv, our grief is endless as is our thanks for sharing your life with us.
