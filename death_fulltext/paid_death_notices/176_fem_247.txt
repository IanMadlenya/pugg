        GOLDSTEIN-Michelle Herman. ''Fragrant Memory.'' How quickly flowers bloom and die before they get their chance to wollow in the sun and wind and glitter in their dance. Their fragrance shared for time so short though lingering in our minds. Their beauty creating memories of so many a vibrant kind. Michelle, a flower, bloomed for us. She danced the dance of life. She loved, she cared, she brought us joy. To all she brought her light. A more vibrant person few could know, but like flowers she died to soon. A fragrance now within our memories from out of the tower's ruins. So when next you see a flower and enjoy its fragrant bloom remember Michelle Herman Goldstein, our flower who died too soon.
