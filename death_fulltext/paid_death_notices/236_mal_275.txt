        FOSTER--Ronald M. Jr. Longtime resident of New York City died at the age of 80 on September 26, 2006, in Da Nang, Vietnam, while doing what he loved the most, traveling the world. He is survived by his loving wife, Marcia Worthing, his five children, Alison (David), Thomas (Denise), Alexander, Christopher and Geoffrey, his eight grandchildren, Justin, Zachary, William, Max, Jacob, Kelly, Alexander Jr. and John, as well as his three brothers Hugh (Rune), Theodore and Alan (Sue). Graduated from Harvard, Class of 1947, and on the editorial board of the Harvard Crimson, Ronald spent most of his career as a consultant for employee benefits and also authored a book on the subject. After retiring, Ronald served as the president of the board of trustees for the Calhoun School in Manhattan. An original season ticket holder for the Jets, a lifetime Mets fan, an avid theatergoer, a lover of the ballet and the arts, Ron was a true New Yorker. When he was 75, he returned to school and earned his Master's in American Studies from Columbia University in 2004, the oldest graduating member of his class. He will be remembered for his wit, enthusiasm, warmth, curiosity, optimism and untiring love of life. The esteemed patriarch, he cherished his family above all else, and he will be greatly missed.
