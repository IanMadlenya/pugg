Board and writing a Hebrew column for the Nat'l magazine, to United Jewish Appeal where she served as co-chair of Greater New York Women's Division and on the Speakers Bureau, to the founding and support of Jewish Education with her husband: Shenkar Textile College in Israel, the Lilian & Ben Marcus pre-school in Jerusalem and the David Posnack School in Florida. She served on the New York Board of Jewish Education, the America-Israel Cultural Foundation, CLAL, the Hillcrest Jewish Center. All who knew her respected her intellectual ability and generosity of self. A lady of grace, dignity and elegance who filled our lives with love and beauty. She will be missed because she is irreplaceable. May G-d bless and keep both Lilian and Ben. May their souls be bound up in the Book of Life.
