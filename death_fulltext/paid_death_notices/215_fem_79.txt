        HUNTER--Bertina Carter, in Newport News, VA at Age 92. Former activist of the arts, passed peacefully and quietly on November 23, 2004, at the Governors Inn Retirement Home where she had resided for the past 3 years. Ms. Hunter was acclaimed as the first female and first black to become Commissioner of Art for the City of New York during the Beame Administration. Her appointment was surely a result of her affiliations with and contributions to the Studio Museum of Harlem, the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Harlem Cultural Council, the Access Stage Media Guild, and the National Conference of Artists. She was also the Director of the Norsam Gallery of Fine Arts. A memorial service will be held at the First Baptist Church of Guilford in Columbia, Maryland on Saturday, December 11th at 11AM.
