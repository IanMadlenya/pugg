        SILVERSTEIN - Etta. National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver, Colorado, offers deeply felt condolences to Larry A. Silverstein, National Jewish treasurer, and his family on the passing of his beloved mother and the family matriarch. We hope the Silverstein family takes solace in and celebrates the knowledge that Etta made a lasting impact on the community with her diligence, commitment and support of many charitable causes. A generous donor to National Jewish, Etta instilled a tradition of philanthropy early on in her children that continues to this day. Fostered by his cherished mother, Larry's long and continuing tenure with National Jewish and leadership in the New York Real Estate and Construction Industries Dinners on behalf of National Jewish goes back many decades. Larry is nurturing the same respect for philanthropy in his family. His son Roger and daughter-in-law Liana are members of the executive committe of the National Jewish AIR Society, a young leadership group. We at National Jewish remember Etta Silverstein as the foundation of a great family that takes pride in its civic duty and the betterment of society. Lynn M. Taussig, M.D. President and CEO
