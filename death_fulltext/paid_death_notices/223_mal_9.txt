        BELKIN--Gary. His friends, who are his family, mourn his death. Gary lost his battle with emphysema Thursday July 28. His comedy writing career spanned close to 60 years from New Yorker Cartoons to Emmy Award TV writing for Sid Caesar. He wrote for Danny Kaye, Johnny Carson, Anne Bancroft, Frank Sinatra and eight years for the Carol Burnett Show. He wrote for serveral sitcoms, ghostwrote much of the poetry attributed to Cassius Clay (AKA Mohammed Ali), and speeches for several politicians including John Lindsay. Gary wrote the award winning script for the PBS ground-breaking sex education show VD Blues. When slowed by his illness he devoted his efforts to mentoring emerging young comedians and being a generous and incomparably loyal friend to many of us. He bound us together by challenging us to be smarter, funnier, and angrier at injustice. We will miss him.
