        MARKS--Stephen H. 67. January 15, 2005, after a brief illness. Steve, large in physical stature and in heart, with a capacity for wit and humor to match, leaves a giant void in our lives. Graduate of Midwood High School, attended City College, worked in the Catskills, and graduated from New York Community College. The consummate entrepreneur, Steve built a highly successful career in cosmetics and duty free merchandise. He will be greatly missed by his family, colleagues and friends for his creativity and generosity of spirit. Besides his family, to whom he was devoted, his passionate loves were basketball and a great meal. Survived by Abbie, his devoted wife of 45 years; daughters Harley Ramirez, Mallary Marks, and Jessica Winter; sons-in-law Ted Winter and Angel Ramirez; and grandsons Elliot Ramirez, Samuel Winter, Maxwell Winter, and Robbie Ramirez who will never forget his passionate love and unlimited generosity. Burial will be private. The family may be visited at home January 17th-19th from 2-8 pm. In lieu flowers, contributions may be made to a charity of your choice.
