        RYLE-Joseph D. The Board of Managers and staff of East Side House Settlement express our deepest sorrow at the passing of our good friend and benefactor, Mr. Joseph D. Ryle. A member of the Board since 1956 and a dynamic and tireless volunteer of the Winter Antiques Show Committee from 1955 to the present. From 1959 to 1997 he served as Vice President on the Board of Managers, and from 1956 to 1966 as Chairman of the Winter Antiques Show Committee. A founder of the Winter Antiques Show, Mr. Ryle was an integral part of the heart and soul of East Side House-his professionalism, dedication and, especially, his friendship will be deeply missed. David L. Duffy, President Jack McAlinden, Chairman East Side House, Board of Mgrs. John A. Sanchez, Executive Dir. East Side House Settlement
