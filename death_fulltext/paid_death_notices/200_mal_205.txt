        CHRISTMAN -- Henry M., Ph.D. 71, of Manhattan, died on August 18, 2003. Active in both government and publishing, Dr. Christman served in the administrations of Mayor John Lindsay as Director of the City Record, under Governor Hugh Carey as a Member of the Worker's Compensation Board, as well as serving under Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. His most notable governmental achievement was the work done for the Worker's Compensation Board from 1977 to 1984. During that time, he adjudicated approximately 25,000 cases on appeal and jointly administered about $1 billion annually in insurance benefits. Among the many books he edited and wrote introductions for are ''The South as it Is 1865-1866,'' a collection of articles by John R. Dennett that first appeared in The Nation, published by Viking Press 1965, and more than several other works: ''The Public Papers of Chief Justice Earl Warren,'' Simon and Schuster, 1959, ''Walter Reuther--Selected Papers,'' The Macmillan Company, 1961, ''This is Our Strength-The Selected Papers of Golda Meir,'' The Macmillan Company, 1962; ''Walt Whitman's New York,'' The Macmillan Company, 1963, and for the New American Library, 1966, ''The American Journalism of Marx and Engels.'' Some of these titles are still available from other publishers. He continued to publish until not long before his death. For all the heft of his other works, probably his most widely read book was ''Mahout,'' an original fable that received not only international attention, but an award from an organization of Christians and Jews for its celebration of the triumph of good over evil. He is survived by his companion of 48 years, Abraham Feldman. There will be a memorial service on Friday, October 17, at the Religious Society of Friends, 15 Rutherford Place on Stuyvesant Square, Manhattan. A reception starting at 6 PM, will be followed by an informal Friends service.
