        BEHRMAN-Darryl G. The investment and administrative professionals of Behrman Capital were shocked and deeply saddened by the untimely passing of our beloved co-founder and managing partner, Darryl G. Berhman, who died unexpectedly of a heart attack at age 51 on Tuesday, February 12, 2002, while vacationing in Anguilla. He was a strong and effective leader, who will be greatly missed. We will draw on Darryl's strength and vision as we honor his legacy through the continued success of the firm that he worked so hard to build. We are committed to carrying on the firm's objectives with an undaunted will to achieve-the will heightened by the remembrance of Darryl's example. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife Janine, his son Greg, his daughter Amanda, his mother Fay, and his brother Grant, co-founder and managing partner of our firm, as well as the other members of Darryl's extended family and his many friends and colleagues. They are in our hearts and prayers.
