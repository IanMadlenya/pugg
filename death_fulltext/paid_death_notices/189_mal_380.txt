        GOLDMAN-Dr. Eliezer. The Yeshiva University family mourns the passing in Israel of one of its most illustrious Yeshiva College alumni '37. He made Aliyah in 1938, earned a Ph.D from Bar Ilan University where he taught and later was chairman of the Department of Philosophy. He was the recipient of the prestigious Bialik Prize in 1998. A man of wide erudition, he was considered one of the leading philosophers in Israel. Our heartfelt condolences to his children; Pnina Agam, Menachem and Yoel, his brother Dr. Jacob E. Goldman, honorary member of the Yeshiva University Board of Trustees, and sister Judith Crystal and grandchildren. May they all be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University Ronald P. Stanton, Chairman YU Board of Trustees
