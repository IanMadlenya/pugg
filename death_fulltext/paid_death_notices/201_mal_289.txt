        RADER--Gilbert. The Grand Lodge Knights of Pythias of NY, notes with great sorrow the passing of Supreme Representative Sir Gilbert Rader. Gilbert served with distinction as a Grand Chancellor and Supreme Representative. He held various offices in Pythian Camp and was Chairman of countless committees. Brother Rader exemplified the Pythian values of friendship, charity and benevolence. He will be greatly missed by all and leaves a void that can never be filled.
