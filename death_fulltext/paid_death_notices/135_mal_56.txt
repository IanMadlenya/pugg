He came in time to NYC where he lived for many years and worked as an Engineer. He was a member of NYC Tennis Club with a fine passion for the sport. Recently he used his intellect to create computer graphics. His final act was to donate his body to science; intention was that his disease might be conquered. He will be missed by all who knew him. Donations should be made in his memory to Sloan-Kettering Cancer Research.
