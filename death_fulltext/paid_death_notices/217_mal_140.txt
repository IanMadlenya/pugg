        TANZER--Jack. On February 7, 2005 in New York of complications from lung cancer. He was 83. For nearly 40 years, he was a dealer in American and Old Master paintings, having served as president of the Old Master Division of M. Knoedler & Co. in New York from January 1971-February 1985 where he produced many important exhibitions. Born in the Bronx, he combined his love of art and sports since childhood. He graduated from Evander Childs High School, worked as a cartoonist for Walt Disney in California, drew cartoons for the Long Island Daily Advocate, and in 1942 became the sports editor of the Northside News. He served as a cryptographer in the U.S. Army, later returning to New York. He joined Art Flynn Associates, a public relations firm, where he handled clients including the New York Giants and became the 18-year-old Willy Mays' legal guardian. Later, he did public relations for ABC-TV's ''Wednesday Night Fights.'' In 1966, he returned to his primary interest in the fine arts; in 1967 he formed a partnership with the Boston art dealer Warren Adelson. It was from that time that Jack Tanzer went on to establish an exceptional career in the art world commencing with his first important client and subsequent personal friend, Walter P. Chrysler, Jr., whose great and varied art collection later became the core of the Chrysler Museum in Norfolk, Va. Tanzer later gave his collection of Pre-Columbian art and his Warhol portrait to that institution. He is survived by his wife of 53 years, Audrey; his daughter, Tara; son, Edward; two grandchildren, three great-grandchildren, and a sister, Lilian Campo. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to New York City Division of the American Cancer Society, 19 W. 56th Street, NY, NY 10019.
