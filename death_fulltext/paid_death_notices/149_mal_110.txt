        KATZ-Joseph Howard. The board, staff and members of the Jewish Association for Services for the Aged note with profound sadness the death of our beloved mentor, friend, colleague and supporter. He was instrumental in the creation of JASA 31 years ago and remained active on the board throughout the subsequent years. He assumed key leadership roles, including Vice Chair, Chair of the Law Committee, and Co-Chair of the Nominating Committee. Almost until his last days he continued to be a guiding and inspirational force to his colleagues on the board as well as JASA staff. We will miss this caring, gentle man who devoted so much of his life to helping others. Our sincere condolences to his wife, Marion, and the others members of his family. Marilyn Friedman, President Steven M. Jacobson, Chairman David J. Stern, Executive VP
