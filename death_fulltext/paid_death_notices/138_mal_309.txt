        TILLINGHAST-Charles Carpenter, Jr. The Directors of the Henry Luce Foundation mourn the passing of their distinguished colleague and friend who served with great loyalty on the Foundation's Board from 1974-1996. He will be remembered for his wise counsel, unerring common sense and often uncommon insight. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Lisette and to all of his family. Henry Luce, III, Chairman and John W. Cook, President
