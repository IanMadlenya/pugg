The Board of Directors and Officers of the American Red Magen David for Israel (ARMDI) Southeast Region mourn the passing of Jack Kwartner, beloved humanitarian, philanthropist and life-long friend of Magen David Adom and the people of Israel. His generous contributions to his beloved State of Israel include 65 fully equipped MDA ambulances and a wing of the MDA National Blood Center in Ramat Gan, Israel. He will be sorely missed by his legion of friends and admirers in Israel and the United States. We extend our deepest sympathy to his dear wife Irene and children.
