        ZIMMERMAN-Leonard N. On January 13, 2002. Knowledgeable of world affairs, concerned for people everywhere, a teacher, a scientist, & a wonderful storyteller, he found immense joy in family, the garden, music, & conversation. He would want us to ''celebrate life,'' and to ''do the right thing.'' He will be remembered always by his wife Rima, sons Erik and Raul, daughter Leda, and his seven grandchildren.
