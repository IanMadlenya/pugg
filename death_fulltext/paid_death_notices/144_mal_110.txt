        SERLIN-Anthony. The officers and staff of SSEU Local 371 note with sadness the untimely passing of Tony Serlin, longtime Associate Director of Research and Negotiations. Tony worked for the Union for over 25 years and helped negotiate all the Union's contracts since 1972. Over the years his knowledge of detail and history made him an invaluable resource to the institution and his willingness to share his time made him a special friend to many, many members who went to him for assistance. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife Justina, also a longtime union activist, and his children Tevin, Charles, Megan, and Rebecca. Charles Ensley, President SSEU Local 371
