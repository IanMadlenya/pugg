        KAYE--Bernard, 85, died from complications of diabetes and Alzheimer's. Born in Brooklyn, the son of Bessie and Morris Kabikow, he grew up in impoverished circumstances. His entire emotional life was colored by the hardships of his childhood. His family found the challenge of raising their developmentally delayed son George more than they could cope with. When their parents passed away, he assumed responsibility for George's care. Bernard was predeceased by his four siblings. After his graduation from Brooklyn College in 1942, he served in the US Army. In 1957 he married Sivia Karansky of Boro Park, Brooklyn, and had two children, Beth Kaye and Glenn Novarr. With the encouragement of his in-laws, he became a CPA. His passions were playing tennis and trading stocks. Since June 2005, he lived in Portland, OR. He is survived by his wife and children, who will cherish his memory. Donations appreciated: JDRF and Layton Alzheimer Center, both in Portland OR.
