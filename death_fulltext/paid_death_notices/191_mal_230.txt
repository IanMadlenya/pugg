        KATZ-Michael A. Beloved husband of Margaret. Adored father of Joshua and Jonathan. Son of Phyllis and Abraham. Brother to Alex, Peter and David. A true prince among men, a gentleman, a scholar, a spirit larger than life, the magic of his being will last through eternity.
        KATZ-Michael A. 56, died December 20. Devoted husband, loving father and friend to many. He embraced life and did it his way. A kind and gentle spirit, he had a passion for good music and fine guitars and for those of us who shared these with him. A great sense of humor, he laughed a lot. You left us too soon, Michael, the music has stopped. Your lifelong friend, Dick
