        REPETTI-Peter J. The partners and associates of Fulbright & Jaworski LLP are deeply saddened by the passing of Peter J. Repetti, our esteemed former partner, colleague and friend, whose advise and counsel were often sought, willingly given and greatly appreciated. We are most thankful for the fact that his entire legal career was spent with our firm and its predecessor, Reavis & McGrath. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to his wife, Joan, and his children, Grace, Joan, Charles and Christine and his family.
