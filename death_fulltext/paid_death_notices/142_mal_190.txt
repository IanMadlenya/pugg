        HILFSTEIN-Max. We are deeply saddened by the death of dear friend, Founder and President of the New Cracow Friendship Society. Max also served as President of the Pelham Bay Jewish Center for 21 years. He was a man of great compassion and love for his fellow man. Our heartfelt sympathies to wife Erna, son Leon, daughter Simone and their families. For the last two weeks, Erna and Simone were at his bedside 24 hours a day.
