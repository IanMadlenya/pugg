        WARRELL-Christopher J. The Trustees and Staff of Bassett Healthcare, Cooperstown, NY, mourn the loss of Christopher J. Warrell, PhD, president of the Friends of Bassett, our philanthropic organization. Since moving to our community in 1989, following an inspired career as an educator in Long Island, Dr. Warrell distinguished himself as a dynamic leader and a most dedicated volunteer. He will be sorely missed. Our thoughts and prayers go to his wife, Lois and his family. William F. Streck, MD, President & CEO Thomas Q. Morris, MD, Chairman, Board of Trustees
