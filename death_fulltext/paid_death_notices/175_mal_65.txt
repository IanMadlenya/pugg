        THOMAS-Carl Wayne. With deep sorrow the Kings County District Attorney and his staff mourn the untimely passing of Carl Wayne Thomas. His unyielding energy and zest for life will be missed by all those who came in contact with him. While an Assistant District Attorney (1993 to 1995), Carl brought a heart-searching vigilance to his legal work. He knew that the law can only strive for justice and fairness and advocated that prosecutors should ''mend the social fabric of our country with a thread of justice.'' Friends and former colleagues of Carl W. Thomas send their heartfelt condolences to his wife, Mrs. Elizabeth Thomas, their children and his family. His friendship, his talent as a skilled attorney and his presence in our lives will be truly missed. May he rest in peace.
