        LEPORE-Michael J., M.D. The Medical Staff of St. Vincent's Hospital mourns with sorrow the passing of a dear friend, mentor and esteemed colleague. Dr. Lepore joined our faculty in 1966 as Chief of the Section of Gastroenterology and Director of the Upjohn GI Unit. Dr. Lepore's research and medical practice enhanced the lives of thousands of grateful patients. He authored over 65 publications and textbooks. In 1982 he wrote ''Death of the Clinician'' a book in which he examined how education overemphasizes the science of medicine to the neglect of the art of caring for the sick. A physician of great courage, wisdon and intensity, he was a fierce and vocal advocate of the private practice of medicine and the sacred patient-physician bond. We will forever cherish the memory of this champion of medicine and extend our heartfelt sympathy to his son Frederick. Joseph M. Jabbour, M.D. President of the Medical Staff St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center
