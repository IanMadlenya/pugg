        HEWLETT-William R. Faculty, students and colleagues of the City University of New York's Americas Center on Science and Society, along with members of its InterAmerican scientific team (IACERE) mourn the profound loss of William R. Hewlett, a visionary leader in industry, science and technology, and international philanthropy. Through his innovative work and generous philanthropical commitments, he made an enormous impact on American society and the entire global community. We are joined by CUNY Chancellor Matthew Goldstein, the Graduate Center's President Frances Degen Horowitz, Vice President Brian Schwartz, and its Officers in extending our deepest sympathies to his wife Rosemary, children and the rest of his entire remarkable family, and to members of the Board and staff of the Hewlett Foundation. William Hewlett was a towering person and caring friend, and his family can take pride in his countless achievements, knowing that the extraordinary mark he made on humanity will grow stronger for generations to come.
