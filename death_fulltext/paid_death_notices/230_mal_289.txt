        GERTNER--Jack. The partners of Anchin, Block & Anchin LLP mourn the loss of their esteemed partner, Jack Gertner, of Forest Hills, Queens, on Wednesday, March 22nd, 2006. Prior to his retirement in 1990 Jack spent a lifetime career at Anchin, where he faithfully served clients and acted as the firm's Chief Financial Officer.

We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his wife, Trudy, his two sons, Richard, a member of Anchin's Tax Department, and Robert, and their families. We extend our deepest sympathy to the family on the loss of our wonderful friend and mentor. The Partners of Anchin, Block & Anchin LLP
