        JEROME--Lucille. The administration, staff and faculty of Monroe College note with sadness the passing of Lucille Jerome, widow of the College's co-founder, Harry, and father of our current President, Stephen J. Jerome. Her warmth, generosity, wit, humanity and commitment to the ideals of the college touched thousands of students. She was an inspiration to all who knew her and she will be sorely missed. We extend our deepest sympathy to the Jerome family. Alex Ephrem Senior Vice President
