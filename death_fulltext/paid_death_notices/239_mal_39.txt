        TROW--George W.S. Legions of old friends will always remember the infectious humor, outrageous sense of fun, sharp powers of observation and prodigious talent of one who has left them too soon. From school days throughout a long distinguished literary career, George spread mirth through written and spoken word, lampooning the ridiculous in life, for which he had a refined appreciation, and sharing his perpetual, original insights through a highly inventive use of language. He could inspire as well as incite to laughter and was generous with the solid advise of a profound thinker and serious writer. He animated every gathering he ever attended and was respected and beloved more widely than he realized. Arrangements for an event commemorating his life will be announced at a later date. To his mother, Anne C. Trow, who survives him, deepest sympathy is extended.
