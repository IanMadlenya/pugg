        GEWIRTZ-Rabbi Jonas. The Board of Directors and staff of UJA-Federation mourn the passing of Rabbi Jonas Gewirtz, cherished father, beloved husband, and renowned scholar, who enriched the lives of others through his gentleness and wisdom. He passed on a legacy of generosity to his family, longtime supporters of UJA-Federation and many communal activities. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to his devoted wife, Lola; his daughter, Dorothy, president of Camp Mogen-Avraham, Heller, Sternberg, Inc., a UJA-Federation beneficiary, and her husband, Julius, a member of our Board of Directors; his son, William, and his wife, Debbie; his many grandchildren; and to the entire family. May you be consoled among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair James S. Tisch, President Stephen D. Solender, Exec. V.P.
