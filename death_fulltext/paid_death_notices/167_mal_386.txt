        MITCHELL-Stephen A. The faculty, graduates and candidates of the Institute for the Psychoanalytic Study of Subjectivity grieve the devastating loss of the incomparable Steve Mitchell. Those graced by his brilliance as teacher and generous colleague experienced first hand his intellectual elegance, indefatigable curiosity, personal vitality, warmth and irrepressible good humor. For all of us, he changed forever how we think about psychoanalysis. We join the psychoanalytic community in mourning the tragic loss of the leader of the relational psychoanalysis movement and extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Margaret Black and his daughters Caitlin and Samantha.
