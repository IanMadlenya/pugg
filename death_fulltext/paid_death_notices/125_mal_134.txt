        NATHANSON-Morton, M.D. The Department of Neurology of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine is saddened to note the death of Morton Nathanson, M.D. Dr. Nathanson was a Clinical Professor and a member of the Department for over 20 years, before moving to found the Department of Neurology at the Long Island Jewish Hospital. He was a man of great energy and wit. He was an exceptional teacher, a world-renowned diagnostician, and a man of erudition. He helped train a generation of neurologists. Particularly important was his ability to counter prevailing opinion when he believed he was right. We will miss his warmth and kindness. We extend our deep sympathy to his family.
