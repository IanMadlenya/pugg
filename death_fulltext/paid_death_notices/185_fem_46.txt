        BARKER-Natalya A. It is with inconceivable regret that we say good-bye to our beloved wife and mother Natalia Alexandra Smolianinova. She was & always will be the spirit of our family. Natalia was always unattainable, now she truly is. Natalia was educated in Rostov, Russia and received her B.A. in foreign languages there. After coming to the U.S. to attend a small business program for Russian students at Wharton in 1995 she returned to Russia. In 1997 after a lengthy cross continent courtship she returned to the U.S. and was married to Michael Barker whom she leaves with a three year old daughter Polina Grace Barker of Manhattan. Natalia also leaves a mother, father and younger brother of Bataisk, Russia. She was 32 years old. There will be a memorial service for Natalia, June 12th at Calvary Church, 21st Street and Park Avenue South, at 3 P.M.
