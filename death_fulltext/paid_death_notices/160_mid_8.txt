        LEIBOWITZ-Jerry. We extend heartfelt condolences to Henrietta Leibowitz on the passing of her beloved husband, Jerry. A dedicated leader in our Southeast Region, Jerry personified kindness and modesty. As a Founder of the Medical Center together with Henrietta, he made a vital difference to the health care needs of the people of Israel. May Henrietta, son, Matthew, daughter, Rita Hurwitz, a devoted and caring friend to the Hospital, and the entire family, be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Amer.
