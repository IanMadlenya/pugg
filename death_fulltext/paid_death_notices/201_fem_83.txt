        O'DONNELL--Alice Jenkins, of New York City, New York, died after a serious illness, on Thursday, October 9, 2003, at Calvary Hospital. Alice was born on October 17, 1912, in Westchester County, New York, to the late Peter and Harriet (Forbes) Jenkins. She was married to Charles S. O'Donnell, who predeceased her by many years. They had no children. Although at the time of her death Alice had no close living relatives, she was blessed with many close friends who will miss her dearly. For over 40 years, Alice worked for Ogilvy & Mather, an advertising agency in New York City, and, at 90 years of age, was a full time employee there until September of this year when she became ill. A very private person, modest and unassuming in her manner, Alice was a woman of diverse accomplishments and interests. She had a bachelor's degree from Wellesley College and a master's in psychology from Columbia University. An avid reader (especially of good mysteries), Alice was a regular visitor to the Mercantile Library. She took great pride in successfully completing the New York Times crossword puzzle every day. Alice was also an intrepid traveler and had been to many countries; she spent a lot of time in Greece and the Mediterranean. A favorite winter destination was Peter Island, where she could simply sit under a palm tree with a good book. More recently, as she became less mobile, Alice determinedly set out to see France by barge. Her final such excursion was in June. Alice generously supported many charities over her lifetime, especially The Fresh Air Fund, and devoted much of her time to helping other people. As Alice wished, there will be no reposing and no funeral service. Memorial donations may be made to the Fresh Air Fund, 633 Third Avenue, 14th Floor, New York, NY 10017 Attn. Lori Seader for Alice O'Donnell Memorial.
