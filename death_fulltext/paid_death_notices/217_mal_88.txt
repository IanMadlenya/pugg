        WERTIMER -- Sidney. 84, professor of economics for 52 years at Hamilton College, died on February 1, in Charleston, SC, while visiting members of his family. In addition to teaching finance, money and banking, and accounting to Hamilton undergraduates as the McEwen Professor of Economics, Dr. Wertimer served at various junctures of his career as economics department chairman, associate dean of the college, provost and college marshal. For half a century he was a volunteer firefighter for the Village of Clinton and kept a department radio crackling in his kitchen 24 hours a day. Born in Buffalo, New York, on October 28, 1920, Sidney Wertimer graduated in 1942 from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, then reported for active duty as an Ensign aboard the Navy destroyer William D. Porter. Following WWII, Lieutenant Wertimer returned to the University of Buffalo to obtain an M.A. degree in economics and went from there abroad to study at the London School of Economics where he earned a Ph.D. in 1952. Via transatlantic telephone, he was offered an assistant professorship at Hamilton, where he remained a conspicuous and highly energetic presence on campus for the next five decades. He is the author of ''Economics and Man,'' a college textbook used nationally. Professor Wertimer is survived by his wife of 57 years, the former Eleanor M. Walsh; four children: Peter (Alicia Mendicino), Sheila (Gary Gruca), Stephen (Jane Boster), and Thomas (Raylene Saltouse); and ten grandchildren. He is also survived by a brother Edward (Skyne Uku-Wertimer). A memorial service will be held on Thursday, February 10, at 4 pm, in the Hamilton College Chapel. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made in Professor Wertimer's name to the Town/Gown Fund, c/o Hamilton College, 198 College Hill Rd, Clinton, NY 13323.
