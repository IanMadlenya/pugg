        LASSOFF--Martin, 76, of NYC, on April 15, 2007 after a long illness. Adored husband of Michelle, cherished father of Samantha, Andrea, Lisa, Eric, and Jan, and granddad of Sadie and Sean, beloved brother of Roz and Doris, and brothers-in-law Marvin and Harry. An esteemed litigator and steadfast Yankee fan, we will deeply miss his devotion, munificent spirit and humor.
