        GOUDKET--Bert. It is with deep sadness that the Officers, Board of Directors, and neighbors of La Coquille, Westhampton Beach, mourn the passing of our past President and dear friend Bert Goudket. We will miss his common sense and wise leadership. Our love and thoughts are with his beloved wife Selma and their wonderful family.
