Helen served both the real estate industry and the community with distinction, combining care and wisdom with the highest standards of integrity. Her affection for ''Town & Country'' and its staff was unquestioned. We are grateful to have been associated with her and send our deepest sympathy to her daughter Felicia and family. Howard P.
