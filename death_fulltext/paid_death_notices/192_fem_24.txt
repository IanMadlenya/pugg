        BATES-Barbara, M.D. Died December 18, 2002 at her home in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. A native of Auburn, New York, Dr. Bates earned her BA at Smith College in 1949, then completed medical studies and residency training at Cornell University Medical College in New York City. Barbara Bates gained national and international recognition as an outstanding professor of medicine and an activist in interdisciplinary healthcare. In the late 1960's she helped conceive and develop the then new role of nurse practitioner working to improve public access to healthcare by encouraging greater collaboration between physicians and nurses. Her best known book, ''A Guide to Physical Examination and History Taking'', first published in 1974 and continuing under her direction for seven editions became and still is the leading text in its field published in eleven languages. In 1992 she published her awarding winning study, ''Bargaining for Life, a Social History of Tuberculosis, 1876-1938.'' From 1980 until she retired in 1996, Dr. Bates held faculty positions at the University of Pennsylvania Schools of Medicine and Nursing and at the Medical College of Pennsylvania and Hahnemann. A celebration of her life and reception is planned for Sunday, February 2, 2003 beginning at 4:30 PM at the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, 19 S. 22 St, Philadelphia. Donations in Barbara Bates memory may be made to the Center for the Study of the History of Nursing at the University of Pennsylvania or to the hospice of the Visiting Nurse Association of Greater Philadelphia.
