        LEWIS-John. John Lewis was a man of elegance, sophistication, impeccable taste and enormity of heart. He was a great original; a connoisseur of living. Above all, he was an honest man. This honesty enriched every beautiful note that he played or wrote. We mourn at his passing, but celebrate the largness of his spirit. This will never die. His glorious canon of music forever speaks most eloquently of our time and our civilization. We miss him; we love him. R. Theodore Ammon, Chairman Gordon J. Davis, Founding Chairman Wynton Marsalis, Artistic Director and the Jazz at Lincoln Center staff and artists
