        CONWAY--James J., Jr. The Board and staff of Little Flower Children and Family Services mourn the passing of James J. Conway, Jr. Although thousands knew him as the brilliant former leader of Long Island Savings Bank, we at Little Flower knew him not only as a generous supporter of children in crisis and disabled adults, but as a dear friend. He and his family remain in our thoughts and prayers.
