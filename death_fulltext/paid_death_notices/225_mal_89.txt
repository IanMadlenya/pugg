        DUNNE--Hugh A. Lifelong New Yorker, lost his battle with colon cancer on October 2, 2005 at the age of 62. Born June 5, 1943, Hugh grew up on the Upper West Side and as a child appeared in the television shows ''I Remember Mama'' and ''Watch Mr. Wizard'' among others. Hugh loved the city and was particularly passionate about the New York Subway system. He was hired as a consultant for the Subway's 1979 Diamond Jubilee and went on to become Special Assistant for TA Operations under John Simpson. He personally walked more than half of the system's six hundred miles of track, and his encyclopedic knowledge of the subway along with his presence at virtually every subway crisis earned him the nickname of ''Mr. Subways'' from the Daily News in 1983. After leaving the TA in 1984, Hugh joined New York biotech company ImClone Systems as Director of Security, a position he held until his death. Hugh is survived by his son and daughter-in-law, Charles and Judy Dunne of New York City; his daughter and son-in-law, Susanna and Jeffrey Berg of New Milford, CT; his three grandchildren, Sarah, Alexander and Benjamin Berg and his dear former wife, Annamarie M. Dunne. A Funeral Mass will be held at The Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel on Monday, October 10 at 5:00 PM. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations to be made to the Hugh A. Dunne fund at the Museum of the City of NY
