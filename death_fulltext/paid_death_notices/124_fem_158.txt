        DuPONT-Bette Y. (nee) Katz, on May 19, 1997. We mourn the loss of our beloved mother. Survived by her loving children, daughter Gale Axelrod and son Jeffrey Axelrod, both of Manhattan, son Reed Axelrod and adored grandson Benjamin Gilbert Axelrod, both of Philadelphia. Laid to rest in eternal peace with her parents, Bella and Max Katz at New Montefiore Cemetery. We will miss you dearly and will carry your love in our hearts always.
