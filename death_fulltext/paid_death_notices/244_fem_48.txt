        LANE--Mildred. The officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Mildred Lane, beloved mother of Clifford Lane, whose generosity on Long Island enables us to renew and enrich Jewish life in New York, in Israel, and around the globe. We extend our deepest sympathies to Mildred's children Clifford and Randi, Stewart and Bonnie, Arlene and Daniel Fisher, and to her entire family. Morris W. Offit, President Susan K. Stern, Chair of the Board John S. Ruskay, Exec. V.P. & C.E.O
