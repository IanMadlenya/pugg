        MUNSON-Larom B. The members of the Art Dealers Association of America mourn the passing of their distinguished colleague, an ADAA member since 1976. He was committed to the artists he represented and an active participant in many activities devoted to the improvement of the Sante Fe community in which his gallery was located for more than 20 years. Our deepest sympathy and condolences to his wife, Barbara, his children and his many grandchildren. Richard Gray, Pres. Gilbert S. Edelson, Admin V.P.
