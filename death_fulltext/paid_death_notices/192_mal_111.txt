        CARR-Thomas W. It is with great sadness that we mourn our dear friend and neighbor, Tom. Our families shared life's joys and sorrows for over 40 years, and we extend our heartfelt sympathy to Agnes, John and Louise, Jimmy and Robin, and Pete. We will miss his witty and stimulating discussions and remember him always with great love and affection. Doris O'Connell, Children and Grandchildren
