        ROTH-Murray. We mourn the tragic and sudden loss of our beloved friend & mentor. He was everything a friend ever could be, true, devoted and loving. He stood by his friends and helped them navigate through the ups and downs of life. His words and sage advice will never die. Nor, will the results of his many acts of kindness. We, and many, many others, will forever have him in our hearts, minds and souls. We will miss him so and love him forever. Pam, Catherine, Dawn and Philip
