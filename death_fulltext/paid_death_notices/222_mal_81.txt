        TALBOT--Paul, 86, a television industry pioneer, died on Wednesday at his family home in Brewster, MA. He was a lifelong resident of Manhattan. Along with his wife of 39 years, Susan Talbot, he is survived by his daughter, Rachel, and his three sons, Keith, John and Thomas. As President and founder of The Fremantle Corporation, he was an innovator in the international distribution of American television. Thanks to him, American shows such as ''Romper Room'', ''Biography'', ''The Galloping Gourmet'', ''Baywatch'' and ''The Price is Right'' have been seen by viewers throughout the world. Paul Talbot began his career in show business during radio's ''golden age'' in the 1930's as a performer in live soap operas including ''The Adventures of Henry Aldrich'' and ''Aunt Jenny's Real Life Stories''. He served in Europe as a First Lieutenant during World War II. In the 1950's, Mr. Talbot also worked as a writer on the ''Superman'' and ''Batman'' comic books. He was politically active, organizing media for the 1948 National Convention of the Progressive Party and later leading a successful campaign to desegregate Stuyvesant Town, a privately owned housing development in New York City.
