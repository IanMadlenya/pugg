        GOSSETT--O. Milton. Known to all as Milt. Passed away March 1. I knew him for 21 years as my boss and friend. A great man, a do gooder to hundreds and an icon in the world of advertising. He and his wonderful wife Anna welcomed me to their home and made me feel one of the family. My heartfelt sympathy goes to Anna, their children Susanne, Tom, Michael and Lori and their daughters and sons-in-law Julie, Renee, Patrick and Ralph and their beloved grandchildren. He will be greatly missed. Stella
