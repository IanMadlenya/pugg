        KEPES--Edith. Her fellow sculptors at the Art Students League note with sadness the death of our friend Edith after an accident at age 92. She worked for years among us as recently as last September. Her smile and sunny disposition will long be remembered. She was a beautiful woman who made beautiful art.
