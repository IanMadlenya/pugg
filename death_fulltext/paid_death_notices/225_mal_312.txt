        GROSS - Bernard. Bernard ''Bernie'' Gross left us peacefully in his Merrick home on October 28, 2005. Born in New York City on July 16, 1919, Bernie grew up in the Bronx with his sister Rose and parents Grace and Harry. He graduated from De Witt Clinton High School, and then from CCNY in 1941. That same year he was inducted into the Army at Fort Dix. Bernie served with distinction and honor, rising to the rank of Master Sergeant in only four years. He proudly served in the Army in the ChinaBermna-India Theater, and after the end of hostilities he was transferred to Shanghai, where he met his future wife, the late Lily Gross, who he married in 1948. Bernie and Lily had two sons, Ronald I. Gross, MD, FACS and the late Lawrence H. Gross, MD. Bernie was the President and CEO of the Grace Luggage Company, a business he proudly ran until his retirement over a decade ago. He was a Mason, and was elected to the position of Master Mason in 1954. After the death of his wife, Bernie became very close to Dr. Grace Griffenberg and her children, Susan Trovati and Stuart Griffen. At his death, Bernie's family looked to Grace as his wife because of her compassion, dedication and love for him. Bernie is survived by his son and daughter-in-law, Ron and JoAnn, his grandsons Daniel L. Gross and Michael H. Gross, his nieces Joyce Adler, Andrea Gosline, Laura Walsh, and their families. Services will be held at 11:30 AM, on Sunday, October 30, at the Plaza Funeral Home, 91st Street and Amsterdam Avenue, and burial with full military honors will be held at the Baron Hirsch Cemetery on Staten Island. In lieu of flowers, please give generously to the charity of your choice.
