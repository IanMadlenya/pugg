As Professor of Pathology and Director of Surgical Pathology, Dr. Kaneko was our beloved colleague, and the guiding spirit of the department for over 40 years, serving as an incomparable mentor to countless residents, fellows, and colleagues. His diagnostic acumen in both gross and microscopic pathology was legendary, and his contributions to medical science are immense and will survive him for many generations. We offer our most sincere condolences to his wife, Ranko. Memorial service at Frank E.
