        RACKMAN -- Honey. The partners, associates and staff of Gottlieb, Rackman & Reisman, P.C. mourn the passing of Honey Rackman, wife of founding partner Michael I. Rackman after a long battle with cancer. Honey was active in many Jewish causes that she felt passionately about, including The Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance and Agunah, Inc. She exemplified the modern Jewish woman, while keeping faith with Jewish tradition. Her home was always open to family and friends, who can attest to her warmth and thoughtfulness. Our thoughts are with her husband, our longtime colleague, and to her children and grandchildren. We share their loss. Gottlieb, Rackman & Reisman, P.C.
        RACKMAN--Honey. A beautiful woman, always in our hearts. Never forgotten. Yvette Kass Schwartz >>AD#
