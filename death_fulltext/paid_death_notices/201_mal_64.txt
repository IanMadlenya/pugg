        SLONIM--Michael L. Zeichner Ellman and Krause LLP mourns the loss, much too early in life, of its longtime counsel and friend, Michael Slonim. Michael, an intellectual lawyer's lawyer, served as a pillar of the firm. He was always a resource for difficult cases and at the same time, a mentor to many junior attorneys. His wit, humor and knowledge of music will be missed by all. We extend our deepest condolences to his dear wife, Diane, and to his beloved children Max and Alex. May his family at home draw strength from knowing that his family at work loved and appreciated him and will always continue to do so.
