        COLEMAN-Adolph. Will be deeply missed by the family and many friends who loved and cherished him for 98 years. He was the gentle in gentleman and the trunk of the great living tree of close relationships that he steadfastly embraced and encouraged. He adored Bella, his loving wife of 67 years; his children Owen and Michelle and his seven grand and great-grand children, whose kisses were his Paradise.
