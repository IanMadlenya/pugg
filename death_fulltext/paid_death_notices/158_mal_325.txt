        PAPELL-Robert. The community of West End Synagogue mourns the loss of this quiet original thinker. For years a stalwart of the Bible Study Group, his humor, his thoughtful insights and his twinklyeyed smile gave us clues to the genuine ''goodness'' and depth of this man, an assessment from which he'd probably have demurred. We extend our warmest sympathy to his devoted wife, Helen, and their son, David, his wife, Bonnie, and their two daughters. A memorial service will be held on Wednesday, March 29, at 2 P.M., at the West End Synagogue, 190 Amsterdam Avenue. Rabbi Avi Winokur Rabbi Yael Ridberg President Marcia Weller
