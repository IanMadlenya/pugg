        SNOW-Vernon F. The New York Law School community is sorrowed by the death of our friend, supporter and former faculty member, Vernon Snow. He was a trustee of the Snow Memorial Trust and President of the John Ben Snow Foundation, from which came the inspiration and support for the School's John Ben Snow Scholars' Program and The Snow Challenge Endowment Fund. Vernon Snow was an extraordinary scholar, historian and teacher. He leaves a legacy of his written work and personal integrity to all of us. We extend our condolences to Mr. Snow's wife Elizabeth.
