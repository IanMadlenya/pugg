        McKEAN-Q.A. Shaw Jr. The Board of Directors, Members and Staff of Fountain House express their deep sorrow on the loss of our friend and colleague Shaw. He became Treasurer in 1987 from 1990, served as the President of the Board for 3 years and later headed-up our successful Fund for Fountain House. He continued to serve as Treasurer until his death. Shaw's generosity of spirit, dedication, energy and talents have benefited all who came into contact with him, and his high standards of excellence have been a key ingredient in helping our clubhouse programs achieve national and international recognition for serving men and women with major mental illnesses. We extend our deepest sympathy to Linda and his family. His friendship and kindness will be missed by us all.
