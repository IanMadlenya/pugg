        ALDWELL--Edward. There was no finer performer of the works of J.S. Bach than pianist Edward Aldwell. His live recitals were life-changing experiences for his listeners, leaving indelible images etched in the memory. He was one of the great treasures of our musical community, and as one of many dedicated admirers, I mourn his loss with great sorrow and send sympathy to his wife Jean Ann. Norma Hurlburt
