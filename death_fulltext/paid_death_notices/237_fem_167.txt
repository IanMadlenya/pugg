The Officers, Board of Directors, Staff, Participants and members of AHRC New York City (The Association for the Help of Retarded Children) sadly mourn the passing of their founder, Ann Greenberg. Although Ann always described herself as an 'ordinary housewife', her vision, courage, determination and tenacity brought together forces that created AHRC New York City in 1949; the State Association (NYSARC Inc.), and the National Association (The Arc), the largest organizations in the city, state and country that provide services to thousands of individuals with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities. The programs and services created at AHRC are used throughout the world today. Ann remained an active member throughout her lifetime. We grieve for her and we extend deepest condolences to her family, her daughter Bonnie, and three grandchildren, Matthew, Sarah and Devin, at this sad time. The funeral will be held at Schwartz Brothers Funeral Home on Queens Boulevard in Forest Hills, 718-263-7600, on October 25th at 10:00 AMLaura Kennedy, President, AHRC New York City Michael Goldfarb, Executive Director, AHRC New York City
