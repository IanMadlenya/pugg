        LEVY-Pearl G. Died peacefully at the age of 101, after a lifetime of philanthropy and service to the less fortunate. She was the widow of the late Supreme Court Justice Matthew M. Levy and is survived by her sister Evelyne and sistersin-law Myra and Ruth. Although childless, she was the matriarch of an extended family of sisters and brothers, nieces and nephews, and great-nieces and great-nephews, who looked to her for inspiration, advice and guidance, which was generously and wisely given. Funeral services will be held at the Park Avenue Synagogue, 87th St. and Madison Ave., at 2 PM, on Monday February 14. Interment will be at the Bonaventure Cemetery in Savannah, GA, her childhood home, where her late husband is buried.
        LEVY - Pearl. The Officers, Trustees, Clergy and Members of Park Avenue Synagogue mourn the passing of a devoted congregant. We extend to the family our heartfelt sympathy. David H. Lincoln, Senior Rabbi Geoffrey J. Colvin, Ch. of the Bd. Paul S. Schreiber, President
