        HALL--Brenda. The staff of WQXR mourns the death of our friend and colleague Brenda Hall on May 30, 2004 after an extended illness. Brenda served as an Account Executive at WQXR for nearly fifteen years handling many of our travel, entertainment and corporate accounts. Prior to joining WQXR she worked at WMCA Radio, Caballero Radio, and at ABC Wide World of Sports. In addition she worked on the program 'Discovery.' ''The Great Brendini'' was a woman of cultivated tastes, great humor and keen insight. She will be sorely missed. Your friends and family at WQXR
