        CICCHINO-Peter. Died July 8, 2000. The Urban Justice Center laments the loss of our inspiration, our guide, our friend, Peter Cicchino. With heavy hearts and baffled minds we say good-bye to the best among us, may he rest in peace. And, if you have a chance, Peter, when you get to the top, please take the reins.
