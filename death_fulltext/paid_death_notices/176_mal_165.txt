        GARDNER-Douglas B. We, your parents, sister, wife and children, are devastated and will miss you forever. We feel lucky and blessed beyond words for every moment we shared with you. Your life was filled with countless loving and devoted friends who valued you beyond compare. You were our gentle giant who happily carried our burdens, who loved us unconditionally, whose warm smile lighted up a room and whose generosity was unparalleled. You were the perfect father to Michael and Julia and they reflect all that was good in you. The world has lost a man of pure heart.
