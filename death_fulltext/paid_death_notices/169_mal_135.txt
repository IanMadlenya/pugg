Following the war, he was assistant organist and carillonneur at Saint Thomas Church, 5th Avenue, NYC, from 1946-1952. Several of his early compositions have been published. He was greatly loved by all who knew him, especially those who sang in his choirs or studied with him, some of whom went on to careers in music. Along with musical training, he instilled principles of character and discipline, all with a wit and humor for which he was famous. He was a member of the St. Wilfrid Club of NYC and of the American Guild of Organists.
