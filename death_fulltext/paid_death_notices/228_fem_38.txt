        COSTA - GREENSPON -- Mur iel. It is with profound sadness that City Opera notes the passing of one of its most esteemed alumni and best friends. As a member of our company for over 30 years Muriel created some of the most vibrant and memorable characters in our opera repertory, in a wide variety of roles beginning with her debut as Olga Olsen in ''Street Scene'' in 1963. She gave us many memorable evenings in the theater with portrayals ranging from Assunta in ''The Saint of Bleecker Street'', Amelfa in ''Le Coq d'Or'', Diana Orsini in ''Bomarzo'', Genevieve in ''Pelleas et Melisande'', Cornelia in ''Giulio Cesare'', Mistress Quickly in ''Falstaff'', and the Mother in ''The Consul''; to Katisha in ''Mikado'', the Marquise in ''Daughter of the Regiment'', Bloody Mary in ''South Pacific'', Old Lady in ''Candide'', and the Grand Duchess in ''The Student Prince'' which she last performed in 1993. She was an exemplary colleague to her fellow performers and everyone else in the company and will be remembered with great affection. We extend our deepest condolences to her husband Giorgio, and her son Stefano, and all her many friends in the musical community. Paul Kellogg General Director
