        LARDNER-Ring, Jr. The Tisch School of the Arts mourns the passing of the great writer and dramatist, Ring Lardner, Jr. In his time teaching screenwriting in the Department of Dramatic Writing with Ian Hunter and with Waldo Salt, Mr. Lardner had a profound influence on his students. He was a teacher, a mentor, an inspiration, a model of integrity, engagement, and artistry. What he was and what he represented cannot be replaced. We shall miss him deeply.
