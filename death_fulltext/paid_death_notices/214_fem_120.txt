        FERRER--M. Irene. The Columbia University Medical Center community mourns the loss of one of its cardiology pioneers, Irene M. Ferrer, professor emeritus of clinical medicine. Dr. Ferrer was a graduate of and long-time faculty member at the College of Physicians & Surgeons (P&S). After graduating from P&S in 1941, she completed her internship at Columbia's Bellevue Hospital division and was the first woman to serve as chief resident in medicine there. As a faculty member, she worked with the Nobel Prize winning team that developed the cardiac catheter. She used the catheter to define the mechanism of action of several important cardiac medications, including digitalis, and outlined the pathophysiology of cardiac disease. During her 33 years as director of Presbyterian Hospital's electrocardiographic lab, she worked with IBM to develop the first software for the computer interpretation of the electrocardiogram. Influential in her field beyond Columbia, she had been editor in chief of Current Cardiology and the Journal of the American Medical Women's Association. Her legacy continues through the M. Irene Ferrer Professorship in Gender Specific Medicine at Columbia. Gerald D.
