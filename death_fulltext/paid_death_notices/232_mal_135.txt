        KUNITZ--Stanley. The Board and staff of Poets House mourn the passing of our cofounder, poet Stanley Kunitz. We celebrate the extraordinary life of artistry, generosity and integrity that Stanley led over his 100 years. His vision of community inspired Poets House, a home for poets and poetry lovers and a place where all are welcomed to step into the living tradition of the whole art. ''Poetry is the most indelible testimony we have of the adventures of the spirit,'' wrote Stanley. We know Stanley's spirited legacy will live on in his poems and the communities he helped to create and nurture.
