        SILVERMAN--Rabbi Israel. It is with great sorrow that the officers, Board of Directors and staff of the Masorti Foundation for Conservative Judaism in Israel and the Masorti Movement in Israel mourn the passing of Rabbi Israel Silverman, father of our President, Riva Silverman, on June 16, in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. He is survived by his wife Gloria and other children Judah, Ilana, Aviva, Devorah, their spouses and sixteen grandchildren. Rabbi Silverman was an inspiring leader in Conservative Judaism, and in Canadian Jewry. A scholar, a pastor, a teacher and a lover of Jews in the Diaspora and in Israel, he will be missed by many. Heartfelt sympathy is extended to the bereaved family. May they be comforted among all who mourn for Zion and Jerusalem. Shiva will be held at Gloria Silverman's home in Canada. Rabbi Gordon Tucker, Chairman of the Board >>AD#
