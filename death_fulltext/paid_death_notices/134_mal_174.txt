        WOLFF-Rene Ernest. On March 9, 1998 in Strasbourg, France. Lifelong resident of Kolbsheim. Born there August 11, 1911. Paula and Elaine Wolff sadly announce the death of cherished Leon, Sylvia, Achille and Raymonde's brother. He is survived by Marthe, his wise and radiant wife of 60 years, their daughters Liane (Marco) Meyer of St. Louis, France and Josette (Alain) Kaufman of Bne-Brak, Israel. 18 grandchildren and many great-grandchildren. Rene was a french soldier and prisoner of war, liberated by the American Army in 1945. We have all been touched by his sense of freedom, his great wit and intelligence, his devotion to country and homestead and love of our family's rich history. We miss him enormously. Our hearts go out to Marthe and all who loved him.
