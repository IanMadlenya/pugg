        RYLE-Joseph D. In memory of Uncle Joe, blithe spirit, loved by all who knew him. Dear Joe, May the road rise to meet you. May the wind be always at your back. May the sun shine warm upon your face, the rains fall soft upon your fields, and until we meet again, may God hold you in the palm of His hand. With love Kathy and John Slattery
