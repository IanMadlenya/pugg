        SAMUELS-Robert P. Born March 6, 1930, in Washington Heights, NY. Beloved husband of Shirley. Devoted father of Laurie and Jeffrey, and Steven and Janet. Loving poppa of Randy, Brian, Matthew and Julie. You will be missed not just as a husband, father and grandfather. You will be missed as the best friend anyone could ever have. Sharing life's joys and pleasures, you were also the one we all turned to for advice, to solve problems or to just make us feel better. How lucky we were to have had you there for us.
        SAMUELS-Robert P. For nearly 18 years I was blessed to know you. Our 6 AM coffee and conversations became a part of our daily lives and it was during that time you somehow managed to teach me everything I know. You gave me unconditional love and respect that will never be matched. It will never be the same here without you. Jane
