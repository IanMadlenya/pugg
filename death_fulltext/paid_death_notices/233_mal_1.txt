        ALDWELL - Edward. Mannes College and The New School mourn the passing of Edward Aldwell, distinguished pianist, educator, learned musician, and scholar. Over several decades, Ed taught and helped launch the careers of many pianists, unstintingly imparting his knowledge and artistry to generations of students. His groundbreaking text, ''Harmony and Voice Leading'' (co-authored with Carl Schachter), helped transform the teaching of music theory throughout the world. His immensely intelligent performances and recordings, especially of the music of J.S. Bach, are widely appreciated. He generously supported Mannes in all ways. A genuinely wise and gentle soul in an era with few such people, his presence will be sorely missed.
