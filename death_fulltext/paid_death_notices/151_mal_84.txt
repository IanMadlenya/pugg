        MARKS-Doris. The Board of Directors, residents and staff of The Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale mourn with sorrow the death of Doris Marks. We extend our sincere sympathy to her grandson, Evan Marks, esteemed colleague and member of The Hebrew Home Board of Directors, his wife, Dr. Janice Marks, and the entire Marks family.
