        SCHAEFFER--Irene. Chai Lifeline mourns the recent death of Irene Schaeffer, beloved mother of Richard Schaeffer, generous benefactor, Awards Dinner Chairman, 2005 Man of the Year, and a good friend to our children. Mrs. Schaeffer's halfcentury of philanthropy was a lifelong lesson for her children. She leaves a legacy of kindness and concern for others that is a model not only for Richard and his siblings, Susan and Hal Martin, and Donald and Joan Schaeffer, but for all of us. May the family be comforted among the mourners of Zion. Chai Lifeline Samuel Zaks, Executive Director, Development
