        OSTROW-Barney. It is with deepest sorrow that we announce the passing on November 14, 2001 of our beloved husband, father, father-in-law, poppie, brother, uncle, cousin and friend and all around inspiration. Barney was born on the Lower Eastside of New York City of Russian, Jewish immigrant parents. From these humble roots, he grew a long-lived, successful physical therapy practice that touched many patients' lives. His amazing gifts of healing heart and hands transformed all those who knew him. He is survived by his wife Ida, children Jane Lazere, Flora and Gary, their partners Richard, Betsy and Pam, grandchildren Briana & Rebecca, sister Sarah Music and their many extended family members and friends. We will hold him in our hearts forever. Services 12:00 PM November 16 at Plaza Jewish Community Chapel, 91st Street and Amsterdam Avenue.
