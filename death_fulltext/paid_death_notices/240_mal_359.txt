        WEINBERG--Samuel M.D. The faculty, alumni, residents and staff of the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology of New York University School of Medicine record with profound sadness the passing of our esteemed and beloved colleague, Dr. Samuel Weinberg, an internationally recognized pioneer in the field of Pediatric Dermatology. Dr. Weinberg established the first clinic in Pediatric Dermatology at Bellevue Hospital in 1962 and continued to be actively involved in patient care and teaching there and at NYU until his untimely demise. His Atlas of Pediatric Dermatology has been for decades one of the most popular books in the specialty. His passing is a great loss to his patients and all who trained or worked with this wonderful man. We will sorely miss his warmth, humor, energy and advice. We offer our sincerest condolences to his wife, Pearl, his children, and their family. Seth J. Orlow, M.D., Ph.D. Chairman and Samuel Weinberg Professor of Pediatric Dermatology NYU School of Medicine
