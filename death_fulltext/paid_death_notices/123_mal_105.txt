        COHEN-Irving S. May 6, 1928 to April 9, 1996. A very sad year has passed. Disbelief and pain still burn in our hearts. Dreams and plans forever scattered. God sent you to us and you brought love, beauty, laughter into our lives. He's called you home now. I'm glad He loaned you to us and we had these many years. We love and miss you. Your Wife, Mary Children, Grandchildren
