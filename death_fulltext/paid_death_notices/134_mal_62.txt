        KASS-Dr. Morton. All of us at the East Midwood Jewish Center mourn the passing of the brother of our distinguished and beloved rabbi, Dr. Alvin Kass. Rabbi Kass' brother was an eminent physician in Paterson, New Jersey, who dispensed his medical skills with humaneness and spiritual sensitivity. We pray that God will comfort Rabbi Kass and all the members of the bereaved family. Marsha Shlefstein, President Harvey Marks, Executive Director
