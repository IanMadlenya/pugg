        GANG--Lawrence. On August 9, 2005. Loving brother of Carolyn Gang Troob. Devoted uncle of Douglas and Peter. Loving friend of Lyn Segal. Services Thursday 9:30AM at ''The Riverside,'' 76th St. and Amsterdam Ave.
        GANG -- Lawrence, passed away on Tuesday. Larry, a lifetime friend, was an extraordinarily warm, caring person. He never hesitated to help or advise others, and never asked for anything in return. He was a fun-loving bachelor most of his life, and recently settled down after meeting a very special woman. Larry was loved by everyone who was fortunate enough to know him well, and he will be sorely missed. He was taken from us unexpectedly and way too soon. In the ''Match of Life,'' Larry was truly a champion. Bob Goldstein and family (Judy, Loren and Alex)

        GANG--Larry. Our heartfelt condolences to Carolyn. Larry's spirit will always be with us. Larry and Denise Wohl
