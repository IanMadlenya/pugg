        BERNSTEIN-Frank. With deep sorrow the Board of Directors of River Point Towers mourns the passing of our devoted Secretary and fellow Director. His ability to offer practical solutions to complex problems in a most professional and good natured way will be sorely missed. Our deepest sympathies are with his wife Marcia, daughters Brenda and Abigail, son-in-law Michael and all of his loving family members. Edward L. Scharf, President For the Board of Directors
