        FARKAS-Dr. Ervin. Who lived life on his own terms, sharing his intellect and acute insight into the human condition with those fortunate enough to cross his path, passed away on January 5, 2003. A Holocaust survivor, who, as President of the World Federation of Hungarian Jews, dedicated his life to the continuation of Hungarian Jewish culture in America, was an author, editor, publisher, attorney and chessmaster. He is survived by Iby, his wife of sixty three years, sons George and Peter, daughters-in-law Betty and Leslie, grandchildren Michael, Randi, Max and Laura. He truly mattered and made a difference.
