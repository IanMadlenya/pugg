        NEUMAN-Bertha. Boys Town Jerusalem mourns the passing of a cherished member of its extended family, and wife of our esteemed Board Member, Mr. Irving Neuman. Most of all we express our sorrow at the loss of a valued friend. Bea was a warm and caring soul whose love for her family was both legendary and inspirational. A partner in life and philanthropy with her devoted husband, the Neumans shared their blessings to improve the quality of life for countless others. They regarded the students of Boys Town as ''their boys'', endowing The Irving and Bea Neuman Electronics Laboratory and the Irving and Bea Neuman Major Scholarship Endowment, to provide disadvantaged Israeli youth a brighter future. May Bea's lifetime boundless good ensure her rightful place in Heaven and be a source of blessing to all. We extend heartfelt condolences to the entire family and pray that Bea Neuman's soul will be bound in the bond of life eternal. Josh S. Weston, Chairman Alexander S. Linchner, Vice Chair Rabbi Moshe Linchner, Dean Rabbi Ronald L. Gray, Exec. V.P.
