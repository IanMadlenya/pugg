        BIGEL-Jacob (Jack). Age 89, on Nov. 28th, 2002. Beloved husband of Ruth, devoted father of Jonathan Bigel and Elizabeth Meyers and dedicated father-in-law to Barbara Bigel, adored grandfather of Jordan, Daniel, Deborah, Michael and David and greatgrandfather to Jonah, Rachel, Alexander, Andrew, Noah and Cole. Loving brother of Rose. Services to be held at Riverside Chapel, West 76th & Amsterdam in Manhattan on Sunday, December 1st at 11:45AM. History will record your role as a revered New York labor leader who fought for the working man and woman, a man whose principles and ethics stood as a rock against a turbulent time when the very dignity of labor was under assault. The annals of New York will also show that you were among the handful of leaders who prevented our beloved city from sliding into the abyss of bankruptcy during the 1970's and, as founder Program Planners, Inc., you became one of the most respected experts in municipal finance in the nation. You leave a behind a family that grieves for a life that has ended but enormously proud of the living legacy that you left us and all New Yorkers.
