        GREEN-Bertha K. We mourn the passing of the mother of Morris L. Green, who along with his beloved wife Charlotte, were of the original founders of the new Shaare Zedek Medical Center. The tradition of tzedaka and chesed faithfully fulfilled by Morris is a legacy of a mother who imbued her son with Torah values. There is no institution or cause that furthers the survival of Klal and Yisrael, be it spiritual or physical continuity, where the name of Morris Green is not found. The memory of Mrs. Green will long remain through the acts of commitment of Am Yisrael, Torat Yisrael and Eretz Yisrael as expressed in so many ways by Morris and his beloved wife. May the family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. American Committee for Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem Charles H. Bendheim, President Erica Jesselson, Chairperson of the Board Sidney G. Adler, Treasurer International Board of Governors Menno Ratzker, Chairman Morris Talansky, Executive Vice Chairman
