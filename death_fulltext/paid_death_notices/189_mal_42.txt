        GOLDBERG-Richard A. The City College of New York mourns the passing of Judge Richard A. Goldberg, a graduate of the Class of 1951, past president of the CCNY Alumni Association and former Board member of The City College Fund. Judge Goldberg was a staunch supporter of his Alma Mater and the cause of public higher education. On behalf of City College's students, faculty and staff I wish to extend our deepest sympathy to his family. Dr. Gregory H. Williams President The City College of New York/CUNY
