        GANZ-Sally, on January 27th, 1997. The Whitney Museum of American Art notes with great sadness the passing of Sally Ganz, beloved wife of the late Victor W. Ganz, a former Trustee and Vice President of the Museum. Together with her husband, she was a true friend and a generous benefactor. We extend our deepest sympathies to their children and grandchildren. She will be missed by all. Whitney Museum of American Art Flora M. Biddle, Honorary Chairman Leonard A.
