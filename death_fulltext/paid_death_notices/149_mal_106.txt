        CHENKIN-Alvin. Age 80, formerly of Teaneck, NJ, now of Media, Pennsylvania died peacefully on Sunday, June 6, 1999 after a very courageous struggle with congestive heart failure. His family wishes him a good journey-we will miss him but he gave us the tools we need to go on without him. He was predeceased by his beloved and cherished wife, Beatrice Glotzer Chenkin whom he never stopped missing. He is survived by his children, Shura, Debbie and Carl, his in-laws, Joseph Sullivan, Donald Steele and Sarah Whitcher Chenkin and his beloved grandchildren, Elise, Sam and Beatrice. He worked for 38 years at the Council of Jewish Federations in New York City and was proud to have served as President of Union Local 107, a constituent of District Council 1707. A man of unbending will, strength of character and extremely wry sense of humor-he will be deeply missed by his family. Funeral services will be private. Contributions may be made in his memory to the Jewish Labor Committee or the Jacob Zukerman Fund of the Workmen's Circle/Arbeter Ring. Information: Wien and Wien Funeral Home.
