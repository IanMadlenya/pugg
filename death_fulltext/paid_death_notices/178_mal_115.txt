        SILVERMAN - Frederick, M.D. Drs. Barbara Edelstein and Kenneth Goldman mourn the passing of Dr. Fred Silverman. He was a doctor's doctor who served as a role model of honor, decorum and intellectual curiosity. He never considered night call an interruption of his evening activities, but the focus of his night. Dr. Silverman was a man of letters who could intelligently discourse and teach his companions on a wide variety of subjects from sports to ancient lore. Most importantly of all, Fred was a close friend whose company, with his wife Marilyn, we cherished. We will miss him.
