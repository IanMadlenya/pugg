        ELIEL--Lisa S. (DuBose) has left us for a better party, but we don't think the hors d'oeuvres there will be nearly as good as her own. Her two children, Brooke and Hunter, loving husband of 14 years, Peter, brother, John, and cuddly confidant, Bear, regret they are unable to attend (and, besides, they aren't on the guest list). Please join us to celebrate her life at 5:30 PM on Wednesday, September 14th at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street. Her garden is still flourishing so please do not send flowers.
