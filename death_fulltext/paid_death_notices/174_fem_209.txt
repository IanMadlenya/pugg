        McNEIVE-Joan Scarangello, 47. Beloved wife, stepmother, daughter, sister, auntie, godmother, friend. Bronx-born, graduate of Cardinal Spellman High School and American University, Joan's heart directed her life personally and professionally. Whether in fanatic support of her Yankees or in political debate, Joan was an indefatigable champion of whom and what she loved. Joan was smart funny-and you challenged her positions at your own risk. Her physical and mental energy and her love of language led to a distinguished career in journalism. She began her writing and producing career at the NBC Washington Bureau, followed by WRC Radio, and then moved to New York to join ABC Radio, followed by ABCTV's World News Tonight and World News Now. Since 1997, she worked as a senior writer for Tom Brokaw at NBC Nightly News. Ultimately Joan's fine sense memory and love of reading called her to shift her focus to fiction. In the last two years she was writing a novel based loosely on the life of her maternal grandparents. Her family and friends will forever miss her humor, smile, passion, loyalty and inexhaustible love. Joan is survived by her husband, Patrick McNeive; stepdaughter, Frances McNeive; father and stepmother, Frank and Doris Scarangello; her sister and brother-in-law, Mary Ann Tighe and Dr. David Hidalgo; her brother and sister-inlaw, Tom Scarangello & Roxanne Donovan; her nephew, Aaron Tighe and his wife, Kimberly, and nephews, Elliot and Anthony Scarangello. Funeral services will be held on Monday, July 30th, 10 AM, at All Souls Church, 1157 Lexington Ave. at 80th St. In lieu of flowers, please send contributions to fight lung cancer: Thoracic Oncology Service Research Fund, C/O Dr. Mark G. Kris, MSKCC, 1275 York Ave., New York, New York 10021.
