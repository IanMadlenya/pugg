        GOODWIN-William. The Board, staff and community of the Hamilton-Madison Settlement House on Manhattan's Lower East Side, are deeply saddened by the passing of its immediate past President and current Chairman of the Board. We will miss the great contributions, legal expertise and love that Will bought to this one hundred year old Settlement House in his unassuming, quiet but determined manner. The entire Hamilton-Madison House family extends its deepest sympathy to his beloved wife, Maria, his sons, Andrew and Peter and the rest of his family. Will, you will be sorely missed at the House.
