        SIMON--David O. Epstein Becker & Green, P.C. mourns the passing of our esteemed partner David O. Simon. David was an outstanding lawyer, noted for his honesty, integrity, good humor, creativity and commitment to the practice of law. He will be greatly missed as a friend and colleague. David was a member of the New York State Hospital Review and Planning Council and was active in numerous other professional and civil organizations, including the New York State Bar Association's Health Law Section and the American Health Lawyers Association. He was a member of the Board of Directors of the Committee for Modern Courts, and was past chair of the Corporate Counsel Section of the New York County Lawyers Association. David also served as Deputy Assistant Attorney General and Counselor to the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights in the United States Department of Justice in Washington, D.C. In that position, he directed all employment discrimination suits brought by the Department of Justice and was extensively involved in negotiating the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which significantly amended Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and with promulgation of the Justice Department's regulations implementing the Americans with Disabilities Act. Our thoughts and prayers are with Judy, Molly, Henry and the rest of Davids family.
