        DeLAY--Nellis. The entire School for Strings family mourns the death on May 27, just short of her 85th birthday, of Nellis DeLay, a longtime member of the School's cello and chamber music faculties. Preceded in death by her husband Clifford Harvuot, for many years a principal singer with the Metropolitan Opera, and her sister Dorothy DeLay, the distinguished violin teacher, she is survived by her daughter Susan Harvuot and her son Clifford Harvuot, both of Rockland County, NY, and her sister Louise DeLay Carlson of Albuquerque, NM. Nellis was a graduate of the Oberlin Conservatory and The Juilliard Graduate School, where she studied with Felix Salmond. A beautiful player as well as an exceptional teacher, she served for many years as principal cellist of the New York City Ballet Orchestra. She was a very special person, and will be sorely missed by her many students, colleagues and friends.
