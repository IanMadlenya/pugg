        JAFFE-Ralph. The Officers, Board of Directors, and staff of American ORT, deeply mourn the passing of its long-time generous supporter and friend, who served as an officer and member of our Board for many years, was a founder of our Plumbers and Real Estate Divisions, and the recipient of The American ORT William Haber Award for distinguished service in 1991. Educated at The ORT School in Kovno, Lithuania in the 1930's, Ralph was a major contributor to ORT Guttman in Netanya and ORT Syngalowski in Tel-Aviv, Israel. A founder of ORT Braude in Karmiel, Israel, his commitment to the global mission of ORT is his legacy to ORT students worldwide. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Trudy, two children, Leonard and Rochelle, and five grandchildren. Michael R. Stoler, Pres. Joe Cohen, First VP Brian J. Strum, Exec. VP Paul I. Bernick, Exec Dir Emeritus
