        von STADE--Philip R., Sr. of Locust Valley, NY, Prouts Neck, ME, and Spring Island, SC, after a long and valiant battle with cancer died March 16, 2004. He was 75. A loving father and husband, a trusted advisor to many, a great sportsman and philanthropist, he had strength and good humor to the end and will be missed by all who knew him. Born June 8, 1928, the son of F. Skiddy von Stade and Kathryne Steele von Stade, he grew up with his seven brothers and sisters in Old Westbury, NY and Aiken, SC. He graduated from St. Paul's School in Concord, NH, Amherst College and the University of Virginia Law School. While he practiced law at the outset of his career, he soon moved to Scudder, Stevens & Clark--an investment advisory firm, where he spent almost 40 years as a Partner and Managing Director. He served on the boards of the Saratoga Museum of Racing, Greenvale School and Piping Rock Club. For the last 10 years he served as President and then Chairman of the Board of the Shelburne Museum in Shelburne, Vermont. Under his leadership this remarkable institution made many outstanding changes that enhanced its reputation, its collections and its financial strength. He is survived by his wife of 53 years, Marjorie Mueller von Stade, five children: Philip (Jr.) and MaryAnne von Stade, Robert and Elizabeth (Munson) von Stade, Richard and Kimberly von Stade, Kathryne and Brett Lewis, F. Skiddy (III) and Elizabeth von Stade; and nine grandchildren, the most recent having been joyfully introduced to him only a short time before his death. He is also survived by four siblings -- Frederick, John, Kathryne Krumpe and Nannie Ward. Friends may attend a memorial service Friday, April 30 at 11am in St. John's of Lattingtown with the Rev. Foster officiating. Interment will be private. In lieu of flowers, the family ask that gifts be made to the Shelburne Museum, P.O. Box 10, Shelburne, Vermont 05482
