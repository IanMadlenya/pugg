A life-long New Yorker, resident of Great Neck, NY and Sarasota, FL.

He was a caring and intelligent attorney, a creative artist, a fan of Shakespeare and the Marx Brothers, hilarious and wry observer, and, above all, a moral man. He will be deeply missed by all who knew and loved him. A funeral service will be held on Sunday, November 10 at 12:45 PM at Riverside Memorial Chapel, Amsterdam Avenue and 76th Street in Manhattan.
