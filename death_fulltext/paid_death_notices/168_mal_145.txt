        MARSHALL-Victor F., M.D. The Boards, Faculty, and Staff of Weill Medical College of Cornell University and New York-Presbyterian Hospital mourn the passing of our distinguished colleague Victor F. Marshall, M.D. Dr. Marshall, who was born in Culpeper, Virginia, attended Washington and Lee University and the University of Virginia. After receiving his medical degree from the University of Virginia, he completed a surgery internship and subsequent surgery and urology residencies at The New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. From 1946 to 1976, he was Chief of the Division of Urology at our institution, and was the first James J. Colt Professor of Urology. As a clinician, a researcher, and an educator, Dr. Marshall was a national leader. He made significant contributions in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence, bladder cancer, and pediatric urology, trained many chairmen of urology around the country, and won most of the highest awards in the field. In 1987, he received the Maurice R. Greenberg Distinguished Service Award, New York-Cornell's highest honor. We extend our deepest condolences to his family. Antonio M. Gotto, Jr., M.D., D.Phil.
