        CRAVIOTO-Humberto, M., MD. The Faculty and Staff of NYU School of Medicine and The NYU Medical Center mourn the passing of Humberto M. Cravioto, MD, Professor of Pathology, at age 75. Dr. Cravioto joined NYU in 1957 and served its community for 42 years. Dr. Cravioto was an accomplished neuropathologist best known for his work on the electromicroscopy of brain tumors. He was also a dedicated teacher and a gentle compassionate man who was well appreciated by his colleagues and friends. Dr. Cravioto is survived by his wife, Barbara and their three children, Stefanie, Jorge and David. We extend our deepest sympathies to his entire family. Robert M. Glickman, MD Dean, NYU School of Medicine Theresa A. Bischoff President, NYU Hospitals Center Vittorio Defendi, MD May Ellen and Gerald Jay Ritter Professor of Oncology and Chairman, Department of Pathology, NYU School of Medicine
