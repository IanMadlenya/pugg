        NAGAMATSU-George R., MD. New York Medical College is saddened by the passing of our alumnus, esteemed colleague and friend, Dr. George R. Nagamatsu, distinguished Emeritus Professor of Urology and Chairman of the Dept. of Urology for 15 years. A 1934 graduate of the School of Medicine, Dr. Nagamatsu devoted nearly his entire career to the College. Decorated by Japan's Consulate General and awarded the Valentine Medal, one of the highest honors in urology, he was a pioneering surgeon, urologist and engineer. We extend our sympathy to his wife and family. Ronald F. Poe, Chairman Board of Trustees Rev. Msgr. Harry C. Barrett, D.Min., MPH President and CEO Ralph A.
