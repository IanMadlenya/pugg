        ALTMANN-Dr. Minna. We extend heartfelt condolences to Dr. Vladamir Altmann and Dr. Thomas Altmann on the loss of their beloved wife and mother. A kind and gentle woman with a radiant smile, Minna's outstretched hand of kindness and exceptional devotion to Israel helped bring joy, happiness and healing to thousands of people in Jerusalem. A member of the National Women's Division Board, her dedication, friendship and support to the Hospital was exemplary. May the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
