        ABRAMSON--Ruth. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum mourns the passing of Ruth Abramson. A Museum Founder, she and her husband Albert were among its most pivotal leaders. Their vision that the lessons of the Holocaust are vital to the nation and their extraordinary generosity helped create the Museum. The Abramson Family supported the construction of the Museum as well as many educational and scholarly programs, including the Abramson Archives, the world's most comprehensive collection of its kind. The Museum extends its deepest condolences to Albert, who served on the Museum's Council for 15 years, to Ronald, Gary and Jeffrey, and to the entire Abramson Family. Fred S. Zeidman, Chairman Joel M. Geiderman, Vice Chairman Sara J. Bloomfield, Director United States Holocaust Memorial Museum
