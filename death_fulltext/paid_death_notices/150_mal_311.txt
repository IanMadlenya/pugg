        SHEIN-Joseph, MD. Adored by his loving wife Osnass (nee Charchat) of 53 years. Adoring children, Dr. Ruvan and Karen Shein, Avrom Shein, Dr. Leon and Jill Shein. Cherished grandchildren Arianna, Rebekah, Mariessa, Joshua, Benjamin, Jonathan, Allison. Loving family, devoted friends, patients, colleagues, nurses, and the North Shore Hospital administration and staff are in inconsolable pain and grief. How do you let go a legend as courageous, compassionate, brilliant, caring, with sense of humor, moral ethical standards which knows no equal. Capacity to love and be loved. Took care of the needy, heal the sick and gave credence to the meaning of life. You justified the ten commandments. With aching hearts, never say goodbye darling. We will meet again and continue the wonders of our fortunate, tranquil, happy cultured life as a family who was inspired by your passionate love and devotion. A man of class, dignity, nobility. Thank you my husband, thank you dad, thank you grandpa (Pappa) Joe, for being our greatest gift. Deep emotional love and tears will never cease.
