        FEENEY-Jim. All his long term friends and colleagues at ABC Sports mourn the death of ''Doc'' who passed away on January 6, after a long and valiant battle. His strength throughout his ordeal strengthened each and every one of us at ABC Sports. To know Jim was to experience the true meaning of ''first class.'' A pioneer in the world of Network Sports Television, he served in many capacities during his career at ABC which started in 1959. Jim graduated from Notre Dame in 1958 and kept the fighting Irish with him right up to the end. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his wife Barbara, and his daughter Barbara Colleen, who devoted every ounce of energy to Jim in his final days. The time and place of a Memorial Service will be announced in the near future. ''Doc,'' we'll see you on the first tee.
