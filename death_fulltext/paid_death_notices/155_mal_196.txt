He was especially committed to helping those living in the developing world who suffer from treatable causes of blindess. Peter La Hay was an inspiration to every member of the ORBIS family. His enthusiasm for ORBIS also moved others to join him in generously supporting our work. We express our heartfelt sympathies to his wife, Sandy, his children, his grandchildren and to the employess of La Hay Laboratories and NEOPTX. A. L.
