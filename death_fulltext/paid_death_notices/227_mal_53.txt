        ROSENTHAL--Marvin. We join the Rosenthal family in mourning the loss of our friend and colleague, Marvin Rosenthal. Marvin was a cherished member of the CBRE family for the past six years and a highly regarded member of the New York City real estate community. Marvin was full of vigor and optimism, even as he waged a fierce fight following complications from surgery. His spirit, courage and dignity are an inspiration to us all. Our thoughts and prayers go out to Marvin's family, including his wife Elaine, daughter Jane Knudsen, son-in-law Chris Knudsen, and three grandchildren, as well as to his longtime friend and business partner, Paul Muratore. We will miss Marvin dearly. CB Richard Ellis $(6$)ROSENTHAL--Marvin. Loving devoted husband, father and grandfather.
