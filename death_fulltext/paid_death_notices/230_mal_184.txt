He served on the Board's Executive Committee and, in 2003 became a Life Trustee. We feel a profound sense of privilege to have benefited from Mr. Pearson's warmth and wisdom and extend our heartfelt sympathy to his wife Joanne and daughter Jill Rappaport. Kenneth G.

The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn the passing of Andrall Pearson, a dedicated Honorary Trustee of the Museum and a longtime colleague and friend. Andy and his family formed an outstanding collection of ancient ceramic sculpture made in the western region of Mexico, and many of those objects were put on view in the stunning ''Heritage of Power'' exhibition at the Metropolitan in 2004 and generously promised as gifts to this museum. We are most grateful for his involvement here, as he was always generous with his invaluable advice and counsel. We will miss him greatly, and send condolences to his wife Joey, daughter Jill, son-in-law Alan, and the entire family. James R. Houghton, Chrmn Philippe de Montebello, Dir. Emily K. Rafferty, President
