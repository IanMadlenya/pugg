        DORFMAN-Janis (Marks). Died Saturday, August 23, 1997, after a valiant battle with ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease). Loving wife of Michael; adored mother of Alyssa Scherer and Andrew; beautiful daughter of Evelyn and Stanley Marks; wonderful sister of Martin, and sister-in-law Grace, and aunt to many nephews and nieces; mother-in-law of Donald Scherer. An advocate for many ALS patients stricken with this horrible and devestating disease. Appeared twice before the FDA and appealed to them to approve a drug so that lives may be extended if only for a few months. Both times the FDA disapproved her plea. Appeared as a prime guest on last year's Jerry Lewis Telethon. Janis was a reading teacher for many years in McVey Elementary School in East Meadow, NY. In lieu of flowers, please make contributions to The Janis Dorfman Research Foundation, ALS Association, 21021 Ventura Blvd, Suite 321, Woodland Hills, CA 91364-2206.
