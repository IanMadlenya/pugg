        FRIEDLANDER - Christine. Be loved mother of Eva and David, grandmother of George Koudjo, died June 6 in New York City. Her gentle and giving nature made her a wonderful mother, a true friend and delightful companion. Her deep and abiding concern for peace and justice, and her love of art and beauty guided her throughout life. We will miss her always.
