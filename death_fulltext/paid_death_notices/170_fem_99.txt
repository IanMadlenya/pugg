        FELDMAN-Adele. The Directors, Campers and Alumni of Camp Robindel for Girls in New Hampshire are deeply sadden by the passing of Adele Feldman. As one of the Founders, she and her late husband, Paddy along, with Eli and Fanny Robinson touched and enriched the lives of many young women during her tenure 1951-1977. We extend our heartfelt condolences to her daughter Bette Zorn, grandsons Michael and Matthew and the entire family. Camp Robindel for Girls Ann and Nat Greenfield Owners and Directors
