        JANKOFF-Edith. Edith Jankoff was devoted to our work. She combined a wholehearted commitment to Israel with a zest for life, bridge, earthy humor and sociability. To know Edith well was to love her. We join her family in mourning her loss and extend to them our deepest sympathy. We shall all miss her. Harriet Lainer, President Women's League for Israel
