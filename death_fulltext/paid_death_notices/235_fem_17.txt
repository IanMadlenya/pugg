        LOEFFLER--Bella, 86. Bella would have needed 100 more years, at least, to cram in all the things she wanted to see and do. Such was her joy of life. A life filled with family and friends who adored her, who she in turn loved dearly. Memorial Friday, August 4, 11AM, at Schwartz Brothers Memorial Chapel, 114-03 Queens Blvd. (at 76th Road), Forest Hills, NY.
