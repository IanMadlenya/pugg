        SCHLEICHER--Ellen Marsh, August 2, 1932 to February 6, 2007. Our dear Ellen, loving wife to Barret T. Schleicher and mother to David M. Schleicher and Mark A.D. Schleicher. Painting and drawing were her passions. She studied under Xavier Gonzalez and Don Stacy. She exhibited her work in New York City. She taught art at the Spence School, the Museum of Modern Art and NYU. But she always put family and friends first. Her sunny disposition, zest and enthusiasm for life and nature were contagious. She enriched us all beyond measure. She will be deeply missed. Services will be announced at a later date in the spring.
