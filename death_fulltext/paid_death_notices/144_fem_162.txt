        GROSS-Ruth Littman. Passed in peace on January 13 in her 85th year after a long and debilitating illness.

She will live forever in the hearts of her children Rollie (Littman) and Samuel Antupit, Sandra (Littman) and Jon Kates, Arthur and Susan Littman, 10 grandchildren, and 10 great grandchildren-a woman of unsurpassed beauty and consummate grace.
