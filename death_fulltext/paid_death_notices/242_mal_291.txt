        ROSIN--Axel. The officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the loss of Axel Rosin, a treasured leader who was deeply devoted to the Jewish people and cultural arts initiatives. Axel upheld his familys commitment to tikkun olam and has made an indelible impact through his generosity and vision. We extend our deepest sympathies to his beloved wife; Kathy; to his daughters, Karen Sollins and Susanna Bergtold; to his grandchildren, Peter and Amy; and to the entire family. Morris W. Offit, President Susan K. Stern, Chair of the Board John S. Ruskay, Exec. V.P. & C.E.O.
