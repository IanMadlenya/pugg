        BLUM-Robert E. The Board and staff of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Inc. mourn the passing of Robert E. Blum, director emeritus since 1969. A major supporter of many New York institutions, he was crucial to the development of Lincoln Center, having served as treasurer from 1956 to 1963. In those years he made his greatest contribution as a problem-solver, a strong yet self-effacing personality who could bring together people with different points of view. We extend our condolences to his children, John and Alice, and to his grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Beverly Sills, Chairman Nathan Leventhal, President Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Inc.
