        STILES--Laura, age 12, died December 22, 2006 in Morristown, NJ of the difficult - to - cure childhood cancer, Neuroblastoma. She received treatment in Morristown Memorial Hospital, NJ. Memorial Sloan - Kettering, NY and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Her young life, so keenly enjoyed, and her potential in math, drawing and music, were forever snuffed out by this sinister disease. The challenge of finding a cure for Neuroblastoma deserves keen support so that beautiful, otherwise healthy, vibrant children will no longer be taken from us. Memorial service in January at Morristown Unitarian Fellowship. Details at: www.caringbridge.org/visit/ laurastiles
