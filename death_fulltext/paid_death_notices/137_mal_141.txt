        DELLAROCCA - Dominic. Shocked at the sudden passing of ''Dom'' Della Rocca, a giant of a man. His energy, drive and committment to the unfortunate and underprivileged children of the State and City of New York is legendary. His charm, enthusiasm, unselfishness and dedication will be missed by all of the Mayors of the State of New York and by our family who loved him dearly. Maxine, Tad, Marge, Matt and Jerome Belson
