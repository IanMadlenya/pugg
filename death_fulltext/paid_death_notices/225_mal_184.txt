        SNOKE--Gerald R. October 18, 1921-July 18, 2005. ''Let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments. Love is not love which alters when it alteration finds or bends with the remover to remove. Love's not times fool ''though rosy lips and cheeks within his bending sickle's compass come...oh no! It is an ever fixed mark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.''
