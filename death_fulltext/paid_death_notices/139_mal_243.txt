        SUALL-Irwin J. The Anti-Defamation League mourns the passing of one of our longtime civil rights professionals, Irwin J. Suall, who was a brilliant and resourceful ADL activist for over thirty years. Irwin was key to the League's leadership in the fight against antiSemitism, racism and organized hate. We extend our deepest and heartfelt sympathy to his son Mark and his sister-in-law Joan. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem, secure in the knowledge of his solid legacy of service and his indelible place in the hearts and minds of his colleagues. Abraham H. Foxman, National Director Elizabeth J. Coleman, Director Civil Rights Gail L. Gans, Director Fact Finding
