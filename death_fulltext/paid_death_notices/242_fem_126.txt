        GREENE--Norma. Maimonides Medical Center mourns the passing of our dear friend Norma Greene, an esteemed Honorary Board Member and longstanding contributor to the medical center. Norma served as President of the Maimonides Women's Auxiliary for 26 years, led a dedicated group of volunteers, and was recognized for spearheading the library and newborn photography programs. She brought warmth and style to everything she did. She will be sorely missed. Her contributions to the Maimonides community will forever be appreciated. Our deep condolences to her family. Martin D. Payson, Chair, Board of Trustees; Pamela S. Brier, President and CEO, Maimonides Medical Center
