        FELDMAN--Sandra. It is with a great sense of loss that we mourn the passing of Sandy Feldman. She was a labor leader whose strategic sharpness helped move forward the struggle of New York and the Nation's teachers in forging an educational community focused on bringing out the best in both its students and teachers. She fought hard for their needs. Her insights and leadership will be missed. Our sympathy goes out to her husband Arthur Barnes and to her colleagues in the AFT and UFT.
