        KRAMER - KOEHLER - Pamela, Ph.D. The entire Polytechnic University community mourns the passing of Pamela Kramer-Koehler, an esteemed professor with a 25 year legacy of dedicated service to our institution and its students. Trained in developmental psychology and psycholinguistics, Professor Kramer-Koehler will long be remembered as a champion of science, mathematics and computer education for special populations such as women and minorities. She was that exemplary academic who managed to combine her scholarly interest in gender equity in computer-related learning with a strong commitment to equal opportunity for all. At the University and in her home community of Carroll Gardens in Brooklyn, she helped thousands of students find their way to successful technology-based careers. We will sorely miss her presence, commitment and example, and extend our heartfelt condolences to her daughter, Abigail, and her son, Robert. Dr. David C. Chang, President Arthur C. Martinez Chairman, Board of Trustees
