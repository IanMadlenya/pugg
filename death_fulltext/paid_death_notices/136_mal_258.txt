        ROTHBARDT-Seymour. The Accident Prevention & Safety League notes with sorrow the death of Seymour Rothbardt. Seymour served as President of the League for over 25 years and was instrumental in developing and promoting its insurance programs for the Building Maintenance Industry. His gruff exterior could not conceal his warm heart or the love he felt for family and friends. To his dear wife, Charlotte, and his beloved children Patty and Mitchell we extend our heartfelt condolences. Stanley Doobin, President Louis Dauber, Vice President George Gersten, Secretary Philip Bell, Treasurer Joseph M. Gnesin, Manager
