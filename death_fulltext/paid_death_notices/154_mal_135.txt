        LOMNITZ-Eric.All his friends and associates in the AIMCOR companies in the U.S., U.K., Luxembourg, Holland and Germany for whom he was a founding father of our current businesses, will miss his humor, enthusiasm, advice and example. So much of what we are today as individuals and as a business we have learned from Eric. We share the grief of his family as our own.
