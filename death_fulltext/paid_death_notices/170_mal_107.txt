        JAKUBOVITZ-Jerome R. The staff of Jerome Haims Realty mourn the loss of our friend and mentor Jerome Jakubovitz. Jerry's contribution to the real estate appraisal community and the Appraisal Institute was tremendous, but his personal guidance and friendship will be most missed. Jerry inspired a whole generation of New York's real estate professionals with his hard work and achievements. He also was a patient teacher who shared his own vast knowledge of real estate and this city, and in that role enriched our lives. We will miss his stories and his counsel. We extend our deepest sympathy to Jerry's family and share with them warm remembrances always.
