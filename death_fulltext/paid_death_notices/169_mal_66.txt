        KOEPPEL-Alfred J. We would like to express our sadness at the early passing of our friend, Alfred J. Koeppel, a man of honesty, ability, warmth and friendliness. Known to some of us for a half century, the Cohens, Roos', and Carmels, and many others at GVA Williams, are fortunate to have the happy memory of him, and will miss him.
