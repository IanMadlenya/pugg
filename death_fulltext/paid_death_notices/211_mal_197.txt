        TITUS -- Joseph Sylvanus. Physicist of Sudbury, MA. A retired sensor systems engineer, died August 18, 2004 after a series of adverse events. He was 74. Mr. Titus was born in East Haven, CT and raised in Branford, CT. He served in the U.S. Army Air Force from 1947-1951. He graduated from Georgetown University and became a memer of the Physics Honor Society. He settled in Sudbury in 1970. Mr. Titus (Joe) was a major contributor to our nation's defense through inventions in space systems. He was a leader and an innovator, publishing many technical papers and holding many patents, and was a nationally recognized expert in cryogenic infrared optical sensors. Joe was a founder of the New England Research Center (NERC) and Sensor Systems Group (SSG, Inc.). Sensor systems engineering is an interdisciplinary skill - spanning optics, electronics, communications, and computing. Few practitioners of this art have ever achieved the level of performance, even briefly, that Joe was able to sustain throughout his career. A generous and compassionate man, Joe was often referred to as ''the smartest guy I've ever known.'' His many interests included cooking, fishing, boating, reading, tennis, and gardening. He was an avid skier, spending most winters at his second home in Steamboat Springs, CO, where his goal was to ski at least 100 days every year. Husband of Norma Jean (Mulder) Titus, he also leaves behind his five children: Robert W., Elizabeth A., Amy J., James M. and Daniel J. He was very proud of his three grandchildren: Lydia and Dylan Gallagher and Josephine Rawlings. He is also survived by his brother Eugene Titus of Branford, CT.
