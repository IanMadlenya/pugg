        SLIFMAN--Doris. The Board of Trustees, management and staff of the Jewish Home and Hospital Lifecare System deeply mourn the passing of Doris Slifman, adored mother of our president and CEO, Dr. Audrey Weiner, and her sister Sheree Green. Family was the most important part of their mother's life and she will be greatly missed. Dr. Weiner's remarkable dedication to the care of the aging is well-known and respected throughout the healthcare field. In her 12 years at the Jewish Home, Audrey has served as executive vice president/COO of the System's 3 nursing home divisions and previously as the senior vice president/COO of the Westchester division, Sarah Neuman Center for Healthcare & Rehabilitation. She assumed the presidency of the Jewish Home and Hospital Lifecare System in 2002. Dr. Weiner and her husband, Dr. Jeffrey Solomon, former COO of UJA-Federation, are leaders in New York's Jewish community and their range of philanthropic endeavors have had global impact. To Audrey and Jeff, Sheree and Joel, their families and the entire Slifman family, we extend our sincerest sympathies. Our thoughts will be with you in your time of loss. Fred M. Lowenfels, Chairman Gene D. Resnick, MD, Vice-Chair Jewish Home and Hospital Lifecare System
