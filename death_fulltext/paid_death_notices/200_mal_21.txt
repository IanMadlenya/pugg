        SILBERMAN--Sidney J. Kaye Scholer LLP mourns the loss of Sidney J. Silberman, our colleague and partner from 1952 until his retirement in 1992. Mr. Silberman made invaluable contributions to Kaye Scholer as its Chairman. As head of the Corporate Department as well as an accomplished tax and estates lawyer, he set an example of excellence for the entire firm. He served as Chairman of the Lawyers Division of UJA, president of the Associated YM-YWHAs of Greater New York, and endowed scholarships at Columbia University from whose law school and college he graduated. Mr. Silberman, an accomplished lawyer, a World War II veteran and a friend, will be missed. We extend our sympathies to his dear daughter and son-in-law, Judy and Cantor Uri Aqua, his grandchildren Daniel, Talia and Adam, and his companion Helene Fagin.
