        $(6$)BLOCK--Leroy. One of the sweetest men to ever walk the face of the earth. Beloved friend and mentor from our first meeting in 1973, to being my dinner date on June 10, 1980, the night I met my future wife of 25 years, Hazel. Most intelligent and very different from all others. Most kind and caring. Never forgetting important occasions. You'll be dearly missed but in our hearts forever. All your friends already miss you. Love, Marvin and Hazel Shanken
