        CARO-Herman. The officers and employees of Hugo Neu Corporation and the John L. Neu Family are deeply saddened by the passing of Dr. Herman Caro, a former senior executive and director of the company and an advisor to the late Hugo Neu. Dr. Caro served the company for more than half a century and his brilliant mind and strong sense of moral conduct helped the company to establish and maintain an important position in the international business community. We extend condolences to his dear wife, Kate, with whom we have been fortunate to share such a long and close relationship, and the family. John L. Neu, CEO
