        GILDER -- Britt - Marie. On January 1, after a battle with throat cancer and emphysema. Born Britt-Marie Lagerljung to Eddy Ljungren and Erik Adam Larsson in Stockhom in 1929, Mrs. Gilder earned prizes in English and German at her Swedish Gymnasium. She emigrated to the United States in 1951, becoming an American citizen in 1955. That year, she married Richard Gilder, raising four children with him. They were divorced in 1970. A woman of unbendable loyalties, Mrs. Gilder adored her adopted country, and showed the same unabating gusto for her family and close friends. After her marriage ended, she returned to education, winning a BA degree in Politcal Science (Cum Laude) from Fordham University in 1988. She advocated feminist causes, traveled the world (often with a grandchild in tow), sewed, quilted and was a seamstress extraordinaire. Possessing a keen eye for true artistic genius, she had a special appreciation of the work of Scandinavian painters, particularly that of the Swedish members of the Matisse school, Isaac Grunewald and Sigrid Hjerten, and of the Norwegian, Christian Krohg. She used her intellect, wiles and wits with us all, wielding them to particularly satisfying effect in her dealings with bureaucracy. Courageous, defiant, outspoken, original, and unendingly generous to those she loved, she left her mark of elan wherever she went. She is survived by her four children, former husband, sister, brother, seven grandchildren, niece and seven nephews. Please send donations to ProEnglish (www.ProEnglish.org) or Planned Parenthood (www.plannedparenthood .org). Family is receiving at Frank E. Campbell, on January 11, 7-9 PM. Memorial service will take place on January 12, 3 PM, at Beth-el Chapel at Temple Emanu-el.
