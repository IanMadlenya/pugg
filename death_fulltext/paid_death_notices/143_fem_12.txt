        VALENSTEIN-Katrina Ely Burlingham. We deeply grieve the passing of Tinky, beloved wife of Arthur F. Valenstein, devoted mother of David Valenstein and Anne Heller, and affectionate grandmother of Toby, Ella, and Daniel. Born on March 27, 1919 in NYC. Daughter of Dorothy Tiffany Burlingham and Robert Burlingham, and sister of Michael Burlingham. Died on November 28, 1998 in Cambridge after a long illness. A memorial gathering will be held at a later date. We will sorely miss her kindness and her love of life.
