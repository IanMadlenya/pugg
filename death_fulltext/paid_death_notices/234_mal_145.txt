        FERBER--Arnold. Wow, what a life. A life of generosity, of adventure and exploration, of challenge and triumph and steadfast determination. Arnold was born in New York on October 29, 1920, the only child of Beatrice and Irving Feinberg. He graduated CCNY at 19, then joined the Army to serve his country in World War II. A shy young man, Arnold's magnetic personality and charisma began to emerge in his late 20's. First, an entrepreneur, then a world traveler, he circled the globe with Zelda, his wife of 57 years. And, late in life, Arnold found another love in Jackie, with whom he shared a deep sense that we are all here to nurture one another. Arnold died on July 11, 2006, leaving behind a rich legacy of love, and dedication to the principle that life is to be lived, to the fullest. Services will be held Friday, July 14, at 11:30 AM at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76 St.
