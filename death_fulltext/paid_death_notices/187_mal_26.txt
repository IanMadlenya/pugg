        GOLDMAN-Rev. Ezra. Our temple family deeply mourns the loss of our beloved friend. He served our temple as Ritual Director for more than 25 years. We were blessed to have him share with us his mastery of synagogue Nusach and rituals, gained from years of study in the Yeshivot of prewar Poland. We shall sorely miss his sense of humor, his store of anecdotes, his sweet disposition and gentle manner. We extend our deepest condolences to his son Lloyd and brother Manny. Funeral services will be held on Sunday morning August 4, at 10:15 A.M. at Temple Gates of Prayer, 3820 Parsons Blvd, Flushing. Temple Gates of Prayer Albert Thaler, Rabbi Susan E.
