        SANDOR--Gyorgy. The Juilliard School is deeply saddened by the death of Gyorgy Sandor, one of the great pianists and teachers of our time. A member of The Juilliard School faculty since 1982, he championed contemporary composers and was a major figure in the profession as a teacher and a judge in various international piano competitions. His artistry and personal sophistication made him a respected colleague and good friend to all who knew him. We send our condolences to his entire family. Joseph W. Polisi, President
