        HARRIMAN-Pamela. The Rockefeller University community deeply mourns the loss of its beloved friend Pamela Harriman. An esteemed member of The Rockefeller University Council from 1977 to 1979, and of the Board of Trustees from 1979 to 1993, she will be remembered for her wise counsel and devoted participation in the life of the University. During her 16-year association with the University, Mrs. Harriman introduced the work of its scientists to new constituencies in both New York and Washington, DC. Her keen insight, good judgment and remarkable energy will be greatly missed. We extend our deepest condolences to her son, Winston S. Churchill II, and her entire family. Torsten N. Wiesel, President Richard M. Furlaud, Chairman Board of Trustees, and David Rockefeller, Honorary Chairman, Board of Trustees and Chairman, The Rockefeller University Council
