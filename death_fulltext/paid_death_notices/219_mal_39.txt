        WOJTYLA--Karol Jozef. The Members, Board of Trustees, and the Rabbis of Congregation Emanu-El of the City of New York join with all of God's children in mourning the passing of His Holiness Pope John Paul II. May the Holy One remember him for his unique relationship to the Jewish people and for his sensitivity to the traditions of Judaism, rooted in his expriences as a child of Poland, as he grew up in the midst of one of the greatest of all historic Jewish communities. The bonds that he forged with our people during the Second World War brought to him an understanding of the religious, historic, and cultural authenticity of the Jewish world and its people. His life was dedicated to the teaching of the prophet Malachi: ''Have we not all one Father? Hath not one God created us all?'' May his soul be bound up in the bond of eternal life. Rabbi David M. Posner Robert A. Bernhard, Pres Herbert C. Bernard, Secy
