        ZELLER-Belle. The Hunter College Community mourns the loss of Belle Zeller, a 1921 graduate of Hunter College High School, and 3 years later, a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Hunter College. She was a professor of political science for 47 years, and was a mentor and counselor to many legislative leaders. Her books analyzing lobbying and state legislatures made her a national authority on governmental operations. She was also a leader in the fight to win collective bargaining rights for CUNY faculty and served as head of the Professional Staff Congress, City University's Union, for 32 years. In recognition of her many years of dedicated service to the city and the nation and her lifelong advocacy for CUNY students, she was awarded the President's Medal of Hunter College in 1994. David A. Caputo, President Hunter College
