        FALVO d'URSO-Giacinta La Ferla, of Lamezia Terme, Italy, on Saturday, December 4, 1999. Devoted wife of Renato. Wonderful mother of Marina and Dr. Paul Gusmorino, Ivan, Danilo, Rosetta, Francesco, Anna Falvo d'Urso, Rossella and Pino Mercuri. Adoring grandmother of Paul and Sabrina Gusmorino and Antonio Mercuri. She brightened the lives of many. We will miss her warm and gentle heart, her courage, generosity, dignity, inner strength, intellect, and optimism. She was a real paragon of beauty and virtue.
