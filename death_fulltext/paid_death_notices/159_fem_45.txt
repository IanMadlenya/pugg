        LESTER-UN-Esther. We deeply mourn the sudden passing of our devoted wife, mother and grandmother, on April 4, 2000. She will be remembered for her grace, charm, generosity & loving spirit. Her artistic nature lives on in her children, Todd and Dana, and her grandchildren, Simone, Mimi, Marlon and Jack. Her husband Andy will be sustained by the memory and depth of their love. She will be sorely missed.
