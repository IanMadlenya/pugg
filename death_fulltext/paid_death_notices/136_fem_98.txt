        KAFIN-Bonnie Deborah. November 1, 1947-May 3, 1998. At home in Coconut Creek, FL. Formerly of Philadelphia. Beloved daughter of Ann and Jacob, sister of Robert & William, aunt to Tammy, Peter, Philip, Joshua, and Sabrina. Her love of music, nature, literature, and caring for others will always be remembered. She was an avid observer of life and its meanings, and maintained a daily journal for 20 years. Her diaries reflect a passion for knowledge, insight, spirit and wisdom. We were blessed to know a gifted and poetic soul who lived life to the fullest, in her unique way, and who died, too soon, with promises unkept. It is an unbearable sadness for those of us who love her, and we will always cherish her for who she was.
