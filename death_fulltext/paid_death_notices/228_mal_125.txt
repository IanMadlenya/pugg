        HIMMELFARB--Milton. The American Jewish Committee is deeply sorrowed by the passing of Milton Himmelfarb. During a distinguished 44 year career at AJC, he served in virtually every department of the national organization, including as editor of the American Jewish Year Book and as contributing editor to Commentary Magazine. He was Director of Information and Research Services from 1968 to his retirement in January, 1986. A distinguished intellectual and proud Jew, he will be sorely missed by all who knew him. We extend our sympathies to his wife, Judith, seven children, and their families. E. Robert Goodkind, Pres. David A. Harris, Exec Dir. Shula Bahat, Assoc Exec Dir
