        AVERY-David Wainwright. On May 18, 2000 of Essex, CT died after a short illness. He was 83 years old. A tall man with a big heart, he was devoted to his family and his church and was blessed with the gifts of song and laughter. Dave Avery was born on his family's farm in Aurora, NY on December 17, 1916. He graduated from Cayuga Lake Academy and Syracuse University. Early on he chose to work in advertising and spent most of his career with the National Geographic Magazine in New York, retiring in 1983 to Riverside and Essex, CT. He was a member of the University Glee Club of New York, an Elder and Deacon of the Rye Presbyterian Church in Rye, NY, a founding member of the Rye Walking, Chowder and Poker Society and a long-time member of the Manursing Island Club in Rye. Although at home in corporate offices along Madison Avenue, he was molded by his early years in Aurora, NY. His easy, open manner, his generosity, sense of humor and pride made him a successful salesman, a loving husband, dedicated father and joyful relative. The farm never left him, as his success in nurturing tomatoes, radishes and scallions out of the most unpromising ground in suburban New York attests. He is survived by his wife of 25 years, Irene Avery of Essex, CT, his children by a previous marriage, William of New Canaan, CT, David Jr. of Stamford, CT, Thomas of Oakland, CA, Chris of Royaton, CT and Carol of New York City, his step-daughters Elizabeth Bagley of New Canaan and Sue Howland of Chicago, his sister Jean Wagner of Hampton Falls, NH, his brother Baldwin of Pocono Lake Preserve, PA., and seven grandchildren. Services will be held at The First Congregational Church in Old Lyme, CT on June 6, 2000.
