        SELLIN-GREHER-Sarah L. Our beloved and inspiring high school history teacher who left an indelible imprint on the lives of so many of us. Sarah Sellin-Greher, a woman of great wit, intelligence, and integrity was a teacher par excellence. She taught us to be aware, to read between the lines and to forever seek the truth by asking critical questions. Since we first shared a double desk at Taft High School, we have cherished her friendship throughout the years. Our condolences to her family and all whose lives she touched.
