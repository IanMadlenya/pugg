        FANTA--Eugene, M.D. His friends and colleagues at Lutheran Medical Center mourn the loss of Dr. Eugene Fanta. Dr. Fanta was affiliated with Lutheran for more than 60 years. He served as Director of Emergency Medicine for several years and was responsible for the creation of Lutheran's Family Practice Residency Program, the first in New York City. Prior to his retirement, this much beloved physician was honored at the White House as Family Doctor of the Year. He later served as a trustee of the medical center and was named Director Emeritus of Family Practice. We offer our heartfelt condolences to his wife Charlotte, his sons and their families. Dr Fanta's intelligence, compassion and generosity of spirit will be missed by all who knew him. Howard Smith, Chairman Board of Trustees Wendy Z.
