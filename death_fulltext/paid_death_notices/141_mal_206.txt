        MACHLIS-Joseph. The entire Queens College community mourns the death of our beloved professor of the joys of music, Joseph Machlis, who gave thousands a lifelong appreciation of the art of beautiful listening during his thirtyfive years as a teacher at the College. His generous heart and brilliance in creative expression enthralled all who met him or read his words in textbooks or novels. He remained a member of the College family after his retirement. It was a thrilling moment in our history when we were able to award him an honorary degree as a special convocation on the occasion of his ninetieth birthday, with so many of those he befriended present and able to shower their love on him. He was an irreplaceable human being, unique in his wit and warmth and ability to share his feelings and his devotion to the great art of music. We will never forget him. Allen Lee Sessoms, President Queens College
