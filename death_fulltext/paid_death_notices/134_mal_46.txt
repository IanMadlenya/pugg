        SOBEL-Rabbi Pesach. We record with sorrow the passing of our beloved colleague. He served as educator in congregations in Cincinnati, OH and Spring Valley, NY. At the time of his death he was a teacher at the Prozdor of Boston Hebrew College and Rabbi of the South Area Solomon Schechter Day School in Stoughton, MA. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Suzanne, children Uri, Ilana, and Shira Mercado, and to his sister, Edith, and to his brotherin-law, our colleague, Rabbi Harold (Suzette) Kushner.
