        CURNEN-Edward C., Jr., M.D. The Department of Pediatrics of the Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons and the Alumni Association of Babies & Children's Hospital of New York pay tribute to their esteemed and beloved colleague who died on December 1, 1997, at 88 years of age in Woodbridge, CT. After serving as the first chairman of Pediatrics at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, Dr. Curnen joined the faculty at Columbia in 1960 as Carpentier Professor of Pediatrics and Chairman of the Department in which post he served until 1970. In addition to his research in infectious diseases, Dr. Curnen was a consummate pediatrician who manifested in his teaching and the care of children infinite wisdom, sensitivity and grace. After his retirement in 1974, the Edward C. Curnen, Jr., Award was established by his colleagues to be presented annually at the Alumni Association meeting to honor that house officer who best exemplified the ideas of humane and compassionate care that Dr. Curnen so manifestly displayed during his long distinguished career.
