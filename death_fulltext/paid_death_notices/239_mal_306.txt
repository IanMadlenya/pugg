        BARBER--Hugh R.K., MD. The Board of Trustees, the Medical Staff and the entire Lenox Hill Hospital family mourn the loss of our esteemed colleague. A distinguished physician, educator, scholar and advocate for women's health care, Dr. Barber was internationally renowned for his seminal work in ovarian cancer. He began his impressive career in 1944 as a resident at Lenox Hill Hospital, and was appointed Chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology in 1963, a position he held with distinction until 1997. Respected by his colleagues as a consummate physician and sophisticated intellect, and revered by young physicians as a teacher and mentor, he was a leader in the field of gynecologic malignant disease. Author of hundreds of scientific journal articles and 20 books, Dr. Barber lectured extensively, and was a founding member of the New York Gynecological Society. In 2000, in recognition of Dr. Barber's exceptional accomplishments and devoted service, Lenox Hill Hospital inaugurated an endowed chair in his name. Dr. Barber will be long remembered by all who knew him. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Mary Louise. William O.
