        FEIG - Werner. Werner Feig changed the way his students saw the world. He challenged assumptions with humor and boldness, connected history with the politics of the present, and brought intellectual sophistication to the high school classroom. He was an extraordinary teacher, a rare inspiration, and a loyal mentor to his many proteges. Hilary Ballon
