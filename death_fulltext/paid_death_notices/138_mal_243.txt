        RUBIDGE-Bradley. The Deans, faculty, students, and staff of New York University, and the Department of French deeply mourn the passing of our colleague, Bradley Rubidge. He was a scholar of French and Comparative Literatures specializing in the cultural and intellectual history, theater, and literature of the 17th Century. Dr. Rubidge died in New York City on July 20. He taught at NYU since 1994 and was Assistant Professor of French at the time of his death. He was admired by his colleagues and his students for his warmth, his erudition, and his commitment to scholarship and teaching. He made important contributions to neoclassical studies and will be deeply missed by all who had contact with him. Professor Rubidge is survived by his wife, Jane Real Rubidge, his parents, David and Nell Rubidge, his brother William Rubidge, and his sister, Cindy Sweeney. The funeral will be held at All Souls Unitarian Church at Lexington Avenue and 80th Street on Saturday, July 25, at 11:00 a.m.; the family asks that no flowers be sent. A memorial service will be held at NYU at a later date.
