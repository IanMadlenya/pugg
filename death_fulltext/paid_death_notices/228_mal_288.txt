        COUPER--Richard W. The Trustees and staff of the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation are deeply saddened by the death of Richard W. Couper, President Emeritus and Trustee Emeritus of the Foundation. A wonderfully creative and effective leader, Mr. Couper brought new vigor to the Foundation's work in graduate education and the humanities during his nearly nine years as President (198190). He also developed new Foundation programs in public policy and the professional development of teachers, efforts that remain central to the Foundation's work today. Mr. Couper raised the Foundation's public profile, introduced it to new supporters, and oversaw its first capital campaign. To the end of his life, he remained a great and generous friend of the Foundation and a continuing inspiration to its leaders. The Woodrow Wilson Board of Trustees and the Foundation staff extend heartfelt condolences and deepest sympathies to Dick's wife, Patsy, and to their family. Nancy Weiss Malkiel, Chair and the Board of Trustees The Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, Princeton, N.J.
        $(6$)COUPER--Richard W. The Hamilton College community mourns the passing of loyal and beloved alumnus, former vice president, acting president, provost and life trustee Dick Couper. A warm and learned man, he loved language and he loved books, as his presidencies of the New York Public Library and The Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation attest. His death is an immense loss for Hamilton, for his family and for his many friends throughout academia and beyond. Joan Hinde Stewart President, Hamilton College
