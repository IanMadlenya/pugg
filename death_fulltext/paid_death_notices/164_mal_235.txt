        WHYTE-Donald. The New York Philharmonic notes with grief and sadness the death of Donald Whyte, a deeply valued member of the Philharmonic's violin section since 1972. Mr. Whyte's early teachers were Alexander Whyte and Elman Lowe. Prior to joining the Orchestra, Mr. Whyte attended the University of Saskatchewan and Indiana University, where he studied with Josef Gingold. After joining the Philharmonic, he continued his studies with Ivan Galamian and became an active chamber musician, playing with the Gofriller Quartet and the Soho Ensemble. Mr. Whyte was an influential member of various Philharmonic orchestra committees, most recently serving as chairman of the Artistic Committee for several years. He also served as a Philharmonic representative to the International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians and was a board member of the Music Assistance Fund, which aids young minority musicians. In addition, Donald Whyte was a successful heart transplant recipient. His love of music and dedication to the Orchestra and fellow musicians will long be remembered. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Noriko, and to his entire family. Kurt Masur, Music Director Members of the Orchestra Paul B. Guenther, Chairman Zarin Mehta, Executive Director
