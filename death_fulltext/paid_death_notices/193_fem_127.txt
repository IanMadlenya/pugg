Beloved mother of Esther and Hal Pollock, Yitzchak Goldfield, Rita and Sy Rotter, and Ruth and Sheldon Kriegel. Dear sister of Clara Rongil and the late Josef Halpern. Cherished grandmother, great-grandmother and aunt. Born in Poland in 1907, she grew up in Holland and settled in Belgium. Armed with courage and foresight, she rescued herself, her husband, and her two young children from Hitler's Holocaust. A true eshet chayil, she was untiring in her lifelong support of the Zionist movement, the State of Israel and of the Jewish people. Hadassah was her passion and she gave to that organization energy, time, and her vast knowledge of Judaica during five decades. She was unique: wise, witty, insightful, charming, generous and loving; and a role model and inspiration to her family and to all who knew her.
