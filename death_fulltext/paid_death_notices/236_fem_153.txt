        SCHMELTZER--Gertrude. The Talmud teaches us that it is possible for one to die without sin and for the living to mourn without guilt. The Officers, Board of Trustees and staff of American Friends of Magen David Adom-ARMDI mourn the passing of Gertrude Schmeltzer at the age of 96. Gertrude was President of the Riverdale AFMDA Chapter and a pillar of the organization for more than 50 years. A true woman of valor, no task was too small or too daunting for her. Although she had no children, she was a second mother and grandmother to her niece, Madelon RosenSolomon, husband Larry & children Samantha & Philip. The family requests that donations in Gertrude's memory be made to ''American Friends of Magen David Adom'', 888 7th Ave, #
