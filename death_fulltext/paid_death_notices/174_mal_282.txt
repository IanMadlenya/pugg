        RIVELIS-Marcos, M.D. The Board of Trustees, Administration and Medical Staff of the Hospital for Special Surgery mourn with profound sorrow the passing of Marcos Rivelis, M.D. As a highly respected colleague and member of the medical staff at the Hospital for Special Surgery since 1966, he consistantly provided the highest level of medical care along with deep compassion and an intuitive knowledge of his patients. Dr. Rivelis was a strong supporter of the hospital and founded our own International Center, serving as its chairman for many years, greatly contributing to its growth and distinguished reputation. He was much admired for his medical expertise and his contributions to rheumatologic medicine throughout his career. He will be greatly missed and remembered always. We extend our prayerful condolences to his wife, Ema, and the entire Rivelis family. Richard L. Menschel, Chairman Aldo Papone, Co-Chairman Board of Trustees John R. Reynolds, President and CEO Russell F. Warren, M.D. Surgeon-in-Chief Stephen A. Paget, M.D. Physician-in-Chief
