        ZUNZ--Sylvia. We mourn the passing of Sylvia Zunz, beloved wife of 58 years of Lyonel Zunz, esteemed and distinguished Chairman of the Board of Trustees of The Community School, who has offered unmatched and dedicated leadership to New Jersey's and New York's learning disabled children for nearly four decades. Standing beside Lyonel for the past 35 years, Sylvia helped nurture the growth of The Community School, positively shaping the lives of thousands of children. Sylvia's constant support helped to create The Community School ''family'' and gave real opportunity to our children where none otherwise existed. She will be dearly missed by all of us at The Community School. Our heartfelt sympathy goes out to Lyonel, Sharyn and Gail. Sylvia's memory will continue to brighten our lives.
