        REESE-William W.. New York City Ballet is saddened by the loss of our dear friend William Reese. He was a longtime member of our Board of Directors and our International Committee, and devoted his considerable talent and energy to the development of the Guild in its formative years, ensuring ongoing support for the Company he so loved. We extend our deepest sympathy to his family.
