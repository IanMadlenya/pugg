        SEDLEY--Nathan. The officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the loss of Nathan Sedley, a renowned businessman and leader of the Jewish community. Nathan's lifetime of support for humanitarian causes served as the foundation for the Sedley family's commitment to philanthropic concerns. This enduring legacy continues through the leadership of Nathan's son, Ronald, whose service to our Board of Directors and Commission on the Jewish People strengthens our ability to serve those in need. Ronald's generosity and enthusiasm overflows with the spirit of klal Yisrael, positively influencing the global Jewish community. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Nathan's beloved wife, Dina; to their children: Ronald, Rita Katz, Brenda Beeley, Madeline, and her husband, Leo Zern; to their grandchildren and great-grandchildren; and to the entire family. Morris W. Offit, President Susan K. Stern, Chair of the Board John S. Ruskay, Exec. V.P. & C.E.O.
