        GAON--Brian. Friend and teammate. One of the really ''good guys.'' Always there with the practical jokes, infectious laugh, secret smile, and open heart. God finally has a left wing to put the puck in the net. Hopefully the ''Rocket'' will get him to back-check. You've left a hole in our hearts. Marci & Brian S. Waterman
