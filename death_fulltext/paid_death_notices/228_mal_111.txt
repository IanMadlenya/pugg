        FRIEDMAN--Clifford. Brooklyn College and the Brooklyn College Foundation deeply mourn the passing of Clifford Friedman, Class of 1948, whose affection for and loyalty to his alma mater was unrivaled. His generosity over decades provided important opportunities for numerous students who otherwise would not have had access to quality higher education. Our heartfelt condolences are extended to his wife Frances and his family. Christoph M. Kimmich, President Brooklyn College Marjorie Magner Chairman Brooklyn College Foundation
