        ALBRECHT-CARRIE--Else Lorch (December 23, 1915 February 13, 2007). Of an adventuresome Viking spirit, Else graced Columbia University and the New World with her deep sense of culture, her courage, integrity and loyalty. A linguistic polyglot, she served as editor and translator for many years at New Directions Publishing. She gave passionately, generously and with infinite patience to those honored by her love. As she joins her beloved husband, Rene, she will be sorely missed by her children, Duncan, Madeleine and Ingrid, and her grandchildren, Dylan and Malcolm.
