        HACKETT--Buddy. The Officers, Governors and Members of the New York Friars Club deeply mourn the loss of their beloved and esteemed member, and Honorary Officer, Buddy Hackett. Buddy was a consummate court jester who gave the gift of laughter. He was a master craftsman of humor who brought the Friar's Club to hilarious heights during his Roast & Dinner appearances. His humor and love of life will be sorely missed by all the Friars. We are honored and proud to have been touched by the comedy legend that will always be Buddy Hackett. Alan King, Abbot Freddie Roman, Dean Jean-Pierre Trebot, Executive Director >>AD#
