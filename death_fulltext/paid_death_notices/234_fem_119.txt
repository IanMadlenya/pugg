        PONCE DE LEON--Susan. New York City's affordable housing community mourns the passing of our colleague and friend, Susan Ponce de Leon, Assistant Commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. During her twenty years of dedicated service, she crafted preservation and new construction programs for small homes and large-scale developments. Her integrity, intelligence, and humor will be sorely missed. We extend our deepest sympathies to Susan's husband Ignacio; children Gabe and Alexandra; mother Edith Goldner; and sister Debra Goldner.
