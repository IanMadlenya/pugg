        PORTO-Daisy M. Our mother's valiant struggle against lung cancer came to a peaceful end on November 29, 2000. To her children Emilie O'Sullivan and Ben E. Porto, she bequeaths a legacy of a passionate love of life and a commitment never to acknowledge the threat of defeat. To the treasures of her life, grandsons Brad and Ryan O'Sullivan and Joseph and Brian Porto, she imparts endless love and affection. The boys will always cherish her stirring example of courage that belied her petite stature. It is a very difficult void to fill, but her show of consistent strength and grace in the face of great adversity will give them an abundance of enduring and inspirational memories. She leaves behind a sister, Gloria Bianchi, her daughter-in-law Jean Anne Celebrezze Porto and her grandson Joseph's wife, Annie Thompson Porto. As a family we find consolation in her reunion with her beloved husband, Joe. She will now realize all the happiness she gave to so many others. Under the watchful eye of Dr. Mark Kris, her life was extended with quality. Please make contributions in her memory to Lung Cancer Research Fund, #
