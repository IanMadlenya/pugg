        KOHTIO-August G., MD. The New York Eye and Ear Infirmary notes with sorrow the passing of a well respected member of its medical staff. Affiliated with the hospital as an Ophthalmologist and Ophthalmic Pathologist since 1958, Dr. Kohtio was a stalwart supporter of the Infirmary and the Ophthalmology Education Program. He will long be remembered by those who profited from his devotion. Our sincerest condolences to his wife Vita and their entire family. Robert C. Della Rocca, MD Chairman, Medical Board Joseph B. Walsh, MD Chairman Dept of Ophthalmology
