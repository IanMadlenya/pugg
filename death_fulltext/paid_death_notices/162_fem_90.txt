        VLOCK-Laurel F. The staff and management of the National Jewish Television Network express profound sorrow at the tragic loss of our longtime colleague and cofounder, Laurel F. Vlock. For more than 15 years Laurel graced our airways with wit and charm, using her extraordinary skills to interview presidents and prime ministers, survivors of the Holocaust, and leading lights of the Jewish world everywhere. In 1981 she coanchored, with David Schoenbrun, our live coverage from Jerusalem of the World Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors, also carried on the PBS network and nominated for a national Emmy Award. May the wonderful legacy Laurel leaves behind be a source of comfort to her friends and family in this time of profound bereavement. Joel A. Levitch, President Aaron Etra, Chairman Executive Committee
