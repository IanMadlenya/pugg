        SCHORR-Rabbi Israel. On March 31. Beloved father of his daughter Gail and son-in-law Dr. Lawrence Horowitz. He was the revered rabbi of Congregation Beth El-Young Israel of Boro Park for 60 years and past president of Hapoel Hamizrachi. A rabbinic scholar with an insatiable love of learning, keen intellect coupled with kindness, humor and tenderness. He was a true renaissance man who will be sorely missed by his family and all who were privileged to know him. He left a void that can never be filled. The Horowitz Family
