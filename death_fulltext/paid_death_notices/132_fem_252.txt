        SWANSON-Susan. All of us at John Wiley & Sons, Inc., mourn the loss of Susan Swanson, Director of Journal Subscription and Fulfillment, and wife of Eric Swanson, Senior V.P., STM Publishing. Susan was well-known for her business knowledge and savvy, her contributions to industry efforts, and her charm and humor. We will miss her terribly. Our deepest condolences to Eric, her daughter Jessica, and their families and friends.
