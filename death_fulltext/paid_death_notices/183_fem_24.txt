        HAYNES-Jean Reed. The American Judicature Society celebrates the tragically shortened life of this remarkable woman, our first female president, whose intelligence, wit, generosity, and drive have supported and inspired our mission to promote the effective administration of justice. A born leader, a wonderful friend, a delightful and vibrant lady, the AJS family will miss her always. Deirdre O'Meara Smith, President Justice Miriam Shearing, Chair E. Barrett Prettyman Jr, Vice-Chair Allan D. Sobel, Exec. Dir. American Judicature Society
