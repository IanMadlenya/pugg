        HEPBURN--Katharine. With the death of Katharine Hepburn, the world has lost one of the most original actors of all time. It also has lost a woman who was as forceful off screen as she was on. Hepburn was a member of the PPFA Board of Advocates and Honorary Chair of the PPFA National Leadership Committee to Keep Abortion Safe and Legal. Her mother was an ardent suffragist who worked with Margaret Sanger. Speaking of Sanger in 1981, Hepburn said, ''it is imperative that I join Planned Parenthood because sadly even today there are those who would completely destroy all of her tireless work and deprive all of us of our right to plan our families''. Twenty years later, with the president and Congress waging a war on women's rights, we need voices like Katharine Hepburn's more than ever. We send our heartfelt sympathies to her family and friends. La Don Love, Chairperson Gloria Feldt, President Planned Parenthood Federation of America >>AD#
