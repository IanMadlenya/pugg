        TILLES--Norman. The Officers, Board of Directors and staff of The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) mourn the passing of our esteemed, long-time Board member, Norman Tilles, whose steadfast support for JDC's efforts attests to his abiding concern for humanitarian needs and the welfare of Jewish communities around the globe. He served his home community of Providence as President of the Jewish Federation of Rhode Island, and he worked selflessly on behalf of those in need of refuge as Board President of HIAS (the Hebrew Immigrant Aide Society). We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Florence and to the entire Tilles family. May his memory be for a blessing. Judge Ellen M. Heller, President Eugene J. Ribakoff, Chairman of the Board Steven Schwager, Executive Vice President
