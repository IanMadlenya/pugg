        ROSENBERG--Arnold Lionel, died November 6th at 92. Received a law degree but his real love and aptitude was mathematics. He successfully managed production at standard motor products by mentally tracking the entire product line before computers became available. He also applied his exceptional math skills to the stock market and contract bridge. More over, numbers led him to meet his wife and true love of 66 years, Sylvia, in a graduate accounting class. His warmth, humor, generosity, playfulness, always positive outlook, and openness to everyone will be deeply missed by his wife, sister Myra, two children Janet and Richard, five grandchildren, two great grandchildren, and by all those who knew him. Services at Riverside-Nassau North Chapel, 55 North Station Plaza, Great Neck, November 8th at 10AM.
