        SALTEN--David G. Hofstra University is profoundly saddened by the death of David G. Salten, consultant to the president. A generous and dedicated member of the Hofstra community, Dr. Salten was a longtime supporter of Hofstra University, including the annual Shakespeare festival and the Hofstra arboretum, and was generous with his time and counsel to Hofstra's president as well as numerous academic programs at Hofstra University. Dr. Salten also served as an active member of Hofstra University's Joan and Arnold Saltzman Community Services Center Advisory Board since the Center's inception in 1991. Known for his groundbreaking career in education, as well as his exemplary service to Nassau County's economic development initiatives, Dr. Salten held a Ph.D. and four honorary doctorates in letters, laws and sciences, including an L.H.D. from Hofstra University in 1996. He was also named an honorary Hofstra alumnus in 2001. He is survived by his wife, Adrienne O'Brien, his daughters, Phoebe, Cynthia and Melissa, eight grandchildren, and ten great-grandchildren. In tribute to Dr. Salten, all Hofstra University flags have been lowered to half staff. A memorial celebration will be held at Hofstra University in November 2006. John D. Miller Chair, Board of Trustees Stuart Rabinowitz, President Hofstra University
