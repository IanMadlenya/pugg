        COX--Donald M. Trustees, Fellows, and staff of the American Academy in Rome mourn the loss of a beloved friend, Trustee (1983-2003), Trustee Emeritus (2003 onward) and inspired Chair of the Finance committee. His tender guidance, generosity, wisdom, and deep commitment to the institution, artists, and the visual arts will long be felt. Don and Maria established an artist's Studio and History of Art Rome Prize that every year provides a transformative experience to an American, a cherished legacy. We extend our deepest condolences to Maria and the family. David M.
