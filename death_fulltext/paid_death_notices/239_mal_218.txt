        $(6$)STONE--Allan. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to the family of Allan Stone, his wife Clare and his six daughters, Allison, Claudia, Jeremy, Heather, Posy and Jessie, and to their partners and children. Allan was a Renaissance man. He had an interest in so many things -just being with him was a delight. We always felt like we caught his passion and energy, and always learned something new. We enjoyed everything more when we were with Clare and Allan. His garden in Maine, chocolate sundaes, tennis, his ability to recognize fake Klines, Gorkys, and de Koonings, his love of Gaudi, as well as his magnificent African fetish figures. He fascinated our eyes as well as our minds. Its very difficult for us to think of a world without Allan. He was always generous with his time and his interest in trying to better the lives of others. He certainly made our lives richer and fuller. The six cakes of Thiebaud will always remind me of the mutual love we had of sweets. Agnes Gund and Daniel Shapiro
