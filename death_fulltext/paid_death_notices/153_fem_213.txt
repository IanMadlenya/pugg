        WOLFF-Barbara. The New York City BID Managers' Association, representing New York's 41 business improvement districts, notes with sadness the death of Barbara Wolff, our dear colleague, mentor and friend. For more than 20 years, Barbara provided extraordinary leadership and guidance to large and small business improvement districts throughout New York City. Each of the organizations that we represent embodies Barbara's passionate commitment to the neighborhoods and downtowns of New York City. The breadth, diversity and strength of our programs is a tribute to her vision, wisdom and dedication. She will be greatly missed by all of us who were privileged to work with her. We extend our sincere condolences to her family. Monica Blum, Chairperson BID Managers' Association
