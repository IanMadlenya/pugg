        HOPKINS-B Smith, MD. The Dept of Surgery of The Saint Luke'sRoosevelt Hospital Center mourns the passing of B Smith Hopkins, M.D., on July 29, 2001. Dr. Hopkins graduated from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1975 and completed his general surgery training at Saint Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in 1980. After Fellowship Training in surgical metabolism, he joined the surgical faculty in 1981. He will be remembered as an exacting and caring surgeon, a role model and mentor to the Surgical House Staff, and a highly respected and revered colleague of both the surgical and medical faculty. He was a genuine friend to patients, fellow physicians, hospital staff, and adminstration. His wit, wisdom and good humor will be missed by the entire hospital family. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Alice, and sons, Daniel and Benjamin. George J. Todd, M.D., Chairman Richard A. Marks, M.D., Vice Chairman
