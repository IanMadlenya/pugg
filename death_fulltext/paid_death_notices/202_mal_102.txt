        KLEINERMAN--Joseph. The Board of Directors of New York Road Runners mourn the passing of our beloved fellow member. Known to thousands as ''Coach'', Joe was one of the founders of New York Road Runners, a man who devoted his life to the sport of running. As a youth, he was an exceptional athlete of national and international renown. He served in executive posts in national track and field and long distance running organizations and was a strong supporter of women's running, spearheading its integration with men. Joe was also instrumental in initiating now-standard age group categories in running. We will miss you very much, Joe.
