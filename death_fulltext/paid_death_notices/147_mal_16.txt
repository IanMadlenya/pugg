        KANE-Bernard. It is with deep sadness that the Board of Governors and members of Elmwood Country Club record the loss of our esteemed member, Bernard Kane. He and his family have been members of Elmwood for over 30 years. Bernard had a distinguished career in the elevator industry where he was an acknowledged leader. To Barbara, Douglas and Laurie and all the grandchildren, we offer our most sincere condolences. We will greatly miss Bernard's presence at Elmwood. Services at Riverside Memorial Mount Vernon, Friday, April 2 at 12 noon. Ken Goodman, President
