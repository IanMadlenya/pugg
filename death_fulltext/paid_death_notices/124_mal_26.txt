        HOFSTADTER-Newton. Formerly of Forest Hills and Florida. Residing in Ventura, California. We mourn the sudden loss of a lifelong, beloved friend who knew the urgency of friendship. He will be remembered as sportsman and a man who gave of himself. We shall sorely miss him with a memory enduring. Helene and Ron Rosson
