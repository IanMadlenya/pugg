        HAMILTON--Marcia Fuller, (54) died peacefully on May 2, 2007, at Greenwich Hospital with her four beloved daughters and her husband by her side. The dignity, courage and beauty she upheld during her battle with cancer have been an inspiration to us all. Born August 3, 1952, in Coronado, California, she was the youngest of four children born to Ruth and Captain Harold Fuller, USN Retired. She is survived by her three siblings, James Fuller of Orlando, Florida; Richard Fuller of Seattle, Washington; and Laura Fuller Bates of Hythe, England. Marcia spent her early years in Alexandria, Virginia, before moving to New York City. She was a television producer before her marriage to Peter Hamilton in 1982. A woman of great style and taste, Marcia was a world traveler living in Tokyo and London before settling with her family in Greenwich, Connecticut in 1991. Motherhood and family life were Marcia's calling, and nothing brought her greater pleasure than life with her four daughters Katie (23), Betsy (20), Charlotte (18), Lucy (8), and her husband Peter, whom she referred to as her hero during her illness. A gracious and beautiful woman, Marcia had a wonderful sense of warmth and humor that will be greatly missed by all who knew her. She lived her life with high standards that will remain in the hearts of her daughters forever. The Hamilton family would like to thank all of the care givers who attended to Marcia at home, Greenwich Hospital and Memorial Sloan Kettering these past two years and to the extended Greenwich community without whose endless support the family would not have survived. A Requiem Eucharist celebrating her life will be held at 10:30 am on Saturday, May 5, 2007, at Christ Church, 254 East Putnam Avenue, in Greenwich, Connecticut. In lieu of flowers, donations in Marcia's memory may be made to the Oncology Department of Greenwich Hospital or to Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center.
