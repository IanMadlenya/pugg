She was born in Cincinnati, OH on September 26, 1915, the daughter of Dr. Abraham and Ann Eiseman. She arrived in New York City in 1955 where she resided until November 4, 2003 at which time she passed away at Mount Sinai Hospital. Phyllis was devoted to the arts and subscribed to opera, concerts and theater. She was a tournament bridge player in New York City and on shipboard during her many travels abroad. An active alumna of the University of Michigan, she was a strong supporter of their library project. She was interred in the Eiseman family plot in the Clover Hill Park Cemetery, Royal Oak, MI. A memorial service will be held in New York City at a future date. We miss her.
