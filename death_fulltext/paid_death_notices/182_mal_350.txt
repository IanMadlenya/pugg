        GERMAIN-Lawrence. 11th Anniversary I wished upon a star last night I dreamt that it came true What I wished for was an hour just to sit and talk to you You have crossed the golden river to a shore forever green Each day I long to see you But God's river runs between As long as hearts keep beating As long as our eyes shed tears I will always love and miss you No matter how many years No one knows the heartache of what your parting cost but God in all His glory has gained what I have lost By your ever loving wife Sheila
