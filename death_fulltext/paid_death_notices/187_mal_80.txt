        MacGREGOR - John. The Blue Hill Troupe, Ltd. is deeply saddened by the death of our colleague and dear friend on July 25. A devoted member of the Troupe since 1954 and President in 1976, John graced our productions with his sets, costumes, props and graphics, he served on innumerable committees and he will be gratefully remembered by Troupers to whom he was an unselfish and encouraging mentor. We miss him a lot. The BHT Board
