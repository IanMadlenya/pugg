        GALLO-Suzanne. Merce Cunningham and the dancers, faculty, staff, and board of directors of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company and Cunningham Dance Foundation mourn the passing of our beloved costume designer and wardrobe supervisor, Suzanne Gallo, whose brilliant and innovative designs enriched many of Merce Cunningham's works. We will miss her unfailingly cheerful presence and extend our deepest sympathy to the members of her family.
