The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn the death of Mario Modestini, a generous benefactor whose gifts of a Chiari painting of Bathsheba and, with his wife, a Granacci Madonna enhanced the Musem's European paintings collection. His connoisseurship and passion for art will be missed by all knew who him. James R. Houghton, Chairman Philippe de Montebello, Director Emily K. Rafferty, President
