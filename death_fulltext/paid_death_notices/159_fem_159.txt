        STONE - FRIEDLANDER - Judy, M.D. The Partners and staff of Concord/Kips Bay Medical Group extend their deepest sympathies to our colleague and partner, Charles Friedlander, on the untimely passing of his wife. The quintessential 20th century woman, Judy Stone-Friedlander somehow managed to fit motherhood of six wonderful children and three separate, extremely successful careers into her all too short lifetime. She was a physician, loved and respected for her tenderness and sensitivity to her patients during her medical career, and equally known and respected for her financial acumen in her business career. The love of her husband and family knew no bounds. Truly a woman for all seasons.
        STONE-Judy W. Friedlander, M.D. The faculty and staff of New York University School of Medicine and its Department of Medicine mourn the passing of Dr. Judy Stone, an alumna of the Class of 1973. Having completed a fellowship in Hematology she remained at NYU where she was an Instructor in Clinical Medicine and had an active practice in Hematology/Oncology for a number of years. She will be remembered by her patients and fellow faculty members as a warm, caring physician. We extend our condolences to her husband Charles Friedlander, M.D., Clinical Associate Professor of Medicine at NYU, her six children and her brother. Robert M. Glickman, M.D., Dean Martin J. Blaser, M.D., Chairman, Department of Medicine, New York University School of Medicine
