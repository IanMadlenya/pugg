        $(6$)ANCHIN--Howard, CPA. The partners and staff of Anchin, Block & Anchin LLP mourn the loss of Howard Anchin, CPA, father of our esteemed Managing Partner, James Anchin, CPA, and father of retired Senior Manager Roberta Strasburg. From 1969 to 1982 Howard served as Managing Partner of Anchin, Block & Anchin. His boundless energy and extraordinary vision helped transform the firm into one of the largest and most respected accounting and consulting firms in the country. He possessed an unwavering dedication to his clients, truly epitomizing the term ''trusted advisor'' so widely used by CPAs everywhere today. Howard was an extraordinary mentor, having helped guide and shape the practices of many of the firm's current partners. During his 51 years in the accounting industry, his literary contributions and keen insights contributed widely to the profession. We extend our deepest sympathies to his children, Jim and wife Joan, Roberta and husband Phil; his grandchildren, Scott, Lee, Laurence and Donald; and his great grandchildren, Jared and Todd. The loss of Howard is a loss not only to our professional family but to the entire accounting profession. Services will take place Monday, April 17 at 11:45 AM at Riverside Chapel, 180 West 76 Street. The Partners of Anchin, Block & Anchin LLP
