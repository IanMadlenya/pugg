        GOLDSTEIN-Joseph. The Director and Faculty of Yale University's Child Study Center are deeply saddened by the loss of our fellow faculty member, Joseph Goldstein, Sterling Professor of Law, on March 12, 2000. His creative, extraordinary teaching and scholarship brought the Law School and Child Study Center together in their concern for the best interests of the child. We express our heartfelt sympathy to his family and his students. Donald J. Cohen, M.D. Director, Yale Child Study Center
