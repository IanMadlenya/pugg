        ROGIN-Lillian. It is with profound sorrow that The Officers, Board, and Members of UCP of New York City, mourn the passing of Lillian Rogin, devoted wife of the late Robert I. Rogin, who served for many years as Chairman of the Board. Lillian Rogin used the skills through her theatrical career to serve the disabled in our community. As head of UCP of NYC's Speakers Bureau, she enlisted, trained and scheduled advocates for individuals with Cerebral Palsy, and their families, and served on the Womens' Division Board. Both she and Bob Rogin worked with tireless dedication to assure a better future for all children and adults with Cerebral Palsy. We extend our deepest condolences to the family. Leo Hausman, President Jack Hausman, Founder UCP of NYC
