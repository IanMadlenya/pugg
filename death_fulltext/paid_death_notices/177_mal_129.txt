        BREAKSTONE-Arnold. This very much loved husband, father, brother, uncle and friend succumbed to pancreatic cancer on October 7, 2001. The dignity with which he courageously battled this painful disease should be the criterion by which we all live our lives. He was the consummate gentleman. His kindness, good nature, and sense of humor will forever stay in our memories. We love you Arnie. Your premature parting from us will leave a hole in our lives. A eulogy will be held at the Lincoln Park Funeral Home, 625 McLean Ave, Yonkers, NY on Wednesday, October 10th at 12:30 PM. In lieu of flowers and baskets, please make donations in Arnie's name to The Lustgarten Foundation, which is striving to find a cure for pancreatic cancer, 1111 Stewart Avenue, Bethpage, NY 11714 or lustgartenfoundation.org
