        SILBERMAN-Samuel J. (Buddy). Fairleigh Dickinson University sincerely regrets the passing of our long-time friend and benefactor. The University community joins us in extending our sincere sympathy to his wife Lois, his children and grandchildren. Mr. Silberman served as a member of our Board for thirty years and continued as trustee emeritus until his passing. In 1968, in recognition of his outstanding generosity and dedicated service, the University was honored and privileged to name The Samuel J. Silberman College of Business and to confer upon him an honorary doctor of laws. We will sorely miss his wisdom, counsel and presence. J. Michael Adams, President Fairleigh Dickinson University, Paul Lerman, Dean The Samuel J. Silberman College of Business
