        LEVITT--Mortimer. On July 12, your great and courageous heart could no longer sustain life in you. During the 98 years you spent on this earth you were known as merchant prince, philanthropist, producer, author, and above all as a confirmed iconoclast. You wanted to live to 104, but you will live much longer because we will carry forward your vision and your dreams. Your wife Mimi, your daughter Elizabeth, and your son Peter, will miss your strong presence and your wonderful sense of humor. You influenced the lives of many people with your intelligence, your creativity, your exquisite taste and your zest for life. We will celebrate your remarkable accomplishments and your extraordinary spirit at a memorial tribute a la Mortimer in September. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be sent to Young Concert Artists, 250 West 57 St., New York, NY, or Friends of the Levitt Pavilion, 85 East Holly St., Pasadena CA. 91103. To receive information about the memorial service send an email to: MortimerMemorial@aol.com
        LEVITT--Mortimer. We note with great sadness the passing of our good friend, Mortimer. His dry wit, strong opinions, appreciation of dance and his marketing savvy will be much missed. Our deepest condolences to Mimi Levitt and her family. The Board and Staff of The Joyce Theater
