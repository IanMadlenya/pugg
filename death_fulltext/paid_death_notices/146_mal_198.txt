        GLUCKSTERN - REISS - Hazzan Joshua. The Cantors Assembly records with sorrow the passing of a beloved colleague who fought a valiant battle with Leukemia. A 1998 graduate of the H.L. Miller Cantorial School of the J.T.S.A. He was an outstanding student and brilliant star upon the horizon of Hazzanut. He served as cantor of Congregation Gates of Prayer, Flushing, New York. His kindness, humanity and caring inspires us all. We extend our sympathy to his wife, Rabbi Karen, his parents and his loved ones. May his memory abide as a blessing. Hazzan Henry Rosenblum, Pres. Hazzan Stephen J. Stein, Exec. VP Hazzan Abraham B. Shapiro, Exec. Administrator
