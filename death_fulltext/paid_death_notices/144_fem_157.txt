        STONE-Ruth. We remember a woman who was never frightened to take on the challenge; who befriended anyone in need; always gave herself for others and was forever loyal; who endured life's hardships head on and with a bright light in her eyes. Our hearts grieve at your passing and hope that life beyond is full of the joy and happiness you richly deserve. We will miss our times together. Services will be at the Nardone Funeral Home, 414 Washington St, Peekskill, N.Y. 914-737-1363 on Tuesday, January 19 at 10AM. Interment follows at Assumption Cemetery.
