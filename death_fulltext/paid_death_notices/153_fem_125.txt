        BEUDERT - Monique. The Trustees, artists, and staff of Studio in a School mourn the passing of their good friend and colleague, Monique Beudert. Her love of art and passion for sharing it with young people should serve as examples to us all. She will be sorely missed. Agnes Gund, Founder Thomas Cahill, Executive Director The Studio in a School Association
