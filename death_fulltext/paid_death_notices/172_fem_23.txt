        YASGUR-Florence Ruth Fishman filled our lives with boundless love, happiness and inspiration. She was caring, respectful, determined and self-sacrificing. Always cognizant of her past, she built for the future. Our wife, mother & grandmother taught us about God, Judaism and ourselves. She was a committed Jew, ardent Zionist, active community member and benefactor of numerous charities. Florence was a special woman and super lady who treasured friendships and greeted others with her warm, genuine smile. As a teacher of literature she shared the beauty of life with young adults and helped shape their future. Florence was a vivacious woman who loved travel, theatre, the arts and literature. Most of all she loved her family: husband of 51 years, Harold, children, Rabbi Benjamin and Barbara, Rabbi Jordan, Sharie and Dr. Ezra Sofair, grandchildren Ayala, Ari, Nava, Danit, Miriam, Gila, Avi, Leora, Elie, Refael, Natan and Yehuda Shalom. Our dear Florence was called to her Maker on April 30/7 Iyar. Her love and impact will be with us forever.
