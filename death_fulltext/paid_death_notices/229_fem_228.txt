        HERSHENSON - Rose. Fiercely independent, inscrutably honest, altruistic and unselfish. Died February 26, near 95 years old. Survived by son Jay, daughter-in-law Rebecca, grandchildren Bradley and Haley, brother Jack, and many family members. Her wishes: no visitations or service. In lieu of flowers, family welcomes contributions in her name to Louis Armstrong Middle School, Corona, Queens; she petitioned for its founding and volunteered there for years.
