        KAWITZKY-Sherry. On October 31, 2001. Her heartbroken husband Ronald, her children Simon and Deanna and her sister Karen Bressler mourn her untimely passing after a long illness. Our doer, our provider, our comforter is no more. We will never understand why. Only our love for her, and hers for us, can sustain us. Rest in peace our darling. Service Sunday, 11:45AM, at ''The Riverside'', 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue.
        KAWITZKY-Sherry. We mourn the loss of our beloved Sherry. Brave, strong, cultured, spirited, a woman we admired. Her Deanna and Simon have inherited her soul. To Ronald she bequeathed her love. Sherry and Sylvia
