        ROMAINE--Ralph O. Age 87. On June 26, 2005 in Hastings, Nebraska. Born April 14, 1918 in Portland, Oregon to Lillian and Orie Romaine, Ralph began his career in aviation with his first solo flight in a Taylor Cub at the age of 18. Never far from the stick and rudder thereafter, he became a flight instructor at the Spartan School of Aviation in 1941 and taught aspiring British fighter pilots who went on to win the Battle of Britain at the Number 3 British Flying Training School in Miami, Oklahoma. He later became a test pilot with Brewster Aeronautical Corporation, Fisher Body Aircraft Division in Clevland, and the McDonnell Aircraft Corporation in Saint Louis in 1945, where he was the test pilot for the first U.S. Navy jet fighter, the FH-1 Phantom, including the aircraft carrier takeoff and landing demonstration flights at Patuxent Naval Air Station, through acceptance of the Phantom by the Navy. In 1946, he joined Edo Corporation in New York as chief test pilot, later advancing to Vice President of Marketing and President of Edo Commerial Corporation. He retired from active managerial responsibilities in 1978, but remained on the Board of Directors until 1994, 48 years of association with the company. He was a member of the Quiet Birdmen and the Experimental Aircraft Association. He is survived by his wife of 64 years, Vera, his two sons, Gary and Randolph, and one grandchild.
