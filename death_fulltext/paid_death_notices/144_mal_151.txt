        GOLDSTEIN-Leon M. The family of Leon M. Goldstein celebrates his life and mourns his passing on January 8, 1999. Beloved husband of Mary and dear father of Michael and Lisa, his life was one of giving to others, most especially of giving of himself. He was constant in his loving commitment toward his family and friends and he was constant in his commitment to his ideals. These were expressed brilliantly during his long career with the City University of New York and his 28 years as President of Kingsborough Community College. He lived his life devoted to the tenets of his deeply held religious beliefs. We pray that his soul is in the loving arms of Our Lord, Our God. Services will be held at 1:15 PM, on Sunday, January 10 at ''The Riverside'', West 76 Street and Amsterdam Ave. The family requests that in lieu of flowers, those who wish, may make donations in the name of Leon M. Goldstein to the Scholarship Fund at Kingsborough Community College, 2001 Oriental Blvd., Brooklyn, NY 11235.
