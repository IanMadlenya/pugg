        GARTNER-Mary T. The Community Synagogue Max D. Raiskin Center mourns the passing of our trustee and member of almost 60 years. Mary Gartner served as president of the sisterhood, chairlady of the bazaar and journal committees, and always thought first of how to serve and improve our synagogue. Our condolences to her son Alan and to her grandchildren and great-grandchildren around the world who gave her so much nachas. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Jack Lebewohl Chairman, Board of Trustees Brenda Pace, President
