        LOUGHRAN--Rev. James N. Brooklyn College mourns the passing of the Rev. James N. Loughran, S.J., president of St. Peters College, Jersey City, NJ, and former acting president of Brooklyn College. Having already earned a noteworthy reputation as a scholar, teacher and administrator, Rev. Loughran in 1992 took up the post of acting president following the death in office of his predecessor, Robert L. Hess, and fulfilled the duties of his office with his usual grace and humor until a permanent replacement could be installed. He was a good and lasting friend to all of us at Brooklyn College. Christoph M. Kimmich, President
