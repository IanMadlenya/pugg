        GORDON-Stanley. Combining a huge heart, gentle irreverence and a gift for forming lasting relationships, he provided guidance, hope and opportunity to hundreds of students and colleagues. After a successful career in business he worked for the pure pleasure of helping students he treated as family members. Unrestrained by long standing health problems he was a tireless presence at school, community meetings and each venue where new resources for students could be found. His legacy will be an unparalleled standard for supporting young adults with wisdom, energy and love. A memorial service to celebrate his life will be held at the school on Thursday, March 13 at 4 P.M. Howard Friedman, Principal Faculty, Staff and Students of Manhattan Comprehensive Night and Day High School
