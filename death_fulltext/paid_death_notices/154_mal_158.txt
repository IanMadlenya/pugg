        GOLDSTEIN-Maurice Aaron. A gentleman, a scholar, a friend without equal, a person who savored life to the fullest and shared it with family and friends; compassionate, wise and deeply involved with the community. A bon vivant, a man of style and breeding. I am lucky to have been a part of his life. I'll be seeing you, kid. Hank Meirowitz
        GOLDSTEIN-Maurice Aaron. A good friend, a confidant, a part of our family for the past 35 years, Maurice was always there when needed. He will be sorely missed and never replaced. Bella Meirowitz
