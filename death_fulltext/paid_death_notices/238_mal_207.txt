        RAUCH--Theodore G. Lifelong resident of New York City, died November 9, at age 72 from complications of pneumonia and septic shock. A librarian for several decades at Columbia University, Ted was a proud secular Jew who fought all his life for the rights and dignity of all living things. Especially committed to Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Transgender rights, his work with many LGBT groups contributed to the greater freedom and respect LGBT people enjoy today despite the homophobia that still works to impede that progress. Ted loved life, music, playing the piano, reading, travel, and good fellowship with his many friends. He is survived by his loving life partner of 30 years, Lester Strong, along with many loving family members. A future memorial will be announced. Donations in his memory can be made to any of his favorite organizations: Gay Men's Health Crisis, A&U Magazine, Americans for Peace Now, ACLU, Southern Poverty Law Center, North Shore Animal League, Sierra Club.
