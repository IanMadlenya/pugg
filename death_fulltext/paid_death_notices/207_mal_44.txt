        PECK -- Stephen M. The Mount Sinai Alumni mourn the untimely loss of Stephen Peck, a member of the Mount Sinai Medical Center Board of Trustees for over 30 years and Chairman from 1995 to 2002. Mr. Peck was a great visionary who understood that our institution was founded on the humanitarian traditions of scholarship and charity, and promoted these values continuously throughout his tenure. He was always sensitive to the need of the medical center to serve a diverse community. Mr. Peck will be sorely missed by the alumni and those of us whose lives he touched. Our sincerest condolences to his family who has been, as Mr. Peck was, dedicated to the future of our institution. William G. Stein, M.D. President Barry D. Stimmel, M.D. Vice President Elliot J. Rayfield, M.D. Secretary Betty J. Mintz, M.D. Treasurer
