        STURGES-Benjamin. The Volunteers and Staff of Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) deeply mourn the death of our friend and colleague, Benjamin Sturges. From 1975-1980 he was a highly valued member of the PPFA Board which richly benefited from his fund raising acumen, sound business judgement, and passionately articulate leadership. A long-time advocate for the health and rights of women, he founded the PPFA Alumni Association in 1982 and was honorary board member of Planned Parenthood of Rhode Island, where he had been active since 1965. We send our sincere condolences to his family. Sharon Allison, Chairperson Gloria Feldt, Pres. Planned Parenthood Federation of America.
