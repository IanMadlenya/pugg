        HARRIS--Chauncy Dennison. On December 26, 2003. The American Geographical Society celebrates the extraordinary life of Chauncy Harris and mourns his passing. In addition to his invaluable leadership in the larger comunity of geographical scholarship worldwide, Chauncy served as a Councilor of AGS from 1961-1974, and as Vice President from 1969-1974. He was a longtime member of the editorial board of AGS's ''Geographical Review,'' a key player in the founding of AGS's ''Soviet Geography,'' and co-editor of the latter for many years. In 1985 the Society awarded him The Cullum Geographical Medal for his service in the ''advancement of geographical science'' writ large. His particular loyalty to and support of AGS continued, however, up until his very last days. We will miss his sage advice and unstinting friendship. His was a life well lived, and the American Geographical Society was fortunate to be a significant part of it. John E. Gould, Chair Jerome E. Dobson, President Mary Lynne Bird, Executive Director
