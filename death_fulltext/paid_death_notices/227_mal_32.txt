        HECTOR--Louis. The Board of Directors of The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center notes with sadness the passing of Louis Hector, a longstanding board member and board member emeritus. An elegant and sophisticated man, he loved his Sunday afternoon chamber music concerts and was a loyal and generous patron. The broad experience he brought to our organization from the worlds of business and culture made him a wise and valued colleague, and we will miss him. Peter Frelinghuysen Chairman Donaldson C. Pillsbury Vice-Chairman The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center
