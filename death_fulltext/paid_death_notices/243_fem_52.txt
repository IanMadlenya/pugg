        STUART--Catherine, Ph.D., The William Alanson White Psychoanalytic Institute and Society are deeply grieved by the sudden loss of one of it's most treasured and beloved colleagues. Dr. Stuart was intimately involved in almost every vital aspect of Institute functioning; as Training and Supervising Analyst; Member of the Council of Fellows and the Training and Admissions Committees; Co-Founder of the Eating Disorders, Compulsions and Addictions Service; Chair of the Diversity Committee; teaching faculty in several divisions and cogent supporter of the application of psychoanalysis to organizational work. She offered her professional expertise and fine intellect with singular generosity, and applied herself to all tasks with passionate energy. Cathy's colleagues, students, and patients were the fortunate recipients of her wisdom and of her warmth, curiosity, and lively humor. She embraced life fully with a profound love for her family for whom our sympathy is beyond words. The psychoanalytic community has lost one of it's bright lights. Dr. Joerg Bose, Director Dr. Charles Harrington, President, Board of Trustees Dr. Clark Sugg, President, White Society
