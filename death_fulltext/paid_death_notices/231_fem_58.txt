        COHEN--Shirley Pollan, my loving mother, passed away on April 6, 2006. My mother was a proud and vivacious woman who raised herself up to become a loving mother, grandmother and sister. She felt very deeply about many things and expressed it through her eloquent poetry. She was passionate about life, especially the arts. I will always treasure the good memories we had together. Mom, your struggle is over; it is time to rest. You will always be in my heart. I love you. Your daughter, Leah
