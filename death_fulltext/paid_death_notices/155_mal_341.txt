        COHEN-Albert B. The Board of Directors and staff of UJA-Federation of New York are deeply saddened by the loss of Albert B. Cohen, a generous supporter of our organization and a true friend of the Jewish community. He was responsible, with his wife Bernice who survives him, for numerous acts of philanthropy which have touched the lives of thousands. We express our sincerest condolences to Bernice, to their children Jeffrey and Shelley, Steven and Laura, Marla and Jim, and Robert, and to their nine grandchildren. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Judith Stern Peck, Chair of the Board James S. Tisch, President John S. Ruskay, Executive VP and CEO
