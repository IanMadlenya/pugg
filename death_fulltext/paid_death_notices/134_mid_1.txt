        WIEN-Joyce A. Judge Bernard Newman and his staff at the US Court of International Trade are saddened by the passing of their faithful secretary, Joyce A. Wien, on February 26, 1998. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to her family members. Joyce was a lovely and gracious lady, and will be greatly missed by all at the court.
