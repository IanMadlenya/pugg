        RICHARDS - Lloyd. NYU's Tisch School of the Arts mourns the loss of our former colleague Lloyd Richards, a pioneering director, outstanding theatre educator, and champion of new playwrights. He figured importantly in the early years of our School's Department of Acting, serving as a master teacher and then chair from 1966 to 1973. He is remembered fondly as a force for excellence and dedication in what was then the formative years of our actor training program, one of the first in the country at the time. He is considered one of the greatest contributors to the modern American theatre and we are honored to have had Lloyd serve on our faculty. His absence will be keenly felt in the theatre world. Mary Schmidt Campbell, Dean, NYU's Tisch School of the Arts
