        WISE--Tom, 60, passed away on Tuesday, May 17, 2005, the result of brain cancer. T Wise, as he was affectionately known, spent his last 50 summers at Brant Lake Camp, where he was beloved for his wisdom, loyalty, spirit and humor. Over the 89 years of Brant Lake Camp's existence, few have had as profound an impact on the campers and community, and none with a style so unique. His memory will live on in the hearts and minds of the thousands that he touched. Go, Go Otto.
