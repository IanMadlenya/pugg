        GONZALEZ--Rebecca Herrier, the talented, wellrespected, and well-loved Broadway, film and television actress passed away on January 5th, 2007, in Pacific Palisades at the age of 51. Becky Gonzalez (as she was known professionally, and to her friends) was born September 14, 1955, in Los Angeles. She appeared on Broadway in 1980 in The Roast, directed by Carl Reiner, and in L.A. in Zoot Suit. In film she starred in Ron Howard's: Night Shift, and Garry Marshall's: Young Doctors in Love. She was a featured member of the Mighty Carson Art Players on the Tonight Show, and was a recurring regular on Laverne and Shirley. She left show business to do what she loved best, which was to be a wife and mother and President of the local PTA. Her greatest pride and joy was her sons Matthew, 22, and Joseph, 17, and seeing them grow into fine young men. She is survived by her parents Robert and Antoinetta Gonzalez and her brother, Robert. In lieu of flowers please send donations in Rebecca's name to The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI).
