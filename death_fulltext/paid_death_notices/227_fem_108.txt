        ROMAN--Miriam. Age 75, died peacefully after a more than ten-year valiant struggle with the debilitating Multiple Sclerosis disease. Despite the illness that took away one kidney and put her in a wheelchair for the past five years, Miriam refused to give in to the disease, and she insisted on spending time with her friends and family at restaurants, Broadway shows, and visiting ill people.Whether she was having lunch with Donald Trump or just talking with the janitor cleaning her room, she treated all good people with the ultimate respect and courtesy. She was the ''Rock of Gibraltor'' guiding her beloved sons Steve and Larry through severe asthma, numerous broken bones and every other problem they encountered. She was selfless, being a dutiful wife, raising two boys while working full time with no help. She also cared for her elderly parents, who moved to the house next door so she could better aid them. Her friends and family loved her and visited her right up to the end, and they know she would have done the same for them. She is survived by her children Steve, Larry, Julia and Kathy, and her grandchildren Mark, Amy, Carly, Jordanna and Faryn.
