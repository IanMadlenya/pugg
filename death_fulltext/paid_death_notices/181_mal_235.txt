        SHARP-Samuel Richard. Feb. 15, 2002. For our very dear, beloved son, brother, uncle and devoted father, Samuel Richard Sharp, Esq., 1959-2002, 42 years old, who died unexpectedly. Your life has enriched & helped so many others to realize their true potential. You truly were gifted with a love for life and with the ability to show your love in great acts of kindness and generosity of spirit. You were such a giving, selfless person, only caring for the happiness of others. You were an optimist always, no matter how big the obstacles. You were such a hard worker, a perfectionist and success in everything you set out to do. In sports & your practice you were brilliant and tenacious, yet everyone you touched could not help but love you dearly as a friend. In your short life and tragic unexpected death, you left very precious memories for all who loved you and knew your love. Most of all your great sense of humor, brilliant mind and empathy for others will be sorely missed by family and friends who were so close to you. We will find it difficult to recover from such a loss & your profound influence upon us. We will truly feel your loving presence each day for the rest of our lives. All our love always, a brokenhearted mother and father Rachel and Martin Sharp, his son Thomas Sharp, who had such a very special, loving bond with his father, his devoted brothers and sistersin-law Robert and Ramy Sharp and Michael and Denise Sharp, and nephews and nieces Kyle, Dylan, Emily, Olivia, Jason and Sydney. Funeral service Sunday, February 17, 11:30 AM at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street, New York City.
