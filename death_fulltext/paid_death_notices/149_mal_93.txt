        CAHOUET-David J. Of New York City fomerly of Bernardsville, NJ died at his family's home in Princeton, NJ on Tuesday, June 1, at age 30. Born with hemophilia he was later infected, through clotting factor transfusions with HIV and officially diagnosed by New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center 1987. We pay homage to the many thousands of hemophiliacs, now dead of AIDS, as David was fortunate to have lived so long in relatively good health. A graduate of the Far Hills Country Day School, the Salisbury School, Salisbury, CT and Lake Forest College, IL. Class of 1991, David was beloved and respected by all who knew him for his love of music, sense of humor, strength of character and infinite wisdom. His stoicism in dealing first with hemophilia and then with HIV is our inspiration. He is survived by his parents James and Jean and locally by his grandmother Margaret W. Taylor, his aunts and uncles; Professor Ann Douglas, Mr. and Mrs. M. Douglas Watson and Robert G. Fairburn. Also, by Mrs. Richard L. Fogarty of Bowie, MD, Reverend Ralph H. Cahouet O.P., New York City, John J. Cahouet of Boston, MA and Mr. and Mrs. Frank V. Cahouet of Pittsburgh, PA. A memorial service for family and friends will be held June 12, The First Presbyterian Church New Vernon, NJ at 11AM. In lieu of flowers contributions to the Hemophilia Association of NJ, 37 West Prospect Street, East Brunswick, NJ 08816 are welcome.
