        WOLF--Henry. The Trustees, faculty, staff, and students of New School University and Parsons School of Design express their deep sadness at the sudden loss of Henry Wolf. An influential designer, photographer, and art director, Henry Wolf was among the shapers of twentieth century publication design. He had a long and rich association with Parsons, first as a beloved teacher and mentor in the Communication Design Department, and later as a member of the Parsons Board of Governors from 1998 to 2001. In 1996, he was awarded an honorary degree from the University for his outstanding contributions to the field of design, and in 1998 Parsons proudly celebrated his life and work with a retrospective exhibition and lecture series. Henry Wolf was also a philanthropist whose generosity was guided by a passionate interest in the School's past and future. He established a scholarship program that allowed some of the most talented students the privilege of a Parsons education. In every avenue of his engagement with Parsons, he maintained a close interest in the life of students and the academic standards for programs. This kind of broad and deep history with an institution is rare, and Henry Wolf's high standards and determined ideals will continue to have profound influence at Parsons and throughout New School University. We convey our heartfelt condolences to his sister Joan Slawson. Philip Scaturro, Chairman Board of Trustees Bob Kerrey, President New School University Paul Goldberger, Dean Parsons School of Design
