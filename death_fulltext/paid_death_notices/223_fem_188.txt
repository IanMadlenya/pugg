        GARFIELD--Frances. Died August 29 at age 95. Beloved wife of the late Irving William Garfield. Mother of Nina Joan (Alfred) Mattikow of Greenwich, CT, Alan (Marion) Garfield of Manhattan and Southampton and Ronald (Lily) Garfield of Aspen, Colorado. Grandmother of James and April Mattikow, Stacy and Jeffrey Young, David Garfield, Spencer and Tara Garfield, Jason Garfield, Oliver Garfield and Parker Chenoweth.

Grandmother and GreatGrandmother to her extended family, Sheree, Marc, Max, Danielle and Sam Holliday, Erin, Richard and Troy Hellberg, Robyn, Richard, Stephen and Addison Berniker. A consummate New Yorker, she lived a privileged life and availed herself of the rich cultural life of the city. Even as diminished eyesight in her last years forced her to give up her voracious reading habit and twice weekly bridge games, she continued to attend theater, concerts, ballet and museum exhibits. A fiercely independent woman she lived life to the fullest and was always full of life. The family requests that donations in her memory be made to Macular Degeneration Research, 22512 Gateway Center Drive, Clarksburg, MD 20871.
