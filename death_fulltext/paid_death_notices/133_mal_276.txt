        COHN-Arthur. The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers mourns the loss of its esteemed member, Arthur Cohn, an inspired composer, author, publisher, violonist, conductor and courageous advocate for 20th Century music. At age 87, he continued to serve on ASCAP's Special Classification Committee, and earned consecutive ASCAP annual awards since 1960. He was also a Deems Taylor Awards recipient for his seminal writings. To his wife Lois, daughter Leslie, and son Alan, we extend heartfelt sympathy from his ASCAP colleagues and friends.
