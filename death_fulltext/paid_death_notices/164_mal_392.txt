        FORSYTH-Benjamin, 94. Died peacefully at home September 22, 2000. He came from revolutionary Russia and led a fruitful life in Brooklyn with his soulmate and wife of 60 years, the late Emma Forsyth. He was gentle, compassionate, generous and eloquent in word and deed. He was a civil engineer for 40 years with Ammann & Whitney and published books on reinforced concrete design. His exemplary soul will be sorely missed by his three children, their spouses and children: Barbara, Michael, Daniel, Jeremy and wife Michelle Haas; Louise Forsyth and Howard, Leonora and Micaela Stein; David, Stephanie and Joshua Forsyth; by his devoted niece Dolora Lazko and his dear sisters and brothersin-law, nieces and nephews, and friends. Contributions in his honor may be made to the American Civil Liberties Union. The family will sit shiva Sunday evening, all day Monday and Tuesday, at 184 Terrace Place, Brooklyn.
