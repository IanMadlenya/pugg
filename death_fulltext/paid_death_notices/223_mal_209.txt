        FLEMING--Peter V., M.D. Born in 1950 in Czechoslovakia, died August 9, 2005 in New York of pancreatic cancer. His road to immigration at age 16 took him to Tunisia, then to Paris, finally to New York. With knowledge only of his native language his intelligence and diligence enabled him studies at M.I.T. and later studies of medicine. His wisdom and humor will be forever missed by his wife, daughter, sister, parents and friends. Memorial donations may be made to the Lustgarten Foundation for Pancreatic Cancer Research.
