A graduate of The Ohio State University, she was elected to the national Mortar Board Society, received an M.A. in Social Welfare, and practised Social Work in Columbus, OH, Pittsfield, MA and Newark, NJ. She was a member of the American Association of University Women and The National Association of Women Artists. She studied with artists including Reuben Tam, Raphael Soyer, John Gundelfinger, and Jack Potter. She had a one-woman show at the Brooklyn Museum and exhibited at the Stony Brook and other galleries. A sister of actor Paul Lipson, she is survived by her beloved sister, Charlotte Paskin, who joins her three daughters and their families in loving mourning, and by her husband, Peter Allen, who keenly loved this most lovable of women and cherishes warm memories of 65 years together. A memorial concert celebrating her life will be held in late spring.
