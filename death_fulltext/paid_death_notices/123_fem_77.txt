        HOPKINS-Anna F. The Board of Directors of The Grand Street Settlement deeply regrets the loss of our former Executive Director, and extends our deepest sympathies to her mother, Rosie Hopkins, and to her sister, Virginia Hopkins-Hayes. For nineteen years, Anna provided dedicated commitment and leadership to the agency, and loving devotion to the community. She was a leader of the New York social services community. She will be remembered well by all who had the opportunity to serve with her. Thomas I. Unterberg, Chairman John L. Furth, President Margarita Rosa, Exec Director
