        GINSBURG-Cora. With deep sorrow the Officers, Directors, and Members of The National Antique & Art Dealers Association of America (NAADAA) mourn the loss of their esteemed member, Cora Ginsburg. She had worked with her late husband, a founding member of NAADAA, at Ginsburg and Levy, then the Benjamin Ginsburg Antiquary. She went on to create her own business, Cora Ginsburg, in 1973, and to become one of the world's leading dealers in antique costume and textile. We extend our deepest sympathy to her family and friends. A memorial service is planned for early next year. Mark A. Schaffer, President Arlie Sulka, Secretary
