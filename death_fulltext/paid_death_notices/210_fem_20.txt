        JOSEPH--Fannie (Feld), 91, died in Staten Island on July 3rd, surrounded by her loving family. She was the daughter of Morris and Golda Feld (London) and is survived by her son, Samuel Kaval (Jan) of Coram, NY, daughter, Ellen Horowitz of Staten Island, sisters, Sarah Boxer of Staten Island, Pauline Jacobson of Manhattan, and brother, Joseph Feld (Mairuth) of Boca Raton. She also leaves four grandchildren, five great - grandchildren and many nieces and nephews. We, her sisters and brother, loved her deeply as she loved us and she, Sarah and Pauline, were referred to as ''The Three Graces.'' We spent many happy times together throughout the years and always remained close. In a newspaper interview a few years ago, when discussing the inevitability and losses of the passing years, Fannie said, ''Life goes on. You have to live it.'' Fannie, you have gone, life will go on, and you will live forever in our hearts. Lovingly, Sarah, Pauline and Joseph
