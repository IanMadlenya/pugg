        FURMAN-Evelyn. The Montefiore-Einstein Heart Center is sad to announce the untimely death of Mrs. Evelyn Furman, the wife of our friend, Dr. Seymour Furman, longtime Montefiore physician, surgeon and pioneer in cardiac pacemakers. Evelyn was a gifted teacher, counselor, community leader and a dedicated wife and mother. She was a wonderful friend to those of us who were fortunate enough to know her. The entire Montefiore Heart Center community expresses its condolences to Dr. Furman and family.
