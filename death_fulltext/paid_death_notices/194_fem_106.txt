        MARINGER-Irene. 90, of Ft. Lauderdale, died on Thursday, March 13, 2003. Mrs. Maringer, formerly of New York City, moved to Ft. Lauderdale 27 years ago with her late husband, Simon Maringer, M.D. She was born in Hungary in 1913 into a family that would grow to five sisters and two brothers. After getting married she spent several years in the diamond trade in Antwerp, Belgium, where her diamond cutting skills were developed. With the advent of World War II her life became one of survival. After escaping from Germany she and her husband spent the next several years in France where she gave birth to her son, George. The fall of France and its occupation by German forces once again forced them to search out freedom, which they achieved by fleeing to Switzerland where they were granted asylum. Her husband, Simon, completed his medical training and in 1947 they emigrated to the United States. After taking all the required courses she became an EEG and ECG technician in her husband's medical practice. Several years later she enrolled in studio classes that helped to develop and hone her artistic skills. Over time she became an accomplished sculptress. Her works in marble, agate, greenstone and wood were seen in group shows and galleries in NYC. Her works are in many corporate as well as private collections. But, as important as art was to her, the most important aspect of her life was her family. She was a devoted and caring wife, mother and later in life a wonderful grandmother. No matter what life threw at her she maintained her happy and smiling way. Visitors were always welcome and amazed by her green thumb and her apple strudel. Irene will be missed by all those who knew and loved her. She is survived by her son, George, and her grandson, Alan. Services will be held Monday, March 17, 2003, 10:30 AM, at Star of David Memorial Chapel, 7701 Bailey Road, North Lauderdale, FL.
