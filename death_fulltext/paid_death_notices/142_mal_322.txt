        KIM-Earl. We mourn the passing of our friend and colleague. Composer, devoted teacher, musician extraordinaire, Earl brought to music colors we only dreamed existed but had never before heard. Creative and imaginative, he was truly inspired. We extend our condolences to his beloved wife, Martha, his daughters Shawna Kent and Eva. He will be missed. Itzhak and Toby Perlman
