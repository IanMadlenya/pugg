        MORGAN -- Denise. The trustees, dean, faculty, students, staff and alumni of New York Law School mourn the death of our beloved colleague, teacher, and friend, Professor Denise Morgan in Chicago on April 8 at the age of 41. She was an extraordinary colleague. Her passing leaves a huge void in the institution that is impossible to replace. Denise wrote extensively about civil rights and equal educational opportunity. Her most recent scholarly work focused on the role of the federal government in protecting individual rights, which she explored as principal editor of ''Awakening from the Dream: Civil Rights Under Siege and the New Struggle for Equal Justice'' (2005). Denise taught federal courts, civil procedure, evidence, a seminar on race and American history and a course on education policy and the law. Her passionate concern for educational inequality in America turned to advocacy with her involvement in the landmark litigation, Campaign for Fiscal Equity, Inc. v. New York State, in which she represented the Black, Puerto Rican and Hispanic Legislative Caucus. Denise received her BA and her JD from Yale University. Before joining the New York Law School faculty in 1995, she clerked for the Honorable Marilyn Hall Patel, US District Court, Northern District of California, and worked as an associate at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton. We extend our deepest condolences to her husband, Eric Wold, their daughter Sylvan, and her mother and father, Coralee and John Morgan. A memorial service will be held in New York City. Details about the memorial, and an educational trust fund to be established for her daughter Sylvan will be available by email to jfishman@nyls.edu. Arthur N. Abbey, Chairman of the Board of Trustees Richard A. Matasar, Dean and President
