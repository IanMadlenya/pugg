        CLARK-Lon. We mourn the loss of our dear and highly respected member. A Player since 1945, Lon was a true man of the theatre as well as radio. His feistiness and tenacity for what he thought right will be remembered by generations of our members. His contributions to his beloved profession will be appreciated by generations of actors. Our deepest sympathies to Michele and his family. The Players
