        BRECKIR--Dorothy K. Died July 29, 2005 in New York City at the age of 97. Her last few years were a struggle between her body and her mind for autonomy. She is finally at rest after a long, productive life. Beside a host of loving and caring friends, wonderfully supportive healthcare givers, she is survived by her daughter Patricia Breckir Miller and husband Irwin, her son Joseph Breckir, grandchildren Jane Miller Henderson and Bart, James Miller and Dale, Luke Miller, Ellen Lear and Peter Ruig, Kate Lear and Jonathan LaPook, Maggie Lear and Daniel Katz and her great-granchildren Olivia, Lily, Owen, Clementine, Daniel, Noah, Griffen, Zoe and Zaneta. She will be missed by all. A celebration of her life will be held at a future date. Contributions may be made in her memory to People for the American Way.
