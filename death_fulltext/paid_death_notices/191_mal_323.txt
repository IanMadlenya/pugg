        BACCAGLINI - Edmond J. The former and present members of the Office of the Inspector General, NYC-SCA, record in sorrow the passing of their beloved colleague and leader, a founding member of the IG's Office. Before serving as an Assistant IG, he had been a NYPD Deputy Inspector and a Commanding Officer of both the Manhattan and Bronx District Attorneys Office Squads and the Major Case Squad. He embodied the finest qualities of a New York City cop. His devotion as a husband, father, friend and police officer will never be forgotten.
