        GILLETTE-Gina, whose age was variously noted as 21, 29, 52 and early 80's, died of natural causes on March 16th, surrounded by her family as the sun set and the full moon rose in Granite Bay, California. Born in New York City to Josephine and D.D. Vincent, Gina was an artist by training, with a gifted eye for color and pattern. Gina did volunteer work for many years and assisted her husband in his business affairs. As a young woman, Gina spent a number of years in Italy, where she was wined and dined by the sons and daughters of the ruling class. With a keen sense of adventure, and first hand experience of ''la dolce vita'', Gina escaped with her father through Casablanca back to America when World War II broke out. At the end of the war Gina met and married Noeth B. Gillette; a young naval aviator from the great western state of Montana. Gina's interests included the fine arts, needle point, reading, traveling, gardening, sports shopping, Etruscan culture, and her many cats. Gina loved her ritual evening swim followed by a hot bath and a glass of one of her favorite California white wines. This ritual was always followed by an Italian dinner prepared by her beloved husband Noeth; a man of great intelligence, generosity and humor, who preceded her in death by 10 years. Gina leaves behind many good friends; two daughters, Maria and Lisa; a son-in-law, John Manzo; a granddaughter, Alisa; and two cousins, Grace Mungiole and Lucille Archer; who were both like sisters to her. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made to the Gina V. Gillette Memorial Library Fund, Palos Verdes Library District, Attn: Barbara Roberts, 701 Silver Spur Road, Rolling Hills Estates, California, 90274.
