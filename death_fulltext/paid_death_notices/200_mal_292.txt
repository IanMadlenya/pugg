        ROBINSON -- Bennett. The staff of Robinson Kurtin Communications! (RKC!) mourns the sudden passing of a great designer, a friend and a true mentor to us all. Bennett's leadership and offthe-charts standard of excellence made us better artists, better writers and better people. At 74, he still loved to take on new challenges and couldn't wait to get to work each morning. If bottled, Bennett's energy and enthusiasm could have lit up a city. Instead, it lit up the lives of all who knew him. We learned our lessons well and will continue, but he will be missed.
