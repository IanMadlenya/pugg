        DUBINSKY--Joseph, M.D. Beloved husband of Louise for 50 years. Proud and loving father of Steven and Leslie. Father-in-law of Dina and Carol, and delighted Poppa of Noah and Liza. A man of wit, wisdom and kindness; an independent spirit who cared deeply for his family, friends, patients and colleagues. He taught us how to live with humility and to die courageously. Services Monday at Plaza Jewish Community Chapel. In lieu of flowers contributions in Joe's name to Hertzberg Palliative Care Institute, Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, or National Wildlife Federation, would be appreciated.
