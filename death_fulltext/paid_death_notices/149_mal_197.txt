        TAUB-Martin G. Devoted husband of Frances Israel Taub, deceased. Loving father of Richard, David and Linda. Loving grandfather of Andrew, Marc and Sandy, Josh and Lisa, Neela, and Zach. Loving great-grandfather of Jake. Died June 12, 1999, after a valiant struggle. Wine merchant extraordinaire, he had been founder of Gallo Wine Distributors, Inc., co-founder of Premier Wine and Spirits, and Palm Bay Imports. No matter what the adversities, he never lost his warmth and amazing wit. Intensely committed to family, he passed on that love to his children and grandchildren, as well as passing on his affection for bad puns. He will be sorely missed. Funeral Monday, June 14, at 11 AM, Gutterman's Funeral Home, Jericho Turnpike, Woodbury.
