        BRENNGLASS--Samuel L. The Officers and staff of the Orthodox Union extend their deepest condolences to the family of Samuel Brennglass, an OU leader for the past 70 years, Honorary Chairman of the Board for the past 28, and a mentor to generations of OU and NCSY leaders. A brilliant attorney, he won the historic Mt. Clemens mechitza case, which ended threats to the sanctity of the Orthodox synagogue. An historic and visionary figure, he will be greatly missed. Stephen J. Savitsky, Pres. Harvey Blitz, Chrm. of the Bd. Rabbi T.H. Weinreb, Exec VP
