        SILVEY-Harold. The staff of the League Treatment Center sends our deepest sympathies to Lucille Silvey and her family on the death of her husband, Harold. Harold was a friend of the handicapped children and the League Treatment Center. We hope his many kindnesses will sustain the family at this time. Our devotion to his wife, Lucille, and his family and their many friends.
