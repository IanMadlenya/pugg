        GIORDANO-Ned. Beloved husband of Linda and father of Joan and Catherine. Passed away suddenly on Friday, August 25, 2000. The quintessential husband and father, Ned was deeply devoted to his family, the most important people in his life. A devout Roman Catholic, member of St. Paul's Church in Brookville and the Church of the Holy Innocents in NYC, in which he served as Lector and Eucharistic Minister, he was also a member of the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre. Among his favorite works was leading a communion service in the Adult Home in Westbury. He was recently accepted into the permanent diaconate training program in the Diocese of Rockville Centre. His love and God shone forth in everything he did. His colleagues and employees at Jordan Fashions in Manhattan loved him dearly for the warmth and personal care that he showed towards them on a daily basis. With his wife, Linda, he was a powerful supporter of the inspirational radio program ''As You Think,'' spearheading the fundraising initiatives for that program. His warm smile and open heart endeared him to everyone he met. His gift for making and keeping friends and for doing anything possible personally to help those in need enriched the lives of countless people the world over. Ned's sudden passing leaves a tremendous void, but his shining character and loving heart inspired all of us who miss him to follow his example. The world is infinitely better for his presence among us. Ned is also survived by his mother and father, Marty and Tina Giordano, his two sisters, Marie and Elizabeth, and his two children, Catherine and Joan, as well as his wife, Linda, of 21 years. In repose at the Fairchild Funeral Chapel, 1570 Northern Blvd., Manhasset, LI, Monday, 3-5 and 7-9 PM. Funeral mass Tuesday at St. Paul's Church in Brookville. Entombment in Holy Rood Cemetery.
