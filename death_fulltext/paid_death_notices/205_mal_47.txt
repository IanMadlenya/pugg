        HARRIS--Jeff Steve. Age 68. Unhappy with Mets post-season acquisitions and current Ranger goaltending, passed away in his sleep at his home in Easthampton on February 2. True cause of death was Emphysema. His memory will live on in the hearts of many: his beloved wife of 40 years, Judy, son Barnaby, daughter Hillary, son-in-law Bob Wasson, grandchildren Charlie and Benjamin and inlaws Ruth and Irving Schatz. His compassion, creativity, integrity and profound sense of humor are the lasting qualities that will live within us forever. Burial will be private with a memorial service to be announced. In lieu of flowers donations may be made to The Actors' Fund.
        HARRIS--Jeff. The families of Aaron Kozak and Arnold Toren and A. Kozak and Company, LLP deeply regret the passing of our good friend, Jeff Harris. Our heartfelt sympathies are extended to his wife Judy and children Hillary and Barnaby. He will be sorely missed.
