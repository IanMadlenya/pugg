        FRASCA--Anthony. Died at his home in Delray Beach, FL, on August 28, 2006 at the age of 83. Good friends called him ''Rip'' and his humor, generosity and charm won him very many of them throughout his life. In 1940 he joined his five older brothers in the fur business, eventually becoming sole proprietor of T. Frasca Furs. He was an innovator, a meticulous craftsman, and a great favorite of his female clients, old and young. Rip loved a game of pinochle, a round of golf, a day at the track, or a turn on the dance floor. He had an encyclopedic knowledge of jazz and knew more about Frank Sinatra than Sinatra knew about himself. He is predeceased by his beloved wife, Viola, and six of his eight siblings. His daughters, Christine, Doreen and Robin, his sister, Mary, and his grand daughter, Hillary, express their love for him and their grief at his passing.
