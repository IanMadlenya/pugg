        UNGERLEIDER - Peter. The Covenant Foundation mourns the untimely passing of Peter Ungerleider, President of the Dorot Foundation. Our work together on ''The Hating Pot'' and the Jewish Civics Initiative, brought us close to this remarkable person. Peter was an exemplary man, a dear friend, and a talented artist. We extend our deepest sympathy to his beloved wife, Kathrin ScheelUngerleider, and his adored siblings-Jeanie Ungerleider Springer, Steven and Andrew. May the mourners find comfort among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Judith Ginsberg, Exec. Dir. Eli N. Evans, Chairman The Covenant Foundation
