        CHURCH-Edwin, MD. The William Alanson White Psychoanalytic Institute and Society express deep sorrow at the loss of an extraordinary colleague and 1964 graduate. Under circumstances, none would choose, Dr. Church modeled resolve and valor in his eleven year confrontation with ALS. During this time he remained as fully engaged in the real world as he could and, by example, exhorted others to carry on life's struggles with courage and tenacity. It falls to us to maintain his profoundly psychoanalytic legacy. May this serve as some comfort to his family, friends, and patients. Marylou Lionells, Ph.D., Director, White Institute Robert I. Watson, Jr., Ph.D., President, White Society
