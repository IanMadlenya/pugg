        ZISES--Ruth. The Board of Directors of the Genesis Foundation and Genesis Centers in Israel mourn the loss of Mrs. Ruth Zises. Ruth's support of Judaism and Torah scholarship in Israel was unparalleled. Her devotion to her husband Bernie, her sons Seymour, Selig, and our President, Jay; her seven grandchildren and five greatgrandchildren was exemplary. She was the paradigm of the Jewish matriarch. We are eternally thankful for her good advice, warmth and kind heart. Howard P. Ronson, Chairman of the Board Rabbi Jay Marcus, Director The Genesis Foundation Genesis Centers, Jerusalem/Beit Shemesh, Israel
        ZISES--Ruth. As we prepare to greet the Sabbath queen, we say goodbye to the queen of the Zises family, Mrs. Ruth Zises. We will be forever indebted to Ruth for the love and devotion she extended to our family as she considered us part of her mishpocha. The bounty of her life will serve as a source of inspiration and motivation. As a tribute to Ruth, we will dedicate ourselves to the ideals that were most important to her; family, Judaism and Israel. Rabbi Jay and Barbara Marcus, Rav Ari Marcus, Rav Elie Marcus, Rav Doni Marcus, Rav Chaim Marcus, Mrs. Ora Mischel and their families
