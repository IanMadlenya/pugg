        JEROME--Ida Judith Intrator. Dee Jerome, age 77, died Saturday, March 26 at St. Peter's Medical Center, New Brunswick, NJ. A resident of Monroe Township, NJ, Dee was the loving mother of daughters Deborah Jerome-Cohen and Mimi Krumholz. She was the proud grandmother of Specialist Matthew Lee, U.S. Army, Aaron Lee, Tess Cohen, Seth Cohen, Spencer Cohen and Paul Krumholz, and generous mother-in-law of Roger Cohen and Andy Krumholz. She was the devoted wife and indispensible partner of the late Jack W. Jerome. Dee was born and spent her early childhood in Vienna, making her one of that shrinking cohort who experienced and survived the monstrous storm of Nazi violence. Her father and mother, Michael and Miriam Intrator, took the family out of Austria shortly after the Anschluss, making their way first to Belgium and then through occupied France. The family made its way to Portugal, where on August 16, 1941, they found passage among 765 other refugees on the Spanish freighter Navemar--one of the last voyages of escapees from Europe. Dee's children and grandchildren bear in their hearts eternal, existential gratitude for her family's valor and persistence. Her intelligence, humor and immense energy were a gift to us all. Our family is particularly gladdened that Dee lived long enough to know of the safe return earlier this month of her eldest grandson, Matthew, from Iraq, where for the past year he has served in harm's way the country that gave his grandmother safe haven.
