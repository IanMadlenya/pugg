        SCHULTE-Lily. The Women's Campaign Board of the American Jewish Committee is deeply saddened by the death of Lily Schulte, a longtime and dedicated supporter and, along with her husband David, a member of AJC's National Leadership Council. Each year, David presents AJC's Harriet H. Jonas Award named in memory of his mother, a founding member of the Women's Campaign. We send our condolences to David, their children, grandchildren and the rest of the grieving family. Elaine Petschek, Hon. Chair Stephanie Saft, Chair
