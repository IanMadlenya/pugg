        HALLINAN-Richard. The Board of Trustees, staff and volunteers of the national office of the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation mourn the passing of our esteemed former chairman, Richard J. Hallinan, Esq. Mr. Hallinan served as a member of the Board of Trustees from 1965 to 1992 and held the position of vice chairman. He was named chairman of the Board in 1984 and served in that office until 1988. Mr. Hallinan was a true humanitarian who cared deeply about our work to improve infant health, and his vision and leadership were especially valuable to our research program to fund lifesaving medical breakthroughs for babies. We extend our deepest sympathy to his family. Jennifer L. Howse, Ph.D., President Richard J. Freeman, Chairman
