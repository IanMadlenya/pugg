        MARX-James M. Soldiers', Sailors', Marines' and Airmen's Club deeply regrets the untimely death of our key Vice President for Legal Affairs, Jim Marx, a truly gallant gentleman. An attorney of consequence, Jim was a prime mover in the Club's emergence as a vital factor in our Post-War ability to help our Military friends and their families. And the completely pro bono guidance that he gave us throughout so many years set an example of ethical conduct that is unequaled, as was his understanding of the needs of eleemosynary organizations such as ours. In truth, Jim's credo for the practice of law paralleled adherence to the Hippocratic Oath in medicine. While with his passing, our Club has lost a towering legal presence and an extraordinary human being, Jim can at least rest easy in the knowledge that at the SSMAC, his legacy of concern for our Military lives on. R.I.P. Ivan Obolensky, Chairman of the Board
