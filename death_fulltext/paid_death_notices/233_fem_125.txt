        $(6$)FEILER--Regina. Jack, your friends and colleagues at Palisade Capital are saddened by the passing of your loving mother, Regina Feiler. We had grown very fond of her over the years and always admired her strength and fortitude--a woman so full of life. It was a pleasure and a privilege to know her. We truly believe that all the love and affection showered upon her by you and your devoted family sustained her through these last trying years and made them more enjoyable despite her illness. She led an extraordinary life having survived the challenges of the Holocaust and will be deeply missed by all who knew and loved her. We extend our deepest sympathies to you and your family.
