        ZAREMBA -- Sylvia. The House of Steinway & Sons notes with great sorrow the passing of the American pianist Sylvia Zaremba on June 3 in Columbus, Ohio at the age of 74. A native of Chicopee, Massachusetts, Sylvia Zaremba was a valued member of our Steinway Artist family for 61 years. A child prodigy, Ms. Zaremba gave her first public performance at age five. She debuted with the Cleveland Orchestra under Artur Rodzinski at age ten, and gave her New York recital debut at Town Hall in the same year. In addition to tours of the European music capitals, Ms. Zaremba appeared with most of the major symphony orchestras in this country, working with renowned conductors such as Leonard Bernstein, Eugene Ormandy, and Leopold Stokowski. Ms. Zaremba was trained at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, and she was an acclaimed teacher herself, serving for a number of years as the chairman of the keyboard department at the Ohio State University School of Music. She will be deeply missed. To her family we extend our heartfelt condolences. Bruce A. Stevens, President Peter B.
