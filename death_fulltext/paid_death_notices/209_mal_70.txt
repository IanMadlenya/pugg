        COLBURN--Richard D. The Trustees, Musicians and Staff of the Marlboro Music School and Festival mourn the loss of their devoted and generous Trustee and Trustee Emeritus, since 1979, and extend their deepest sympathy to his family. His goal, he often said, was to enjoy life to the fullest, and music was an integral part of that enjoyment. He, in turn, played a vital role in helping countless musicians and musical organizations, all of whom will miss him dearly.
