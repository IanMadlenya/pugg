        JAMES-Dennis. United Cerebral Palsy sadly acknowledges the sudden, untimely passing of Dennis James-friend and benefactor of and spokesman for the thousands of Americans with cerebral palsy. A pioneer in television in his own professional right, Dennis articulated the aspirations of people with cerebral palsy by hosting the UCP telethon since the inception of this television event in 1950. He traveled the country, establishing the telethon as an effective vehicle for the telling of the cerebral palsy story. His warm sense of commitment encouraged hundreds of American communities to organize and support the necessary program services vital to those with cerebral palsy. We extend to Micki, Dennis' three sons: Dennis Jr., Bradley and Randy our deepest loving condolences. Dennis distributed his caring heart abundantly and selflessly and will be forever missed. Jack Hausman, Founder Leo Hausman, President UCP/NYC
