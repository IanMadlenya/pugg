        KRAFT-Norman. On Feb. 21, 1998. Beloved and devoted husband of Diane. Father of Zina and Mark, father-in-law of Matthew and Shawna, grandfather of Alex, Jesse and Nicole, devoted brotherin-law, uncle and great uncle. Here was a man with a heart filled with the gift of love, the precious ability to share that love, a man with the character to truly and fully commit to others. Here was a man who brought joy to all who knew him. Through laughter and tears, there was always this man, Norman Kraft (Noach Tanchum Ben Aaron Yankov). Services will be held Tuesday, Feb. 24 at 12 noon, Schwartz Brothers Chapel, 114-03 Queens Blvd., Forest Hills, N.Y.
        KRAFT-Norman. My friend of more than 60 years, I miss him already. Humor, intellect, compassion and empathy were his hallmarks. Fiercely loyal to his family, his friends, and his people. Normie, thanks for the memories. Harold Zweighaft
