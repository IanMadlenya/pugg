        VERNON--Richard. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the untimely death of our dear friend and colleague, bass Richard Vernon, who sang 796 performances with our company. From the time of his Metropolitan debut in the premiere of ''Parade,'' on February 20, 1981, until his sudden death this past Friday, he remained an invaluable and beloved member of the company. We extend our sincerest condolences to his wife, Janine, his mother, Maizie, and all his family and friends. Peter Gelb, General Manager James Levine, Music Director
