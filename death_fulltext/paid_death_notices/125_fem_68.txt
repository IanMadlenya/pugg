        NEWSTADT-Mrs. Milicent (Penny) Brown, daughter of Judge Arthur and Helen Brown, now deceased, died on Sunday, June 8, on her 67th birthday following a short illness. Her husband David, children Tod and Tracy, and her best friend Peggy, were embracing her as she died peacefully. Penny lived in Danville, California at the time of her death. Many friends and neighbors tendered her loving care during her illness. Penny grew up in Woodbridge, NJ, and spend most of her life there, before moving to California with her husband in 1986. She graduated from Woodbridge High School, earned a BA degree from Syracuse University and an MA from Rutgers University. She then taught in Connecticut and Woodbridge Township schools. She was a good friend to many, but above all she was a self-effacing wife, mother, and grandmother, whose children and grandchild are her proud legacies. Services will be held on June 12 at the GreinerCostello Funeral Home, 44 Green Street, Woodbridge, NJ. Internment will follow at Beth Israel Cemetery in Woodbridge. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the American Cancer Society.
