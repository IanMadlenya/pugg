        ARIES-Peter L. You were an inspiration to me because you never gave up hope. Peter ''A'' was my devoted business partner for over ten years and my cherished friend forever. I will always remember the wonderful experiences we shared working together at Aries Brandenberg Company (ABC) as the Peters of ''A'' and ''D'' team. I will never forget you. Rest in peace, my friend. Love, Peter ''B'' Brandenberg
