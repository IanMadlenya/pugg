        HIRSCH-Francys. With profound sorrow, we announce the passing of our dear mother, grandmother and great-grandmother-Oma-who passed on peacefully in Netanya, Israel on October 17, 2000 at the age of 101. A Holocaust refugee, orphaned by the Nazis, Francys came to the United States in 1939 with her husband Julius and son Henry. She took great pleasure in Henry and daughter-in-law Renie, with her three grandchildren Mark, Jonathan and Daniel and with her eleven great-grandchildren. Oma always had a kind and an appropriate word for everyone, keeping her family together-while stressing a need for a belief in God and always maintaining deep religious commitment and observance. Oma kept her high spirits right through her very last breath. We will always cherish her memory and keep her love within us. The Hirsch family
