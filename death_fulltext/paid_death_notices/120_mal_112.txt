        McCourt - Dermott. It is with deep sorrow that we mourn the loss of Dermott McCourt, whose care of our family made such a difference in our lives and brightened countless days. His standards of excellence, dignity and wit improved us all. We shall miss him, but his decency and kindess are his legacy.  The Latcher Family
