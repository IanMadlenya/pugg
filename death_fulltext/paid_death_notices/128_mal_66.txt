        PRAGER-David. The Board of Directors and Faculty of the Diller Quaile School of Music mourns the recent passing of David Prager, who served as President of the Board during a critical time in Diller Quaile's history. Mr. Prager led the school through a period of substantial growth and in 1972 spearheaded the effort to purchase the school's building at 24 East 95th Street, thereby, assuring the future of the institution. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his wife Annabelle and his family.
