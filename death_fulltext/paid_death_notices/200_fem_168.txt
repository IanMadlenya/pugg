        MEYER--Frieda. Frieda, age 91, was reunited with her beloved husband and soulmate, Walter, on September 21. Originally from Cologne, Germany, she resided in Forest Hills, N.Y. and, of late, in Woodcliff Lake, N.J. She is deeply mourned by her cherished daughters Karen Rosenberg and June Blume and loving son-in-law Harry Rosenberg. She is the treasured Oma of Jennifer and Pamela Rosenberg, Mark (Erika) and Jonathan (Jessica) Blume and ur-oma of Harrison and Rachel Blume and sister-in-law to Lotte Meyer. Special thanks to her wonderful, compassionate caretaker, Christina Mensah and to Pat Taah who assisted Christina. Our Frieda was the most loving and gentle mother. She was a real lady in every way. A bright light has gone out. We already miss her terribly and will love her forever.
