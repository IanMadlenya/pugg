Blair, Jr., Baroness Edmond de Rothschild, the Hon. and Mrs. Douglas C. Dillon, The Hon. and Mrs. Evan G. Galbraith, Mrs. James M. Gavin, Mrs. Amory Houghton, The Hon. and Mrs. Arthur A. Houghton, Jr., Mrs. John N. Irwin, David Rockefeller, Laurance S. Rockefeller, the Hon. and Mrs. Sargent Shriver, Mrs. Stuart Symington and Mrs. Edward Wheeler. Mr. Van der Kemp was an extraordinarily charming, gifted, brave and noble person, ably supported by his loving wife, Florence Van der Kemp, who was highly effective in raising funds from American patrons for The Versailles Foundation and Giverny. A requiem mass will be held for invitees on January 28, at the Chapelle Royale at The Chateau de Versailles. The Versailles Foundation, Inc.
