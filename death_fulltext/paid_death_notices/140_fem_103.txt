        MASS - May. The Officers, Trustees, and staff of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations mourn the death of a precious friend and colleague. May's life was bound up with Reform Judaism.

We will miss her counsel, her caring concern, and her smile. We convey deepest sympathy to her children, Michael, Mindy, and Mark, their families, and all her loved ones. Jerome H.
