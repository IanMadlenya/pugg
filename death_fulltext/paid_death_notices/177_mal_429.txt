        BOVERS-Christopher Nugent, cofounder of Force Five Watersports and The Haul-Over outdoor stores in Nantucket, Massachusetts died suddenly on Sunday, October 28, 2001. He was 44 years old. He is survived by his wife Francie Ziminsky Bovers of Nantucket, Massachusetts; his sisters Kathleen Bovers of Bedford, NY, Heidi Johnston of Cross River, NY, and Hilary Finnegan, of Harvard, Massachusetts; and a brother Donald Bovers of New York City. Mr. Bovers was raised in Demarest, New Jersey, and later went to Cranwell School in Lenox, Massachusetts, and then to Boston College. He moved to Nantucket in 1978, and with his future wife Francie Ziminsky, founded Force Five Watersports, a surf shop and wind surfing store. In 1980, he worked for Mabon Nugent and Company as a Eurodollar Broker and in 1984 moved back to Nantucket full time. In 1995, he and his wife founded the Haul-Over, also located on Nantucket. He was a loving family man who was married 17 years as of September, 2001. His extended family included eleven brothers and sisters-in-law and 26 nieces and nephews whom he adored. An expert skier, fly fisherman, surfer, and wind surfer, Mr. Bovers helped teach thousands of visitors and islanders about his love of the ocean, fishing, and the mountains. A gregarious, fun-loving, larger-than-life figure, his generosity, soul, and love for Nantucket will be sorely missed. There will be a funeral mass on Wednesday, October 31 at 11:00 AM at St. Mary Our Lady of the Isle Roman Catholic Church in Nantucket, Massachusetts. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to Nantucket Ice, PO Box 3155, Nantucket, Massachusetts 02554.
