        VACCHIANO--William. The entire Juilliard community mourns the passing of William Vacchiano, one of the longest serving faculty members in the history of the School. He was a member of the trumpet faculty from 1935 to 2002, and his students went on to perform in most of the major orchestras around the world. A person of impeccable musical integrity and great humanity, he was revered and loved by his students and friends. We send our deepest condolences to his entire family. He will be deeply missed. Bruce Kovner, Chairman Joseph W. Polisi, President The Juilliard School
