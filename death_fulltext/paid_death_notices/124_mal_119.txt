        PORTER-Keith. The Rockefeller University mourns the passing of Keith Porter, who began his career at the university's predecessor, The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research. He left a 50year legacy of significant accomplishments as a pioneer of a new science, modern cell biology. His innovative methodology for the use of the electron microscope, design of the Porter-Blum microtome, and techniques for tissue culturing opened the field of cell biology by allowing much greater insight into the structure and function of cells. While at Rockefeller, Porter co-created the first electron micrograph of an intact cell, along with colleagues Albert Claude and Ernest Fullam. Also, with the aid of the electron microscope, Porter discovered the cell's endoplasmic reticulum, elucidated the structure of collagen fibers, cilia and microtubules, and defined the microtrabecular lattice. In addition, Mr. Porter was a founder and the organizer of the Tissue Culture Association (1946), the Journal of Cell Biology (1955), the premier journal in his field, and the American Society of Cell Biology (1961). Porter was a founding father of modern cell biology, along with two Rockefeller colleagues, Albert Claude and George Palade, who were honored with Nobel Prizes, an award that inexplicably eluded Porter.
