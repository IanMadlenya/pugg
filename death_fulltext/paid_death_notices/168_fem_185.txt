        ROMANOV-Princess Vera Constantinovna. The Board of Directors of the Russian Children's Welfare Society mourn the passing of Her Highness, Princess Vera of Russia, great-granddaughter of Tsar Nicholas I and second cousin of Tsar Nicholas II. We celebrate her life of serving people in need. For many years Princess Vera devotedly was a member of the Board of Directors and was the recording Secretary of the Society.
