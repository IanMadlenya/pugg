        WOLOHOJIAN--Jon Andrew. Of NYC and Saugerties, NY. July 26, 1961 to December 17, 2005. Beloved son of John and Anita. Cherished brother of Michael and Lucine, nephew of Florence, Rose and Gregory, cousin of Gabrielle, Stephan, Lauren and Eric. We will never forget his miraculous way of lighting up a room, of changing people's lives, of turning the antique cafe into a neighborhood haven. He will be remembered by his family and his wide community of adored friends for his vision, generous and free spirit, courage and radiance. Wake at St. Gregory the Illuminator Church, 1131 North St, White Plains, NY, 2 pm and 8 pm, Tuesday. Funeral service at church on Wednesday, at 11 am.
