        HOLLANDER-Elizabeth. Loving wife of the late Harry. Cherished sister of Helen. Adoring mother, grandmother and great-grandmother. She was so proud of all of them. An eternal optimist, she enriched the lives of all who knew her with her warmth and love. We, her nephew and sister-in-law will cherish the memories and will miss her dearly.
