        CHAYKIN--Irving, born August 16, 1912 to David and Dora Chaykin, accomplished a great many things in his 94 years. Some of his proudest achievements include a tremendous career in Accountancy education at City College, his alma mater, where he was continually voted by the Student Body as most popular Instructor and later named Professor Emeritus. In addition to his private practice as a CPA and his college teaching, he founded the Chaykin CPA Review Course in 1950, which was acquired by the Washington Post in 1990. His training resulted in generations of Accountants who attribute part of their success to Mr. Chaykin. Among many other honors, he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Hofstra University, a conference room in his name at Baruch College and a Townsend Harris Medal for exemplary contribution in the field of Accounting Education. In addition to his professional contributions, Mr. Chaykin was an active synagogue President and Board Member, and a generous philanthropist, recognized time and again with his wife Clarice for their support of Jewish causes. Together, they were honored by Israel Bonds, Hadassah and the Jewish Theological Seminary, among many other organizations over the years. His deepest source of pride, however, was his family, and it is there that his legacy will live on most profoundly. Clarice, his wife of 61 years, his children Dan and Jackie, Maury and Susannah and Debbie and Harvey, as well as his grandchildren Carla, Alex, Molly, David, Zoe and Rose remember him, even in this time of loss and sadness, with great warmth, admiration and laughter. He is remembered lovingly by all whose path he crossed for his quick wit, his kind and gentle nature and a full life lived with integrity and generosity always.
