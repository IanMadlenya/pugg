        OTTENHEIMER-Dr. Lilly. In loving memory of a most extraordinary, courageous and supremely civilized lady. She was a brilliant psychoanalyst who practiced with great artistry and affection, a model to her many patients and a mentor to generations of students. We shall miss her very much. June and Wally Davison
