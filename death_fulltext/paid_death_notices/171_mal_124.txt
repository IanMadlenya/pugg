        OAKES-John B. Clean Air Campaign mourns the loss of John Oakes. His unfailing integrity, courage and grace under fire will be sorely missed. His lucid columns inspired citizens fighting for a park along the Hudson River without environmentally damaging development in the waters of the river itself, and for the preservation of natural systems in all rivers, wetlands and coastal waters.
