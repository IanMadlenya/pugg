        EISENMAN-James A. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory extends its deepest sympathy to the family and friends of Jim Eisenman. Jim, an attorney of counsel to Payne, Wood and Littlejohn, was Director and Treasurer of the Long Island Biological Association at CSHL from 1963 to 1989. He will be deeply missed by all who knew him.
