        KLASS-Sholom, Rabbi. At the age of 83. The Board of Governing Rabbis and the Ecclesiastical Rabbinical Court of the Rabbinical Alliance of America-Igud Horabbonim-deeply mourns the passing of the Publisher and Editor of The Jewish Press, the largest AngloJewish circulation newspaper in the world. Rabbi Klass authored ''Responsa of Modern Judaism'' (3 volumes) and is considered to have been the greatest disseminator of Jewish learning in modern times. Rabbi Klass was the single most powerful voice of Jewish tradition in our times. His support for the State of Israel and for Orthodox Judaism was instrumental in formulating national and international policies. Rabbi Klass was a distinguished member of the Directorate of the Rabbinical Alliance. World Jewry lost one of its most powerful advocates. We extend our heartfelt condolence to the children, grandchildren and great grandchildren, and to the entire family. Rabbi Abraham B. Hecht, Pres. Rabbi Gershon Tannenbaum, Dir. Rabbinical Alliance of America
        KLASS-Sholom, Rabbi. The National Jewish Commission on Law and Public Affairs (COLPA) mourns the passing of Rabbi Sholom Klass, Publisher of ''The Jewish Press''. Rabbi Klass was a premier teacher of Torah, pioneer in Anglo-Jewish journalism and a passionate advocate for his people. He built the largest independent Anglo-Jewish weekly and dedicated it to the dissemination of Torah and enhancing the lives of Jews throughout the world. He was a giant who passed among us and we will not soon see his like again. Allen L. Rothenberg, President Dennis Rapps, Executive Director
