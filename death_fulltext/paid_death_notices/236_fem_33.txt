        Brown--Nancy Beth. Deeply loved wife of Russell Tims, mother of Travis Tims, sister of Alan Kornheiser and daughter of Bernice and Stanley Kornheiser. Peacefully, after a long illness, surrounded by family, on September 4. In Santa Fe, where she lived for 30 years as the city's brilliant jeweler, mourned by innumerable friends all warmed by her love and goodness. ''There's no life that couldn't be immortal if only for a moment.''
