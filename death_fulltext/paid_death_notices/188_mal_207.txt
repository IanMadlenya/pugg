        STERN-Isaac. The Carnegie Hall family will never forget our Founder and President, Isaac Stern, for his humanity, his music and his heroic rescue of Carnegie Hall from the wrecker's ball. Countless lives have been touched by his music, energy, passion, and humor, for to be in his presence was to breathe a different atmosphere. He was an inspiration-as a musician, as a leader, as a friend and colleague. Words cannot express how deeply he has been missed over the past year, here on 57th Street and around the world.
