        LATTES--Raffaele. The faculty, staff and students of Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons are saddened by the passing of Raffaele Lattes, M.D. Prof. Emeritus of Pathology. Dr. Lattes was born in Turin, Italy in 1910 and received his M.D. degree there in 1933. Following the enactment of racial laws in Italy he came to the U.S. in 1940 and joined the Columbia Faculty in 1943. He received a Doctor of Medical Science degree from Columbia in 1946. Dr. Lattes served as Prof. of Surgery and then as Prof. of Surgical Pathology at Columbia and continued to serve for many years after his formal retirement in 1978 before returning to Italy in 1998. Dr. Lattes was one of the foremost experts in surgical pathology of his generation and the mentor for many of todays leaders in the field. His work on the pathology of soft tissue tumors contributed immensely to our scientific knowledge and treatment of human cancers. We extend our deepest sympathy to his family and friends. The family requests that memorials be contributed to the Conrad G. Lattes Scholarship Fund at Columbia University. Kathleen O'Toole, M.D., Director, Surgical Pathology Michael L.
