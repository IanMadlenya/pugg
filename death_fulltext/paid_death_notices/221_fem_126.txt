        EWESON--Dorothy Dillon. Barnard College mourns its devoted alumna, Dorothy Dillon Eweson, member of the Class of 1950 and Trustee from 1958 to 1962 and again from 1965 to 1976. Mrs. Eweson generously supported the College during her lifetime, establishing funds for faculty support and development, and contributed her time selflessly as a Trustee. The Board of Trustees extends its deepest sympathy to her family. Anna Quindlen '74, Chair Board of Trustees Judith R. Shapiro, President
