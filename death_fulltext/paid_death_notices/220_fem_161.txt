        MORGAN -- Claudia Bur ghardt. July 23rd, 1939-April 14th, 2005. A graduate of the Bronx High School of Science, she earned a BA from Harvard in 1961, and an MA in Urban Planning, 1965, University of Cincinnati. Her career in urban planning was cut short by her increasing disability from multiple sclerosis. Subsequent volunteer work included the Jacob Perlow Hospice at Beth Israel Medical Center, the MTA Committee for Disability Transport, the NYC Harvard Admissions Committee, and the Community College Chorus of CCNY. She impressed all with her courage and commitment to focus on her abilities, not her disabilities. She completed the 2000 NYC Marathon in a wheelchair. Survivors in sorrow include husband, John P. Morgan, M.D.; children, Jennifer Lyle Morgan and Zachary Ross Morgan; son-in-law, Herman L. Bennett; mother, Ethel Carter; grandchildren, Carl J. Fraley and Emma Lee Morgan-Bennett; aunt and uncle, E.G. and Teena Spaulding; cousin, Kenneth Spaulding, M.D.; and loving caregiver of 20 years, Willie Mae Bryant. A memorial service will take place on Saturday, May 21st, at 2 PM, at the NYC Riverside Church. Donations may be made in her name to support stem cell or multiple sclerosis research at Mt. Sinai Medical Center (212-659-8500).
