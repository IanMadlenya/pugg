        CONVISSOR-Carole. On behalf of the Trustees and staff of The Marilyn Horne Foundation, I wish to express our deep sorrow at the passing of Carole Convissor. As Director of Special Projects at The Juilliard School, she was a good friend to us, assisting in immeasurable ways in our collaboration with the School. Our condolences to her family and to all of her friends and colleagues whose lives were touched by her thoughtful and nurturing spirit. Marilyn Horne
