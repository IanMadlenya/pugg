        FRIED-Brita D. (Mrs. Walter). The Board of Trustees, Medical Staff and Administration of the Hospital for Special Surgery mourn with profound sorrow the death of Mrs. Walter J. Fried, a most generous and dedicated Trustee. As a member of the Board for over 30 years, she served on the Nursing, Benefit and Planning Committees. Mrs. Fried was the first female Trustee representative to the HSS Medical Board and its Institutional Review Board. Her association with the hospital began in 1957 when she became a hospital volunteer and a leader of the HSS Women's Auxiliary. She was a great humanitarian to whom generations of patients owe deep gratitude. She will be greatly missed and fondly remembered. We extend our deepest sympathy to all members of her bereaved family. Richard L. Menschel, Chairman Aldo Papone, Co-Chairman Board of Trustees Russell F. Warren, M.D., Surgeon-in-Chief Stephen A. Paget, M.D., Physician-in-Chief Philip D. Wilson, Jr., M.D., Surgeon-in-Chief Emeritus John R. Reynolds, President & CEO
