        PARK-Leo. 1975-1999. Loving son and brother. Friend to all. His great compassion, his kindness and his smile will never be forgotten. He brought out the best in all of us. Leo, a place will always be saved for you at our table, at the game, and in our hearts. You showed us the joy of life, and blessed us all. We miss you. John, Mom and Dad, Your dear friends
        PARK-Leo H. The brothers of Theta Delta Chi, members of the Dartmouth College Community, and all of his friends mourn the loss of Leo Park and offer our deepest sympathies to his loving family.
