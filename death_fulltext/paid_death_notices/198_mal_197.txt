        LEWIS--Harold. The Board of the Lois and Samuel Silberman Fund is deeply saddened by the passing of Dr. Harold Lewis. We were privileged to have been the beneficiaries of his insight, creativity and wit for more than 30 years. Dr. Lewis was a dynamic force in the development of professional social work education, and though his contributions are lasting, the field has lost a true scholar and invaluable friend. We extend our condolences to his wife Celia and their two daughters, Amy and Beth. Anne P. Sidamon-Eristoff, Chairman Jayne M. Silberman, Vice Chairman Lois V. Silberman, Trustee Emerita
        LEWIS -- Harold. Creative scholar, inspiring leader, brilliant educator, daring innovator, tireless fighter for justice, devoted husband, father and grandfather, beloved mentor and friend.
