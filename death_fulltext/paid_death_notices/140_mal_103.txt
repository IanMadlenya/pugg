        O'DONNELL-Kirk. Formed a decade ago by a bi-partison group of New Yorkers, the ''Kirk O'Donnell Breakfast Club'' met regularly under his tutelage to hear a crosssection of views from Washington. Kirk was our mentor and guide to the mysteries and intricacies of American politics and government. He made politics and policy accessible and meaningful, and always joyous. We will miss his wit and wisdom, his twinkle and laugh, and his love of his noble craft of which he was one of our generation's most accomplished craftsmen. We were blessed to have learned from him. Our condolences to Kathryn, Holly and Brendan. Jay L. Kriegel, Chairman Robert E. Rubin, Tom Tisch, Vice Chairmen
