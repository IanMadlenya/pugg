        GELBARD-Bruce. Friends and colleagues at the Board of Education mourn the sad and premature passing of Bruce, former Secretary of the Board, and Chief Administrator of the Impartial Hearing Office. Eash of us has very special memories of a very special person. Deepest sympathy to his wife Leila, his step-daughter Debra, his parnets, David and Jean, his sister Trudy and brother Mark.
