        BERNSTEIN-Maurice. The Hebrew Orphan Asylum Association mourns the loss of one of its most beloved members, Maurice Bernstein, who died on February 10th at 95. He had been admitted to the HOA during WW I, having lost both parents. The HOA gave him a college scholarship, sent him to social work school, gave him a job at the home & eventually promoted him to Director. He was the second HOA alumus promoted to that position. After the HOA closed in 1941, Maurice become the alumni association's guiding heart and soul for the next 60 years. The association's monthly publication, The Rising Bell, was named for an HOA literary magazine Maurice had helped start. It's name referred to the First Bell every morning that awaken 10 dormatories of sleeping children. Maurice's death has left us all with feelings of profound loss. He was irreplaceable. Hyman Bogen, Pres. HOA Assoc.
