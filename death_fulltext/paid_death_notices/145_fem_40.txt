        MAX-Pearl Bernstein. The City University of New York deeply mourns the passing of Pearl Bernstein Max, the first Administrative Director of the Board of Higher Education, appointed in 1938, whose brilliant leadership and visionary thinking helped guide New York City's four-college municipal college system to become the City University of New York in 1961. Among her many accomplishments in over three decades of exemplary service, she proposed the funding formula for CUNY; drafted the first Master Plan; founded and was first Coordinator of the Office of Institutional Research in 1967; and conducted seminal studies of retention, teacher education and admissions procedures. She will be sorely missed. We offer our most sincere condolences to her family. Anne A. Paolucci, Chairwoman Board of Trustess Christoph M. Kimmich, Interim Chancellor
