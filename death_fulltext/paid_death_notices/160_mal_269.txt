        OSHINSKY-Elihu, on May 18 in New Brunswick, N.J., at age 92. Beloved husband of the late Sophie; devoted father of Stephen and David and daughters-in-law Carolyn and Jane; loving grandfather of Joshua, Allison, Sarah, Matthew, Efrem, and Ari. A school teacher and principal in New York City for forty years, he was deeply respected as an educator with a passionate commitment to his students. In the 1960s his fervent defense of First Amendment freedoms led the U.S. Supreme Court to affirm the ban on ''voluntary'' prayers in the nation's public schools. To his family, he was simply ''poppy,'' a sweet, principled, generous man who showered us with affection while acting as our patriarch and moral guide. Rest in peace, poppy. You will always be in our hearts.
