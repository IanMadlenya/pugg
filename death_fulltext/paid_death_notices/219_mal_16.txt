        WAGNER -- Rodney. World Wildlife Fund mourns the loss of our long time board member and dear friend, Rodney Wagner. He has been mentor, colleague and a stalwart and insightful supporter of WWF for almost 20 years. He was a thoughtful, quiet, yet forceful advocate for the environment and promoted creative financial solutions to the world's environmental challenges, including conceiving the innovative debt for nature trades which have been used to raise the priority and lower the cost of conservation in developing countries. His wisdom, kindness & commitment to safeguarding our planet for the benefit of wildlife and humans alike will be deeply missed. William K. Reilly, Chairman Kathryn S. Fuller, President and CEO World Wildlife Fund
