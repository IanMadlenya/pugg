        KEESING--Gustaaf, D.D.S., of Rye, NY, passed away on March 25, 2007, surrounded by his wife and family. Born in Amsterdam, the Netherlands in 1913, 50-year resident of Scarsdale, NY, he received his dental degrees from both the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands, as well as the University of Pennsylvania. He is survived by his cherished childhood neighbor and adoring wife of 67 years, Aleida van Tijn, his loving children Bette Sparago and Andrew (Linda), grandsons Daniel and Jeffrey Keesing, and his sister Henrietta van Voolen. His passions, beyond his devotion to his family, included his international dental practice, where his fluency in several foreign languages, enabled him to care for dignitaries from foreign governments and the United Nations during and after World War II. As a lover of the arts, he traveled the world, sharing his interests with his wife and family always at his side. Private funeral. In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to the American Lung Association, 61 Broadway, NY, NY 10006.
