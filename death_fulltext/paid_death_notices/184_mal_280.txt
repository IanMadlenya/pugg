        LORD-Walter. Walter was a founding trustee of the Ocean Liner Museum. Historian par excellence, wise colleague and beloved friend, Walter will be sorely missed by all who served with him. His long suffering from the Parkinson's disease that killed him was endured with extraordinary patience and uncommon grace. The officers, trustees and members of the Ocean Liner Museum of New York lament his passing.
