        SINGER--Nell. The officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn with profound sadness the passing of Nell Singer, a cherished leader of the Jewish community and an esteemed philanthropist. Nell and her beloved late husband, Herbert, shared a historic commitment to the Jewish community which was symbolized by their generous support of UJA-Federation and our network of agencies, as well as co-founding the Jewish Communal Fund. In addition, their dedication to healthcare and other humanitarian causes were an expression of their passion and boundless generosity. Nell & Herbert's devotion was fueled by an overwhelming dedication to tikkun olam, enriching the lives of millions in New York, in Israel, and around the world. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Nell's sons, Peter L. Singer and Soul Singh Khalsa, and to the entire family. Morris W. Offit, President Susan K. Stern, Chair of the Board John S. Ruskay, Exec. V.P. & C.E.O.
