        BEER-Laura H. Died September 22, 2000. She lived a mindful, simple life in the West Village. She was a social worker who respected the wisdom of her clients, a gospel chorus member who offered her voice joyfully with her peers, a mother who loved and dazzled her children and a citizen with a daily commitment to living ethically and lovingly as a member of her community. She loved scholarship that affected people's lives, nature that was available to everyone and grassroots political efforts. She is survived by her children Elizabeth and Andrew, their spouses Kevin and Eleanor, her grandchildren Nuala, Orla, Tea and India and many loving friends and extended family. We are left poorer from her loss, but are grateful to have loved her mind, humor, gaze, gestures, generosity and courage while she was here. She moved us all in gentle and radical ways and we will miss her every day. A memorial will be held Wednesday, October 4, at The Boat House in Central Park at 9:30 AM.
