        BAER-Rudolf L. The entire community of the New York University Medical Center deeply mourns the passing of our reknowned colleague, Dr. Rudolf Baer, an outstanding member of the faculty of the NYU School of Medicine for 55 years. He was the epitomy of a gentleman and a scholar. A most beloved Chairman of the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology for over 20 years. During his tenure as Chairman, the Department developed to be the leading academic and clinical dermatology service in the US. Through his productivity, he set the direction of modern research in dermatology. As a physician/ scientist, he influenced the training of an entire generation of young dermatologists in cell biology, biochemistry and immunology. A whole new era of clinical investigation was developed by his efforts. He received numerous awards, honors and citations and was elected to the highest offices by his colleagues nationally and internationally. Every major dermatological society benefitted from his wisdom and clinical acumen. Dr. Baer was respected and admired by his peers throughout the world. A gentle and wise man who became a role model as a physician, spouse, father, grandfather and brother. A mentor to all who knew him. He was a constant presence at NYU until the last days of his life. He and his beloved late spouse, Louise, were loved and highly respected by all of us at NYU and in many places around the world. It was tragic to learn of the passing of his devoted son, Andrew during the same week of his own death. He will indeed be forever remembered by his colleagues and peers everywhere. We offer our deep condolences to his son John and the entire family. Lawrence A. Tisch, Chairman NYU Board of Trustees L. Jay Oliva, President NYU E.
