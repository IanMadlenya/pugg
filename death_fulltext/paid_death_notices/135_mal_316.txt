        GOLDIN-Harry, M.D. The President and Board of Trustees of Montefiore Medical Center mourn the passing of Dr. Harry Goldin, a venerable clinician of extraordinary devotion to his profession. A 1924 graduate of Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons who went on to specialize in gastroenterology, Dr. Goldin came to Montefiore nearly 50 years ago and remained actively engaged in the life of the medical center well into his 100th year. We shall miss his wisdom, his gentlemanly manner, and his active encouragement of younger colleagues. Our heartfelt condolences are extended to his children and entire family. Spencer Foreman, M.D., Pres. Jay B. Langner, Chairman Board of Trustees Montefiore Medical Center
