        BRENNAN-William J. The Brennan Center for Justice at NYU and the NYU Law School community mourn the loss of Justice Brennan, our hero, inspiration, Honorary Chair, teacher, defender, and faithful friend. He devoted his life to fighting for our freedom, our dignity, and our equality. We will work to honor his legacy in perpetuity by continuing the fight, hopefully with the grace, love, charm, and compassion that defined him. E. Joshua Rosenkranz, Exec. Dir.
