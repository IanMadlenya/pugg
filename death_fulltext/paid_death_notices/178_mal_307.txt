        HEILBRUNN-Robert H. The Long Island University family is saddened by the loss of Robert Heilbrunn, a true friend, honorary alumnus and recipient of the University's highest tribute, an honorary doctorate. Together with his beloved wife Harriet, Bob embraced our vision of access and excellence in higher education and shared his good fortune by establishing endowed scholarships for countless students, so that they, too, would have an opportunity to seek the American dream. His heart had no boundaries and will touch lives for generations to come. We extend our condolences and sympathy to Harriet, our alumna, to his daughters, Helaine and Joan, to his sons-in-law, Sidney and Robert, and to his grandchildren and great-grandson. David J. Steinberg, President
