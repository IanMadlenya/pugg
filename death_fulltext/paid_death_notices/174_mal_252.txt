        HENKIN-Mal. Passed on July 11, 2001. Mal was an extraordinary man as he lived an ordinary life. He was brilliantly creative, honest, warm and had certain qualities which were modeled by those who knew him. With a deep baritone voice, long body and kind heart. He was father to Mark and Jon, grandfather, husband and friend. To those of us who loved him, he did not live nearly long enough. We miss him now and forever. Michael
