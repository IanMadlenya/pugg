        FEIND-Carl R., MD. The Columbia University Department of Surgery mourns the loss of our esteemed colleague, Dr. Carl Feind, Professor Emeritus of Clinical Surgery and Special Lecturer in Surgery at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. Following his graduation from P&S in 1950, he completed his internship and residency in this Department, and remained here for his entire career. He earned international renown for his outstanding scholarly contributions to the fields of head and neck, thyroid, and parathyroid surgery. He was beloved by his patients and colleagues, and by scores of students who knew him as both mentor and friend. We extend sincere condolences to his wife, Helen, and to his children, Carl Feind, Jr., MD, LeeAnn Mondloch, Ellen Sanford, and Susan Kelly, and 10 grandchildren. A memorial service will be held on Friday, March 1, 4:00 PM, Presbyterian Hospital Chapel, 622 W. 168 St. Donations may be made to the Feind Research Fund, Department of Surgery, Columbia University, 177 Fort Washington Ave., NY, NY 10032.
