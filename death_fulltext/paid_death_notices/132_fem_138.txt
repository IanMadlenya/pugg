        RUBINOFF - Lillian. Women's League for Conservative Judaism mourns the loss of Lillian (Billie) Rubinoff, a dynamic and devoted member. She was mentor to generations of leaders as a National Vice President, Parliamentarian, member of our Executive Committee, and honorary National Board member. Beloved by the members of Philadelphia Branch and Southern New Jersey Branch, of which she was the founding President, she will be missed by all who benefited from her wise counsel, warm humor and caring ways.
