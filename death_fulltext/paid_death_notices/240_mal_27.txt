        STANTON--Frank. For many years, President of CBS who risked contempt of Congress for the freedom of the television press. In 1971, a CBS News program Selling of the Pentagon exposed an unauthorized Pentagon public relations campaign for the Vietnam War. A Congressional Committee subpoenaed Stanton to produce program outtakes for their investigation of CBS News editorial judgment. President Nixon backed the Committee. As journalists know, such government hearings can deter reporting of news to inform the public, particularly about government misconduct. They also scare away news sources. Stanton appeared but would not produce material nor testify about news judgments, asserting the First Amendment. The Committee moved for contempt of Congress to jail Stanton, fine CBS and threaten its broadcast licenses. Journalists, stations, newspapers, NBC and other broadcasters rallied to Stanton. Minority Leader Gerald Ford led Republicans to join those Democratic members who no longer supported their Committee. The vote for contempt failed. Television news gained its freedom from such Congressional hearings. We all are beneficiaries of Stanton's courage and his fight for First Amendment protection for television news. Corydon B. Dunham Esq., Former Executive Vice President and General Counsel, NBC; Counsel, Cahill Gordon and Reindel.
