        LASOFF--Gladys. The splendid legacy of her journey among us prompts a generous borrowing from Shakespeare's JULIUS CAESAR: ''Her life was gentle, and the elements so mixed in her that nature might stand up and say to all the world, ''This, indeed, was a Woman!'' Surfaced from early leadership ranks in our dedicated Family Association, Gladys swiftly took center stage in the life of Daytop's Board of Trustees over two decades. Her footprints remain engraved upon our mission. Prayerful support for her beloved Gustave and the Lasoff Family. William B. O'Brien President, Daytop Village, Inc.
