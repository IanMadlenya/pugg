        BEN-HAIM--Rabbi Baruch. The Yeshivah of Flatbush mourns the passing of beloved rabbi and pillar of the Brooklyn and New Jersey Sephardic communities Hacham Baruch Ben-Haim. Hacham Baruch served as Chief Rabbi of the community, and was the son-in-law of Chief Rabbi Yaakov Kassin, A''H. A man of strong principles and unparalleled scholarship, Hacham Baruch's advice was sought by rabbis throughout the U.S. and Israel. Nevertheless, some of his greatest satisfaction came from teaching youngsters in local yeshivot. His passing is a great loss to his family, to the Yeshivah of Flatbush family, whose parents and children looked to him for guidance and inspiration, to his community and to Klal Yisrael. Our condolences go to his wife, Charlotte, and his four sons, Eli, Yaakov, Yehuda, and David and their families. May they be comforted from Heaven. Tenuhamu min Hashamayim. Jack A. Rahmey, President and the entire Yeshivah of Flatbush family
