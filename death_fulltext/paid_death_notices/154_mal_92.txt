        GREENWALD-Harold. The Partners, Counsel, Associates and Staff of Bangser Klein Rocca & Blum are deeply saddened by the death of our dear friend, counsel, and former partner. He was a soft spoken, unfailingly courteous man. We will sorely miss his intellect, integrity and ethical standards. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to his family.
