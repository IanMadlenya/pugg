        HANSEN--Stanley .... and the Lord cried out to his flock, ''I need a master framer, who can also cut a lot of mat openings.'' There was a great deal of murmuring ... then two voices were heard, ''Lord, get Stanley Hansen.'' The Lord said, ''who spoke?'' ''I am Sylvan Cole and this is Arthur Brown. Stanley worked for me at Associated American Artists.'' Arthur Brown said, ''Stanley was the best mat cutter Arthur Brown & Bro. ever had. He's been doing his job for sixty years.'' The Lord said, ''Stanley, I need you this week.'' Stanley said, ''Dot, I got to go, I have a big job and they need me.'' Peter A. Brown
