        STEIN--Felice. Her dear family and many friends are saddened by her passing on August 19, 2005, in her home. Felice, beloved wife of the late Aaron, a lover of life and family, battled cancer for eighteen years with courage and optimism. She is survived by her daughter, Carla Stein Duby and her children Sara, Caitlyn and Zachary; her son Freeman Stein, his wife Wendy and their children Mikail and Gabriel, her brother Howard Kaplan, his wife Trudy; her sister-in-law Leah Kaplan; and an extended family of nieces, nephews and cousins. She placed others before herself even at her time of greatest need. We love you Mom, Fagel, Bubbe, and will miss you. Services will be held at 2pm on Monday, August 22, 2005, at ''The Riverside,'' 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue.
