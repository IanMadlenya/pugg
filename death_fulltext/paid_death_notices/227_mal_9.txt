        YOUNG--Nicholas. The Members of The New York Psychoanalytic Society and Institute mourn the loss of their colleague, Dr. Nicholas Young. He was instrumental in the Education Program of the Institute, a highly esteemed teacher and a mentor to many of our present members. His wise counsel and wry humor will be sorely missed. Our condolences to his wife, our member, Dr. Marianne Young, and his stepsons and family. Paul Rosenbaum, M.D., Pres.
