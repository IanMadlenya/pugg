        $(6$)HIRSCHHORN--David. American Associates, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev deeply mourns the passing of David Hirschhorn. David was a passionate and loyal supporter of Ben-Gurion University for nearly 30 years. As family spokesman and president of the Jacob and Hilda Blaustein Foundation, he nurtured the special relationship between the Blaustein family and BGU's world-renowned Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research. In 1994, David received an honorary doctorate from BGU for his commitment and devotion to the University and to the development of the Negev. The support from this distinguished family has greatly impacted BGU's desert reclamation programs being implemented today in more than 40 countries. David's vision and passion will be sorely missed, but his legacy continues. We extend our profound condolences to his wife Barbara and his entire family. Carol D. Saal, President Amos Drory, Executive Vice President
