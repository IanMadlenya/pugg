        WACHTEL-Lucy. The Diller-Quaile School of Music notes with saddness the death of former faculty member Lucy Wachtel. Lucy taught piano for many years and was also a founder and fundraiser for an expanded Outreach Program, which offers private and class instruction to children from Daycare Centers in Harlem and East Harlem. We regret the passing of a deeply committed friend and extend our warmest sympaties to her family.
