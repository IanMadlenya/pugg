        ANGELO-Frank. God's Love We Deliver honors the memory of our friend Frank Angelo, who died on Jan. 12. Frank was a co-founder of MAC Cosmetics, and an extraordinary supporter of God's Love We Deliver's free meal delivery service for homebound people with AIDS. He will long be remembered for the creation of the MAC AIDS Fund-a model of responsive corporate leadership-and for his passionate commitment to the fight against AIDS.
