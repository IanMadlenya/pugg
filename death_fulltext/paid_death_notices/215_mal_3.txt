        GOLD--Morris, 85, after a long battle with Alzheimer's Disease, has finally found serenity and peace when he passed away Monday, November 29th. He was surrounded by his family who loved him so much & whom he loved so much. Morris was one of the Founders of the 5 generation family business, Gold's Horseradish and was also known for his love of magic. His love of Horseradish & Magic pales in comparison to the love he had for and the pride he derived from his family. Morris will be lovingly remembered by his wife, Norma of 58 years, his sons & daughters-in-law, Marc & Rosalie, Steven & Terri, & Jason & Margi, as well as his adoring grandchildren Fara, 26, Melissa, 24, Taryn, 23, Scott, 20, Kevin, 17, & Shawn, 13, who thank their grandfather for sundaes on Mondays, weekend boat rides, and for teaching them to always believe in magic. Please make donations to: Long Island Alzheimer's Association, 3281 Veterans Memorial Highway, Suite E-13, Ronkonkoma, NY 11779.
