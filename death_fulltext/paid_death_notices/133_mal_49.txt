        CASSILLY-Richard. New York City Opera mourns the passing of a good friend and coleague, Richard Cassilly. He joined the City Opera in 1955, and over the years provided us with many memorable evenings in the theater. He has been a continuing supporter of our company, a caring friend and colleague to his fellow artists, and a dedicated teacher and mentor to his many students. We extend our deepest sympathy to his family and his many friends. He will be missed. Paul Kellogg General Director
