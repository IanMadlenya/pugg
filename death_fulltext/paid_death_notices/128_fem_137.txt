        LOOKSTEIN-Gertrude. American Friends of Yeshivot Bnei Akiva records with deep sorrow the passing of Gertrude Lookstein, a true Eishet Chayil who devoted her life to the Jewish People, the Torah and the Land of Israel. We extend deepest condolences to her son, Rabbi Haskel Lookstein, a dedicated supporter of AFYBA and recipient of its Rabbinic Leadership Award, and a true religious Zionist leader. May the family be consoled among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Marvin S. Bienenfeld, Chairman Joel M. Schreiber, President Rabbi David V. Warshaw, Ex. Dir.
        LOOKSTEIN-Gertrude S. A devoted friend, always kinds and generous in times of need. May her family be comforted by her gracious memory. Mrs. Dezso Goldner
        LOOKSTEIN-Gertrude. Goodbye to a wonderful woman whose warmth and high standards will continue to inspire. Ruth and Ed Lukashok
