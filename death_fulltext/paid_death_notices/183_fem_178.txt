        LOTZOF-Sadie. The Board of Directors and staff of UJA-Federation of New York note with sadness the passing of Sadie Lotzof. Sadie was the beloved mother of Lorraine Abramson and motherin-law of Richard Abramson, cherished friends, supporters, and leaders of our mission, who are devoted to maintaining a strong and vital Jewish community on Long Island, in New York, and throughout the world. We extend our deepest sympathies to Sadie's husband, David, and to her sister, Becky, and to Lorraine and Richard, and Lorraine's brother and sister-in-law, Selwin and Trish Lotzof, and to Sadie's grandchildren and great-grandchildren. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Larry Zicklin, President Morris W. Offit, Board Chair Erika Witover, LI Chair John S. Ruskay, Exec VP & CEO Stuart Tauber, LI Regional Dir.
