        QUACKENBUSH - Christopher. The entire NYU Law School family mourns the loss of our trustee and friend, Chris Quackenbush, a victim of the World Trade Center tragedy. Chris was a special person who combined high values with the ability to inspire others to act for the good. He was a wise businesssman and counselor to the great; but still more, he was an example of the finest qualities a person can possess. Even as we use him as a model for our students, we mourn his loss and dedicate ourselves to keeping his spirit alive. Our thoughts, prayers and love are with his wife (Traci), his children (Whitney, C.J., Kelsey) and his entire family. Lester Pollack, Chair John Sexton, Dean New York University School of Law
