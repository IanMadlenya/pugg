        REINHARDT-Alfred N., age 89. Beloved father, grandfather and great-grandfather, died at his home on May 11th in Miami Beach, Florida, where he has resided for the past seven years with his partner, Ruth Durlacher. He was a seeker and, at the age of 17, came to the U.S., where eventually he became a fine photographer and a skilled boatsman. Until his retirement he was co-owner of the Astoria Photo Service in Queens, Commander in the Great Neck Power Squadron and Commodore of the Sands Point Yacht Club. He was a widower of Flora Reinhardt and is survived by two daughters and sons-in-law, Joan and Mark Reiss of San Francisco, and Joyce and Irwin Spiegel of Lawrenceville, New Jersey; four grandchildren, Felice Ciccione, Warren Kudman, Craig Reiss, and Justine Reiss; and five great-grandchildren. In lieu of flowers, please send contributions in his memory to the hospice, Vitas Healthcare Corp., 3700 Executive Way, Miramar, Florida 33025.
