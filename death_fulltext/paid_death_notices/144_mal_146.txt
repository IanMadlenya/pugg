        BLECHMAN-Burt. Age 71. On December 29, 1998 in Providence, Rhode Island of pancreatic cancer. Survived by his mother, Mae and brother, R.O. Blechman; nephews, Nicholas and Max; and companion John Marsh. His first novel, ''How Much'' was adapted by Lillian Hellman for Broadway, and praised by Alfred Kazan as ''a book that comes off with painful power ...inimitable.'' Critically acclaimed by W.H. Auden, Anita Loos, and Susan Sontag, he subsequently wrote four novels, ''The War Of Camp Omongo,'' ''Maybe,'' ''Stations,'' and ''The Octopus Papers.'' ''Turn Off The Television Awhile,'' wrote Saul Bellow, ''and for the sake of your souls, read Burt Blechman.'' A generous contributor to The Yivo Institute for Jewish Research and the Pearl Theatre, he was a brilliant conversationalist and wit. He will be sorely missed by family and friends.
