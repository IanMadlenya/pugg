        THROOP-William M. Jr. (''Pete''). The partners, associates and staff of Davidson, Dawson & Clark, LLP mourn the death of our distinguished and much beloved former Sr Partner on June 20, 2002. He practiced law with this firm for over 50 years and for almost half of that time was our leader in every respect. He was a brilliant and sensitive lawyer and a wise counsellor to his and our many individual and institutional clients. We will miss his sage and generous leadership and extend our deepest sympathies to his wife Ann and their family.
