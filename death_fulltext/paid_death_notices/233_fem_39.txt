        SOKOL--Margaret. The Advisory Council of the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art, Cornell University, deeply mourns the passing of Margaret Sokol, a distinguished collector, donor, and friend. A lover of art, both Asian and western, Mrs. Sokol was a dedicated museum docent, profoundly interested in education in the arts. All her friends at the Museum will miss her keen intelligence and quiet humor.
