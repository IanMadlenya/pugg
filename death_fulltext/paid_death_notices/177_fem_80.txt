        REOPELL-Ola Smith. Of Royalston, MA, on October 6, 2001 at age 77 at Brigham-Women's Hospital, Boston. Beloved wife of William R. Reopell, she was a native of Arkansas who became a loyal Wall Streeter and a quintessential ''New Yorker''. She loved the City for its art, theatre, music and especially opera. She will be buried in her native Ozark foothills in the Spring, when the dogwoods are in bloom, a sight she treasured as much as the lights of Broadway.
