        BERNSTEIN-Irving. I was deeply saddened to learn of the untimely passing of my dear friend Irving Bernstein. This marks the end of an era of great Jewish leaders. Since 1946, Irving worked tirelessly, devoting his life to ensuring the welfare and survival of the Jewish people. I had the privilege of knowing and working with Irving throughout his years working with the United Jewish Appeal and for other causes. Irving was one of a kind. It will be a long time before there will be another one like him. My wife Jean and I send our heartfelt sympathies to Judith and the family. Sam Rothberg
