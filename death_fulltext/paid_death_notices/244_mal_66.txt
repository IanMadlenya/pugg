        WADLER--Scott M.D. The Board of Directors of the Cancer Research and Treatment Fund mourns the death of Dr. Scott Wadler. Dr. Wadler was a member of our Medical Advisory Board and the first occupant of the Richard T. Silver Distinguished Professorship of Hematology and Medical Oncology at Weill Cornell Medical College. He was an earnest friend who was always willing to share his medical expertise and he had a talent for explanation for those with questions. In his life work, he gave encouragement and understanding through his support and participation in educational and research opportunities that addressed the needs of all people with cancer. A brilliant physician, he was taken too soon from his colleagues, friends and family who will miss his smile, compassion and easy way with words. Richard J. Rose, President Richard T.
