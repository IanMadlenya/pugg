The Jewish Theological Seminary family records with sorrow the death of Lori Kaplan, beloved daughter of Tobee and Leonard Kaplan, passionate Conservative Jews who have put philanthrophy and love of Judaism in the center of their family life. Our hearts go out to them, Lori's sister and brothers and the entire family. May her memory be for a blessing. Ismar Schorsch, Chancellor Gershon Kekst, Chairman
