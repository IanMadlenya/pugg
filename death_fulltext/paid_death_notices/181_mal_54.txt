        GABRESKI-Col. Francis. The Polish American Congress mourns the death of our great American hero, ''Gabby.'' The top US fighter pilot in Europe, he also flew with the Polish Squadron of the RAF. He was a proud and loyal American; a true Pole; a devout Catholic. As we grieve and reflect on his remarkable war record, we also remember the contribution of all Polish Americans to freedom's victory over Nazi Germany.
