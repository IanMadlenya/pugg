        CIMBERG - Alan. ''Grandpa Pookie'' to family and friends, died in his sleep at home on October 21, 2001. Beloved husband of Freda for 64 years. Loving father of Janice Cimberg and the late Dr. Robert Cimberg. Adored grandfather of Jonathan Fried, his wife, Sharon Greenberger, and Andrew Fried. Devoted great-grandfather of Madelyn and Josie. The youngest of seven children, Alan was born on the Lower East Side on January 1, 1911, and in his 90th year was still working as a professional speaker, giving courses on sales motivation. Alan was one of Dale Carnegie's earliest students and this experience and his training as a instructor in Carnegie's method sparked a lifelong interest in speaking and selling. Alan worked for 20 years as a salesman with The Borg/Warner Company, achieving the position of Field Sales Manager, before finding a second career, and his true calling, as a motivational speaker to the sales forces of top businesses around the world. Alan was one of the founders of The National Speakers Association and was honored with their Hall of Fame Award. He was also a Certified Hypnotist and Lifetime Member of the International Association of Counselors and Therapists. He was a founding member of the Malverne Jewish Center and remained an active congregant. Alan believed in the power of positive thinking and he lived that belief: riding a motorcycle, walking on fire and parasailing very late in life. He will be remembered for the cheerful greetings he had for everyone he met and for seeing the possibility for success in each new challenge. Services today, October 23, 10 AM, at Gutterman's Funeral Home, 175 Long Beach Road, Rockville Centre, NY. In lieu of flowers, donations to the United Jewish Appeal are requested.
