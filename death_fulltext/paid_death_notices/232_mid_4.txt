        TILLMAN -- Sophie Merrill, March 30, 1908-April 29, 2006. Widow of Nat Tillman (1908 - 1984), SMT leaves daughters Barbara, Iris T. Hill, Lynne; grandchildren Rebecca Hill, Andy Hill (Kelli Souder Hill); sons-in-law David Hofstra (Lynne), George Entenman (Iris); friends Dorothy, Milton; companion Meena; helpers Britt, Sandy, Joe, Nora, Sheila, Cooper Gramercy staff. Sophie's life was saved and prolonged by Dr. John Postley's crucial diagnosis in 1995 of NPH, his faith in her recovery, by Dr. Jeff Wisoff's skill and persistence in installing a working shunt. The family also thanks Drs. Weinberg, Lipkin. SMT loved NYC, its opera, dance, streets. Painter, reader, knitter, walker. She was smart, resilient, pragmatic. While terrified friends took to their beds during the 1938 broadcast of War of the Worlds, Sophie told Nat, ''Turn to another station; we'll see if it's on there.''
