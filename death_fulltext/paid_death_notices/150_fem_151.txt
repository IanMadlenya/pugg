The officers and staff of United Jewish Communities deeply mourn the untimely passing of Avery Silverman, the niece of Carole Solomon, National Campaign Chairman for United Jewish Communities. She was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Howard Silverman of Villanova, PA. It is our hope and prayer that beautiful memories will help sustain the family during this difficult time. May they be comforted among those who mourn for Zion and Jerusalem. Charles R. Bronfman, Chairman of the Board Joel D. Tauber, Chairman of the Executive Committee Stephen D.
