        ELEFTERAKIS-John, M.D. His friends and colleagues at Lutheran Medical Center mourn the sudden loss of Dr. John Elefterakis. We will miss his engaging wit and personal energy as much as his medical competence and devotion to his patients. John was affiliated with Lutheran Medical Center for fifteen years, first as an intern and resident then as an associate attending physician in medicine. We offer our heartfelt condolences to his wife Dori, his children and his entire family. His friendship, loyalty and dedication will be missed by all of us. Joseph Rando, M.D., President Lutheran Medical Center, Medical and Dental Staff Joseph P. Cerni, President Lutheran Medical Center
