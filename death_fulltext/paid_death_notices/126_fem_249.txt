        DOPPELT-Elizabeth J. (Beebe). Age 51, a woman of exceptional warmth, imagination and courage, died July 29, after a twenty-one year battle with breast cancer. Born Elizabeth Beebe in Brooklyn, New York, Liz excelled at Lincoln High School and at Brooklyn College, and maintained a working knowledge of physics and chemistry. She spent every childhood summer at Camp Taconic in the Berkshire Mountains, building lifelong friendships there. Her early ambitions included becoming a ballerina or an astronaut. Instead, she became an entrepreneur, creating several successful businesses built on her fine eye for style and design. Liz's companies included Beaux Dangles (women's high-fashion accessories) and Really Lizzie (unique children's gifts). Most recently, she was the proprietor of GreenHouse of Winnetka, Illinois, an innovative shop specializing in antiques for rooms and gardens. She traveled the country pursuing unusual and fine objects for her customers and her home. Liz was generous to close friends and business acquaintances alike, and provided both knowledge and encouragement to many women who suffered with her disease. She was loving and wise for her children, Rachel and Adam; her husband, Neil, and her brother, Hank, all of whom survive her. She was unfailingly supportive to her family through every big and little crisis in their lives. Despite her illness, Liz had no bitterness or regrets about her own life, only good humor and enthusiasm for her next challenge. Her strength was extraordinary. With her courage, her ready wit and keen intellect, and especially her loving spirit, she enriched the lives of all who knew her.
