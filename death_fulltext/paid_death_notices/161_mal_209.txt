        RETCHIN-Peter William. Of Phoenix, Arizona died suddenly June 12, 2000. A former New Yorker. He graduated from Columbia University 1968. Moved to Phoenix and founded R&R Property Management. We mourn the loss of Christopher's father. He loved his family and friends deeply. A loving husband to Betsy, adoring son to Merv and great brother to Maude and Ellen. His impeccable style, love of life and smile will be deeply missed by his family and friends. Our son and his, Christopher, will forever hold him in his heart. Until we meet again.
