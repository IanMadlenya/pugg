        SPENCER-Diana. The patients and staff of The Aids Care Center at the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center mourn the tragic death of our beloved benefactor. The Princess touched all of our lives through her efforts on our behalf, as well as her tireless campaign to eliminate stigma and demonstrate a loving, concerned approach to the sick and needy. We will miss the kindness and grace of this remarkable advocate for humanity. Jonathan L. Jacobs, M.D., Medical Director Samuel Merrick, M.D., Associate Medical Director Gerard Ilaria, CSW, Program Director
