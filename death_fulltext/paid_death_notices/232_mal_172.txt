        SCHER - Harold, 89, has passed away on February 11, 2006. He leaves behind a family that deeply loved him that includes his loving wife Leah Ruth, step-son Marc, granddaughter Elizabeth, together with Nellie, Sandi, Jennifer and Marc plus the memory of stepson Michael. This part of his family, his temple friends and the neighborhood he loved, wanted to but could not say goodbye earlier. We will remember his love, kindness and devotion. We will smile when thinking of his acting jobs, the gym work-outs, his work with the aging, and his world travels. Rest in peace, dear Harold. Love, Leah Ruth
