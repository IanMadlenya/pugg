        MEHLMAN--Benjamin Wm. The Reconstructionist Rabbinical College expresses its heartfelt sorrow to his three daughters, Lisa Robinson, Deane Zimmerman and Irna Gadd, and his grandchildren Alex, Elizabeth and Emily Gadd. Beloved husband of the late Evelyn R. Mehlman. Bill, 94, was a founder of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, past chairman of the board, a member of the board since the college opened in 1968 and member of the college's executive committee. He was a friend and associate of Mordecai Kaplan, the intellectual founder of Reconstructionist Judaism. Bill's wife, Evelyn, was a musical protege of Kaplan's daughter, Judith Kaplan Eisenstein. The music Evelyn composed is now sung in Reconstructionist congregations around the country. May the memory of his dedication to Klal Yisrael, careful study and the pursuit of purposeful Jewish life be both a blessing and a charge. Aaron Ziegelman, Gen.
