        KOZUBEI - David. Died peacefully in his sleep on August 26th, at his home in Manhattan. He created the concept for the original Borders bookstore, located in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and founded the still running David's Books there. He was an accomplished writer and a prolific actor known for his eccentric look and wild eyes. He impacted countless people through his version of Wilhelm Reich's work that he called ''Movements,'' and through his wisdom, humor, spontaneity, kindness, and his ability to enjoy simple and exquisite aspects of life, most especially, a wide range of literature and philosophy in his beloved books. He is survived by his ex-wife Catherine Fitzmaurice Kozubei, his sons Saul and Jacob Kozubei, and grandchildren Benjamin and Natasha. David's remains were scattered at sea in New York.
