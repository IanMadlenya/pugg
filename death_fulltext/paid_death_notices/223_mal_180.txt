        ELDER--Duncan. It is with profound sorrow that Citizens Housing and Planning Council marks the passing of Duncan Elder, the esteemed former Chairman of our Board of Directors. We will sorely miss his clarity of vision, dedication to affordable housing, and loyalty to CHPC. Our deepest sympathy to his wife, Frannie, their children, and grandchildren.
