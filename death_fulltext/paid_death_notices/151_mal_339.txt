        MacLEECH-Bert, Ed.D. The Board of Trustees, the staff, and consumers of YAI/National Institute for People with Disabilities mourn the loss of Dr. Bert MacLeech. In 1957, Dr. MacLeech and his wife, Pearl, founded the Young Adult Adjustment Centers which later became YAI/National Institute for People with Disabilities, one of the nation's largest providers of services to people with developmental disabilities. In contrast with the then prevailing practice of placing people with developmental disabilities in institutions, Dr. MacLeech pioneered the movement to establish community based services for these individuals. His vision that people with developmental disabilities can and should lead productive lives in the community continues to serve as the guiding principle of our agency.
