        DYSON-Charles Henry. In grateful memory of Charles Henry Dyson, a man for all seasons and a staunch advocate and supporter of education. Entrepreneur par excellence, no investment in his illustrious career paid or will pay greater returns than the contributions to the education of the young men and women at the colleges and universities he and his wife, Margaret, supported. He will be sorely missed, but his legacy will live on for generations to come in the richness of the education that he and Margaret provided to so many. Roger H. Hull, President of Union College
