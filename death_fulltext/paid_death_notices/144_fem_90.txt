        FIVES-Grace. She entered into eternal rest on January 8, 1999. With great sorrow we see the end of an era. Grace owned the North Shore Steak House in Great Neck. Prior she ran The Jolly Fisherman in Roslyn. For all who knew her, she had a ready smile and a welcome. Left behind are her two sons Michael and his wife Kathy and John and his wife Chrissy, along with her many grandchildren, nieces and nephews, her brothers Ed and Richie. She will be missed deeply. Her memory will live on.
