        COSTA-Rena. The Officers, members of the American and Global Boards of Trustees, faculty and staff of Bar-Ilan University in Israel, and the American Friends of Bar-Ilan, mourn with great sorrow the passing of one of the University's most generous benefactors, Rena Costa, founder of the Rena Costa Center for Yiddish Studies, one of the world's premier institutes of its kind. Mrs. Costa will be remembered for her significant contribution to the revival of the Yiddish language and culture in the academic world, as a memorial to the six mllion Jews who perished in World War II, as Yiddish was the ''mother tongue'' of most of them. Currently, more than 100 students are registered in Yiddish courses at Bar-Ilan, both in language and literature. A beloved member of Bar-Ilan's Presidential Founders Society, and American and Global Boards of Trustees, Mrs. Costa contributed to the advancement of higher education and the strengthening of scholarly excellence and Jewish heritage by her commitment to our University and her philanthropic spirit. Mrs. Costa fled Hitler's Europe just prior to World War II and through her extraordinary talent and drive, became a highly successful member of the diamond industry, where she was admired for her unshakable personal integrity, back in the days when a woman's rise in the business world was highly unusual. Though she was often vocal, she had an exceedingly lovable personality that will be sorely missed by her countless friends and admirers. We extend heartfelt condolences to her sister, Trudy Gildin. May her entire family draw solace from inspiring memories and be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
