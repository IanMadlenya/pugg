        HUGHES--Charles. Alexander. Of New York City, died quietly on June 21, 2006 after a long illness. We mourn the passing of our witty, cultivated and gentle brother and uncle, who devoted his life to the study of the world's languages. He worked for many years as a spontaneous translator and tour guide, and wrote language learning books which are still in use. Charles never failed to converse with people he met in their native tongue. His humor and equanimity, even in the face of physical adversity, inspired and delighted his family and friends. Born in Altoona, PA., in 1916, and educated first at Princeton University, Charles received undergraduate and graduate degrees from New York University and Columbia respectively. He is lovingly remembered by his surviving sister and brother, Helen Hafner, and William Hughes, of Gaithersburg, MD., by the family of his recently-deceased sister, Janet Stolz, of Chester Springs, PA., and as a loving grand uncle, great grand uncle, neighbor and friend. There will be a graveside service in Altoona at a later date.
