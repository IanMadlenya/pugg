        RILEY-Elizabeth M. The Trustees and staff of The Pierpont Morgan Library mourn the death of Elizabeth M. Riley, who died in New York on January 27, 2002. She was ninety-four years old. Liz, who had a distinguished career in publishing children's books, became a Fellow of the Library in 1955 and served as a conscientious, devoted, and valuable member of the Board for twenty-four years. She believed passionately in the importance of books and great institutions, making her a vigorous force in guiding the Morgan Library. We will greatly miss her and extend our heartfelt sympathy to her family and friends. Charles E. Pierce, Jr., Director S. Parker Gilbert, President, Board of Trustees
