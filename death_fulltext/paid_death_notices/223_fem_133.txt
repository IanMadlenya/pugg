        CIARDI--Alexandra Morgan. The Tufts University community is deeply saddened by the loss of our esteemed alumna, friend, and benefactor, Alexandra Ciardi. Mrs. Ciardi's friends at Tufts recognize her many contributions to society as a business leader, patron of the arts, and philanthropist. Mrs. Ciardi served for many years as member of the University's Board of Overseers to the Arts and Sciences. She had also served as President of the Tufts Club of London and as a member of the Tufts Alumni Admissions Program for the United Kingdom. She was a longtime supporter of the University and a generous donor to the University's new Music Center. We will always be grateful for Mrs. Ciardi's outstanding service as a volunteer, advocate, and ambassador for Tufts, and her generosity as a dedicated benefactor of the University. We extend our heartfelt condolences to her husband, Giuseppe, their children, Olivia, Francesco, and Federico, and their entire family. Lawrence S. Bacow, Pres. Jamshed Bharucha, Senior VP and Provost Brian K. Lee, VP for University Advancement
