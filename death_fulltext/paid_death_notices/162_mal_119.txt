        CASSEL-Walter. New York City Opera mourns the death of its friend and colleague Walter Cassel. He joined the City Opera in 1948 and, for over twenty years, provided us with many memorable evenings in the theatre. More recently, he became a noted vocal coach to young singers, thus providing his encouragement to the next generation. We send our deepest sympathies to his family, his colleagues, and his many friends. Paul Kellogg General Director
