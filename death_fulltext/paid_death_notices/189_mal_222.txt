        MAXYM-Stephen. The Juilliard community is deeply saddened by the death of Stephen Maxym. One of the most distinguished bassoonists of the Twentieth Century ry, he was on the Juilliard faculty from 1956 to 1992, where he taught many of today's active, professional bassoonists. His humanity, sincerity and personal integrity were hallmarks of a long and distinguished career. Our condolences go to his wife Lucy, his children, and his many friends. Bruce Kovner, Chairman Joseph W. Polisi, Pres.
