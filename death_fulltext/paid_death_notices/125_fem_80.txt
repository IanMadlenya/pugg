        HOFFER-Rose Liebman. The Brooklyn Law School community notes with profound sadness the passing of Rose L. Hoffer, a member of the Class of 1954, and a distinguished and cherished alumnus. Her devotion to the Law School was reflected in her tireless service as President of the Law School Alumni Association, her generous scholarship aid to students, and support of the Capital Endowment Campaign. A woman of intellect, grace and good will, she will be deeply missed by all. We extend our deepest condolences to her beloved husband Philip, her children and grandchildren, and the entire family. Paul Windels, Jr. Chairman, Board of Trustees Joan G. Wexler, Dean Hon. William C. Thompson Alumni Association President
