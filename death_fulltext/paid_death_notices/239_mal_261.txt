        SHWARTZ--Harold, December 12, 2006 at home in Pompton Lakes, NJ. Hesh, son of John and Anna Shwartz, was born in Paterson, NJ, valedictorian of his high school class, graduate of New York University, and served in the Army Air Corps during WWII. He was the president of John Shwartz, Inc., which his father started in 1905 in Paterson and which was North Jersey's oldest furrier. He and his wife, Jean, with whom he worked for over fifty years, expanded the business beyond furs to fine women's apparel, using a personalized approach that lead to multiple generations of families to being clothed by him. In the New York fur and fashion markets, his reputation allowed him to do almost all of his business on a ''handshake.'' He taught all who knew him to value family, education, and heritage, the importance of charity, how to treat people and to embrace humor. He is survived by his wife and had five children and four grandchildren.
