Dan Lipsky taught for 46 years at, and was instrumental in creating the nationally recognized Accounting Program of Brooklyn College. Those who knew ''Danny's'' loving manners-especially his children, his grandchildren, his brothers, his late wife of 65 years, his good friends, and his students-recognized him as a profoundly gentle, decent, patient and dignified person. The grace of his ways will remain an inspiration to those he left behind.
