        WOLZ-Carl. The trustees and staff of the Asian Cultural Council are deeply saddened to lose a great friend of Asian-American partnership in dance and a dedicated mentor to dancers, scholars and educators throughout the U.S. and Asia. His unbounded generosity and wise counsel are sorely missed yet remain an inspiration to all those committed to international exchange.
