        ARNOLD--Barry. Passed on July 12 2004, peacefully at his home at age 56 in the loving care of his family. He was deeply loved and will be sadly missed by his loving wife of 34 years, Sandy, children Leslie and Michael, son-in-law Michael Sobel, parents Rhoda and Sol Arnold, sister Susan Keller, relatives and friends. He was a CPA and Managing Partner of Landau Arnold Laufer and Co., LLP, and past president of Jericho Jewish Center. Brilliant, generous, and kind. He was a mentor and friend to so many. His integrity and optimism will not be forgotten.
        ARNOLD--Barry. Heartfelt thoughts and prayers go with you, our very dear friends, Sandy, Leslie (Mike), Michael, Rhoda, Sol and Susan on the passing of your beloved Barry. We will sorely miss our wonderful, devoted and cherished friend with whom we have shared many years of special memories. With all our love, Barbara, David, Larry and Scott.
