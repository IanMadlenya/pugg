        CHWATT -- Mara Tower. Went peacefully in her sleep on August 28, 2003. Although her time here was short, a mere 64 years, her impact on this world was tremendous. She was a devoted sister, a beloved aunt, and a most cherished friend. Mara is the beloved mother of Glenn and Lori Chwatt, Suzanne and Craig Litt, and Jaime and Evan Friedman. Mara is the adored Mimma of Jordan, Skylar, Ricki, Jenna, Kyle, Dani, Jason, Jessica and Andie. She will be incredibly missed and forever, always and a day in our hearts.
