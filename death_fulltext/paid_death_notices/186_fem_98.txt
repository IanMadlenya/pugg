        WALSH-Ann Virginia Watson. Beloved mother of Gloria, Brooke, Hughes deWitt and Thomas deWitt, died suddenly on Saturday, July 13, 2002, at the age of 70. She was preceded in death by her husband, Thomas deWitt Walsh. She is survived by her grandchildren, Brisa, Julian, Jonothan and Martin. She graduated from Smith College in 1953 and moved to New York to pursue a career in the business world. For many years she worked in New York in the cosmetics industry, where she rose to Executive Vice President at Germaine Monteil Cosmetics, at a time when most women were home. She later moved into the real estate industry, and was a real estate broker for Brown Harris Stevens at the time of her untimely death. She loved the opera, symphony, theater, and spent many hours with her dear friends playing bridge. Many people have described her as a saint for her selfless care of others in their time of need and was often involved in many causes, especially her alma mater, Smith College. There was no one like her-her sharp mind, thoughtful ways and poised disposition. We will miss her terribly. A memorial service will be held on Thursday, July 18, at 1 PM, at the Church of the Heavenly Rest, 90th St. and 5th Ave.
