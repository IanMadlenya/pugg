        ALPERT--Carl. The American Technion Society (ATS) expresses its profound sorrow at the loss of Carl Alpert, Technion historian and roving ambassador, and one of the university's most eloquent advocates and spokesmen. Himself an integral part of Technion history--known as ''Mr. Technion''--Carl headed the Technion Public Affairs and Resource Development Division, where he was a driving force behind the building of Technion City, the campus on Mt. Carmel. He served as executive vice chairman of the Technion International Board of Governors and as national president of the Association of Americans and Canadians in Israel. In addition to his masterful two-volume history of the Technion, Carl was an internationally syndicated columnist whose reports on Israel appeared in Jewish weeklies in major American cities and were a tribute to the great historic adventure that is the story of Israel. In tribute to the person many consider the Technion's most outstanding employee, the Carl Alpert Employees Center was dedicated in 2003, endowed by ATS friends. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife Nechama, his children and grandchildren, and the entire Alpert family. American Society for Technion-Israel Institute of Technology Dr. Stephen A. Laser, Pres Evelyn Berger, Chairman of the Board Melvyn H. Bloom, Executive VP
