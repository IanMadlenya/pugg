        MURRAY-Archibald R. The Board and Staff of the New York Foundation mark with enormous sadness the death of our former Board member, Archibald R. Murray. His patience and composure guided us through many complex and charged issues at the Foundation. He was an attentive, conscientious and very wise Trustee. The city is poorer for his passing.
