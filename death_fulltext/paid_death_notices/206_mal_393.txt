        COOKE--Alistair. On behalf of the Board of Trustees, staff and volunteers of Thirteen/WNET, we lament the passing of Alistair Cooke and extend our sympathies to his wife and children. A broadcaster of extraordinary sophistication, wit and class, he was one of public television's most admired personalities and an international ambassador for culture and civilization. All America will miss his silver hair, his silver tongue, and the countless golden moments he shared with so many over the years. We trust his legacy of brilliance will live on in the work of thoughtful broadcasters throughout the world. Steven Rattner, Chairman William F. Baker, President
