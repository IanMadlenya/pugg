        MANDELBAUM -- Moshe. Died March 24 at 92. As a soldier in the Polish army he survived the Nazi blitzkrieg. After crossing the countryside he returned home to his pregnant wife Tanya. Within months he was taken from his home to the first of eight concentration camps that he would endure over the next 51/2 years. His wife and their son Chaim were killed at Auschwitz. Moshe never saw his child. After liberation, he bravely joined the search for Nazis and collaborators. He later married Elsa Klein and emigrated to Israel. He is survived by his wife, three children, seven grandchildren and one great-grandchild. His strength of will, optimism and triumphant spriit continue to serve as an inspiration. Through all the suffering he considered himself lucky. Moshe, we are lucky to have known you.
