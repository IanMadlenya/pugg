        SUMMER--Ronald C. On behalf of the entire Abraham Joshua Heschel School community we are deeply saddened by the untimely passing of Ron Summer, our beloved past-President and current trustee. His passion, vision, courage and integrity were instrumental in forming and building the Abraham Joshua Heschel School. From our founding days to the recent opening of our high school, Ron was a moving force seeing each project to fruition. We will always be indebted to him for his leadership and counsel. To his wife Ellen, daughter Haley, son Douglas, daughter-in-law Allison, son-in-law Rob and the entire family, we express our deepest sympathy. May you be comforted with the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Alisa R. Doctoroff, President Roanna Shorofsky, Head of School
