Surviving Ed are the thousands of students whose lives he has changed and whose hearts he has healed. Our entire community grieves the passing of this loyal Yankee fan, this tender-hearted gentle giant. A memorial service will be held at West Side High School, 140 West 102 St, NYC on Friday, January 26 from 2-5PM.
        REYNOLDS-Edward. He was one of the pioneers of the alternative education movement. He served as a pillar and giant for all those who believed in educational reform. He was original in thought and generous in spirit. There is now a void in all our lives. The National Academy of Alternative Education
