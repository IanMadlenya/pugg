        FREDERSEN-Rosalie S. On April 6th, 2001. Beloved daughter of the late Fannie. Devoted sister and dearest friend of Shirley Singer. A noble mind, a gentle spirit and kindness personified; her beautiful smile and her endless sense of humor. She will be sorely missed by all who loved her.
        FREDERSEN-Rosalie S. To my dear one, I told you before how deep is the ocean, how high is the sky, how much I have loved you and will till I die, and now that I've lost you, how much I will cry. Deep as the ocean, high as the sky. Shirl
