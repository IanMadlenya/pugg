        AUERBACH-Ella. The Board and staff of Selfhelp Community Services note with sorrow the passing of a devoted member of our community. One of the first professionals employed by the agency, she brought an understanding of the needs of new arrivals to this country and a willingness to help them find their way. Her interest in the agency continued in recent years as an active member of the Concert Committee well into her 90's. Her work will continue.
