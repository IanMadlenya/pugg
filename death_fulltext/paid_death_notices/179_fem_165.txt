        MEYER-Rhona Mahler Stein. Although Rhona Stein moved to Ridgefield, CT 15 months ago to marry Dean Meyer, she was a true New Yorker. Rhona was born in Brooklyn, and was a longtime resident of Oceanside, NY. Rhona's fervent love of life, love of people-and we mustn't forget to mention her love of shoppingcombined with her incredible energy for living each day to the fullest to inspire so many. Leslie Popoff of Great Neck, NY said ''Rhona was unique in her ability to see the joy in almost everything life has to offer.'' Her charisma, happiness and genuine warmth brightened people's days and befriended everyone she met. After years as a practicing dental hygienist, she joined the insurance industry and organized dentists into provider networks. Prior to Ridgefield, she resided in Great Neck, NY. Rhona died peacefully at home on December 22, 2001, of breast cancer. She is survived by her husband, Dean Meyer; her daughter, Bonnie Stein of Great Neck, NY; her son, Brad Stein of Honolulu, HI; and her sister, Robyn Schwartz of Morganville, NJ. Rhona had just celebrated her 50th birthday.
