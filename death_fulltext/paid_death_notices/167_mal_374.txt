        ZAND-H. Herman. The Board of Trustees of Long Beach Medical Center mourn the sudden passing of H. Herman Zand, a distinguished member of the Board. A man of intellect and principle, Hy faithfully served the Medical Center for 23 years as a member of the Board. He was an accomplished attorney and, for years, served as our voluntary counsel. Hy could always be counted on to ask the right questions and offer his prospective on the issues in debate. His voice and wise counsel will be greatly missed. We extend our deepest sympathies to his son Richard, daughter Anne-Marie and to his entire family. Alfred I. Osterland Chairman, Board of Trustees Bernard Kennedy President, Board of Trustees Douglas L. Melzer Chief Executive Officer
