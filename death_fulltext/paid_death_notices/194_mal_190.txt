        SILIN-Abraham S. On March 18, at age 91. After a long life, a decade of illness, a sudden, peaceful end. Always striving to live up to impossibly high ideals-kind and engaging, fierce and determined. Devoted husband, father, grandfather, brother and friend. He will be sorely missed by all. At home, 124 West 79 St., Wednesday 4:00-6:00, Thursday 2:00-4:00, 7:00-9:00.
        SILIN-Abraham S. A wonderful, caring friend of many years. The most ethical of men. He will be missed by all. Our condolences to Evelyn and the family. Barbara and Jim
