        ABRAMOWICZ-Dina. (1909-2000). The Board and staff of the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research mourn the passing of our distinguished Research Librarian and friend, Dina Abramowicz on April 3. Devoted to Jewish research history and scholarship, she embodied the values and brilliance of Vilna (Yerushalayim de Lita), her birthplace. Librarian at YIVO since 1947, her life and work are an example to us all. She will be sorely missed. May her memory be for a blessing. Funeral service will be Thursday, 12 PM at Parkside Chapel, 98-60 Queens Blvd. (66th Avenue), Forest Hills. Bruce Slovin, Chairman of the Board Carl J. Rheins, Executive Director Aviva Astrinsky, Head Librarian
