        AUERBACH-Gerald. We mourn the loss of this dear friend and Director of MDA's Television Production Division. An extraordinarily talented film and television director and producer, Jerry created his first film for the Association in 1956. He produced thousands of educational videos during some forty-five years of helping the family's MDA serves-many of which were featured on and contributed to the success of the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon. We extend heartfelt condolences to his wife, Elaine, and to their four children. Jerry Lewis, National Chairman Robert Bennett, President Robert Ross, Executive Director Jerry Weinberg, Director of Field Organization Muscular Dystrophy Association
