        LOWE--Minnie Senter. The officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Minnie Senter Lowe, whose lifelong dedication to Jewish causes included her presidency of the Pride of Judea for more than 20 years. Minnie's legacy is carried on by her beloved children, Rabbi Harvey & Anne Senter, Arthur and Sandy Lowe, Jeffrey and Fonda Lowe, and Stewart and Donna Senter, treasured leaders whose ongoing support and dedication strengthens our ability to serve those in need. We extend our deepest sympathies to Minnie's children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and the entire family. Morris W. Offit, President Susan K. Stern, Chair of the Board John S. Ruskay, Exec. V.P. & C.E.O.
