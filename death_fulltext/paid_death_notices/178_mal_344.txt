        JACOBS-Samuel. Age 95, of Palm Beach, Florida, passed away on November 22 in New York City. He is survived by his loving Millie, sisters Mary Bergofin and Kitty Chepovsky, seven grandchildren and their spouses, fourteen greatgrandchildren, his son-in-law Ernest Rubenstein and daughterin-law Eleanore Jacobs Goodman, and many nieces and nephews. He was predeceased by his first wife Anna and both his children Phyllis Rubenstein and Arthur Jacobs. Born in poverty, Mr. Jacobs achieved great success in the liquor industry as one of the three founding partners of Star Industries, Inc., and as one of the principal shareholders of The Paddington Corporation. Generous to a wide variety of charities, he was particularly dedicated to the Educational Alliance, a lower Eastside Settlement house of which he was the largest and most consistent individual donor over the past 20 years. Funeral services will held on Sunday, November 25th at 11:15 AM, ''the Riverside'', Amsterdam Avenue and 76th Street in Manhattan. Contributions in his memory may be sent to the charity of the donor's choice.
        JACOBS-Samuel. The Board and staff of the Educational Alliance mourn the passing of Samuel Jacobs, one of the most generous and long term supporters of Alliance programs and services. Mr. Jacobs was the father-in-law of Ernest Rubenstein, the Alliance's honorary Trustee who served valiantly on the Board for 40 years, including extraordinary leadership roles as President and Chairman of the Board. We offer our heartfelt condolences to Mr. Rubenstein and the grieving Jacobs family. Richard A. Cantor, President Robin Bernstein, Exec. Dir.
