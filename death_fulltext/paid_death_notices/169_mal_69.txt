        MOSLE-A. Henry, died January 31. He leaves behind daughter, Cassandra; son, Douglas; former wife, Lynn O'Shaughnessy, friends and family. He is also mourned by his best friend, Lilly Leonardis. He was a loving father, a devoted friend, and a sharp observer of the world and its foibles. We will miss him, his humor and his deep sense of loyalty. Donations may be made in his memory to the Groton School, Groton, MA 01450-0991, or the Roy Waters Scholarship Fund (jschneider@I-55.com). A memorial service will be held at Trinity Church, Princeton, on February 12, at 11:00 AM.
