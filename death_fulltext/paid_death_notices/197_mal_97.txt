        GERLITZ--Chaim, Rabbi. The Officers, Trustees and congregation of Temple Israel of Riverhead join his beloved wife, Malka and his family in mourning this very special man. Our spiritual leader since 1986, Rabbi Chaim was a master reader of Torah and an incomparable teacher of children and adults. Our services were filled with music as he led our congregation with his lovely singing voice. Rabbi Chaim was tireless and generous to a fault when helping family, friends and congregants. His and Malka's hospitality was legendary. His warm and welcoming nature will be greatly missed, and we have lost a friend and someone with whom we shared many experiences.
