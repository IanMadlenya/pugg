        BRAVMAN-Moses. Adored and adoring husband of Celia for 67 wonderful years. Devoted father of Irving and his wife Rose, doting ''Papa'' to his ''Goldschatz'' Elizabeth and her husband Jonah, and a truly ''great'' great-grandfather to Noah, Sarah, Rebecca, Daniel and Gideon Turk. He gave much joy and took much joy in his life. Ninety-four years was not long enough. He will be sorely missed by all who knew him.
