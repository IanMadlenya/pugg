        KOBLER-Richard. Inventor and Electronic Engineer. Died in JFK Medical Center in Ft. Worth, FL on May 8, 1999 at the age of 90. Mr. Kobler had over 100 patents to his name, was a pioneer in the field of sound recording and developed the first automated teaching machine called the ''Talking Typewriter''. Mr. Kobler was born and studied in Vienna, Austria where he later on had a patent office. His escape from Nazi Austria in 1938 was arranged by the film actress Gloria Swanson, documented in her autobiography, ''Swanson On Swanson''. In the U.S. he became European Manager of Engineering in Ms. Swanson's firm, Multiprises, Inc. Subsequently, Mr. Kobler became Vice President of Thomas A. Edison Industries and was appointed Director of Thomas A. Edison Industries Laboratories. Mr. Kobler invented the ''Voicewriter'', a remote-controlled dictation device which was installed in large institutions such as hospitals for the dictation of patient records. He invented the ''Rapidial'', the first phone to store and automatically dial frequently used numbers. Mr. Kobler developed several teaching machines, the first in the early 1960's. His ideas about the didactic power of technology were consummated by his ''Talking Typewriter'' proving consistently successful even with autistic and retarded children, despite the fact that the machine to teach reading & writing was designed primarily for very young children. In 1970, Mr. Kobler moved to Switzerland, where he lived for 25 years. In 1995, he took up residence in Florida. Mr. Kobler is survived by his wife, Dr. Edith Kobler and three children by a previous marriage, Arthur, Raymond, and Linda.
