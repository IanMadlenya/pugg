        GOLDKLANK--Jean. On December 24th. She could love, she did love and she is loved. When we had nothing, she made magic. She was smart and sexy and knew how to have fun. We were lucky. Thank you Jean from your loving family. Services Friday, 1 PM, at ''The Riverside'' 76th St. and Amsterdam Ave.
