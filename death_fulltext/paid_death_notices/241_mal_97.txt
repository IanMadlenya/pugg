        PLIMPTON--Calvin H., M.D. The SUNY Downstate Medical Center community mourns the passing of Dr. Calvin H. Plimpton, President of SUNY Downstate from 1971 until 1979. Dr. Plimpton facilitated the growth of key departments and divisions into internationally recognized academic and clinical services and presided over several landmark scientific advances. His tenure was striking throughout for his openess to new ideas, his conviviality, and his ready access to students and faculty members. Our condolences are extended to Dr. Plimpton's family, colleagues and friends. John C. LaRosa, M.D., President
