        JIMENEZ-Victor A. A resident of Park Slope for more than 25 years, a marine engineer and veteran of World War II, died at his home on January 29, 2000. He was 99. The cause was heart failure, his family said. He served as an engineer during the war in the Pacific and the Atlantic and was honorably discharged in 1945, but continued working on the ships until he retired in 1966. He is survived by his wife, Etelvina of 53 years, five daughters, Ethel Zogg, Mary Ann Kratz, Victoria McKenna, Helen Jimenez Ulloa, and Virginia Augello. He will be cremated and his ashes inurned at Arlington National Cemetery. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made to the Seamen's Church Institute of New York, Water Street.
