        GREENBERG--Harold Jay. The United Cerebral Palsy Association of Nassau County, Inc. deeply regrets the loss of a devoted Board member and tireless supporter of our agency, Harold Jay Greenberg. Harold's affiliation with ucpn began over 40 years ago. He served as ucpn Board President from 1970-76. Mr. Greenberg was an at-large member of the CP-NYS Corporation Board of Directors. The ucpn Torch of Leadership was awarded to him this November. We express our deepest sympathies to his family and friends. Thomas Connolly, President
