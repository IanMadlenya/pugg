        MARKMAN-Rose. There is never a good time for a life to end. Even though expected, the shock can be to hard to bear. Although Rose Markman was long in years, her mind was functioning as a young adult up until the last second of her life. To say we should celebrate her life and thank God for having her many, many years, does not diminish the ache her family now feels. She cherished each new life and did a poor job of trying to hide her intense love. Her sharp mind and quick response was astonishing. After the sixth great grandchild, we thought we were going to be lucky-we were going to have Nanny forever! Yesterday our luck ran out. What we'll always remember is her fiery and competitive spirit. Being good just isn't good enough. Love, The Markman Family
