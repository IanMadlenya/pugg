        COHEN--Donald, M.D. The New York Psychoanalytic Sociaty and Institute mourns the loss of its esteemed member, Dr. Donald Cohen. A training and supervising analyst, he served as Chair of our Child Analysis Committee for many years. Donald was a great clinician and a beloved teacher. Graced with warmth and humor, he cared deeply about children, was devoted and committed to his patients, and was a good friend to his colleagues. We will miss him deeply. We express our profound sympathy to his family.
