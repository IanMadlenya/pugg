        KIRWIN-Glenn Davis. Born November 3, 1960. Tragically September 11, 2001. You had it all, brains, generosity, athletics, loving son, husband, father. Loved by all who knew you. You set the benchmark for everyone in your excellence. Our hearts are broken for your family, Joan, Miles, Troy, your dear parents Barbara and Paul, four brothers and a sister. Uncle Lou Davis, Cousins Barbara, Arnold, David, Michele and Richard Cohen Linda, Robert, Brett and Adam Davis
        KIRWIN-Glenn. Glenn was an example of all that is good in mankind and his life was cruelly taken by terrorists who are examples of all that is evil. You were the best father and husband to Miles, Troy and Joan. We miss you. Ba and Pa
        KIRWIN-Glenn. You were everything to us and the strength of our family. We will keep our love for you in our hearts forever. We love you, Daddy. Joan, Miles and Troy
        KIRWIN-Glenn. On Tuesday, September 11, 2001, our circle was broken. We will never be the same. Jon, Peter, Andrew, Daniel and Jennifer
