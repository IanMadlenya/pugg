        LONDON-Theodore. We mourn the passing of Theodore London who died on Friday, January 25, 2002 of a heart attack in his home in Rishon Letzion, Israel. Teddy possessed all of the special qualities that a great human being should have. He was benevolent with his time and resources, selfless with his ability to help others, and humble and asked nothing in return for his generosity. Most of all, he was a true friend. We had experienced these loving qualities in his friendship with us and our beloved mother, Ellin Mitchell, particularly in her tragic battle fighting cancer. Teddy moved from New York to Israel three years ago to be closer to his family. He is survived by his daughter, Rona, and her children. His memory will be a blessing for us and others. Fondly, David, Alexander and Oliver Mitchell
