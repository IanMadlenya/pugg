        EBIN-Dr. Judah Lionel, age 86. In Atlanta, Georgia on April 3rd. Columbia University alumnus (BA, MD, Ph.D.); noted neurosurgeon, medical researcher and tennis enthusiast-the senior yearbook at New Utrecht High, in the subscript to his photo, had it right: ''Scholar, Athlete and Gentleman''. His was a bearing, a presence. An easy read: ''le style c'est l'homme''. To his dear wife, Virginia, and to his daughters and sons-from his kid brother David and his nephew Jonathan-may the memory of him bring strength and joy.
