        PENNINGTON--Malcolm. For 25 years Malcolm served the Jose Limon Dance Foundation with courage and distinction, guiding the company through many challenges and serving as Board Chairman for six years. He had an abiding faith in the humanistic vision and enduring value of Jose Limon's choreography. All of us will miss Malcolm's integrity and his gentle and gracious spirit.
