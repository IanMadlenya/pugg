        SHARPE--Libby A., 81. Loving and devoted wife, mother, grandmother and mother-inlaw. A great woman, she created love, happiness and good humor for her family and friends. Her courage, leadership and strong sense of justice in fighting for equality and responsive government inspired all who knew her and was reflected in over 50 years of leadership in the West Orange, NJ League of Women Voters and in many other civic organizations. She generously applied her talents and support to innumerable charities. She will be deeply missed by her husband Irwin, her children Debbie, Bonnie, Peter and Ken, their spouses Jill, Madeleine and Jeff, and her grandchildren Emily, Julie, Jenny and Sarah. >>AD#
