        NEWMAN-Abraham. Died at age 92, after a long, wonderful and happy life, surrounded by his family and friends. ''Poppy'' made his mark on all who knew him because of his warmth, generosity, gentleness and his unique ability to love, care and accept. He had survived his life match Lili, and their life together had been a grand adventure for 59 years. He is survived by his loving family, daughters Vicki and Jessica, sons-in-law Walter and Roger, granddaughters Karen and husband Scott, Amy, Catherine and Rebecca, and great-granddaughters Julie and Lisa. He was a quiet, gentle tower of strength, and all who knew him will miss his sweetness and his smiling face.
