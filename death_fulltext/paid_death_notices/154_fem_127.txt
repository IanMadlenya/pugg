        PARKER-Virginia. The City & Country School community mourns the loss of our dedicated and beloved colleague, Virginia Parker. For over fifty years, Virginia was an energetic and loyal contributor to the C. & C. community. Honest, forthright, caring and generous, Virginia was a cherished teacher, colleague, advisor to parents, and friend. Through her teaching and her modeling of the School's values in her interactions with all, she embodied the best of our School. We can't imagine our daily lives without Virginia. We will miss her greatly. A memorial for Virginia is planned for December 12 at 2PM at the School. The City & Country School community
