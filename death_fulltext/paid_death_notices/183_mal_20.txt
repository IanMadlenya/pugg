        LANG-Mel. The Mel Lang Winter Invitational Golf Tournament notes with great sorrow the passing of our founder, leader and beloved friend. We express our heartfelt sympathy to his beautiful and devoted wife, Lila, and to Jeff and Debi and his beloved grandchildren. He was special in so many ways and all who knew and loved Mel will sorely miss him.
