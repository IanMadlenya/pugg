        ROBBINS-Claire S. On April 9, 2001. Beloved wife, mother, grandmother. A cherished and caring person. Her warmth, and quiet inner strength, touched the lives of so many people, and left a lasting impression. For both family and friends, her loss is profound. Her memory, and spirit, will live on in those who loved her dearly.
