        WALTNER-Jules G., MD. The Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center community mourns the passing of Dr. Jules G. Waltner, Professor Emeritus of Columbia University College of Physician & Surgeons and Consultant Emeritus in Otolaryngology of The Presbyterian Hospital. A national leader in his specialty, Dr. Waltner pioneered the study of fluid circulation in the inner ear and helped develop many techniques used in the reconstruction of hearing mechanisms. He was also instrumental in the establishment of ultrasound as an early treatment for Meniere's disease. Having developed numerous techniques that continue to be used today, he will also be remembered for many other professional and philanthropic contributions. We extend our deepest condolences to his family. William T. Speck, MD, President and Chief Executive Officer, The Presbyterian Hospital Herbert Pardes, MD V.P. for Health Sciences and Dean, Faculty of Medicine at Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons
