        STEIN--Benjamin M., M.D. Born March 11, 1911 died August 21, 2005. Loving and devoted to both his wife Claire, and son Douglas, he lived a life of dedication to his family, to his profession and to his country, serving in World War II as a physician in England, Normandy, and Germany where he opened the first American Hospital after the war. In 1957 the Board Certified Radiologist purchased Brunswick Hospital in Amityville and developed it into the largest privately owned Hospital Center in the United States. He provided the latest technology for patient care and opened the first privately owned MRI facility in New York State. His concern for his staff and their advancement was so appreciated that every attempt to unionize his institution was defeated. Beloved and respected by all, may he rest in peace.
