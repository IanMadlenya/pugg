        MAGER -- Norman. With great sadness and a deep sense of loss, Perfect Building Maintenance mourns the loss of former President, Norman Mager, a respected business leader and friend to many. Norman began working for his father, the founder of PBM in 1950. Through his leadership, PBM became one of the largest privately held janitorial companies in New York City. His grace, sense of humor and most of all, dedication to his children and grandchildren affected the many people who came into contact with him. Our sincerest condolences to his son, Scott Mager, the CEO of Perfect Building Maintenance, and daughters Stephanie and Bess, wife Bernice, and the extended family. Norman was a beacon to all and his light will shine through his children and their children. We will miss you, Norman. Your friends and admirers at PBM
