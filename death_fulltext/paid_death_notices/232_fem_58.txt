The American Jewish Committee is deeply saddened by the passing of Sister Rose Thering, a cherished friend of the Jewish people. Her pioneering efforts in the mid-twentieth century contributed in large measure to changing the course of Catholic-Jewish relations. AJC was privileged to work with Sister Rose for many decades. As a result of her groundbreaking study of textbooks used in Roman Catholic parochial schools, significant positive changes were made in textbooks regarding Jews, Judaism and the Holocaust. AJC honored Sister Rose in 2004, with our Jan Karski Moral Courage Award for her lifelong commitment to Christian-Jewish relations, her unwavering and inexhaustible support for Israel, and her relentless opposition to anti-Semitism. We will deeply miss this courageous, principled, compassionate individual. May her memory forever be a blessing to those millions whose lives were touched by her exceptional decency and dedication. We extend our condolences to her grieving family. E. Robert Goodkind, Pres. David A. Harris, Exec. Dir.
