        FUCHS--Abraham. Congregation Ohab Zedek of Belle Harbor, NY, records with sorrow the passing of our beloved Hazzan. He served as our Cantor for more than four decades. In the course of this time he inspired our congregation with his masterful liturgical interpretation of our prayers, lifting us to spiritual heights at our Sabbath and Festival services. We will be forever grateful for his dedication to our Synagogue and for sharing his special talents with us. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his children, to Miriam and Charles Selingut; his grandchildren, Nora and Philip Brooke, Suzanne, Erica and Tsvi Selingut; and great grandson, Elan. May the family be consoled among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yehoshua Berkowitz, Rabbi Dr. Jacob Reiner, Rabbi Emeritus Joel Berkowitz, President Stanley Liker, Chairman, Board of Governors
