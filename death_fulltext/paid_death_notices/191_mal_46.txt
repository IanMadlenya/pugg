        TEPERMAN-Joseph H., J.D., D.M.D. The faculty and staff of NYU Medical Center extends deepest sympathies to our friend and colleague, Lewis Teperman, M.D., and to his family, on the death of his father, Joseph Teperman. Lawyer, dentist, and former instructor of forensic medicine at NYU School of Medicine, he also served with the Air Force Medical Corps during the Korean War. Dr. Teperman led a remarkable life that serves as an inspiration to us all. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Teperman family. Robert M.
