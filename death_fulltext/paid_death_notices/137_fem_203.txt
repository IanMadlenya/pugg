        MARMON-Betty ''Our Twoma''. Aunt Betty was a Renaissance woman. She cherished her family, friends and home, yet was a leader in building a more enriching life for all people in East Hampton. She shared her house with us for many wonderful summers and holidays and helped to create and then preside at the Jewish Center of the Hamptons. Even though she was an identical twin, she was truly one of a kind. We will always miss her and never forget her. East Hampton will not be the same without her. Susan Trovati, Stuart Griffen Vince, Robyn and Joslyn Trovati
