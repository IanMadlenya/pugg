        LIEBERMAN-Hillel. We mourn the tragic death of Hillel Lieberman, modest in all ways, but in his love of Eretz Yisrael and his faith in Hashem. We extend our love to his wife Yael and seven children, Rabbi Zvulun and Bracha Lieberman and sisters Tehila and Elyorah. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Judge Paul and Lea Lieberman David, Meira & Arielle Lieberman Dr. Jeffrey, Alyse, Jason and Samantha Lieberman Rochelle, Mark, Daniel and Julia Brandsdorfer
