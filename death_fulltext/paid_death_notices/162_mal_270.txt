        SHUMSKY-Oscar. The entire Juilliard community mourns the death of Oscar Shumsky, a member of the faculty from 1952 to 1978. A distinguished violinist, dedicated teacher, and creative conductor, he was a major influence on generations of musicians throughout the 20th century. His engaging personality and individual integrity will be deeply missed by us all. We express our condolences to the members of his family. Mary Rodgers Guettel, Chairman Joseph W.
