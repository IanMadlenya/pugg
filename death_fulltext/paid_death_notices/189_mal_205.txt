        COOK-James. A leading figure in the growth of Forbes Magazine and the magazine's executive editor until his retirement in 1992, died Wednesday of pneumonia in New York City. He was 75 and had been battling pulmonary fibrosis for many years. Jim graduated from Bowdoin College, Class of 1948, and earned a Master's Degree in dramatic literature from Columbia University. He taught English at midwestern colleges before chucking academia for journalism. He joined Forbes in 1955 and rose through the ranks, along the way penning a record number of cover stories. His skeptical mind and his broad concept of what constituted business journalism greatly influenced both his style and the philosophy of the publication as it is today. Throughout his life Jim retained a lively interest in the theater and in the novel. After his retirement he published in 2000 ''Fellow Travellers'', a novel based loosely on the family of controversial financier Armand Hammer; Cook knew Hammer well and had frequently written about him for Forbes. Cook is survived by his wife, Claire, and daughters, Karen and Cassandra, all of New York City. A memorial service will be held in the Forbes Magazine Galleries at a date to be announced. In lieu of flowers memorial contributions may be sent to the New York Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.
