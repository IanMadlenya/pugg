        JOHNSON-Beverley Peck. The Juilliard School mourns the death of Beverley Peck Johnson, esteemed member of the faculty since 1964. As one of the most distinguished voice teachers of the 20th Century, with dignity, grace and remarkable focus, Beverley developed generations of singers who have had an enormously positive impact on the profession. Her loving and caring ways have endeared her to her many students and colleagues. She will be deeply missed by all members of the Juilliard community. A memorial tribute will take place on February 5, 2001, at 5 PM in the Juilliard Theatre. Mary Rodgers Guettel Chairman Joseph W. Polisi President
