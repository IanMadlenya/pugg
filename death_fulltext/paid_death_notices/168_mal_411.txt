        SICHROVSKY-Karel. On December 11, 2000, age 76, of Forest Hills, NY. Beloved husband of Marie (nee Sarafianos) for 42 years. Dear brother-in-law of James and Viginia McCrory. Loving uncle of Thomas (Marlene), Gail (Willard), Nancy (Anthony) and Amy (Vincent). Fond great-uncle of Kelly, Corey, Stephen, Scott, Demetri and Louise. Born in Vlasim, Czechoslovakia, on September 16, 1924, the son of the late Karel and Vlasta (nee Smahova) Sichrovsky, he attended Charles University in Prague from May 1945 to February 1949, and passed his first state exam. As a refugee in Ludwigsburg, Germany, Karel received a scholarship to the University of Geneva, Switzerland, graduating in November 1950 with a degree (licensie) in political science. In April 1951 he joined Radio Free Europe in Munich as a writer serving on the Czech desk until August 1956, when he came to live in the United States. There he was a senior writer at RFE's New York office until September 1959, reporting chiefly on labor. He continued his studies of political science and history at Columbia Univeristy, receiving an M.A. in 1958 and the Certificate of the Program on East Central Europe in 1959. He became a US citizen December 27, 1960. Until he retired in 1987, his scholarship, language and editorial skills gained him the respect of those with whom he worked in the world of publishing. He ran his last race with courage and grace. A celebration of the life of this remarkable man will be announced at a later date.
