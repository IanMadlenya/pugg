        MOWSHOWITZ-Libby. Yeshiva University and its affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary mourn the passing of a deeply cherished friend, the beloved wife of the late Rabbi Dr. Israel Mowshowitz, an esteemed alumnus and inspired worker on behalf of his alma mater. She was the daughter of our revered rosh yeshiva, Rabbi Solomon Polachek, the preeminent prodigy known as the Meitscheter Ilui, who taught at RIETS 1921-28; adored mother of Sylvia (and Rabbi Jehiel) Orenstein and Dr. Solomon (and Dr. Deborah) Mowshowitz; and sister of Dr. Harry Polachek and Dr. Abraham Polachek. We shall miss her wise counsel, her warmth, and her acts of hessed. May her entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University David S. Gottesman, Chairman Board of Trustees Judah Feinerman, Chairman RIETS Board of Trustees
