In his spare time he founded a theatre company in Thuir, ''Les Beaux Masques,'' which has been very successful. He also taught theatre to young children and was involved in various community activities. The town of Thuir honored him with a medal in 1997.

He is survived by his wife Myra, his children Claudia Yapp & Gerard, & relatives in France, Jean-Francois Oudin, Alain Oudin, Sylvie Bourcier, Eric Bourcier and by the many people who knew and loved him. A memorial fund for Les Beaux Masques is being set up. We miss you Baba.
