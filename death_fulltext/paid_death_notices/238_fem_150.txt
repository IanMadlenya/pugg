        METH--Jean (Blank), beloved mother to Marceline Rechter and her late husband, Mel Rechter, and ''Grams'' to her late, much adored grandsons, Richard and Jamie Rechter, passed away peacefully, November 11th. ''Mother'' to the world, Jean raised six younger brothers and a sister following the death of her parents, Molly and Abraham Blank. After the untimely passing of her wonderful husband, Arthur, she threw herself into helping a variety of charities. She was the president of the Manhattan Chapter of the National Children's Cardiac Hospital, secretary to the Manhattan Chapter of Women's League for Israel, and enthusiastic supporter of countless humane organizations. She was filled with a boundless love for Manhattan, and walked tirelessly on the highest of heels, ruby lips smiling at everyone, while she explored the city exuding a passion for life envied by people decades younger. She was like a magnet, continually surrounded by strangers attracted to her vivacity, friends who adored her, her sparkling eyes signalling the genuine warmth that radiated from her soul. She was our rock, our confidante, our cheerleader, the center of our world. We will miss her forever, Marceline, Audrey and the entire Blank, Rechter, Solomon and Schwarzman families. She is survived by her daughter Marceline, her youngest brother, Lawrence Blank, CA, and Mrs. Isaac (Mildred) Blank, FL and her precious nieces and nephews, Ann, Madeline, Alan, Mark, Alvin, Russell, Leslie, Martin their children and grandchildren, and her incomparable aide, Bernice.
