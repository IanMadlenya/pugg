Born in Winnipeg, she grew up on her father's ranch in Saskatchewan, became a nurse, & emigrated to the United States, where she married David, her devoted husband until his death in 1957. She was a cooking teacher for many years; a brilliant chef herself, she is remembered for the lessons that made cooks of many of her friends.
