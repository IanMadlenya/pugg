        ARANGO-Milton. It is with great sadness that the Trustees, the Women's Board, the staff and especially the members of The Boys' Club of New York note the death of their dear friend on June 4th. ''Miltie'' joined the club in 1945 as a swimming coach at the Jefferson Park Clubhouse, eventually moving to the Harriman Clubhouse where he was Aquatics Director and finally, the Milliken Clubhouse, until he retired to Florida in 1990. An active retiree, he returned to Camp Cromwell each summer as mentor and friend. He will be remembered by us all with deep affection. The Milton Arango Annual Swim Meet will be held Friday, June 14th, 7:00 PM at the Harriman Clubhouse, 287 East 10th Street, NYC.
