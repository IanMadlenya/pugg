        DANGUILLECOURT - Sergio. The Manhattanville College community mourns the loss of one of its most dedicated and beloved alumni and trustees, Sergio Danguillecourt, and his wife, Jacqueline Kriz Danguillecourt, who died on December 19, 2005. Few individuals have so consistantly lived the college's mission, to educate ethically and socially responsible leaders for the global community. Mr. Danguillecourt, a 1990 graduate, served on the college's Board of Trustees for ten years. Over his impressive career, Mr. Danguillecourt was widely respected for his vision and commitment to education, students, and diversity. In honor of his mentor, Professor Edward W. Ryan, he established the college's first endowed chair, The Ryan-Bacardi Chair in Economics. Friends and alumni may wish to make contributions in Mr. Danguillecourt's memory to the Ryan-Bacardi Chair, Manhattanville College, 2900 Purchase Street, Purchase, NY 10577. We are deeply saddened and extend our heartfelt sympathy to his family, especially his two children. Richard A. Berman, President Manhattanville College, Purchase, NY
