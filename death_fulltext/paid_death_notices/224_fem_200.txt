        JACKNOW--Muriel. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) mourn the loss of our devoted friend Muriel Jacknow of Farmington Hills, MI. A past member of the ATS national and East Central Region Boards, Mrs. Jacknow and her late husband, Dr. David Jacknow established the annual David and Muriel Jacknow Prize for Excellence in Teaching. They contributed to various Detroit chapter and regional projects which funded Technion research, dormitories and laboratory equipment, and hosted meetings in their home. Mrs. Jacknow was also active in the ATS chapter in Sarasota, FL. We extend our condolences to her daughters Lisa Elias and Amy Jacknow, her son, Dr. Alan D. Jacknow, her grandchildren, and the entire Jacknow family. American Society for Technion-Israel Institute of Technology Stephen A. Laser, President Evelyn Berger, Chairman Melvyn H.
