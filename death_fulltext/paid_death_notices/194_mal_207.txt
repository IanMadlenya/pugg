        BURDSALL-James Harlan. A radio announcer best known by his on-air name of ''Jim Harlan,'' died on March 13, 2003 in Bronxville. He was the host of radio's famous Make-Believe Ballroom, on WNEW-AM before the station was sold and became a news station in 1992. He was 53. He died of complications after surgery and a prolonged illness. After serving in the U.S. Army in Vietnam in 1969 and 1970, Mr. Burdsall began a career as a radio announcer at WMMR-FM in Philadelphia, an album-oriented rock station. He left WMMR-FM for Philadelphia's WIOQ-FM in 1978, in both cases using the name ''Jim Harlan'' as his on-air name. New York City's new disco station WKTU-FM hired him in the early 1980s, using him as an on-air talent and sending him out to represent the station at its various New York club events. When the disco format fizzled, and new ownership switched the format to rock, ''Jim Harlan'' played the last disco song on WKTU and welcomed listeners to WXRK-FM, known as K-ROCK. He later moved to WNEW-AM, the music station known for playing standards, and took over as host of the legendary Make-Believe Ballroom show which aired from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. ''Jim Harlan'' brought stars of the music world to his show, interviewing Mel Torme, Rosemary Clooney and others on the air. The Make-Believe Ballroom was the longest running radio show in the country when WNEW was sold and switched to an all-news format in 1992. He was the last host of the famous show. Most recently, he hosted music shows on WVNJ. He is survived by a son, Matthew, of New Canaan, CT, and a brother, John, of Little Silver, NJ. A memorial service will be held at the New Canaan Methodist Church, 165 South Avenue, New Canaan, CT, at 1:30 P.M. on March 30
