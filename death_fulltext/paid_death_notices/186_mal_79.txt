        STUBENHAUS-Jerome. We at Nassau Radiologic Group, P.C., and its affiliated companies, mourn the loss of our esteemed colleague, Jerome Stubenhaus. Jerry died on Wednesday, July 3, 2002. He was 77 years of age. Jerry worked with the Nassau Radiologic Group for 50 years and was a key component in the success of the group. As the central administrator and advisor, he has impacted ''NRG'' for the years during his tenure as well as for the years to come. His keen business skills, his creativity, his visionary talent, and above all his caring personality, have shaped one of the country's largest outpatient radiology and radiation therapy companies. He always remarked that one of his great accomplishments was convincing the physicians of NRG to accept credit cards throughout their offices. Jerry you will be missed greatly both professionally and personally. You will remain in the hearts of so many of your colleagues.
