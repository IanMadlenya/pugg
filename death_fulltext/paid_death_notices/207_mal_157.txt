        KERLIN--Gilbert. The partners, associates and staff of Shearman & Sterling LLP mourn the passing of our partner and distinguished colleague Gilbert Kerlin, who died Thursday at the age of 94. The importance of Gil's contributions to the firm and to his partners cannot be overstated. He has also been justly praised for his philanthrophy and services to his community of Riverdale, NY. He was an exceptional partner and friend whose charm, talent, dedication and exuberance will be missed by all.
        KERLIN--Gilbert. Trustees, administrators, faculty, staff and students of The Putney School wish to extend their condolences to the family of Gilbert Kerlin for their loss, and to express their sincere gratitude for his kind and generous support.
