        DE LA CRUZ-Hipolita (Dona Polita). On February 7, 1997, our mother, a special loving presence died peacefully at the Kateri Residence on Riverside Drive in New York City. Deep sorrow is felt by family members, her daughter Elma M. Lopez (Paula), her son Peter De La Cruz, and grandchildren Melissa, Corey, Adriana, Casondra and Mario. Our sincere appreciation to the twelfth floor staff at Kateri Residence for the care given our mother. A heartfelt thank you to Bere Evers and our mother's ''guardian'' Argentia Rivera for their moral support. Thank you mother for the love you gave us and your truly generous nature. Especially from you daughter siempre Te Adoro Madre. Now that your winter surrounds you, may your spirit be at peace. Services were held privately.
