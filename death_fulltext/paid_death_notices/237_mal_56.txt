        APPLE--R.W., Jr. I was so proud to call Johnny my cousin and I really adored being with him. His musings always made the ''The New York Times'' brighter and much more delicious reading. I never stopped learning from him and always ate better because of him. He taught me to research every meal and as a result we discovered endless gastronomic delights. I will miss his intellect and wonderful insights and will be forever grateful for the time I shared with Johnny and Betsy, most especially our time together in England. My deepest sympathy to Betsy, Catherine and John. Aggie Gund
