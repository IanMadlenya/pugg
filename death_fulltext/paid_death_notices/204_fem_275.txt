        MARX--Gertie F., M.D. Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University records with profound sorrow the passing of our renowned and distinguished professor emerita of anesthesiology. A member of our founding faculty, in 1954, Dr. Marx's outstanding contributions to the field of anesthesia in labor and delivery profoundly influenced the well-being of countless mothers and babies. A firm believer that pain during childbirth could be harmful to mother and child, she literally created the field of obstetric anesthesiology and the Gertie Marx Needle is a mainstay for the epidural block still in use today. We remember Dr. Marx as a uniquely caring physician, an influential educator and an innovative researcher in pain relief during labor. She will be greatly missed by all those who knew her. We extend our deepest condolences to her family. Dominick P. Purpura, M.D. The Marilyn and Stanley M. Katz Dean Albert Einstein College of Medicine
