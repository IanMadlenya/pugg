        FURMAN--Lawrence H., 81, of Jupiter, FL, left us on October 4, 2004 for an eternal fishing trip. Beloved and devoted husband and father, respected architect and world class fisherman, he will be missed by all who knew him. Larry leaves behind Gloria, his adoring wife of 55 years, five loving children and spouses and 13 grandchildren.
