        EDELSTEIN--Mildred. American Friends of The Hebrew University and The Hebrew University of Jerusalem mourn the passing of Mildred Edelstein, a long-standing American Friend known for her enduring dedication to Israel and its people. Along with her late husband, Sidney, Mildred's generous acts of philanthropy enabled the creation of HU's Edelstein Library on the History of Science, as well as the Sidney M. Edelstein's Center for the History and Philosophy of Science, Technology and Medicine. Mildred's memory will exist in perpetuity at The Hebrew University and among a new generation of scholars and leaders for Israel. We extend our sympathies to her daughter, Ruth, and to the entire family. AFHU George A. Schieren, President Ira Lee Sorkin, Chair Peter T. Willner, National Executive Director The Hebrew University Prof. Menachem Magidor, President
