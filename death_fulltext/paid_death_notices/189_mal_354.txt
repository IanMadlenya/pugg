        HOXIE-R. Gordon, Ph.D. The Board of Trustees, the Board of Editors, and the members of the Center for the Study of the Presidency mourn with deep sadness the passing of their Founder, President and Chairman Emeritus, Dr. R. Gordon Hoxie. A graduate of the Air War College, Dr. Hoxie earned a BA in History in 1940 from the University of Northern Iowa, in Cedar Falls; a Masters of Arts from the University of Wisconsin; and a Ph.D. in History from Columbia University in 1950. In the mid 1950s, with the help of Marjorie Merriweather Post, Hoxie founded the C.W. Post College on Long Island. A retired Brig. General in the United States Air Force and former Chancellor of Long Island University in New York, Hoxie was well known in senior government circles. In 1968 he founded the non-partisan Center for the Study of the Presidency as a forum on the institution of the U.S. Presidency, and established the Presidential Studies Quarterly as a resource and archive for historians and Presidential scholars. Most importantly, Hoxie was deeply committed to the leadership development of young men and women. For this purpose he established the Annual Student Symposium at which college student leaders from around the nation and abroad came to interact with government leaders and other senior level specialists on issues instrumental to the American Presidency. The Center Fellows Program, which grew out of the Symposium, gave selected students additional in-depth opportunities to pursue their own research. Hoxie was a visionary who served his country and his colleagues with distinction.
