        FRIEDMAN--Norma. Cherished wife of Morris, beloved mother of Ruth and Philip, died peacefully at home on June 10th after a long bout with Alzheimer's. She was a fashion writer who spent a decade at Vogue and Harper's Bazaar. Dedicated to community service, she volunteered for many years at the Helen Keller National Center in Port Washington and helped low-income students gain scholarships to college. Norma was known by all for her extraordinary warmth and compassion. In addition to her immediate family, she is survived by her adored neice and family, Lorna, Dale, Zachary and Seth, and by the many friends who loved her. A service will be held at Riverside-Nassau North Chapels in Great Neck at 11 a.m. on Wednesday, June 13th, after which the family will welcome visitors at home. Interment will be private. In lieu of flowers, her memory will be honored by donations to the Alzheimer's Foundation and the Helen Keller National Center. Norma was smart, witty, loving and beautiful. We miss her terribly.
