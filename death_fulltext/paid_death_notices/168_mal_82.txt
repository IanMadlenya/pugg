        POSSNER-Bernard Murray. We regret the passing of Bernard Murray Possner of DelRay Beach, FL on Wednesday, January 3, 2001. ''Bernie'', as he was affectionately called, was a resident of the Marine Park section of Brooklyn, NY where he helped found ''The East Highway Little League'' and ''The Kingsway Babe Ruth League.'' He was a distinguished member of the Madison Jewish Center of Brooklyn NY for many years, where his three sons were bar mitzvahed. His memberships in many charitable organizations included the Presidency of the Margorie Bregman Mandel League of the Kingsbrook Medical Center. His affiliation with the Knights of Pythias lasted over 50 years. He is survived by his beloved wife of 59-1/2 years Sylvia, his three sons Harvey, Stuart and Ivan, his ''daughter'' Donna, his two daughters-in-law Sandy and Fran, his seven grandchildren David, Ilana, Marrah, Jamie, Scott, Michelle and Billy, his sisters Henrietta and Sylvia, his beloved brother-in-law Phil, his five nieces Estelle, Joanie, Ronnie, Barbara and Beatrice, and his nephew Steven. He will surely be missed. Rest in peace, sweet prince. Graveside services held today, at 10 AM at Mount Ararat Cemetery, Farmingdale, New York.
