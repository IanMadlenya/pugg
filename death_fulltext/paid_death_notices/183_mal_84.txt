        ROSENBAUM-Edmund. We extend sincerest condolences to Drs. Alfred and Jacob Rosenbaum on the loss of their beloved father. Through their incredible kibud av, service on the New York Board and as a Founder, respectively, they carry on the mesorah that they so meaningfully learned from him. May the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Amer. Comm. for Shaare Zedek Med. Cntr in Jerusalem.
