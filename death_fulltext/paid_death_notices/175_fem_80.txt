        ROBINSON-Grace (nee Crispinelli) of Elmsford and White Plains, NY. Good and loving wife of Frank, cherished daughter of Florence and Adam Crispinelli and beloved niece of Joan Crispinelli, Marion Rainaldi and Clara Rosner.

During a teaching career, which spanned over 25 years, 12 of which were spent as a member of the religious order of The Divine Compassion, Grace touched the lives of parents, students and colleagues of the Westchester educational community. Grace will be missed by all who knew her and who now share in the grief and pain of her loss.
