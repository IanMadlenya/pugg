        OPTEKMAN--Annette. With profound sadness we mourn the passing of our beloved mother on July 22nd. She enriched our lives and the lives of her grandchildren and great - children. And, of course, that of our dear father, Harold, whom we lost in 1998. This extraodinary woman, born in New York City, graduated from Hunter College and was a Teacher in the NYC school system. Among her many interests, she contributed to the community as an active leader at Anshe Sholom Jewish Center. In 1987 she and our father were honored by the UJA-Federation Campaign. Annette brought happiness to every life she touched and she will be eternally missed.

        OPTEKMAN--Annette. We sadly mourn the loss of our grandmother, Nana Net. She surrounded us with all the love and warmth she had and blessed us with a wonderful sense of humor. We shall carry with us her vigor for life as well as the wonderful memories we shared together. Brad, Gordon, Stacy, Barbara and Rick >>AD#
