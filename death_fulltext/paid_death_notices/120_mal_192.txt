        ANGELO-Frank. After being admitted to a Florida hospital for routine surgery on Tuesday, January 7, 1997, Frank Angelo suffered complications, which led to a cardiac arrest. With family and friends at his side, he passed away on the evening of Sunday, January 12, 1997. Frank's passion for people and for life was expressed in all that he did. Although his devotion and generosity to people seemed extraordinary to others, it was ordinary for Frank. Frank was the co-founder of M.A.C. Cosmetics. The memorial service will be held in Toronto for family, friends and colleagues on Wednesday, January 22, 1997 at 1:00 PM at St. Paul's Anglican Church at 227 Bloor Street East. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the M.A.C. AIDS Fund.
