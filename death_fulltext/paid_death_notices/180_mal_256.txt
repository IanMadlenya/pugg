        DEMME-Ted. The entire staff of Creative Film Management mourns the loss of Ted Demme. A wonderful creative partner, Ted was an even better friend. Ted loved his work and everyone loved working with him. Besides vision, energy and wit Ted had a big heart. Our sincerest condolences to his wife Amanda and his children Jackson and Dexter. Ted set a standard. His enormous professional talent and endearing personal qualities will be sorely missed. But his example will continue to inspire us.
