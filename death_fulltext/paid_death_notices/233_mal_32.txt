        BENARIO--Ernest. On June 1, 2006, my beloved husband and father of our sons Peter and Jeffrey, died after a long illness at the age of 82. He will be missed by all who had the privilege of knowing him. He was drafted into the United States Army at the age of 19, he graduated from Camp Richie as a CIC Agent and took part in the Invasion at Normandy with the 5th Armored Division. During the Battle of the Bulge he was awarded the Bronze Star and he stayed in Germany for one more year to work for the American Government. After returning to the United States he joined the Food Brokerage of Sayres Company Inc., which he bought in 1976 and served as the CEO until the year 1992. All his life he was determined to be successful in everything he did, and his dynamic personality will be sorely missed. Our marriage lasted 61 years, and his loss to me and my sons will be forever with us. Ernest also leaves three grandchildren, Elena, Lara and Alex, and his daughter-in-law Karen. Funeral arrangements are strictly private.
