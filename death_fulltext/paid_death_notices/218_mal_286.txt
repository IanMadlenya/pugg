        GENDLER--Paul H., Ed.D. Died March 24, at age 79, after a three-month struggle following influenza pneumonia. Lifelong educator, first as exemplary teacher and principal, then as respected superintendent of schools, and finally after retirement as founder of Language Institute For English, intensive schools for English as a Second Language at universities across the country--but always as the most amazing husband, father and grandfather. Everyone who knew him was in awe of his brilliance, wit and supreme kindness. Dearest husband of 52 years of Rochelle, beloved father of Dr. Ellen Gendler and Dr. Seth Gendler, much loved fatherin-law of Dr. James Salik and Dr. Lilia Gendler, adored grandfather of Jonathan and Michael Salik and Samantha and Clement Gendler, brother of Dr. Samuel Gendler and Lawrence Gendler. He was a man of unusual intellect, the quintessential scholar who knew everything from Shakespeare to world history, as well as being a formidable chess player and champion billiards player. His unique gifts will live on through the students he taught with whom he continued to be in contact, the people who worked for him at L.I.F.E., and the family he loved so much. The world is richer because he was in it. Services Sunday 1 PM, Gutterman's, Boca Raton, FL. In lieu of flowers donations may be made to Boca Raton Community Hospital, Medical ICU, c/o Dr. Bernard Kaminetsky.
