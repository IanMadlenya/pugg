        TERENZIO-Peter. Greater New York Hospital Association regrets the passing of Peter Terenzio, former Executive Vice President of Roosevelt Hospital. Mr. Terenzio, a true visionary, was deeply committed to improving the health care of all New Yorkers and former Chairman of Greater New York Hospital Association. He was influential in the expansion of ambulatory care to children and one of the first to recognize the critical importance of research in teaching hospitals. We extend our deepest sympathies to his family and friends. Mark J. Mundy, Chairman Kenneth A. Raske, President Greater N.Y. Hospital Association
