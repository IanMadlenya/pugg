        LARSEN--Margaret Zerbe. Born in Euclid, Ohio, on June 6, 1903, the daughter of Jerome Brainard Zerbe and Susan Eichelberger. She was ''Margot'' to all who knew her, the widow of Roy E. Larsen, President of Time Inc. for 21 years and Vice Chairman before his retirement in 1979. An avid birder, Mrs. Larsen's deep interest in wildlife and preserving ''open spaces'' led to the development in Fairfield, CT of the Connecticut Audubon Society's 175 acre Margot and Roy Larsen Sanctuary. Together, Roy and Margot donated more than 1600 acres of land to the Nantucket Conservation Foundation. The Larsens had been summer residents of the Island since 1937. Mrs. Larsen was predeceased by her brother, Jerome B. Zerbe of New York. She is survived by her daughter, Margot Anne Simonson of Wayzata, MN; her three sons, Robert Roy Larsen of Fairfield, CT, Christopher Larsen of West Hartford, CT and Jonathan Zerbe Larsen of New York City, NY; nine grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren. Contributions may be made to Nantucket Conservation Foundation, POB 13 Nantucket, MA 02554 or Connecticut Audubon Society, 2325 Burr St, Fairfield, CT 06824
