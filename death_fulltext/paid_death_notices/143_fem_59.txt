        FINDER-Regina. It is with great sorrow that the Board of Directors and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Regina Finder. As a result of her Holocaust experiences, she acquired a driving passion to help fellow Jews. Her dedication, philanthropy and leadership marked her as a true ''eseth chayil.'' This tradition of giving and compassion has been passed on to her daughter, Alisa Sorkin, a member of our Board of Directors and a past chair of the Brooklyn Women's Campaign. Our deepest sympathies go to: Alisa, and her husband, Morton; her grandchildren, Francine Siegel, and her husband, Ken; Gail Setton, and her husband, Maurice; her son, Jeffrey; and to the entire family. May her memory be a blessing to us all. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair James S. Tisch, President Stephen D. Solender, Exec V.P.
