        GEARHART-Robert Paul, M.D. An attending physician at Lenox Hill Hospital for forty-five years, he died on December 27th, 2000 at the Piedmont Retirement Center in Thomasville, N.C. He was 88 years old. Golda, his wife of 60 years, was at his side. Born in Montoursville, PA., he received a degree in Business Administration from the University of Pittsburgh, before graduating from Temple Medical School in 1939. He interned at Saint Vincent's Hospital in Erie, PA. He then served as Chief Resident at newly opened Triboro Hospital in New York City, before joining the staff at Lenox Hill in 1943. In 1948, he was appointed to the teaching faculty and was named Chief of Pulmonary Medicine in 1964. He served for many years as Chief of the Nursing Health Service and Chief of the Employee Health Service, which were ultimately combined under his direction. With little interest in hospital politics and business, Dr. Gearhart turned down several high-profile opportunities during his career. He much preferred to lead rounds with residents, to brighten the hospital with his spirit and humor, and to dedicate himself to his patients and practice. He retired in 1988. In addition to his wife, he is survived by his daughter Susan, and her children Shane and Erin; son Robert, Jr. and his daughter Erin; and son Reid. A memorial service will be held January 13 at the Piedmont Retirement Center (336-474-3804). Donations to the Alzheimer's Association or charity of choice.
