        GELLER-Lillian. Died peacefully on August 30, at the age of 90. Loving mother of Sophia, grandmother of Janet and Laurel, and greatgrandmother of Matthew and Douglas. A woman whose generosity knew no bounds, whose inquisitive spirit about people was accompanied by her sharp wit, and whose zest for life will be a role model for all of us who loved her.
