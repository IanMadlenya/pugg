        ZUCKERMAN - Rosalind. The Brooklyn Law School community mourns the loss of Rosalind Zuckerman, a steadfast, devoted, and very beloved member of the law school administration. She served as the Law School Bursar for more than three decades, and a succession of Brooklyn Law School trustees, deans, faculty members, and students benefited from her wisdom, compassion, and energy. Her presence will be sorely missed; her imprint will long endure. We extend our deepest sympathy to her children, Arthur, Lawrence, and Barbara, her daughter-in-law Beth, her grandchildren, and the entire family. Paul Windels, Jr., Chairman Board of Trustees Joan G. Wexler, Dean
