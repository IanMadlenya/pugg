        SHTOB-Abraham. The entire National Lawyers Guild family embrace our Dotty, her children Terry and Eric, grandchildren Danny and Nicky, and great grandson Hugo as they mourn Abe, labor educator and life-long fighter for social justice. Dotty derives so much of her devotion to us from her partnership with Abe. Heartfelt love.
