        BURNS--John Stuart. On June 8, 2003. Born in Atlanta, a neighbor of Margaret Mitchell, a Yalie, a New Yorker and, finally, a resident of Cutalossa Road, Bucks County, PA. A patron of The Metropolitan Opera, fine restaurants and co-founder of a great wine cellar (remember the Leonardo Da Vinci). A wonderful, civilized beacon in an otherwise unstable world, Jack was loved by all who knew him. We will all miss his fine (wicked) sense of humor and gentle, good nature. AlexAnder and George needed someone with whom to share a fine Bordeaux and so they called him to table this past week. Jack, we knew and loved ye.
