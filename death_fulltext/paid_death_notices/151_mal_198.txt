        CRAVIOTO-Humberto, M.D. The Department of Neurology of the NYU School of Medicine sadly acknowledges the passing of our honored colleague and friend Humberto C. Cravioto. He was a fine scientist and physician and a warm, deeply decent human being. His good humor, compassion and professional abilities will be sorely missed. E.H.
