        EISNER-Helen. Cherished mother of Shirley, Philip and Arnold. Devoted Gaga of Alexandra and Lauren. As a young girl of 13 in Sosnowiec, Poland, she was taken to the Ghetto and then away from her parents by the Germans to the Gleiwicz Camp. She was the sole survivor of the Adler family. Helen was a kind and gentle woman who after coming to America at the age of 23, gave the whole of her life to her children and grandchildren. She was a supportive and giving parent and friend. We will miss her greatly. Services will be held at Sharon Gardens Cemetery in Valhalla on Wednesday at 1:30PM. The family will sit Shiva at her home in New Rochelle following the funeral 4-8, Thursday 2-7, Friday 10-2 and Sunday 12-5.
