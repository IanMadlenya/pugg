        BROWN-Dr. Milton. The faculty, students, staff and alumni of the Ph.D. program in Art History at the City University Graduate School mourn the passing of Emeritus Professor Milton Brown. He taught art history at Brooklyn College and at the Graduate School of the City University for over 35 years and was responsible for the formation of the Ph.D. program in Art History, where he was its first Chair. With his 1955 groundbreaking book, American Painting from the Amory Show to the Depression, he was critical in the development of the field of 20th century American art history. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife Blanche. His warmth, scholarship and humanity will be sorely missed.
        BROWN-Milton W. Died February 6, 1998, at age 85. Renowned art historian, esteemed colleague, dear friend, we will miss you. Our love and sympathy to Blanche. Naomi, Walter, Nina, Lisa Rosenblum
