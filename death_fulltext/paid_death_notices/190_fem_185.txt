        UNGER-Pearl. The Yeshiva University Family mourns the passing of a deeply cherished friend who, together with her late beloved husband Milton, was a Benefactor. They established the Milton and Pearl Unger Department of Jewish Studies at The Marsha Stern Talmudical Academy-Yeshiva University High School for Boys where they endowed a major scholarship fund to enable deserving and needy students to attend the school. Her warmth, sense of humor, broad knowledge and artistic talent will be sorely missed, and she will be remembered for her far-reaching generosity. Heartfelt condolences to her family. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University Ronald P. Stanton, Chairman YU Board of Trustees
