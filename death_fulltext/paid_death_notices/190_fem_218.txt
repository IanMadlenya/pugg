        MALAKOFF-Henrietta. Died Wednesday, two weeks from her 87th birthday. She was known for writing and directing plays and variety shows, first for cub scouts and the PTA, and then later for her Senior Citizen friends. Her humor and kindness infused not only her staged productions, but also her friendships, and her job as a children's speech therapist. As an avid trailorite with her late husband Samuel Malakoff, she spread her jokes continentally. She was a life member of Hadassah, and mother of the late Lee and Edward Malakoff. She is survived by her daughter Joyce Wallace, her grandchildren Julia Wallace, Sarah and Rebecca Malakoff, and Ari Kahn. Services will be held on Sunday 1 P.M. at Riverside Memorial Chapel.
