        NEWBURGER-Eleanor Peters. Died September 27, 1999 at age 71. Spirited, smart, funny, undaunted, she was a fearless speaker of other languages, a tireless museumgoer, a life-long learner. She held a B.A. from Columbia University, School of General Studies, and worked for a time at Perspectives, an international journal of American culture. Widow of Stanley Newburger, she will be remembered and especially missed by their children Robert, Emily, Laurie and Lisa, grandchildren Zack and Emma, sisters Ruth and Liz.
