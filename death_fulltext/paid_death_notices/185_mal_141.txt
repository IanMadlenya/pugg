        CARRUS-Gerald. The College of Physicians & Surgeons at Columbia University mourns the passing of Gerald Carrus, a remarkable supporter of medicine and a loyal friend. The scientific and clinical community at Columbia is saddened by his loss. Since he first came to the Medical Center in 1986, Gerald Carrus with his wife Janet was inspired to support programs in medicine and surgery, especially those to advance research and diabetes. The Carrus's philanthropy helped establish a major laboratory in Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center and a chair in the surgical sciences, and launched the careers of talented young scientists. Gerald Carrus was a generous and unassuming man whose generosity and kindness touched many lives. We extend our deepest sympathy to Janet and the Carrus family. Gerald D. Fischbach, MD Executive Vice President For Health and Biomedical Sciences, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, Columbia University
        CARRUS-Gerry. Our dear, trusted partner and friend, we will always miss you and miss your wise counsel. Thank you for always being there. Sleep well. Michael Wiener and Family
