        PHINIZY-Coles. On July 12, 2000. He is mourned and will be missed by his family and friends. For many years, a resident of Port Charlotte, Florida, he was born in Augusta, Georgia on September 29, 1919, son of Coles and Mary Harison Phinizy. He was a graduate of The Hill School, as well as Harvard College where he was Chairman of The Harvard Lampoon. He served as an army officer during the Second World War. He began a professional journalism career with Life Magazine, and, in 1954, became a ''charter member'' on the masthead of the first issue of Sports Illustrated, staying with that magazine as an editor, writer and photographer until retirement. He covered the first Australian Olympics in Melbourne in 1956, but his normal beat was on and under the water: SCUBA diving, swimming , and sailing. He made many technical contributions to underwater photography, and reported from Rhode Island on several America's Cup regattas. He spent a happy retirement boating and fishing on the Gulf of Mexico. Contributions may be made in his memory to Planned Parenthood Federation of America, 810 7th Ave, New York, N.Y. 10019. He is survived by his former wife, Helen Adams Phinizy of Stamford, Ct, a daughter, Catherine Phinizy Parys of Mystic, Ct, a son, Coles H. Phinizy, Jr. of New York, and two grandsons, as well as nephews and a niece.
