        SCRIBNER-Howard A. Jr. A wonderful guy! Irrepressible, irreverent, an iconoclast. One never had to resort to guesswork to know where Howard stood on any matter; he told you without circumlocution or embroidery regardless of your station. Howard was our friend and advisor for many years and there will never be a meeting at which he won't be missed. Officers and Directors Herman Goldman Foundation
