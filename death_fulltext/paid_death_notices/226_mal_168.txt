        ZIERING--Herman. The AntiDefamation League mourns the passing of Herman Ziering, a longtime ADL activist and supporter. A survivor of the Riga ghetto, Herman's leadership on ADL's Task Force on Nazi War Criminals was invaluable in the effort to bring to justice those responsible for the Holocaust. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife Lea and the entire family. Barbara B. Balser National Chair Abraham H. Foxman National Director
