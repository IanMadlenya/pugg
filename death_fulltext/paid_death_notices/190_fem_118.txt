        ETTENBERG-Billye. Adored wife of the late Max, proud mother of Florence Janovic and Madeline Fried, motherin-law of Evan (''from Heaven'') Janovic and the late Leonard Fried. Doting grandmother of Joseph and Adam Janovic and Laura Dines, loving great-grandmother of Valerie, Max, Phoebe, Graham, Isabelle and Lily. Gentle and tough, Billye will be remembered for her love of music and dance, for always wearing a hat, for going to college in her 50's, for taking courses in poetry and philosophy in her 80's, for approving of Chicken Mcnuggets, for eating the French fries from her grandchildren's plates, for walking all over town (e.g. from 35th Street to the Whitney, where she was a volunteer), and for tutoring her neighbors' children.
