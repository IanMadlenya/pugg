        STRAUS-Martha (Turim). Loving beloved wife of the late Eli Straus, died Saturday at home. At her 100th birthday party, July 16, 1999, surrounded by a few dozen of her four generations of admiring nieces and nephews, she recalled that she had enjoyed ''living it my way,'' recommended her independent life-style to all her ''progeny'' and urged them to continue to cherish their family's special closeness, renowned generosity and independence of thought and spirit. Born in 1899 on New York's Lower East Side, she graduated from Hunter College in 1920, was a NYC mathematics teacher for almost 40 years, and was a leadership member of New York's United Federation of Teachers, who honored her recently. She loved European travel and keeping up with all the marriages and births in the Turim family. But her favorite hobby was always attending adult education at Hunter. A special person; a special role model; a very special Aunt, particularly to Ruth and the late Sidney Botvinik, Eleanor and George Fox, Shirley and Paul Rothkrug, Rose Kalman and their successor generations. A ceremony celebrating her life will be scheduled.
