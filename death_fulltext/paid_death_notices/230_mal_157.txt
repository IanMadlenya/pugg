        WOLHANDLER--Joe, 86, died in his sleep at home in New York City on Saturday, February 4, 2006. He was born in Greenwich Village, attended New York City public schools and graduated from the City College of New York. After successfully arguing a non-religious conscientious objection to military service he volunteered with the American Field Service and drove an ambulance in European and African theaters of war during World War II, twice receiving the French Croix de Guerre. After the war he worked briefly for United Jewish Appeal, then began a career in public relations that lasted more than forty years. Joe specialized in theater, television, and motion pictures, and had corporate accounts as well. Among his many clients were Marilyn Monroe, Robert Loggia, Piper Laurie, Jack Lemmon, The Theatre Guild, Sears, Texaco, Jane Fonda, Procter & Gamble, Carol Baker, Andy Griffith, General Electric and Burl Ives. At one time Joe handled six plays running concurrently on Broadway. Some of the dozens of television shows he introduced to the public were Get Smart, The Beverly Hillbillies, The Dick Van Dyke Show, and Car 54, Where Are You. To publicize GE's Carousel of Progress exhibit at the 1963-64 New York World's Fair, Joe flew a family of three Disney Studios life-size animatronic robots on a scheduled flight from Los Angeles to New York, First Class. Also on Joe's resume was a part in Elia Kazan's film ''A Face In The Crowd,'' in which he brought uncanny depth to the part of ''Press Agent,'' and gave realism and complex meaning to his sole line, ''Right!'' Joe, always left of center, was greatly amused when his union, The Association of Theatrical Press Agents and Managers, became part of IATSE. One of the films Joe worked on in the nineteen fifties was On The Waterfront. A memorial gathering is anticipated sometime in the spring in New York City.
