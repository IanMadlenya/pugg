        DLUGOSZEWSKI - Lucia. The 92nd Street Y mourns the loss of composer and choreographer Lucia Dlugoszewski, who, with her husband, Erick Hawkins, created an entirely new vocabulary of music and movement that stretched the boundaries of modern dance performance. After Hawkins' death in 1994, Dlugoszewski took the reins of The Erick Hawkins Dance Company, making her choreographic debut at the 92nd Street Y in 1999, as her husband had done in 1942. She died just as the company was beginning its second season at the Y under her direction, premiering the stunning ''Motherwell Amor.'' After the company performed last year, the New York Times called Dlugoszewski a modern dance choreographer of exceptional promise, while Dance magazine proclaimed that the Hawkins legacy was in good hands. The 92nd Street Y is honored to have provided a platform for her unique art. She will be missed.
