        POPPER--Edwin L. Age 93, died at home on December 12, 2003. He had lived with Alzheimer's disease for many years. He was married to Eleanor D. Popper for 59 years, and is survived by three cousins, James, Will, and Charles Hochman. Ed was the last president of Leo Popper and Sons Glass, a firm which imported sheet glass and other glass items from Europe. Among the firm's customers, since the early twentieth century, were many studios of The Stained Glass Association of America. He was a graduate of Harvard University, class of 1931, receiving a Master's degree there, and after a year's study abroad on a fellowship he returned to Cambridge and became an instructor at Radcliffe College. He also served as a tutor at Harvard's Winthrop House. During World War II he served as a naval officer in harbor entrance control at Portland, ME, and later at Pearl Harbor. He will be remembered for his delight in people, his elfish sense of humor, and for an erudition which never diminished another person. His joy in life was radiant. Ed would be happy to know that contributions in his memory would go to Harvard University to benefit the Widener Library where he spent many happy and stimulating hours. A memorial service will be held at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81 St., Tuesday, December 16, at 11:30 A.M.
