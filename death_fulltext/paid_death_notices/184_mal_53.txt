The celebrated bass-baritone Robert Mosley, who thrilled The Met and other major opera audiences as Porgy in Porgy and Bess, Amonasro in Aida, the title role in Rigoletto and many other roles, died April 30 after a long illness. Mr. Mosley was a pioneer in breaking the barriers for Afro-American classical singers, and he will be remembered with gratitude by the many young artists of all races with whom he was always willing to share his knowledge, encouragement and unconditional support. A memorial service will he held at Trinity United Methodist Church in Wilmington, NC at 1:00 pm Saturday, May 11, 2002 by Rev. Skip Williams. The family will receive friends at the church one hour prior to the service. In lieu of flowers, his wife has requested donations to the Robert Mosley Musician Grant, c/o Judith Cantor, CPA, PO Box 97682, Raleigh, NC 27624. This fund will be used to provide financial aid to struggling musicians in the form of tuition scholarships as well as private study, and will be available to all musicians across the country in need.
