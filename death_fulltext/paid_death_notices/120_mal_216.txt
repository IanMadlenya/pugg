        ANGELO-Frank. The clients, volunteers, Board, and staff of The Momentum AIDS Project mourn the death of our friend, Frank Angelo. As a co-founder of MAC Cosmetics and the MAC AIDS Fund, Frank was a dedicated supporter of Momentum's mission of providing free communal meals and counselling services to New Yorkers living with HIV and AIDS and played a special role in establishing our annual gourmet fund raiser, Tastings, as a signature event. We will always be grateful for his leadership and commitment to fighting the AIDS crisis.
