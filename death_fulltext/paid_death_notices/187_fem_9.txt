        COULTER-Janis. Died July 31, 2002 in a heinous terrorist attack on the Mount Scopus campus of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. American Friends of The Hebrew University and the Office of Academic Affairs for the Rothberg International School mourn the profound loss of Janis Coulter, a friend, colleague and mentor to scores of young people pursuing higher education. Janis served as the Assistant Director of the Office of Academic Affairs for the Rothberg International School at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In this important role, she supervised the admissions of American graduate students to the full array of Rothberg International School graduate programs. A consummate professional, Janis supervised the marketing of the Rothberg International School in the United States and administered the Anna Sobol Levy Fellowship Program. Janis was known for her creative vision and also an indefatigable researcher who devoted much of her own time to advancing the educational mission of the Rothberg International School. She helped overseas exchange students and their families with kindness and good humor, qualities that endeared her to co-workers and friends. An honors student, Janis earned her B.A. from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. She obtained her M.A. from the University of Denver and studied at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem from 1996-1997, focusing on the field of Jewish Civilization. We deeply mourn the passing of Janis Coulter and extend our sympathies to her entire family. She touched the lives of many people in positive, lifeaffirming ways and she will truly be missed and remembered. American Friends of The Hebrew University Ira Lee Sorkin, President Keith L.
