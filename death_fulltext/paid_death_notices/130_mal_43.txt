        DEGEN-Abraham George. We mourn the loss of our dear friend. He was everything a friend could ever be. Devoted and loving, he stood by his friends and helped them through the ups and downs of life. His words and sage advice will never die, nor will the results of his many acts of kindness. We will miss him so and love him forever. Sandy and Leon B. Rosenblatt
