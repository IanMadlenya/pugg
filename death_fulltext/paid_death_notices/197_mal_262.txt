        McEWEN--O. Currier, M.D. The faculty and staff of NYU School of Medicine express their deepest sadness over the death of O. Currier McEwen, M.D., former Dean of the School of Medicine and a distinguished member of the faculty for thirty-eight years. Dr. McEwen graduated from the School of Medicine in 1926, completed his internship at Bellevue Hospital and joined the faculty in 1932. In 1937, at the age of thirty-five, he became the youngest man ever to be appointed Dean of a leading American medical school, up to that time. His service as Dean was interrupted during WWII, when he served as a Colonel with the renowned Bellevue Hospital Unit. Before retiring as Dean in 1955, Dr. McEwen's many accomplishments included the establishment of what is now NYU Medical Center. He was one of the nation's leading authorities on rheumatic diseases, and through his research, patient care and academic pursuits, he made many outstanding contributions to this field. Dr. McEwen retired in 1970 as Professor of Medicine. He embodied the finest traditions of the medical profession throughout his career, and his many years of service to NYU will always be remembered with respect and admiration. Robert M. Glickman, MD, Dean, NYU School of Medicine >>AD#
