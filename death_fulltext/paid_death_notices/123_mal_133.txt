        TCHERTKOFF-Victor, M.D. Beloved husband of Millie, devoted father of Susan and Bonnie, grandfather of Alex and Carolyn, and great-grandfather. A humanitarian, gifted teacher, close friend and mentor. He has touched my life and the life of my family in more ways that I can comprehend. He was always tough, but fair, and believed that all people regardless of income or race were entitled to the best medical care. I have always strive to live up to his example of integrity and fairness. I will miss him immensely, but his spirit will always give me inspiration.
