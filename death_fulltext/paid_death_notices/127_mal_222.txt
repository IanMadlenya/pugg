        PLANTAGENET-Richard III, King of England, misrepresented and maligned by history, maliciously killed by treason on 22 August 1485. He appealed to the ideals of loyalty, lordship and honor. He knew how to command, how to reward, but most of all, he knew how to inspire. Lovingly remembered by The International Patrons of the Richard III Foundation, Inc., PO Box 3381, Wallington, NJ 07057.
