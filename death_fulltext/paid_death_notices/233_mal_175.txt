        MERRILL - Philip. Cornell University mourns the loss of devoted alumnus, Philip Merrill, a champion of education who created the Merrill Presidential Scholars Program at the university, whereby exceptional Cornell seniors recognize the high school and Cornell teachers who inspired them. He also provided generous scholarships to financially needy students. Mr. Merrill recently funded Cornell University's Merrill Family Sailing Center on Cayuga Lake in Ithaca, NY, which, when it is built, will commemorate his love of sailing and Cornell. A member of the Class of 1955 as well as a renowned international statesman, adviser to U.S. and Cornell presidents, publisher with a commitment to public service, distinguished banker, and civic minded entrepreneur, Phil Merrill brought experience, distinction and vision to his roles as Cornell trustee, presidential councillor, and member of University Council. His entrepreneurial spirit helped guide the Johnson Graduate School of Management Advisory Council. Cornell University expresses its sincere condolences to his wife Eleanor, his son Douglas, his two daughters Cathy and Nancy, and four grandsons. Peter Meinig, Chair of the Board of Trustees Hunter R. Rawlings III, President Cornell University
