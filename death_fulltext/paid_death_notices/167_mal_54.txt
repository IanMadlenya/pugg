        BOHM-Milford Miles. The American Technion Society (ATS) expresses profound sorrow at the passing of Milford Bohm of St. Louis, a charter member of the St. Louis Chapter and a moving force in the ATS for more than 30 years. Mr. Bohm and his wife, Lee, established an exchange program for students and faculty between the Technion and the Washington University School of Business. Mr. Bohm also supported the Technion Faculty of Aerospace Engineering, the St. Louis Chapter audio-visual library, the Irving A. Shepard Chair in Finance, and faculty recruitment efforts. A Life Trustee of the ATS Board of Regents and an alternate member of Technion's International Board of Governors, Mr. Bohm was honored with a Technion Honorary Fellowship in 1999. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Lee Bohm and the entire Bohm family. Lawrence S. Jackier, President Irving A. Shepard, Chairman of the Board Melvyn H. Bloom Executive Vice President John S.
