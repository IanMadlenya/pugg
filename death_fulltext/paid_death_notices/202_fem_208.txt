        BERNSTEIN -- Sylvia, in Washington, DC, on November 21. Beloved wife of the late Alfred Bernstein. Mother of Mary, Laura and Carl. We remember a friendship begun at Columbia Law School between Henry and Alfred that lasted through turbulent years with loyalty and understanding. We celebrate Sylvia's beautiful life devoted to human rights and give thanks for the warmth and love she brought into our lives even in the last sad weeks. Jacqueline Schneider & Family
