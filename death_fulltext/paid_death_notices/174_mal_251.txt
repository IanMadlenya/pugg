        FARLEY-Kevin. The students, faculty and administration of the City College of New York/CUNY mourn the untimely passing of our friend & colleague, Kevin Farley, & offer our warmest condolences to his beloved wife Lisa, his son Michael and daughter Tara. A member of the CUNY family since 1982 who also worked at Queens, LaGuardia and Hunter Colleges, Kevin served for the last four remarkable years as the Director of Physical Plant Services at City College. His ability to get things done, his hearty Irish laughter and his large appetite for life will be sorely missed, even as they are permanently manifest in the halls and grounds of CCNY. Kevin loved City College, and City College loved him back. The College is administering a scholarship fund for Michael and Tara. Contributions should be made out to the ''Michael and Tara Farley Scholarship Fund,'' and sent to The City College of New York, Shepard Hall Room 154, Convent Avenue at 138th Street, New York, NY 10031.
