        GELBTUCH-David. We extend our Kos Tanchumim to Benjamin Gelbtuch on the loss of his beloved father, David Gelbtuch. Benjamin, along with his wife Hadassa, are Golden Founders of the Hospital, benefactors of the Woman and Infant Center and long-time supporters of our Annual Dinner and Concert Sponsorship campaign. They have shown an extraordinary commitment to bringing compassionate healing to the people of Jerusalem. This outstanding expression of tzedakah and chesed, as demonstrated by their devotion to Torat Yisrael, Am Yisrael, and Eretz Yisrael, emulates the example set by Benjamin's father, who was a kind, gentle and loving man to all who knew him. May the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. American Committee of the Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem Charles H. Bendheim, President Erica Jesselson, Chairperson of the Board Sidney G.
