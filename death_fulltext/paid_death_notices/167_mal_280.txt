        MITCHELL-Stephen. It is with profound sorrow that the students, graduates and faculty of the Postdoctoral Program mourn the untimely loss of Stephen A. Mitchell, Ph.D., a devoted friend, teacher, mentor, and supervisor as well as a preeminent contributor to contemporary psychoanalytic practice and scholarship.
