        KRAEHENBUEHL - David, 73, composer, teacher, pianist and music theorist died Jan. 3, 1997 in Trempealeau, Wisconsin. Known for founding the influential Yale ''Journal of Music Theory'', he is also widely appreciated by legions of piano teachers and their students for his hundreds of imaginative piano pieces in varied contemporary styles, accessible to young players. These he composed for the ''Frances Clark Library for Piano Students'' and for the National Keyboard Arts Associates. Other, much more major works, both sacred and secular, are performed frequently throughout the country. In 1983 he was honored by the Yale Music Alumni Association for his distinguished contributions. A ''David Kraehenbuehl Memorial Fund'' (call 415-392-3340) has been established by the Music Teachers' Association of California (MTAC) to support its composer-related programs and projects. His friends and associates express sympathy to his family.
