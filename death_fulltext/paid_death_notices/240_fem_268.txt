        LAZARUS--Eleanor S. The American Jewish Committee mourns with great sadness the passing of Eleanor Lazarus, a member of our Board of Governors who served in a range of leadership posts. Eleanor was profoundly dedicated to advancing human rights and strengthening intergroup understanding. All of us at AJC were uplifted by her leadership, friendship, and counsel. We send our heartfelt condolences to her husband David and to her family. E. Robert Goodkind, AJC President David A. Harris, AJC Executive Director
