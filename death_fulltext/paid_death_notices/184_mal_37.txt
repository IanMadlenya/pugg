        WADE-Charles. No one could have known a more loyal and sincere friend than Charles Wade. We had known each other for over 30 years and had worked together for over 20 years. He was a man of integrity and dignity; his sincerity, along with his insight, were appreciated by all who knew him. He will be deeply missed. My deepest condolences to his family and to his son, Charles Wade Jr. Robert Shapiro City Center Real Estate, Inc.
