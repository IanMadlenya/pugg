Adelson, a distinguished professor of Medieval Studies and History at City College and the Graduate Center of the City of New York. A great humanitarian and advocate of Israel, Howard provided years of service to The Hebrew University, chairing the Academic Advisory Committee for the Rothberg International School. As President of The Anna Sobol Levy Foundation, which enables young officers from the U.S. armed services to study at Hebrew University, Howard strengthened the relationship between the US and Israel. Howard was a longstanding member of AFHU's Board and Executive Committee and an honorary vice president. He received an honorary fellowship from Hebrew University in 1985 in recognition of his tireless efforts to enhance the University's growth and global reputation. We extend our deepest sympathies to Howard's beloved children, Mark and Sara, his grandchild and the entire family. American Friends of The Hebrew Unversity Ira Lee Sorkin, President Keith L.
