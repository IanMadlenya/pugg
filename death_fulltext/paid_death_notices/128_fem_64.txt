        STAFF-Sonya. The Directors and Staff of YIVO are saddened by the loss of our friend and colleague, Sonya Staff. With intelligence and good humor, she carried on her family's tradition of furthering the rich culture of Eastern European Jewish life and Yiddishkeit. She was a generous supporter of YIVO's efforts in this regard, just as she undertook to help other organizations and individuals who shared her depth of commitment. Sonya Staff was a wonderful role model in her work as a businesswoman and volunteer, uncompromising in her honesty, and deeply committed to a vision of a social and political world that has yet to arrive. We are grateful for the privilege of having been associated with her, and send our deepest condolences to her daughter, Eve Rosahn, and her entire family. Bruce Slovin, Chairman Tom L. Freudenheim, Executive Director YIVO Institute for Jewish Research
