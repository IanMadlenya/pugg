        KUBA--Donald L. The firm of Warshaw Burstein Cohen Schlesinger & Kuh has lost a loyal friend and colleague for over 40 years, whose early death we deeply mourn. A scholarly lawyer, a creative problem solver, Don was firm but self-effacing, effective but courteous, and always tenacious. He applied his tenacity for the benefit of the firm, wherever needed. He also became a scholar in the field of fine arts, which became his avocation. A gentle man, we will miss him. All of us express our sympathy to Leona, Melissa and David.
