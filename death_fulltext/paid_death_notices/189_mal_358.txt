        MURRAY-Reverend Monsignor James J. The Ladies of Charity of the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York celebrate the life of Monsignor Murray while we record with sorrow our loss as he enters eternal life and receives his much deserved reward in the company of family and friends. We shall miss the guidance he provided and the friendship we shared for more than 28 years. Dorothea A. McElduff Archdiocesan President Susan Marie Grady Executive Director
