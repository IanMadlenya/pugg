        MALLOY-Edwin A. The Rabbis, Officers, Trustees and members of Congregation Emanu-El mourn the passing of our respected and revered Honorary President, Edwin A. Malloy. A man of impeccable character and uncompromising integrity, he spoke truth for truth alone was in his heart. His intellectual gifts were abundant and to all problems he brought wisdom and compassion. His almost three decades of devoted service on our Board and the shining years of his presidency yielded multiple blessings for our Congregation. He will be remembered with love and named with benediction. At the side of his beloved Susan, his wonderful children, Jennifer and Timon, and all the other members of the family, we weep at his death while thanking God for his life. Dr. Ronald B. Sobel, Senior Rabbi David E. Marrus, President Herbert C. Bernard, Secretary
