        LASKEY-Norman F., M.D. It is with profound sorrow that The Mount Sinai Alumni mourns the passing of our distinguished friend and colleague. Dr. Laskey came to Mount Sinai in 1925 as a resident in the Department of Surgery, and devoted the next 60 years to clinical teaching and the excellent and compassionate care of his patients. Greatly admired as both clinician and teacher, he will be remembered most fondly for his commitment to his patients and to the institution, as well as for his kind and gentle nature. He will be missed. Our sincere condolences are extended to his entire family. Jeffrey S. Freed, M.D., Pres. William G. Stein, M.D., V.P. Maria L. Padilla, M.D., Secy. George Raptis, M.D., Treas.
