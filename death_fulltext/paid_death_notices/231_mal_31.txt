        KUPFERBERG - Jack. We mourn the loss of Jack Kupferberg, a great friend and supporter of Safe Space (formerly Center for Children+Families). We are truly grateful for his commitment as Board Chair for many years, personal support, and dedication to our mission. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Kupferberg family.
