        HOROWITZ--Ruth. On July 23, 2005, age 94. The NYU Steinhardt School of Education mourns the loss of our dear friend and benefactor, Ruth Horowitz. Author, teacher, lecturer, teaching supervisor, and Steinhardt alumna, Ruth mentored hundreds of students and influenced generations of teachers and teacher educators. Ruth's legacy and vision will always be a part of us through the Ruth Horowitz Center for Teacher Development, which she endowed, and the scholarship fund she so generously established for teachers in elementary education. Ruth was a great lady; a devoted and passionate teacher and friend. We will miss her. Our deepest condolences to her sister, Rosslyn.
