        SEIDMAN--Bert. The officers, staff and members of the Jewish Labor Committee note with deep sadness the passing of Bert Seidman, a Vice President and longtime leader in our organization. For many years active in our Washington DC Chapter, he was a thoughtful and dedicated trade unionist, whose wisdom and commitment to improving the lives of working men and women made a difference for millions of workers. We extend our deepest condolences to his children, and to all of his family and friends. Stuart Appelbaum, President Avram B. Lyon, Exec. Dir.
