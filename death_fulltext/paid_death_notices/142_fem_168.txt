        EDELSTEIN-Tiby. We mourn the loss of Tiby, longtime employee and dear friend. Her many years with us proved her to be competent, dedicated and a wonderful, loyal worker. The handpicked greeting cards in her large, redinked handwriting will no longer arrive-we shall miss them. Along with the frequent calls we made, we shall also miss the yearly birthday, September 23rd, celebration we looked forward to eagerly. She will always be in our thoughts. Lee and Lou Kuhn Betty Schoenfeld
