The Trustees of the Winston Churchill Foundation of the U.S. record their deep sadness at the death of Pamela Harriman, the mother of our fellow Trustee, Winston Churchill, who was herself a member of the Board for many years. Her deep interest and generous support helped make the Churchill Foundation Scholarship Program one of the most successful and prestigious of its kind. Our condolences to her family. John L.
