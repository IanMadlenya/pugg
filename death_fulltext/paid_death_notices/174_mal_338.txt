        SWARTZ-Robert. With the passing of Robert Swartz, Bed Bath & Beyond has lost not only a dedicated and extremely capable director, but we have lost a wonderful and loyal friend. From the day the company opened its first door in 1971, Bob was always there to lend his wisdom and experience in his own kind way, never seeking anything in return. His contribution to our success will never be forgotten. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his devoted wife, Inez, their children and grandchildren.
