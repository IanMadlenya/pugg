        FREEMAN--Elizabeth. The Board of Trustees, management and staff of The Jewish Home and Hospital Lifecare System extends its deepest sympathies to the Freeman family; parents and John and Josephine (Dodi), son David and wife Ellen on the passing of their beloved daughter and sister Elizabeth. For almost 70 years the Freeman family has provided a strong and valued legacy of leadership and support to the Jewish Home. John has been an active trustee since 1960, currently serving on the Westchester (Sarah Neuman Center) Divisional Board. He was Jewish Home Board president from 1981 to '85 and his years of service were integral to the growth and development of the Home. His father, Charles also served as Board president from 1935 to 1940. David, continuing the family tradition, joined the Board in 1988 and serves as the chair of the Nominating Committee, member of the Marketing Committee and trustee of the System Board. Dodi is an original member of the Friends of Sarah Neuman, an auxiliary dedicated to high quality resident life at Sarah Neuman. Since joining the Friends, she has served as the group's historian and on numerous special event committees including their first ''Gourmet Tasting'' Fundraiser. We are grateful for the many contributions this involved, caring family has made to our System and our thoughts will be with John, Dodi, David and the entire Freeman family during their time of loss.
