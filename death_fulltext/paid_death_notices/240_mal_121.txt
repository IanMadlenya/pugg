        WALLACH--Ira D. The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn the loss of Ira D. Wallach, who was a friend, colleague, and benefactor of this institution for many years. With his wife, Miriam, he demonstrated a keen interest in art through philanthropy, generously donating works to the collection and creating endowments to support acquisitions as well as special exhibitions, publications, and education programs in the area of Asian art. He will be greatly missed. We extend our condolences to his wife and to the entire family. James R. Houghton, Chrman Philippe de Montebello, Dir Emily K. Rafferty, President
