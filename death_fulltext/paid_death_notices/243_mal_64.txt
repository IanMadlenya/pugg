        ROSIER--Peter, physician with unbridled passions and intolerance for injustice, died tragically March 15 at 65. With indomitable will he traveled to the tropics in his last days though paralyzed and ailing. An alumnus of Dartmouth, SUNY - Downstate, and Duke, his practice in pathology in Ft. Myers, Florida set a high standard in medicine. After his beloved Patricia (Delman) died he created homes in Manhattan and Massachusetts with the former Eleni Goltsis. In 2005 he moved to Arizona with wife Gail Fouts. Closest to his heart, children Elizabeth and Jacob mirror his charisma and restless capacity for kindness. Elizabeth's partner, Ruth Sternberg, Jacob's wife Vicki, grandsons Patrick and Jackson are richer for his love as are stepchildren Connor Strobel and Logan Bernstein. A donation to Memorial Sloan - Kettering, Doctors Without Borders, or Hospiceof-the-Valley, Phoenix would honor his noble spirit.
