        COPLAN--Alfred I. The Officers, Board of Directors and Staff of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) mourn the passing of our friend and Board member, Alfred I. Coplan. As a leading member of the Board's Investment Committee, Al's tireless devotion and great financial acumen helped safeguard the future of JDC's work in Jewish communities around the world, bettering the lives of hundreds of thousands of his fellow Jews. He truly embodied the traditional principle of ''All Jews are responsible for one another.'' We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Helen, his children, Lee Coplan and Jan Rivitz, and the entire family. Eugene J. Ribakoff, President Jonathan W. Kolker, Chairman of the Board Steven Schwager, Executive Vice President
