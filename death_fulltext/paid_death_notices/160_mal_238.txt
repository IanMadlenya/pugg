        AREFIN-Tony (Abed). Ogilvy & Mather Advertising mourns the sudden and tragic loss of our friend and partner Tony Arefin, 38, on Friday, May 19. He was an exceptional creative talent who has left us a legacy of brilliant work ranging from award-winning advertising and design to celebrated multimedia projects and artistic exhibitions. He will be remembered by us all, for his love of life, his family, basketball, and the high ideals that drove his quest for artistic perfection. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to his loving sons Rafi and Sami, his wife Amanda, his parents Shamsul and Abeda, and his sister Ayesha. Olgilvy has established a memorial trust on behalf of Tony's children. Donations may be sent to Ogilvy c/o The Tony Arefin Memorial Fund, 309 W. 49 St, NY NY 10019.
