        RAFSKY-William L. Greatly admired, respected and loving uncle, a true role model and a statesman and civic leader of immense accomplishments. To our dear aunt Selma, to whom he was an adoring husband of sixty years, to his devoted son Larry and special granddaughter Sara, we extend our heartfelt sympathies. He was a unique human being and will be sorely missed. Lainie and Victor
