        COHEN-Gerald, Ph.D. The Estelle and Daniel Maggin Department of Neurology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine deeply mourn the passing of Dr. Gerald Cohen, a famous biochemist in the field of Parkinson's Disease.

He was also an expert in alcohol toxicity. A prolific writer, he authored over 250 scientific publications. He received numerous awards including a Javits Award for excellence in scientific research, and honors from the Oxygen Society. His most cherished prize was an Award for Scientific Journalism. He will be remembered for his sharp mind and dedication to research by colleagues and students. We extend our condolences to his wife, Dorothy, and his son, Kevin. C.
