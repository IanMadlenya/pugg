        SCHWARTZ-Paul. We extend heartfelt condolences to Dr. William Schwartz on the loss of his beloved father. As a Silver Founder of the medical center, together with his wife Debbie, who chairs our International Women's Health Board, the Schwartzs have personified the highest values of Jewish tradition and ethics, which they learned from their dear father. May Bill, Debbie, wife Gladys and son Martin be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. American Committee for Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem
