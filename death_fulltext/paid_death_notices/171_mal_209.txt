        CLAYSON-David Merrill. The Boards, Faculty, and Staff of Weill Medical College of Cornell University and New York-Presbyterian Hospital mourn the passing of David Clayson, Ph.D., professor emeritus of clinical psychology in psychiatry. For 25 years, from 1968 to 1993, Dr. Clayson was head of psychology and director of training in psychology at the Payne Whitney Clinic, and taught many who have become leaders in the field. In 1983, he became the first member of the Department of Psychiatry and the first and only clinical psychologist and nonphysician to receive the Medical College's highest teaching honor, the Elliott Hochstein Award. On February 5 of this year, he became the first recipient of the Dean's Award for Lifetime Achievement in Teaching. We extend our deepest condolences to his brother, nieces, and nephews. Antonio M. Gotto, Jr., M.D., Dean Weill Medical College of Cornell University Herbert Pardes, M.D., President and CEO NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital Jack D.
