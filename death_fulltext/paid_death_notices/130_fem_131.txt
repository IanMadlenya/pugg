        WOLKIND-Sylvia. A woman who loved her family above all else, loved life and would make a detour anytime, anywhere to play golf at some wonderful course she had not yet seen (and there weren't too many of those) had a sudden, tragic end. She was truly a woman of valor. Those fortunate to know her will never forget her. A great loss to her husband of fifty-nine years Murray Wolkind, son Richard Wolkind, daughter Dale Kramer, daughter-in-law Marta Wolkind, son-in-law Stephen Kramer and grandson Bryan Wolkind. Goodbye Sylvia. Services will be held Thursday, November 20th, 12:30PM at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street at Amsterdam Avenue, New York.
