        LEON-David, Hazzan. The Cantors Assembly records with sorrow the passing of our Past President (1969-1971) and revered colleague of over five decades. A wonderful Hazzan, he quietly and gently served the spiritual needs of the Jewish community of Bridgeport, Connectucut for over forty years with dignity, warmth and care. His kindness, his humanity and his caring inspired us all. We extend our sympathy to his family and loved ones. May his memory abide as a blessing. Hazzan Sheldon Levin, Pres. Hazzan Stephen J. Stein, Executive Vice President Hazzan Abraham B. Shapiro, Executive Administrator
