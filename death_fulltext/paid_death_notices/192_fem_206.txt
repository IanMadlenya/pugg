        ELLSTEIN-Sylvia Regan, on January 18, 2003. Playwright, lifetime member of the Dramatists Guild, widow of musician-composer Abraham Ellstein, with whom she colaborated on the Broadway musical ''Great To Be Alive'', and the opera ''The Golem''. Miss Regan began her theater career as an actress with Paul Muni, and later worked with Orson Welles and his Mercury Theater. ''Morning Star'', her first Broadway play, was produced sixty years ago, and was recently revived, with great success, by Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater. The Chicago Lyric Opera is currently developing it for production. Her play ''The Fifth Season'' was a long-running Broadway hit, and along with ''Morning Star'' continues to enjoy productions abroad. Miss Regan is survived by three brothers, a niece and nephews. She was ninety-four years old, and died of natural causes.
