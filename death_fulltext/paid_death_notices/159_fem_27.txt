        ABRAMOWICZ-Dina. The National Yiddish Book Center mourns the passing of Dina Abramowicz. She knew more about Yiddish books and culture than any person alive, and graciously shared her knowledge with three generations of scholars. May her memory be a blessing for us all. Aaron Lansky, President National Yiddish Book Center Amherst, MA
