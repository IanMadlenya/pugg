        MILLER-Dr. Bernard. November 11, 2002, age 88. A dentist by profession and a veteran of World War II, he was the quintessential gentleman who adored his family, friends, the arts, New York City and East Hampton. As he was graceful in life, so, too, he was graceful in death. He is survived by his sister Lillian Berlin, brother Dr. Jack Miller, grand-nephew David Siegel, and nieces and nephews Marian and Bob Siegel, Marjorie and Paul Berko, Susan and Mark Gropper, Dr. Dorothy and Dr. Mitchell Gail, Mary and Dr. Edward Berlin, Grace and Dr. Robert Miller, Joan and Russell Killough, and Kristin and Andrew Miller. Memorial contributions may be made to Calvary Hospital Patient Activity Fund, 1740 Eastchester Road, Bronx, New York 10461.
