        SOLOMON-George J. A superb lawyer whose skill, integrity and dedication enhanced the profession he loved. He was my true friend and partner for the forty-five years we practiced law together. His loyalty to his family, clients, and colleagues was remarkable. He never had another agenda. Justin N.
