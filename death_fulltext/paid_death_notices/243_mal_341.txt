        SCHACTER--Herbert, age 79 died on April 24, 2007. Beloved husband and best friend of Barbara; loving and devoted father of Ira and his wife Janice, Alan and his wife Sherri and Howard and his girlfriend Deena; and doting ''Papa'' to Michael, Matthew, Arielle and Jared, his adored grandchildren. They adored him. We will miss him everyday of our lives. His second family consisted of his working life: his partners, office staff and his many clients. He was a CPA and a partner in the firm of Needleman & Schacter for more than 30 years. He loved his work and he loved the wonderful people he worked with. He had a full and rich life. After graduating from City College he served in the US Army for two years, starting his accounting career after his discharge. He and Barbara would have celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary this coming June 15th. Theirs was a 51 year long love affair. He passed away from the ravages of esophageao cancer. May he rest in peace.
