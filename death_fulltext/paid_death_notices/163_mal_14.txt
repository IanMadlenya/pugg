        DAVIS-Howland. The Board of Trustees of The New York Institute for Special Education (founded in 1831 as The New York Institute for the Education of the Blind) records with deep regret the death of its beloved and distinguished member. Mr. Davis was a dedicated friend of the Institute and he ably assisted in guiding its growth as a trustee and member of nummerous committees for over 45 years. His guidance and friendship will be sorely missed. Our sympathy is extended to his wife Frances and to his family.
