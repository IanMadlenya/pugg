        LONG-Augustus C. The Board of Trustees, Faculty, and Staff of New York-Presbyterian Hospital are saddened by the death of Augustus C. Long, a former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Texaco, who was a Trustee of The Presbyterian Hospital in the City of New York beginning in 1955, President of the Hospital beginning in 1961, and Chairman of the Board of Trustees from 1970 to 1974. Mr. Long was a greatly esteemed leader who presided skillfully over the Hospital's service to patients and the community, and who directed the institution through some of its most vigorous development. The Augustus Long Medical Library at the Columbia Presbyterian site of the Hospital was named in his honor. His contributions and devotion to the Hospital's mission are still deeply appreciated. We extend our condolences to his family. John J. Mack Chairman, Board of Trustees Herbert Pardes, M.D. President and CEO New York-Presbyterian Hospital
