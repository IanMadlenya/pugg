        SCHWARTZ-Jerome M. Born August 22, 1913 in Brooklyn, NY. Died August 28, 1997 in Washington, D.C. A man who valued his role as husband and father not only for more than the success he achieved in business but also more than his splendid array of creative talent. This beautiful man-beloved father of Leland, Andrew and the late Kenneth, Gregory and Barry and adored husband of Stella-will, until we meet again, be held precious in our memory and very deeply missed. Interment will take place at the New Mt. Carmel Cemetery in Queens, Wednesday at 2pm.
