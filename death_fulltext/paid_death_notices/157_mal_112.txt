        SMIT-Leo. The directors and officers of the Aaron Copland Fund for Music deeply regret the passing of our colleague and founding board member Leo Smit. A composer and pianist of skill and sensitivity, Leo was fervently devoted to the art of music and especially to the work of contemporary American composers. He communicated his love of life through music with courage and good humor. Leo Smit was an exceptional musician and very special person who will be missed and remembered by all who knew him.
