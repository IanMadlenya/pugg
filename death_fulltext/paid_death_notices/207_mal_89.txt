A pioneer in cellular immunology, his laboratory discovered that white cells release messenger molecules (cytokines) that cause fever, provoke inflammation and incite tumors. A score of agents now used to treat cancer, arthritis and autoimmune diseases are directed against these molecules. Their development is his intellectual legacy.
