        PREISKEL--Robert, a friend for more than 60 years, has left us. We knew and admired him as a colleague, sometime golfer, and above all, a fervent participant in humanitarian causes. We extend our sympathy to John, Ricky, Marion, and Malachi. Rita and Leon Silverman
        PREISKEL--Robert, beloved husband of the late Barbara Scott Preiskel, dedicated father of John and Richard Preiskel and treasured grandfather to Malakai Preiskel, passed away on August 21, 2006. Former Co-Managing partner of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and Jacobson, past President of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, an invaluable board member and advisor to numerous non-profit and public interest organizations, Bob will be fondly remembered for his compassion, generosity, insight and humility. A veteran of ''Freedom Summer'' in 1964, he remained steadfast in his efforts to alleviate poverty and to establish justice and racial equality. A true pioneer and leader among equals since his days as a law student at Yale University, Bob will be deeply missed by all who had the privilege and honor of knowing him. Pursuant to his wishes, no funeral services will be held. Contributions in his memory may be made to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the Robert and Barbara Preiskel Memorial Fund at the New York Community Trust and to the Supportive Children's Advocacy Network (SCAN). A public memorial service will be held in the fall.
