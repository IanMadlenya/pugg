        LEWIS-Shari. The Covenant Foundation mourns the untimely passing of Shari Lewis, whose talents as a puppeteer and creator of award-winning children's television were universally known and applauded. Less well known was her deeply Jewish spirit. The daugher of a Rabbi, Shari used her enormous gifts for the Jewish people. We are proud to have facilitated the creation of one of her life's dreams: her enduring Jewish children's videos and teaching materials, broadcast nationally as PBS specials, ''Lambchop's Special Chanukah'' and ''Shari's Passover Surprise.'' Her legacy will live on in the hearts of children. Susan Crown, President Eli N. Evans, Chairman Dr. Judith Ginsburg, Executive Director
