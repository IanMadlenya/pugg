        ADLER--Goldie. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Jean Gluck and Eddie Adler on the passing of her beloved sister and his dear mother. Mrs. Adler was a warm, kindhearted and caring person. She had the unique ability to bring an instant smile to anyone who had the good fortune of knowing her, whether it was a co-worker or a family member. Likewise, Jean and her husband Eugen have devoted their life to bringing joy, happiness and peace of mind to countless individuals in Israel and in their home community. Through their sponsorship of the Gluck Pediatric Pavillion and the Family Waiting Room in the Jesselson Heart Center, the people of Jerusalem have been the recipients of Jean and Eugen's outstretched hand of kindness. May the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. American Committee for Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem Erica Jesselson, Chair Menno Ratzker, Pres.
