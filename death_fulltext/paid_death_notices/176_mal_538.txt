        CROWN-Joseph H. A man of great strength, rich talents and devotion to family died at age 93, surrounded by his family, shortly after Yom Kippur in Cuernavaca. His professional career was marked by his passion and dedication to justice and civil liberties, from which he was never deterred by his work in the sophisticated and highly-regarded analysis of taxation issues. His energies were invaluable for the National Lawyers' Guild. His voice was among those that appealed to the President for an end to the arms embargo to Republican Spain. His insight and wisdom were the foundation for the work of the Lawyers' Committee Against the War in Vietnam to which his comprehension of constitutional law was crucial. His continued writing until very recently in both the Mexican and American press gave rational and effective expression to the issues of environmental deterioration. His involvement in current events and his interest in chess continued until his final days. His love and devotion to his family and friends are not diminished by his death.
