        FRIEDMAN -- Jack. The Greater New York Health Care Facilities Association is profoundly saddened by the passing of its President, Jack Friedman. He will be fondly remembered as a successful and generous businessman, a scholar, a good samaritan and a fine leader and friend. He was a devoted student of the Talmud, a philanthropist and a tireless advocate for compassionate, high quality care for the ill and infirm. We also thank him for his many years of invaluable contributions to our Association and the long term care industry. We offer our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Esther, and their children and grandchildren. May he rest in peace. John Chobor, Executive Dir.
