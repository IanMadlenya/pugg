        RUTTENBERG--Derald. The faculty and staff of the Department of Medicine at large and the Division of Hematology/Oncology, deeply mourns the passing of our visionary benefactor, Derald H. Ruttenberg. His keen intellect, insightful curiosity, clever wit and compassionate generosity will forever serve to inspire our community. His extraordinary leadership and tireless commitment to scholarship, along with his profound belief in the potential of people to make a difference in the outlook of patients who suffer from malignant disease, through discoveries in research and improvement in patient care, will never be forgotten. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to his wife, Janet; to his sons, Eric and John; to his daughters, Katherine and Hattie, and to the entire Ruttenberg family. Drs. Paul Klotman and Jonathan Licht
