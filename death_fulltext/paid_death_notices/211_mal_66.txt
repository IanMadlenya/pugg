        CARTIER - BRESSON -- Henri. The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art mourn the loss of Henri Cartier-Bresson, whose passionate curiosity and uncanny talent changed the way we see the world. A prisioner of war for part of World War II, he discovered at its end that the Museum, believing that he had been killed, was planning a posthumous restrospective of his photographs. Thus began a close relationship that thrived for six decades and led to major exhibitions in 1947, 1968, and 1987. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife Martine Franck, daughter Melanie, and their family. David Rockefeller, Chairman Emeritus Agnes Gund President Emerita Ronald S. Lauder, Chairman Robert B. Menschel, President Peter Norton, Chairman of the Trustee Committee on Photography Glenn D. Lowry, Director The Museum of Modern Art, New York
        CARTIER - BRESSON -- Henri. It is with profound sorrow that we note the passing of Henri Cartier-Bresson. For all of us at ICP, and the photographic community at large, Cartier-Bresson was a monumental figure who changed the history of photography and whose profound influence will long be felt. He was a visionary witness to our time; a superb artist who brought to his work unsurpassed integrity and a marvelous celebration of life. Henri's pictures have become icons and will continue to provide inspiration and enjoyment to millions. His lively presence will be deeply missed and we will all be less as a result of his absence. The staff and Trustees of ICP express their heartfelt condolences to Martine and Melanie and to their extended family and friends around the world. Cornell Capa, Founding Director Willis E. Hartshorn, Director International Center of Photography
