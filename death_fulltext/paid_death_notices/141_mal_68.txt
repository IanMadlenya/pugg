        BAUM-Joe. The Citymeals-onWheels family is sadly diminished by the loss of one of its own, Joe Baum, our Board member and long-time friend. Joe's heart was as expansive as his vision. His loving generosity to New York's homebound elderly was abundant and ceaseless. His Rainbow Room has been a gift to our Women's Power Lunch for over a decade and some of our most glittering and fruitful dinners took place at one or another of his magnificent restaurants. Our thoughts are with Ruth, Hillary, Charles, Edward, and his many devoted colleagues and staff. We will miss Joe very much. His spirit of fun, mischief and incomparable hospitality will be with us forever. Gael Greene, Chairman Preston Robert Tisch, President Marcia Stein, Executive Director
