        FRYER-Robert S. November 18, 1920-May 28, 2000. The Producer Circle mourns the loss of our cherished colleague, the esteemed film and theatrical producer, whose films include The Boston Strangler, The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, Travels With My Aunt, and The Boys From Brazil; and original Broadway productions include A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Advise and Consent, A Passage To India, Redhead, Sweet Charity, Auntie Mame, Mame, Chicago, Sweeney Todd, and Noises Off, among many others. He was a great gentleman and we will miss his humor and his sage advice. Our condolences to his sister Eleanor Massell, his nephew Roger, and niece DeeDee. God bless you, Bobby.
