        FISHER--Max. Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, mourns the loss of a towering figure in American Jewish life. A man of multiple interests and extraordinary generosity, Max Fisher's impact has been felt in this country and in Israel for nearly a century and will be felt far into the future. We are most grateful for his devotion to the Hadassah Medical Organization in Jerusalem and the numerous gifts made by him and his beloved wife, Marjorie, to assist various medical disciplines from cardiology to ophthalmology to pediatric neurology. May his name be an eternal blessing and may his loving family be comforted among the mourners of Zion. June Walker National President Hadassah, The Women's Zionist Organization of America
