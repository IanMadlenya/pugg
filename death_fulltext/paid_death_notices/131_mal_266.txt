        TUCHMAN-Lester R., M.D. The Trustees, Faculty and Staff of The Mount Sinai Medical Center deeply mourn the passing of our esteemed colleague Lester R. Tuchman, M.D., Clinical Professor Emeritus in Medicine, whose association with Mount Sinai spanned seven decades. After earning his medical degree at Columbia University, Dr. Tuchman joined Mount Sinai in 1927 as House Surgeon and became known for his leadership among the attending staff and his devotion to Mount Sinai and its Alumni, who honored him in 1966 with their highest award, the Jacobi Medallion. He played a pivotal role in the establishment of our academic affiliation with Elmhurst Hospital Center, a relationship which he guided as Elmhurst's Director of Medicine during the formative years that were the foundation for what has become one of the most productive associations of its kind, significantly enhancing the delivery of health care services in Queens. An outstanding internist, he was known for both his devotion to his patients and for his clinical skills as well as for his dedication to the dissemination of medical knowledge, exemplified by his many years of service as editor of The Mount Sinai Journal of Medicine, his teaching, and the establishment in his name and honor of the Lester R. Tuchman Scholarship and Student Loan Fund at Mount Sinai by the Esther Simon Charitable Trust. He will be remembered fondly and he will be sorely missed. We extend our sincerest sympathy to his children, Lucy, Jessica and Alma, to his sisters, Martha and Lucille, and to the entire family. Stephen M. Peck, Chairman John W. Rowe, M.D., President Arthur H. Rubenstein, MBBCh, Dean Barry R. Freedman, Executive Vice-President Wendy Z. Goldstein, Director Alan L. Schiller, M.D., President, Medical Board
