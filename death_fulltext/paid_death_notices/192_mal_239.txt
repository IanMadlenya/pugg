        WALTER-Otto L. The Board of Directors of the German American Chamber of Commerce is deeply saddened by the apssing of its long-time friend and supporter, Otto L. Walter. He joined the Board of Directors of the Chamber in 1961 and continued to work tirelessly on German-American relations. He was an authority on international and tax law, a writer, a lecturer and philanthropist. His personal engagement combined with his experience and knowledge has been invaluable to the Chamber. Our deepest sympathies go to his wife and family. The Board of Directors, German American Chamber of Commerce E.A. Sekulow, Chairman W. Walbroel, President
