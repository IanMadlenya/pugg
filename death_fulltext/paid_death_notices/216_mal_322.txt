        RAND--Harry I. Died on January 22, 2005, at the age of 92. A graduate of CCNY (1932) and NYU Law School (1936), he was a lover of humanity, poetry, music and always the law. Harry worked in the New Deal from 1938-1948 and then in private practice until his retirement in 2004. During that time, he represented scores of people before loyalty security boards and in federal courts during the McCarthy era. He was a pioneer in the field of art recovery law and represented publishing companies in many copyright matters. Harry was a general practitioner in the truest sense, enjoying and mastering every aspect of the practice of law. A consummate litigator and graceful advocate, whose writing was known for its simplicity and clarity. In addition, Harry was a revered teacher to many younger lawyers. He is survived by his wife of 66 years, Dr. Anna T. Rand; his children Steven (Marlyse), Deborah, Naomi (David); his grandchildren Sascha (Kalpana), Travis and Cody; his sister Jeanne; his in-laws Sam and Adele, to whom he was the most wonderful friend, husband, father, brother and grandfather imaginable. We are all proud and grateful to have loved and been loved by Harry. A memorial service will be announced later.
