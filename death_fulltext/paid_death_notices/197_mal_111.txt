        HIRSCH--Jack. Heartfelt condolences to the Hirsch family on the loss of Jack Hirsch, husband of Gladys, father of Stuart and Bryan, brother of Benjamin Hirsch and our beloved Reverend A. Asher Hirsch, Golden Founder and Director of Religious Affairs at Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem. As a Diamond Founder of the Medical Center together with his wife Gladys, Jack inspired many to follow his lead. Involved in nurturing the future of the Jewish community, he set a high standard and will be greatly missed. May the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. The family requests that donations be made to Shaare Zedek Medical Center. American Committee for Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem >>AD#
