        SPRITZ--Marilyn Karmason. We shared our lives with you; the joys, the laughter, the intimacies, the occasional sadness. Our children grew up together and we grew with you and with them. Yours was an extraordinary mind, an endless compassion, and a boundless love for others. Our sadness is eased only by the memories. Our hearts go out to Norton, Nina and her family, and all who knew Marilyn. All of our lives are diminished by our loss. Shirley and Martin
