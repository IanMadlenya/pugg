        KROLLAGE-Arthur H. of Scott's Beach, Long Island, a decorated World War II veteran and employee of the New York Times for 37 years, died on May 2, 2003 at the age of 81 after an eight year battle with cancer. Mr. Krollage began his career with the New York Times as a security guard. For 32 years he served as the executive in charge of security and reception for the executive floor. He served under publishers Arthur Hays Sulzberger, Orvil Dryfoos and Arthur Ochs Sulzberger. Mr. Krollage hired and trained many office boys who went on to achieve prominent positions within the company. He also served as the Chairman of the Supervisory Committee for the New York Times Credit Union. He retired in 1985. Gay Talese, in his book about the New York Times ''The Kingdom and the Power'' once described Mr. Krollage as, ''polite, soft spoken; an individual with...reddish hair who seems large and tall enough to redirect angry visitors from the street who occasionally intrude to complain about the state of the world or about one of John Oakes's editorial indiscretions against some distant sultan.'' Known for his friendly manner and dedication to his job, Mr. Krollage, seated at his desk outside the publisher's office on the 14th floor, greeted presidents, heads of state and some of the most famous personalities of our time. During WWII, Mr. Krollage served as a corporal in the Army Air Force and was a decorated veteran of campaigns in Bismark, Archipelago, Luzon, New Guinea, the Northern Solomons, the Southern Philippines, and the Western Pacific. He was honored with seven medals of valor. All who knew Mr. Krollage will mourn his passing. A dedicated family man, he is survived by his wife of 57 years, Gladys; two sons, Arthur and Robert; a daughter, Susanne Avino; six grandchildren and countless friends.
