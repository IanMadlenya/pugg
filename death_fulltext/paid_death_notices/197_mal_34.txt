        TERRY--Wallace. The staff of ''Parade'' magazine mourns the loss of a friend and colleague. In his nearly 15 years as a Contributing Editor to Parade, Wallace Terry helped its readers bridge a racial divide through coverage of civil rights and influential African-Americans, from entertainers such as Quincy Jones, Morgan Freeman, Stevie Wonder and James Earl Jones to newsmakers including photographer Gordon Parks, Marian Wright Edelman, founder of the Children's Defense Fund and, most recently, Dr. Ruth Simmons, president of Brown University. Wallace Terry should be remembered not only as a champion of civil rights but also as a proud and loving man and an ordained minister who cared deeply about his family, his friends, his neighbors. He will be dearly missed. We extend our sympathies to his wife, Janice, his children and grandchildren. Walter Anderson, Chairman Parade >>AD#
