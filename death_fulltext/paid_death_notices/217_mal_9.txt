        POPE--W. Stuart. Boosey & Hawkes, Inc. notes with sadness the passing of W. Stuart Pope, the company's president from 1964 until his retirement in 1984. From the time he joined Boosey & Hawkes in 1946, he worked tirelessly to promote the performance of contemporary music. Under his leadership, Boosey & Hawkes, Inc. nurtured the careers of many of the 20th century's leading American composers. He will be greatly missed. Jennifer Bilfield, President Boosey & Hawkes
