        WEINER-Dr. Herbert. Beloved husband of Dora; father of Tim, Richard and Tony; grandfather of Daniel, Charlotte, Josh, Stephen, Naomi, Emma and Ruby. Died peacefully at home on November 12. Scientist, scholar, teacher and researcher, he pursued knowledge with passion. He loved art, music, food, wine, skiing, hiking and fishing, and above all friends and family. The quality of his mind was outdone only by the capacity of his heart. Recognized by colleagues as the intellectual leader in his field, and remembered by his family with deep love. Born in Vienna, educated at Harvard and Columbia, chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at Montefiore Hospital in New York, and for 20 years at UCLA Neuropsychiatric and Brain Research Institutes, he sought and won understanding of how the brain and body orchestrate illness. To continue that search, in lieu of flowers, contributions may be sent to the Herbert Weiner Early Career Award, supporting promising young researchers, C/O the American Psychosomatic Society, 6728 Old McLean Village Drive, McLean, VA. 22101-3906.
