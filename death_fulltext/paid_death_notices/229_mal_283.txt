        FURMAN -- Seymour, MD. The President, Board of Trustees, and the entire Montefiore Medical Center community are profoundly saddened by the death of Seymour Furman, MD, an esteemed colleague and friend. Dr. Furman, on the faculty at Montefiore for half a century, was internationally renowned as an expert on pacemakers and related technologies. He developed the modern pace making system to stimulate the heart through plastic-covered wires inserted through veins into the heart, avoiding the need for open chest surgery. His groundbreaking work was a prelude to what today is the miniaturized pacemaker. Dr. Furman was predeceased by his wife, the former Evelyn Katz, in 2002. Our sincere and heartfelt condolences are extended to his sons Bruce, Neil and Gary and to his entire family. Spencer Foreman, MD, President Jay B. Langner, Chairman Board of Trustees Montefiore Medical Center
