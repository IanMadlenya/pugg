        AGNELLI - Giovanni. Con summate businessman and industrialist, Philanthropist, world leader, automobile magnate and enthusiast, art collector, bon vivant, connoisseur of all the arts from publishing to fashion, sportsman, patriot and soldier-Giovanni Agnelli lived life fully in all its dimensions and possibilities. He was a builder and a doer. Architecture, not surprisingly, was one of the art forms that he greatly admired. His deep interest led him to become an important patron in the field and led him to serve many years on the Jury of the distinguished Pritzker Architecture Prize, a position he held at the time of his death. A generation of Pritzker Prize laureates honors and mourns the loss of his intellect and connoisseurship to the field. They are joined in their grief by members of the Pritzker family of Chicago in expressing their deep sadness to his wife Marella and his family. Architecture, Italy and the world will miss the forceful and wise presence of this great man.
