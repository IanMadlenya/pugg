        WALTZMAN-Stuart Alan, M.D., 63. Devoted and adoring husband to Dava, father to Michael, Howard and Lynn, grandfather to Robert, brother to Susan and beloved friend. A graduate of Cornell University, Class of 1957, and Chicago Medical School, Class of 1961, he trained in Psychiatry at Hillside Hospital of Long Island Jewish Medical Center and was commissioned as a Captain in the U.S. Army from 1965 through 1967. He was an accomplished and respected psychiatrist: A former Director of Liaison Psychiatry at Jacobi Hospital, a member of the faculty of the Department of Psychiatry at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Attending Physician at Norwalk Hospital and a Private Practitioner for over 30 years in Westport, CT. He had an uncanny perception of people and a remarkable appreciation for life. He was a lover of sports, classical music, golden retrievers and the Florida Keys. His compassion, loyalty, intelligence, sense of humor and ability to use these traits to interact were a source of pleasure to all who were fortunate enough to have associated with him. To know him was to be enriched beyond comprehension. To have lost him will leave a vacuum never ending. A memorial service will be held on Wednesday, January 5th, at 10 AM, in the Perkin Auditorium at Norwalk Hospital, Norwalk, CT. Donations in his memory may be made to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Box E, 1275 York Ave., NY NY 10021.
