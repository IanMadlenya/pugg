        BLACKBURN-Sara. Died on October 12 at age 66. We mourn the untimely passing of our dear friend. We will miss her wise counsel, her deep intelligence, and her sharp wit. As an editor and writer, she was the midwife to innumerable books and manuscripts. As a friend, she nurtured and tended her relationships in a magnificent way. She showed profound interest in each person she met and had the unusual ability to make each person in her life feel special and important. The world has lost a great human being; we have lost a great friend. A memorial will be held at a future date. For information, Email: forsara@postinbox.com
