        ARPS-Ruth. The Civil Support Division and the Board of Directors of the Legal Aid Society mourn the loss of our dear friend who dedicated 50 years of service to the Society as a staunch supporter and tireless fundraiser. Mrs. Arps chaired the Women's Division during the mid 1970s. She and her late husband, Leslie will be remembered for their invaluable support to the cause of equal justice. We extend our heartfelt condolences to her family and friends.
