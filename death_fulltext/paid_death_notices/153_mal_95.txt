        FOA-Bruno. Age 93. Beloved husband, cherished father, grandfather and great grandfather died October 4, 1999 after a short illness. The emotional center of our family, a family shattered and dispersed by the history of the 20th century across Italy, Israel and the United States, we will forever remember him for his warm and gentle heart, his intellect and wisdow, and above all, for his love of life, optimism and singular charm. He was Italy's youngest full professor (in economics) at the age of 28, an early Zionist & dedicated anti-Fascist, he worked with Chaim Weizmann in London in the 1920s and retained a special devotion to Israel. He came to the U.S. in 1940, worked for the Federal Reserve Board, published and wrote on monetary policy & economic reconstruction in Italy, and as a consulting economist, worked with a variety of international clients. He is also survived by his devoted sister Marina Levi, 99, of Milan. A memorial service will be held Sunday, October 10, 2PM at ''Riverside Memorial Chapel'', 180 West 76 Street, New York City.
