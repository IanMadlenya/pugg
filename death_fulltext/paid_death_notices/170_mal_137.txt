        JAKUBOVITZ-Jerome R. The Board of Directors of Stern College for Women is deeply saddened by the passing of our esteemed member, Jerome Jakubovitz. Jerry was a very special man and we shall sorely miss his wisdom, his business acumen, his commitment to Judaism and education, and his generosity of both heart and spirit. To his beloved family, children and grandchildren, we extend our sincerest sympathy, and to his beautiful wife Joan we send collectively a great, big hug. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Marjorie Blenden SCW Chairman of the Board E.
