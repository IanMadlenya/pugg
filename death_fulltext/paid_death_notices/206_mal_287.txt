        HATFIELD--Robert S. Cornell University mourns the loss of a devoted alumnus and trustee, Robert S. Hatfield, whose leadership, business acumen, and loyalty to the University were extraordinary. A member of the Class of 1937 and a much admired executive with a legendary commitment to public service, he strengthened bonds between Cornell and the corporate world while serving as chairman of the board and chief operating officer of Continental Group, Inc. In 1974 he was elected to the Cornell Board of Trustees. He served on the Board of Overseers of the Cornell Medical College from 1980 to 1982. In 1980, The Continental Group Foundation established the Robert S. Hatfield Fund in Economic Education to honor his legacy and encourage the exchange of ideas between the academic and business communities. In 1984, he was named a Trustee Emeritus. We express our sincere condolences to his wife Roberta (Bobbie) Sullivan Hatfield; his daughters Roberta Williamson, Suzanne Hatfield, and Molly DuPre, and his son Robert Hatfield. Peter Meinig, Chairman Board of Trustees Cornell University Jeffrey S. Lehman, President Cornell University
