        MENUHIN-Yehudi. The Board of Trustees and Staff of Carnegie Hall mourn the passing of violinist Yehudi Menuhin, who performed at the Hall more than 100 times since his 1927 debut on its stage at age 11. He was a great artist who made a unique mark in the world of music, and in the world in which he lived. Yehudi Menuhin had the respect and affection of people all over the world, and we join in celebrating his life, and send his wife and his family our deepest condolences. Isaac Stern, Pres. Sanford I. Weill, Chairman
