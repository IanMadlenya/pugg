        MENDELSON--Michael. On November 4, 2005. The staff and Board of Directors of The New Group Theatre Company are deeply saddened and moved by the passing of our friend, our supporter and the Chairman of our Board, a man who gave generously of himself, shared with us his wonderful family and friends and contributed so much in so many ways to our growth and development. We have all been touched personally and changed profoundly by his acquaintance. He has been our light and our spirit and his memory will be our guide to the future. We extend our heartfelt sympathy and love to his wonderful wife, Mimi, his three children, Shara, Gideon and Lauren, and all of his family and friends who, with us, share so many memories of this great man.
