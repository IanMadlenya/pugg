        PULLES-Alice. We mourn the death of Alice Pulles on April 24, 2003 at age 80. Born in Puerto Rico, she came to the West Side of New York in 1941. She was the first person hired as a community worker by Project FIND in 1967 to seek out and document the plight of the aged in the Clinton neighborhood. She became Supervisor of senior citizen workers and then Director of the Project FIND Coffeehouse in 1972, retiring in the 90's. Our beloved, devoted friend will be remembered always.
