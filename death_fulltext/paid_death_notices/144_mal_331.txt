        SCHREIBER-Aaron M. It is with great sorrow that we note the passing of Aaron M. Schreiber, beloved father of our esteemed Board Member and former Executive Committee Chairman, Simeon Schreiber and father-inlaw of our dedicated Board Member, Rose Schreiber. Mr. Schreiber's benevolent commitment to hosts of Jewish causes both in the United States and Israel characterized his days. His children who continue in his footsteps clearly learned from his magnificent example. May the Almighty comfort the entire family amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
