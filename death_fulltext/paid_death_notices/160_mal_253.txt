        FINKEL-Lawrence S., Ed.D. The College of New Rochelle Community records with sorrow the death of Dr. Larry Finkel, Associate Professor, Graduate School, and Chair of the College Senate. An indefatigable teacher, instructor, and administrator, he devoted his considerable talents to the development of future educational leaders nationally and internationally. With an irrepressible passion for his work and for the College, he has been a unique member of this community, and we have been immeasureably strengthened by his nineteen years with us. We mourn his loss and celebrate his life. Stephen J. Sweeny, Ph.D. President Jean Baptiste Nicholson, OSU Chair, Board of Trustees
