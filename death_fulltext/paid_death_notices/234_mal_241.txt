        REES--Charles H.G. The Officers, Trustees and staff of Riverside Research Institute mourn the passing of Charles H.G. Rees on July 12, 2006. Mr. Rees served with distinction on the Board of Trustees for nearly three decades. The Institute was strengthened by his wise counsel, his keen insight and his steady hand. We were personally enriched by his warmth and his generous spirit.
