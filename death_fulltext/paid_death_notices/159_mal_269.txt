        MOORE-George S. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of George Moore, Treasurer of the Board from 1958-1967, President of the Board from 1967-1974 and Chairman from 1974-1975. An Honorary Director at the time of his death, we recall his firm leadership of the Metropolitan Opera during a very difficult and challenging period in its history. His tenure provided a firm base from which today's successful company has grown. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Charon, and his family. Mrs. Gilbert W. Humphrey, Chairman Emeritus Bruce Crawford, Honorary Chairman James Kinnear, Chairman Paul Montone, President
