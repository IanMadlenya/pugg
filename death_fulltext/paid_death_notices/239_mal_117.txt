        SCHECK--Gary. We mourn the loss of our partner of 25 years and co-worker of United Sales. We extend our sincerest condolences to the Scheck family. We will always have Gary in our hearts.
        $(6$)SCHECK--Gerard. Beloved husband of Bonnie. Devoted father of Adam, Andrew, Todd, and father-in-law to Ali and Karen. Brother to Jules and the late Harvey Scheck. Gary will be missed by his family and friends who adored his larger than life personality and Joe Torre looks. He devoted much passion and innovation to his successful career at United Sales Concepts for 25 years. Whether a day at Yankee Stadium, or watching a tennis match in Florida, spending quality time with family and friends was what he cherished most. He took great pride in his involvement in the community and was deeply devoted to the Jewish faith. His time with us was too short, and he will be greatly missed, but never forgotten. We will always keep him close to our hearts. Love, Bonnie, Adam, Andrew, Todd, Karen, and Ali. Funeral services will be held on Sunday, December 10 at 12:30 at: Gutterman-Musicant Funeral Home, 402 Park St., Hackensack, NJ 07601.
