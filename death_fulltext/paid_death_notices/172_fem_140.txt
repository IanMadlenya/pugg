        WEINTRAUB-Sarah Regina, 101. Peacefully passed away May 15, 2001 in her sleep. Born in New York City in 1899, she celebrated living in three centuries with her family and many friends. After almost nine decades as a staunch New Yorker, Sarah moved to Palm Desert, CA, where she lived for twelve years before moving yet again, at 100 years of age, to Westwood, CA. Sarah survived her loving husband of 67 years, Max, as well as her sons Monroe and Edward. Once an educator, and never at a loss for words, she reached all with a loving & guiding hand. Passionate about food and decor, Sarah was possessed of a remarkable sense of humor. She is survived by her son, Dr. Lewis Weintraub of Brentwood, CA; her brother, Jerome Pickman of New York City; three grandchildren; five great grandchildren; and many nieces and nephews. In lieu of flowers the family requests donations to the Anti Defamation League (ADL). Memorial service to be held today at Mount Sinai Memorial Park, Los Angeles, CA. The absolute matriarch of the family, we will remember and love Sarah always. She is greatly missed.
