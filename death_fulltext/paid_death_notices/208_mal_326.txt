        FORRESTAL--Robert P. The Board of Directors, officers, and staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta are deeply saddened by the loss of Robert P. Forrestal, former president and chief executive officer. He died of cancer on May 26 at the age of 72. A native of New York City and graduate of St. John's University, he studied in France on a Fulbright Scholarship in 1953, beginning an interest in international affairs that he applied throughout his career. He later served as an officer in the U.S. Naval Intelligence, with tours of duty in Morocco, Italy, and Great Britain. Upon discharge, he earned a law degree from Georgetown, and soon joined the Federal Reserve System, where he spent most of his professional life. After six years at the Board of Governors in Washington, DC, in 1970 he joined the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta as general counsel. He later served as first vice president and chief operating officer before becoming president and CEO from 1983 to 1995. Mr. Forrestal was a member of the Fed's monetary policy making body, the FOMC, and led the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta during a period of rapid change in the banking industry and the economy. To deal with these challenges, he strengthened the Altanta Fed's research and supervisory functions while maintaining the Bank's operational efficiency in processing checks, cash, and other payments. He also increased understanding of international economics and finance, giving numerous speeches around the U.S. and in Latin America and Europe, often in French, Italian or Spanish. Throughout his career he was active in community service, and served on numerous boards, including those of various hospitals, universities, and other nonprofits. To his wife, Wilma Anderson Forrestal, his daughter, Renee Spoerer, and three grandsons, Robbie, Nicholas, and Thomas, we extend our condolences.
