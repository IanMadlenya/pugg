        REDFIELD - Walter. The Board of Directors, staff, members and participants of the Association for the Help of Retarded Children/New York City extend their deepest sympathy to Douglas and Susan Redfield upon the passing of their father, Walter Redfield. Walter has been a member of AHRC/NYC and a member of its Board of Directors for decades, during which time he provided leadership as its President, as well as serving on the NYSARC Board of Governors. Walter chaired and served on numerous Agency committees. He was particularly known as an advocate of AHRC's Guardianship Program and as a mentor to the families who participated in it. Walter was always an unwavering beacon and he will be missed by all who knew him. Genevieve O'Neil, President Michael Goldfarb, Executive Director, AHRC
