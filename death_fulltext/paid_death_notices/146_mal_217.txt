        JAFFE-Ralph. We extend heartfelt condolences to Trudy Jaffe on the passing of her beloved husband, Ralph. He was an extraordinary and humble man whose very being radiated kindness, dignity and modesty. A Founder of the medical center together with Trudy, his leadership and exceptional commitment to tzedakah played a vital role in providing world-class and compassionate medical care to the people of Israel, rooted in the spiritual and ethical precepts of Jewish tradition to which he devoted his life. May Trudy, his son Lawrence, his daughter Rochelle Greenberg, a devoted patron and outstanding friend to the medical center, and the entire family, having loving memories of this wonderful and caring man, and may they be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
