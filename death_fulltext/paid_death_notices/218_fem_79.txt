        FINBERG--Barbara D. The Stanford University community mourns the passing of Barbara D. Finberg, whose love for Stanford and contributions to university life knew no bounds. Her formal service as a philanthropist, trustee and member of countless advisory committees was matched by her informal role as a colleague and mentor to those who were fortunate enough to have her guidance and friendship. Her distinguished career as a public servant and unrelenting advocate for children and families will always be a great source of pride and a shining example for all whose lives she touched at her alma mater.
