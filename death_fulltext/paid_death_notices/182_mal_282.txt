        GEFFEN-Rabbi Samuel. The entire Abraham Joshua Heschel School community mourns the passing of our beloved founder Peter Geffen's revered father, Rabbi Samuel Geffen. Rabbi Geffen was an exceptionally talented man, who was a concert violinist and lawyer before becoming a Rabbi. He was the devoted spiritual leader for over 40 years of the Jewish Center of Forest Hills West. We send our heartfelt sympathy to his wife Ruth (Rosenfield), son Peter, daughter-in-law Susie Kessler and grandchildren Jonah, David and Nessa who will greatly miss this kind, gentle, caring soul. Shira Nadich Levin President, Board of Trustees Roanna Shorofsky, Director Abraham Joshua Heschel School
