        SCHWARTZ-Richard. We feel honored to have had you as our law partner for so many years and feel even more honored to have had you as a friend. You were a giving and generous man, always ready to offer a kind word and helping hand. You shouldered many responsibilities yet always managed to joke around and lift the spirits of those around you. You've enriched our lives beyond measure and will be sorely missed. Joan Levin and Joseph Milano
