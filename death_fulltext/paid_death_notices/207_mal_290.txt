        ROSEMAN--Mill. August 14, 1921-September 27, 2003. Son of Pearl and Mischa, died at home in Center Moriches, with his adoring wife at his side. Loving father of Paul, Jane, Robin and John (Hinchcliff). Doting grandfather of Kate, Abby, and Emily. Graduate CCNY; MA, NYU. Worked at PM newspaper with his good friend George Nelson. Served in the Army Air Corps in WWII. A lifelong ad man and marketing consultant, early on Mill worked for the American Jewish Committee and did publicity for Nathan's of Coney Island. He worked with James Beard and other notables in the food world. In the 1950's, Mill became a partner in The Lampert Agency. He had a long association with Strathmore Paper, and later in life was VP of Marketing at Impressions of Roslyn. He was a regular contributor to ''Communication Arts.'' Mill was a fine writer --precise, elegant language was his to command. He was an accomplished sculptor, working in various media. He loved music & art, across a heroically eclectic spectrum, but what truly defined Mill was his passionate, immutable belief that everyone was entitled to social justice, to be able to work with dignity at a fair wage, and to be able to live their lives unburdened by oppression and fear. Mill marched for civil rights and for the rights of women to choose their reproductive destinies. He found war and aggression and imperialism abhorrent. He was a wonderful husband, and is sorely missed by those who loved him. Linda S. Miller-Roseman
