        REISS--Alfred B. Loving husband of Hilda J. Reiss and father of Bart Reiss, passed away yesterday. In an American sense, he was a great man. A self-reliant man-who started with nothing-who put himself through college at night, while working a day job and helping financially with his parents. My father had an exceptional marriage and relationship with my mother for 57 years; he considered himself to be a very lucky man. He worked hard, became very, very successful, but never forgot his family. I, his son, have the utmost respect for him. Like any human being, he wasn't perfect, but he was gentle, and good, and had a pure nature. He was sometimes misunderstood, because he wasn't one who was always aware of his own emotions. However, he was simple: in the best of terms. He didn't mean anyone any harm; he didn't speak unkindly of others. I miss him greatly.
