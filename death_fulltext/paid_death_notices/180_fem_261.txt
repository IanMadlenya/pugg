        CLINESMITH-Jeannette. Our beloved mother passed into eternity on January 24, 2002. An artist and musician, she was a being of tremendous courage, conviction and resilience. As a single parent who endured the loss of her first born child, Gillian, she is survived by two sons, Khahim and Malik, a daughter, Raven, as well as two beautiful grandchildren, Ayanna and Walker. She will be greatly missed, though her fiery spirit will continue to radiate in the lives of those who love her.
