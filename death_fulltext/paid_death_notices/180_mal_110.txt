        KIMMEL-Edward A. The owners, officers and employees of the Charles H. Greenthal Group mourn the passing of Edward A. Kimmel. Edward and his brothers, after WWII, became one of New York's premiere real estate families. He was more than just a client of our office. For nearly 50 years he was both friend and mentor to Charles Greenthal and the West family. Above all, he was a living example of those most rare of business qualities, they being fairness and loyalty. He was there for us in good and bad times. Our deepest condolences to his family.
