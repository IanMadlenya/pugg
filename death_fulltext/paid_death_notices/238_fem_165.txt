        COMDEN--Betty. The Steinhardt School at New York University mourns the death of our beloved alumna Betty Comden. A mentor to our musical theater students and a good friend of our school, Betty's music and movies were an inspiration to us all. We gave her a classic education in ''Shakespeare, Shaw, and Sheridan,'' and she gave us a lifetime of great works. We will miss her. Mary Brabeck, Dean, NYU Steinhardt
