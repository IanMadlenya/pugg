        DILLON--Martin. A uniquely bright light in our lives went out when our dear friend & colleague, Martin Dillon, passed away suddenly. We mourn his passing with tears, giggles & endless gratitude. Martin was a superb musician, a wonderful tenor, an adored teacher, & above all, an irrepressibly sweet, and loving friend. He left the earth feeling great about his life, & those luminous sparks of happiness he created will surround us forever. Love. Arthur J. Levy, Charlotte Surkin, Joseph Schiavo
