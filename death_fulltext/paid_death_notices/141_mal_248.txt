        DALY-John F., M.D. The faculty & staff of NYU School of Medicine mourn the loss of our esteemed colleague and friend, Dr. John F. Daly. A native of New Jersey, Dr. Daly received his A.B. Degree from Fordham University in 1932 and his M.D. Degree in 1937 from Long Island College of Medicine. He served his internship at Holy Name Hospital in Teaneck, NJ. From 1942 to 1946 he served in the U.S. Army Air Force where he attained the rank of Major. Dr. Daly came to NYU School of Medicine in 1946, and had a long and distinguished career as Professor and Chairman of the Department of Otolaryngology from 1949-1980. He was also Director of Otolaryngology at Bellevue Hospital Center. He was one of the founders of the field of modern Head and Neck Surgery and an outstanding physician-educator who was devoted to his patients and students. An active member of many professional societies, he served as President of the American Society for Head and Neck Surgery, The American Academy of Ophthalmology, and Otolaryngology and was Chairman of the American Medical Association's Section Council on Otolaryngology. Dr. Daly was the recipient of numerous honors and awards. In addition, he was consultant to many hospitals in the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut metropolitan area. To his long-time wife, Annette O'Mealia Daly and daughter, Sharon Ann Butler, and grandchildren, we extend our heartfelt sympathy. Noel L. Cohen, M.D., Chairman Dept of Otolaryngology Vice Dean for Clinical Affairs Robert M. Glickman, M.D., Dean NYU School of Medicine
