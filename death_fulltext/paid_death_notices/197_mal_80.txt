        ROSENBAUM--Milton, M.D. On May 18, 2003 at age 92. The Scheuer, Sofaer and Ungerleider families extend their deepest sympathies to his children, Michael (MajBritt) Rosenbaum, Elizabeth (Raphael) Magnes, Mary (Rob) Dwan, his sister Bernice, his 11 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. Milt, who founded the psychiatric departments at the Albert Einstein Medical School and at Hebrew University, was a great friend. We will all miss his insight, his good humor, and his humanity. >>AD#
