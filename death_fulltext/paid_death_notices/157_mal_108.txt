        ELVIRA-Pablo. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the untimely death of Pablo Elvira. He sang more than 100 performances with our company between 1978 and 1990, including his debut role, Tonio in ''Pagliacci,'' as well as Figaro in ''Il Barbiere di Siviglia,'' Enrico in ''Lucia di Lammermoor,'' and Marcello in ''La Boheme.'' We extend our sincerest sympathies to his family. Joseph Volpe, General Manager James Levine, Artistic Director
