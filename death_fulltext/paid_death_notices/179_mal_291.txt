        McSHERRY-Charles K., M.D. NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and Weill Cornell Medical College deeply mourn the passing of Dr. Charles K. McSherry, Clinical Professor of Surgery Emeritus and Attending Surgeon. A graduate of Cornell University Medical College, who completed his training in surgery at The New York Hospital, he was nationally renowned for his research into cancer of the colon and gallstone formation. He worked with Dr. Frank Glenn in creating a biliary disease registry and led the way in introducing laparoscopic surgery for gallstones. We extend our condolences to his family. John M. Daly, M.D. Chairman, Dept. of Surgery, New York Weill Cornell Medical Center
