        SCHACTER -- Ralph. You were my business partner for over 45 years. You left the people of Greenwich a lasting legacy of good, environmentally-friendly building and site design. You set the standard for integrity in a profession not always known for that. In our first apartment endeavor, you discovered that the engineer had inadvertently under-designed some of the structure of the first building. At our great expense, you corrected the error and invited the building inspector to approve the correction. Ted Anderson, the building inspector, said it was the first and only time a builder had done that in all his years in the business. I will miss you sorely, Ralph. Seymour Schwartz
