        BAILEY--Helen Phelps. On the 5th anniversary of her death, she is remembered with affection and admiration by friends, family, colleagues and students. Professor of French Language and Literature for 43 years and Dean of Studies for 15 years at Barnard College, she was a graduate of Barnard and earned a Ph.D. from Columbia University. She studied also at McGill University and at the Sorbonne. She authored a book, ''Hamlet in France from Voltaire to Laforgue,'' and did the first known translation from French of a play by St. Therese of Lisieux. The French Government awarded her the Palmes Academiques for her fostering of French culture and arts. Until shortly before her death at age 90, she was a lector and choir member at her church, St. John's of Leonia, NJ. She encountered everyone on an equal footing, with a rare combination of kindness and objectivity that made her a dear and valued friend.
