        LEVIN-Alfred C., Doctor of Obstetrics and Gynecology, age 75, of Palm Beach Gardens, FL, on November 17, 1999, after a long illness. A close friend of 73 years. We will deeply miss his love of life and wonderful sense of humor. Our profoundest sympathy to his wife Corinne and other family members. Contributions in his memory to the Helen and Harry Gray Cancer Institute at Good Samaritan Medical Center, West Palm Beach, FL, would be appreciated by the family. Arnold and Beverly Franco
