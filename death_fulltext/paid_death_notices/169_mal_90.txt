        HERZMAN-Stanley. The Trustees and staff of the Educational Alliance note with profound sadness the passing of Stanley Herzman, our longtime Trustee and friend. Stanley joined the Alliance's Board of Trustees on February 20, 1967, and founded and supported for more than A decade the popular and well attended Gladys Herzman Lecture Series. His philanthropy continued and extended to the Sol Goldman Y, which was reopened by the Alliance in 1996. During this past year, Stanley unselfishly pledged to support a diverse range of programs and services in the Alliance's Elder Care Division. Our senior group work services will be named The Stanley Herzman Center for Elder Care Services, as a tribute to his magnanimous support. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his daughter, Carol Fishman, and his extended family.
