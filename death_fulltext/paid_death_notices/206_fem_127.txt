        KURSCH--Victoria Offerman. The Board of Directors, Staff and members of the YM & YWHA of Washington Heights and Inwood express profound sorrow upon the passing of Victoria Offerman Kursch, mother of our esteemed Honorary President and Director, Stephen Offerman and beloved wife of Sol Kursch. Vicki's first husband, the late Sidney Offerman was a former President, and founder of this Y. As a mother, grandmother and greatgrandmother, she was a model woman of valor and caring heart who supported both her husband's and son's efforts in their role at the Y. Our deepest sympathies to her large and loving family. Jeffrey M. Loewy, President Martin G. Englisher, Exec VP
