        PORTER-Keith Roberts. We mourn the death of Keith Porter, our longtime friend and mentor, on May 2, 1997, in Bryn Mawr, PA. He was an extraordinary scientist known for his brilliant microscopy and keen insight into the structure and function of cells. He was a pioneer in tissue culture and a founder of the field of cell biology. During all his years, successively as Professor or Chairman at Rockefeller, Harvard, Boulder, Maryland and Pennsylvania, he was at his best with students and young people, many of whom, like us, he guided in their careers. He wore his many honors, including the Lasker Award and the National Medal of Science, lightly. We will miss him for his inspiration, his encouragement, his sharp wit and good humor. We send our heartfelt condolences to his niece, Mrs. Mary Holman of Nova Scotia, Canada, and his nephew, Mr. Keith M. Pineo of Prince Edward Island, Canada. Mary Bonneville, Blair Bowers, Clara Franzini-Armstrong, Birgit Hegner Satir, Lee D. Peachey and Peter Satir
