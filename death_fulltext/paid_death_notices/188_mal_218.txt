        GREENBERG-J.J. On behalf of The Wexner Foundation and the Fellows and Alumni of the Wexner Graduate and Israel Fellowship programs, we mourn the untimely death of JJ Greenberg, son of our dear friends and colleagues, Rabbi Yitz and Blu Greenberg. JJ's passionate commitment to Jewish life and love of Israel have set an extraordinary standard for all leaders. His name will ever inspire us. To the entire Greenberg family, we offer our deepest sympathy and support. Leslie and Abigail Wexner
