        ROCKOFF--Frances Schletter, 93, of Passaic, NJ. Passed away peacefully December 5. Beloved wife of the late Meyer. Loving mother to Doris and Elaine. Cherished grandmother of seven grandchildren and five greatgrandchildren. If you could dream up a grandmother, multiply it by a million, that's what she is to her devoted granddaughter Ellen. As always, she is my sun in the morning & my moon at night.
