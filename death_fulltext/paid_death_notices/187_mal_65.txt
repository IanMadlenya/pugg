        BIDERMAN-George. The Officers and Directors of the Fire Island Association record, with sorrow, the passing of George Biderman, a former president of the association, on July 20. For 25 years, George Biderman was a leader, first, in the creation of the Fire Island National Seashore and, second, in its critical formative years, when the National Park Service and the residents of Fire Island's 17 communities worked together to devise ground rules under which this unique unit of the National Park System would be managed. The association, the residents and millions of visitors to Fire Island are greatly in his debt.
