        MILLIKEN--John F. The Board of Directors, volunteers, and staff of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society express deep sorrow on the passing of John F. Milliken, who died August 6 at the age of 84. Mr. Milliken's 50 years of service with the National MS Society began with the Chicago Chapter, where he served on its Board of Trustees from 1954 to 1980. In 1980 he became a Trustee of the Maine Chapter. He was elected to the Society's National Board of Directors in 1973, and in 1996 was named an Honorary Life Director. Mr. Milliken had a long career as an insurance executive, and was Vice President of Alexander & Alexander, Inc. in Chicago. He is survived by his wife; their children, Amelia Rowell, Alida Zimmerman, John Jr, MD, Mark and Scott; 14 grandchildren; and one greatgrandchild. Mr. Milliken's commitment and dedication to the MS cause will be truly missed, and we extend our sincere sympathy to his entire family. Donations may be made in his memory to the National MS Society.
