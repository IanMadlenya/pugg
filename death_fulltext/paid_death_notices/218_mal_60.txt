        BEHAR -- Howard Michael. Died on Friday, March 4, 2005, at age 62. A lifetime New Yorker, Mr. Behar was a graduate of Brooklyn College. His love of children and education led him to a 34 year career as a teacher. First in Public School 253 in Brooklyn, and later in Intermediate School 72 on Staten Island, until his retirement in 2000. Known for his quick wit and droll sense of humor, Mr. Behar will be terribly missed by his numerous close friends and loving family. He is survived by his wife of 37 years, Karen, his children Elisabeth (Charles) and Scott, his grandchildren Mia and Noah, and sister Sheila.
