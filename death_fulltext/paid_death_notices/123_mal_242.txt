        BEYDA-Joseph. Once in a generation, the Almighty gives us a gift and puts on this earth a person whose purpose is to lead, and make a difference. In his 57 short years, Joseph has touched thousands of souls from children to senior citizens. His humanity, his kindness, and his caring inspires us all. His impact on our community and on the lives of those he touched will last forever. We miss you, Joseph, but you will never be gone. Our heartfelt condolences to his wife Barbara, his daughter Shirley, sons David and Jeffrey, his mother Shirley and the whole family. May he continue to look after us all from above.
