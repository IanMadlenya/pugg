        DANA-Bess. The Board and staff of Partnership for Caring mourn the passing of Bess Dana. A longtime member of the Board of Directors of Choice In Dying, one of our predecessor organizations, Mrs. Dana worked tirelessly to improve the care of the terminally ill and to gain recognition for their rights to determine the course of their own medical care. Her spirit and voice will be deeply missed.
