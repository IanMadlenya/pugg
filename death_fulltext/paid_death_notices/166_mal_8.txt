        TEDLOW-Samuel L. The Metropolitan Opera mourns with profound sadness the loss of our very dear friend, Samuel L. Tedlow, a member of the board for more than 24 years, who served as a managing director for 10 years and was an honorary director at the time of his death. A courtly, kind and gentle man, he gave devoted service to The Metropolitan Opera as a member of the finance committee and chairman of the audit and nominating committees during important years of transition for our company. Together with his beloved wife Lillian, Ted set a leadership example for other good friends of the Met through his quiet generosity to our activities for nearly four decades. As patrons of the Met since the company moved to the new Opera House at Lincoln Center in 1966, Ted and Lillian were founding members of the Golden Horseshoe Program and the Encore Society and participated in creating our first endowment campaign and the Pooled Income Fund, the Silver Anniversay Fund, and the new campaign to increase our endowment fund. We recall with deep affection Ted and Lillian's enjoyment of opera at the Met. Together they took special pleasure in underwriting two new productions, ''Les Contes D'Hoffmann'' in 1973 and ''Rigoletto'' in 1977, as well as helping to underwrite nine other productions, even during recent years when ill health prevented them from attending Met performances. We will miss Ted's wise counsel and his abiding support of our company as well as his personal friendships with many of us on the board and in Met management. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Lillian, his sons, Richard and David, his daughter, Roberta Rood, and his family. Mrs. Gilbert W. Humphrey, Chairman Emeritus Bruce Crawford, Honorary Chairman James w. Kinnear, Chairman Paul M. Montrone, President
