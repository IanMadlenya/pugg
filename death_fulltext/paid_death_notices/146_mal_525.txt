        GOULD-Milton S. Usually not more than once in a lifetime does one come upon a person who indelibly marks all those with whom he comes in contact. Milton S. Gould was one such person-a great lawyer, a great mentor, a great boss and a great man with a lion's heart. He is now reunited in Heaven with another such person, Bill Shea. In behalf of all of the twice blessed former partners, associates and support staff of Shea and Gould, heartfelt condolences are extended to his children, Jud, Jonathan, and Patricia, and his grandchildren. Vincent F. Pitta, Esquire
