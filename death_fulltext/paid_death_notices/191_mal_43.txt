        PAPPER-Emanuel M., M.D. The boards, faculty, students and staff of Columbia University Health Sciences Division and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital mourn the loss of our esteemed friend and colleague, Dr. Emanuel Papper. In 1949, Dr. Papper was appointed chairman of Columbia University's Department of Anesthesiology, the youngest department chairman in the school's history. The department became widely recognized for the excellence of its research and training under his leadership-38 of Dr. Papper's students at Columbia went on to become chairmen of departments of anesthesiology at universities in the U.S. and abroad. His achievements have been honored by the establishment of both a lectureship and a professorship in his name at Columbia. In 1969, Dr. Papper became dean of the University of Miami School of Medicine, where he served for more than 10 years. In 1989, Dr. Papper became a founding member of the Columbia Presbyterian Health Sciences Advisory Council and actively participated in its meetings. He was a most warm and unique individual-an outstanding, gentle man who was loved by all. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Patricia, and his family and friends. He will be greatly missed. Gerald D. Fischbach, M.D. Executive Vice President for Health and Biomedical Sciences and Dean of the Faculty of Medicine Columbia University Herbert Pardes, M.D. President and CEO NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital Margaret Wood, M.D. Emanuel M.
