She enriched our lives with her aesthetic sensibility, her gourmet cooking, her gardening and her thoughtfully selected gifts. At her express direction, the funeral is private. The family will observe Shiva, beginning Saturday evening, in the house she graced for 46 years. Her favorite charity was Camp Ramah, affiliated with The Jewish Theological Seminary of America.
