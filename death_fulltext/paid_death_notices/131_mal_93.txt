        FLACKS-Paul. The officers and members of the Zionist Organization of America mourn the passing of its former Executive Vice President who dedicated a lifetime to the cause of Israel and Zionism. His notable accomplishments on behalf of Israel and the Jewish people will be an inspiration to future generations. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his beloved widow Shirley and to the members of his family. May they find comfort among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Morton A. Klein National President
