        BERMAN-Blanche. The Board of Directors and staff of UJA-Federation of New York note with sadness the passing of Blanche Berman. Blanche was the beloved mother of Dr. Kenneth Berman, a cherished friend, leader, major suporter of our mission, and chair of our Long Island South Shore Campaign. We extend our deepest sympathies to Kenny and his wife, Ronni, and their children, and to Kenny's sister, Froma Hisenberg, and Blanche's grandchildren and great-grandchildren. May her memory be a blessing. James S. Tisch, President Larry Zicklin, Board Chair & President-Elect Arthur M. Katz, LI Cabinet Chair John S. Ruskay, Exec VP & CEO Simon S. Kaminetsky, LI Director
