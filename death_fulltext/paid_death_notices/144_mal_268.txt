        MANOCHERIAN-Eskandar. It is with great sorrow that the Board of Directors and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Eskandar Manocherian, a prominent businessman and a dedicated friend to the Jewish community. Our deepest sympathies go to: his children Jeffrey and Cynthia, longtime supporters of UJA-Federation, Dr. Darel M. and Carlos Benaim, and Donald and Zaza; his brothers, Amir, Fraydun, and Touran; his sister, Lori; his many grandchildren; his cherished friend, Barbara Levey; and to the entire family. May you be consoled among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair James S.Tisch, President Andrew J. Singer, Chair, Real Estate Division Stephen D. Solender, Exec V.P.
