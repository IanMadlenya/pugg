        LEE-James A. The American Civil Liberties Union and The New York Civil Liberties Union mourn the sudden passing of James A. Lee, who as a Board member, donor and valuable member of the Union's budget and investment committees, was, for nearly four decades, one of the ACLU's most devoted supporters. His passionate concern for access to justice, especially for those with relatively few resources to brave the legal system, will leave a lasting imprint on the ACLU's programs in this area. We will miss him, but we will not forget him. Ira Glasser, Exec Dir, American Civil Liberties Union
