        KLEIN-Mary A. Loving sister, mother and doting grandmother, died on August 8th at Roosevelt Hospital at 73. A long time resident of Manhattan's upper West side, Mary instilled in her family a passion for life. Born in Michigan to Methodist minister William and Myrtle Morford, Mary was an avid traveler and adventurer who loved the theatre, fine arts, politics and enjoyed gardening. One of the first women to receive her pilot's license, Mary's strong and independent nature led her to travel the far corners of the world, a career in network programming at CBS Television and eventually into real estate, where she owned and managed properties and European style bed and breakfasts on Manhattan's upper West side. A generous woman with a heart of gold, Mary Klein now rests in peace with her son Christopher who died tragically in 1992, and her sister Laura who passed earlier this year. Survived by her sons Michael and Joshua, daughters in law Khairah and Mary, grandchildren Christopher, Adia and Emma, and her sister Lillian and brother in law Don, the can-do spirit and sense of adventure that Mary shared with all of us will be greatly missed. A memorial service was held on Friday, August 9th at The Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew United Methodist Church in Manhattan.
