        KATZ-Phyllis. Farewell to our beautiful Phyllis. We will miss her love and friendship and will cherish forever the good times the four of us shared. We were a great team. A Renaisance woman, with profound intellect, her spirit will live on through her music and art. She fought the battle of her life the way she lived it: with courage, grace and wit. Our hearts go out to Abe and their precious family. Rest in peace, dearest friend. Doris and Norman Tipograph
