        KOONS--Tilghman B. 79, on July 7, 2005, at his home in East Hampton. Son of Margaret O'Hara and Lucius Koons. Beloved and admired by his friends, ''Skip'' Koons had a wide-ranging career in the military, government and banking. Born in Plainfield, NJ, he received his B.A. from Princeton, with honors, at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs in 1946. From 1946 to 1949 he was in the U.S. Navy, learning Russian at the Language School in Boulder, CO, serving in Washington with Secretary James Forrestal and in China for two and a half years, working with Russian emigre communities in Shanghai, Peking and Manchuria. After receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, in 1952 he earned a Ph.D., with highest honors, from the University of Paris (Sorbonne). His thesis traced the political ideas and activities of the Russian emigres from the Russian Revolution to the outbreak of World War II. From 1953 to 1957 he served in the Executive Office of the President, as an adviser to General Robert Cutler, President Eisenhower's Special Assistant for National Security. Upon leaving the government, he joined the First National Bank of Boston and, in 1962, the Chase Manhattan Bank where, as Vice President, he was concerned with strategic planning of the bank's overseas expansion in Latin America, the Far East and Canada. In addition to his professional activities, Skip was learned in history and the arts, and assembled a notable collection of marine water colors and prints from the 18th and 19th centuries. His wisdom, warmth and generosity will be sorely missed by his many friends in this country and in Europe. A Memorial Service will be announced.
