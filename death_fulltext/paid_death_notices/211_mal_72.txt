        PAPALEO -- Joseph. Sarah Lawrence College mourns the death of Joseph Papaleo, alumnus of the College and faculty member from 1960 to 1992. Joe was a prolific writer of memorable, honest fiction, and a teacher of wisdom, generosity and humor. He was a central figure in the development of the Sarah Lawrence writing program, and he was mentor and friend to generations of students. His talent as writer and teacher, his innate decency and his wit will be long remembered and cherished. Sarah Lawrence College extends our sympathy and love to Joe's wife, Tonie, and to the Papaleo family. Michele Tolela Myers, President Barbara Kaplan, Dean of the College
