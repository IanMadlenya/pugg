        WEST--Ormand J., Jr. (6/21/36-9/20/06) A long-time television director (30 years with WCBS-TV News in NYC), Orm ''faded to black'' on September 20, 2006. A graduate of Manchester, CT High School (''Best-Natured, Class of '54'') and the U. of Miami (FL) School of Communications (Iron Arrow member), Orm was known for his upbeat spirit, his irreverent sense of humor, his quick wit, his infectious laugh, his sense of adventure, his gentle strength, and his deep kindness and respect toward others. He was truly an honorable man. He had an all-consuming interest in every news story and every NY Yankee game until the very end. All those Orman touched--as a devoted and loving husband, father, son, brother, colleague, and friend--are richer for having known him. He will be greatly missed, but his incredible zest for life will live on in all of us. Survived by wife Patricia, daughter Kristin and her husband Guillermo Gonzalez, sister Carol and her husband Ramon Perez, niece Kimberly and her husband Troy Smith, and nephew David. Predeceased by son Andrew.
