        BARNETT-Matilda. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) deeply mourn the loss of Matilda Barnett of Los Angeles, CA, a generous and devoted ATS supporter. In the memory of her late husband, Gabriel, and her late son, Brian Morris, Mrs. Barnett established the Brian Morris Building-Matilda and Gabriel Barnett Student Dormitory at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology. In doing so, Mrs. Barnett attained the rank of Technion Guardian, representing the highest level of commitment to the Technion. Mrs. Barnett's support of the ATS was a family tradition. Her brother, the late Sir Arthur Gilbert, also was a Technion Guardian. Mrs. Barnett is survived by her nephew, Colin Gilbert, and her niece, Jacqueline Brumer. Her kindness and generosity will be missed by those who knew her. American Society for TechnionIsrael Institute of Technology Evelyn Berger, President Lawrence S.
