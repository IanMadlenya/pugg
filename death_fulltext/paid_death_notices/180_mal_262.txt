        RITTER-Chaskele, Cantor. Boys Town Jerusalem mourns with profound sorrow the passing of a most cherished member of its extended family. Chaskele was not only admired as one of the greatest cantors of his century, but was equally respected for his commitment to Am Yisrael and Eretz Yisrael, giving selflessly of his talents and means to benefit countless noble causes. Heartfelt condolences to his loving and devoted son, Dr. Samuel (Dr. Rebecca) Ritter, who brought him so much nachas in life. Michael Scharf, President Raphael Benaroya, Chairman Josh Weston, Honorary Chairman Rabbi Ronald L. Gray, Exec. V.P.
