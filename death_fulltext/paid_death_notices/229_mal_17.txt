        BEHLER--John L. The Board of Trustees and Staff of the Wildlife Conservation Society are profoundly saddened by the death of our esteemed colleague, John L. Behler. As Curator of Herpetology, Behler began his WCS career in 1970 in the Reptile Department and as an intern. John's knowledge and love of wildlife included working with WCS field staff on related projects in Madagascar and Asia and is known and appreciated worldwide. His work exemplified the long history of WCS setting standards for others to follow. He assumed a leadership role among his peers in groundbreaking captive breeding programs for endangered crocodilians, tortoises and freshwater turtles and also focused on the ecology and behavior of reptilians. John's wit, charm and dedication allowed him to share his life's work with many. Among his numerous affiliations, John was a founding member of the American Zoo and Aquarium's Crocodilian Advisory Group and worked closely with the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation's Endangered Species Unit. Likewise, Behler served his community on the Sommers Conservation Board and Muscoot Farm Nature Center in Westchester County Park. Behler authored more than 40 popular scientific articles, five guidebooks highlighting reptilians and amphibians and coauthored a book, ''Frogs-A Chorus of Colors'' with his wife, Deborah Behler. We're all saddened by the loss of our friend, a great scientist and conservationist. Our heartfelt sympathies go to John's wife, Debbie; mother, Mildred; sister, Judy Howells; John's children, Cindy Sibilia, and David Behler and his five grandchildren. David T. Schiff, Chairman Board of Trustees Steven E. Sanderson, President and CEO
