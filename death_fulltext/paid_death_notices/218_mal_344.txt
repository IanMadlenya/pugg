        GALASSO--Ralph J. The partners, associates and staff of Pavia & Harcourt LLP mourn the untimely loss of our dear friend and colleague, Ralph J. Galasso. Ralph was the head of our real estate practice group and a trusted advisor and counselor, in the fullest sense of those words, to innumerable friends and clients. Ralph enriched our lives with his charm, wit, enthusiasm and decency. He made us look forward to coming to work each day and always challenged us to be better lawyers and better people. His thoughtfulness and care of those in need of help was legendary. Ralph's courage and grace at all times--especially this past year--have been an inspiration and a lesson for us all. Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with his wife, Jane, and his children, Ali and Chris. He will be deeply mourned and greatly missed.
        GALASSO--Ralph J. We are deeply saddened. We have lost an extraordinary, loving friend. We will miss his wisdom, wit, strength and courage. To Jane, Ali and Chris, our thoughts and prayers are with you. Ronny and Stephanie Kreismann
