        LOWITT-Julian. The Board of Directors and staff of Fedcap Rehabilitation Services Inc. mourn the death of Executive Director Emeritus and Boardmember, Julian Lowitt. Julian dedicated his career to Fedcap, and the cause of independence and opportunity for people with disabilities through employment. He was a trailblazer in the field of vocational rehabilitation, nationally known and deeply loved. Julian came to Fedcap in 1960, and served as its Executive Director from 1991-94. After retirement, he became a vital member of our Board of Directors, serving as chair of the Fedcap Business Advisory Council. His guidance, dedication and humor will be greatly missed. His legacy will endure with each new business and government partnership that opens the door for people with disabilities to achieve economic independence. Our sincere condolences to his wife Bertha, daughter Sue, son-in-law Tom, and grandson Jon.
