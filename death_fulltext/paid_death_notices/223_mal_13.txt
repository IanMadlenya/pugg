        GUSBERG--Saul B., M.D. It is with profound sorrow that The Mount Sinai Alumni mourn the passing of our esteemed friend and colleague. Professor Emeritus of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Chairman of the Dept. from 1962-1980, Dr. Gusberg distinguished himself as an outstanding teacher, clinician, mentor and role model to the generations of students and physicians he trained. He provided superb care to his patients, wise counsel to his students and colleagues and was an inspiration to all who knew him. In 1990, the Mount Sinai Alumni presented its most coveted award, the Jacobi Medallion to Dr. Gusberg in acknowledgement of his many contributions as a physician, researcher and teacher and the great distinction he brought to Mount Sinai. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his entire family. Barry Stimmel, MD, Pres. Elliot Rayfield, MD, V.P. Steven Itzkowitz, MD, Sec'y Martin Goldstein, MD, Treas.
