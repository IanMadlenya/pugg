        GOFF--BethTwiggar, died Sunday in her home after a long illness, five days before her 93rd birthday. Perhaps the best description of Beth is in her book Understanding Backwards: ''A post-flapper, BA and spontaneous feminist, Beth went out into Depression-USA with a lot of living to do. Over the years, she married, mothered, marched, worked, wrote. She did freelance pieces for the old Herald Tribune. She turned out a thousand short stories and published a few, including two in the New Yorker. Her read-aloud book for little children of divorcing parents, Where is Daddy? (Beacon Press, 1969) was the first of its kind and in print for twentyeight years. If, as is said, an unexamined life is a wasted life, Beth is not wastrel. All her fifty-seven diaries have been acquired by the Schlesinger Library (Radcliffe College) on the History of Women in America.'' She leaves her sons: Daniel Gartrell, of Bemidji, MN and Stephen Gartrell, of Natick, MA. A memorial will be held in her home in West Nyack, from 2 to 4pm on Saturday, August 12. Phone 845-658-0478 for directions. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the United Hospice of Rockland, 11 Stokum Lane, New City, NY 10956.
