        SZULWACH--John. The Horace Mann School deeply mourns the passing of John Szulwach, our former beloved colleague and long time History teacher/administrator at HM's Lower Division for over 25 years. John's optimism, his commitment to the annual Williamsburg trip for sixth graders and his pragmatic leadership and strength of character made him an invaluable member of the Horace Mann Community. John's unwavering loyalty and support of Horace Mann and especially the Lower Division is acknowledged by everyone. His sharp wit and sense of humor will be greatly missed. We extend our heart-felt condolences to his wife Ann and to all his friends and colleagues. Dr. Thomas M. Kelly Head of School Steven M. Friedman '72 Chair, Board of Trustees
