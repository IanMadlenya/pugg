        VANDERBILT-Helen C. It is with the deepest sadness that Housing & Services, Inc. (HSI) bids farewell to one of its founding Board members, Helen C. Vanderbilt. Helen will be remembered always in the hearts and minds of the thousands she touched for helping the least able in our society to help themselves, for her indomitable strength and for her courage. She believed in the power of the human spirit-her inspirational example will be a beacon for us for many years. The Board and Staff of Housing & Services, Inc.
