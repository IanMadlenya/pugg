        HANDLEY-Walter. Died peacefully at home on May 31. Born in Vienna in 1904, he married Margaret Loewe in 1934 and ran both families' businesses. In 1938 he started a new life in England but came to New York as the war drew closer. In 1945 he founded Handcraft Inc. where, as a well respected designer and businessman, he was considered an asset to the menswear industry, even by his competitors. At 75, he developed a cashmere scarf division for Amicale Inc. Working until age 95, he remained a friend and mentor to his colleagues. Mr. Handley personified old-world charm and elegance and was an optimist who lived life to the fullest. He and Gretl traveled extensively. He was a remarkable man who will be missed by all who knew him; the beloved husband of Gretl, the adored father of Joan, grandfather of Michael and Daniel and father-in-law to Steven. A private funeral was held. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to VNS Hospice.
