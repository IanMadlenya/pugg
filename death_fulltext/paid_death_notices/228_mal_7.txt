        PARKINSON--John III. The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art mourn the passing of its great Trustee John Parkinson. John, who enjoyed a long and successful career as a banker, joined the MoMA Board of Trustees in 1976. For almost thirty years John served brilliantly in varying capacities as the Museum's Treasurer, Chairman of the Finance Committee, Chairman of the Pension Committee, Chairman of the Committee on Photography, and served as a member on many other trustee committees including the Expansion, Executive, Personnel, House, Investment, and Nominating committees. Since 1966 John was a member of the Museum's International Council and served as its Treasurer from 1973 to 1978. From 1970 onward, his generosity enabled the acquisition of scores of important photographs for the collection. John's relationship to the Museum reached back to its creation, as his mother, Elizabeth Bliss Parkinson Cobb, also a Trustee, was the niece of Lillie P. Bliss, one of the Museum's original founders. The Trustees and staff are profoundly grateful for John's extraordinary contribution to the life of the Museum and will remember him with affection and high regard as a great leader, a true gentleman, and a stalwart defender of the Museum's ideals. We will miss him deeply and extend our sympathies to his wife Charlotte, their children Elizabeth, John and Allston and all members of the Parkinson family.
