        MITCHELL-Sondra. The law firm of Stout and Thomas mourns the loss of its distinguished secretary, administrator and friend who provided more than 25 years of loyal service with distinction, elegance and grace. All who knew her were touched by her charm and warmth. Our sympathy is extended to her loving husband Julian, daughter Leslie, grandchildren Erica, Jessica, Wayne and extended family.
