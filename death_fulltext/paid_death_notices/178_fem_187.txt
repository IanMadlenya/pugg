        ELYACHAR-Anna Tulin. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) are deeply saddened by the loss of Anna Tulin Elyachar, an ardent supporter of the ATS, the Technion and Israel for more than half a century. Mrs. Elyachar became a devoted Zionist and ATS supporter along with her first husband, the late Abraham Tulin, in the early years of the State of Israel. A Life Trustee of the Women's Division since 1992, Mrs. Elyachar served as vice president of the ATS, was on the Technion International Board of Governors and received an Honorary Fellowship from the Technion. Her second husband, Col. J.R. Elyachar, a founder and past president of the ATS, established the Elyachar Central Library. As Technion Guardians, the couple demonstrated their devotion to the Technion through numerous additional gifts, including the Elyachar Library Fund. After Col. Elyachar's passing, Mrs. Elyachar established a state-of-the-art information center in the library. Intelligent, modest and an inspiring speaker, Mrs. Elyachar will be sorely missed. We extend our heartfelt condolences to her stepdaughter Ruth (Elyachar) Turner and the entire Elyachar and Tulin families.
