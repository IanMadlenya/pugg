        UNGERLEIDER-Peter. The Officers and Board of American Friends of the Hebrew University mourn with great sadness the passing of our friend and benefactor Peter Ungerleider, whose family has supported the Hebrew University for many years. Their generous donations, made through the Dorot Foundation, the family's charitable trust, have suppported a wide range of scholarly and cultural projects at the University, including the Jewish National and University Library, the Harry S. Truman Research Institute for the Advancement of Peace and the Rothberg School for Overseas Students. Peter's contributions have allowed many students and scholars to explore, understand and preserve the religious and cultural heritage of the Jewish people in Israel. We want to express our heartfelt sympathies to his entire family. Keith L. Sachs, President Lawrence Newman, Chairman of the Board Adam B. Kahan, Executive Vice President
