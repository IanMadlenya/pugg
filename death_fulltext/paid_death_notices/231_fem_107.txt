        MOHACSY--Ildiko. The William Alanson White community mourns the loss of Dr. Ildiko Mohacsy, a revered and beloved colleague who distinguished herself through numerous writing and lectures concerning her work with children and her deep understanding and passion for the arts. She combined a gracious and elegant presence with a certain steeliness of mind forged in times of war and dislocation. In parting we feel deeply grateful to her voice and spirit. She will be sorely missed. Joerg Bose, M.D., Director White Institute Gilead Nachmani, Ph.D., President White Society
