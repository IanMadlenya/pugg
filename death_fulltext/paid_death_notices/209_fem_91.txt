        BRESLIN -- Rosemary. She was the best we had. Rosemary Breslin died at 47 yesterday in Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital. She was a writer and lived on blood transfusions for the last 14 years. In the last six years, she had transfusions every 12 days. She fought with raw and endless courage and made it look so easy. She loved life so much and lived with such grace and dignity, and, above all, high humor. She wrote beautifully. She was the daughter of the late Rosemary Dattolico Breslin and Jimmy Breslin, and stepdaughter of Ronnie M. Eldridge. She was married to Anthony Dunne, son of Jean and Richard Dunne of Harwichport, MA. She leaves brothers Kevin, James, Patrick and Christopher and sister Kelly, and many friends, bereft. All of us still think we can talk to her. A service will be held at 2:30 PM, Thursday, at St. Francis of Assisi R.C. Church, 135 West 31st St. Before dying, she dictated to her stepmother a list of people she didn't want to attend her funeral. In lieu of flowers, contributions to the Rosemary Breslin Fund for MDS at Memorial Sloan - Kettering, 1275 York Ave., New York, NY 10021 will be appreciated.
