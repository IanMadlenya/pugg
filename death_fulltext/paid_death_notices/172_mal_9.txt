        MODELL-Michael S. Forty-eight years ago God sent an angel to us who showered our lives with countless blessings and whose passing fills our hearts with unbearable sorrow. Our precious and beautiful son Michael was our inspiration. Our joy was to look at him, to know him, and to love him. Now, all our joy has gone. He gave the world his joy and laughter, his brilliance and integrity, his boundless courage, and his abiding compassion. For 34 years, he suffered the capricious and excruciating pain of Crohn's disease with incredible grace and valor. He poured all his love and concern into his family and dedicated himself to helping others who battled inflammatory bowel disease. Together with his brave and beautiful wife Abby, he raised millions of dollars for medical research and worked tirelessly on behalf of the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America. He touched the lives of millions of people whose lives are ravaged by Crohn's and Colitis and gave them hope, encouragement and a shining example of how much one person can do to ease the suffering of others. During the past three years, Michael valiantly fought cancer, the last cruel complication of Crohn's disease. As he lay dying, he gave no thought to himself but only to his family. To each of us, he spoke precious words of love and gratitude. He died as he lived, with beauty, grace, compassion, courage, dignity, and boundless love. For his wife, Abby, his children Alex, Andrew and Ashley, his brother Mitchell, his sister Leslie, his nieces Shawn, Melissa, Brittany, and baby Ashley, for all his family, friends, associates, for everyone who was touched by Michael, and for us, his parents, the only words that can express our grief echo Jacob's cry in Genesis: Our angel is gone and we will mourn him till our deaths. Mom and Dad
        MODELL-Michael. The Board and staff of the Greater New York Chapter, Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA), are devastated by the tragic and untimely loss of its beloved Board Member and friend, Michael S. Modell. Following in the tradition of his parents, CCFA's esteemed CoFounders and Board Members, Shelby and William D. Modell, Michael embraced the goals of the Foundation and, with fierce determination and skill, championed its cause to find a cure for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. With passion and inspired leadership he served as a Trustee for over eighteen years-seven as Vice President of Fundraising. Taking over the reins from his parents in 1993, Michael and his wife Abby chaired the Chapter's Annual Dinner and Journal, the Foundation's most financially successful event. For the past three years Michael fought his illness valiantly and with great strength. He taught us all the meaning of dignity and extraordinary courage. We loved, admired and respected Michael and will forever miss his indomitable spirit and friendship. We extend our love and heartfelt sympathy to Michael's beloved family-wife Abby, children Ashley, Andrew and Alexander, parents Shelby and Bill, sister Leslie, brother Mitchell and sister-in-law Robin. May they derive comfort in the knowledge that they are in our hearts and prayers.

        MODELL-Michael S. My loving uncle who stepped in my life to replace my dad when he disappeared. At this vulnerable age, I looked for love and guidance and you appeared daily to lessen my pain with love and concern. You were always there for me with open arms. You always called me your fourth child, and I will always remain your oldest child. Although you were very ill, you promised me you would come to my graduation at Tufts University. You rented a bus with a bathroom and rested for the entire trip. As usual, you were there for me with ''bells on.'' You have always encouraged me and always told me that you were so proud of me. You have been a role model for me and I will always follow your example. I will always be there for Alex, Andrew and Ashley and continue to teach them the values that you have taught me. I will miss you and love you for the rest of my life. Most of all, thank you for always being there and for being my daddy. Love, Shawn
