        SAMMUL-Oscar Roger, from a heart attack in his Alexandria, Virginia, apartment on October 13, 1999, the eve of his 86th birthday. A native New Yorker, Mr. Sammul obtained a Bachelor's Degree in chemistry from C.C.N.Y. and a Master's Degree in education from Columbia University. He then worked for the New York City Board of Education until World War II interrupted his employment. He served with distinction as an Army captain in the European theatre until war's end in 1945. After the war, he returned to his major field, teaching science at Thiel College in Greenville, PA. He next accepted a research position with the old Army Chemical Corps in Denver, CO. This led to his final career position as a pharmaceutical chemist with the Food and Drug Administration in Washington, DC, where he retired with a commendable record. He remained in the northern Virginia area and gave a greater emphasis to his hobbies and avocations. Favorites included gardening, antiques, the stock market and keeping abreast of developments in scientific fields of interest. Some of these activities were curtailed when his wife, Phyllis, died in 1992. Oscar Roger Sammul leaves behind as closest kin his beloved cousin, Dorothy Jeisi, of Whiting, NJ. Family members, colleagues and friends already miss Oscar, but take comfort in cherished memories of a quiet, gentle, unobtrusive and modest man, much admired and respected in both professional and social circles.
