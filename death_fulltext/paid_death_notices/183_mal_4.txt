        KAUFMAN-David, M.D. The National Board of Trustees and staff of the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA) are deeply saddened by the loss of this beloved physician, dedicated volunteer, and dear friend. An eminent gastroenterologist, Dr. Kaufman served on the CCFA New Jersey Chapter Medical Advisory Committee, and was a physician member of the foundation for more than 20 years. He and his wife, Honey, who served on the national board of trustees and as chapter president, contributed enormously to CCFA's growth. We offer our heartfelt sympathy to Honey, and to his daughter, Esther Harper; sons, Bob and Larry; sister, Allison Wellen; and his grandchild. Dr. Kaufman has had a profound impact on the lives of people with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. We will never forget him. Eugene A. Kestenbaum Chairperson of the Board Charles O. Elson, M.D. Chairperson, National Scientific Advisory Committee Rodger L. DeRose President and CEO
