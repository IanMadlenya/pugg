        LAWFORD-Betty H. December 19, 1998, in West Palm Beach, FL. Widow of Charles Edward Lawford. Survived by her sister, Margo Stevens of Naples, FL, and two Stevens nephews, Bob and Tim. For we devoted friends, she will always be the wordsmith whose humor never failed us and our top notch croquet maven. Bravo, Betty. At her request no services will be held.
