        LaHOTAN-Robert. A painter known for landscapes and still lifes of lyrical color and subtle force, died on August 30, 2002. Whether he was painting the Maine forest at dusk or a bouquet of wild flowers in morning light, LaHotan brought to his work an abiding sense of mystery, a personal way of distilling a poetic moment from the canvases' ethereal depths. LaHotan is represented by the Kraushaar Galleries in New York; his paintings are in private and public collections across the United States. He was a member of the National Academy of Art, and a recipient of a Fulbright Grant in 1951. LaHotan lived in New York City and Cranberry Island, Maine, with his lifelong companion, the painter John Heliker, who died in 2000. Their home on Cranberry Island will become the center for the Heliker-LaHotan Foundation. Memorial celebrations are being planned in New York City and on Cranberry Island. Donations can be made to: The Heliker-LaHotan Foundation, Inc, PO Box 82, Great Cranberry Island, Maine 04625.
        LaHOTAN-Robert. We remember with great affection and respect Robert LaHotan, painter, teacher, and Faculty Fellow, who died August 30, 2002 in Bangor, Maine at 75 years old. After coming to New York to study painting at Columbia University, LaHotan taught painting and art history to generations of Dalton students over 36 years. Characterized by a spirit of optimism and acceptance, his teaching inspired many a budding artist and fostered creativity among everyone around him. Ellen C. Stein, Head of School
