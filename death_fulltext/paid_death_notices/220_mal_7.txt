        MANDELL -- Edward. Ed gently took his leave on Tuesday, April 26th, one day shy of his 86th birthday. He lived in New York City and was a partner and creative director of Richard and Edwards advertising agency. He was the recipient of his industry's highest awards the Clio and the ''Andy''. He bought a home in these beautiful Berkshires over twenty years ago and was a full time resident for the last five years. Ed was an avid reader, a passionate music lover, one heck of a partner on the dance floor and a very funny guy. He leaves his wife Barbara, his sons James of Santa Monica, Jeffrey and his wife Abigail Jones of Beverly Hills, his step-son Barney Charlon and his wife Linda Bennett of Washington, DC and three grandchildren, Juliana, Alex and Danny. He was dearly loved by all who knew him and will be sorely missed. A celebration of his life will be held at a date to be announced.
