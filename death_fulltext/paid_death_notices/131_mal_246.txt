        FASANELLA-Ralph. The Officers and staff of 1199 National Health & Human Service Employees Union mourn the passing of a true artist of the people in the tradition of Paul Robeson and Woody Guthrie. Ralph was a dedicated labor union organizer who fought in Spain with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. A self-taught painter, he was ''discovered'' after thirty years in obscurity. His hero was the American worker whose ''wails'' and joys ring through his art. His dream was of an America with strong, humane unions concerned with all the needs and interest of its members-for Bread and Roses, too. We in 1199 were proud to be his friend. We extend our condolences and sympathy to his wife Eva and the family. Dennis Rivera, President Moe Foner, Director 1199's Bread & Roses Cultural Project
