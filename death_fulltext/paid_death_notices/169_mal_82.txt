        AMES-George. The Camp Rising Sun community mourns the passing of a cherished friend. George was our first camper and went on to serve as music counselor, camp director, and then Director, President and Chairman of the Louis August Jonas Foundation. We will miss his guiding spirit, wise counsel, and generous heart.
