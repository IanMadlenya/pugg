        ALDWELL--Edward, brilliant performing artist, master teacher, and gifted author of music textbooks, is forever etched in the memories of his many students and colleagues at Curtis over the past 35 years. He brought a performer's intensity, a scholar's intellect, and a deep humanity overflowing with humor and insight to all of his activities on stage, in the classroom, and in daily life. His recordings and his books will keep him with us in a tangible way even though his inimitable spirit, wit, and intellectual integrity may pass this way only once. The entire Curtis family sends condolences and our deepest sympathies to his wife and family. H.F. (Gerry) Lenfest, Chairman, Board of Trustees Roberto Diaz, President The Curtis Institute of Music
