        PIORE-Nora Kahn. The faculty, students, alumni and staff of Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health mourn the passing of its esteemed faculty member, Nora Kahn Piore. A professor of public health economics from 1972 to 1982, she enjoyed a varied career that spanned fifty years working on issues related to health insurance, health economics and policy analysis for New York City's Commissioners of Health, Hospitals and Welfare. To her children, grandchildren and sister, we extend deepest sympathy. Allan Rosenfield, MD Dean
