        THEODORE-Jack N. On Dec. 14, 2000, we lost Jack N. Theodore. He was the loving husband of Maria and the fabulous father of Sabina. His great spirit, passion for the opera, love of literature, dry sense of humor & unbelievable courage will be forever missed. He will always live in our hearts. Services will be held at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Ave. at 81st Street, Monday, December 18, at 9:30 AM. In lieu of flowers, contributions in his memory may be made to the Ronald McDonald House, Greek Division.
