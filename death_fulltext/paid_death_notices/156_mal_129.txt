        McCOLLUM-Gordon. On January 7. Beloved brother of Holly M. Schenck and companion of Andrea Anson, and adored uncle of Ted, Liz, Will and Chip Schenck. Died peacefully at New York Hospital following a 4 month battle with cancer. Gordon McCollum was a lover of New York City and an avid student of its history, art and architecture. Following a career as a successful executive in commercial real estate he acquired the American Architectural Archives, a collection of books and documents on the city which he made available to scholars and writers. His curiousity and enthusiasm for life and his surroundings never abated and will remain a source of joy and inspiration for all who knew him. Plans for a memorial service will be announced at a later date.
