        ACKERMAN-Jordan, Dr. Those who were with Jordan and Sally this past Shabbat for their son, Evan's Bar Mitzvah will never forget it. He was determined to be there and was successful. May God accept his Neshama and offer comfort and strength to all who mourn. Laurence A. Feldman, President Rabbi Myron M. Fenster Assoc Rabbi David N. Weizman
