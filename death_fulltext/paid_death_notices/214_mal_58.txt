        BASSIN--Alexander, Ph.D. An impasse had been reached by the early sixties. Long lines of this Town's young, addicted and lost, were filing into already crowded jail cells. With no end in sight, a lone Research Chief of the Brooklyn Supreme Court sounded the call for a new way-a revolutionary treatment alternative called DAYTOP. A prolific writer, he introduced DAYTOP to the world via a classical article in ''Psychology Today'' which captured the attention of the Nation. That New Yorker was Doctor Alexander Bassin who went onto God at 92 years in Tallahassee, FL where he served as Dean of the School of Criminology at Florida State University and Founder of a Daytop-Model, DISC Village in that city. Our prayerful support to his beloved Ann and the Family. (Msgr.) William B. O'Brien Pres., Daytop Village, Inc.
