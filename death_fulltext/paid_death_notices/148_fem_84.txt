        WINOGRAD-Emma. It is with great sadness that the families of the Canavan Research Fund mourn the passing of one-year-old baby Emma who was born with Canavan disease. Our hearts and prayers are with Andrea and Robert, Emma's adoring parents and dedicated CRF board members, and Emma's big sister, Madison Birnbaum. Her spirit will live on in all of us as we continue to fight for a cure. Canavan Research Fund Jordana Sontag, President Roger Karlin, Vice President
