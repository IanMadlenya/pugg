        SAMUELS-Judith. The Men's Club of Congregation Emanu-El of the City of New York expresses deep sorrow at the untimely death of our administrative assistant, Judy Samuels. She will be missed but never forgotten. Martin A. Danoff, President
        SAMUELS-Judith Gail, died January 3, 2001, age 57. All her friends who were the beneficiaries of her warm, generous spirit and her spontaneous sense of humor will miss her beyond words. We will also miss her love of food and wine and so will Zagat, Arthur Avenue, and numerous restaurants. We will miss her reviews of theater, opera, concerts, and her travels. We will celebrate her life with a loud and joyous toast. Goodbye Judy, we love you.
