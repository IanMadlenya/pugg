        ROSTOW - Eugene, The Dean and Faculty of Yale Law School mark with profound sadness the passing of our friend and colleague, Eugene Rostow, former Dean and Sterling Professor Emeritus of Law and Public Affairs. His intellect, will, and character were molding forces in the evolution of the modern Yale Law School; his legacy of principled public service is a model for us all. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his family. Anthony T. Kronman, Dean, Yale Law School
