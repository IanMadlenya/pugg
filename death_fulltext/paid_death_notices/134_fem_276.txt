        ZEIGER-Harriette V. Died suddenly but peacefully in her home on March 26, 1998. She leaves behind her son R. Anthony Zeiger; her daughter Nancy Sylvor; her two grandchildren, Jeffrey and Andrew Zeiger; her beloved cousin Norman Rubin and her dearest friend, Ellen Rosenthal DeSario. She remained so vigorous in mind, body and spirit until the moment she left us, that now it must be time for her to rest. Go with love, dear one, but this world is a little darker for your leaving it.
