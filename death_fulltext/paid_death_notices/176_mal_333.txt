        POLATSCH-Laurence M. September 11, 2001. In celebration of our Laurence lovingly called a ''Winna Baby'' from day one. Our tears are eased by smiles at the thought of the special young man you've been. You and Danny, although different, were role models for brothers everywhere. As a son to our Linda and to Buddy you were compassionate and loving and all that a son should be. You're twinkling eyes have lit up the skies saying I'm ok, you be ok. Love you, Gram Mama Rose and Great Aunt Eleanor
