        NELSON-Leonard, Dr., founding Chairman and Emeritus Professor of Physiology at the Medical College of Ohio at Toledo, died Wednesday, December 8, in the Heartland of Perrysburg Nursing Center near Toledo. He was 79. He died almost eight weeks after suffering an incapacitating stroke. Born in Philadelphia, Dr. Nelson received his Bachelor's Degree in Zoology at the University of Pennsylvania and his Master's and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. After eight years in the Department of Physiology at the University of Nebraska, he pursued research in reproductive physiology at the University of Chicago from 1953 to 1956. The following seven years at Emory University were interrupted by a year at Cambridge University in England, where he did research as a visiting scientist. Although Dr. Nelson actively engaged in research and medical teaching at Medical College of Ohio from 1967 until his retirement in 1991, he was given many opportunities to present papers at international conferences. He worked as a visiting scientist as a guest of Professor Prudent Padieu at the University of Dijon in France and of Professor Marco Crippa at the University of Geneva in Switzerland in 1975-76. As the guest of Professor Alberto Monroy in 198384, he spent a year in Naples, Italy, at the internationally renowned Stazione Zoologica. Dr. Nelson leaves his wife, Anne (Saturen); a daughter, Pamela Nelson, of Raleigh, NC, and a grandson, Phi lip Gordon, at Brown University. There will be no funeral. A remembrance is planned by the family in Woods Hole in early July. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Marine Resources Department at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.
