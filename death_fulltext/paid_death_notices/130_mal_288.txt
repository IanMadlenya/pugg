        DRESDALE-David, M.D. The Division of Cardiology at Maimonides Medical Center mourns the loss of a devoted physician, superb clinician and dedicated teacher. David Dresdale distinguished himself over many decades of service to his patients and to Maimonides Medical Center. He integrated unbending scientific principles with the application of compassionate, clinical medicine into a unique blend, defining the art of medicine. He served as an example of excellence for generations of physicians and he will be sorely missed.
