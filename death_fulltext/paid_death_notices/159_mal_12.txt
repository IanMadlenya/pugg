        SILFEN-Herman. The Board of Trustees, staff, and consumers of YAI/National Institute for People with Disabilities are deeply saddened by the passing of Hy Silfen. Hy was a longtime advocate for people with developmental disabilities, an active and committed YAI board member, an extraordinary supporter of staff development and quality programs. Hy was also a caring family member and when we think of him we are reminded that a man is judged not just by his successes but also by the values which he instills in his children. Hy's children, David, Ellen, and Susan, are his legacy of generosity and dedication to helping people with disabilities. His personal involvement will be greatly missed by all of us. We extend our condolences to his entire family. Marcella Fava, Chairman Dr. Paul H. Levitz, Vice Chairman Board of Trustees Dr. Joel M. Levy Dr. Philip H.
