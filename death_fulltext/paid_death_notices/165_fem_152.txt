        BULLATY-Sonja. With great sorrow, all of us at the International Center of Photography note the passing of Sonja Bullaty. Her warmhearted cheerfulness and love of photography were a constant in the field for many years. She will be sorely missed and we extend our deep condolences to Angelo Lomeo, her companion in life and photography. Cornell Capa, Director Emeritus Willis Hartshorn, Director ICP
