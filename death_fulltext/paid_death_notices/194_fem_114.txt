        JONES-Marie Hicks (Rie). 80, on January 5, 2003, at Medford Leas, Medford, NJ. Devoted wife and best friend to Breckinridge. Beloved mother of Lissa and Deb and mother-in-law of Greg and Jeff. Fabulous grandmother to Sam and Cody. On her birthday we miss her generosity, humor and small gestures greatly done.
