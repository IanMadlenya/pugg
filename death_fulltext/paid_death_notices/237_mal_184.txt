        HURLEY--James Lance, of Greenwich, CT, beloved husband of Martha Nold Hurley, also of Greenwich, and father of Joanna Thorne Hurley, of Santa Fe, NM, died on his 80th birthday, October 16th, surrounded by loved ones. Beloved and respected by all who knew him, he was born in Montclair, NJ, and raised there and in Brooklyn, NY. He graduated from Poly Prep in Brooklyn, and with a BA from Yale University in 1947. A member of the elite V-12 officer training program, of the U.S. Navy, he served in the Korean war, and attained the rank of Lieutenant Junior Grade before being honorably discharged. He was married for 30 years to Nancie Keating Hurley, mother of Joanna, and for 10 years to Timmie Ogdon Hurley, who died in 1994. He worked for the Union Service Corporation of New York for many years, and retired in 1988 as a Senior Vice President of equity funds for the brokerage firm J&W Seligman. We will all miss this distinguished, noble and generous man, who will be remembered for his strength of character, his quiet grace and dignity, and his open heart. A memorial service will be held at the Stanwich Congregational Church, in Greenwich, CT, on Friday, October 20th, at 2pm.
