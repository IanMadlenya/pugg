        WILK-Elliott. He was a brave, caring Judge who carefully listened to poor people and the voiceless, seeking justice in New York's courts. He became a friend to CCR, officiating at our ''merger ceremony'' with the National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee. We lovingly embrace Betty, Daniel and David at this sad time.
