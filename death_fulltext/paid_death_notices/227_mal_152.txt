Ernie was a remarkable friend, a staunch supporter and a respected trustee of our institution since its inception in 1968. There can be no doubt that the formation, development and healthy growth of our institution has been greatly shaped and guided under his careful watch. We will deeply miss his eloquence, counsel and companionship. We express our condolences to his wife Sara and son Erik. Robert G.
