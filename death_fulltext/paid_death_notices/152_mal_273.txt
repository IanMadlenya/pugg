        TREVOR-Leigh B. Age 65, on Tuesday, September 21, 1999, in Cleveland, Ohio. The lawyers and staff of Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue are deeply saddened by the loss of our colleague and friend, Leigh Trevor, a brilliant corporate lawyer and graduate of Harvard University and Harvard Law School, whose 37-year legal career was defined by his expertise in the area of hostile takeovers. A codrafter of the Ohio Control Share Acquisition Act, Leigh was past president of the Stakeholders of America, a coalition of major American companies that sought to reform takeover law. We will forever remember Leigh with unparalleled fondness, not only as a distinguished lawyer, but as a man of great character, of broad intelligence and sensitivity, and of engaging wit. Our lives were enriched by our long association with him, and our heartfelt thoughts are with his family. Donations may be made to the Dean S. and Lee Jean Barry Trevor Memorial Fund, Knox College, 2 E. South Street, K230, Galesburg, IL 61401, or to the American Cancer Society, 1148 Euclid Avenue, Suite 514, Cleveland, OH. 44115.
