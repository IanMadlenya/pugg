        MURPHY-Dr. Joseph S. On behalf of the Board, the members and the students of the Consortium for Worker Education, we express our profound sadness over the passing of our friend and colleague, Dr. Joseph S. Murphy. He was a dedicated advocate and leader who never forgot the importance of educational opportunity for working men and women in the labor movement. His commitment to worker education programs in CUNY will long be remembered both within and outside of the classroom. His companionship, sense of humor and intellect will be deeply missed. We express our sincere condolences to his family. Barry Feinstein, Chairman Joseph McDermott, Exec. Dir.
