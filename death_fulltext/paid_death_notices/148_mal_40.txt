        KALMAN-Tibor. The Architectural League notes with great sadness the death of the designer, humanist, and provocateur Tibor Kalman. Tibor stirred things up, brilliantly. His absence will leave a huge hole in the design community, in NY and internationally. Frank Lupo, President Rosalie Genevro, Executive Dir.
        KALMAN-Tibor. The staff and the Board of Trustees of CooperHewitt, National Design Museum, Smithsonian Institution honor designer Tibor Kalman. His presence in the international cultural community will be sorely missed but lives on the museum's M&Co Archives, donated by Mr. Kalman in 1993.
        KALMAN-Tibor. As we say our sad good-byes and send our condolences to Maira, Lulu and Alex, we anticipate seeing some interesting cloud formations, better groupings of constellations and possibly a longer spring. Thank you Tibor, the pleasure was ours. Board, Staff of Creative Time
