        POPPER-Felix. New York City Opera deeply mourns the passing of one of its most beloved and august members. Felix has been a member of the company since 1959, as an administrator, conductor, coach and mentor. He was Music Administrator for over thirty years, and a principal part of the team responsible for many of City Opera's major successes. Long before the creation of apprentice programs, Felix was a professional and personal mentor to several generations of young singers at the City Opera and at the many schools in which he worked. His stories of the great artists and his vast knowledge of operas, especially those of Richard Strauss, enthralled generations of singers. Always with a twinkle in his eye, he has been there to support, advise, chide, cajole and cheer the success of his many students and friends. He leaves a void that cannot be filled. Our deepest condolences go to his wife Doris and his son Richard. The funeral service will be on Wednesday, December 20 at 11:15 am, at Riverside Memorial Chapels, 180 West 76th Street, NYC. In lieu of flowers the family requests donations be made to the American Parkinson Disease Association, Inc., 1250 Hylan Blvd, #
