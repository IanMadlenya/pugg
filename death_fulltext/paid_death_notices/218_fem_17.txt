        ADAMS--Ruth S. With great sadness and a deep sense of loss, the American Academy mourns the death of Ruth Salzman Adams, former editor of the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists and a Fellow of the Academy since 1985. Throughout her life, Ruth worked for the cause of peace and international cooperation. She was one of the first participants in the Pugwash International Conferences on Science and World Affairs--a movement long supported by the Academy--and she worked tirelessly to promote nongovernmental exchange between Western and Soviet scientists. At the Academy, she was a leader in the establishment of the International Centre for Insect Physiology and Ecology in Nairobi Kenya and the co-author (with William McNeill) of a book on the historical and contemporary impact of human migration. We extend our sincere condolences to her husband, Robert, also a member of the Academy, and to her family. For all those who shared her commitment to international understanding and were fortunate to know her sensitivity and kindness, her generosity and friendship, she will remain in our thoughts.
