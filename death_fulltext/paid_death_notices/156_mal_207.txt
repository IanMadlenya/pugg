        MARBY-David, M.D. We are deeply saddened by the untimely death of our esteemed colleague on January 8, 2000. As a Pediatric Emergency Medicine Attending Physician and Assistant Clinical Professor of Pediatrics, Dave established himself as a dedicated and committed Pediatrician who tirelessly served children in need, particularly those in the Washington Heights community. He was a highly motivated basic science researcher and made important contributions to the field of infectious desease. Most significantly, he was a true friend to, and supporter of his colleagues at work. He will be sorely missed by all of us who worked along side him. We extend our deepest condolences to his familiy and close friends.
