        MYERS-Judy. Of Aventura, FL, peacefully on August 18, 2001. Beloved wife for 48 years of Sydney. Devoted mother of Jody and Robert. Adored grandmother of Michael, Matthew, Ryan and Dylan. Loving sister of Linda. Cherished aunt of Robin, Jillian, Kevin and the late Jordan. Great-aunt to Kaitlyn. Dear sister-in-law of Philip and Jennifer. Whoever needed a sister, she was their sister, when someone needed a friend, she was that friend, whoever needed a confidant, she was that too. Her heart was big enough to accept all who needed refuge, understanding and comfort. She will be deeply missed and remembered forever. In lieu of flowers please send donations to your favorite charity.
        MYERS-Judy. The profound loss of my sister is overwhelming. She was my sister, my mother and my best friend. In everyone's life they should have someone who loves them unconditionally. I had that with this wonderful woman I called ''My Sister.'' Her love for her husband Sydney, her children Jody and Robert, were unending. But she shined and glowed as grandmother to Mike, Matt, Ryan and Dylan. This special woman will live in my heart forever. Sister, I Love You. Linda
