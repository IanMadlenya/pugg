        SHAPIRO-Ivan. The Board of Directors and the staff of the NY Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU) are deeply saddened by the death of our former board member, Treasurer and friend. We extend condolence to his wife Maria and his daughters Lisa Kubiske and Alexandra Shapiro. Ivan was a committed civil libertarian whose vision, strength and dignity assisted in the development of the NYCLU. We will forever be in debt to this special person. We will miss his leadership and humanitarianism. Steven J. Hyman, President Norman Siegel, Executive Dir.
