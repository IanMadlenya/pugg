        ROBBINS-Eleanor L. ''Elly''. Died peacefully in her sleep in her New York apartment on February 16th at 85. She served for 11 years as Chairman of Public Relations for Greater New York for the American Red Cross. Elly Robbins began her Red Cross career in 1939 and put in 49 years of dedicated volunteer service to both the American and International Red Cross all over the globe. In 1989, Mrs. Robbins was a recipient of the Harriman Award for Distinguished Volunteer Service, the highest award presented by the Red Cross to a volunteer. Between 1965 and 1979 Robbins visited 17 national Red Cross societies establishing public relations programs where none had existed. On Christmas Eve in 1988, Robbins traveled to the Thai/Cambodian border to bring good wishes to an American Red Cross medical team. Mrs. Robbins worked to develop new materials and in a highly competitive market she succeeded in significantly enhancing the access of the Red Cross to electronic media. Born Eleanor Landau, she was married nearly four decades to attorney Manuel L. Robbins (d. 1976). Mrs. Robbins is survived by her children Thomas Robbins and Liz Robbins, and her granddaughter Robin Johnson, daughter of Liz Robbins and her husband, Doug Johnson. She will be greatly missed by friends, family and colleagues. Memorial donations should be sent to the Red Cross-Harlem Chapter.
