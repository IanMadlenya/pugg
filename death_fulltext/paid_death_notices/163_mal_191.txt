        WOLKE-Marshall. The United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism mourns the passing of Marshall Wolke, International President of the United Synagogue from 1981-85 and longtime leader of the USCJ Midwest Region. During his many years of service to our organization, he demonstrated a firm commitment to Jewish living and to the State of Israel. A kind and compassionate man, he will long be remembered as a respected teacher and community activist. We extend our condolences to his children Judy, Joe, and Jay and to their families. Stephen S. Wolnek, International President Rabbi Jerome M. Epstein, Executive Vice-Presiden
