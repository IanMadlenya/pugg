        EDELSTEIN--Haskell. On this date, 16 years ago, Haskell Edelstein was elected as Trustee of The New York Youth Symphony, serving each of those years with undemanding dedication and a passion for the young musicians whose lives were touched forever because of his caring and generosity. Symbolic of his love of music was his wearing of a lapel pin in the form of a mouthpiece reed used to play the bassoon, an instrument he loved dearly. Heartfelt thoughts go to loving wife Joan, their children and grandchild. Board of Trustees N.Y. Youth Symphony Barry Goldberg, Exec. Dir. >>AD#
