        JOHNSON-Frank M. Jr. The Directors of the Drum Major Institute wish to express their profound sympathy to the Johnson family, and to the nation at large, at the passing of a great man and a superlative jurist. Judge Frank M. Johnson Jr.'s many landmark decisions broke the cadence of segregation, and allowed the South to begin its march toward racial harmony. As we strive today to set a beat for the new millennium, we will remain ever mindful of his courage, vision, and vigilance in pursuing the ideal of equal justice for all.
