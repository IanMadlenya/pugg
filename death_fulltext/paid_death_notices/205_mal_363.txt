        GUTMAN -- Jeremiah S. 1923-2004. ''I say beware of anyone or any religion or any government, whether supported by its religion or otherwise, which says there is only one truth and you better believe it because...we have it. That is a terribly dangerous thing. It leads to suppression, tyranny, and dehumanization of the individual.'' --Jeremiah Gutman, 1998. The American Civil Liberties Union and the New York Civil Liberties Union are deeply saddened by the death of our friend and colleague, Jeremiah Gutman, a lifelong activist and lawyer on the frontlines of justice. A longtime leader and board member of the NYCLU and a member of the ACLU board until his death, he fought anticommunist witch-hunts in the 1950s, racial injustice in the 1960s, and censorship and police abuse of protestors throughout his life. His passing stills one of liberty's most eloquent voices, but his cause lives on.
