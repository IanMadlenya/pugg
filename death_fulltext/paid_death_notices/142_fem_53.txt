        MELDOLA-Rosemarie M.D. The Faculty and Staff of New York University School of Medicine deeply mourn the loss of Rosemarie Ingeborg Meldola, MD, age 89. A dedicated pediatrician and longtime faculty member of the Department of Pediatrics. A native of Germany, Dr. Meldola received her medical degree in 1934 from the University of Hamburg. The rise of the Nazis interfered with her medical education-as a Jew she couldn't obtain an internship in a recognized hospital. She spent the next four years assisting her father Eduardo, also a physician in his medical practice. In 1938 she immigrated to Holland and worked underground in two hospitals in Amsterdam during the Nazi occupation until she was deported to the concentration camps of Auschwitz Bergen Belsen and Buchenwald where she also served as a physician. Dr. Meldola immigrated to the United States in 1947. After completing a research fellowship in tuberculosis at Bellevue Hospital, an affiliate of NYU Medical Center, she became a faculty member in the Department of Pediatrics in 1953. She was also in private practice for many years in New York City. She retired in 1983. We extend our deepest sympathy to her family. Robert M.
