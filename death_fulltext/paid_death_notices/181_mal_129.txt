        SHEARER-Hartley Parker. On February 7, 2002, at age 57 in Williamstown, MA. Born in New York City and a longtime resident there, he leaves his loving wife of 35 years, Linda and his devoted son, Ivor. Earning his living as a landlord he dedicated his life to art and public service, and changed the lives of countless students, friends and strangers in unexpected ways. He attended Middlebury College and earned a BFA from NYU in 1968. He had been a part-time lecturer in art at Williams College since 1991 and was pursuing a MSW at SUNY-Albany when he suffered a stroke in 1999. The last three years were filled with challenges and struggles which even he could not overcome. He will be greatly missed by his family and many friends. A memorial gathering will take place on Saturday, February 16. Please call 413597-2318 for time and location. In lieu of flowers contributions may be made to the Berkshire Farm Center and Services for Youth in Canaan, NY.
