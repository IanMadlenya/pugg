        PESKIN -- Marilyn, died peacefully on May 27, 2003 at the age of 71. Beloved wife of Ira Peskin for 50 years. Cherished mother of Jill Saunders and Jeffrey Peskin, the daughter of the late May and Dave Schlissal and sister to Jerry Schlissal. Also survived by her two grandchildren, Michael and David Saunders, who lovingly called her ''Mama,'' and will miss her greatly. Mama was a woman of grace, elegance and charm. To know Mama is to love Mama. A special goodbye from her son-in-law, Jeff Saunders, who wishes she were here to see his flowers. Goodbye, Mama Marilyn, we all love you. >>AD#
