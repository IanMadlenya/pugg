        BORUT-Abraham, 93. Born in NYC, November 11, 1908; Longtime resident of Riverdale, NY and Putnam County, NY. A graduate of the Baruch School at City College, he started his career at the City College Club, opened a mirror-specialty business and took over Interstate Mechanical Laboratories, Inc. His business and personal life was guided by a strong ethical sense. A lifelong tinkerer, he never bought what he could build, re-use or re-wire, beginning with his first clubhouse, built of recycled timbers from Yankee Stadium. A true New Yorker, he paddled the Hudson River in a masted canoe, as a child, cheered the Yankees for decades, and read The New York Times with relish. Abraham had a warmth and exceptional dedication to family. He is survived by Helen, his wife of 67 years, two sons, Donald and Allan of Washington, D.C., two grandsons, Adam and Ezra, and two great-grandchildren, Chloe and Alexandre. Memorial service at the Riverdale Temple, Sunday, November 10, 2002, 2 PM. Contributions to: Riverdale Temple, Bronx, NY.
