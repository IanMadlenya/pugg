        ABRAHAM--Ruth. We regret to announce the passing of our dear mother, mother-inlaw, grandmother and great grandmother. Interment was in Israel on Tuesday, August 26. The traditional seven days of mourning began in Israel and will continue at her last residence 578 Trysting Pl, Cedarhurst, NY on Thursday, Friday, Saturday night, Sunday, and Monday morning. She was a true women of valor with a heart of gold who endured the worst of the Holocaust through the compassion of others, particularly Maria, and then devoted her life to repaying that selfless act. She was a deeply devout person who drew strength from her religious beliefs. We will miss her sorely. Abraham Sokolow and Shachar families
