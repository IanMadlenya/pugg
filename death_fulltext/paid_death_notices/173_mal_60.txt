        McMURRAY-Joseph P. The Queens College Community is saddened by the passing of Joseph P. McMurray, President of Queens College/CUNY from 1965-1971. After a long career in public service, he came to Queens College during a time of multiple challenges and transformations, when enrollment at the college reached a high point of 28,000. He was devoted to improving communication with the college community and reached out to involve faculty and students in making crucial decisions. He strongly supported sharing of power through their participation in an effective and collegial academic senate. He is remembered as a dedicated and courageous leader willing to confront tough decisions, and one who believed deepely in the ability of higher education to achieve a more equitable society. We extend our deepest sympathies to his family. Russell Hotzler, Acting Pres. & The Queens College Community
