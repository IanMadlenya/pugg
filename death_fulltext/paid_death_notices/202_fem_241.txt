        VERDERY -- Suzanne (Ald rich). 83, died November 20, 2003, in her home, Camden, ME. Born on November 8, 1920, Fall River, MA, the daughter of The Right Rev. Donald B. Aldrich and Frances (Learned) Aldrich. A graduate from Wellesley College (BA in History), and the wife of The Rev. John D. Verdery (1917-1985), Headmaster of The Wooster School (1943-1976), Danbury, CT. Few women are as liberated from the bounds of their sex, the restrictions of motherhood, the etiquette of table and parlor, the confusions of the church, and the will of God as Suzanne Verdery was; and few-men or women-are as specifically proud of their sex, mindful of their parenthood, devoted to the common sense of courtesy, meaningful in their worship and obedient to The Word as she was. Suzanne Verdery is survived by her four children-Joan, Daniel, Donald, Benjamin--and six grandchildren. Memorial service: James Marshall Chapel, Wooster School, Danbury, CT, 2PM, March 27, 2004. Instead of flowers, donations may be made to PALS, P.O. Box 309, Camden, ME 04843 or to The John D. Verdery Library at The Wooster School, Ridgebury Rd, Danbury, CT 06810.
