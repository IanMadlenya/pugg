        FINKELSTEIN - Rebecca. Says ''see you later'' to her daughter Eileen Schlesinger, son-in-law Alan, grandchildren Sam, Libby, Sarah and Elizabeth, sister Evelyn, all of Rockaway, brother Lew and wife Pearl, nieces and nephews, and says ''hello again'' to her parents, husband Natie, sons David and Stewart, and sister Ethel. Shalom.
