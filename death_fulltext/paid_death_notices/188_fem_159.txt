        REINHART-Stephanie. The Board and staff of The Joyce Theater mourn the passing of our friend and colleague Stephanie Reinhart. We will miss her passion, knowledge and dedication to dancers and the art of dance. We send our deepest sympathies to her husband Charles, daughter Ariane and her family.
