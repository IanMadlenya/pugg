He was a uniquely charitable individual, proprietor of Far Rockaway Liquor Corp., Executive Director of the Chamber of Commerce of the Rockaways, accountant, business consultant and real estate investor. Having served in the Army and attended NYU, Irving was also a 32nd degree Mason. He founded and was an active Board member of Congregation Beth Emeth, Hewlett, N.Y. Irving leaves his loving wife of over 49 years, Audrey (nee Salzinger), children Barry, Stanley, Sandra, son-in-law Bill, grandchildren Paula and Joshua and a large ''extended'' family of friends. His humor, kindness, smile and joie de vivre will live on. He touched many with ''I think I love you.'' In lieu of flowers, the family asks that contributions be made to charities.
