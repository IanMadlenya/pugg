        WINTERS--Ben. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) mourn the loss of Ben Winters of Beverly Hills, CA. A driving, inspirational force in the ATS, he served as chairman and president of the Western Region and Southern California Chapter, and on the National Board of Directors, where he held positions as chair of the Campaign Cabinet and National Investment Committees. Vice president of Rabin-Winters, Inc. and founder of a successful consulting practice in mergers and acquisitions, Mr. Winter's passion for service dominated his life. Actively involved in a wide range of medical, educational and Jewish institutions in Southern California and Israel, he was a distinguished life trustee of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and past president of the Stephen S. Wise Temple. Demonstrating his profound belief in the Technion as the future of Israel, he and his beloved wife, Elaine, supported a variety of ATS projects, including the Ben and Elaine Winters Computer and Communications Network, which linked many of the Technion's research laboratories and departments to mainframe computers by fiber optics. In recognition of his dedicated service, Mr. Winters was presented with the Albert Einstein Award, the highest ATS honor. A member of the Technion International Board of Governors, he was recognized by the university with an honorary doctorate of science in technology and an honorary fellowship. We extend our sincere condolences to his wife Elaine, children Sherry and John David Winters, grandchildren, and the entire Winters family.
