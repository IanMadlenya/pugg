        BELFER-Hazzan Ben W. The Cantors Assembly records with sorrow the passing of a revered colleague of more than four decades. A graduate of the Juilliard School of Music and Hebrew Union College School of Sacred Music, he served as cantor of B'nai Shalom Congregation in Rockville, MD for more than 30 years. Simultaneously, Hazzan Belfer was a faculty member at the cantorial schools of the Jewish Theological Seminary and Hebrew Union College. He had studied voice with the famed opera singer, Robert Weede, and was regarded as one of the finest baritones of the modern cantorate. We extend our sympathy to his wife, Florence, his children and his loved ones. May his memory abide as a blessing. Hazzan Henry Rosenblum, Pres. Hazzan Stephen J. Stein, Exec. VP
