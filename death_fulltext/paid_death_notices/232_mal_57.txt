        SHAPIRO--Saul A. Of Westchester, NY and Scottsdale, AZ, died May 1 from cancer. A young and vigorous 80, Saul was an avid tennis player, cyclist, hiker and skier; above all, he was a dedicated private pilot. On the cusp of his 80th birthday, Saul piloted his Cessna Skymaster from Danbury, Connecticut to north of the Arctic Circle, touching down in Ft. Yukon, Alaska. He loved nothing more than tiring out younger companions on the ski slopes or tennis courts. Raised in New York City and a graduate of NYU, Saul first opted for the rugged life, working as a lumber jack in upstate New York. Later, he entered his father's business, serving as the production manager at the Tailored Junior Dress Company. Thereafter, he charted his own course, first in the sand and gravel business, then as a builder of apartments and retail centers and finally as a developer of real estate projects in the New York area and as an owner of the Buckingham Hotel. Saul, a humble person with a strong will, great moral character, deep curiosity and infinite patience, loved conversation, a sun-filled day, solving a construction challenge, pushing his physical limitations and looking down from 5,000 feet. And we, his loving wife Susan, and devoted son Stephen and daughter in-law Amy, will always turn our heads to the sky and look for ''3 Whiskey Whiskey'' when a white plane passes overhead. He is also survived by his sister Estelle and her family, niece Cheryl and nephew Sandy. Contributions may be made to the Joint Distribution Committee 212-687-6200; or the United Jewish Communities and Federations of North America 888-639-1919. A service will be held on May 11 at 2:30 PM at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 W. 76th St, in Manhattan.
