        MATERA-Barbara. Peter Martins and the New York City Ballet mourn the passing of our dear colleague and cherished friend, Barbar Matera. We shall always remember her compassion, her elegance, and, most certainly, her extraordinary talents. Barbara not only brought beauty to our stage, but also to our lives. Our hearts go out to dear Arthur, Jared, and all of those who knew and loved her as we did.
        MATERA-Barbara. The Board, staff and alumni of The Acting Company are deeply grieved by the passing of our beloved friend, supporter and passionately involved Board member. We extend our love and deepest sympathy to Arthur and to all at Barbara Matera, Ltd., who were truly her family. Edgar Lansbury, Chairman Joan Warburg, President Margot Harley, Producing Dir.
