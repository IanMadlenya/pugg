        BAUMSTEIN--Dorothy, died Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was born in Ostrowietz, Poland. She and her husband Bernard survived the Nazis and helped others do the same. In 1946 they were brought to New York by Bernard's older brothers and made a new life in the Bronx with their daughter Bina. Music and movies became Dorothy's passion, and she and Bernard won many dance contests together. In retirement they spent summers in Sag Harbor, near their beloved daughter, son-in-law Walter and granddaughter Sarah. Last May Dorothy fulfilled a wish by walking down the aisle at Sarah's wedding to Hugo Lindgren. In her last years, Dorothy was lovingly cared for by Bibi and Reuben Ledra. Funeral services will be held at Beth Moses Cemetery in Pinelawn, Long Island, Sunday, April 25, at 11 AM.
