        ASH--David H. July 4, 1922-January 24, 2006. David passed with his loved ones at his side. Born in E. Norwalk, Conn., David was preceded in death by parents Bessi and Harry, brothers Jacob and Barney, and sisters Miriam, Nedi and Ruth. His children Jodi, Marc and Robin, his grandson Morgan, and a loving extended family survive him. David was a graduate of Stamford High, Class of 1940. After graduation he served as an officer and fighter pilot in the United States Air Force. His passion for all things cars, especially racecars, led him to a highly accomplished career in the automotive world. He was a regular and distinguished competitor at Sebring, America's premier race. Between 1952 and 1957, David earned the title of ''Mr. MG'' as the only driver to start and finish five twelve-hour-long endurance races at Sebring in five tries. He also set numerous ''land speed'' records on the Bonneville Salt Flats in 1957. David later pursued a career in automotive journalism. His pieces appeared in ''The New York Times,'' ''Argosy Magazine'' and ''Esquire Magazine.'' He also served as publisher and editor of ''Sports Car Magazine,'' and from 1966-1977 authored and published ''Automobile Almanac.'' An avid sports fan, he ''Loved the Yankees, and never, ever gave up on the NY Giants.'' His most cherished times were spent with his children on Fire Island, fishing, swimming and glassing. Family and his many friends will miss his unending quest for knowledge, enthusiasm, energy, and charm. Memorial services are planned for Sunday, February 12th. Family and friends may contact 617.308.6441.
