        SCHNOLL--Ida. 98. May 20, 2003 peacefully at home in Teaneck, NJ. Beloved mother of Eleanor Ellis and the late Bernard Schnoll, loving grandmother and greatgrandmother. Cherished by the many family and friends she loved so much. Her love was returned in abundance as she taught us to never underestimate the importance of family. >>AD#
