        LEWITT--Sol, with great sorrow we mourn the death of Sol Lewitt, a remarkable artist, whose work and humanity enhanced our perception and our lives. We were privileged to have known him and to have published his prints. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Carol, his daughters, Sofia and Eva, and his very close associates Susanna Singer and Jo Watanabe. Richard Solomon, and the staff of Pace Prints.
