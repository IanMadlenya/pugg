        $(6$)KAUFMAN--Edward G. It is with sadness that the students, faculty, staff and alumni of the NYU College of Dentistry announce the passing of Dr. Edward G. Kaufman, Dean Emeritus of the College. Dr. Kaufman served as dean from 1985 to 1998. He was associated with NYUCD as a student, faculty member and administrator for over 50 years. As dean of the nation's largest dental school, Dr. Kaufman proved himself an innovator during a decade when a significant number of other dental schools were closing their doors. He improved NYUCD's facilities; increased the College's endowment and research grants; and enacted numerous community outreach programs to help the less fortunate. In his more than half a century of service to NYUCD, Dr. Kaufman introduced major curriculum initiatives in the basic and clinical sciences, including a comprehensive care approach to dental education, business-management training, and computer-assisted learning for students. He increased the number of women and minority students on campus, and dramatically expanded the College's international studies programs. Dr. Kaufman was consistently guided by a commitment to clinical excellence, improved access to care for New York's poor, and increased resources for dental education. We offer sincere condolences to his family. Michael C. Alfano Dean, New York University College of Dentistry
