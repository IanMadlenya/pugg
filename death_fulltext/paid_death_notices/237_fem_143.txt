        TUCKER--Marcia. The trustees and staff of the New Museum are deeply saddened by the loss of Founding Director Marcia Tucker. An extraordinary visionary, Marcia was only 37 years old when she created the New Museum. Her courage, passion, tenacity and charisma, in addition to her unwavering committment to art and ideas, propelled the institution forward. She was widely admired and will be remembered as a compassionate and brilliant curator, director, author, performer, agitator, teacher, wife, mother and friend. Though she is gone, her spirit will endure through her legacy of remarkable achievements and the profound influence she had on the many people she touched. We extend our deepest sympathies to her husband Dean McNeil and her daugher Ruby, whom she loved so much. Saul Dennison, President Board of Trustees Lisa Phillips, Henry Luce III Director
