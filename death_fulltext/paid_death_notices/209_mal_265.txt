        STEPANEK -- Matthew J.T. 1990-2004. With deepest sorrow we mourn the loss of this extraordinary young poet, peacemaker and MDA National Goodwill Ambassador. We extend our love and compassion to his mother, Jeni Stepanek, who's lost her four children to mitochondrial myopathy. In his 13 years, Mattie made an unforgettable impact on millions. His incredible grace and courage in the face of his disease inspire our continuing commitment to the defeat of devastating neuromuscular disorders.
