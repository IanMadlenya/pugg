        GUTH-Paul C. It is with great sorrow that Philip H. Isles, President, and the other Officers and Directors of the Robert Lehman Foundation Inc. note the sudden passing on May 7, 2002, of Paul C. Guth. For some of us, Paul's death marks the end of personal and professional associations dating back almost four decades. During that time, he was our friend, our colleague and our counselor, and we individually and collectively profited beyond measure from the wisdom of his counsel and the pleasure of his company and of his wit. We shall not see his like again. Our thoughts and hearts go out in grief to his widow, Joan; his brother, Francis, and his other friends and clients.
        GUTH-Paul C. The partners, associates and staff of Kelley Drye & Warren LLP mourn with deep sadness the passing of our partner and dear friend. Paul's professional and personal contributions to the Firm are invaluable, and will continue to be felt for years to come. Both the Firm, and its clients, are indeed fortunate to have benefited from his counsel. We will sorely miss him and extend our deepest sympathy to Joan and the other members of Paul's family.
