        BRAIGER-Armand Justin. Noury Goujjane, proprietor of One If By Land, Two If By Sea, announces the passing of the co-owner and founder of the restaurant, Armand Justin Braiger, eternally 39, in Florida, on August 20, 1999. The restaurant staff joins Mr. Goujjane in extending deepest sympathy to Armand's sisters, Adele Wooters and Leonore R. Spinell; and his many nieces and nephews. We will miss his grace, charm, wit, generosity of spirit and wisdom. Mr. Goujjane remains committed to continuing to implement the plans he and Mr. Braiger developed over most of the past decade for the restaurant.
