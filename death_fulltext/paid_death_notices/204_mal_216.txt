        WEINER--Irving H. June 7, 1910-January 11, 2004. Dearly beloved soulmate and friend, husband, father, uncle, grandfather, great grandfather, ''Gramps''. Both his laughter and ethics will echo in our ears and his love for us and our love for him will be eternal. A self made accomplished NYU graduate; his accounting ethics are unmatched. No deduction in love or money taken for granted. Donations in his honor may be sent to B'nai B'rith or NYU Stern School of Business.
