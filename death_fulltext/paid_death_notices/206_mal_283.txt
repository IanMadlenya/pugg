        CASTLEBERRY -- Robert. The Carmine's family mourns the passing of our beloved Beverage Director, Robert Castleberry on March 16th. Robert was a lover of life and had an intense passion for people, wine and food. His palate was considered to be one of the most discriminating in the New York wine industry and he was only two stages from passing his final examinations for his master of wine degree. A teacher as well as a student, Robert trained Carmine's staff in wine knowledge, in salesmanship and also gave frequent wine classes at the 92nd St Y. His integrity, loyalty and dedication to Carmine's has enriched the souls and filled the hearts of us all.
