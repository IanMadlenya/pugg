        NILSSON--Birgit. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of Birgit Nilsson, one of the greatest sopranos ever to sing on our stage. As Brnnhilde in Wagner's ''Ring'' cycle, she reigned supreme for many years, and the power and beauty of her voice also made her ideal for many of the leading roles of Wagner, Richard Strauss, Verdi, and Puccini. No one who heard her as Elektra, Turandot, or Isolde is likely to forget the apparent ease with which she surmounted the notorious difficulties of these parts. In the 22 years she sang complete operas at the Met, Nilsson appeared in 16 roles and, in her entire Met career, 223 performances. From her sensational Met debut as Isolde on December 18, 1959 to the last Valkyrie cry that she tossed off as part of a tribute to James Levine at his 25th Anniversary gala in 1996, the public reaction to her phenomenal gifts was tumultuous acclaim. Both in front of the curtain and behind it, she was beloved as much for her sparkling personality and dry sense of humor as for her artistry. Thank you, dear Birgit, for the years of extraordinary performances and joy you brought to so many. We send our heartfelt condolences to her husband, Bertil, and all her family and friends.
