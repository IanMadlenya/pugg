        WILBUR--Brayton Jr. The Board of Trustees and staff of The Asia Foundation extend our condolences to the Wilbur family on the loss of Brayton Wilbur Jr. The Foundation is grateful for Mr. Wilbur's long-term friendship and support further exemplifying the legacy of his father Brayton Wilbur Sr, founding member of The Asia Foundation in 1954. His commitment to a peaceful and prosperous Asia is underscored by his active involvement on the Foundation's Board, on which he first became a member in 1972. As one of the longest serving members of the Foundation's Board, Mr. Wilbur was an invaluable leader as Chairman of the Board from 1991 to 1995. His leadership and unique insight will be missed. The Asia Foundation, 465 California St, 9th Fl, San Francisco, CA 94104.
