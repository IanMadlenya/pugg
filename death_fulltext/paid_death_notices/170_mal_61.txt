        JOFRE-Ernesto. UNITE mourns the untimely passing of an important leader of our union on March 5. Manager of the Amalgamated Northeast Joint Board and recently elected an International Vice President, Ernesto was an organizer, a political activist, a trade unionist of high principle and commitment. His work as a trade union leader and political activist in Chile resulted in a three year imprisonment after the 1973 coup. His death is a loss to the labor movement and to progressive politicals here and in his native Chile. Deepest sympathies to his wife, Beatrice, his six children and ten grandchildren. Services will be private. A memorial service will be held at 2 PM on Sunday, March 11 at the New York Joint Board, 31 West 15th Street, New York City. Jay Mazur, President Bruce Raynor, Secretary-Treasurer Edgar Romney and Ed Clark, Executive Vice Presidents
