        KLEMPERER-Peter. Colleagues from the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation will always remember and miss Peter Klemperer-a much-valued guide and friend. Peter brought a broad range of knowledge and a unique vision to the Corporation for more than a quarter-century. Peter's thinking and deep concern for the health of all New Yorkers influenced reimbursement policy and legislation throughout New York State. Those who worked with Peter found, in this forthright and honest man, the extraordinary combination of superior analytic thinking and love for ideas. He always demonstrated genuine appreciation, curiosity and generosity toward other people. The Corporation will miss his leadership, strategic thinking and dedication, as well as his warmth, humor, compassion and sensitivity. We wish to extend our heartfelt sympathies to Judy, Jerusha and Ethan, who have lost a loving husband and father. We share in your tremendous loss.
