        MacRAE-Cameron F. LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae mourns with profound sorrow the death of our founding and name partner on May 29 in Hobe Sound, Florida. He was Senior Partner and Chairman of LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae for many years, and set the mold for the national and international growth of the Firm. During the Second World War, Mr. MacRae served as Assistant Director of the Readjustment Division of the War Department, while on active duty as a Colonel in the Army. He also served as President of the Federal Energy Bar Association from 1969-1970, and served as a consultant to the Task Force on Water Resources and Power of the Hoover Commission from 1953-1955. He will be sorely missed, and we extend our deepest sympathy to all members of his bereaved family. Funeral services will be private.
