        LERNER-Al. The Officers, Trustess and members of The Forest Hills Jewish Center mourn the loss of Al Lerner who has, with his beloved wife Norma, been a most gracious and generous supporter of our synagogue. Our hearts go out to Norma and her family at this painful time. May they find comfort in the remarkable legacy of family and community that Al has left to us all. Rabbi Gerald C.
