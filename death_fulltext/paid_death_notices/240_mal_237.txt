        LEWIS--Everett E., died on January 12th. A lifelong New Yorker, Everett was born on August 12, 1924 and attended DeWitt Clinton High School. He enlisted in the Army Air Corps in 1942 and served in the Pacific. After the war, he completed his CCNY degree and went on to NYU Law School. He spent his professional life, which continued until his death, fighting for working men and women as a union lawyer. He was a partner at Lewis, Clifton and Nikolaidis at his death and was a legendary figure in the labor law fraternity. Everett led a life full of passion and purpose. He was a committed Democrat and progressive. He had a long and devoted marriage to Liz Lewis until her death in 1994. He had a loving and supporting relationship with his companion, Shirley Fingerhood. He was intensely involved in the raising and careers of his children, Nick Lewis, Sally Lewis Fine, Claudia Lehr and Norah Kamya and was a model grandfather to Alex, Jamie, Hannah, Clarence, Ned, Jane, Jake, Sam, Sarah and Elizabeth. He held his friends close to his heart and often acted on his belief that he had a duty to help others. A list of those who mourn his passing would be too lengthy to list. A Memorial Service will be held at the Society for Ethical Culture (2 West 64th Street) at 2:00 PM on February 3rd (to allow friends to join the Iraq War protests on January 27th). In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to The Makula Fund for Children, (www.makulafund.org).
