        MESSERSCHMITT -- John. The College of Aeronautics Board of Trustees on behalf of the students, faculty and staff, is deeply saddened by the loss of John Messerschmitt who dedicated more than 18 years to the College. He was steadfastly committed to higher education and served as Chair of the Board for seven years. Under his leadership, the College revised the degree offerings, completed a major construction project, and laid the foundation for the next 100 years for our leading-edge institution. His service to our country as a World War II combat pilot and lifetime dedication to the field of electronics contributed to his thoughtful insight on the Board, and he will be missed. The College community also extends its condolences and heartfelt support to Mrs. Betsy Messerschmitt and family.
