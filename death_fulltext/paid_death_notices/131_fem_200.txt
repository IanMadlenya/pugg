        LAUMONT-Sophie. As we sit here and listen to one of your famous mixes, we find it impossible to describe to the world the wonderful person that you are. We will miss and always remember you for your sense of humor, wisdom, strength, beauty and your love of life. Now you can relax, eat your Teuschers, watch ''E.R.,'' and read your yearbook notes. Your med. students will miss you, but not as much as we will. We will hold you in our hearts forever. Love, Your Friends.
