        GOLDENSTEIN--Murray. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) and its Women's Division mourn the loss of Murray Goldenstein of New York City. Following the lead of his beloved late wife Rose, he became a devoted supporter of the ATS Women's Division, reaching the level of Technion Guardian, representing the highest commitment to the ATS, the Technion and Israel. He also served on the ATS Board of Regents. His generous support of numerous Women's Division (WD) projects includes the Rose Goldenstein Memorial Scholarship Fund, WD Priority Scholarship Fund, and a variety of WD Medical Engineering Projects. In recognition of his outstanding support for and frequent hosting of Technion students, the annual Women's Division student-anddean luncheon was renamed in his honor. We extend our condolences to his step grandchildren Adam, Seth and Katie Yanow, and the entire Goldenstein and Yanow families. American Society for Technion-Israel Institute of Technology Stephen A.

Lyons, Women's Division Chair, Gloria Neimark, Women's Leadership Director
