        OTHMER-Mildred Topp. The Board of Trustees, President David C. Chang, Chancellor George Bugliarello and the entire Polytechnic University community mourn the passing of Mildred Topp Othmer, beloved wife of the late Dr. Donald F. Othmer, after a long illness. Dr. Othmer, who passed away in 1995, was a longtime Polytechnic faculty member, co-author of the landmark KirkOthmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology and one of the nation's most influential and inventive chemical engineers. Mrs. Othmer, a member of the prominent Topp family of Omaha, NE, attended the University of Nebraska in the years when relatively few women earned four-year college degrees. After graduation, she taught English, economics and foreign languages in the Midwest before becoming a successful fashion buyer for her family's clothing outlet. Her flair for fashion and her skill in marketing helped turn the business into one of the region's most exclusive and fashionable women's clothing stores. Several years later, Mrs. Othmer struck new educational ground again when she came to New York and earned an MBA from Columbia University. Her marriage to Dr. Othmer in 1950 opened a new chapter in a life already marked by a spirit of adventure and accomplishment. She was her husband's friend and inspiration and constant traveling companion, accompanying him on numerous worldwide trips to locales as far away as Southeast Asia and South America. She also devoted many hours as an education consultant and community volunteer. She and Dr. Othmer were generous benefactors of Polytechnic University, and their names grace the libraries or buildings of the Brooklyn History Museum, the Long Island College Hospital, in Brooklyn, the American Chemical Society, in Washington, D.C., and the Chemical Heritage Foundation, in Philadelphia, PA. The entire University family extends its heartfelt condolences to the Othmer family.
