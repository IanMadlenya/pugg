        O'SULLIVAN-Timothy F. The Board of Trustees and the Staff of the Cultural Institutions Retirement System deeply mourn the loss of a great friend and a wonderful colleague who was taken from us at the World Trade Center on September 11. Tim was the long-serving representative to CIRS from the Wildlife Conservation Society and since his retirement in 1997, he has remained active as a consultant to our Board. Tim's wisdom and vast knowledge of New York's cultural institutions, his marvelous sense of humor and his strong belief in the CIRS plans are an inspiration to all of us. Tim's proudest accomplishment was the role he played in bringing financial security to thousands of Cultural Institution and Daycare employees. Tim was an example to us all and his light will shine on us forever. He will be missed by all of us and we extend our deepest sympathy to his family. William E. Havemeyer, Chair Robert M. Fox, Exec. Director Raymond Miller, Assoc. Director
