        STONE-Peter. The Dramatists Guild of America mourns the loss of its longtime leader Peter Stone. During his unprecedented 18 year term as President, Peter fought tirelessly to defend the rights and interests of Americas playwrights, composers and lyricists, and did so with passion, intelligence and an unfailing wit. Our sympathies go out to his wife Mary. He was a singular force in the theater and in our our lives. We will not see his like again. The Dramatists Guild of America
