        PICARD--Matthew. Left us Sunday after a lifetime of love and dedication to his family, community and legal profession. Devoted to his beloved wife Phyllis of almost half a century; his children Holly and Ken and his twin sister Lita Katz. Matty was a paragon of strength, honesty and integrity who will be missed by the many who knew him, loved him and respected him. Services today 12 noon at Gutterman's, 8000 Jericho Turnpike, Woodbury, L.I. Donations may be made to North Shore Synagogue or the charitable organization of your choice.
