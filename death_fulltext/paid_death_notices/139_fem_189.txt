        LOVELL-Agnes Keen. Mercifully, at home in Meadow Lakes, Hightstown, NJ on August 27, 1998. Faithful wife of Robert M. Lovell, died 1988 and loving mother of Robert, Jr. of New Vernon and Douglas K. of Randolph, six grandchildren and four great grandchildren. She was born Sept. 29, 1909 to Howard Keen and Fanny Whipple in Jersey City, graduated State Teachers College in Trenton, and after her marriage in 1929 served as President of Glen Ridge Auxiliary, honored volunteer for USO, Salvation Army and Covenant House in Ft. Lauderdale, FL. She reveled in her music, clowning and travel. A memorial service at Glen Ridge Congregational Church will be announced later. In lieu of flowers, make contritibutions in her name to your chosen charity.
