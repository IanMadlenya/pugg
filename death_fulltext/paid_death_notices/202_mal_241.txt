        CHANANAU--Alexander. On November 22, 2003 at the age of 88. His wife Adele of 65 years of marriage, his daughter Rosalind, granddaughters Sarah & Allison, his son-inlaw Gary Karlitz and his four step-grandchildren, remember him lovingly. Born in New York City in 1915, he worked his way through college and law school ultimately serving as a Justice of the Supreme Court of New York from 1974 through 1983 and previously as a member of the New York State legislature from 1958 through 1972. Alexander Chananau will be remembered as a selfless public servant who took pride in helping others. During his long and distinguished career, Judge Chananau had served as a director for many organizations including: Supreme Court Justices Association of the City of New York, Bronx County Bar Association, New York State Trial Lawyers Association and the New York University Law School Alumni Association among others. The family will sit Shiva at the Chananau home from Tuesday through Sunday morning. An extraordinary man, he will be sorely missed.
