        GASPARINETTI-Luigi. The Board of Directors of Career Transition For Dancers, and the dancers it serves, nationwide, mourn the immense loss of our dear friend, mentor, & fellow board member. Luigi was respected for his dedicated, personal service to CTFD's board, and beloved for his warmth, his insight, and delightful sense of joie de vivre. As a former dancer who loved dance and dancers, & understood the issues they faced making career transitions, he was inspired to establish the Luigi Gasparinetti Scholarship Program For Graduate Studies for their benefit. Luigi's selfless devotion to CTFD's mission can never be duplicated or replaced. Cynthia G. Fischer, President
