        GASS--Dr. J. Donald. The Macula Foundation, Inc. mourns the passing of an esteemed colleague and friend, Dr. J. Donald Gass. During his illustrious career, Don made numerous clinical and scientific contributions making him one of the most respected experts on diseases of the retina and macula. His career resulted in many honors and awards of merit, including the establishment of the Gass Medal given for outstanding contributions to macular diseases by the prestigious Macula Society; he was the first recipient in 1987. To his patients, he was an extraordinary healer and restorer of sight; to his students, he was a teacher with wisdom, wit and warmth; and to his colleagues, he was a master of original and innovative thinking -a leader who helped shape the specialty of retinal diseases. He was the ultimate scholar and motivator whose work will be a source of inspiration in perpetuity. He is survived by his wife, MargyAnn, their four children and their grandchildren. Dr. Lawrence A.
