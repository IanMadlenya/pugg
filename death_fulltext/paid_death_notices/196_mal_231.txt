        GOTTLIEB--Martin. The Officers and Directors of Green Bus lines, Triboro Coach, Jamaica Buses and Command Bus Company sadly note the passing of Martin Gottlieb, a man who rose from bus driver to executive and later a respected member of the Board of Directors. Hard working, industrious and capable, but above all a good friend. His able guidance will be missed. Our condolences to his wife Eileen, his children Stacey Stone, Karen and Steven Bodnar, and his grandchildren Alex and Joshua Stone and Andrew Bodnar. Jerry Cooper, Chairman Board of Directors >>AD#
