        TRILLIN-Alice. The Department of Pediatrics at Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center deeply mourns the death of Alice Trillin, a constant friend and supporter of our patients and their families. Alice had survived cancer early in her life and, through talks and lectures to children and students of medicine, articulated with uniquely clear images, the spector of cancer after treatment, the sleeping dragon subdued but always to be watched. She devoted her energies to kids with cancer, developing a national communications system for children and their parents to provide information, news about treatment, encouragement, the tools to help quell the dragon and return to normal life. She accomplished much. We shall miss her deeply. Richard J. O'Reilly, MD, Chairman Dept. of Pediatrics
