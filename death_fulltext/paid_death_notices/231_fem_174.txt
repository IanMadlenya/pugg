        CORREA--Vanessa. The trustees and staff of the 1199SEIU Benefit and Pension Funds mourn the sudden loss of our dear friend and colleague Vanessa Correa. Vanessa was the Assistant to the Executive Director. Vanessa worked at the Funds for over nine years and was deeply committed to helping and serving our members, New York's healthcare workers. We will miss her infectious enthusiasm and generous spirit. We offer our deepest sympathy to Mary, Carlos, and the Correa family.
