        TANNERT-Charles W. A devoted husband, loving father and grandfather, and avid fisherman, Charlie passed quietly on the morning of March 12, 1998 at the age of fifty-nine. His wry wit, quiet nature, and strong character will be sorely missed by all that knew and loved him, especially his wife, Noreen, and two children, Lisa and Chuck. Charlie is also survived by his son-in-law, John, and three adorable grand kids, Ben, Nick, and Sam. No matter how hectic life got around him, Charlie always found solace out on the water aboard his 18-foot runabout. With a fishing rod in hand and the sun on his face, Charlie always said, ''I love to go fishing. Catching something is just a bonus.'' I'll always treasure our Alaskan adventure, my friend. We'll see you on the other side. Reposing at Austin F. Knowles, Inc. Funeral Home, 128 Main Street, Port Washington. Visiting hours on Saturday and Sunday 2-4 and 7-9PM. Mass Monday 9:30AM, St. Peter of Alcantara Church. Interment Private.
