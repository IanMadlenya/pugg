        MILLS-Nina. Born December 2, 1950, died December 28, 2000 in Berkeley, CA. After a long and courageous fight with cancer, she left us too early. Writing, playing music, reading, hiking, traveling, sharing-a life filled with many passions ended too soon. Lovingly and fondly remembering the good years. Michael, Peter, Pumpkin
