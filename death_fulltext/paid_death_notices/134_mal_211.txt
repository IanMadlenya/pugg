        GOTTDIENER-Arthur, Ph.D. The Institute for Contemporary Psychotherapy notes with great sadness the passing of a much esteemed training and supervising analyst. Dr. Gottdiener was a revered supervisor who imparted his skill and knowledge to many students. His perceptiveness and wit will be sorely missed. Our heartfelt condolences to his family.
