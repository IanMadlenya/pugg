        BERND--Walter E., Jr. Age 89. Of Long Island City and Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. Beloved husband of the late Jessica, of Long Island City. Loving father of Jessica and Walter. Adored grandfather to Sean, David and Chris. All around hot-shot to those lives he touched. He worked hard at being a curmudgeon, and was usually successful in his efforts. Yet, underneath an outwardly gruff (and challenging) exterior lay a heart of gold, willing hand and a proud father. He loved philosophical and political discussions, and contributed generously to people's lives and worthy causes. He is sorely missed. Contributions please to: Dawn Farm, 502 W. Huron St., Ann Arbor, MI. 48104, Center for Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation.
