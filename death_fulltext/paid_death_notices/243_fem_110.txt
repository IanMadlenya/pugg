        CECALA--Mary, passed away peacefully in her sleep on April 18th at the Mary Manning Walsh Home at age 90. She leaves to mourn her loss a loving son Joseph and wife Kathleen, five grandchildren and their spouses, Joseph, Jr., Kristen and Jason, Patrick, Benny and Danielle and Joey and Alexandra and five great-grandchildren Lana, Patty, Benny, Anna and Jesse. She was a grand dame loved by all and with a sense of humor that made us all laugh. Her oldest nephew, Jim, said it best with a quote from Louis Nizer: ''A beautiful lady is an accident of nature. A beautiful old lady is a work of art.'' Mom was both. She now joins her husband Benedetto and son Patrick. She will lie in repose at Frank E. Campbell Home, Madison Avenue at 81st Street, New York from 2pm4pm and 7pm-9pm on Thursday and Friday April 19th and 20th. In lieu of flowers this family requests that donations be made to The Carmelite Sisters for the Aged c/o Mary Manning Walsh Home 1339 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021. Funeral services will be held at 10am Saturday April 21st at St. Paul the Apostle Church, 9th Avenue at 60th Street, Manhattan.
