        CARRIG-Randy. The Board of Directors, staff and artists of The Manhattan Theatre Club are profoundly saddened by the passing of their colleague and dear friend, Randy Carrig. Randy Carrig worked in The Manhattan Theatre Club's casting department for eleven years, and as casting director, he cast Manhattan Theatre Club's ''Love! Valor! Compassion!'' by Terrence McNally, among others. His courageous spirit, good humor and strong commitment were an inspiration to all who knew him. To his parents and family, and long time companion Peter Straus, we extend our deepest condolences.
