        WOLKE-Marshall. The World Council of Masorti/Conservative Synagogues mourns the passing of our past president, Marshall Wolke. During his administration he was able to lay the foundation for our global outreach programs. May his luminous memory be a constant blessing to the entire community of Israel.
