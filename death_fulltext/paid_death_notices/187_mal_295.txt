        AUSTIN-Stephen G. The attorneys and staff of Fulbright & Jaworski L.L.P. mourn the passing of our colleague, Stephen G. Austin, on August 26, after a brief illness. Steve's deep knowledge of the law and his enthusiasm for the practice of law were an inspiration to many of us. Prior to joining the firm in 1997, he was a partner at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft and Hill Betts & Nash. We extend our deepest sympathies to his children, former wife and family, as well as to his many colleagues and friends in the legal and business community. A service will be held at the Hillsborough Funeral Home, 796 Rt. 206, Hillsborough, NJ, on Friday, August 30, 2002, at 4 PM. Visitation hours are from 3:00-4:00 PM and 7:00-9:00 PM.
