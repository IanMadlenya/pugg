        CAHILL--Gerald H., 67. Died peacefully at home on May 14, 2006. Beloved father of Caitlin, Bevin, Gerry and Lizzie, proud grandfather of Charlotte, and one-of-a-kind brother, uncle, cousin, and friend. He is survived by his siblings, John, Kevin, Michael, Patricia Fay, Moreen Carey, and Cathleen Driscoll, and his dear friend, Joan Gurry. Wherever he is now, he is making people laugh.
