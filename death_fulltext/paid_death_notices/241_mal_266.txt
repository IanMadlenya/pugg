        BORG--Neil A. Beloved son of Robert F. Borg and E. Winifred Borg, caring brother to Christina, Lisa, Kiri and his twin Dean. He passed peacefully at his home in Manhattan. Born December 24, 1961, he grew up and attended school in Scarsdale, NY. We will forever admire his individual style, kind and generous heart and infectious sense of humor. His knowledge, passion and appreciation of music, animals and literature was evident to all who knew him. His towering physical presence and booming baritone voice combined with a warm and sincere demeanor created a wonderful and positive contradiction. To his two nieces and five nephews, Uncle Neil's useful enthusiasm and approachable warm nature will be greatly missed. Family and close friends will attend a service at Riverside Memorial Chapel, West 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue in Manhattan, Wednesday February 21 at 11 am. He will be loved and missed by his family forever.
