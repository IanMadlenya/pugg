        MADOFF--Roger. On your birthday I thank you for your gift. You graced us with your presence on this earth for only a short time, but that time was filled with love, laughter, sincerity, integrity and honor. My beloved brother, you always understood me and cared for me like no one could. You brightened my world with your incredible sense of humor and wit. Rebecca will never forget all the lessons she learned from her Uncle Roger. She loves you as I do with all her heart. We will miss you, think of you everyday, and smile when we speak your name. Happy Birthday. Your Devoted Sister and Niece and Goddaughter, Shana and Rebecca
