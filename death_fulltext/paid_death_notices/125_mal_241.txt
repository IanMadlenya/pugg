        CUTLER-Arthur J. It is with profound sorrow that the partners of Jeff Gural mourn the untimely passing of his close, personal friend and soul-mate ''Artie'', a compassionate and devoted friend, restauranteur extraordinaire, avid horse player and all around great guy. Our hearts ache with sympathy for his wife Alice and his daughters Jody and Danielle. He will live on in our hearts forever. Newmark & Company Real Estate Inc.
