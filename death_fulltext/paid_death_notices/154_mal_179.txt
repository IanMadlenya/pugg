        GEE-Timothy S., Dr., The Leukemia Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center deeply regrets the passing of our dear friend and colleague, Dr. Timothy S. Gee. A distinguished clinician, academician, and valued member of our group for more than 25 years, Dr. Gee trained numerous young physicians in our Fellowship Program. He was an exemplary role model: a fervent advocate for excellence in patient care, devoted to the compassionate treatment of patients and their families, and a pioneer in patient education. He was a much respected colleague and mentor to all involved in the treatment of leukemia. His presence within our medical community will be sorely missed. We extend our deepest condolences to Carol, Vicky, Matthew, Christopher and Stephanie. Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
