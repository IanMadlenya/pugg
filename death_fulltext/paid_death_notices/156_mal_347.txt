        CLAIBORNE-Craig. The Trustees, Faculty, Staff, and Students of the Culinary Institute of America mourn the death of Craig Claiborne, standard-bearer and consummate food writer. Mr. Claiborne's history with the CIA spans almost forty years, including dedicated service as a member of the corporation since 1978. Mr. Claiborne is one of ten individuals in the CIA's ''Hall of Fame''. His memory will live on at the CIA with our Craig Claiborne Bookstore and Hospitality Center, as well as in the Craig Claiborne Collection at the College's Conrad N. Hilton Library. Future CIA students will continue to benefit from the Craig Claiborne Scholarships. Our deepest sympathies are extended to his family, friends, and colleagues.
