        SILVER-Martha (Rubin). Of Belle Harbor, NY, died on June 11th, 2002. Beloved, devoted wife of the late Louis Silver. Loving, cherished mother of Stanley, Phyllis (Gerald Gelles), Robert and Martin (Dale). Adored, loving grandma Martha of David & Robin, Stuart & Carol, Steven & Caron, Richard, Denise & Julian, Clifford, Enid, Wendy & Jordan and Laurie. Beloved great-grandma of Alisha, Stefanie & Matthew, Joshua, Rachel & Dana, Noah & Grant, Samantha and Carli. She leaves her dear sister Sunny Rosenberg and many devoted nieces and nephews. Philanthropy was part of her life, together with her husband Louis, they gave generously of their financial means, and their time and efforts to many causes, both here and abroad, Jewish and secular, including The Martha and Louis Silver Day Training Center at AHRC in Brookville, LI; Peninsula Hospital, Far Rockaway, NY; Kingsbrook Medical Center, Brooklyn; Boys Town of Jerusalem; UJA; Jewish Theological Seminary of America; National Holocaust Museum, Washington, DC. Staunch supporters of Israel Bonds from its inception, she was a delegate on the first Women's Delegation to Israel in 1952 and was a dedicated member of Temple Beth El, Rockaway Park, for over 70 years. These and many more benefited from their humanitarian efforts. Her wise counsel, witty ''grandma Martharisms,'' warm smile and loving kindness to her family and friends will always be remembered by all who loved, admired and respected her. A wonderful example of a true matriarch and an Aishes Chayil. We shall miss you. You will live in our hearts forever. Funeral services today, June 13, 2002 at 1 PM, Mt. Lebanon Cemetery, Queens.
