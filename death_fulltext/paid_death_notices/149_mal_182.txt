        DWORKIN-Leonard, in loving tribute. To Lenny who made his transition on June 5, 1998. Born in the Bronx, at 10 he established a legendary basement workshop where he created ingenious objects. Inventing in the tradition of bricolage, Lenny built the first strobe lights for entertainment use. Educated at City College and NYU Graduate School of Psychology, Lenny brought wit, humor, and joy to many. Your friends.
