        DANSKER--Jerome. Gold berg Weprin & Ustin LLP mourns the passing of our friend and client, and the dean of New York's real estate community, Jerome Dansker. Jerry was a selfmade man, rising from real estate holdings and a lending business to Chairman of the highly successful Intervest National Bank. Jerry's vision was and is an instrumental part of the vibrant real estate market. A call to Jerry often presaged the signing of a contract. Jerry's word was his bond. Integrity was his code. Many of Jerry's achievements were public, but his highest achievement and reason for living was his family - his wife, Jean, his children, and his grandchildren, to whom he was totally devoted, and to whom we extend our heartfelt condolences.
        $(6$)DANSKER--Jerome, on August 9, 2006. Devoted husband of Jean (Kandell). Loving father of Helene Bergman, Neil and Lowell. Dear Fatherin-law of Barbara and Larry Bergman. Adoring grandfather of Jennifer, Allison, Andrew, Lisa, Tracy and Rachel. Brother of Norman and Penny Gordon. Service Friday 11:15am at ''The Riverside'', 76 Street & Amsterdam Avenue.
