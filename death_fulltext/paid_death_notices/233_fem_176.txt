        MINTON - Susann. Artist, passed on Tuesday, June 27 in Manhattan after a brief illness. A Park Slope resident for 26 years, Susann was the daughter of the late Commander Hal Minton, U.S.N. and Gaynell Minton. Her early years as a Navy brat included life in the Dominican Republic and Hawaii, places that would forever feed her appetite for color, fantasy and play. Her love of the arts, especially drawing and painting, came early and remained constant. From undergraduate studies in art at the University of Georgia in Athens, GA, to receiving her M.F.A. at Pratt, art nourished her. A beautiful woman with a quick smile, Susann led her life like she painted: she was vivid, bold, funny, tough, loyal, tolerant and jaunty when in her cups. It was NYC that captured her heart, its galleries and museums feeding her passion and knowledge of the creative force. But it was Brooklyn, specifically Park Slope, that fed and nurtured her soul. It is where she met her husband, photographer Craig Blankenhorn, her true love and partner in life. Along with her husband and her mother, Susann is survived by her brother Stanley of Palm Harbor, FL, and niece Kellie and nephew Ryan. A memorial service will be held Saturday, July 1, 2006, 10:45 A.M. at Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn, NY.
