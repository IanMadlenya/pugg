His life's companion, Elmer Gross, died one year ago and so he leaves behind friends including the many people who used to visit him at the WEG Gallery for his endless good humor, his warmth, his open smile and his gentle enthusiasm. A memorial mass will be held at St. Thomas More on 89th Street, Saturday, Jan. 31, 9:45AM
