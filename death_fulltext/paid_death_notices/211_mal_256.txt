        SPARBER--Norman H. The partners and staff of Brauner Baron Rosenzweig & Klein, LLP mourn the loss of our dear friend and retired partner Norman H. Sparber, who served for more than 50 years as a partner and of counsel to our firm. He addressed legal problems with intelligence and diligence and earned the respect of his colleagues and clients. Even after his formal retirement, he remained actively engaged in the activities of the firm and the needs of his clients. We will miss his wise counsel and acerbic wit, and extend our deepest condolences to his children Merryl and Roy, his daughter-in-law Susan, his grandchildren and great grandchildren.
