        BARZELAY -- Batya. The Board of Directors and staff of the JCC on the Palisades mourn the loss of Batya Barzelay, who has been a loved and creative staff member of the JCC. Her devotion to our Senior Adult Department made our center a ''home away from home'' for hundreds of seniors, and under her leadership, the JCC Israeli Club flourished. We send our sincerest condolences to her devoted husband Avraham, her sons Ami and Ifar, her daughter-in-law Alix, and her beloved grandson Wiley. She was deeply loved and treasured by the JCC family. May her memory be for a blessing. Daniel Rubin, President Avi A. Lewinson, Exec. Dir.
