        SIMON--Sybil C. Passed away May 14, 2006. My strongest admirer, my toughest critic. My favorite Scrabble player. My mother, my friend. Judi McLaughlin
        $(6$)SIMON--Sybil C. was extraordinarily supportive of the New York Youth Symphony as a member of the Board since 1988. Her spirit was always positive and optimistic, reflected in her encouragement of the students whom she saw as the future. Her absence will be hugely felt, but even more important is the legacy she has left for generations to come. Heartfelt thoughts go to her loving daughter Judith McLaughlin; Judith's husband, Dr. Gerry McLaughlin; two grandsons, Andy and Glenn Cohen and their wives Julie and Renee; and four exceptional great grandchildren. Board of Trustees New York Youth Symphony Leslie J. Garfield, Chair Robert L. Poster, Vice Chair A. Slade Mills, Jr., Pres Barry Goldberg, Exec. Dir.
        $(6$)SIMON--Sybil. The Arts & Business Council of Americans for the Arts mourns the passing of Sybil Simon, the founding Executive Director of the Arts & Business Council. In 1965, she had the vision to help a group of business leaders create what grew into the Arts & Business Council, and over the next 23 years, she built it into a leading promoter of arts and business partnership. She was a pioneer, and her loss will be deeply felt.
