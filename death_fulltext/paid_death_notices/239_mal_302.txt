        SMYTH--Craig Hugh. The Institute of Fine Arts -NYU is profoundly saddened by the death of Craig Hugh Smyth at age 91. Craig served the Institute with great distinction as inspiring professor, as loyal trustee, and as visionary director from 1951 to 1973. With outstanding intellect and quiet decisiveness he built our faculty and student body. He brought the Institute to the splendid James B. Duke House, where he fostered its esprit de corps with fundamental humanity. We shall miss his elegant presence and generous friendship, and the unforgettable twinkle in his eyes. We extend deepest sympathy to Craig's wife Barbara, his family, and his many friends. Judy Steinhardt, Chairman of the Board Mariet Westermann, Steinhardt Director Institute of Fine Arts -NYU
