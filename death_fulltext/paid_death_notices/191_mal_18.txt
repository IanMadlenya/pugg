By the age of 16, he graduated valedictorian of DeWitt Clinton High School. Only a few years later, he obtained a JD from Brooklyn Law School and a DMD from Pittsburgh Dental School. Remarkably, he developed two successful careers, in oral maxillofacial surgery and in negligence law. He taught forensic medicine at New York University, and played a pivotal role in establishing the legal doctrine on comparative negligence. In service to his country during the Korean War, he served in the Air Force Medical Corps. Later, he was chief of oral maxillofacial surgery and legal counsel at McGuire Air Force Base. On completion of his service, he became president of the Jewish War Veterans at the Riverdale Jewish Center. His memory will be cherished by his loving wife, Marjorie, son Lewis and his wife Helaine, grandchildren Jake and Carly, son Bruce and his wife Edythe, grandchildren Alex and Miles, and son Sheldon.
