        MALLER-Jane. Her outer beauty was a reflection of the beauty inside her. Jane was such a good friend to so many people who prized her. To her family-she was a beacon of strength, love and kindness. Beloved and devoted wife of Arthur, cherished mother of Robin and Lisa, dearest sonin-law Zelik, adored grandmother to Robert, Lauren, David, Alexandra and Michael. We are all so much the better because she was a part of our lives. Shiva will be held through September 28 at 40 Barkers Point Road.
        MALLER-Jane. Her heart is still but her spirit is alive. Jane, find peace with your beloved Lisa. May Arthur, Robin, Zelik and your grandchildren find peace and comfort in your love and memory. Love always, Murray, Sandy, Rachelle, Liz Allan and Jeffrey
        MALLER-Jane. Cherished friend, you were a caring, loving, grand and beautiful lady. We are left with a lifetime of wonderful memories. Lennie Waxman, Penny and Dee Dee
