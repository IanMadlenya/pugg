        FINN-Richard B. The Japan Society notes with regret the passing of Richard Finn, a noted specialist in Japanese affairs, a retired foreign service officer, author, teacher and successful negotiator and administrator. His knowledge of Japan, its culture and its language was of great value to our country. We send his family our sincere good wishes. Amb. William Clark, Jr. President, The Japan Society
