        MICHELSON-Rabbi A. Elihu. We record with profound sadness the passing of our beloved colleague, age 90. Ordained in 1935, Rabbi Michelson served as chaplain in World War II after which he was a rabbi in Altoona, PA. He was the director of the Jewish Chaplaincy Commission from 1952 until his retirement in 1976. In 1999 he made aliyah to be with his family. We express our deepest condolences to his son, our colleague, Rabbi Aaron Michelson, and to all who were touched through his rabbinate. Rabbi Vernon H. Kurtz, Pres. Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Exec. VP The Rabbinical Assembly
