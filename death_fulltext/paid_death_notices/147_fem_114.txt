        LOPATE-Frances. Died Saturday, April 17, 1999, at 6:45 P.M., of a massive heart attack at age 81. Beloved mother, actress, and in all respects a trouper. Born Frances Berlow, orphaned at 11, facing hardships in her Depression youth, she was married young to Albert Lopate and raised four children, while holding a variety of jobs, including factory worker, storekeeper and textile clerk. She never gave up her dreams of show business, and at 50 began performing in cabarets, musicals, movies and TV commercials. She was Mama in the immortal Alka Seltzer ads (''Mama Mia, What a Spicey Meatball'') and a frequent Golda in touring companies of ''Fiddler on the Roof.'' She went back for a college degree in her 60's, taught children with disabilities in her 70's, and performed in a troupe for senior citizens into her 80's. Her indomitable life-force, creativity and will power inspired her four children: Leonard, a talk show host, Phillip, a writer, Bettyann, a nurse, and Joan, a teacher. Good-humored friend and surrogate mom to dozens who crossed her path, she is survived by her four children, her older sisters Gladys and Dorothy and her grandchildren Michael, Stephen and Lily. She will be intolerably missed.
