        SHEPPARD-Pamela. With profound sadness, the Board and staff of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts mourn the sudden loss of our friend and colleague, Pamela Sheppard, executive assistant to the president since 1990. She will be remembered for her kindness and her commitment to Lincoln Center, as well as her dedication and love of the perfoming arts. We extend our deepest sympathies to her son Julian and her family. Beverly Sills, Chairman Nathan Leventhal, Pres. Emeritus Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Inc.
