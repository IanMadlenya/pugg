        RECANATI-Raphael. We extend our sincerest condolences to Dina Recanati and sons, Oudi & Michael, on the loss of their beloved husband and father. Throughout his life, together with his wife Dina, Mr. Recanati was a benefactor to a myriad of organizations and institutions in the State of Israel that strengthened, educated and healed its people. We will be forever grateful for the Recanatis' vital role in providing state-of-the art technology and compassionate medical care to the people of Israel. May the warm memories of this special individual bring solace to the entire family and may they be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Amer. Comm. for Shaare Zedek Med.
