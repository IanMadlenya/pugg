        SINGER-Rabbi Yitzchok. The Board of Directors, Sisterhood and members of the Bialystoker Synagogue mourn the loss of its esteemed spiritual leader and teacher. For 41 years Moreinu Harav Singer has led our congregation and made our institution an ''anchor'' shul within the historic and vibrant Lower East Side Jewish community. Harav Singer was an outstanding teacher and a compassionate individual. His acts of charity were legendary. His passing is not only a loss for our community but also an immeasurable loss for Klal Yisroel. May his beloved Rebbetzin Bluma and his sons be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
