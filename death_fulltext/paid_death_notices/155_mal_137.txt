        TAUBE-Harry, MD. The Members of The Department of Medicine are saddened by the demise of our dear friend and colleague, Dr. Harry Taube. Dr. Taube, Professor of Clinical Medicine, has been with us for over 50 years. He was a gentle man, scholar, researcher, teacher, mentor, and model to all. In the early history of cardiac catherization, he was an active participant in pathophysiological and electrophysiological studies of the heart. His patients benefited greatly from his unusual expertise, his personal devotion to their total welfare, and his deep compassion to each individual. We will miss his amiable presence among us. To his dear spouse, Annette, and our Alumnus Dr. Oscar, Steven, and daughter, Susan T. Katchor, and his family, we offer our deep sympathy. Saul J. Farber, MD, MACP, The Frederick H. King Professor & Chairman, Dept of Medicine Director, Medical Services Bellevue and Tisch Hospitals

We will miss him. Our heartfelt sympathy is extended to Annette and the members of his family. Emily and Larry Aibel
