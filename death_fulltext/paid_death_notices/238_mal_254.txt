        GREENFIELD--Seymour. It is with a sense of deep regret that the Board of Directors of Century Tower in Fort Lee mourn the lost of ''Steve'', our past president and board member. He was a true leader: Bright, understanding, compassionate, objective and decisive, he will be sorely missed. We send our heartfelt best wishes and sympathy to his wife, Judith, and all their children and grandchildren. Board of Directors, Century Tower, Murray Altchuler, President
