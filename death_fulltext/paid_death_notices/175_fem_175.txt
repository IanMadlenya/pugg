        WIESEN-Sadonia Ecker, 86, died at her home in Flushing on 20 August. Mother, Grandmother, Friend, she left us all a legacy of love and courage, study and fortitude. Cherished wife of the late David Theodore Wiesen, she was a legal secretary for 20 years, and then a school secretary for the New York City Board of Education. She attended Queens College and the New School for Social Research. A life-long athlete, she loved to swim, play tennis, row boats, ride horses, drive cars, dance, and ''gahula.'' Her verve, vivacity, and fierce independence flourished to the end, and will remain forever with us. Blanche Wiesen Cook, Marjorie Wiesen Lessem, Clare Coss, Daniel Wayne Lessem, Doug Lessem, Richard Delewsky.
