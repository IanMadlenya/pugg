        BREITBART--Jeanne Essig, 85, of New York died peacefully at home on December 15, 2006 surrounded by family and close friends. Born February 22, 1921 in New York to Lillian Essig and Abraham Essig. After graduating high school, she began a distinguished and extraordinary career in the fashion industry: starting as a swimsuit model at 18, she ultimately worked her way up as the sole designer and V.P. for a company called Majestic Specialties, Inc. There were many awards: Lord and Taylor, 1955; Mademoiselle Magazine in 1957; and the Designer of the Year award in 1961 from Sports Illustrated. She left Majestic in 1967 to create the American marketing office for a French ready-towear firm called Vaskene et Cie. A member of The Fashion Group for ten years, she gathered many cherished friends throughout her career. Later, she achieved her B.A. from NYU in 1982 and was involved for many years as a volunteer curatorial assistant for the New Museum of Contemporary Art. She also volunteered at Community Board 2 and Independent Curators, Inc. Her family and friends will miss the love and devotion she expressed so generously, and her mean Scrabble game. She is survived by her sons, John A. Breitbart and Douglas L. Breitbart; daughter-in law, Cheryl Breitbart; nieces, Pamela Sorensen, Belinda Berse, and Gaylen Berse; and grandchildren, Nicole and Alexandre. Her family would like to express deep appreciation for the care she received over her last years from her health aids, St. Vincents Hospital and finally by the Visiting Nurse Service of NY Hospice Care. A memorial gathering is planned for Feb. 3, 2007. For information call 212-316-1654.
