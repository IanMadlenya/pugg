        SACHAROW--Lawrence. Teacher, Counsellor, Artist and Master Producer of our heralded living theatre ''The Concept'', Larry Sacharow was quintessentially our Friend. The cherished Mentor of generations of Daytop's young who drew upon his caring genius to learn the language of theatre in conveying their deep whisperings of anguish and hope! May a loving God favor his journey home! Our prayerful support of his beloved Michelle and the Family! Msgr. Wiliam B. O'Brien, President Daytop Village, Inc.
