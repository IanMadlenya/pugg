        SNYDER--Jacqueline P. August 2, 2004 in Whispering Pines, NC. Our friend Jackie had beauty, humor, and intelligence. A direct descendant of New York early Dutch settlers, New York was where her heart was. A New York debutante in 1947, in 1952 she married our late friend Ralph Snyder M.D. who later became Dean and then President of New York Medical College. Loving mother to Vicki and Gordon (Barbara) Snyder and a loving grandmother of Robert and Pamela. She was the President of the NC State Medical Auxiliary. In 1997, the Governor of North Carolina gave her an award as the Outstanding Volunteer in the State. Jackie, we loved you and Ralph and always will. Now you are as one again. Rhoda and H.G. Cohen, M.D.
