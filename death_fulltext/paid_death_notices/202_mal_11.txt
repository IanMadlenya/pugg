        GRAUBARD--Seymour, 92, died October 29 in Palm Beach of a heart attack. He had had his martini, was having dinner with his daughter and some friends, and collapsed while cheerfully discussing how to defeat President Bush. Such were his last words. A native of New York City and a graduate of Columbia College and Columbia Law School, he worked in the LaGuardia administration. After the war, he co-founded the law firm presently known as Graubard & Miller and became known for his work in international trade law. Among his many civic activities, he served as the National Chairman of the Anti-Defamation League and the President of the City Club. His wife, Blanche, died last month; he is survived by his daughter, Katherine Graubard, Professor of Biology at the University of Washington in Seattle.
        GRAUBARD--Seymour. The Anti - Defamation League mourns the passing of Seymour Graubard, ADL Honorary National Chairman. Seymour, who became involved with the League in 1936, served as ADL National Chairman from 1970 through 1976. He dedicated his life to the welfare of the Jewish people and the State of Israel. Sy worked tirelessly as an advocate for Soviet Jewry and travelled to Russia with then NYC Mayor John Lindsay, to provide support for Jewish refuseniks. He lead the fight against Arab propaganda and the Arab boycott against Israel. He was a mentor to ADL's National Directors. For more than 65 years he provided ADL with his wise counsel. He will be sorely missed. We extend our sincere condolences to his daughter Katherine and the entire family. Glen A. Tobias National Chairman Abraham H. Foxman National Director
