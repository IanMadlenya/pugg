        SHEINKMAN--Jack. The Officers and Directors of the Clothing Manufacturers Association of the USA mourn the passing of a tough but responsible and innovative union leader, and a compassionate humanitarian.

We offer deepest condolences to his loving family. Homi B. Patel, President Harvey Weinstein, Chairman Sidney Kraines, Treasurer Robert A. Kaplan, Exec. Dir. Bernard Ferster, Counsel
