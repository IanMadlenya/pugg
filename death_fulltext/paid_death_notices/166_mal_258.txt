        GREGORY-John D. The Rockefeller University mourns the loss of Dr. John D. Gregory, a dear friend and colleague. A beloved member of the University community for over fifty years, he made significant contributions to scientific understanding through his research on the structures and functions of connective tissues. Dr. Gregory will be remembered for his commitment to the University's mission of biomedical research and education. He will be greatly missed. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Polly, and their family. Arnold J. Levine, President Richard B. Fisher, Chairman David Rockefeller, Honorary Chairman
