        REISS-Margarette. In 1949, Margarette Reiss placed a notice in Newsday appealing to other parents of children with mental retardation to come together to discuss alternatives to sending their children away to institutions. A group of parents responded and met at the Carle Place Firehouse and the Association for the Help of Retarded Children Nassau County Chapter was born. Now 8,000 members strong, Nassau AHRC provides community-based opportunities and choices for over 1500 children and adults with developmental disabilities daily and is a source of guidance and support for families. Nassau AHRC extends its deepest condolences to Margarette's family. She helped lead the way in advocating for equal rights for special children. Thomas F. Moore, President Michael Mascari, Exec Director Assoc. For The Help of Retarded Children, Nassau Chapter
