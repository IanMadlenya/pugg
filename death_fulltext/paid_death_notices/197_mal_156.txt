        GREENBERG--Dr. Joseph. We have all lost a truly great man with the passing of Joe Greenberg. Joe's life and legacy defined for all of us, and so many others, what the terms ''friendship'' and ''support'' really mean. We will celebrate his life, his kind spirit, and his great accomplishments by keeping his memory close to each of us. Our deepest sympathy goes out to Joe's wife and our dearest friend, Bobbi--and to Joe's wonderful daughters Janis and Paula--and to son-in-law Marlon--and grandchildren Sloane and Noah. We love you all; and we will keep Joe's brave and beautiful legacy alive together with you forever. Alice and Berny Leyden, Harry and Laurie Gray, Bobby and Karen Gray, and Charlie, Max, Caroline and Alexander >>AD#
