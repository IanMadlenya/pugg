        SULTANOV -- Alexei. The House of Steinway & Sons notes with sadness the passing of the pianist Alexei Sultanov on June 30 in Fort Worth, Texas, at the age of 35. A Russian native, Alexei Sultanov was a valued member of our Steinway Artist family for 16 years. Brought to the spotlight by winning the 1989 Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, Mr. Sultanov was immediately recognized for his extraordinary musical gifts. His promising career was thus launched, only to be felled by a series of catastrophic strokes four years ago. Despite losing the use of his left hand, Mr. Sultanov continued to perform in the Fort Worth area, along with his wife Dace, at nursing homes and before groups of the physically challenged. His courage and determination to persevere, despite his disability, will leave a lasting legacy for many. To Dace and to his family we extend our heartfelt condolences. Bruce A.
