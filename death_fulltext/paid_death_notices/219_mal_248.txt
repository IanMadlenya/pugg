        LEEMAN--Morton H., 78, died April 21 of pulmonary fibrosis in South Paris, Maine. He was born July 13, 1926, and raised in New York City. He was the son of Irving and Estelle Lieberman Leeman. A graduate of the prestigious Townsend Harris High School, he double majored in English and Economics at NYU. He served in WWII in the Pacific. His ship, the USS Enoree, was present at the Armistice. After the War he served as Vice President at Ambassador Factors, the family business. He divided his time between NYC and Remsenberg, L.I., where he designed and built a house on the Moriches Bay. Morton lived in Harrison, ME, the last 14 years of his life, and played on a prize-winning bocci team there. He was an avid Times crossword puzzler and kept his sense of humor through the last days of his life. He is mourned by his loving family--brother Paul Leeman; children Lisa Leeman, Alison Clay-Duboff, Susanne Heim and Jonathan Leeman; grandchildren Baxter, Anna and Rosie; niece Cathy Stiers & nephew Larry Leeman; his first wife Lea Leeman, his second wife Anita Leeman--who tended to him with great devotion in the final month of his life, and longtime companion Vicki Larson. A memorial service will take place in Harrison, ME, April 24. A celebration of his life will be scheduled in New York later this year. Memorial donations may be made in his name to the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation, 1332 N. Halsted St., Ste 201, Chicago, IL. 60622.
