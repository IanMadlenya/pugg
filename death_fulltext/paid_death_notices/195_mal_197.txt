        DOUGLAS-Edward O., 76, formerly of New York City and Ghent, New York, died of heart failure on April 1 in Peterborough, New Hampshire. His ashes have been laid to rest at Deerfield Academy, his alma mater. Effy, his beloved cat and companion, predeceased him by three weeks. Of old New England stock, he sailed around the world on the square-masted brigantine Yankee in the late 1940's. While at sea, he began to nurture his lifelong love for travel and his interest in the cultures of the South Pacific and Southeast Asia. During his professional life, he worked in public relations and marketing. Building upon his mother's outstanding collection of English and early American antiques, and drawing upon his own sophisticated taste and style, he created elegant and comfortable homes throughout his life. His friends fondly remember his Dorothy Parkeresque wit, his wonderful story telling, and his urbanity.
