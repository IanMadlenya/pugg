        GREENBERG--Lenore, nee Kronenberg. 67, of New York City. Survived by her husband Paul Greenberg, son-in-law Fred Tuck, and four adoring grandchildren, Lauren 14, Amanda 12, Jake 10 and Will 5. Loving and devoted mother to the late Jill Greenberg Tuck and the late Gwen Joy Greenberg. All three tragically taken from us in an automobile accident near Akumal, Mexico on Saturday, December 20th. Lenore was a graduate of Syracuse University and City College of New York. She taught for 31 years in the Hendrick Hudson School District. She continued using her talent for teaching at the 92nd Street Y where she led computer skills classes for seniors. Lenore was an outstanding, involved lifetime member of Hadassah. She also dedicated her energy to volunteer work at the Museum of Natural History. Lenore met the love of her life, Paul Greenberg, in a fortuitous encounter at the Montauk Manor and they were married for 44 years. She bore and raised her two girls, Jill and Gwen, in Westchester County but longed for the energy and vibrancy of NYC and, children successfully launched from nest, recently moved back to NYC to a Park Avenue apartment. She was a devotee of the theatre and ballet and took full advantage of all the city had to offer. Above all, her beloved girls and grandchildren were the main focus of her busy and full life. Her multitude of friends and surviving family mourn her passing deeply. Services Friday, December 26th, 10 A.M. at Larchmont Temple, 75 Larchmont Avenue, Larchmont, NY.
