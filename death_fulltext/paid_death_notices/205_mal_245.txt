        KURTZ--Morton M., M.D. The membership of the Medical Society of the County of Queens expresses their profound sadness on the loss of their beloved colleague and friend, Morton M. Kurtz, M.D. A distinguished and dedicated physician, he served the society well for over 50 years as its president, secretary, treasurer and delegate to MSSNY House of Delegates. He also served as president of the Medical Society of the State of New York (from 1992 through 1993). His loss will be deeply felt. Our deepest sympathies to his wife, Georgine, and his sons, Steven, Stuart and Robert. Robert Aquino, M.D., President Fred S. Fensterer, M.D., Chairman, Board of Trustees
