        VECSEY - May Spencer. Wife, mother, journalist, union activist. The family mourns the death of May Spencer Vecsey at 91, on December 4, 2002. However, we also celebrate her life and gallant struggle against Multiple Sclerosis. Born in England, she migrated with her family to the U.S. and lived in Holliswood, Queens, for 70 years. An honors graduate of Jamaica High and the College of New Rochelle, she became Society Editor of the Long Island Press. In 1937 she married George Stephen Vecsey, the Sports Editor, and both helped establish the Newspaper Guild. Later, she devoted her strong will and intelligence to raising five children: George Spencer Vecsey, Elisabeth Gembecki, Peter Vecsey, Janet O'Rourke and Christopher Vecsey. Her husband passed in 1984. She is also survived by 13 grandchildren and nine great-grand children. A funeral mass will be celebrated at the Immaculate Conception Roman Catholic Church, 86-45 Edgerton Blvd, Jamaica Estates, Queens, at 12 PM on Saturday, December 7. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that contributions go to the Chapin Home for the Aging, 165-01 Chapin Parkway, Jamaica, NY 11432.
