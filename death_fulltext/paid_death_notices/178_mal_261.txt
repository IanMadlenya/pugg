        BOMEISLER-Robert Evans, 78, on November 12, 2001, in Santa Monica, CA, of Multiple Myeloma. Born in Santa Monica on December 18, 1922, son of New Yorkers Kathryn and Louis Edwin Bomeisler, Jr., ''Bo'' was a man of many gifts and passions, which he shared freely with family and friends. A WWII veteran, he was a radio technician on the USS Eaton. A UCLA alumnus, he had a career in technology and computers, retiring from Xerox in 1987. Bo, who was young at heart for his entire lifetime, was an all-around athlete par excellence, inveterate genealogist, computer guru, and loyal friend to many. He leaves his loving family: daughter, Anne Bomeisler Farrell (John), Del Mar, CA; son Brian Evans Bomeisler (Roya) and granddaughter Sophie Rose, NYC; former wife, Dr. Betty Edwards, Santa Monica; and brother Donald Bomeisler and family.
