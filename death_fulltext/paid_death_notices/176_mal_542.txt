        FRENKEL-PETER. The people of PACE Advertising Agency, are saddened by the passing of our dear friend, associate and partner of over 50 years. Peter's contribution to our success is inestimable. His clients, and we at PACE, trusted and loved him. Although he retired in 1986, his lessons and business philosophy are used to this day. He was a respected professional and a very special man. Milton Bagley, Chairman Sean Grimes, President Richard Nulman, CEO
        FRENKEL-PETER. Our lives changed when we met Peter forty three years ago. He was a dear friend, a partner in many businesses and, above all, a mentor who, by his example, taught generosity, trust, compassion and the incessant desire to live life to its fullest. We truly loved him; his good deeds will never be forgotten. Joan & Milton Bagley
