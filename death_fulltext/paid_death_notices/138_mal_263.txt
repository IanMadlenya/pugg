        MANUGUERRA-Matteo. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of our beloved colleague, Matteo Manuguerra. An uncommonly eloquent interpreter of the great baritone roles in the Italian and French repertory, he sang 127 performances of 15 roles with the company following his debut as Enrico in ''Lucia di Lammermoor'' in 1971. An actor of great versatility, he will be remembered with admiration for his powerful Rigoletto & his malevolent Barnaba in ''La Gioconda'' as well as many vivid interpretations of the major Verdi roles. We extend our sincere condolences to his wife Michelle and his three children. Joseph Volpe, General Manager James Levine, Artistic Director
