        SHATAN--Norma Altstedter. Died on July 26th, 2005 after a valiant four year battle with cancer. Born July 18th, 1932 in Flushing, NY, Norma was the beloved mother of Gregory Shatan, Gabrielle Shatan, Jessica Heslin and Jeremy Shatan, and mother-in-law of Deborah Elkind, Seymour Pardo, Terence Heslin and Karen Capucilli. Norma was also a loving grandmother to Nicholas, Maximilian, David, Sarah, Jacob (who predeceases her), Hannah and Noah. The widow of Chaim Shatan, MD, she is also survived by her sister, Joan Joseph of Los Angeles. A lifelong resident of NYC, Norma also kept a house near Stockbridge, MA. Norma's liveliness attracted many friends who knew her as an avid skier, tennis player and jazz fan. Her love of skiing took a professional turn some 15 years ago when she became an instructor at Butternut Basin in Great Barrington, MA. Norma was an accomplished artist, co-founding the Prince Street Gallery in 1970. Her 12th solo show was in October 2004. Norma studied art history at Goucher and received her MFA from Columbia University in 1983. Her cotranslation of Wolfflin's ''The Sense of Form in Art'' was her thesis. All who knew Norma will miss the warmth and brightness she brought to their lives and choose to remember her getting that last run in after the lifts had closed, experiencing the fullness of the life she enjoyed so much. Services Thursday at 11:45 at ''The Riverside,'' 76th St. and Amsterdam Ave.
