        AGNELLI-Giovanni. It is with deep sadness that we note the passing of Gianni Agnelli, a longtime treasured friend and supporter of The Museum of Modern Art and its International Council. He was a charismatic and beloved figure in Italy and throughout the world, with a passionate commitment to the arts. As a devoted patron, collector, and connoisseur, his involvement was farreaching and generous. It was Gianni's unique vision that created Palazzo Grassi in Venice, which exemplified his commitment to honoring the past while cherishing contemporary life and art. He will be very much missed by all of us at the Museum, and we send our heartfelt sympathy to his wife Marella, his daughter Margherita, and to the entire Agnelli family.

Lowry, Director The Museum of Modern Art Brian Urquhart, Chairman Emeritus Agnes Gund, Chairman Jo Carole Lauder, President The International Council of The Museum of Modern Art
