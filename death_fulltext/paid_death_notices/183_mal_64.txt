        GILLMAN-Stanley. We mourn the passing of our longtime friend and colleague. A member of the firm for over 50 years, Stanley's leadership, dedication and principles guided our firm to a preeminent position in the accounting profession. After serving with distinction during World War II, Stanley joined the firm on a permanent basis shortly thereafter. For many years he served as Chairman of the firm, and was a guiding force in its growth during the period of his stewardship. A member of several philanthropic boards and as a friend and advisor to a score of prominent companies and individuals, his wisdom and integrity will be sorely missed. Our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Hannie, his son BJ and the rest of his family. The Partners and staff Yohalem Gillman & Company
