        SHAPIRO-Malcolm, on May 1, 1997 (age 42). The Lansco Corporation mourns with great sadness the sudden and untimely passing of our good friend and colleague. Prior to his association with Lansco, he was employed by IBM Corporation for nearly twenty years. He was a devoted son and our deepest sympathies go to his mother, Jean. Mal's good counsel, wisdom and wit will be sorely missed by all.
