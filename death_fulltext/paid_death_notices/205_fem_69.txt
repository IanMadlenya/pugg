        SPORN--Josephine ''Jo'' Naomi Levine. 1929-2004, died on February 5. Amour, beloved wife and best friend of Paul for 53 years; loving mother of Peter and his wife Barbara Ransby and of Pamela and her husband Pablo Foster, Jo leaves behind much adored grandchildren Jason, Asha and Lelanie: all the future of her heart and hopes. Also survived by sister Phyllis Merrick and brother Leonard Levine, and many other relatives. At 16, the youngest student in the summer of 1946 at Black Mountain College in Ashville, NC, Jo was an artist and designer of taste that never faded; that taught those around her the importance of art in life and how to make an art out of life. We cherish and love her. Memorial service is scheduled for Saturday, February 14, 2004, at 11:30 AM, at The Arts Club of Chicago, 201 East Ontario Street, Chicago, IL 60611. In lieu of flowers contributions may be made to The American Lung Assocation of Metropolitan Chicago, 1440 West Washington Blvd, Chicago, IL 60607.
