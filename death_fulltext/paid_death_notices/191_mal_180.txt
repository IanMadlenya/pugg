        CROSBY-John O. It is with great sadness that Manhattan School of Music mourns the passing of John Crosby, the School's president from 1976-1986. His extraordinary vision continues to influence generations of singers and Manhattan School of Music is privileged to carry forth with his legacy. The professionalism and musical insight that were his gifts to Manhattan School of Music and the opera world will be profoundly missed by all. David A. Rahm, Chairman, Board of Trustees Marta Istomin, President
