        LAREDO--Ruth. On behalf of the international music publishing firm of C.F. Peters, we regret with much affection and deepest sympathy the passing of Ruth Laredo. Current and future generations of musicians will forever benefit from the new Urtext publications of Rachmaninoff Preludes that Ruth researched and prepared for the Edition Peters catalogue with her usual highest standards of musical excellence and integrity.
