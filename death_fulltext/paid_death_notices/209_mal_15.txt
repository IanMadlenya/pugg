        HALBERT -- Mannie. The Board of Trustees and staff of The Chemotherapy Foundation mourn with deepest sorrow the passing of Mannie Halbert, beloved Honorary Trustee, staunch benefactor and friend of 35 years. His sophisticated understanding and dedicated efforts were profoundly influential in expanding the Foundation's grant programs and advancing chemotherapy research and clinical science for the control, cure, and prevention of cancer through innovative medical therapies. In 1972, Mannie and his family were co-sponsors in launching our original Chemotherapy Laboratory in the Division of Medical Oncology at The Mount Sinai School of Medicine, and in 1989 were distinguished benefactors, once again, to accomplish the Lab's rebuilding and expansion. Mannie has been a driving force and an inspiration to us all to pursue the promise on the horizon. Progress achieved through our aggressive research efforts will forever remain a tribute to his unwavering encouragement. His warmth of spirit and steadfast loyalty of more than three decades will be remembered with affection and gratitude always. Ezra M. Greenspan, M.D. Chairman & Medical Director Barry Richter, President Chemotherapy Foundation
