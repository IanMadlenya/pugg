        BUTSON-Thomas G., 68. Formerly of the New York Times and, until recently, Editor of The Villager. Died on January 3, after a 10 year valiant fight with cancer.

A memorial service will be held Thursday, January 13, at 5 PM, at St. Luke's in the Fields Church, 487 Hudson St, NYC. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the International Multiple Myeloma Foundation, 2129 Stanley Hills Drive, Los Angeles, CA 90046.
