        THACHER--Thomas, on December 10, 2004 at age 88. For 42 years (1956-1998) a Member of the Board of Managers of The Havens Relief Fund Society. From 1978 to 1990 he served with distinction as our President. Thereafter, at the Board's insistence, he was thrice re-elected as Manager for an additional 8 years until retirement at 82 in 1998. With grace and firm insistence, he taught us his conviction that the Society's success was attributable to its adherence with singleness of purpose, and dedication to the goals of its Founder, ''to relieve poverty and distress, and especially the offering of temporary relief to unobtrusive suffering endured by industrious or worthy persons''.

We extend our sympathies to his wife, Barbara, his children and grandchildren. David O. Beim, Chairman Kate French, President
