        JACOBS--William Jay. On Friday, April 30 in Greenwich, Connecticut. Dr. Jacobs was a teacher and writer of history and biography for young readers. He was associate professor of social studies education at Hunter College, and director of Teacher Education at Ramapo College of New Jersey. From 1975 until his retirement in 1993, ''Dr. J'' was chair of the History Department at Darien High School. In 1978 he visited the People's Republic of China with a group of Darien High School students in a pioneering effort to promote SinoAmerican relations. Dr. Jacobs wrote more than thirty biographies and textbooks. A sign over his desk reminded him that he was writing for ''a very special audience: young people searching for models, trying to understand themselves.'' He enjoyed playing baseball with his grandson, Max and his seven other grandsons by marriage. He will be deeply missed by his wife Susan, daughter Catherine, son Adam, and all his grandsons. Services and burial private. Donations may be made to the American Civil Liberties Union, 125 Broad St, 18th Floor, NY, NY 10004.
