        GREENBERG-Filomen D'Agostino. The New York University community grieves for the loss of Filomen D'Agostino Greenberg. Trustee, alumna, distinguished lawyer and friend, she maintained an active, life-ong interest in the University. We were deeply grateful for her generosity and appreciative of her commitment to NYU. On behalf of the entire University, we offer our deepest sympathies to her family, loved ones and friends. We were proud to have her in our ranks and she will be missed. L. Jay Oliva, President Martin Lipton, Chairman
