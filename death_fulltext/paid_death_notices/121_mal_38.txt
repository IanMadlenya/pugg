        BERNSTEIN-Frank. The Board of Directors of Rivercross is deeply saddened by the passing of our General Manager and Corporate Secretary. He was an excellent Manager, but more importantly, Frank was a constant reassuring presence, a friend. He was head of our household, part of the fabric of our building, and as such will be greatly missed. We wish to extend our sympathies to his wife Marsha, daughters Brenda and Abigail, son-in-law Michael, and all of his familty members. John P. Weatherhead, Jr. President
