        MARKS-Edwin S. The directors, officers, associates and staff of Carl Marks & Co, and its affiliated companies mourn the passing of our beloved and admired friend, colleague and chairman. Edwin Marks was a man of keen intelligence, unshakable integrity and great compassion for his fellow human beings. His philanthropy was legendary, as was his profound love of family and country. We extend our deepest sympathy to his adored Nancy, his daughters Carolyn, Linda, and Connie, his sister Marjorie Boas Levins and all the other members of the Marks and Boas families.
