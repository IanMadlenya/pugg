        MARDER-Jules. On April 5, 2002. We sadly mourn the loss, cherish the memory and celebrate the life of our beloved Jules. Husband of Harriett, father of Randy and Nadine, father-in-law of David Frieberg, brother of Mel and Judy, grandfather of Gabriel and Jenna. Service Monday, 11:45 AM, at ''The Riverside,'' 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue.
        MARDER-Jules. To my big brother, the best brother one could have. A caring son to his parents, who gave them respect and emotional guidance in their twilight years. To his wife Harriett, she was his best friend. They were husband and wife, brother and sister. He used to kid her in front of people by saying, ''You're my whole life,'' and he meant it. To his children Nadine, Randy, David and his grandchildren, he was so proud of them, their togetherness and accomplishments in life. He was an easy-going person who never had a bad word to say about anybody. He will be fondly remembered and sorely missed by all those who knew and adored him. With much love. Mel, Judy, Robert, Allison and John
        MARDER-Jules. Our deepest sympathies are extended to our dear friends Randy, Nadine and David on the loss of their loving father, and Bop-Bop to Gabrielle and Jenna. Our heart goes out to his loving wife Harriett. We will all miss him. With Love, Jennifer and Peter Simel
