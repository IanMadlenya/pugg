        BRONFMAN--Andrea. The Washington Institute for Near East Policy mourns the passing of Andrea ''Andy'' Bronfman. A Trustee of the Institute for more than a decade, Andy understood the vital role America needs to play in the pursuit of a secure ArabIsraeli peace and the critical importance of the U.S.-Israel partnership in that effort. Andy's wisdom, insight, experience, and boundless energy were a source of strength to all Americans committed to security and peace in the Middle East. Her sensitivity, creativity and humanity were an inspiration to everyone she touched. We extend our deepest condolences to the entire Bronfman family. Howard P. Berkowitz, President Fred S. Lafer, Chairman Robert Satloff, Executive Director Dennis Ross, Counselor and Distinguished Ziegler Fellow
        $(6$)BRONFMAN--Andrea. Andy, I will always treasure our joyous dancing at Birthright mega-events and wonderful hikes through the hills and forests in Jerusalem. Our beloved Jewish community has lost an unparalleled advocate and I have lost a true friend. Your enthusiasm, generosity, and compassion were contagious, and your vision for AIDA, the Association for Israel's Decorative Arts, an inspiration I promise to pursue. Your memory is a blessing and your legacy enduring. I will miss you dearly. Charles, my heart is with you, your children and grandchildren during this difficult time. Love, Lynn Schusterman
