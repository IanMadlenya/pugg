        PAINE--Ellen (Sis) Lea, 93, died peacefully at home in Hobe Sound, FL on March 3rd after a brief illness. She was recently predeceased by her husband of 71 years, Peter S. Paine. The Paines also maintained a seasonal residence in Willsboro, NY on Lake Champlain and, at one time, a town house in Manhattan. She is survived by her son, Peter S. Paine, Jr. and his wife, Patty, of Willsboro, NY, three grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. A welcoming and elegant hostess, she was a formidable organizer and was respectfully (but affectionately) known as ''La Generale''. She maintained a life-long interest in health care and served for years as Board Member of the Visiting Nurse Service of New York City. In addition, she and her husband played a vital role in building and supporting the Smith House Health Care Center in Willsboro. An avid gardener, she took great pride in the gardens of her family properties and was an active member of the Essex County-Adirondack Garden Club. There will be a joint celebration of the Paine's lives in Willsboro next summer for family and friends. In lieu of flowers, donations in her memory to: Visiting Nurse Service of NY; Smith House Health Care Center, Willsboro, NY; Essex County-Adirondack Garden Club, Essex, NY; or the Nature Conservancy of Florida, Altamonte Springs, FL.
