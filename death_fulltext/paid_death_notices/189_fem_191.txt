        CALDERON-Patricia Diane. Patricia Calderon did everything in a special way. She moved from Seattle to New York at age 17. She started her career as a secretary and ended it as a partner in an advertising agency and one of the pioneers and foremost experts in the new field of interactive marketing. Pat embraced her new city and her life in New York with passion and humor distinctly her own. She gave her love, companionship and counsel to so many of us, sharing her specialness, making us each feel special in turn. Pat was an avid sailor. She was amazingly creative, yet also had a wonderful analytical mind. As much as she loved us, Pat had a special passion for two special Bearded Collies, MooShu and Browser. Pat passed away on October 20, at age 42, after a grueling battle with breast cancer. True to herself, she fought the battle in a special waywith dignity, grace, resolve and grit. Pat leaves behind her dad, Dennis, her mom, Esther, her brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews and many friends who counted Pat as family as well. Pat made all of us better; that was her most special gift of all. To honor her life, please send donations in Pat's name to the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. To celebrate her life, there will be a gathering of family and friends on November 9, time and place to be announced. Suffice it to say, it, like our Pat, will be special.
