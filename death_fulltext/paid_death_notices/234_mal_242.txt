        STECKLER--Stanley A, MD The Officers, Councilors, and Trustees of the Medical Society of the State of New York record with deep sorrow the passing of their esteemed friend and colleague Stanley A Steckler, MD. He graced with his presence the lives of innumerable patients, friends, and fellow physicians. Dr. Steckler was a caring physician, knowledgeable medical practitioner, and mentor to many young physicians seeking career guidance. As President of the Medical Society of the State of New York (1993-1994), his leadership and thoughtful deliberation were invaluable in the formation of society policy. His important contribution to the medical profession included serving as an officer of the state medical society's Empire Foundation as well as chairing of the society's Board of Trustees. Dr. Steckler was a board-certified urologist and a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons, a member of the American Association of Clinical Urologists and the American Urological Association. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife Teddie and his sons David, Jonathan, and Robert, as well as to his five grandchildren. Richard M. Peer, MD President Medical Society of the State of New York
