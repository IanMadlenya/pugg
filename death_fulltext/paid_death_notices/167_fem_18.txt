        ELKON-Frances. Boys Town Jerusalem mourns the passing of a loyal friend, who, together with her husband, Max Elkon, was a Chai Founder. The Elkons also endowed a science laboratory and established a major endowment to provide scholarship assistance to deserving and needy students. Max's affiliation with Boys Town began almost five decades ago, shortly after the school was founded. We extend heartfelt sympathy to the entire family. Michael J. Scharf, President Raphael Benaroya, Chairman Josh S. Weston, Hon. Chairman Rabbi Ronald Gray, Exec. V.P.
