        LENIHAN-Kenneth J. We mourn the passing of Ken Lenihan, retired Professor of Sociology at John Jay College. Ken had extraordinary compassion, an uncommon wit and the brilliance and melancholy of the finest Irish poets. He will be treasured and missed by his dear sisters, Eileen, Moira, Jean & Sue; his loving children, Bill, Andrew & Jean, & his bereft grandchildren, Psachya, Tsvi and Julia. Service on Friday, May 30, 1:15 P.M., at Riverside Chapel.
