        SIPSER--Morris. The officers and staff of Israel Bonds mourn the passing of Morris Sipser, a founding professional of the organization. After serving in important executive posts in Miami and Philadelphia, Morris achieved the top staff position of Executive Vice President and National Campaign Director. Until his retirement in 1989, his brilliant leadership and empowering vision spurred the organization to unprecedented sales achievements, contributing enormously to Israel's impressive economic development. Our heartfelt condolences to his family and friends. Joshua Matza, President and CEO Burton P. Resnick, Chairman of the Board Michael Siegal, Vice Chairman of the Board Bobbie Goldstein, Nat'l Campaign Chairman Joel Gutterman, Nat'l Campaign Director
