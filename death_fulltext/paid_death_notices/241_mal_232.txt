        CALDWELL--William Webster, III, died, unexpectedly, of heart failure, February 9. Beloved husband and father, brother and son, friend and colleague, Wall Street trader, athlete, generous citizen of Brooklyn Heights, New York and Norfolk, Connecticut. He is deeply mourned by his wife, Priscilla Vail Caldwell, his daughters, Olivia and Caroline Caldwell, his father and brothers, William Jr., Christopher and Daniel, by Shelly and Catherine Caldwell of Vero Beach, Florida, and the Caldwell's extended family, by Priscilla's parents, Beverly and Robert Vail of Canton, Ohio, and their family, by colleagues from First New York Securities, and by countless friends and associates -from Florida, Westminster School, Northwestern University, Norfolk, Connecticut, from Asia and other of the many places where Will traveled, worked, made friends and dedicated his support and enthusiasm to worthy causes. He was a magnificent magnet who drew all sorts of people into his orbit; his only criterion was the goodness he never failed to find in others. Handsome and youthful, a lifelong, gifted athlete, a disciplined thinker, a generous friend, he was, above all, a loving husband, a devoted and adoring father to his beautiful daughters, Olivia and Caroline. We will love him always. He was the mirror in which we saw the best reflection of ourselves. We will never forget him.
