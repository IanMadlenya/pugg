        EVENSEN-Bryn. 46, of a heart attack on January 4, 2000. A man of extraordinary wit and energy, who could scull ten miles, build out a kitchen, manage a fund raiser and play concertos -all before cocktails. Fresh out of Harvard, he built one of the most successful U.S. fund raising companies and was personally devoted to several charities. His family, many, many friends, and more than a few nonprofit organzations will miss him. A remembering party will be held in March.
