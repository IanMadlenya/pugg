        HORWITZ--Marshall S., M.D. The Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University notes with immense sadness the sudden passing of our beloved Chair of Microbiology & Immunology. A member of the Einstein faculty for nearly 40 years, Dr. Horwitz also was the Leo and Julia Forchheimer Professor of Microbiology & Immunolgy, as well as Professor of Pediatrics and of Cell Biology. His leadership and devotion to the medical school was evident in the countless roles he undertook, including director of the Pediatric Infectious Disease Program, associate director of the Medical Scientist Training Program and of the Albert Einstein Cancer Center, and helping to establish and maintain the research program in the Department of Pediatrics. As a scientist, Dr. Horwitz was internationally renowned for his study of the biology of adenoviruses, particularly his development of cell-free systems for adenovirus DNA replication. His most current research focused on understanding how the virus causes disease and how it interacts with the immune system. As a colleague, clinician, scientist, and mentor, he touched the lives of countless individuals throughout the Einstein community. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his wife and longtime member of the Einstein family, Dr. Susan B. Horwitz, cochair of Molecular Pharmacology and Rose C. Falkenstein Professor of Cancer Research; to his sons, Joshua and Bruce, and to the entire Horwitz family. Dominick P. Purpura, M.D. The Marilyn and Stanley M. Katz Dean Albert Einstein College of Medicine Richard M. Joel, President Yeshiva University
