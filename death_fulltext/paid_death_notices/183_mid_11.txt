        ASKIN-Alma. The officers, Board of Directors and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Alma Askin, a cherished friend of the organization who, with her family, expressed a deep commitment to Jewish and other humanitarian causes. The exceptional generosity of Mrs. Askin's brothers, David Durst and the late Seymour and Royal, has left a lasting mark on our community. The Hebrew Free Loan Society, a UJA-Federation beneficiary agency, has been particularly touched by the Durst family. Both David and his father, Joseph, served as presidents of the organization. Mrs. Askin's son, Peter, is a former board member of the Society as well. Mrs. Askin's legacy lives on in the exemplary efforts of her family. Mrs. Askin's nephew, Douglas Durst, and his relatives, continue to carry on the philanthropic tradition of the Askin and Durst families, on behalf of the Durst Foundation. We extend our deepest sympathies to Peter, David, & Douglas; to Mrs. Askin's daughter, Nan Rothschild Cooper; to her seven grandchildren; & to the entire Askin & Durst families. Larry Zicklin, President Morris W. Offit, Chair of the Board John S. Ruskay, Exec VP & CEO Leonard A. Wilf, Chair of Real Estate Division
