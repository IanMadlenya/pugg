We mourn the passing of a great man, whose quiet, smiling, brilliant and charming presence will be sorely missed. He was a wonderful partner to Mary Ellin and a friend to us all. Always supportive of the activities of the office, he had an extraordinary ability to find and alert us--always with good cheer--to obscure uses of Irving Berlin's works that we may not have known about. We will miss him for that and for his overall wisdom. We send our condolences to Mary Ellin and the entire Barrett family.
