        KRUG-Phil. Friends and colleagues in LSNY and elsewhere in the public interest legal community mourn the sudden death of Phil Krug in a car accident on August 7. For almost 3 decades Phil was a vigorous, dedicated staff attorney at Harlem Legal Services where he provided legal assistance to countless low income people in the Harlem community. He will be greatly missed.
