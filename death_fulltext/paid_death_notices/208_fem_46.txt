        STERNBERG -- Irma Kad mon. The Board of Directors and staff of the International Rescue Committee note with great sorrow the passing of our dear retired colleague, Irma Kadmon Sternberg, on May 5th at Parkway Hospital in Forest Hills, NY. Irma came to the United States during World War II as a refugee from Nazi-occupied Europe and joined the IRC as a caseworker in New York in 1945. For many years she served as director of refugee resettlement programs before retiring in 1985. With kindness, dignity and respect, she helped thousands of refugees from all parts of the world begin new lives in the United States. Her beloved husband of 53 years, Charles (Carel) Sternberg, former executive director of the IRC, died in 2003. We extend our condolences to Irma's friends and loved ones. Winston Lord and James C. Strickler, M.D. Co-Chairmen of the Board George Rupp, President
