        LOHR-Steve, 91, died June 21 at his Manhattan home. A pioneer in Alpine skiing and ski travel advocate for more than fifty years, he conceived and developed ski tours to the Alps by air. Born in Austria, he immigrated to the U.S. in 1941. After a tour in the U.S. Army, he joined a New York travel agency, organizing the first ski tour to the Alps in 1952 and founding Europe on Skis, which later became the official ski tour operator of Swissair. In 1989 he founded Steve Lohr's Ski Holidays, which became a division of Central Holidays, a company of FAR&WIDE Travel Corp. He remained Division President until his death. A member of ASTA, he was the recipient of several high Austrian honors. He is survived by Ruth, his wife of thirty-six years.
