        LEMBO--Anna ''Nana.'' Caring, generous and loving great-grandmother, grandmother and mother. Nana's passion was her family. Nana took care of three generations of Lembos. Nana's art were her meatballs, lasagna, ziti, chocolate chip cookies or anything she prepared. No one will miss Nana more than us. We know that Poppa, Chippy and Pepper are waiting at a table for the best food in heaven. Nana was known in certain circles as the Saint and to everyone else endearingly as Nana. We love you. Thank you. Loving you forever and always. Christina, Matthew, Michael and Robert
        LEMBO--Anna. Dear Mom, It just won't be the same coming home and not smelling one of your sauces. Goodbye to the best mom and friend anyone could ever have had. Love, Your son, Daniel
