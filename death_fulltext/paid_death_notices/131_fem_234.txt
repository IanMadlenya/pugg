        OFFIT-Rhea. The Officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation mourn the passing of Rhea Offit, mother of Morris W. Offit, a vice president of UJA-Federation of New York and one of our country's outstanding philanthropists. Her dedication to the needy was as passionate as her devotion to her family. She was a righteous person who passed on a world of Jewish values to her children: Sara Abeshouse, a generous supporter of the Baltimore federation, and Morris, chief executive officer of OFFITBANK; and her grandchildren, Ned, Daniel, Mark and Lynn. Mrs. Offit's tradition of caring has been continued by her family in their humanitarian work. To them, we send our deepest sympathies. May you be consoled among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair Louise B. Greilsheimer, President Stephen D. Solender, Exec. V.P.
