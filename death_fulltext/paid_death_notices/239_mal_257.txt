        KUPFRIAN--Wilbur. New Jersey Institute of Technology mourns the death of its distinguished alumnus Wilbur Kupfrian, class of 1933, engineer, inventor, patent attorney, entrepreneur, and loyal supporter for whom the University's Kupfrian Hall is named. His dedication to his alma mater will be sorely missed.
