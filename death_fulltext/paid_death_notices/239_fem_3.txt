        PROPPER--Karen S., The Board of Directors and staff of Amsterdam Nursing Home mourn the loss of our valued Administrator, Karen S. Propper, who died on November 29, 2006 after a long battle against cancer. Mrs. Propper devoted her life's work to the improvement of the welfare and quality of life for the frail elderly. She began her health care career in 1982 as Assistant Director of the Taylor Care Center, Westchester County Medical Center. She transformed the Taylor Care Center into a modern stateof-the-art nursing home. In 1989 she was appointed Associate Director of Amsterdam Nursing Home located in New York City. While at Amsterdam she was responsible for daily operations and provided oversight for a $46 million renovation and expansion project. Above all, she provided intelligent and compassionate leadership for Amsterdam House, a highly respected long-term care facility in the metropolitan area. Karen Propper received her Bachelor's degree from the College of New Rochelle and a Master's degree in Health Care Administration from Pace University. She served on many local and state association committees in her ongoing efforts to improve the quality of life for the aged. She will be dearly missed by the health care community, her colleagues and co-workers and the thousands of seniors who have been served under her leadership.
