        SEIDLER--Lynn. The Board and staff of The Shubert Foundation are deeply saddened by the loss of Lynn Seidler, our longtime Executive Director. Her exceptional vision and dedication were instrumental in the development of The Foundation as a leading supporter of not-forprofit theatre and dance companies in America. Lynn was also the motivating force behind the establishment of The Shubert Archive, which has become one of the foremost theatre research institutions in the country. She will be greatly missed. Our deepest sympathy to our dear friend and Board member, Lee, daughter, Laurie, and grandson, Isaac. Gerald Schoenfeld, Chairman Michael I. Sovern, President Vicki Reiss, Exec. Director The Shubert Foundation
