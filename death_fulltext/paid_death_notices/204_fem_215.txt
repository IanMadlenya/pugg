        SELVER -- Irmgard (nee Frank), died on January 19, 2004 in New York City surrounded by devoted family and friends. Born August 24, 1906 in Chemnitz, Germany, she married Karl Goeritz with whom she had two children. In 1939 she lost her immediate family when the boat on which they fled war-torn Europe was mined. She came to New York in 1942 where she met and married Henry Selver, also of Chemnitz. They had two daughters, Irene and Veronica, and lived in France where Henry worked for the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee until his death in 1957. Irmi and her daughters returned to New York where Irmi worked as a secretary and massage therapist well into her 80s. Since 1966 Irmi made a second home for herself in her beloved Truro, Cape Cod. Irmi never lost her courage, her optimism, her strength and her love of family and friends. Her indomitable spirit will continue to inspire all who knew her and we will miss her terribly. She is survived by her loving daughters, Irene and Veronica, Veronica's partner Cappy, and her cherished granddaughters Anna and Eve. Donations in Irmi's honor can be made to the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services for the Goeritz Fund, established by Irmi in memory of her first two children (Frank and Irene Goeritz), 120 W. 57 St, NY, NY 10019. A memorial service will be held Thursday, January 22, at 1:30PM at Ansche Chesed, 251 W. 100 St, Manhattan.
