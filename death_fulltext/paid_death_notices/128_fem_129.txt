        SHAPIRO-Sue. The Elaine Kaufman Cultural Center community mourns the passing of our beloved Sue. Her involvement, commitment, and passion for the Center's students and its concerts spanned almost a half century. Her wisdom, enthusiasm, guidance and leadership will be sorely missed. Our deepest sympathy is with her adored nieces, Mina Laskey and Rose-Barbara Neustadt and their families. Lydia Kontos, Exec. Director Leonard Goodman, Chairman Elaine Kaufman, President
