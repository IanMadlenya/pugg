        MARKUS--Rita. The American Committee for the Weizmann Institute of Science mourns the passing of longtime friend, Rita Markus. A member of the President's Circle, which acknowledges the Institute's most visionary benefactors, she provided critical support in the areas of biological physics, electron microscopy, and laser technology. She considered the Institute a force for good in the world, and her warmth and generosity of spirit will never be forgotten. We send heartfelt condolences to her family. Robert B. Machinist, Chairman, American Committee Dr. Albert Willner, President, American Committee Martin S. Kraar, Exec VP, American Committee Stuart Eizenstat, Chairman, Weizmann Institute Prof. Ilan Chet, President, Weizmann Institute
