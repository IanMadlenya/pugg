        WITTLIN-WEISS-Randi. 40, on October 6, after a courageous, prolonged bout with breast cancer. A love of life, a positive attitude and an unwavering determination to forge on and lead a ''normal'' life as a devoted wife and a nurturing mother... these were some of the qualities that defined Randi, that made her who she was, her modus operandi. That she was able to continually exhibit such fortitude and verve, notwithstanding the many challenges her fateful predicament brought, had those around her, family, friends, and neighbors alike, always marveling. As one special friend recalled, ''To accept fate without bitterness is rare, to accept it as Randi did, with such strength and resolve, is remarkable.'' After graduating with a marketing degree in 1983 from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, Randi pursued a career in marketing with Forbes, and subsequently with Times-Mirror Magazines. Randi is survived by her husband Ken, sons Roy and Gil, father Mike, brothers Ellis and Richard, in-laws Neil and Virginia, Ruth, Debbie, Sari, Douglas, David and Liz Darby, and nephews Donald, jared, Todd, Darren and Stefan. An inspiraton to us all, Randi will forever be in our hearts. We suggest contributions be made to the American Cancer Society, Breast Cancer Research, 19 W. 56th St, NYC 10019-3984.
