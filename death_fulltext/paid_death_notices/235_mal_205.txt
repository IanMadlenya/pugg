        SMITH--James W., M.D. The administration and staff of the Center for Specialty Care, 50 East 69 St., New York, NY, mourn the death of our friend and inspiration; the founder of the Center, its Chairman of the Board and Medical Director. His farsighted vision for the delivery of the highest quality of medical care in an ambulatory setting was achieved. We extend our sympathy and love to his beloved wife Nancy and to their children and grandchildren.
