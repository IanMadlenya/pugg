        KRISBERG -- Norman. The Mary McDowell Center for Learning mourns the loss of one of our founding Trustees and most dedicated supporters. We love, respected and depended on Norman. He was particularly effective at combining business sense and common sense with the Quaker process. As Treasurer and strong advocate for the purchase and renovation of our own building, he continually pressed our institution to grow. A visionary able to tend to details, he helped build a solid foundation for our school and center to benefit hundreds of students, their parents, the faculty and staff, and learning-disability professionals. We will deeply miss his integrity, loyalty, intelligence, love, and committment. Trustees, faculty and staff of The Mary McDowell Center for Learning
