His name will forever be a part of our history just as his deeds will inspire us to perpetuate the mission that was such an integral part of his life. We are indeed diminished in every way by his passing. Our most sincere condolences to Douglas and his mother, Rhoda. David Taub, Chairman David Glaser, President
