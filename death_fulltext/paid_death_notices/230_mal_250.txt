        WINSTON--Richard Alan. The House of Harry Winston is saddened by the great loss of Richard Winston, former vice president and salesman extraordinaire. He will be remembered by all for his charming and gentle manner, the twinkle in his eyes, and his wonderful stories about Uncle Harry and the history of the House of Winston. An invaluable mentor to colleagues, he made close and lasting friendships with his clients, many of international renown, who valued his absolute discretion. In addition to diamonds, Richard's passions included baseball, fishing and golf. Our thoughts are with his wife and family. Contributions in his memory can be made to the Weill-Cornell Breast Center, c/o Dr. Alexander Swistel, 425 E 61 St, 8th flr, NYC 10021
