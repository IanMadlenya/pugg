        GOSSETT--O. Milton. The Board of Directors and staff of The Eye-Bank for Sight Restoration are deeply saddened by the passing of O. Milton Gossett, our first ''Man of Vision'' honoree, long-time Board member and Honorary Director. As chairman of Compton Advertising and later Saatchi & Saatchi Worldwide, he generously supported our mission with priceless advertising and marketing techniques in the form of many outstanding public information materials. His largess was second only to his wonderfully kind and gentle manner. We shall miss him greatly. Patricia Dahl Executive Director/CEO The Eye-Bank for Sight Restoration, Inc.
