        PYNE--Eben. The Mount Desert Festival of Chamber Music in Northeast Harbor, ME mourns the passing of our esteemed Board President Eben Pyne. His wisdom, charm and expertise will be sorely missed by everyone associated with the festival. His love and enthusiasm for music underscored a firm commitment and unflagging dedication that were hallmarks of his stewardship. Our heartfelt sympathy goes to his lovely wife and longtime board member and patron, Nancy, and to his family. Robert L. Shafer, President-Elect Natalie Raimondi, Executive Director Todd Crow, Music Director
