        SULAM-Edna. The board and staff of the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services mourn the passing of Edna Sulam, the mother of Carol Zicklin, a JBFCF trustee. A loving wife, mother, grandmother and great-grandmother, Mrs. Sulam was also a volunteer in Florida for the City of Hope. We extend our deepest sympathies to Mrs. Zicklin and to Mrs. Sulam's husband, Gabriel; her son, Donald; her four grandchildren; and her five great-grandchildren. Joseph S. Kaplan, President Alan B. Siskind, Ph.D., Executive Vice President Paul Levine, CSW, Associate Executive Vice President Pinchas Berger, CSW, Director, Jewish Connections Programs
