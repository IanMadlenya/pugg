        WOLF-Benedict. We were so fortunate to know Dick and his beloved Miriam for over 25 years. Dick has now joined her, and if there is a Heaven, surely both of them are there together. While Dick added years, his mind and spirit remained forever young. He was insightful and fun to be with, and we will forever miss him. Diane and Arthur
