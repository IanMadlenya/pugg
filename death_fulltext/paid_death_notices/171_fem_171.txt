        KLEIN-Harriet J. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) deeply mourn the loss of Harriet J. Klein of Baltimore, beloved wife of Philip E. Klein, co-chair of the ATS Baltimore Chapter and Honorary Fellow of the Technion. Harriet and her husband achieved the highest level of support for the Technion and Israel as Technion Guardians, and received the Einstein Award, the highest ATS honor. Devoted members of the Baltimore Chapter for more than 20 years, they organized and hosted many events and supported vital Technion projects, most recently the Johns Hopkins UniversityTechnion Center for the Biomedical Sciences. We extend our sincere sympathy to Philip, sons Michael-a member of the ATS Board of Directors and a graduate of the 21st Century Top Leadership Development Program-Jeffrey and David, and the entire Klein family.
