        CONATY-Arthur. The President of Montefiore Medical Center and its Board of Trustees are profoundly saddened by the passing of Arthur Conaty, dear father of our esteemed colleague, Mr. Robert B. Conaty, executive vicepresident of operations. A giving man, devoted to his family and deeply committed to his community, he will be missed by all who had the privilege to know him. We extend our deep and heartfelt sympathy to his loving wife of 59 years, Marguerite; his daughters, Gayle Connolly, Joyce Conaty and Lynn McCabe; his son Robert; his ten grandchildren and six greatgrandchildren. Spencer Foreman, MD, President Jay B. Langner, Chairman Board of Trustees Montefiore Medical Center
