        SAMROCK-Hyla. Died at home on Friday, October 19, 2001. She was 84. Married for nearly 60 years to Victor Samrock, who passed away in 1995, she is survived by her children, Carl and Ellen; grandsons Gabriel and Steven; daughter-in-law Carol and other family members and friends. Born in Hartford, CT, Hyla (Rubin) came to New York as a teenager to study dance and joined the legendary modern dance pioneer Doris Humphrey and her troupe. She left the company in her early 20's to become a wife, mother and homemaker while continuing to follow her passionate commitment to liberal causes. She never finished high school but, through extensive reading and travel, became better educated and more knowledgeable than most college graduates. She loved the arts, especially theatre, music and painting. Her devoted family deeply mourns her passing. Memorial service to be held today, at 2 PM, Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street. In lieu of flowers, contributions can be made in her name to The Central Park Conservancy, 14 East 60th Street, NYC 10022. (centralparknyc.org).
