        ROCKEFELLER-Rodman C. The Trustees and Staff of The Museum of Modern Art and its International Council and staff are deeply saddened by the passing of Rodman C. Rockefeller, our longtime friend and colleague. Rodman served on the Board of the Museum from 1989 to 1996, was an active member of the Council since 1982, and a member of the Museum's Committee on Prints and Illustrated Books from 1990 to 1993. Rodman's abiding interest in Latin America was particularly exemplified in his commitment to contemporary art and cultural exchange, and he contributed greatly to the Museum's programs in those areas. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Sascha and his children, Meile, Peter, Stuart, and Michael, and his grandchildren. Ronald S. Lauder, Chairman Agnes Gund, President Glenn D. Lowry, Director The Museum of Modern Art, NY Brian Urquhart, Chairman Jo Carole Lauder, President The International Council of The Musuem of Modern Art
