        DALLA VILLA-Rt. Rev Msgr Anthony. In life and now in death, Monsignor Anthony Dalla Villa was quintessentially a priest. Totally dedicated to his calling, he served God and the Church devotedly and without reservation throughout his life. A deeply spiritual man, he was a treasured friend and confidant to Florence D'Urso and her family. He was always there for us in times of need as a most compassionate priest; and his guidance and spiritual strength were invaluable. We shall miss him terribly; and we offer our heartfelt condolences and love to his sister Angela, and her family. We take comfort, however, in knowing that his final call could not have come at a time or place more perfectly fitting for a man whose greatest joy in life was in being a priest. I pray that Our Lady of Guadalupe and St. Therese of Lisieux, to whom Monsignor had such great devotion, gave him a special welcome. I pray too, that Our Lord greeted him saying, ''Well done, my good and faithful servant''.

On his assignment to Saint Agnes Church in Manhattan in 2001, he was designated by the Holy See Protonotary Apostolic.
