        TARRSON-Emanuel B. The Faculty of the School of Dental and Oral Surgery of Columbia University notes with sorrow the untimely death of Emanuel ''Bud'' Tarrson in Chicago, on October 5, 1999. ''Bud'' Tarrson for many years was President and CEO of the John O. Butler Co., a leading maker of toothbrushes and other oral hygiene devices. He recognized the importance of dental education and research, and worked closely with dental scientists and clinicians to develop effective instruments for dental desease prevention. Mr. Tarrson was a great philanthropist in dentistry. Through his foundations, he has generously supported projects of numerous organizations included the World Health Organization, the March of Dimes, Project Hope, the American Fund for Dental Health, and the American College of Dentists. He was a trustee advisor of the American Fund for Health and a board member of the Academy of General Dentistry Foundation. Mr Tarrson, received a special award from the Republic of Panama in 1987 for his contribution to the dental health of the people of Panama and to the dental profession. He has received numerous honors including the Award of Merit of the American College of Dentists, honorary membership in the American Dental Association and the American Acadamy of Periodontology. Finally, he was a great friend of dental education and gave generously to a number of dental schools, including ours. The ''Bud'' Tarrson periodontal research laboratory in our School is a lasting memorial to him. We extend our sympathy to his wife Linda and his family. Allan J. Formicola, DDS, Dean
