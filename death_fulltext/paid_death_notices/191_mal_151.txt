        KAMINSKI-John S., 71. Died in Rhodes, Greece on November 8, 2002. Beloved husband of Jane, his wife of 34 years. Dear brother and brother-in-law of Claire and Bob Braun residing in St. Petersburg, Florida. Uncle of Tom, Margaret, Wendy, Frances, Alasdair, Teresa and David in Scotland. A civil engineer and N.Y.U. graduate, he worked in Saudi Arabia for Lummus and Bechtel companies and in Germany and Holland for Bechtel. Returning to the U.S. he joined the staff of Mauchley Associates in Philadelphia. This led to his taking up residence in New York City to start his own company, Critical Path Engineers through which he planned and scheduled construction in New York City and NY state for 35 years. John, with an equal passion for his profession and life, ever curious, travelled frequently with Jane. Favorite times were with friends, sharing laughter and lives. Forever in my heart.
