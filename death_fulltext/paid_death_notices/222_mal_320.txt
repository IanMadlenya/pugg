        DAVIS--John. Those of us fortunate enough to know John will remember his intense love for his family, dedicated community service, love of sports (especially rugby), and his great leadership skills. We will always hold on to his great sense of humor and his ability to energize every room he entered. In so many ways, John was larger than life, the modern day Warrior for many of us, and a true American success story. To his wonderful wife Pam and his beautiful children Alexandria, Caroline, Harry and Jacqueline, our deepest condolences. John's passing is a devastating loss to us all. He will be sorely missed and never forgotten. The Forum
