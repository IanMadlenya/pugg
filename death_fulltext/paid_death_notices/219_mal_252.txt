        ROBINSON--Arthur Paul, 64, on April 13, from cancer. Born in New York City January 30, 1941. Graduated Wagner College. M.A. (NYU). M.S. (Rutgers). Taught at Wagner six years, then moved to California. In 1967, he married Carole White. They went to the U.K., where he was a Publican in Bristol and Bath, returning to California in the 80's. Upon seeing a man eating garbage from a dumpster, he and Carole started taking nightly meals to the local Martinez homeless. This led to his founding a more extensive endeavor: People Feeding People, Inc. His deep faith in God brought him great comfort. His love of learning never flagged. His intellect was bolstered by a sharp wit and keen sense of humor. He enjoyed life, loved to hike, run marathons, philately, sail, garden and be with his wife and family. He is survived by his loving wife; children Melanie Martinoff and James Fisher; brothers Stephen and John; sister Maureen; grandchildren Michael, Nicholas, Morgan and Madeleine.
