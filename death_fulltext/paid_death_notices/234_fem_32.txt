        LIEBERSON - HUNT--Lorraine. We acknowledge with great sorrow the passing of our revered colleague and treasured friend, Lorraine Hunt Lieberson. Lorraine was a beacon of inspiration to all of us, and always will be. Her eloquence showed us what music was for. We extend our deepest sympathies to her husband Peter Lieberson, whose artistic and personal partnership with Lorraine shed warmth on the world.
