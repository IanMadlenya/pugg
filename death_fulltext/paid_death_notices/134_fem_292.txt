        SCHORR-Maria Grandy. The Juilliard School mourns the loss of Maria Grandy, distinguished member of the Dance Faculty for the past ten years. A teacher remarkable for her dedication and spirit, she was noted for her ability to inspire great progress in her students. She believed that the dancer's training should be all encompassing, involving all disciplines of the School. She will be missed by her students and colleagues alike, who found her boundless energy and enthusiasm a daily source of pleasure. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to her entire family.
