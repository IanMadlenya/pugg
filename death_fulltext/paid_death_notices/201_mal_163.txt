        MICHAELS -- Richard, 65, stage director, died of heart failure Saturday, September 13 in his home in Kingston, NY. He was 65. Before his retirement and move to Kingston he directed well over one hundred musical and dramatic productions. His offBroadway revival of ''No Strings'' was heralded as infinitely better than the original production and prompted Richard Rodgers to invite him to direct the national company of ''Two By Two''. Critics and actors alike regarded him as one of the best directors in the business. He worked with such stars as Pat O'Brien, Bill Bixby, Harvey Korman, Vicki Lawrence, Tom Poston, Dom DeLuise and scores of others. One critic wrote of his work: ''Mr. Michaels does for the musical theatre what Hitchcock does for suspense.'' He donated his body to the Anatomical Gift Program of Albany Medical College, NY. He is survived by his long time companion.
