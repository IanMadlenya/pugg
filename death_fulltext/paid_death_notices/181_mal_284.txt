        MOISOFF-Andrew. Temple Sinai of Roslyn records with profound sorrow the death of Andrew Moisoff, a young student in our religious school. Our hearts go out in sympathy to his parents Stephen and Susan, to his brother Daniel and to their entire family. We pray that God will be with them and extend comfort, compassion and strength at this darkest hour. Rabbi Michael A. White Rabbi Norman Kahan, Emeritus Toni Wiener, President
