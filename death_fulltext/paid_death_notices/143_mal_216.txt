        SPEKTOR-Eryk. We mourn the passing of a good friend and fine human being who devoted himself to honoring citizens of the world as ''Defenders of Jerusalem'' because of their worthy deeds in defense of the rights of the Jewish people. He selflessly sought glory for them as his contribution to a better world. We were privileged to work with him on this noble undertaking for many years. David Finn Carol Cavallo
