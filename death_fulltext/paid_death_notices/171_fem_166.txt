        CONN-Ruth. Of East Quogue and New York City, died on April 18, 2001 after a long and valiant fight against cancer, at her home in East Quogue, surrounded by those whom she loved most. Beloved wife of Stephen R. Conn and mother of Orin Conn and of Omri Green and Ira and Lynn Liran, she was the daughter of Yeshayahu and Renee Anug of Jerusalem and sister of Yigal Anug of Kfar Bilu, Israel. In her brief but brilliant 49 years, she reached out and touched the lives of thousands, always seeking to do more for others than she sought to do for herself. She strived to leave the world a better place than she found it and succeeded. Her spirit, energy, fierce independence, generosity, compassion and concern, combined with an inner and outer beauty, will live forever. A memorial service will be held in Manhattan at a date to be announced. In lieu of flowers, contributions in her memory may be made to the East End Hospice, Box 1048, Westhampton Beach, NY 11978.
