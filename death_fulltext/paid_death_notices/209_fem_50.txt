        KAHN--Betty. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) mourn the loss of Betty Kahn of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., beloved wife of D. Dan Kahn, a member of the ATS National Board of Directors and past Detroit Chapter president. Mrs. Kahn and her husband reached the highest level of support for the ATS, the Technion and Israel as Technion Guardians. Devoted members of the Detroit Chapter, they have provided over many years key funding for vital Technion projects, including the D. Dan and Betty Kahn Medical Robotics Laboratory and the Protective Shield. We extend our sincere sympathy to Dr. Kahn, their children Andrea, Mark and Patrice, and the entire Kahn family.
