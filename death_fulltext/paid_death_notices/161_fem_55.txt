        WERBER-Freda. AMIT is deeply saddened by the passing of our most dedicated and devoted National Board member. A true ''woman of valor,'' Freda (Mrs. Murray) Werber lived a life represented by the highest ideals of Torah values, loving kindness and charity. She was loved by all whose lives she touched. Her legacy lives on in her beloved and devoted son Victor, a most generous benefactor of AMIT and dedicated supporter of its mission to ''save the forgotten children of Israel.'' May her loving son, grandchildren, great grandchildren and the entire family, be consoled by the beautiful memories of a great woman, Freda Werber.
