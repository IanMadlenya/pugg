        EHRLICH-Betty Rosmarin. 79, of Ft. Lee, N.J. and Monroe, N.Y., died surrounded by her beloved family after a full, active life, on November 25. Predeceased by her husband Sam Ehrlich, she was the loving mother of Steven David Ehrlich (''my son the architect'') of Los Angeles and Renee Ehrlich Kalfus (''my daughter the costume designer'') of Millwood N.Y.; adoring grandmother of Onna, Rosy, Vanessa and Julia; devoted sister of Jerry Rosmarin (deceased) and Marty Rosmarin. Almost as passionate about skiing as she was about her family, Betty had planned a winter trip to Utah in early December. She was a guten neshummah, the radiant center of love and energy around which her extended family revolved. All who met her were infused by her glowing spirit and compassion. She lived life according to her credo, ''everything's good, right?''
