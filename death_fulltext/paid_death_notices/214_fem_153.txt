        ZACHARY--Ruth. It is with great sadness that the family and friends of Ruth Zachary mark her passing on November 19. She was a beloved mentor to all of us. Ruth and her late husband Danny were parents to friends and family. Their generosity and warmth supported us in fulfilling our dreams. Ruth exemplified what is best of NYC in the Westside. She loyally supported her mother at Winters Market on Third Avenue, a noted NYC institution. She amazed family and friends with her love of tennis, playing until almost 90. She was preceded in death by her beloved husband Danny and brother Martin. She is survived by three nieces, her special cousin Jan and his family, her companion Gina, great-nephews (and greatgreat Zachary) and greatnieces, and dear friends.
