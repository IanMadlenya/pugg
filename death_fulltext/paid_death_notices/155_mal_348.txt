        BECKLEY-James E. The Public Investors Arbitration Bar Association (''PIABA'') is sad to announce the death of our current President, James E. Beckley. Jim Beckley, a distinguished attorney from Chicago, worked tirelessly for the protection of individual investors, and he will be missed by our members, and all who shared his commitment, his sense of history, and his sense of humor.
