        BROD-Carol. We at The Psychoanalytic Center of Northern New Jersey, PCNJ, send our deepest condolences to Carol Brod's family. As fellow psychoanalysts, we knew her as a colleague with whom we worked to advance The Modern Psychoanalytic movement. She was a founder of The Brooklyn Seminars in Modern Psychoanalysis, and worked tirelessly to further the goals of The Center For Modern Psychoanalytic Studies. In New Jersey we also benefited from her enthusiastic committment to the growth of PCNJ. All of us will miss her.
        BROD-Carol, Ph.D. The Center for Modern Psychoanalytic Studies sadly mourns the passing of Dr. Carol Brod, Beloved Trustee, Dean, faculty member and friend. Her tireless efforts and her myriad contributions on so many levels will be fondly remembered and sorely missed by the entire CMPS community. Our hearts go out to Ernie and her children. Phyllis W. Meadow, Ph.d, Chair, CMPS Board of Trustees on behalf of the CMPS Community
