        THOMPSON--James ''Dickie'' The beloved jazz guitarist died Thursday, February 22, 2007, in Tucson, Arizona. He is survived by his sons, Peter, Marc and Craig; daughters-inlaw, Ann and Arlynne; seven grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren, living on both the ''Mainland'' and Hawaii; pre-deceased by his loving wife, Bette and daughter, Pat. Dickie at 89 was still making his wonderful music until he suffered a mild stroke in August of last year. To watch and listen to this selftaught left-handed musician playing on a right-hand strung guitar was captivating. His musical career spanned early ''shake dances'', jazz from the 40s to the 60s, touring 5 years with the legendary R&B Jackie Wilson, performing for 12 years in Hawaii with Don Ho, jazz with Wild Bill Davis throughout Europe and then 16 years of gigs after he ''retired'' in Tucson. Dickie was also a gifted artist. His art was a sophisticated, unusual, and highly detailed style that combined drawing, painting, collage, and montage. A remarkable talent is gone. A memorial service will be held at Adair Avalon Chapel, 8090 N. Northern Avenue, Tucson, Arizona, on Saturday, March 10 2007 at 11:00 a.m. In lieu of flowers, donations made to the Tucson Jazz Society, 6262 N Swan Rd, Suite 185, Tucson, AZ 85748 will be greatly appreciated.
