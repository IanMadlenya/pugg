        RUBIN--William. The Sarah Lawrence College community mourns the death of William Rubin, former art history professor and trustee of the College as well as director emeritus of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art. Dr. Rubin, who taught at the College 19521967 and served as a trustee 1979-1986, established art history as a discipline central to Sarah Lawrence's curriculum. The College conferred on him an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree in 2000. We send our deepest sympathy to his wife, Phyllis Hates, and all his family.
