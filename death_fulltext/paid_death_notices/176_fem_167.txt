        MATERA-Barbara. The entire staff and company of American Ballet Theatre honor the memory of Barbara Matera who will be sorely missed by all. Barbara was such an important part of the ABT family and her artistry, dedication and love of the theatre are irreplaceable. Barbara's memory will live on everytime the curtains goes up on an ABT production and for that we are eternally grateful. Thank you for sharing your love of life and the theatre with all of us. Our love and best wishes to Arthur and Jared, as well as Barbara's family and staff.
