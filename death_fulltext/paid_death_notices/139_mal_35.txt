        LAUFER-Simon. Beloved husband of Fran. Devoted father of Lottie Morgenstern, Suzie Rozner Fiderer and Gayle Yashar. Cherished grandfather and great grandfather. A Holocaust survivor and true a patriarch, known for his generosity, integrity, cheerfulness, wisdom and business acumen, he was also a philanthropist committed to Jewish causes worldwide. He will be sorely missed by the many lives he touched. We look to carry forth and emulate the legacy Simon brought to our firm as founder and president of Simon Knitwear.
