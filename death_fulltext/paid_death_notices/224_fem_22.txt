        PALTER--Harriet R. June 1, 1925-September 1, 2005. Last night, in my arms, you left us to begin a new journey. There never was another like you. 59 years and 7 months we lived, worked and loved together. You were always there for me and I for you. God love you and protect you till eternity. Harriet, as a youngster, was a championship horseback rider, attended the Dalton School, graduated from Miss Semple's classes. She attended NYU and Cornell and later, after her boys were grown, joined me in business and became the color stylist for Bruno Magli Women's Shoes in America. Always a great friend to all; kind, compassionate and helpful. Truly one of a kind. Godspeed and rest in peace, your Buddy.
