        EISENBERGER--Lotte. On March 23, 2005 at age 87. Born in Vienna, Austria, she emigrated to New York to escape Hitler with her husband, Walter Eisenberger, and her sister and husband Mimi and Theo Klein. Settling in Harrison in 1954, Lotte entered real estate and opened her own office, Lotte Eisenberger Real Estate at the little cottage on the corner of Harrison and Union Avenues ''Right in the Heart of Harrison''. A force in Westchester real estate for a half century, where she helped some families find new homes three and four times over the years, Lotte will be remembered for her special grace, personal touch, and humility. Divorced in 1968, Lotte spent many happy years with her companion, colleague and second husband Al Conklin, who died in 2000. She will be missed by all who knew her, including her former colleagues, her many friends and customers, and her family-her son, Peter Eisenberger, grandson, Nicholas Eisenberger, his wife Robin, and Al's children, Candida, Victoria and Geoffrey. A public memorial reception will be held on Sunday, April 3 from 4:30--6:30 pm at Wain wright House, 260 Stuyvesant Ave., Rye, NY. Her family requests that instead of flowers you send a donation to Habitat for Humanity International, a favorite charity of Lotte's.
