        GRUNAUER-Phyllis. Of New York, NY, on December 3, 1999. Beloved relative, friend and teacher. Mrs. Grunauer, a lifelong champion of human rights, served in the Human Resources Administration of NYC for many years. Thereafter, she taught at Touro College, where she was the acting head of the Sociology Department until her retirement. Few people have had such a profoundly positive impact on so many. She will be sorely missed by her loving family and all who had the pleasure and honor of knowing her. Memorial services on Sunday at 1PM at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 W. 76th. Shiva will be observed on December 6 and 7 from 5-8PM at Mrs. Grunauer's home. In lieu of flowers, donations would be appreciated to The Women's International League for Peace and Freedom or The Committee on International Human Rights Inquiry.
