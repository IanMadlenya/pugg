        GRUBER--Samuel. 1913-2006. We, the family of Samuel Gruber, will love and miss him forever. He was a wonderful husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather. He lived his life with humility and dignity. He was an underground fighter in Poland against Nazism and wrote the book, ''I Chose Life.'' Israel was his passion and he had many friends there. He leaves his wife Judith, sons Jack and Mark, three grandchildren and four greatgrandchildren.
