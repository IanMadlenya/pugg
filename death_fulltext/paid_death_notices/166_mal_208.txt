        HATCH-William B. Of Washington, DC, Vancouver, BC and Portland, OR. Died November 15, 2000 after a four month struggle with lung disease. Bill spent many years at the Republican Policy Committee of the Senate in the days of Senators Dirkson and Hickenlooper, but his most important work was as a 24 year member of AA. His words of wisdom, encouragement and acceptance helped countless other members, as they also helped him with his sobriety. Lovingly remembered by his daughter Sybil and son-inlaw David Hopkins (Fargo) and grandchildren, Rose, (Washington, DC), Alayne, (St. Paul) and Connor (Fargo). Friends are encouraged to remember Bill in their own way. In lieu of flowers, memorials can be sent to Silent Unity, 1901 N.W. Blue Parkway, Unity Village, MO 64065-0001.
