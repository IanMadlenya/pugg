        ETTMAN--Ruth. The Board of Directors of New York's Finest Foundation extends our condolences to Rodney Ettman, our founder and Chairman Emeritus, on the death of his wife Ruth. They walked hand-in-hand through the best and worst life had to offer. She was just as much a part of us as is Rod. We have lost our most beautiful booster. Our sympathy to all who loved her. The Board of Directors of New York's Finest Foundation
        ETTMAN--Ruth. Rodney: for so many years you had a loving, loyal, caring partner walking beside you. While no one can take the place of Ruth, we want you to know you'll never walk alone. Helen and Hank Seiden
