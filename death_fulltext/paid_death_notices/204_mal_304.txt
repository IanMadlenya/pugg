        KATZ--Sheldon C. Its with a heavy heart that I say farewell to my employer and most of all my dear friend. Your courage and spirit is what I will carry with me into the future. My heart is broken for your wife Deana, your children, grandchildren and the entire Katz family. I know that all of you will find strength from each other due to the incredible love and closeness you have for each other. This is the legacy that both Sheldon and his brother Leon left for all of you. God bless the entire Katz family. Marc Sandau (Private Nurse) Sheldon C. Katz, January 1990-January 2004
