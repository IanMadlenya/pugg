        BYARS-James Lee, internationally renowned artist whose work concentrated on minimal hermetic forms, reduction towards essence and absence, and an acute sense of the ephemeral, died on Thursday, May 23, 1997, at the Anglo-American hospital in Cairo, Egypt. He was 65 years old and his primary residence was in Santa Fe, New Mexico. He is survived by his wife Gwendolyn F. Dunaway of Santa Fe, New Mexico and two step daughters, Gwendolyn D. West of Houston, Texas and Jorie M. Waterman of Santa Fe, New Mexico. A memorial service will be announced at a later date.
