        CHAPMAN--Carolyn. 61, died at her home, Bellport, LI, NY, on August 12, 2004. She will be greatly missed and deeply mourned by her colleagues in the Department of Biology of Suffolk County Community College, Selden, NY, of which she had been a member since 1971. Professor Chapman was a dedicated teacher, ever-helpful to her students. She was amiable, incisive, and diligent in all of the department's affairs, latterly being assistant department head. Dr. Chapman also served on the Board of the Brookhaven Open Space Council, a local environmental group, reflecting her interest in wildlife conservation. The Biology Department extends its sympathy to her father, two sisters, two daughters, and her five grandchildren.
