        LEHNER-Daniel A. The Dowling College family was profoundly saddened by the passing of Daniel A. Lehner, our friend, colleague, and fellow trustee. Mr. Lehner's commitment to higher education and his dedication as a member of a number of Board of Trustees Committees and recipient of the 1994 Presidential Tribute Award will long be remembered. His keen insight and first-hand experience in the field of transportation enriched the growth and reputation of The National Aviation and Transportation Center. Mr Lehner's dedication, support for numerous initiatives, scholarships, and his active involvement in volunteer programs will serve as a continuing legacy for us all. Our deepest condolences to his wife, Remy, and family. Scott Rudolph Chairman of the Board Victor P. Meskill, Ph.D. President Dowling College Long Island, New York
