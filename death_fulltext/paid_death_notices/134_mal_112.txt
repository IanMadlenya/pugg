        KASIN-Edwin, MD. The William Alanson White Psychoanalytic Institute and the William Alanson White Psychoanalytic Society note with irreparable sorrow, the death of a much revered graduate and member. As a Training and Supervising Analyst, and a Faculty member, Dr. Kasin inspired generations of psychoanalysts to whom he imparted the essentials of their profession. His erudite and scholarly teachings were more than matched by the grace, gentility, gladness, and tender humanity which Dr. Kasin demonstrated by example. Our heartfelt condolences to the family that he adored. We shall all miss him. Marylou Lionells, Ph.D., Director, White Institute Allison Stern Rosen, Ph.D., President, White Society
