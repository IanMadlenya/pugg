        BYERS--Fred C. Jr. Fred Byers (also known to his many friends and family members as ''Twig'') passed away Friday, July 28, 2006, at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center after a six year battle with leukemia. He was 51 years old. Born in Kansas City, Missouri, to Joyce Morrison Byers and the late Fred C. Byers, he graduated from the Pembroke Country Day School, Harvard College, and the University of Virginia Law School. Fred had a distinguished legal career in New York City. He first worked at LeBoeuf, Lamb, Leiby & MacRae and later joined Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe, where he was a partner in the corporate department, focusing primarily on corporate finance. Fred was deeply devoted to his family and friends, was active in his church, Saint James' Church, was an antique toy car enthusiast, and was a lifelong fan of all things Kansas City, including the hapless Kansas City Royals, the ''always in contention, never taking home the title'' Kansas City Chiefs, and fried chicken and barbecue. Fred leaves his beloved wife Charlotte (Tweedie) and children Grace Margaret and James Bryson, all of New York City; his mother, Joyce Byers, of Kansas City, Missouri; his sister, Gail Byers Freidin, of New Haven, Vermont; and numerous nieces and nephews. A funeral service will be held on Friday, August 4, at 11 am, at Saint James' Church, 865 Madison Avenue, New York City. In lieu of flowers, donations to the charities of your choice would be appreciated.
