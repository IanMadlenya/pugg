        PERLS-Amelia. It is with deep sadness that The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourns the passing of our treasured benefactor and friend Dolly Perls. With her husband, Klaus G. Perls, she was a collector and a gallery owner for more than 60 years, and their great generosity took the form of two breathtaking gifts to The Metropolitan Museum. In 1991 they donated their African collection of royal art from the kingdom of Benin, an assemblage of 153 objects including cast bronze sculpture and works in carved ivory. And in 1996, they gave The Museum a collection of exceptional paintings by School of Paris artists such as Picasso, Modigliani, and Leger, comprising one of the most important gifts of 20th-century art ever given to The Metropolitan. These gifts of historic importance will be seen and appreciated by museum visitors today and in future generations. We extend our deep condolences to Klaus Perls and the entire family.
