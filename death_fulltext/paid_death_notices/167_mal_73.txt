        BRONFMAN-Jerry. We mourn the loss of a wonderful, bright, funny, warm friend who we will always remember very fondly. Jerry didn't have a mean bone in his body and was always the quickest to make the best and most creative practical joke. His humor helped us all throughout his illness. God bless his family.
