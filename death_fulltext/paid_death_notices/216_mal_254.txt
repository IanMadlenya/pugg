        FEINER--Arthur H., Ph.D., ABPP. The William Alanson White Psychoanalytic Institute and Society profoundly mourn the death of a much celebrated and influential graduate and colleague, Fellow Emeritus, Senior Editor Emeritus of the journal, ''Contemporary Psychoanalysis,'' Training and Supervising Analyst, and faculty member. A psychoanalyst for 45 years, Art was a poet, lyricist and editor of the Journal for an unprecedented 25 years. During this tenure, and with indefatigable energy and an unwavering commitment and scholarly excellence, Art established the Journal as the open-minded, curious, multitheoretical flagship publication that it is today. Dr. Feiner brought vision, passion and an engaging and feisty frankness to his many pursuits, and his brilliant and hilarious musical lampoons of the Institute brought joy and mirth to numerous Institute graduations. The author of many articles on psychoanalysis, Arthur co-edited the classic work, ''Countertransference and the Anxiety of Influence,'' and recently published his book, ''Interpersonal Psychoanalytic Perspectives on Relevance, Dismissal and Self-Definition.'' Dr. Feiner left an enduring legacy. We shall yearn for his largerthan-life inspiring presence among us and we shall miss him always. Our deep condolences to Alice Feiner, his beloved wife of 60 years, and to his dear family, friends, colleagues and patients.
