        BOGIN-Ruth (nee Fleischer). Suddenly, on April 30, 1999. Loving wife of the late George Bogin, beloved mother of Magda and Nina (Alain Buttard), adored grandmother of Cecilia and Valentine Buttard and Natasha Bogin. Lifelong friend. We are bereft, but will draw strength from her deepest qualities: her brilliant mind, her integrity and optimism, her commitment to a better world, her joy in life. Memorial service Thursday, May 6, 11:30 AM, at New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street.
