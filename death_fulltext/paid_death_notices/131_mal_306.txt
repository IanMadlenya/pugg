        NARKISS-Uzi. The National Board of Hadassah, WZOA, mourns the death of General (Res.) Uzi Narkiss, the Israeli Army general who liberated Mt. Scopus during the 1967 Six Day War, enabling Hadassah to regain our abandoned medical facilities. May his memory be for a blessing. Marlene E. Post, Nat'l President
