        VALENTI--Jack. The Board of Trustees and staff of the Aspen Institute mourn the loss of our friend and valued Board member Jack Valenti. Mr. Valenti joined the Aspen Institute Board in 2002, working on program and marketing strategies. He was treasured for his political savvy and inimitable spirit. Our deepest condolences go to his wife, Mary Margaret; their daughters Courtenay and Alexandra; their son, John; and their two grandchildren.
