        MERRILL-Helen. The officers, board of directors and staff of Dramatists Play Service mourn the passing of our esteemed friend and colleague. Helen was a devoted member of the Board of Directors of the Play Service for many years. We will miss her and her incredible theatre knowledge, uncanny instinct for new talent and sly sense of humor, not to mention her memorable accent. We express our deep sympathy to her family, friends and clients. Dramatists Play Service Stephen Sultan, President
