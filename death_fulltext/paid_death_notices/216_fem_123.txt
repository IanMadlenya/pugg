        BLOCH--Dorothy, M.A. On January 13, on her 93rd birthday. A lifelong New Yorker, Ms. Bloch was an educator and certified psychologist who practiced on the Upper West Side as a child psychoanalyst for nearly 40 years, as well as spending many wonderful summers in her home on Martha's Vineyard. As an active member of the psychoanalytic community, she trained therapists at NPAP and the Manhattan Center for Psychonanalytic Studies. Her book, ''So the Witch Won't Eat Me: Fantasy and The Child's Fear of Infanticide'' (1978), was credited with moving forward the discussion of children's fears. She is survived by her two beloved sisters, Jeannette and Edna, her family, and many friends and colleagues. In recent years she was especially close to her dear friends Dr. Kathryn May and Dr. Irene Runge. Contributions in her name may be sent to the African support organization DATA, 1317 F. St. NW, Washington, DC 20004.
