        PIEL--Gerard. The Board of Managers of The New York Botanical Garden mourns the passing of Honorary Manager, Gerard Piel. Gerry served on The Garden's Board with distinction for nearly three decades, 1971-1998, and since then, as an Honorary Board Member. Of his many volunteer assignments on the Board, among the most important was his leadership of the Botanical Science Committee, which he chaired for many years. We will miss Gerry's devotion to the Gardens' International Plant Science Center, and his wisdom, humor, generosity, and the clarity and facility with which he was able to humanize the language of science. Our warmest condolences go out to his wife, Eleanor Jackson Piel, their two children, Eleanor Womack, and Jonathan Piel, and their families. Wilson Nolen, Chairman Thomas J. Hubbard, Chairman Emeritus Gregory Long, President and CEO
