He was the devoted son of the late Harry and Etta Gordon and brother to Seymour. Lawrence is survived by his loving wife Janet and their children, Wendy, Scott, Peter and Petula, and from a previous marriage, daughter Kathy and grandson Eric. A decorated World War II veteran and a pioneer of industry, he was Chairman of the Board and CEO of Lehigh Valley Industries and Blue Ridge Winkler Textiles, among other Fortune 500 companies. Lawrence was a loving, charismatic, brilliant, dynamic, creative and adventurous man, and a champion golfer. Our lives have been blessed by his honor, integrity and love. He was a loving husband, father, colleague and friend, and he will be deeply missed by all who have known him. As Lord Tennyson wrote: ''Love is the only gold.''
