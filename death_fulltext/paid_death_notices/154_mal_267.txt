        HAMMERMAN-Bernard. On November 19, 1999. Born July 15, 1923. Devoted son of the late Louis and Rose Hammerman. Loving husband of Joan; father of Darcy (Allen), Brett (Dana) and Robert (Wendy). Adoring grandfather of Harley, Jeremy, Sloane and Maris. Precious brother of Ben (Lorelei), Goldie (Norman), David (Sarah) and the late Hyman (Florence). Caring uncle to his nephews and nieces and their children. Bernie was a purple heart veteran of World War II. At the end of 1945, with his brothers, he started the family business which proudly continues. With the passage of years, Bernie formed a multitude of friendships with reciprocal loyalties. He was generous of spirit and substance. He lived his life by the Golden Rule, with great pride in his heritage. He was respected and loved by all of his friends, employees and family. We are all truly bereaved and pray that we may find solace in his blessed memory. Family will be sitting shiva at the Hammerman residence, 980 5th Avenue, New York City. The Hammerman Family
