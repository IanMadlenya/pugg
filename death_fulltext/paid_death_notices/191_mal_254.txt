        ROSENFELD-Stanley Zachary. Born July 27, 1913. Died December 23, 2002. He is survived by his wife, Heather Hanley, his sons, Richard Morris Rosenfeld and Jonathan Eliot Rosenfeld, two daughters-in-law, Margaret Andersen and Joan Prudic, a brother William, and a world of sailors, photographers, and lovers of the sea, wind and light. His first wife, Ruth Helen Landesman Rosenfeld predeceased him in 1979. Although he will be greatly missed, his life's work leaves a photographic legacy-images that live on and inspire all who see them. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests that contributions be made to: The Rosenfeld Collection at Mystic Seaport Museum, 75 Greenmanville Ave., Mystic, CT. 06355.
