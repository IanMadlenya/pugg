        MAYRO-Jordan. Born November 30, 1929 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, died December 7, 1999. Many friends and cousins mourn his passing. He called friend Elaine Berger his ''sister.'' Jerry's Burlington Bookshop on Madison Avenue near the Metropolitan Museum was a book lover's haven. Jerry was that rare human being that people instinctively liked. He was a compassionate man with a big heart. He enjoyed good conversation. Chesterton said ''there is a great deal of difference between an eager man who wants to read a book and the tired man who wants a book to read.'' Jerry knew the difference. Interment will be private in Philadelphia Friday, December 10, 1999. A Memorial service in New York City for friends and family will be held at Frank E. Campbell Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street, New York City, on Friday December 17, 1999 at 4PM. Donations may be made to your favorite charity. Friends & Cousins
