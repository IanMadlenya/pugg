        CURCIO--Frank P. On September 7, 2006. Born and raised in his beloved Brooklyn, he was a man who loved life. A wonderful cook, gifted artist, an avid collector and a die-hard Yankee and Ranger fan, he knew how to live life to the fullest. Outspoken and passionate about so many things, he was one of a kind. Our hearts are broken and we will miss him terribly. He is survived by his wife Jo, his children Paola and Dominic, his grandchildren Matthew and Elizabeth and his brother Joe. Visitation at Martin A. Gleason Funeral Home, Saturday and Sunday, 2:00-5:00 and 7:00-9:00 P.M. at 10-25 150 St, Whitestone, NY (718) 3596300, Mass at St. Luke's Church, Whitestone, NY, 10:15 A.M., Monday.
