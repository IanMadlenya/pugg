        MATOS--Irving. The Board of Directors, Administration, Faculty, Parents and Students of the Hebrew Academy of Nassau County extend their deepest sympathy to the family of Irving Matos ''Yitzchak Pincos ben Moshe Leib.'' Mr. Matos was a former HANC parent, vice president of the Board of Directors and a long-time friend of HANC. He played a pivotal role in HANC's formative years and maintained a steadfast working involvement with the school throughout his lifetime. His humility and wisdom will be missed. May the family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Rabbi Meyer Fendel, Dean Emeritus Rabbi Moshe Gottesman, Dean Emeritus Lillian Borofsky, President Mark Nathanson, Chairman of the Board
