        HUET-Jean. The Board of Trustees and staff of Carnegie Hall mourn the sudden passing of Jean Huet, a Co-Chair of our Corporate Fund since 1993 and a longstanding patron of Carnegie Hall. We will miss his good humor and his steadfast support of great music. Our condolences go to his family and to his colleages at Societe Generale. Isaac Stern, President Sanford I. Weill, Chairman Franz Xaver Ohnesorg, Executive Director
