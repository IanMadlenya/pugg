        SIMPSON--Mary McEldowney. The President and Board of Trustees of Vassar College note with deepest sorrow the passing of Mary McEldowney Simpson, beloved wife of the late Alan Simpson, Vassar President from 1964 to 1977. Mary Simpson's wisdom, wit, and generosity and her devotion to the College will stand in the memory of all who knew her. She touched the College and so many of us in simply extraordinary ways. As an institution and as individuals, we are very grateful for her service and friendship. We extend our condolences to her daughters Barbara and Carol, grandchildren Mary Kathleen Flynn, Vassar Class of 1984, and Kevin Flynn, and the rest of her family and many friends. Richard E. Van Demark Chair, Board of Trustees Frances D. Fergusson President
