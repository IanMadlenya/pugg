        RUDERFER--Lenny. More than 180 members of the Gezunter Men's Club of the Sid Jacobson JCC mourn the passing of our beloved Founder and Chairman. Lenny was a fabulous, one-of-a-kind ''mensch.'' At our meeting celebrating his 90th birthday, he danced, joked and ''tummeled'' with the heart of a showman. We are grateful to have shared part of his long, productive life. The benefits of his many good deeds live on. Our love and condolences to his devoted children Mindy, Dean, their families and his sister Phyllis. Bob Lippet, President Jerry Kroll, Vice President
        RUDERFER--Leonard. Dear friend, fellow Gezunter. Lenny was an extraordinary man who brought joy to all who knew him. He was loved dearly by all of his old and new friends and most of all his beloved fellow Gezunters. His smile will always be with us. Bernard Zises & family
