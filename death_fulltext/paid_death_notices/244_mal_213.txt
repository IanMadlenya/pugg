        GLYNN--Eugene David, M.D., psychiatrist and art critic, died on May 15, 2007, of lung cancer. He was 81. The son of Isidore Glynn and Tillie Sheinbaum, he was born in Passaic, NJ, and raised by his stepmother, Frieda Helman. A WWII Naval veteran, he attended college and medical school at NYU. He devoted his life to public health in New York, counseling patients, supervising psychiatric care and training social workers. He was the Director of Clinical Services at the Youth Counseling League and a consulting psychiatrist for the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services. Dr. Glynn had an abiding love for the arts. His writings on psychoanalysis and art were published in Art News and The Print Collector's Newsletter. His description of Adrian Stokes reads like a self-portrait: ''the passion for art, the intensity of concern, the almost raw hyperactive quality of a sensibility that threatens at times to engulf all else -the nature is a 19th century one determined to order itself by the 20th century's monumental new view, psychoanalysis.'' He is survived by his partner of fifty years, Maurice Sendak, and his sister Muriel Newman. Friends wishing to honor Dr. Glynn are asked to contribute to the American Cancer Society.
