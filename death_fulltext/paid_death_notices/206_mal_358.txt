        STAVSKY--Rabbi David. The entire Yeshiva University community, and its affiliate Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary, mourn the passing of Rabbi David Stavsky, a distinguished Jewish communal leader who served his congregation, Beth Jacob Congregation in Columbus, Ohio for more than 46 years. An alumnus of Yeshiva College, he was ordained by the University's seminary and served as a chaplain in the US Army. A former national vice president of the Rabbinical Council of America, he was the recipient of numerous awards for his dedication and leadership in Jewish education. Heartfelt condolences are extended to Ruth, and their children: Joel, Chanita, Averim, Jordan, and Seth, and their fifteen grandchildren. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel, President Norman Lamm, Chancellor Ronald P. Stanton, Chairman YU Board of Trustees Julius Berman, Chairman RIETS Board of Trustees
