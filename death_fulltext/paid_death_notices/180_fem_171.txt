        SCHNEIDER-Lorraine. The members of the East Midtown Coalition for Sensible Development express sorrow on the death of Lorraine Schneider. We appreciated Lorraine's significant contributions to EMCSD, especially as Corresponding Secretary. Lorraine devoted her life to the well-being of her community, and her passing is a loss to us all.
