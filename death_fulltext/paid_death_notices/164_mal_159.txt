        SMITH-Gerald Morton. It is with sorrow that we note the passing of Gerald Morton Smith, a longtime partner of our predecessor firm Gottesman Wolgel Smith and Secunda who enriched the law and lives of those who labored with and learned from him. We send our deepest sympathies to his wife, Lorraine and his family. Gottesman Wolgel Secunda Malamy and Flynn P.C.
