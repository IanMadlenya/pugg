The Board of Trustees of The Heckscher Foundation for Children mourn the passing of our extraordinary Trustee, Bill Hart, who served with distinction on our Board for over 37 years. His wise counsel, judgement and commitment to the welfare of children and families in need will be missed by all of our Board and by the thousands of people whose lives he touched. Our condolences go out to Jeanie and the entire Hart family. Virginia Sloane, President Heckscher Foundation for Children
