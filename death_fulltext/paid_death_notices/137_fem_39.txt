        STICKNEY-Dorothy. The Zonta Club of New York mourns the passing of Dorothy Stickney, member of our organization for forty one years. As an individual and esteemed actress, she exemplified our object of advancing the status of women worldwide. ''We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life is rounded with a sleep.''
        STICKNEY - Dorothy. Dearest Dorothy, neither words nor tears can truly express how important you have been in my life. May you find peace and know that you will always be ''A Lovely Light'' to Christine, Katie and me. Love Richard
