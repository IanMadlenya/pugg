        RICH-Gordon. With great sorrow, we learned of the passing of our new friend, colleague and group co-head. Obvious to us even in the short time we knew him was that his role as a manager and mentor was invaluable; he easily won the admiration of clients and colleagues alike; his enthusiasm was infectious. We were unfairly robbed of the opportunity to achieve great things together. We will miss you, friend. The DLJ Media & Communications Group
