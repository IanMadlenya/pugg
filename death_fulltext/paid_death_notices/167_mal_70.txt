        WIENER-Don, whose business career as a finance and administrative executive spanned a period of over 30 years, died November 30 at home in New York City. With him was Gloria, his wife of 47 years, who was also his ''best friend'', and their cat, Hrothgar. Prior to retirement, he was Director of Administration with the law firm of Hughes Hubbard & Reed for 15 years. He began his career with Ford Motor Company in the 1950's in Detroit and subsequently entered the advertising agency business, concentrating his talents in administrative operations, including earnings policies, employee benefit programs and cost-effective billing and purchasing procedures. As Vice President of Administration and Finance with a major agency in New York, he authored articles and spoke on the subject of agency profit plans. During World War II, he was in Army Intelligence and Operations in the European Theatre, landing in Normandy on D Day plus 6. He held an M.A. from Stanford University, a BA from UCLA and a Rockefeller Fellowship at Kenyon College. He was an avid birder and a lover of nature, literature and the arts. He especially enjoyed cross-country skiing and being a ''part-time Catskill beekeeper'' at his upstate New York country home. His favorite ''toy'' there is a 1942 Allis Chalmers tractor which he used to mow the fields and keep the road to the house clear of snow in the winter. Besides his wife, he is survived by his sister, Faye Subrin, his brother, Jack Wiener, four nieces and two nephews, all California residents, and a multitude of friends. No service is planned.
