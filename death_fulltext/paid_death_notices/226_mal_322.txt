        ETKIN--Alex J. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) mourn the loss of Alex J. Etkin of Detroit, whose six decades of devotion to our organization stand as a beacon of unflagging support. He served in multiple leadership positions, including on the ATS Board of Directors, Board of Regents, and as vice president of the Detroit Chapter. In 2000, his son Douglas established the annual Alex J. Etkin Young Leadership Award in his honor to encourage new chapter leaders. Together with his wife, Toby, Mr. Etkin established academic chairs and the A.J. Etkin International Seminar on Strategic Planning in Construction at the Technion. The annual seminar was an outgrowth of Mr. Etkin's successful career in construction, having developed some of Detroit's most important buildings. A Technion Guardian who reached the highest level of support for Israel, the Technion and the ATS, Mr. Etkin was awarded an honorary fellowship from the Technion in 1995. We extend our condolences to his wife Toby, sons Douglas and Bruce Etkin, daughter Barbra Alter, and the entire Etkin family. American Society for Technion-Israel Institute of Technology Stephen A.
