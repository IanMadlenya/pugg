Dr. Gee was Chief Neoplastic Hematopoietic Services at Saint Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center.

Dr. Gee was truly a dedicated, gifted physician, an exemplary teacher, and a loyal friend to all of us. We offer our profound condolences to his wife, Carol, his children, and all of his extended family and friends. John S.
