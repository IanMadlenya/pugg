        STIEFEL-Ernst C. The entire New York Law School community mourns the loss of Dr. Ernst C. Stiefel, a man of great intellect, compassion and wit. We are deeply indebted to him for his many generous gifts to the School, including the restoration of the Ernst Steifel Reading Room and his endowment of a Professorship in Comparative Law. He served as an adjunct professor for twenty years at the School and inspired generations of NYLS students by his example. He will be missed.
