        FETTER--Ida Rebecca. At age 85, after 62 wonderful years of marriage to husband Norman, Ida finally left this earth, a victim of Alzheimer's disease. She will be sorely missed by all who knew her because she was a beautiful person both inside and out. She spent a lifetime of service to the community and in 1986 she was honored by the East Meadow section of the National Council of Jewish Women as their first Woman of the Year. She often spoke fondly of her days at the Shady Grove Hotel, owned by her mother in Ferndale, NY. She is survived by her husband Norman, her two boys, Barry of Ormond Beach, FL, and David of Highland Park, IL. Barry is married to Monique and David to Fay. Her two grandchildren are Joanna and Marissa. Services will be at the I.J. Morris Funeral Home in Hempstead, NY, on Sunday, at 1 PM. May she rest in peace.
