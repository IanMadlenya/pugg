        MATISSE-Maria-Gaetana. In two acts of extraordinary generosity, Tana gave Henry Street lovely Matisse drawings to silently auction at The Art Show and help fill our coffers. Even more generously, she gave us the pleasure of her company and her irreplaceable friendship. She was like no one we knew and we will miss her. The Henry Street Settlement
