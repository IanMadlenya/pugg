        BOHER-Gertrude, age 86, passed away peacefully in the early hours of Sunday, February 16, 1997. Gertrude was a true New Yorker where she lived all her life until the last few years when she joined her sister, Helen, in Studio City, California. Born on May 12, 1910 in Jackson Heights, a graduate of Barnard College, she worked at Mutual Broadcasting until her retirement. Interested in all that the city had to offer, she became a true patron of the arts, Philharmonic, and museums. She is survived by her loving sister, Helen, her niece, Wendy, and her nephew, Christopher. We will miss her love, interest, and inquisitive mind.
