        RAMOS-Paul. The Ryan Community Health Network is deeply saddened by the sudden loss of Paul Ramos. For the past two decades, we worked together in the struggle to provide affordable, quality health services to our patients. He was a tireless advocate for the underserved in our communities. Our hearts go out to Roni and his daughters, and everyone at Betances. He will be missed. Julio Bellber Barbra Minch Kathy Gruber
