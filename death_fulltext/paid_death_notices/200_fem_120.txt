        YEE - DILLON -- Cybill. On September 12, 2003 at age 27. Her family at York Capital Management extends our sincere sympathy to her ever loyal husband Gurdev, her mom Mary, her father Cy, her brother Carlton, her sister Cherise, brother-in-law Danny, nephew Conrad, and niece Sophia. She was sweet, kind, thoughtful, loving, and brave. Cybill added to all our lives, and will always be with us in our thoughts and prayers. She was loved by all.
