        FROSBERG--Solomon Richard. The Yeshiva University family is saddened to learn of the recent passing in Baltimore of the beloved brother of Mrs. Abby Belkin, wife of the late lamented second president of Yeshiva University, Dr. Samuel Belkin, of blessed memory. He is also survived by his son, Mark Frosberg of Baltimore, and his brother, E. Milton Frosberg, of San Diego, CA. He had rendered heroic service as a merchant marine officer. May the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel, President Norman Lamm, Chancellor Morry Weiss, Chairman Board of Trustees
