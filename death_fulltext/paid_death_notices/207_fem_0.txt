        GREENE--Jean. Died Saturday, March 27th. Born April 15, 1910. Loving, kind, generous, funny. A true New Yorker born and bred. Lived in every neighborhood of Manhattan. From the Model T to the digital age she always kept up with the times. A most generaous spirit who loved her family and was able to share family wisdom, love and humor with her daughter Jenny, son-in-law Bill, grandchildren Cody and Rachel, sister Muriel, her not forgotten brother Bernie, nephews Cliff and Roger and niece Vicki and stepson Andy and numerous friends and neighbors. She will live in our spirits and we will miss her. A memorial service will be held in the near future.
