        GOLDMAN-Sol Isaye. On June 30. Beloved and loving husband to Martha, devoted father of Richard, Robert, and Scott, cherished grandfather of Benjamin, Emily, Jason, and Andrew. Sol spread his kindness generously to all who met him; helping, teaching, and sharing. He founded and was President of Goldman Fire Prevention Corporation for over 40 years, the city's leading firm for testing of fire sprinkler systems. Served as President and Board Member of The Executives Association of Greater NY. Upon retirement, he volunteered and created exhibits at The NY City Fire Museum. A master craftsman of wood in his spare time. WW II veteran. We will all miss his warmth.
