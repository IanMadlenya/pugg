        WAGNER--Rodney B. on March 24, 2005 in FL surrounded by his loving wife and children. The Population Council mourns the passing of Mr. Wagner, member of the Board of Trustees since 1996 and Chairman since 2001. Mr. Wagner was exceptionally thoughtful and generous and was a forceful advocate for improving reproductive health and rights. Mr. Wagner was deeply committed to improving the lives of poor families in developing countries, and also served on the boards of the World Wildlife Fund, American University in Beirut and Lewis Preston Education Fund for Girls. Population Council staff and trustees will miss his wisdom and positive spirit very much. Our deepest sympathies to the Wagner family. P. Donaldson, Pres. E. McCormack, V. Chair
