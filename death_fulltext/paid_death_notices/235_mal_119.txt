        HICKEY--Frank G., former CEO of General Instrument, died on August 9, in Santa Monica, CA. He is survived by daughter Stephanie. For more than three decades Dad supported efforts to extend life and alleviate suffering including the research of Dr. Robert Jarvik and the humanitarian work of Robert Simon, M.D., founder of International Medical Corp. He raged against death during 10 years of illness and surgery but left this world gently on the afternoon of his 79th birthday. May he now enjoy the peace and prosperity that a life of success and struggle did not provide.
