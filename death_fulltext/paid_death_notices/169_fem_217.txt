        FRIEDMAN-Eva. Of Forest Hills, NY. On February 23, 2001. Beloved widow after 52 years of marriage to Lou. Devoted mother to Adele Vivien Friedman Newman and cherished mother-in-law of Robert Newman. Loving sister of Yetta Banks and sister-in-law to Sol Banks, aunt and great-aunt to numerous nieces and nephews, both in the United States and in England. Respected leader of Jewish community groups and activities. You were our true ''Yiddishe Mama'', and we loved you more than we can say. Whether a button to sew, a meal to make, a mountain to climb. You did it all unselfishly. You were forever young and so we cannot believe that you are no longer here. With you goes a piece of our heart. Mama, no one could have loved a daughter more, and no daughter could have loved her mother more. Services will be held at Parkside Funeral Home, Queens Boulevard, at 2 PM on Sunday, February 25. Contributions can be made to the Senior Program at the Central Queens YM & YWHA, Forest Hills.
