        SPIEGEL--Edward. The Board members of the Lymphoma Foundation mourn the untimely death of our colleague and dear friend Edward Spiegel on August 8, 2004. Ed served on the Board of the Lymphoma Foundation with a powerful desire to contriubute to cancer research and the related research of neurofibromatosis that could and would save many lives. Ed contributed his compelling energy, his compassionate nature and his personal resources to the Lymphoma Foundation to help so many of his friends, his family and countless anonymous persons who benefited from his generosity. Ed was a pillar of support to his entire family and an extraordinary loving husband and father. We offer our sincere condolences to his wife Deanne and his children Elana and Brad, and want them to know that we are here to offer them any help we might contribute to their well-being during the stress of this immediate time and into the future. Mortimer J. Lacher, M.D. President of the Lymphoma Foundation
