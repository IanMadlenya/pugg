        KARNAM -- Lida, 1967 - 2003. My beloved wife, companion and friend, passed away suddenly on September 11. Lida was born in Iran. Due to religious persecution of Baha'is, she moved to the U.S. and attained a nursing degree. She met her beloved husband, Umaprasanna Karnam, in Florida and they had the most wonderful years of their lives. She is remembered as being uniquely compassionate, loving and caring. She is survived by her husband, Umaprasanna Karnam, MD, her brothers, Houshang and Farhoud, sister Shamsay, and cousins, Sholeh, Rana and Ramin. Lida was interred on September 13 at Mount Olivet Cemetery, SLC, UT.
