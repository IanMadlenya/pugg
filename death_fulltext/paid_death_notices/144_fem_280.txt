        ROSENWALD-Ruth Israels. The Officers, Board of Directors and staff of UJA-Federation of New York are deeply saddened by the passing of Ruth Israels Rosenwald, a cherished friend of the Jewish community. She was the beloved wife of William Rosenwald, a founder of United Jewish Appeal and former President of UJA-Federation, who held virtually every major leadership position in the American Jewish community. Her loving devotion to Mr. Rosenwald was a constant source of strength that inspired his efforts during the later years of his life. Their humanitarian concerns live on in the continuing dedication and leadership of their family. We extend our deepest condolences to her son, Michael Jozef Israels; her daughter-in-law, Maija-Sarmite Jansons; her stepdaughters, Nina Rosenwald, Elizabeth R. Varet and Alice R. Sigelman; her grandchildren; and the entire family. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair James S. Tisch, President Stephen D. Solender, Exec V.P.
