        KAMM--Hedy. Died Friday, August 20. Born in Vienna in 1907, she fled Austria and hid in France during WWII while her husband Henry fought the Nazis with the French Foreign Legion. She helped her parents escape from Austria before she and her husband came to the U.S. in 1941. She had a successful career as a dress designer until she retired at the age of 90. She was a devoted wife, mother and grandmother. She is predeceased by her husband and is survived by her daughter Renee, son-in-law Neal, and two grandchildren, Daniel and Teddy. We love her and will miss her always.
