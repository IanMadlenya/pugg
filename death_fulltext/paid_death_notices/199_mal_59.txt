        SCHILLINGER -- Morton, Ph.D., ABPP. Section V, Psychologist Psychoanalyst Clinicians, of the Division of Psychoanalysis of the American Psychological Association mourns the loss of its president, colleague, leader and friend. Dr. Schillinger gave much to American psychoanalytic psychology; over his long and distinguished career he was its devoted champion and protector. His energy, warmth and generosity will be greatly missed.
