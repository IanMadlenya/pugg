        GILLIATT-Neal. The employees of McCann-Erickson mourn the loss of one of the leaders of our company and our industry. Not only was he a superb businessman, but he traveled the world for us, setting standards for McCannErickson's people and operations. As he said ''Religious values are the key in business. Business is no more than people organized to work. People's values therefore determine the the values of business in our whole society.'' McCann wishes to extend its deepest sympathies and condolences to his wife, family and friends. They are in our thoughts and prayers. A memorial service will be held on Thursday, September 28th, 4PM at Second Congregational Church, 130 E.Putnam Av, Greenwich CT. In lieu of flowers, contributions maybe made to Indiana Unversity. James Heekin, Chairman, CEO
