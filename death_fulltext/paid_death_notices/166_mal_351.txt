        SCHINDLER - Alexander. The Board of Directors and staff of the American Foundation for AIDS Research mourn the loss of our National Council member (since 1993) Rabbi Alexander Schindler, an eminent religious leader, organization executive, author/editor, and advocate for the protection of the rights of all individuals, including, very early on, the rights of those touched by the epidemic of HIV/AIDS. We honor him for his social conscience in denouncing the ban of openly gay individuals in the military. Mathilde Krim, Ph.D. Founding Co-Chair and Chairman of the Board American Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR)
