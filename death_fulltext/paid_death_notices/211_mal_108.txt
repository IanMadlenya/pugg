        SWORTZELL -- Lowell. On August 9, age 74. The Faculty of the Steinhardt School of Education at New York University deeply mourn the loss of Lowell Swortzell, beloved colleague for forty years, and a founder of our Educational Theatre Program. Celebrated author and playwright, revered teacher and gifted scholar. Lowell edited seven books, authored twenty plays, and received a New York Times Outstanding Book of the Year Award for ''All the World's A Stage: Modern Plays for Young People.'' A Fulbright Scholar, he was inducted into the College of Fellows of the American Theatre at the Kennedy Center in 1993. His energy, wit, grace, and passion for theatre will be sorely missed. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Nancy. His family requests donations be made in his memory to the Lowell S. and Nancy Swortzell Graduate Scholarship Fund for Educational Theatre c/o Dawn Duncan, NYU Steinhardt School of Education, 25 West 4th Street, New York, NY 10012.
