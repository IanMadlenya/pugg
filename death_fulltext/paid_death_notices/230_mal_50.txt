        BERK -- Dr. Charles. On March 4, 2006 seven weeks short of his 96th birthday. His wife Helen Goell Berk, with whom he enjoyed 60 years of marital bliss died in 1993. Born in Manhattan but raised in Brooklyn, the two principal loves of his life were his family and the practice of medicine. After graduating at age 22 from the Long Island College of Medicine he conducted a general practice in Brooklyn for 45 years. He moved to Lakehurst, NJ, in 1977, leasing a new office, from which he practiced for an additional nine years. Following his ''real'' retirement in 1996 he moved back to Manhattan. His more than 50 years of private practice were interrupted only for World War II. He enlisted in the Army Medical Corps shortly after Pearl Harbor, rose to the rank of Captain and Company Commander, and led one of the first medical units onto Utah Beach on D-Day. Outside of medicine his life centered on the large, extended Berk/Goell family. Dr. Berk is survived by his youngest sister, Shirley Sherwin of Queens; his two sons, Richard Berk of Seattle and Dr. Paul Berk of New York and his wife, Nicole; grandchildren Claire Ancona-Berk of New York, Philip Berk of Boston, Ted Berk and his wife Naomi Weinberg of London, and David Berk (age threeand-a-half) of New York. He was thrilled by the arrival of great-granddaughter Samantha to Ted and Naomi in London just four weeks ago. Service Sunday 1 PM at ''The Riverside'' 76th St. and Amsterdam Ave.
