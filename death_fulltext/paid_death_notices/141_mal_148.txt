        HELFELD-Irwin. Ohr Torah Stone Colleges and Graduate Programs mourn with sorrow the passing, on Erev Sukkot, of our beloved friend, devoted husband, loving son-in-law, faithful congregant and noble benefactor, Irwin Helfeld. Irwin was a proud son of his People who was deeply committed to the State of Israel, Jewish future and our noble heritage. May his wife Ilse, a most loving and caring life's partner, find comfort among the mourners of Zion and Israel. Shlomo Riskin Chancellor and Dean
