        QUITTMAN-Herman Z. As the recipients of the Herman Z. Quittman Award for Professional Excellence in Jewish Communal Service, we are especially saddened by the passing of this exceptional leader whose commitment to Zionism, Israel, the Jewish people and the U.S. set a standard which we all seek to emulate. To his family and his extended family in Bnai Zion we extend our condolences and pray that they draw comfort from his legacy of service and achievement that benefitted so many.
