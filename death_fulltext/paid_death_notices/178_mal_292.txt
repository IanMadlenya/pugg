        DRADDY-James J. We mourn the passing of our retired Board Chairman, the affable and supremely dedicated Jim Draddy. How he reveled in the ''Miracle of Daytop'' (his words) as once hopeless youngsters emerged as sparkling, highly motivated young men and women. His presence in our lives was a special blessing and his dedication to the cause of recovery unfaltering. Our prayerful support to his beloved Pat and his Family. (Msgr.) William B. O'Brien, Pres. Daytop Village, Inc.
