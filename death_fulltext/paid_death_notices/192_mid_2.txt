        WISE-Ruth. The community of West End Synagogue, a Reconstructionist Congregation, mourns the loss of one of its founding members and officers. A charming woman and 1929 Barnard graduate, Ruth and her husband Leo were attracted to the ''thinking'' nature of Reconstructionism and became pillars of the movement. Our warm sympathies go to their son David, his wife Rita and their sons Warren & Jeffrey. Rabbi Yael Ridberg Cantor Mordechai Schram President Karen Kolodny
