        BROWNBACK-Lewis. 35. His death on March 26, 1999 at Cabrini Hospital has left us all bereft. Known for his unerring taste, determination and loyalty as well as his kindness, playfulness and loving nature. Lewis was insistent in his individuality and in his certainty of purpose. Associated with the Emporium Antique Shop, Ltd., his talent and individuality have given us all inspiration. We love you, will always love you, and you will be missed. Until we meet again.
