        McCANN-Frank. The 125,000 - member Transport Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO deeply mourns the death March 17, 2003 of one of our most beloved union brothers, Frank McCann, who served the TWU membership for 50 years, and the past decade as its Executive Vice President. His luminous career with TWU began as a bus operator in 1953 at the Kingsbridge Depot in the Bronx. He served TWU's largest affiliate, Local 100 in NY for nearly four decades representing NYC's 36,000 transit workers as Shop Steward, Executive Board member, Section Chairman, Depot Chairman, Division Chairman, Staff Representative and Vice President. His passing is a heartbreaking loss to this union and to the thousands of transportation workers whose lives have been immeasurably enhanced by his work. His indefatigable devotion to this union and its membership will never be forgotten, and his countless contributions to TWU members will live on in the form of better wages, benefits and working conditions for generations of transit workers to come. Those who had the privilege to know and work with him at TWU will forever miss his caring friendship and constant good nature. We at TWU offer our most heartfelt sympathy to his family: wife, Joan; sons, Hugh and Frank, Jr.; daughter, Rose Marie McCann - Walters; brother, George; sister, Catherine Reiner; brother-in-law Pete Hassett; son-in-law Kevin Walters; daughters-in-law Jean and Eileen, and grandchildren Tiffany, Kevin, Hugh, John, Danny, Sean and Kelsey.
