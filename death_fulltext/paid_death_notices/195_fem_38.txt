        SUZUKI-Alice. The Union Settlement staff and Board of Directors deeply mourn the loss of Alice Suzuki, 90, the first and longtime director of the Union Washington Community Center, founded in 1956. Born in Los Angeles, Alice was interned with other Japanese-Americans after Pearl Harbor. Thanks in large part to the Religious Society of Friends and to the YWCA, she graduated from UCLA and came East to graduate from the Columbia School of Social Work. She served first at Five Towns Neighborhood Association in Lawrence, L.I. and then at Union Settlement for the remainder of her career. With no children of her own, Alice helped to raise hundreds of East Harlem children. She inspired and trained her staff who in turn have been imaginative and dedicated social workers. She encouraged Raphael Flores, who later became the founder of Hotline Cares. Our warm sympathies to Alice's family. Stuart Mieklejohn, Chairman Ellen Simon, Executive Director
