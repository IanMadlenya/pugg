        PITT-Jane, M.D. The faculty, staff, and students of Columbia University Health Sciences mourn the loss of a dear friend and esteemed colleague, Dr. Jane Pitt. A graduate of Radcliffe College and Harvard Medical School, Dr. Pitt had been a member of the Columbia University Health Sciences community since 1971, most recently serving as professor of clinical pediatrics at Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons and as an attending physician at Children's Hospital of New York at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. In her roles as medical educator, scholar, clinician, and advocate, Dr. Pitt remained deeply and steadfastly committed to improving the health and lives of children, dedicating her life to combating and treating a wide variety of pediatric infectious diseases including pediatric AIDS. In one of her most visible positions at Columbia Health Sciences, Dr. Pitt led the Women's and Children's Care Center at Children's Hospital, providing compassionate care for countless women and children with HIV. We extend our most heartfelt sympathies to her family, including her beloved children Jennifer and Eric. Her tireless and heroic spirit will be missed. Gerald D. Fischbach, M.D. Executive Vice President for Health and Biomedical Sciences and Dean of the Faculty of Medicine Columbia University
