        BROWN-Raymond F. Jr., 81 Of Valhalla, NY. Formerly of White Plains, Utica and NY, NY. Died at home on December 19, 2002 after a long and courageous battle with lung disease. He was the beloved husband of Doris Loebenberg Brown, loving father of Alison Lukacsko of Princeton Junction, NJ and Diane Treuman of Lawrenceville, GA and devoted grandfather of Daniel and Emily Treuman and Michael and Jeffrey Lukacsko. Raymond is survived by an adoring son-in-law Stanton Treuman of Lawrenceville, GA, a brother and sister-in-law Leslie and Barbara Brown of Naples, FL, sister in law Carol Freedman of Utica, NY and several loving nephews and a niece. Raymond was an integral part of an unusually close knit family. He was like a second father to nephews Peter and Jim Freedman and their wives Linda and Susan and will be terribly missed. A lifelong supporter of Reform Judaism, he served as a founding member and president of Temple Emanu-El in Utica, NY and was president of Congregation Emanu-El of Westchester in Rye, NY. He served on the Board of the NY Federation of Reform Synagogues and was a Mason and an active member of the Rotary Club of White Plains. He had a love for NYC including the theatre and exploring the little back streets and alleys. Traveling, photography, playing bridge and golf and finding a good steak were favorite pastimes. He served in the U.S. Navy during WWII and returned to graduate from NYU. He was devoted to two family businesses, Sobel Bros. and Jiffy Fire Hose Rack Co. in NYC until his retirement in 1994. The family requests that donations in his memory be sent to Hospice of Westchester or White Plains Hospital.
