        SCHWARTZ-Irving. We mourn the loss on January 3, 2001, of our founding and senior partner. Irving was a paradigm of the devoted ethical and compassionate attorney in the highest traditions of the bar. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his daughter, Toby; his son and daughter-in-law, Jeffrey and Karen; his sister, Ruth, and his grandchildren and great-grandchildren. May Irving's fine reputation and high regard in which he was held be a source of comfort and solace. Stein, Schwartz, Chesir & Rosh
