        MacRAE-Cameron F. The Board of Directors and the entire CLEARPOOL family mourn the loss of our dear friend and former leader. He provided extraordinary service to CLEARPOOL from 1951 until 1968, guiding the organization with remarkable distinction as President for much of his tenure. His generosity, wisdom and kindness profoundly affected the lives of thousands of children from New York City. Cameron MacRae established a legacy of pro bono legal service at the firm he founded, LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae, that has served CLEARPOOL for over forty years. We extend our condolences to his son Cameron F. MacRae, III and his family. Charles Dombeck, Chairman of the Board Peter Rose, President of the Board CLEARPOOL, Inc.
