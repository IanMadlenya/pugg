        KAWAMURA-Shigekuni. It is with deep sorrow that we note the passing of our dear friend, Shigekuni Kawamura. He was a faithful supporter of the Institute, on whose Board of Trustees he served for ten years. He will be remembered for his belief in the value of international exchange and for his commitment to creating a borderless world for knowledge-sharing. He will be greatly missed. Henry Kaufman, Chairman, Board of Trustees, Allan Goodman, President, Institute of International Education
