        DAVIS--Lewis. It is with deep sorrow that the National Multiple Sclerosis Society mourns the passing of our friend, Lewis Davis. Lew, a longstanding board member and volunteer, not only shared our mission, but helped define and expand it. He sought new ways to raise money, recruit invaluable supporters, and help MS patients in New York City get access to better care. Lew's contributions to the Society went beyond ideas and actions; his warm and humorous personality was always welcome in our office. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Anne and their entire family.
