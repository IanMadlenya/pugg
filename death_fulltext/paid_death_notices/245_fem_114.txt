        ARMSTRONG--Mary Margaret. May 1921-May 2007. Let Winter round me rave; And the next flowers that deck the Spring, bloom on my peaceful grave! (Robert Burns). Mary Margaret Armstong died Wednesday night, May 16th at the age of 85. It was an end to suffering, although peaceful at the last. At her request, she has been cremated and her ashes will be buried with those of her mother in Scotland with a Church of Scotland service. Margaret was a wonderful person and a good friend: I am sorry that she is gone, but watching her suffer was hard. She will be remembered fondly by all her who knew her. A Mass of Remembrance will be celebrated on Wednesday, June 20 at 9:30 am in the Holy Family Chapel at the Mary Manning Walsh Home and there will also be an annual Mass of Remembrance on Wednesday, November 14.
