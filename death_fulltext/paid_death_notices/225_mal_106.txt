The partners, associates and staff of Hill, Betts & Nash LLP mourn with great sadness the passing on October 5, 2005, in Maine, of our esteemed retired partner and extend condolences to his wife, Eleanor, and daughters, Anita and Elaine, and their families. Associated with our firm as partner, counsel, and advisor for more than 50 years, John specialized in corporate, ship finance and international law, mentoring generations of lawyers in these fields. He maintained homes in Manhattan; Peconic, NY; and Friendship, ME. A graduate of Georgetown and Harvard Law School (Class of 1940), he led a most adventurous life in his youth. Scion of a prominent family in Democratic politics and government, and at the New York Stock Exchange, John sailed as a merchant mariner on US passenger ships during his college summers; toured the Franco/German border by motorcycle on the eve of World War II, vexing the German army; and then served four years as an officer in the US Navy, engaged in antisubmarine warfare and escort duties. He commanded a corvette in the Atlantic and Caribbean. John was an expert in US, Liberian, Marshall Islands and Panamanian corporate and shipping law, and handled the sales, purchasing and financing of thousands of ships and hundreds of aircraft during his career. A speaker at various legal and finance conferences in the US and abroad, he and his wife were world travelers. He acted as a US correspondent and advisor for many of the leading foreign law firms and banks; and edited various maritime publications. He helped draft the shipping laws of several foreign countries, and received an honorary knighthood from the Republic of Liberia for his contributions to world shipping and African economic development. John's family has requested that any contributions in his memory be made to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, 120 Wall St., 19th Floor, New York, NY 10005; www.jdrf.org
