        KWARTLER--Ruth. On January 6, 2004 in peace at her home in Manhattan with her family. The sweetest, kindest and most adorable person imaginable. The perfect wife, the perfect mother. She was the embodiment of ''The Book of Ruth'' and we were lucky to have her unconditional love, support and devotion. Her extended family will always remember her famous Thanksgivings, Seders, and other celebrations. We, her children, spent our entire lives hearing people tell us ''I wish I had a mother like your mother''. Although she and her beloved Charles, who died in 1998 were married for 58 years, they were still mistaken for newlyweds. Now they are dancing together again. Survived by her children Alice, Jeanne, David and wife Yvonne; her brother Max and wife Estelle. Contributions to Visiting Nurse Service of New York.
