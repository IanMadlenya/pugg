        DAHL-Gunnar Andreas. The Auxiliary to Bellevue Hospital notes with sadness the loss on June 16th of our longtime friend and board member, dear Gunnar. His compassion and concern for our patients, reflected in his service through the patients' library, is a legacy that will remain. We will miss this wonderful gentleman and all that he contributed for so many years to the hospital and the auxiliary. Judith Makrianes, Secretary
