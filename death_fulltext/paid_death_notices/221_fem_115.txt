        FRIEDLAND--Beatrice. June 12, 2005. Bea, a quintessential New Yorker, was a graduate of Brooklyn College and the Manhattan School of Music. With her beloved husband Bernie, Bea spent many years as an activist, committed to social and economic justice. In the 1960s, she earned a PhD in Musicology from CUNY. A lover of all things French, she wrote her thesis on French music thus ensuring a brief residence in Paris. For many years, Bea was the Editor of Da Capo Press, where she combined her love of music and language. As a columnist for the Berkshire Independent, she wrote each year about the forthcoming Tanglewood season. After retirement she indulged her interest in French culture at the NYU Institute for French Studies, committed energy and resources to the Brooklyn Academy of Music and made it a point to enjoy the varied artistic riches of her city, New York. She leaves a sister, Helen, nieces, nephews and many cousins. The family welcomes visitors on Friday, June 17, at Bea's apartment, One Fifth Avenue, between 3 and 8 P.M. We will all miss her boundless warmth, her rapier wit, incisive humor, outspokenness and erudition.
