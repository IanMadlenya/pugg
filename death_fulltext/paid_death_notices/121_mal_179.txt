        ABDOO-Frederick The members of the Columbia College Alumni Association mourn the passing of its loyal alumnus, Frederick Abdoo, an active and generous supporter of the college and a devoted member of the class of 1941. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Helen, his children and family. Fred will be missed by all of us.
