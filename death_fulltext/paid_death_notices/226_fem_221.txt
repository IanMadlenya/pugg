        SYMONETTE--Lys. The staff and trustees of the Kurt Weill Foundation mourn the loss of beloved colleague Lys Symonette, who died on Sunday, November 27, at age 90. Musical assistant to Kurt Weill 1945-50, accompanist and advisor of Lotte Lenya 1962-1979, and Musical Executive of the Foundation following Lenya's death in 1981, Lys's contributions to the performance and understanding of Weill's legacy are irreplaceable. Her translations of librettos, editions of Weill's music and correspondence, mentorship of performers, and passionate advocacy for the composer's oeuvre live on as lasting monuments. A gentle, self-effacing, and generous colleague, she was much loved. We extend our deepest sympathies to her son Victor and his family. Kim H. Kowalke, President The Kurt Weill Foundation for Music
