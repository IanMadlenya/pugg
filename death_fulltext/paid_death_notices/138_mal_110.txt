        MAZER-William. The Brandeis University community mourns the death of a cherished and longstanding friend. A gentle and generous man, he provided wisdom and support as a member of our Board of Trustees for over four decades. In appreciation of Mr. Mazer's leadership, at Brandeis and in the community at large, the university awarded him the Distinguished Service to Higher Education Award in 1975, an honorary doctorate in 1977, and the Jacob A. Goldfarb Medal in 1982. Together with his late wife Helen, Mr. Mazer supported faculty research, undergraduate research and many other areas of Brandeis activity. The William and Helen Mazer Residence Hall stands as a testament to their devotion to the ideals of education. We extend our deepest sympathies to his children, Linda Berkowitz and her husband Leonard, Frank Mazer and his wife Angela, and Robert Mazer and his wife Magda; to his seven grandchildren, including three Brandeis alumni-Steven Bercu '85, Alan Berkowitz, M.M.H.S. '93, and David Berkowitz '91; and to his entire family. Jehuda Reinharz, President Barton J. Winokur, Chairman, Board of Trustees
