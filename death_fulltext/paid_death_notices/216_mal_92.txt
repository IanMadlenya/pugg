        DiPASQUALE--Dr. Nicholas. The United Cerebral Palsy of New York City community mourns with sadness the loss of our beloved colleague and friend, Nick DiPasquale. Nick made a tremendous contribution to UCP/NYC as Assistant Director of our Brooklyn Children's Program and, most recently, as Director of our Staten Island Children's Program. He touched the hearts of everyone he encountered and he will be sorely missed. We extend our deepest sympathy to the DiPasquale family. At the family's request, a fund for the Staten Island Children's Playground has been established in Nick's memory. To contribute or for further information, call 212-683-6700 ext. 207. Martin Hausman, President Edward R. Matthews, Executive Director UCP/NYC
