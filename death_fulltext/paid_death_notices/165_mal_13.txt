        SWINBURNE-John Knowles. The Long Island Plastic Surgical Group is deeply saddened by the passing of John Knowles Swinburne, M.D. This gifted and dedicated individual lost his valiant battle against cancer on September 26. His creativity and ability to see complex problems from a fresh and novel vantage point will be sorely missed. His gentleness and seemingly unbounded patience will always be remembered and cherished by his patients. His partners, colleagues, friends and family mourn the loss of his graciousness and gentility, and will always hold fond the memories of their own special times with him. He found beauty in life's simple pleasures and taught this truism to any who listened. He has slipped from earth's surly bonds and touched the lips of God. We will miss you, John.
