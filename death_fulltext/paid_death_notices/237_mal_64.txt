        SPRUCH--Larry. The NYU Department of Physics announces with sadness the passing of its esteemed colleague, a faculty member for more than 50 years. Here he established a career remarkable for its steady productivity at the highest level, with research contributions covering a wide range of subjects in theoretical physics, leading to international recognition and acclaim. He was an intellectual leader and teacher to the many students and research associates trained by him. Those who were privileged to know him will sorely miss him, for his scientific insights as well as for his cheerfulness, enthusiasm, marvelous sense of humor, and zest for life that made him a wonderful companion.
