        LERNER--Charles, a decorated World War II Army veteran and longtime Cooper City, FL. resident, died June 23. He was 91. ''He was very patriotic,'' said his wife of 68 years, Wilma Lerner. He was drafted into the service in 1943, leaving behind his wife and newborn daughter Judith. He served in the 29th Division of the 116th infantry, E. Company. ''I had no fright at all,'' Charles Lerner said in a 1998 interview with a local paper. ''We were a patriotic family. If I had to go, I had to go, and I was going to do the best job I could.'' Among the medals and badges Lerner earned for his service was the Purple Heart. While firing from the top of a tank, a shell exploded, leaving shrapnel embedded in his back. The blast took the life of a good friend positioned next to him. He was discharged just after Thanksgiving in 1945. Lerner was born in Brooklyn, NY., and attended Columbia University. He moved to Coral Gables and worked as a pressman. He returned to New York continuing his career at The New York Times from 1962-1978 and later retired to Cooper City about 20 years ago. Lerner was a member of the Veterans of foreign Wars and the Disabled American Veterans. In addition to his wife Wilma, Lerner is survived by a daughter Judith Lerner of Long Island and a grandson. A son, Tice Lerner, died in 1988. A memorial service will be held in Long Island in the future. Boyd's Family Funeral Homes, University Drive Chapel handled arrangements. Interment Calverton National Cemetery, Calverton, NY. >>AD#
