        RUBIN-Peter Jay. April 28, 1964May 18, 1999. Firstborn child and beloved son of Barbara and the late Walter. Devoted and dear brother of Randy. Loving grandson, nephew, cousin and friend. Peter had a deep love for Torah and Israel, closely followed by his love for the Knicks and English football. He traveled the world in search of knowledge and inner peace, which we pray he has found. Now he is together with his dad. His memory for a blessing. We will love him and miss him forever. Services will be held on Sunday, May 23 at 12:00 noon at Gutterman's, Woodbury.
