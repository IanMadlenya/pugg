        KAISER-Irwin H., M.D. Mentor, teacher and dear friend. A great man for whom prejudice was unknown and condemned. His memory will live long in generations of residents and medical students for his keen intellect, iconoclastic views which challenged them to better themselves. He was a pioneer in championing women's rights, causes and health care. An early advocate of patient's rights. To his wife Judge Barabara (of whom he was very proud) and his family our heartfelt sympathy and sadness. Kay and Mamdouh Anderson-Moukhtar, M.D.'s
