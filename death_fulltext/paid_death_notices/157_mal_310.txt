        DUNBAR-Alexander H., on February 18, 2000 in Washington, DC at 76 years of age following a long illness. The Partners of Saugatuck Capital Company mourn the passing of their esteemed partner and longtime friend. He was our partner for 13 years and a dedicated executive and tireless worker. Alex was a true professional in every sense of the word but had the ability and compassion to deal with all types of people. Born in Scotland, he served as a Major and demolition expert in the British Army during World War II in the Burma Campaign and on Lord Mountbatten's staff in India. He came to the U.S. in the mid 1950's and enjoyed a long and distinguished career as corporate executive. He was President of Uniroyal Tire Company; Group Executive of Amtel, Inc.; Executive Vice President and Director of the Singer Company; and Vice President of Amphenol-Borg. We shall miss him and extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Elizabeth, his daughter, Cindy, and his two granddaughters. Memorial contributions may be made to the Support Fund of Ingleside Presbyterian Retirement Community, 3050 Military Road NW, Washington, DC 20015.
