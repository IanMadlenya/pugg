        WEISS--Stephanie nee Thurnauer. Passed away on December 25 after a long struggle with Parkinson's disease. We will remember Stephanie most for her energy and enthusiasm, for life even in the face of many obstacles and her commitment to her family. She was generous with her time and attention, conscious of the details that would make something truly special for others. Stephanie was committed to nonprofit work, especially as an advocate for women's employment and nutritional education. Stephanie will be missed dearly by her many friends and loving family. We cherished the time we had with her. She was the widow of Walter and is survived by her children, Jim and wife Vered, Amy and husband Dan Reisen, Ellen and husband Scott Bull, her sister, Lilo Hoffman, and seven grandchildren.
