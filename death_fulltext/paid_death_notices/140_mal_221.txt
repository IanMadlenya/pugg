        KLEIN-Stanley. The directors, offices and employees of Encore Marketing International, Inc. mourn the death of our director, counselor and good friend, Stanley Klein, who perished on SwissAir Flight 111. Stanley's intelligence, love of life, good heart and generosity were and will continue to be a model for us all. Our deepest sympathy is extended to his wife Carol, his sons Abraham & Allen, his father Harry and his brother Stephen. No one can replace him in our hearts.
