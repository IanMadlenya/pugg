        SWEENEY--John A. H. Winterthur Museum & Country Estate marks with profound sorrow the death of its esteemed curator emeritus, John A. H. Sweeney, on May 17. His scholarship and leadership were tremendously significant to Winterthur and to the American decorative arts community. He joined the museum staff in 1954 after graduating in the first class of Fellows in the Winterthur/University of Delaware Program in Early American Culture, eventually serving as head curator and senior deputy director prior to his retirement in 1991. He worked closely on the restoration of the state rooms of the White House in the early 1960s, serving on the Fine Arts Advisory Committee for the Fine Arts Committee for the White House. He was also the author of numerous publications and was a member of the boards of many arts and historic preservation groups. He is survived by his two brothers, Dr. C. Leslie Sweeney of Raleigh, NC and his wife, Constance M., and Robert H. Sweeney of Navarre, FL. and his wife, Ann F., and by seven nieces and nephews. Funeral services will be held May 22 at St. Joseph on the Brandywine, Greenville, DE. The family requests that contributions in his honor be made to Winterthur Museum & Country Estate, The John Sweeney Fund, Winterthur, DE 19735.
