        WACHS-Moses. The Officers and Directors of Metropolitan Jewish Health System sadly mourn the untimely passing of Moses Wachs, beloved former executive director of Metropolitan Jewish Geriatric Center. For nearly three decades he demonstrated a true and real concern for the needs and dignity of elderly residents. A man of vision, he held a constant view towards the changing needs of the aging population and sought innovations in patient care. His leadership, integrity and a determination to achieve, were hallmarks of his success, and resulted in the excellent reputation of the facilities under his administration. We were privileged to work alongside of him, sharing common goals. He will be greatly missed. May his legacy act as a source of inspiration to all those whom he touched. Our profound sympathy and sincere condolences to the family. Steven L. Topal, Chairman of the Board Eli S. Feldman, President Chief Executive Officer
