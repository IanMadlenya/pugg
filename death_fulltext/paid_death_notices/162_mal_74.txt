        SNITOW-Charles. The Advisory Council of the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art, Cornell University, mourns the passing of Charles Snitow, who, as part of a rich and full life, was a devoted supporter of the arts at Cornell University, and especially the Johnson Museum. We will miss his humor, energy, and wide-ranging intellect.
