        HINES-Jerome. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the loss our dear friend Jerome Hines, whose career with the company spanned four decades, the longest of any principal artist. He sang 45 roles at the Met, encompassing the leading bass roles in the Italian, French, German and Russian repertory, and will perhaps be best remembered for his portrayals of King Philip and the Grand Inquisitor in ''Don Carlo,'' Mephistopheles in ''Faust,'' and the title role of ''Boris Godunov.'' A man of deep faith and a consummate professional, he illuminated each role with a keen intelligence, dignified bearing and above all, his noble voice. We extend our sincerest sympathies to his family. Joseph Volpe, General Manager James Levine, Artistic Director
        HINES-Jerome. We who sang roles opposite Jerry Hines relished his noble voice and interactive charismatic persona. Kenneth Lane, Wagnerian heldentenor Lake Hiawatha, NJ
