        ROVENTINI-John. ''Johnny Of Philip Morris''. Philip Morris Companies, Inc. notes with sorrow the death of John Roventini, who served for more than four decades as a Philip Morris spokesman and living trademark. Johnny's melodic ''Call for Phil-ip Morrees!''-first broadcast on the radio in 1933-was heard on thousands of Philip Morris-sponsored radio and television programs and at personal appearances across the country until he retired in 1974. By his own conservative estimate, Johnny shook hands with more than a million people and gave his perfect B-flat call more than a million times. The story of his career as a public personality parallels the development of modern entertainment, spanning the early days of radio and continuing through Philip Morris-sponsored television programs of the 1950s, such as ''I Love Lucy'' and ''Candid Camera''. Johnny's fame as an advertising legend was enhanced by an ever-present smile and outstretched hand that won him friends wherever he went. The Philip Morris Companies Inc. Board of Directors and staff pay warm tribute to the memory of our famous spokesman and roving ambassador, and we extend our deepest sympathies to his family.
