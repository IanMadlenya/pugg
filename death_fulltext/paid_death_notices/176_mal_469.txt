        SEKZER-Jason. The members and staff of Camp Sussex deeply mourn this tragic and senseless loss resulting from the brutal attack on the World Trade Center. Jason was a good friend who gave many years to our organization as a staff and board member and helped thousands of disadvantaged children. A fund will be established in his memory. Our thoughts and condolences go to his wife Natasha; his parents, Evelyn and Wilton; and his brother Mark. Memorial service Sunday, September 30, 4PM, East Midwood Jewish Center, 1625 Ocean Avenue, Brooklyn, NY. Victor Ozeri, President Gary Cardamone, Director
