        CHEVIGNARD--Jacques. The Grand Chambellan of the Confrerie des Chevaliers du Tastevin. Beloved friend, great patriot, builder and long time leader of the Confrerie, passed away on October 28, 2006 peacefully at his home in Nuits-Saint-Georges France. He was 89 and the first recipient of the Tastevin d' Or in 1991. A towering figure of heroic proportions possessing great charm, he enveloped a global entourage of admirers. It has been said that when confreres toast the President of France, Jacques Chevignard is the kind of Frenchman to whom we are conveying our respect and good wishes. We shall miss him greatly and acknowledge his lasting influence on our society and, indeed, all of Burgundy. Our heartfelt condolences and prayers are with his widow and our good friend, Eleanor, and his children, especially Grand Connetable Louis-Marc Chevignard and his wife Christine. Grand Senechal Carlos Arango, M.D. , Sous-Commanderie de NY
