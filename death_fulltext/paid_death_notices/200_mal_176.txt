        LIEBERMAN--George. We were fortunate to have had George Lieberman as our partner for 37 years. George possessed keen intelligence, consummate integrity and a tremendous dedication to our firm and our profession. He was a friend to all of us and we will always remember the sweetness of his spirit. We want to express our deepest sympathy to his cherished wife, Renee, his daughter, Jeanie Gallancy, and his grandson, Daniel Gallancy.
