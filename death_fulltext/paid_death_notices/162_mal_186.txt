        QUILICO-Louis. We note with great sadness the death of Louis Quilico, a colleague and performer with Opera Orchestra of New York. A good friend of Maestro Queler's since the day she played for his lessons with Martial Singher at the Mannes School, Mr. Quilico went on to sing the title role of Rossini's ''William Tell,'' Opera Orchestra's first performance at Carnegie Hall in 1972. After his big aria, an enthusiastic audience member shouted, ''Quilico sei un leone.'' Mr. Quilico sang in two other OONY productions together with Montserrat Caballe, Donizetti's ''Parisina d'Este'' and ''Gemma di Vergy,'' both of which were recorded by CBS. The world has lost a great Verdi baritone. Our heartfelt sympathy and condolences to his family and especially to his son, Gino, who also sang with the Company. Eve Queler and Opera Orchestra of New York
