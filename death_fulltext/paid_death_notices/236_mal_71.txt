        ANDERSON--George M. , An electrical engineer and physicist who pioneered the first gyroscope aircraft attitude control system for NASA's Skylab program while with Bell Laboratories, died of pulmonary failure at home on September 5 in Lincroft, New Jersey. He was 85. Born in Rochester, Pennsylvania, Mr. Anderson was the oldest of ten children. He graduated from Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) in 1942, following in the steps of his mother who had been among the first women graduates of the school. Having participated in R.O.T.C., he was commissioned as an Army second lieutenant with the Signal Corps. He led a squadron stringing communication lines behind the D-Day invasion force and attained the rank of captain before receiving his honorable discharge. Mr. Anderson married the late June Fisher and returned to Carnegie Tech to earn his D.Sc. and teach. After later serving as president of Thomas A. Edison Laboratories, he joined AT&T's Bell Laboratories and led the Skylab gyroscopic control program. By design, the system was critical to several Skylab experiments, which demanded precise spacecraft positioning. By accident, it immediately became critical to a mission rescue, as the craft?s solar shields failed on launch, and the new gyroscopic controls were crucial in the continuous spacecraft repositioning required to preclude fatal overheating. He retired in 1990. Surviving are a brother, John F. Anderson of Philadelphia, his three children, Kathy Donovan of Lincroft, N.J., Karen Plunket of Washington, D.C. and George Anderson of Middletown, N.J., and eleven grandchildren.
