        SORIA-Dorle. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of our dear friend Dorle Soria, a member of the association from 1981 & then an advisory director from 1983 until last year. Along with her late husband Dario, she helped develop the Met's Historic Broadcast Collection of live recordings. She later led The Met Archives Committee. Dorle's knowledge of the recording business and her dedication to the Met were invaluable. The Met's Soria Archive Library, given by Dorle in memory of her husband, remains a testament to their contribution to this company. Mrs. Gilbert W. Humphrey, Chairman Emeritus Bruce Crawford Honorary Chairman James W. Kinnear Chairman Paul M. Montrone President
