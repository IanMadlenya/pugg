        MILLER--Ruth. The entire Yeshiva University family is grieved by the passing, in Israel, of the Ayshet Chayil, the beloved wife of the late lamented Rabbi Dr. Israel Miller, and cherished mother of Rabbi David (and Miriam) Miller; RIETS' Benjamin and Charlotte Gottesfeld Professor of Talmud, Rabbi Michael (and Phyllis A.) Miller; CEO and Executive Vice President of the Jewish Community Relations Council, Deborah Miller Kram and Judith (and Jay Allan) Kalish, adored sister of Sylvia Bernstein, and devoted grandmother and greatgrandmother. A dedicated and compassionate rebbitzen and social worker, she was the virtual partner of her illustrious husband both in service to the Kingsbridge Heights Jewish Center over their many decades with the congregation and at Yeshiva University. A genuine caring and admired friend, she will be sorely missed by all who were privileged to know her. May the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel, President Norman Lamm, Chancellor Morry J. Weiss, Chairman YU Board of Trustees Julius Berman, Chairman, RIETS Board of Trustees
