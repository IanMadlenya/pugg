        YANOFF--Allen. Taken away at the peak of his life, Allen served as the doctor's doctor, legendary mentor and role model for hundreds of physicians, the man we all turned to for his wise counsel and balanced judgement that he shared with us so generously. Sincerest condolences to Laura, David and Julie. Dr. Michael & Joyce Frank
