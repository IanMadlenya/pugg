        WERNER-Mitchell. Our deepest sympathy to his loving family and many friends. He was a joyous man with an inexhaustable well of ideas and dreams. We are heartbroken at his loss, but celebrate his wonderful spirit and vision. He was a great human being whose memory we will always cherish. David Finn, Susan Slack and all at Ruder Finn
