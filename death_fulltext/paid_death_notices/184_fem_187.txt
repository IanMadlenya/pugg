        KAVEH-Tzipporah. On May 23, 2002, in Israel. The Officers, members of the Global Board of Trustees, faculty and staff of BarIlan University in Israel, and The American Friends of Bar-Ilan, mourn with great sorrow, the passing of Tzipporah Kaveh, beloved mother of the University's distinguished President, Professor Moshe Kaveh. A Holocaust survivor, she was the devoted wife of David, of blessed memory, and cherished mother of Moshe and Dr. Bracha Kramarski, Professor at Bar-Ilan's School of Education, grandmother and great grandmother. May the entire Kaveh family draw solace from inspiring memories and may they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
