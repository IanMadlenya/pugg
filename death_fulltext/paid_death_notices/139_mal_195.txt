        PENKOWER-Murry. The Board of Trustees, the Sisterhood, and all the members and friends of the Community Synagogue Max D.

We extend our heartfelt sympathies to his wife Lillian, to his sons Professor Monty Penkower and Professor Jordan Penkower, to his daughters Andrea Rosen and Sharon Kaplan, and to his eleven grandchildren who brought him so much joy and nachas. May the family be consoled among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Meyer Tendler, Chairman Board of Trustees Saundra Hershkowitz Chairwoman, Sisterhood Rabbi Naftali Rotenstreich
