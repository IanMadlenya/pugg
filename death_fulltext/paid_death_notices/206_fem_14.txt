        JENKINS--Phyllis Adams. Beloved wife of George Jenkins and cherished grandmother of Sarah and William Marsh, died February 26, in Santa Monica. Born in NYC and a longtime resident, she became one of the pioneering women television producers at NBC. In California, she was treasured for her pro-bono TV work on behalf on numerous philanthropic undertakings. An extraordinary gift for friendship leaves many on both coasts bereft. She will be sorely missed. A NYC memorial service for Phyllis will be announced in the near future. Janet Jacobs, Sarah Marsh William Marsh, Diana Gray Cynthia Hogan, Wylie Griffin
