        GARDNER-Douglas B. It is with great sadness we say goodbye to Doug. A former colleague, he was our best example of what is good in a person. His integrity, generosity of spirit and his kindness will be remembered forever. We will miss him very much. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Jennifer, and his children, Michael and Julia, as well as to his parents, Charlotte and Joe, and his sister, Danielle.
