        OBERRENDER-Girard F., M.D., The Board of Trustees and Medical Staff of Lenox Hill Hospital express their sorrow at the passing of Girard F. Oberrender, M.D., Honory Consulting Physician. Dr. Oberrender, who joined the Dept. of Otolaryngology in 1921, served with great distinction as its Director from 1945 to 1959. A highly respected and nationally renowned ear, nose and throat specialist, he was one of the country's first voice experts. Throughout his illustrious medical career, his deep commitment to his patients and to Lenox Hill Hospital was unwavering. Dr. Oberrender was a devoted and gifted educator who trained several generations of otolaryngologists, enthusiastically sharing with them his knowledge and love of medicine. The entire Lenox Hill Hospital family honors the memory of this truly exceptional physician who exemplified the highest standards of his profession. We extend our deepest sympathy to his family.
