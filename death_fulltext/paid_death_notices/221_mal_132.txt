        TWOMBLY--Edward B., Jr., The Board and staff of Berkshire Farm Center and Services for Youth mourn the passing of Edward B. Twombly, Jr., an important leader, volunteer and friend. For over 48 years, Mr. Twombly was a member of Berkshire's Board of Directors and a tireless advocate for abused, neglected and troubled children and youth. He was the third generation of the Twombly family to serve with distinction on Berkshire's Board of Directors. Mr. Twombly was an active member of the Board from 1954 to 2002. We will miss his kindness, generosity and spirit.
