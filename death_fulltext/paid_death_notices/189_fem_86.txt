        SARASON-Frances. A joyful artist, talented designer, world traveler and connoisseur of music and the visual arts. An innately curious individual who took great delight in her international arena of friends, family, artists, activists and intellectuals. Her youthful spirit and passion for social justice will continue to inspire nieces Patti Treger and Barbara Fresko and numerous beloved friends. We mourn her sudden death on October 6, 2002 and invite friends to visit on Sunday, October 20, from 2-6 PM to share memories, laughter and tears.
