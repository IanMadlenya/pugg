        LIFSCHUTZ-Rabbi Emanuel L. We record with profound sadness the passing of our beloved colleague, age 93. He served pulpits in the New York area, Pennsylvania and Ottawa before assuming the position of community chaplain for the Jewish Chaplaincy Service of the Milwaukee Jewish Welfare Fund in 1962 until 1977, when he became a chaplain at VA Hospital in Milwaukee. We express our deepest condolences to his children, Shelley Bruch, Dr. David H. and Jonathan S. Lifschutz and to all who were touched through his rabbinate. Rabbi Vernon H. Kurtz, Pres. Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Exec., V.P. The Rabbinical Assembly
