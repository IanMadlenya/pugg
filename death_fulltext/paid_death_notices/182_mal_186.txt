        UNTERMAN-Rabbi Jacob. 86, March 10, died as he lived-with great dignity and a strong faith, surrounded by those who loved him. Adored husband of Helen, dear brother to Chone and Harry, cherished father of Elana, Sonny and his wife Denise. Beloved grandfather to David, Deborah, Aaron, Rifka and Penina; as well as loved patriarch of the Becker and Bernstein family-Joe, Harriet, Larry, Sydney and Sarah. We hope to live by his example.
        UNTERMAN-Jacob. Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun mourns the passing of the father of Dr. Elana Unterman-Newman, and extends our condolences to the bereaved family. Rabbi Haskel Lookstein, Rabbi Joshua Lookstein Chaim Edelstein, President
