        COHEN-Abigail. The Jewish Theological Seminary community mourns the sudden and untimely death of Abigail Cohen, beloved daughter of devoted JTS board member Betsy Z. Cohen and her husband, Edward.

May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion. Ismar Schorsch, Chancellor Gershon Kekst, Chairman
