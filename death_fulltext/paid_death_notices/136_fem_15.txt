        KELLY-Tricia A. Her friends will be saddened to hear that Tricia passed away at her home in Williamsburg, Virginia last October 21, 1997. She moved there three years ago from her East 73 Street home. She sang in both the Saint Bartholomew and the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Choirs. Her memorable Kentucky Derby and Christmas parties lifted our spirits with her infectious good cheer. She may be gone, but she will always be with us.
