        GARVEY--Glenda J., M.D. The Department of Medicine notes with deep sorrow the untimely death on March 22, 2004 of Dr. Glenda J. Garvey, Professor of Clinical Medicine, whose association with and contributions to our Department extend back some 35 years. An alumna of Wellesley College, a graduate of the College of Physicians and Surgeons, and subsequently a member of the Medical House Staff and later the Attending Staff of The Presbyterian Hospital, Dr. Garvey devoted her entire professional life to providing unstinting service to generations of patients, medical students and house staff. She served as an incomparable role model for all those fortunate to be associated with her. Assiduous, faithful and tender in her care of patients, she taught by compelling example what it is to be a physician and friend. To the end, despite a long and trying illness, she set a standard for others in her passionate concern for patients and her commitment to bringing out the best in students and colleagues alike. In recognition of her contributions she was honored in 1998 by a Presidential Award for Outstanding Teaching from Columbia University. Dr. Garvey was a magnificent physician and teacher, and in her passing we have lost a generous, radiant, gallant, and deeply beloved colleague. We extend our deepest sympathy to her family. David A.
