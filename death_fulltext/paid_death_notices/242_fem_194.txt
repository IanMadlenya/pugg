        CAMPS--Helen Place of Rye, New York, passed away peacefully on March 25, 2007. Beloved wife and partner for 58 years of Lowell Crocker Camps. Her memory will be held forever in the hearts of daughter Linda Louise Camps of Greenwich, CT, son Jeffery Lowell Camps, his wife Judi of Larchmont, NY and her son Christopher Lowell Camps and his wife Loren of Katonah, NY. As ''Nana'' to her grandchildren Ashley, Jackson, Brooke and Hunter, they will always know they were the joy of her heart. A true renaissance woman, Helen was a club champion golfer and tennis player and as accomplished in the outdoors fishing as she was in creating her oil paintings and crafts. She made everyday special and the lives of her family and countless friends a little more complete. Her selfless love and sense of family will be our sense of purpose and memories of time with her cherished by all. A memorial service will be held on Thursday, March 29, 2007 at 10:30 am at the Rye Presbyterian Church, 882 Boston Post Road, Rye, New York 10580. In lieu of flowers contributions may be made to the Rye Presbyterian Church Memorial Fund in her memory.
