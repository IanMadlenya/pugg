        STYNES--Brendan J. With profound sadness, we mourn the passing of the steadfastly independent spirit that showed us all how to live and whose strong shoulders supported all of us through our times of need. He was the loving husband of the late Rosalie Barbieri, devoted friend of his late brothers William and Louis, and beloved father of Frank, Jim and the late Chris Stynes. He is also survived by his grandchildren, Chris, Jeremy, Michael, Patrick, Ian, Danielle and Katelyn, and by his great-grandchildren, Hailey, Tyler, Madison and Aubrey. Services will be at Fairchild Funeral Chapel, 1570 Northern Boulevard in Manhasset, LI on Friday, March 5, from 2:00pm to 5:00pm and from 7:00pm to 9:00pm.
