        GORLIN-Richard, M.D. The Department of Pathology of Mount Sinai School of Medicine deeply mourns the death of Richard Gorlin, M.D. He was a pioneer in cardiology, a leader and innovative scholar, a true friend of this department and a Mount Sinai ''giant''. We will miss him. We wish his wife Florence and the family our sincere condolences.
