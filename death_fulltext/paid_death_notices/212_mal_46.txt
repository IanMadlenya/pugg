        LAGUNA -- Lawrence. I mourn the passing of this immensely talented and interesting architect. He was so proud of his son Kenny Laguna, my best friend, songwriting partner and producer. He loved his granddaughter, Carianne. I was blessed to know him and his wife, the renowned artist Mariella Laguna. His modesty was humbling; his dignity innate. His kind and gentle spirit will be missed by all, especially me. Joan Jett
