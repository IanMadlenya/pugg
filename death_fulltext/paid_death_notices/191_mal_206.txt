        EICHNA-Ludwig W., M.D. The administration, faculty, staff and students of the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center express their deepest sympathies to the family and friends of Dr. Ludwig W. Eichna who served as the chairman of Downstate's Department of Medicine from 1960 to 1974. Dr. Eichna will long be remembered for exerting strong leadership in the field of internal medicine, and for his deep commitment to basic research in medicine, exemplified by his role as a founding member of the NIH committee that established the Medical Scientist Training Program in the United States. Dr. Eichna is also remembered for his many contributions to academic medicine, including serving as president of the Association of Professors of Medicine for the 1969-1970 term. Dr. Eichna won wide spread recognition when, after stepping down as chairman of medicine, he reenrolled in medical school. He chronicled his experiences in an acclaimed paper delivered at Harvard and printed in full in the New England Journal of Medicine. For his outstanding contributions to Downstate and to medicine, Dr. Eichna was awarded an honorary degree from the State University of New York in 1996. John C. LaRosa, M.D. President
