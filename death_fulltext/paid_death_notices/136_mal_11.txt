        HYMAN-Roger, M.D. The faculty and staff of NYU School of Medicine deeply mourn the loss of our esteemed colleague Roger A. Hyman, M.D., Professor of Radiology at the NYU School of Medicine and Chairman of Radiology at North Shore University Hospital. Dr. Hyman was a diligent teacher and a neuroradiologist who cared deeply about his patients as well as a leader in professional societies both locally and nationally. Our deepest sympathies go to his wife Susan, his sons Kevin and Douglas, and all the members of his loving family. Norman C. Chase, M.D., Chairman Department of Radiology Noel L. Cohen, M.D. Interim Provost, NYU Medical Center and Interim Dean, NYU School of Medicine
