        SASLOW-Claire F. With great courage, dignity and love, Claire F. Saslow, 84, died peacefully, surrounded by her family on March 8, 2002 after a short illness. Her children, Doris and Peter Tilles and Martha and David Maisel, and her grandchildren, Brenda, Diana, Lilly and Ben, recently shared a vacation with her in which Claire experienced one of her joys - her dream of seeing her children and grandchildren love and appreciate each other. As the young widow of Benjamin Maisel, Claire ensured that her children received fine educations and that they successfully launched their careers before marrying Seymour G. Saslow with whom she had many happy years. Claire and Seymour traveled extensively, and upon retirement as a legal secretary in 1981, she began her second career as a docent extraordinaire at both the New York Public Library and Gracie Mansion. Claire was an incredible role model and a tough act to follow. She showed us what life is all about and how to do it. She will be deeply missed by her children, grandchildren, sister, Selma Sulken, and her many friends. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to ''The Claire F. Saslow Docent Fund'' at the New York Public Library.
