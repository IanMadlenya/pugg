        GINOR-Zvia. The Jewish Theological Seminary family records with profound sorrow the passing of Zvia Ginor, eminent scholar of Israeli literature and accomplished Israeli poet, whose dynamic career and magnetic personality influenced so many. An extraordinary gift from Dr. Ginor and her children in 1997 in memory of beloved husband and father, Amos, made possible the creation of the Ginor Chair in Israeli society and culture at JTS, launching the academic study of contemporary Israel in America. A prominent member of the JTS faculty since 1982, Dr. Ginor is the author of A celebrated study of The Poetry of Abba Kovner, several volumes of Hebrew poetry, and a recently completed novel. She is survived by her three sons, Eyal Mordecai, Ron, and Netan, and their families. May her memory be for a blessing. Ismar Schorsch, chancellor Gershon Kekst, board chairman
