        SCHNEIDER -- Alan F. ''There's always some hope'' were the last words from a man not about himself, but as a reminder to those who too often forget. For a man who was considered by all who knew him to be the gentle one in his family of vocal and strong-minded women, he was the sage who appreciated standing farthest from the proverbial canvas, possessed the vastest knowledge of history and its trivial pursuit of future redundancy, translated the alphabet of everchanging technology into language for the predictable mind, and effortlessly exchanged all of these unrealized simplicities with people of all complexities. There is always some hope that Alan F. Schneider will pass this legacy onto his wife Ellen, his daughters Stacy and Shari and everybody else who has voluntarily buried these insights. June 16, 1943-July 12, 2004-Future.
        SCHNEIDER--Alan F. We met in our teens and through the years our families shared much happiness and many milestones together. We all grew older and were supposed to continue together into old age. Your leaving us was not in the plan. With dignity, strength, a great medical team and armed with the knowledge that you continually researched about lung cancer, you marched into battle to fight this disease. Your beloved Ellen was your true partner in this war. You both had the strength and the will for this battle and you both fought very hard. Alan, you were a beautiful soul--a man of valor and your courage was to be admired. You were a private, proud, honorable man and dignified to the end. You will live in our hearts forever and your beautiful daughters, Stacy and Shari, and your beloved Ellen are family to us and we will be there for them always. Susan, Lynn and Justin
