        CAPLAN - Marilyn. We mourn the loss of our dear, courageous, brave, loving friend, Marilyn, who set an example of all that is wonderful & good. We extend our deepest sympathy to Ron and his family. We have lost a gem. The heavens have gained a new star. Rest in peace, dearest Marilyn. Beverly and Ed Robbins and family
        CAPLAN-Marilyn. Her remarkable strength and spirit taught us all the meaning of dignity and courage-and throughout it all, she made us laugh. We will all miss her very much. Judy, Jordan, Jonathan Liz, and Sydney
