        FISHKIN-Harold. The friends and family of Hal Fishkin mourn his sudden death. Hal was an extraodinarily gifted community psychiatrist who dedicated himself to improving the lives of children and families living in poverty and crisis. Hal was a passionate, active, optimistic man who always strove to make advantage out of adversity. Every day, Hal was an inspiring example of living through making the most of each moment. We will keep the memory of his smile with us for the rest of our lives. Donations may be made to The Children's Defense Fund, 420 Lexington Avenue, Suite 655, N.Y., N.Y. We will meet to remember Hal together at 7:30 P.M. on May 17, 2000 at The Goldman's, Apt 12B, 1225 Park Avenue. Please call 212-348-5098 ASAP to say that you are coming.
