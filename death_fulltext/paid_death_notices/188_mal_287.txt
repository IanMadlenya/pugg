        ROGENSTEIN-Bernard. The members of the Board, the tenants and staff of 17 East 89 St. express their profound sadness at the sudden death of our cherished neighbor, Bernie Rogenstein. Our deepest sympathy to his wife Lucy, sons Gregg and Steven, and his entire family. We are all diminished by this loss.
