        ABRAMSON -- Shirley (nee Tansman). ''Sunny'' was the beloved mother of Leslie and Steven, loving grandmother of Lila and Geoffrey, motherin-law to Karen and devoted companion to Leon Lobel, died peacefully March 12, at the age of 84. Sunny will be remembered for her effervescent, sunny personality and its extraordinary effect on all those who knew her. Her kindness, generosity of spirit, passion for living and devotion for friends and family will be sorely missed, but cherished always by those who loved and cared for her. Contributions can be made in her memory to UJA--the organization that Sunny loved working for and was so good to her in return.
