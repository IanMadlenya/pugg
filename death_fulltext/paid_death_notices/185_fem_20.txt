        BEATMAN - Frances L. Board of Trustees and staff of the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services acknowledge with great sadness the death of Frances L. Beatman, a nationally respected professional social worker, family therapist and family theorist. Beginning as a young social worker in 1938, she became a key force in the development of services to alleviate family conflict. Throughout her career as executive director of Jewish Family Service (a JBFCS predecessor agency) from 1958-1977 and later as a JBFCS trustee, Frances was a creative and visionary leader. She was instrumental in expanding JFS' reach into the community through such innovations as a fee-for-service model, new family treatment approaches, a quick response unit and mental health consultation. Frances valued public support of demonstration projects aimed at preventing more serious problems. She was extremely devoted to her husband Joseph, a JFS board member for whom our Riverdale out patient mental health clinic is named. After the merger with Jewish Board of Guardians, Frances remained involved with JBFCS as an active Vice - President and member of many board committees. She believed the merger stimulated the creation of more services to troubled families and children. Frances understood the critical role JBFCS was obligated to play in helping those most in need. She was a bold thinker and receptive to new ideas but always challenged assumptions not based in sound clinical thinking. Frances will remain an inspiration to all of us. Our condolences to her nieces, nephews and friends. Jean L. Troubh, President Joseph S. Kaplan, Chairman of the Board Seymour R. Askin, Jr., Hon. Chairman of the Board Alan B. Siskind, Ph.D., Executive Vice Pres. & CEO
