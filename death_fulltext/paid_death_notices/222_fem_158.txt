        CENSOR -- Jacques. The Board of Directors, members and staff of JOFA, the Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance, extend their heartfelt condolences to our valued Board members Dr. Monique Katz and Gail Katz upon the loss of their beloved father and grandfather, Jacques Censor. Nicky, a most devoted daughter, spent the last year traveling back and forth to Israel to be with her father. May her kibud av be an example to the entire Jewish community and may the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Carol Newman, President Robin Bodner, Executive Director
