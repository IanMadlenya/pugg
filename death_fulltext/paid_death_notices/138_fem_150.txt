        HAUSMAN-Judith. Yeshiva University and its affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary mourn the passing of a long-time cherished friend and supporter. A painter and artist, whose works were exhibited in 1993 by the Yeshiva University Museum at the Cardozo School of Law Gallery, her joie de vivre expressed itself in the art of tzedakah and chessed. Together with her late beloved husband, Gershon, she was a YU Guardian and RIETS Fellow. They established the annual Hausman Stern Kinus Teshuva Lectures in New York and Jerusalem, consecrated to the memories of their parents, Elias J. and May Stern, and Moshe and Chava Hausman. Heartfelt condolences are extended to her children, Dr. Miriam Hausman, Dr. Evelyn (and Sylvain) Jakobovics and Reva Hausman, to her sister, Ruth Danis, and to the entire Hausman/Stern Family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University David S. Gottesman, Chairman Board of Trustees
