        FUDIM--Murray. My beloved Murray. Longtime companion, mentor, best friend died peacefully in my home on March 19th. I will miss your zest for life, twinkle in your eyes, love of music and good conversation, and all that you brought to my life. A special thanks to nurse's aides, Venice, Yvette, Cynthia, Rose, and Rolda my housekeeper, each one contributed to his care and allowed him to live with dignity during his illness. I could not have managed without their unwavering help. Goodbye my Murray, I will miss you, Marilyn.
