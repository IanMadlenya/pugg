        KELLEN--Stephen M. The American Academy in Rome mourns the loss of Stephen M. Kellen, philanthropist and international bridge builder. Together with Anna-Maria, he loved and supported many cultural institutions, including the American Academy in Rome, and brought into being our sister entity, the American Academy in Berlin. He was committed to enlightened exchange among artists and scholars, who will be his living legacy. Our hearts go out to Anna-Maria, Maria, Michael and all the family. Michael I. Sovern, Chairman David M. Childs, Chairman, Executive Committee Adele Chatfield-Taylor, President Lester K. Little, Director
