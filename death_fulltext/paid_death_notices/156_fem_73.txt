        APPFEL-Helene. The Yeshiva University family is saddened by the passing of a respected member of the Jewish community, beloved mother of our dear friend Charlotte Green, a YU Benefactor with her husband, the late Morris L. (Moshe) Green, who held leadership positions on the boards of YU and its affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary. Mr. and Mrs. Green furthered a variety of programs at the University. We extend heartfelt condolences to the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University David S.
