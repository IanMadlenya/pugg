        KINNEAR-Mary. It is with tremendous sadness and a great sense of loss that the entire Board and staff of The Metropolitan Opera mourn the death of Mary Kinnear, wife of our Chairman, James W. Kinnear. From the time of her husband's election as a managing director in 1989 and as Chairman of the Board in 1993, Mary Kinnear was his full partner in enthusiastically representing The Met to old friends and new, with energy, intelligence, grace, humor and sheer stamina. She was a wonderful ally to our company and to our staff. Through longstanding family ties to the Lyric Opera of Chicago, and her leadership role at The Met, Mary Kinnear truly understood the power of opera to enhance the civic and cultural life of this country. She will be greatly missed by everyone connected to The Metropolitan Opera. While sharing in their grief, we extend our heartfelt condolences to our dear friend, Jim Kinnear, and their children, Susan Kinnear Neul, Robin Kinnear Anderson, J. Wesley Kinnear IV, and William Mitchell Kinnear. Mrs. Gilbert W. Humphrey, Chairman Emeritus Bruce Crawford, Honorary Chairman Mrs. Ezra K. Zilkha, Vice Chairman Paul M. Montrone, President Joseph Volpe, General Manager And every member of our Board.
