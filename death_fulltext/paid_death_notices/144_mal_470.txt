        MOSSE-George L. The Officers, Directors and Staff of the Leo Baeck Institute are deeply saddened by the loss of our great and generous friend, George L. Mosse. We are proud to have awarded him the Leo Baeck Medal just this past November honoring his scholarship on a wide range of subjects dealing with European history, especially the German-Jewish dialogue. He taught us how to understand the irrationality of the Twentieth Century, how to distinguish between good nationalism and bad. His unswerving commitment to Judaism was characterized by an attitude toward life, a belief in the humanism and enlightenment that led the way to modernity. His analyses were consistently original, thoughtful and provocative, conveyed with humor and great style. We remember him with profound affection and admiration. Ismar Schorsch, President Carol Kahn Strauss, Exec.Director
