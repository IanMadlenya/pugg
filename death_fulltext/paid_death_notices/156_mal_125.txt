        GOLDER-Stanley C. It is with profound sadness that the officers, members and staff of the American Jewish Committee note the passing of Stanley Golder, an enormously generous and gracious man who sought to leave the world a better place than he found it. Stan was a member of the AJC family for many years, serving on our Board of Governors and Board of Trustees, as a National Vice President, President of our Chicago Chapter and most recently as an Honorary National Vice President. In 1994 we honored Stan and his wife Joan with AJC's Human Right Medallion. In every endeavor, he personified the very best of what AJC stands for-integrity, compassion, and a resolute commitment to human rights, intergroup harmony and Jewish values. Stan earned the affection and esteem of all who knew him and we will greatly missed his guidance and his friendship. We send our deepest condolences to Joan, his sons David and Kenneth, his daughter Nancy, their spouses and his many grandchidren. Bruce M. Ramer, President David A. Harris, Exec Director
