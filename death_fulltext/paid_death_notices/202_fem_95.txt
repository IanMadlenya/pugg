        QUINN--Linda. The partners, associates and staff of Shearman & Sterling LLP mourn the death at the height of her career of Linda Quinn. She was an eminent colleague, partner and friend. As an expert on securities law, she was a trusted and respected advisor to major corporations in the U.S., Europe and Asia, notably on issues of disclosure and corporate governance. Earlier, as the Director of the Division of Corporation Finance of the Securities and Exchange Commission from 1986 to 1996, her vision and leadership were key to achieving the historic reforms that opened broad participation in U.S. capital markets by foreign corporations. She has left an enduring mark not only on the law but also on all of us who had the great privilege of working with her. Her memory will be cherished for her dedication to the highest principles of the profession and her personal qualities of integrity, enthusiasm and warmth.
