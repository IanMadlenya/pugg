        FABER-Rabbi Salamon. We deeply mourn the loss of a dear friend, guide and neighbor. The depth of his Judaic and secular learning and his compassion and humanistic concern for others will be sorely missed. Our condolences to his wife, Gertrude Faber, and his family. Louis and Ester Moskowitz
