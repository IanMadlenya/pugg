        GOLDBERG -- Reggie. We mourn the passing of Reggie, a true woman of valor. Loving wife of Jerry, devoted mother of our dear friends Marlene and Steve Baum and her beloved son Larry who predeceased her. Reggie was a dynamo who was devoted to her grandchildren Remy and Dylan, her extended family and friends and the many charities to which she so passionately lent her time and energy. Reggie will be sorely missed by the many whose lives she touched. Marlene's Fire Island Family
