        PEARCE-Helen (nee Baslow). My beautiful, loving, precious, wonderful mother, who loved me and my husband so passionately & unconditionally, and who adored her precious David and Marilyn, passed away April 24, 2000. She was the most devoted caring wife, mother, and Nana Helen. She was self-sacrificing and full of joy especially when she made other people happy. She fearlessly brought about remarkable changes in our mining town in Virginia. She was fiercely devoted to her only child, Siema, Siema's husband Arnold, and especially her grandchildren. She set a sterling example of love of Judaism, Tzedaka, and sharing of one's self. She will always remain our idol. We will try to live our lives patterned by her countless examples and inspiration. We will always remember her beauty, grace, and endless, boundless love and devotion. Services will be held Friday, April 28, 2000 at 12 PM at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue.
