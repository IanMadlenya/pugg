        GRETSCH Charlotte Sommer Gretsch 1880-1928 It is with great respect and loving memories that we honor Charlotte Sommer Gretsch on the anniversary of her 125th birthday. Born on December 16, 1880 in Brooklyn, NY, she entered into eternal rest on May 12, 1928. Charlotte was the only daughter of seven children born to William and Theresa Sommer who later resided in Manhattan. She was the devoted wife of the late Fred Gretsch, president of the Fred Gretsch Mfg Co. in Brooklyn, the world's largest musical instrument factory. Charlotte was a very dedicated mother of 3 boys, Fred Jr., William & Richard. Her love was apparent in every aspect of her faith, family, and friends. She was an esteemed benefactor to many charities and organizations. Those who knew Charlotte Gretsch often referred to her as a ''saint.'' Happy 125th Birthday! The Family of Fred Gretsch Sr.
