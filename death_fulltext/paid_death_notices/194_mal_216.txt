        SHERWIN-Sidney. Lawyer, author, lecturer, athlete. After a valiant struggle died March 17, 2003. He will be forever missed by his devoted wife, Jean (his ''Zecie''), his most caring & respectful sons, Rabbi Byron (Judith) and Elliott (Sharon) and by his loving grandchildren Beth, Jason, David and Hope who enjoyed their ''Papa Sid's'' unique sense of humor. A reluctant farewell to a man who was always his own person, dynamic, imaginative, upbeat and original. All of us whom he loved and who loved him will remember his place in our lives.
