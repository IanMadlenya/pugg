        ADAMS-Frederick B. The Council of the Grolier Club of New York extends heartfelt sympathy to the widow and family of Frederick B. Adams. Mr. Adams took a keen and active interest in the Grolier Club throughout his 64-year membership, the longest in the Club's history. He held at one time or another nearly every position of responsibility within the organization, and served with distinction as its president from 1947 to 1951. The Grolier Club and the book world generally owes much to Mr. Adam's knowledge, leadership and support, and he will be sorely missed. William T. Buice, III, President Eric J. Holzenberg, Director & Librarian
