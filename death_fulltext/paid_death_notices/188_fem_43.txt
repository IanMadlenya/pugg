        SCHIFF-Gabriele D. (nee Derenberg) Beloved wife of the late Dr. David Schiff. Died peacefully at home on August 31, 2002. Devoted aunt of Lie Tugaye, Anne Dutter and Michael Derenberg. Cousin of Alice Auerbach and Anita Warburg. A lover of life and a friend to many. We will miss her laughter, her wide range of interests and her helpful guidance. A memorial will follow.
        SCHIFF-Gabriele D. Selfhelp Community Services, Inc, and United Health, mourn the passing of a devoted and loyal staff member of 38 years. As Director of Social Services, and later as Deputy Director of Selfhelp, her compassionate leadership inspired everyone with whom she worked. Her keen intellect and deep understanding of the need to provide services to victims of Nazi persecution contributed to Selfhelp's ground breaking programs. A venerated member of the Selfhelp family, her presence will be deeply missed.
