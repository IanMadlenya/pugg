        GLADSTONE-Anna Rosenzweig. Our beloved older sister Anna died June 17, 2002 in California. The first born of five daughters of our beloved late parents Jennie and Willie Rosenzweig. She leaves her 4 adoring Rosenzweig sisters, who mourn her passing; Blanche Golub, Ruthe Kahn, Miriam Nitzberg and Estelle Kellner, and sister-in-law Lillian Rosenzweig, the wife of our late brother Isaac. We have lost an irreplaceable treasure, the shining light of our family. She is survived by her devoted children and grandchildren in California and by many nieces and nephews on the East Coast, who adored their darling Aunt Anna. Rest in peace, our beautiful sister, we will love and cherish you forever. ''Many daughters have attained valor, but you have surpassed them all.'' The Sisters Rosenzweig
