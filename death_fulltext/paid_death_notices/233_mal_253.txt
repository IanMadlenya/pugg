        HANSEN--William P. Born August 9, 1940 died on June 9, 2006. He was an editor and writer for American Heritage, Random House and Chelsea House. After graduating from University of Wisconsin he studied at NYU and started his literary career. His works covered a wide range of topics from drugs to shells, world leaders and even comic books. His reference works on American politics and history are tomes for the ages. His wit, incredible sense of humor, playfulness, curiosity and powerful mind were a gift to all who knew and worked with him. He will be missed forever by his wife Janet and his daughter Nadja who found in him the most patient and loving of soulmates.
