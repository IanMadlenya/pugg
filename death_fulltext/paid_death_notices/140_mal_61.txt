        FUHRMANN-William. Age 40. Son of Helga, brother to Andrew, uncle to Oliver and friend to so many. Billy was a wanderlust who loved so much of what the world had to offer. He was also the quintessential New Yorker. The complexity and possibilities of the city mirrored his own life. He moved within its fabric, and embraced its energy with hope, wonderment and grace. We mourn the sudden, terrible loss of this loving, elegant human being in the tragic events of Swissair Flight 111, and offer our deepest love and thoughts to all who were touched by him. A memorial service to celebrate his life will be forthcoming. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to Hale House, City Harvest and the Starlight Foundation.
