        FRENCH--Joseph. The Board of Trustees of Long Beach Medical Center records with profound sorrow the passing of our esteemed colleague Joseph French. A man of boundless energy and commitment, Joe faithfully served the Medical Center for 32 years as a senior vice president of the Board. As chairman of our Planning and Patient Care Committees, Joe had a profound appreciation of the needs of the community and helped guide the Medical Center in responding to those needs. His wisdom, warmth and caring spirit will be sorely missed. We extend our deepest sympathies to his beloved wife, Doris. Alfred I. Osterland Chairman, Board of Trustees Bernard Kennedy President, Board of Trustees Douglas L. Melzer Chief Executive Officer
