        ULL-Robert. Bobby was certainly unique. He was our friend and client, limitless in his enthusiasm and energy, he reveled in his life and his family. His optimism for the future never wavered. We will miss him and will continue to celebrate that we knew him, that we worked with him, that he touched our lives, and know that he will live on in his wonderful family. We send our love and condolences to them all. Agins, Siegel & Reiner, LLP
