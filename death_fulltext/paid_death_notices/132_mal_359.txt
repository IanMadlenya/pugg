        HIRSCHLER-Andre. He was much esteemed in the cooperative community in which he lived and served for many years as President of the Board and most recently as a Director. We found Mr. Hirschler at all times a man of understanding, sympathy, learning and integrity who always sought to do his duty honorably and justly and was recognized as one whose acts and deeds were worthy of emulation. May the bereaved family find solace in the inspiring memories of the exemplary life of Andre Hirschler. Fellow Coop Board members and Shareholders Fifth 912 Corporation
