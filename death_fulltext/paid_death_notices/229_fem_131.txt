        BOEHM--Frances. The Five Towns Forum profoundly mourn the death of its founder, former Chairperson and present board member. Fran was committed throughout her life to the causes of peace and social justice. There was rarely a progressive cause in the United States that Fran and her beloved husband, Bob, were not in some way involved. She was a wonderful human being and knew the true meaning of friendship. We will miss her courage and clarity. Alvin and Rochelle Dorfman, Co-Chairs Five Towns Forum
