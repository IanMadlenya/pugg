        KESSLER--Gloria. We mourn the passing of our cherished Gloria Kessler. Beloved wife of Sidney. Loving mother of Alison, Jerry and Eric. Dear sister of Muriel and Paula. Devoted grandmother of Marc, Howard, Beth, Craig, Barry, Scott, Jason and Brandon. Adored aunt, mother-inlaw and friend to many. We will miss her laughter, courage and warmth. She will remain in our hearts always.
