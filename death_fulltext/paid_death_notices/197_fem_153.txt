        NICKELSON--Marilyn Stone. 72. June 20, 2003, in Las Vegas, NV, from complications caused by emphysema. What a lady! She died young. Chronologically she was 72, but her intellectual presence was always with the here and now. Marilyn was born into a conservative midwestern culture in Tiffin, OH. By her college years at Denison she had become a confirmed liberal and activist in Democratic politics that lasted the rest of her lifetime. She was a living example that a first rate public school education could match up with the best that private institutions could produce. Having a wonderful sense of humor she could laugh at a remonstrance of having ''leftist'' views and lived with the premise ''protect me from zealots of any stripe.'' An omnivorous reader and naturally fast, she loved the libraries in whatever community she lived in, often taking a half dozen books at a time for a week's reading. Marilyn could be scathingly effective in argument but she always looked for the best in people. Her greatest compliment to anyone was that ''he has no side.'' We miss her physical presence, but she will always be part of our lives. Her last words ''so what are you thinking?'' provoke staggering introspection. She is survived by her husband James, daughter Claire Wolfenden of Hillsborough, CA, son Stone of Las Vegas, NV, son J.T. of Newport Beach, CA, two granddaughters Abby and Page Wolfenden, sister Mary Radigan of Vermont, and sister Peggy Walker of Florida. Memorial gifts to the New York Society Library, 53 East 79th St, NYC 10021. >>AD#
