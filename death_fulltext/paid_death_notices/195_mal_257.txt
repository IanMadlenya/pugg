        STEARNS-John. The employees of Bear Stearns are deeply saddened by the loss of our colleague and friend, John Stearns. John, a managing director, was with the firm for nearly 20 years. As a Private Client Services broker, his insight, friendship, trustworthiness and warmth were valued by his clients. All of us at Bear Stearns send our heartfelt condolences to his wife Diane, his two children Elizabeth and Jack and his entire family. John will be truly missed.
