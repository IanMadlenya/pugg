        MERKIN-Hermann. Boys Town Jerusalem mourns the passing of a cherished memeber of its extended family. As Chai Founders, Mr. Merkin, together with Ursulla, his beloved partner in life and philanthrophy, provided scholarship assistance to Boys Towns' disadvantaged students, enabling them to receive a quality academic, technological and Jewish education. Mr. Merkin not only generously supported the study of Torah, but was himself an erudite Torah scholar. His committment to Am Yisroel, Eretz Yisroel and Toras Yisroel will serve as a lasting blessing and source of inspiration. Deepest sympathy to Mrs. Merkin and the entire family. May they comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Josh S. Weston, Chairman Michael J. Scharf, President Rabbi Moshe Linchner, Dean Rabbi Ronald L. Gray, Exec. V.P.
