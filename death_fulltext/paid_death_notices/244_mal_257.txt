        BECK--James H. Professor James H. Beck, 77, one of the world's foremost scholars of Italian Renaissance art, died Saturday, May 26 in New York. Professor Beck was known as a great teacher and as a mentor to generations of students at Columbia University, where he was a member of the Department of Art History and Archaeology and former department chairman. The faculty, students and staff of the department mourn the loss of our beloved colleague, teacher and friend, whose passion for art and for life inspired us all. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Darma, his son Mr. Lawrence Beck, his daughter Professor Eleonora Beck, his sister Ms. Antoinette Beck, and his grandchildren. A memorial service will take place at Columbia in the fall.
