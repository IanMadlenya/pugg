        APPLEBAUM -- Dr. David. We, at American Red Magen David for Israel, are deeply saddened at the tragic death of Dr. David Applebaum and his daughter, Nava, killed in a terrorist attack in Jerusalem.

He organized and directed the Emergency Medical Service at the Magen David Adom Jerusalem Station for more than 15 years. His memory will be a blessing for his family, friends and the countless people in Israel whose lives he touched. Dr. Robert L. Sadoff, ARMDI National Chairman Mark D.
