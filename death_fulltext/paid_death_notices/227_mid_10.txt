        $(6$)GOLDSTEIN--Gilda L. We know you've been away for a long, long time but now you're really gone, and we'll never see you again. If it hurt these last years to visit with you, it hurts more today to never be able to do so again. We love you, sis, and wherever you are, we hope that you are finally at peace. Irwin and Martha Feinstein
