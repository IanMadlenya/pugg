        LUBINSKY-Pessie Bayla. The Metropolitan New York Coordinating Council on Jewish Poverty mourns the loss of Pessie Bayla Lubinsky, mother of our esteemed Chairman of the Board of Directors, Menachem Lubinsky. Pessie Lubinsky was an inspiration to her family and to the Jewish community as a whole. Her ongoing acts of loving kindness and charity grew from her survival of the ashes of the Holocaust. May the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Merryl H. Tisch, President William E. Rapfogel, Exec Dir
