Grandmother of Jordana and Valerie. Widow of Wally Weber. Graduate of Wellesley/'31. Tam traveled the world in her later years with an insatiable curiosity and love of adventure that will be her legacy. She was smart, inquisitive, and loved to share her knowledge and experiences with those who were privileged enough to have known and loved her. Memorial servies will be held at Temple Emanu-El, 65 Street and Fifth Ave. at noon on Thursday, November 2. Contributions in her memory may be made to Temple Emanu-El or the Wellesley College Fund, Wellesley, MA. She was truly an original.
