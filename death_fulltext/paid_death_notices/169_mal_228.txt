        SCHWARTZ-Simon. On behalf of the officers and members of the United Federation of Teachers, we mourn the passing of a vibrant leader who was active in building the UFT in a 35-year career as a teacher and trade unionist. He served as the UFT Manhattan representative and fought for the rights of all working people through the consumer assembly, the municipal credit union and for children in special education. We salute Si for his leadership and offer our deep sympathies to his wife Frances, his children and grandchildren. Randi Weingarten, Pres., UFT
