        DUDAK-Herbert William, 71, on March 12, 2003 after a long and courageous battle. Beloved husband of Pearl, devoted father of Michael, Scott and the late Amy Jill. Proud and loving grandfather of Ashley, Jeremy and Ryan; caring brother and uncle. A loving, generous man whose friends were legion. His passion for life and sense of humor enriched us all. He lived for all the good he could do. His was a life well lived and we shall miss him forever.
