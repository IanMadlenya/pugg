        ENGELSTEIN - Phima. On July 11, 2002, of congestive heart failure, at the age of 82. She is survived by her husband of sixty years, Stanley, her brother Irving Greenfield, her children Laura, Daniel and Larry, her daughters-in-law Karen Levinson and Celia Radek, and four grandchildren, Max, Sophie, Henry and Lena. Dr. Engelstein was a psychologist in the Department of Psychiatry at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine until her retirement in 1980 and continued in private practice. We will miss her dearly.
