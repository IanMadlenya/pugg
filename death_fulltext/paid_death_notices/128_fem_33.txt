        ISRAEL-Sylvia K., age 89. Sylvia was a gifted first-grade teacher, a life-long fighter for social justice, a musician and composer of many songs for children's records; with her late husband, Leo, she co-produced the first records to accompany children's books. She gave time and caring insight to all who knew her. She is mourned by her daughters, Deborah and Laura, her son, Jared, her grandchildren, Jonah, Chris, Matt and Jennie, her nieces, Carol, Jan and Vicki, her nephews, David, Ken and Jerry, and cousin Evelyn and many friends. Our loss is great. Sylvia wanted no funeral; a memorial gathering will be held Sunday, September 7 from 2 to 4 at the Warburg Lounge, 92nd St. Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York. In lieu of flowers, contributions can be made to the 60 Plus Program at the 92nd St. Y.
