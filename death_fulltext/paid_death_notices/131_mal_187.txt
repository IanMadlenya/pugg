        BERMAN-David. We mourn the loss of a special and caring person who dedicated himself to the values and ideals of tzedekah and chesed. His deep commitment to strengthen the state of Israel and provide its people with compassionate and quality health care was evident through his endowment of the Berman Square at the Hospital with a Heart in Jerusalem. Generations to come will benefit from the largesse of this extraordinary friend and benefactor. May his memory remain for a blessing.
