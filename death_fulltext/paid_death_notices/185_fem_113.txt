        KALAJAN - Naomi (nee Malkin). February 28, 1916 to May 17, 2002. Beloved cousin, mentor, best friend. Naomi embodied beauty, kindness and wisdom. She was talented as a pianist and dedicated as a public health administrator. Her long years of illness were endured with grace and dignity. She never lost her inimitable sense of humor. Whoever knew Naomi wanted her friendship forever. How fortunate we were to have been her family.
