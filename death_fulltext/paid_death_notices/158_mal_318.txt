        WINTER-Rabbi Fritz. We record with sadness the passing of our beloved colleague. Ordained in Germany at the Hochschule, he emigrated to South America and in 1950 became the rabbi to the Central European Jews of Uruguay. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Hanna and his children, including our colleague, Rabbi Alfredo, and to all who were touched through his rabbinate. Rabbi Seymour L. Essrog, Pres. Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Exec. VP The Rabbinical Assembly
