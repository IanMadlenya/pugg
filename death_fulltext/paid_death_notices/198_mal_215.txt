        FULD--The Honorable Stanley. The Jewish Theological Seminary community mourns the death of Judge Stanley Fuld, a distinguished jurist and an unstinting supporter of JTS for more than 4 decades. His dedication to JTS was reflected in his long service on our Board, including his tenure as Honorary Chairman of the Board's executive committee and as President of the Louis Finkelstein Institute for Religious and Social Studies. He is survived by his wife, children and grandchildren. May his family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Ismar Schorsch, Chancellor Gershon Kekst Board Chairman
