        JACKSON-Alzie. The members, Board and staff of Camp Sussex are deeply saddened by the sudden passing of our friend and longtime chef, Alzie Jackson. Alzie was an inspiration and guide to the many young people that worked and trained in his kitchen. He was a dear friend to the children he cooked for and a breath of fresh air to those who had the good fortune to know him. We send our heartfelt condolences to his family. Funeral services Saturday, February 22 at Mt. Sinai Church, at Lanstown, PA, 11 AM. Call 718261-8700 for further information. Robert Silver, President Gary Cardamone, Director
