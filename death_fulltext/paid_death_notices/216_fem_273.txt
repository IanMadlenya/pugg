        CHEMLAR--Tiree Caroline. The Trustees and staff of the World Monuments Fund mark with great sadness the tragic death of Tiree Caroline Chemlar. A dynamic and much admired advocate of preservation; and a distinctly wonderful person much loved by all who knew her, Tiree Chemlar with her husband, Lubomir Chemlar, founded Prague - Vienna Greenways to promote cultural and environmental preservation along the route between Prague and Vienna, as well as the New York based Friends of Czech Greenways. She will be deeply missed and we extend our heartfelt condolences to her family.
