        KAPLAN--Sanford. A treasured friend and wise counselor, who served on the Boards of GAF and International Specialty Products for almost 20 years, Sandy was a modest, unassuming man with a remarkable graciousness of manner, endlessly responsive to those close to him. A trusted advisor and business confidante, he could always be relied upon for his unstinting loyalty and sound, practical advice. Our hearts go out to his two wonderful daughters, Maggie and Judy.
