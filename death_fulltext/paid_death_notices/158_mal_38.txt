        KEITH-John P. The Board of Trustees and staff of the Institute of Public Administration are deeply saddened by the death of our dear friend and Senior Associate. John earned his Doctor of Public Administration degree from the Institute in 1952, and became a Senior Associate in 1989 upon his retirement as President of Regional Plan Association. He contributed greatly to the Institute's work in the U.S. and overseas, including work in China, Japan and Portugal. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, daughter and son. In his memory, the Institute and family have established the John P. Keith Fellowship Fund to provide international research and travel opportunities for urban planning students at the Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at NYU. Memorial contributions to the Fund may be sent to the Institute of Public Administration, 411 Lafayette Street, NY, NY 10003. A memorial service will be held on March 15th at 4 PM at the First Presbyterian Church, 5th Ave. at 12th Street in New York City.
