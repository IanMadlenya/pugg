        KAUFMAN -- Jacob M. ''Jack''. 76. Beloved husband of 50 years, brother, father and grandpa, died at his home in Lakewood, NJ, on Saturday, May 14th, 2005, surrounded by his loving family after a long struggle with diabetes. Jack was born in Brooklyn and raised in Great Neck. He graduated with a BA in Business from the University of Miami in 1954 and then served two years as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army. Born into a family of jewelers, Jack himself went into the fashion accessories and costume jewelry business, eventually starting his own company with his beloved wife Fran, which they ran until retirement in 2001. Through his sincerity and his charm, Jack's business contacts became good friends. He loved fishing, travel, adventure, good food, and great music. Jack loved the ocean, piloted his own boat and was very active in the Manhasset Bay Power Squadron. He lived for many years in Roslyn Heights where he raised his own family. He is survived by wife Fran, brother Stanley, daughters Margot Goldberg and Jill Kaufman, sons-in-law Stuart Goldberg and Avraham Harris, grandchildren Peter, Samantha and Dustin Goldberg, and Lily and Nora Harris. Funeral services will be held at the Riverside Memorial Chapel in Manhattan, today, at 11:15 am, followed by a burial service at the Beth David Cemetery in Queens. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made in Jack's memory to the American Diabetes Association. We will miss you, Captain Jack.
