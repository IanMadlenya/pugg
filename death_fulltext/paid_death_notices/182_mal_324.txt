        MILLER - Rabbi Israel. The Trustees and staff of the Museum of Jewish Heritage-A Living Memorial to the Holocaust deeply mourn the passing of Rabbi Israel Miller. A revered leader of the Jewish people as President of the Claims Conference since 1982, he was dedicated to its mission to obtain restitution for Holocaust victimes, helping over 400,000 survivors in more than sixty countries to receive compensation payments. Rabbi Miller's vision included Claims Conference support of research and documentation of Jewish suffering, which will facilitate the education of future generations. We extend our deepest condolences to the entire Miller family. Robert M. Morgenthau, Chairman
