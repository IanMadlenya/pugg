        WHITE-Norman. The Board, Staff and Volunteers of the Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center mourn the passing of our dear friend Norman White. Norman had the foresight, determination, and commitment to be a guiding force during the Lesbian & Gay Community Services Center's formative years. Norman's generous spirit led him to serve on the Center's Board of Directors from 1985 through 1987. Even before his term on the Board and continuing until his passing, Norman was always a role model and a leader, volunteering extensively and giving generously. Norman was a true gentleman. His perseverance and courage as he faced his struggle with HIV and AIDS are an inspiration to all of us. Our deep sympathy goes to his devoted lover John Cunningham, and to his loving niece and her husband Sarah and Juergen Vogt. Everyone at the Center misses Norman more than words can say. We are forever indebted to him for being a beacon of kindness, courage and hope that lights our path to a brighter future for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Judith E. Turkel, Esq President Richard D. Burns, Esq Executive Director Lesbian & Gay Community Services Center
