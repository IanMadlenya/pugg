        WYMAN-William. The Ford Dealers Alliance would like to express our sincerest condolences to the family and friends of Bill (Earl) Wyman. Bill was a founding member of the Ford Dealers Alliance. He had a reputation as being a straight arrow and was well respected by the dealers and the Ford Motor Company alike. Thirty years ago the Alliance initiated an outside study on warranty reimbursement. Bill chaired that study, which received national attention. He had challenged the Ford Motor Company policy at a time when this was considered revolutionary and we as dealers knew that no one flew close to Air Force One. In that climate, Bill was one of my heroes. As a group, we were able to make a difference. I will remember him with admiration and respect. We at the Alliance will truly miss him. Ed Mullane, Ford Dealers Alliance
