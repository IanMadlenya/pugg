        DeSANTIS--Brian D. The members and staff of the Bergen County Cooperative Library System (BCCLS), based in Hackensack, NJ deeply mourn the sudden, tragic passing of our friend and colleague Brian DeSantis on Saturday, November 27, 2004 at the age of 37. He created the BCCLS computer services 17 years ago and nurtured them and his colleagues with an unmatched level of creativity, commitment and service. No words can properly express our love or loss. Consult www.bccls.org regarding ways we will remember this unique, special guy now and in the future. Robert W. White Executive Director, BCCLS
