        MEYER-Schuyler. Audrey Cohen College and its Board of Trustees sadly note the passing of Schuyler Meyer, a man with an extraordinary sense of justice, who devoted himself to making a difference in the world. In recognition of his outstanding achievements, the college awarded him both its Crystal Award and the Doctorate of Humane Letters. We pay tribute to his dedication to his passion and to a life well spent in fighting the critical social problems faced by our country.
