        COHN-Elaine M. Age 86, of Albany, NY, died Friday, January 18, 2002 at her home after a courageous battle with cancer. A warm, generous, exuberant and classy lady, she made life fun. We will miss her far more than any words can express. Born in NYC, she was the daughter of the late Dr. Leon S. and Tillie Moos. She was predeceased by her loving husband Myron J. Cohn. She was a longtime member of Congregation Beth Emeth, Brandeis and many other community organizations. She was a member of Colonie Country Club, Rancho Las Palmas Country Club, an avid and accomplished golfer and bridge player, and an enthusiastic world traveler. Mrs. Cohn is survived by two devoted sons, William S. Myers and John W. Myers and his wife Lucy, and their children Alexander, Jack and Caroline, whom she considered ''her jewels.'' She also leaves her loving sister Gloria Hatch and her favorite niece Patricia Roth, her husband Arthur and their children Jennifer Roth, Lisa Roth-Blackman, her husband Charles and son Alden. Services at the Beth Emeth Cemetery, Turner Lane, Loudonville, NY on Sunday January 20 at 11AM. There will be a memorial service at Congregation Beth Emeth in Albany in the spring. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Myron J. and Elaine M. Cohn Scholarship Fund at Union College or to the Albany Law School.
