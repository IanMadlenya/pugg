        RABKIN-Barbara. We have lost our sister, aunt and best friend after a long battle with cancer. She inspired us all with her strength and courage, not only in the last 5 years but throughout her lifetime. We will miss her smile, laughter and friendship that was such a big part of our family. Her memory will always live on with all of us. The Kotler Family
