        KLEMPERER - Werner. The Board and staff of the New York Chamber Symphony mourn the passing of its devoted board member and musical conscience. His attendance at rehearsals was often critical, for his extraordinary love of music was coupled with a critical ear. Our condolences go out to his great love, Kim Hamilton; his children, Erika and Mark; and his sister, Lotte. We will all miss him. Ernest Kafka, Chairman Gerard Schwarz, Music Director Omus Hirshbein, Executive V.P.
