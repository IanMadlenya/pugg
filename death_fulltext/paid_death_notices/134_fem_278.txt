        BRAUDE-Lillian. The President, Board of Trustees and staff of Guild Hall mourn the loss of Lillian Braude, devoted wife of distinguished poet/publisher Michael Braude. Lillian Braude was a distinguished longtime Trustee, patron and devoted Museum Committee and Hays Poetry Committee member who fostered this cultural center's commitment to literature and education. Her pathbreaking Poets and Artists Exhibition held at Guild Hall Museum was a landmark in the development of Guild Hall's interdisciplinary approach to the arts. Her warmth, vision, intellect and commitment are irreplaceable. We extend our deepest sympathy to her daughter Judy Kay and her grandchildren Adam and Rachel. Henry Korn, President Melville Straus, Chairman, Board of Trustees
