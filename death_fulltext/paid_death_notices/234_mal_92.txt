        TACKLER--Dr. Barry. God put Barry on earth to make people laugh and feel better, and called him back because heaven isn't funny anymore. He was the only dentist who could make me laugh while doing root canal on me, and the only dentist I looked forward to seeing. Our world is a sadder place without him. Helen and Hank Seiden
