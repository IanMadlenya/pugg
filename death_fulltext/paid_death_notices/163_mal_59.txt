        LIEBERT-Michael. Beloved and devoted son of Rose, passed away August 4, 2000. Michael was President of Carlebach Synagogue and an active participant in the Jewish community. He leaves behind his loving mother, wife Roberta, aunt Muriel Toffel, and a tremendous circle of friends. His mother's heartbreak is only softened by knowing how much love Michael generated in those who knew him. He will be missed by all.
        LIEBERT-Michael. We mourn the passing of a dear friend. Zecher tzadik livracha. May the memory of this righteous man be a blessing. Helen, Harriet, Jimmy and Wendy
