The Attorneys and Staff of Moses & Singer LLP wish to extend their deepest condolences to the family of their friend and colleague, Stanley Rothenberg who died on November 3, 2006.

He published numerous articles on copyright law and related subjects and was the author of several books, including ''Copyright and Public Performance of Music'' and ''Legal Protection of Literature, Art & Music.'' Stan received his A.B. from New York University, his LL.B from Harvard University and was a Fulbright Scholar.

Stan's intelligence, his good humor and his consideration for all who had the good fortune to work with him will be sorely missed.
