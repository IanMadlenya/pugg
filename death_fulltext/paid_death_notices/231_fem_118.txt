        BRODSKY -- Naomi (Rich man). Died peacefully on April 12, 2006, at home, in Mt. Vernon, NY. Loving wife of the late Irving Brodsky, devoted mother of two sons, David (Stacey), of Scarsdale, NY, and Richard (Peggy) of Miami, FL, adoring grandmother of the late Kate, and of Peter (Lael), Jane (Jesse), Benjamin, Isabel and Nell, and proud great-grandmother of Jacob, Katherine and Lucas. Born July 8, 1915, in Cincinnati, OH, Naomi attended Pembroke College where she met Irving. They were married in 1939 and lived in Providence and on Cape Cod until Irving's death in 2000. United by their love of family, Brown University, classical music and travel to foreign lands, they set a shining example of love, integrity, and decency for their children, grandchildren and greatgrandchildren. Naomi was a pioneer, teaching English at her beloved Lincoln School in Providence for twenty-two years, founding and running Operation Outreach, which provided scholarships to young African-Americans to attend independent schools in Providence, and then starting a continuing education program at Brown for retirees. Services will be at the Shalom Memorial Chapel, 1100 New London Ave, Cranston, on Sunday, April 16, 2006, at 2 PM. Interment at the Lincoln Park Cemetery, Warwick, at 3 PM. Contributions in her name to Brown University would be welcome. Shiva will be observed on Monday evening at the home of David in Scarsdale, NY.
