        KNABEL-Irene Shlivek. Age 96. The Harper family mourns the passing of their dear friend, Irene Knabel, beloved wife of the late Harry Knabel. In the 1920's, as a young social worker at the Irene Kaufmann Settlement in Pittsburgh, Irene mapped the diptheria epidemic areas of the city and made home visits to persuade mothers to immunize their children. She started a child guidance program in the Hill District. In 1927, from a small airplane, she dropped leaflets over Pittsburgh to encourage schools to test children's eyesight and hearing. Her memory will live on in those who were touched by her vision to improve the quality of life for all.
