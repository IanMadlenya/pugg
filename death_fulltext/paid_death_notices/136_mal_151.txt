        O'SULLIVAN-Benjamin. Left this world on May 2, 1998. During his life, he found interests in many social issues, but one moved him to become actively involved-his interest in the poverty, homelessness and grave injustices to the American Indian. Mr. O'Sullivan devoted many years to helping American Indians where he could. In the early 1960's, he accepted a position on the Board of Directors for the Association on American Indian Affairs. He was elected to the position of Treasurer, which he held for many years, and later was elected as Vice President of the Board. During his tenure, the Association was in the forefront in crafting national policy for American Indians. Ben O'Sullivan was part of the organization that saw its board discussions turn into Congressional action. AAIA was responsible for numerous actions that make life a little better for all Native America. He will be greatly missed. Brad Keeler, Board President
