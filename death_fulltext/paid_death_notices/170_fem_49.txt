        HARDING-Margaret Riker, on March 3, 2001. The Brearley School Community mourns the passing of an extraodinarily gifted teacher, beloved colleague and friend, whose keen understanding of the many ways in which children learn helped to shape the school's program today. Mrs. Harding, a member of the faculty at Brearley for 44 years, served as Head of the Lower School from 1963-1985; upon retiring from her administrative position, she returned to Lower School classroom teaching-her great love-most recently as a member of the Reading and Testing Department. Peggy Harding will be deeply missed, but the spirit of what she formed at Brearley will live on forever. We extend our sincere sympathies to all the members of her family.
