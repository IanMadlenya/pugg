        ROGOL-Florence, 88. Of Rockville Centre, NY, on November 14, 2002. Widowed in 1958, Florence picked herself up and forged a vibrant life on her own terms. A trusted office manager of a successful firm, she found time to read extensively, pursue her passion for operas and concerts, and to supply everyone she knew with her famous pastries. She steadily built new friendships by virtue of her loving ways, her courage and her quiet dignity. Humble until the very end, she did not want a funeral to mourn her loss or to celebrate her life. We honor this request but will not remain silent in her passing. Florence remains an inspiration to her large circle of friends and to her extended family.
