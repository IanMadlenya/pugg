        RIBNER--Paula. At the age of 96, died peacefully of natural causes in Long Branch, NJ on June 25, 2004. A resident of Palm Beach, Florida, she was a nationally acclaimed bridge player, the fifth woman to achieve Life Master ranking and a member of the only allfemale team ever to win the coveted Reisenger Cup, one of the major national open events. She was respected not only for her brilliant card play but also for her lovely demeanor at the table. Over the years, she was as smart as she was beautiful. Her brains complimented her glamour, she had wisdom with graciousness,-and a woman widely admired by friends and family-a truly beautiful woman in every sense of the word. After a brief career in show business, she was always up for a good party. She also served as a Nurse's Aid during all of World War II. She had three happy marriages: first to Edward Bacher, a World War II Admiral, then to Maurice Levin, a prominent real estate developer, and finally to Lloyd Ribner, an amateur golf champion. A loving and tender mother, she is survived by her two sons, Donald Bacher and Fred Bacher from her first marriage, along with seven grandchildren and eight great grandchildren. In the end, on her final days she retained her most prized possession, an extraordinary mind.
