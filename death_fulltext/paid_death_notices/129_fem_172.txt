        DISTLER-Betsy. IPTAR, the Institute for Psychoanalytic Training and Research, mourns the untimely death of our President. She was a strong, committed advocate for psychoanalysis and especially for the understanding of female identity conflicts. We will miss her warmth and her steadfast voice. Contributions to the IPTAR Betsy Distler Memorial Fund. Our condolences to her husband David and her sons Daniel and Joshua.
