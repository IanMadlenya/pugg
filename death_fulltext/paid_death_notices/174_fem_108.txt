        KAPLANSKY-Susan Grant. On June 28, Susan Grant-Kaplansky lost her heroic battle for life. The Lehmans, who knew Susan from birth, were devastated by her sickness, and now her passing. Susan was a wonderful daughter to Dr. Alfred and Ellen Grant, sister to Michelle and Laura, sister-in-law to Eyal Dagan, wife to Eyal, and loving mother to Edon, Tamir, Gil, & Eliya. She was a remarkable and idealistic woman who chose to live in Israel and raise a large family. We were all very proud of her and feel fortunate that we knew such a ''wonder.'' Our hearts are broken. May the family never know any more sorrow. Wally & Sheila Lehman & Family
