        DILWORTH--Elizabeth. The Rockefeller University community notes with deep sorrow the loss of our dear friend Bunny Dilworth, beloved spouse of the late J. Richardson Dilworth. Throughout Dick Dilworth's 37 years of dedicated service on our Board of Trustees, Bunny shared his interest in the progress of biomedical research, his passion for creating an environment where modern scientific inquiry would flourish, and his concern for our scientists. In particular, we recall her special regard for The Rockefeller University Hospital and its staff of physicians and nurses. We salute the achievements of Bunny's own pro bono life, including her role in creating the Princeton Country Day School and her involvement with civil rights and social concerns in New Jersey. She generously shared the fruits of her avid love of gardening with the many individuals and groups she welcomed as visitors to her renowned gardens in Princeton. We wish to conclude by recalling that the achievement of which she was most proud was raising four children. We extend our deepest condolences to her beloved children, Alexandra, Joseph, and Charles; to her grandchildren and other family members; and to all who loved her. Paul Nurse, President Jules Hirsch, Physician-inChief Emeritus Richard M. Furlaud, Chairman of the RU Council Carl B. Hess, Member of the RU Council Executive Committee Richard B. Fisher, Chairman of the Board David Rockefeller, Honorary Chairman The Rockefeller Unversity
