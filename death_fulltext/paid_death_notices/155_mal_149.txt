        BRENNER-Michael. The staff, Board of Directors, and volunteers of God's Love We Deliver are deeply saddened by the sudden passing of Michael Brenner, our dearly loved friend and evening Head Chef. Mike was always at his best when he was able to help others, whether it was greeting our evening volunteers, preparing meals for our clients, or just making someone smile. He enriched the lives of those who knew him, and through his dedication to our mission made a difference each day in the lives of thousands of New Yorkers. We extend our sincere condolences to his family, his loving partner Ruben, and his many friends. At the request of Mike's family, contributions in his memory may be made to God's Love We Deliver, 166 Ave of the Americas, New York, NY 10013.
