        JAMES-Dennis. United Cerebral Palsy, its staff, volunteers and 150 affiliates nationwide mourn the loss of Dennis James. For more than 40 years, Dennis generously contributed his time, talent, energy and love to UCP. He was the ''Father'' of UCP's telethon, hosting the event since its inception in the 1950's. His efforts have raised more than $700 million to advance the independence of people with cerebral palsy and other disabilities. We will greatly miss Dennis, his dedication and generous spirit and give our sincere condolences to his wife, Micki, his sons, Dennis, Jr., Randy, and Brad and the entire family. Leonard H. Goldenson, Chairman of the Board Jack Hausman, Vice Chairman Of the Board Michael H. Simonson, Esq., President UCPA John W. Kluge, President UCP Research & Educational Foundation Michael W. Morris, Exec. Director UCPA Murray Goldstein, D.O., M.P.H. Medical Director, UCP Research & Educational Foundation
