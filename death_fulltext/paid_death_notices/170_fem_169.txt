        MILGRIM-Laura Reina, Manhattan's lady of dignity and grace, joined peace on Friday, March 16, 2001. She was 68. She danced the Opera Ball in Vienna, toured with Bob Hope in the USO, explored the globe and loved the Yankees. Her laughter filled all rooms and she will again bless the world through her soon-to-arrive grandchild. She was a member of the New York Hospital Auxiliary, Nichibei Fujinkai club, and the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church. She is survived by her loving son, John Townsend Milgrim; former husband, Nathan Milgrim; brothers Richard and Thomas Reina; sisters Bonnie Kelley, Patricia Spradley and Marilyn Krone, and nine nieces and nephews. Raised in Kingston, New York, she has now returned home. Donations may be sent to The National CFIDS Foundation, 103 Aletha Rd, Needham, Massachusetts 02492.
