        HANRAHAN--James F., Sr. James F. Hanrahan, Sr., innovative educator and founder of St. Thomas More School in Oakdale, CT and devoted husband, father, grandfather and friend has died at the age of 82 surrounded by family. Jim leaves his beloved wife Patricia (Sweeney), 13 children, 33 grandchildren and one great grandchild. As a dad, he instilled the importance of a close knit family unit, religion and education and was happiest when with family. While teaching in the 1950's, he envisioned an all boys' school for the ''underachiever.'' In 1962 he fulfilled his dream by founding St. Thomas More School that has shaped the lives of thousands of young men. Born in Waterbury, CT in 1923, Jim attended Sacred Heart School and Crosby High. Important early influences were relatives Msgr. William Fox and Rev. Michael J. McGivney, founder of ''The Knights of Columbus.'' After studying in the seminary, he transferred to Georgetown University, graduating in 1947, earning his Masters from Fairfield University in 1952. As a teacher at Fairfield Prep, he coached men's basketball at Fairfield University, and was inducted into their sports Hall of Fame. Later, he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by Fairfield for founding STM. A memorial service will be held 10:00 a.m. Saturday June 24th in Our Lady Chapel at St. Thomas More School. In lieu of flowers, donations in his memory may be made to the James F. Hanrahan Memorial Fund at STM, 45 Cottage Road, Oakdale, CT.
