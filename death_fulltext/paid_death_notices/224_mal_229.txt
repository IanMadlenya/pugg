        MAMLOK--Dwight G. On September 20. My sweet beloved husband of 58 years left me too soon. He was the most sensitive human being, wrote the beautiful poetry for my song cycle ''The Andreas Garden'', short stories on a variety of subjects, and what a great sense of humor, despite the hard times of living during the Nazi era. He supported me in every way, helped in my musical and human development. He was so positive and courageously fought through his gruesome illness, cancer of the jaw.
