        FUCHSBERG-Shirley. The officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Shirley Fuchsberg, a cherished friend of UJA-Federation who was greatly admired for her extraordinary generosity. With her late husband, the Hon. Jacob D. Fuchsberg, Mrs. Fuchsberg shared her family's longstanding tradition of caring for those in need. She expressed an unwavering commitment to Jewish and other humanitarian causes. Her extraordinary legacy lives on through her children, Rosalind and Richard Kaufman; Janet and Peter Levine; Susan and Ralph Raphaelson; and Alan & Robin Fuchsberg. We extend our deepest sympathies to her entire family. Larry Zicklin, President Morris W. Offit, Chair of the Board John S. Ruskay, Exec. V.P. & C.E.O.
