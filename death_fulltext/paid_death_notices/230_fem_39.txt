        CLARKE--Evelyn A., age 84, died peacefully in the early morning of February 21. Born in East Orange, NJ on October 9, 1921, she was the oldest child of Evelyn Mansfield Clarke and Allen Hillyer Clarke. Raised in Summit, NJ, she attended the Kent Place school where she distinguished herself in the classroom and especially on the athletic fields. She majored in Zoology at Smith College (B.S. 1943) and later attended the Yale School of Nursing prior to marriage in 1946 to Charles Kennedy M.D. of Buffalo, NY. They were divorced in 1966. She subsequently earned a M.S. in Chemistry from the Univeristy of Pennsylvania and joined the faculty of Philadelphia Community College in 1970 where she taught until 2003. A licensed private pilot, she was also a cycling enthusiast, pedaling across Europe and the Rockies in her early 60's. She was an ardent advocate for equality in opportunities and status for women. A loving mother, she spent very little on herself, but denied her children nothing. She is survived by one sister, Jacqueline C. Walker of Montpelier, VT, her daughters Jacqueline C. Kennedy of Somerville, MA and Carol Kennedy Radmer of Valley Park, MO, and her son Allen C. Kennedy of New York City and his sons, her grandchildren, Ian and James. In lieu of flowers please make donations in Evelyn's name to Episcopal Community Services of Philadelphia, 225 S. 3rd St, Philadelphia, PA 19106
