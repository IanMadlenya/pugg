        ABRAMS--Roslyn. It is with deep sadness that the entire Beth Israel Medical Center family acknowledges the passing of our beloved friend and former colleague, Roslyn Abrams. Roz worked for many years at Beth Israel including serving in the Office of the President until her retirement. She will be remembered fondly by all who knew her and worked with her. To her family, friends and loved ones, we extend our deepest sympathies. Morton P. Hyman Chairman, Board of Trustees David J. Shulkin, MD President & CEO Robert G. Newman, MD President Emeritus
