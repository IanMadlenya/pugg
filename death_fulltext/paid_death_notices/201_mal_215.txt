        PURNELL -- Richard. We mourn the passing of Richard Purnell, husband of Marguerite Purnell, trustee of the Central Park Conservancy and co-founder of the Women's Committee. Mr. Purnell was a great friend of Central Park and a committed supporter of the Conservancy's work for over 20 years. He and Maggie were a driving force in the renaissance of the Central Park we know and love today. Mr. Purnell, a Princeton graduate and decorated officer in the Army Air Force, enjoyed a distinguished 35-year career at Johnson & Higgins that culminated in his retirement as Chairman in 1981. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Maggie and their family. The Board of Trustees Central Park Conservancy A.J.C. Smith, Chairman Regina S. Peruggi, President
