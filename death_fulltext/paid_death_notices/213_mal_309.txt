        BODNER--Irwin W., October 25, 2004. Beloved husband of Rita, devoted father of Bruce (Marlene), Mark (Francesca) and Lane (Val); loving brother to Leila; also survived by six grandchildren and ten great-grandchildren. A man of modest origins, Irwin retired in 1980 as V.P. of The International Division of Chase Manhattan Bank in N.Y. He joined Chase in 1946, after serving in the Air Force in WWII. Given the opportunity, he advanced from clerk to international financier; promoted peace by fostering trade and understanding between nations; and earned the respect of business leaders around the world. All who knew him attributed his success to a tireless work ethic, good judgement and strength of character. His success gave him an unfading sense of pride during his life and continues to inspire those who knew and loved him. Rita was by his side the entire way. The family requests contributions in his memory be made to the Campaign to Elect John Kerry President.
