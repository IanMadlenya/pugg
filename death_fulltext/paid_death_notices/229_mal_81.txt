        COLEMAN--Henry S. It is with great sadness that we note the passing of our Trustee Emeritus, Henry S. Coleman. Harry served as Chairman of the Foundation's Scholarship Committee for many years. He was a valued friend of ours and a great friend of the entire Columbia community. We extend our sympathy to his wife, Lila, and to his three children and nine grandchildren. The Trustees of the Columbia University Club Foundation
