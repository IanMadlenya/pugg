        HOFFMAN - Michael E. The Trustees and staff of Aperture Foundation mourn the passing of Michael Hoffman, Aperture's Publisher and Executive Director since 1965. A true visionary, Michael Hoffman made Aperture a leading force in the creation of a widespread audience for significant photography. During his tenure, he expanded Aperture from a small quarterly magazine to one of the world's most respected publishers of photography books and exhibitions. His commitment and selfless dedication to Aperture has been an inspiration to us all and he will be deeply missed. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to Michael's wife and our friend and colleague, Melissa Harris, and to his entire family. A memorial service will be held in 2002. John Gutfreund, Chair Janice B. Stanton Interim Executive Director
