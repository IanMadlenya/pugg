        JERNIGAN-Kenneth. We mourn the passsing of Kenneth Jernigan the longtime president of the National Federation of the Blind. Mr. Jernigan worked tirelessly to ensure equal access to employment and public accomodations for people who are blind. He dedicated his life's work to dispelling stereotypes and inspiring people with impaired vision to lead independent and productive lives. We have lost a true ally and friend. Barbara Silverstone, President Staff of Lighthouse International
