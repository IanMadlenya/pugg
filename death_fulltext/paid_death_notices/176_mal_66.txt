        ZEGARELLI-Edward V. Dean Allan J. Formicola, Columbia University School of Dental and Oral Surgery, records with profound sorrow the death of Dean Emeritus Edward V. Zegarelli on September 2. Dr. Zegarelli was a renowned oral pathologist who served Columbia with distinction for 41 years, the last 5 of which he served as dean. In 1958 he was appointed to an endowed chair with the title of the Dr. Edwin S. Robinson Professor of Dentistry. He was known as an inspiring teacher and a considerate leader. Dr. Zegarelli authored and co-authored more than 175 articles in professional journals and several dental textbooks. His many contributions to education and research will serve as his legacy to the profession of dentistry. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife Irene, his sons Edward V. Jr., David, Philip and Peter and his extended family. Allan J. Formicola, D.D.S., Dean Columbia University School of Dental and Oral Surgery
