        NUSSBAUM--Toby. With the passing of Toby Nussbaum the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty has sustained a major loss. Toby was a transformational presence on our board. Her insights on helping the needy, coupled with her humility, were a guiding force in our daily endeavor to make the world a better place for those among us enduring intolerable conditions. Toby cared about feeding the hungry, housing the indigent, tending to the mentally impaired, and reaching out to the thousands of abandoned elderly who need companionship and solace. To her beloved family, we thank you for sharing her with us. May Toby's memory be for a blessing and may her wisdom continue to guide our hearts and our hands. Joseph C. Shenker, President Merryl H. Tisch, Chair William E. Rapfogel, CEO
