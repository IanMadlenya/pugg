        FEIGELSON-Philip, Ph.D. The faculty and staff of Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons mourn the loss of our esteemed colleague, Dr. Philip Feigelson, who passed away April 9, 2001. Dr. Feigelson served Columbia University for more than four decades; first as professor of biochemistry and later as associate dean of graduate affairs at the College of Physicians and Surgeons. He was an outstanding educator and researcher who will be particularly missed by countless students and fellow scientists whose lives he enriched with his knowledge and expertise. We extend our heartfelt condolences to the Feigelson family. Gerald D. Fischbach, M.D., Vice-President for Health and Biomedical Sciences, Dean of the Faculty of Health Sciences, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons
