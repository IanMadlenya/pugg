        McKENNAN--Dave. Our beloved son-in-law and second son. His love for our daughter, Betsy was a joy to behold. They worked together, and played together; their marriage was a magic merger of body, mind and spirit. With his dazzling intellect, which he wore so modestly, his compassion, and sensitivity, he enriched our lives and made our too short time with him an unforgettable gift. Margot and Mason Adams
