        KONYA-Sandor. The Metropolitan Opera deeply mourns the death of Sandor Konya, who was heard at the Met from 1961 to 1974 in a broad repertory of leading roles in German and Italian works, including new productions of ''Lohengrin,'' ''Die Meistersinger von Nuernberg,'' and ''Der Freischuetz,'' as well as Cavaradossi in ''Tosca,'' Edgardo in ''Lucia di Lammermoor,'' and Pinkerton in ''Madama Butterfly.'' We extend our deepest sympathies to his family. Joseph Volpe, General Manager James Levine, Artistic Director
