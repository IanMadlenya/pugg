        AUBUSSON-Chrystian. The longtime French antiques dealer, Chrystian Count Aubusson de Cavarlay, passed away January 29, at the age of 82 in his Easthampton home. He was a much beloved and esteemed Manhattan antiques dealer who maintained his shop, Chrystian Aubusson Antiques, starting in New York shortly after his arrival from his native France after WWII, until his retirement in 2001. His wit and wisdom, elegance and good humor will be dearly missed by all those fortunate enough to know him. His many kindnesses will be well remembered.
