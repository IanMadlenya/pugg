        MOWSHOWITZ-Libby. We deeply mourn Libby's passing, a sister-inlaw rare beyond compare. She possessed a brilliant mind and a caring heart often expressed with a fine sense of humor. Her life was totally devoted to her husband, the eminent Rabbi Israel Mowshowitz, to her family and to the community. She served as a model and a guide to us all. We shall miss her greatly. Frieda Mowshowitz and Max Pusin
