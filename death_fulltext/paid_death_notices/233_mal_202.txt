Professor of accounting at LIU, QCC, and ORT College. $(6$)DWORETSKY -- Ephraim. Our community had been blessed and enhanced by Professor Dworetsky's visits. Professor Dworetsky was a man of intellect, humor, humility, humanity and showed the proper path of Jewish Orthodoxy in the modern world. In short, not only was he a professor of accounting but he was a teacher of life and Jewish piety. May G-d comfort his mourners, who include all of Israel, among the mourners of Zion.
