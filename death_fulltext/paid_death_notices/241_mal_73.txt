        COVINO--Charles. Manhattan College mourns the passing of Charles P. Covino, Class of 1950, devoted alumnus and generous benefactor of the College. His legacy lives on through his establishment of The Covino Room, a collection of life achievements as inventor and athlete, and a virtual learning laboratory for students and the College community. We extend our condolences to his wife, Sylvia, and daughter, Candida, and their entire family. Br. Thomas J. Scanlan, F.S.C. Members, Board of Trustees
