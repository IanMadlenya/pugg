        CUTLER--Mary Jane. We deeply mourn the passing of our colleague, advocate and mentor, Mary Jane Venger Cutler, EdD, RN, former Director of Nursing, The Mount Sinai Hospital and Director, The Mount Sinai Hospital School of Nursing, 1962-67. Dr. Cutler led the School and Hospital Nursing Department through a period of unprecedented change, fundamentally redesigning the education of nursing students and the delivery of patient care. Innovations during her tenure as Chief Nursing Officer included the development of a nursing research program, the launching of team nursing, the founding of the East Harlem Nursing Council, and a restructuring of the School's curriculum. Dr. Cutler advocated for the integration of practice and education through her publications and research, creating visionary models for nursing care delivery and nursing services administration. An alumna of Teachers College, Columbia University, she received in 2003 the Nursing Service Award of the Teachers College Nursing Education Alumni Association. Dr. Cutler's legacy of excellence will endure for generations, and positively influence the practice of nurses and their work environments. We extend our sincere sympathy to Drs. Jane and John Glick who survive her. A memorial service in Dr. Cutler's honor at The Mount Sinai Hospital will be announced at a later date. Thomas Smith, RN Senior VP, Nursing The Mount Sinai Hospital
