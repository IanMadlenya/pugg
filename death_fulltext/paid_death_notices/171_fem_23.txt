        SCHECHTMAN-Ruth. Died March 25, 2001 at age 81 at Calvary Hospital after a long and valiant combat with cancer. Beloved mother of Joan Bernstein, Helene Praeger, and Harris. Dear mother-in-law of Michelle. Devoted grandmother of David, Lesly, Jennifer, Denton (Herschel Meir), Matthew, Martha, and Isaac. Loving sister of the late Esther Chalif. She was a splendid woman. Gentle as she also was, she did ''not go gentle into that good night.'' She will be remembered for her kindness and goodness, wisdom & compassion, strength and dignity to the end. And, most of all, for the comfort of her presence and the sunshine of her smile all the days of her life. A graveside service was held on March 25th. at Mount Judah Cemetery in Ridgewood, N.Y. Donations in her memory may be made to the Southern Poverty Law Center, 400 Washington Ave., Montgomery, Alabama 36104. The children would like to express their gratitude to the entire staff of Calvary Hospital for its exceptional care of their mother during the last month of her life.
