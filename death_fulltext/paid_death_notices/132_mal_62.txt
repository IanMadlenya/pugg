        BERMAN-William C. Beloved and devoted husband who was care giver to his dear Alzheimer-afflicted wife Fanny, for 12 years until her passing in 1992. cherished, adored and loving father of Marilyn Grosfeld. Devoted, proud, and greatly admired ''professor of life'' grandfather (''Poppie'') of Scott. Adored, best friend and father-inlaw of Sonny Grosfeld. Those who knew him will always have fond memories of his intense loyalty, devotion and unconditional support of family and friends; his business acumen and take-charge leadership qualities which served him well as past president of both the amalgamated and Wynmoor Cooperatives; his inquisitive, inventive genius; his quick wit, sense of humor and ''impish'' charm; his common sense approach to and lust for life. We thank him for always being there for us-our Renaissance man. We will miss him forever. Service to be private on Tuesday, January 6, 1998.
