        RIVA-William. Born in Detroit, Michigan, July 18, 1919. He grew up mostly in Europe, later returning to attend Wayne University where his skills as scenic designer flourished. After Pearl Harbor he enlisted in the Army where his superior command of several languages quickly sent him overseas as a special translator. Refusing officer's candidate school, he remained a master sergeant throughout the Second World War, proud that his overseas stay-ofduty bars exceeded those of most generals. On returning to the States, he became Resident Stage Designer and teacher at Fordham University's prodigious Drama Department in New York, where he met his future wife, Maria Riva. On Broadway he designed the first production of Gian Carlo Menotti's ''The Medium'' in the round, having invented the concept of a scrim enveloped circular stage lit in such a way that, although appearing solid, was perfectly transparent for the audience to see the performance without being distracted by the audience across the stage. In the Fifties his award-winning, innovative commercial designs for television set visual standards still in use today. Riva became and remained a very successful designer and inventor of toys and board games, forming his own international agency to help other inventors. He died on the third of July in Bern, Switzerland, survived by his wife of fiftytwo years, their four sons-J. Michael, John Paul, and J. David of California and Peter of New York-and seven grandchildren.
