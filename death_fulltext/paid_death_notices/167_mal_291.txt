For the Editors of Psychoanalytic Dialogues and all of those who have become part of our community and extended family, the world is no longer the same place. Shock, inexpressible pain and unimaginable loss grip us all. Steve's intellectual brilliance and unparalleled personal generosity created the world of relational psychoanalysis. His creative vision altered and expanded the landscape of psychoanalysis, infused it with energy and vitality, and changed the way we think, not only in psychoanalysis but also in related disciplines. Our love and heartfelt sympathy to Margaret, Caitlin and Samantha. The Editors of Psychoanalytic Dialogues
