        McCHESNEY-MARTIN, JR.William. The Board of Directors and staff of the International Tennis Hall of Fame Mourn the loss of our friend & Honorary Chairman who was Chairman of the Federal Reserve and the youngest president ever elected to the New York Stock Exchange. A warm, generous & committed supporter of the Tennis Hall of Fame, his leadership in 1978 was responsible for starting the restoration of the Newport Casino, leading to its present position of recognition throughout the tennis world. Bill Martin will be deeply missed by all who knew him. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Cythia, and family.
