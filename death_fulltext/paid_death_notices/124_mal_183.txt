        BENDHEIM-Charles, of New York and Jerusalem. It is with deep sorrow and regret that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, AIPAC, mourns the passing of the father of our esteemed board member, Jack Bendheim. Philanthropist, pillar of the community, supporter of a myriad of Jewish organizations and causes, Charles Bendheim will be sorely missed. He leaves a legacy in the work that is being carried on by his children. We extend our sincerest sympathies to the family. May they be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
