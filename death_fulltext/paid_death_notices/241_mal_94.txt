        MURPHY--James Slater, M.D. ''Robin'' died Monday, February 5th, peacefully at his home in Deep River, CT, after a long struggle with cancer. He was 85. He leaves his wife of 43 years, Victoria; his beloved children, James B. Murphy II of East Haddam, CT; Wendy Bickford and Carol Lyden of Manhattan; Alice Murphy and Will Murphy of Boston, MA; and 11 grandchildren. He began his long association with Rockefeller University as assistant to Nobel Laureate John H. Northrop, later becoming Associate Professor in the Tamm/Horsfall virology lab. An avid sailor, ever-curious scientist, devoted physician, he exemplified the old-fashioned virtues of honor and civility. In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to the Natural Resources Defense Council. Family service on Saturday; a memorial service will be held on Mount Desert Island in July.
