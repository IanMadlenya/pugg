        SILVERMAN - Jeanette. Amazing yoga, tai chi and chi gong teacher, dancer, story teller and political activist, died peacefully on Friday, November 18, at 94 years of age. Her beloved husband Robert died in 1988. Jeanette was much loved by her daughters Ann Aviles and Rosalind Andrews, as well as by her sons-in-law, Anthony Aviles and Jim Andrews. Her deep interest in dance, as well as movement for health, influenced her two granddaughters, Elizabeth Evans and Erika Gamel, who adored their grandma as she did them. Her love extended to her grandson Michael Beinhorn, and her great-grandchildren, Nawal and Magdy Gamel, and Mia and Tae Shin Beinhorn. She was an inspiration to all who knew her. To celebrate her memory donations to Amnesty International would be appreciated.
