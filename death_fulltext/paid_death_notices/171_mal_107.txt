        ENGLISH-John. Members of the Board of Trustees and staff of the American Red Cross in Greater New York note with sadness the loss of John English, longtime Red Cross supporter. He was a devoted volunteer, serving over the course of the past decades on the American National Red Cross Investment Committee and on the Board of Trustees and the Planned Giving Committee of the American Red Cross in Greater New York. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Ann, and to his entire family. American Red Cross in Greater New York Jonathan O'Herron, Chairman Robert M. Bender, Jr., Chief Executive Officer
