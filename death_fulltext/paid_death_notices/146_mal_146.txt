        SACKMAN-Michael. We note with great sorrow the passing in Boca Raton, Florida of the leader of our family, Michael Sackman. He was the center of the universe for all of us. He was a tower of strength, a pillar of integrity and a source of love, support, compassion and wisdom for all of us. The world is a better place today than it would have been had he not lived. He leaves behind his wife for the past fourteen years, Bernice, his son Jay and daughter Charyl, a stepdaughter Helen and seven grandchildren. A funeral will be held in Florida today, March 5, and a Memorial Service will be held on March 10, at 10:00AM at the Lake Success Jewish Center, 354 Lakeville Road, Lake Success, NY. Contributions in his memory should be made to the Michael Sackman Memorial Scholarship Fund of District 1115, SEIU, 761 Merrick Ave., Westbury, New York 11590.
