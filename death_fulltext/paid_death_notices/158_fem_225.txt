        FRAENKEL-Cecele. It is with great sorrow that the Board of Directors & staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Cecele Fraenkel, a leader in the Jewish community and a longtime supporter of our Westchester Women's Campaign. Together with her husband, Francis, a devoted member of our Wall St. Division, she embodied the world of our services & the compassion of our mission. Our deepest sympathies go to her husband; her daughters, Sallie and Julie; and to her three grandchildren. May all who benefited from her kindness & wisdom be consoled among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair James S. Tisch, President Barry Effron, Chair, Westchester General Campaign John S. Ruskay, Exec. VP & CEO
