        MACHLIS-Joseph. The Juilliard School notes with sadness the death of Jospeh Machlis, distinguished member of the faculty since 1977. An innovative scholar, a remarkable teacher and a trusted colleague, Joseph Machlis had an enormously positive impact on the entire music profession. His engaging smile and his incisive wit will be missed by us all. Mary Rodgers Guettel, Chairman, Board of Trustees Joseph W. Polisi, President
