        KENNEY--Stephen G. Stevek made everyone in his life feel like they were his best friend. His limitless devotion to his Stratton Freestyle Team and Allegro Family was truly inspirational. He was our coach, confidante, guardian, enforcer, teacher, organizer, joke teller, a trainer of young minds, and giver of the world's greatest hugs-our loss is profound. To honor Stevek, we will keep his dreams alive, ski through our tears, and remember a unique soul who will live in our hearts forever. Debbie, Shelly, Alexis, Brent & Jared Palmer
