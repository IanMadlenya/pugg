        ALBOM--Edwin. The president, directors, clergy and membership of the Shelter Rock Jewish Center, Roslyn, NY, mourn the loss of Edwin Albom, a distinguished past president of our congregation, and we extend our most sincere condolences to his wife, Isabel, and to their children and children-in-law. May the memory of this righteous, charitable and modest man be a blessing for his family and for us all always. Harold Rabinowitz, President Martin S. Cohen, Rabbi
