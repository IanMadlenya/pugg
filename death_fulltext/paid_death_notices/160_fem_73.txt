        MAYDAN-Dalia. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) express profound sorrow at the loss of Dalia Maydan of Los Altos Hills, California, a visionary supporter of the American Technion Society, the Technion and Israel. President of the ATS Northern California Chapter, member of the National Board of Directors and of the 21st Century Leadership Group, Dalia's brilliant, passionate commitment was an inspiration to everyone who worked with her. A retired chemistry professor, she was instrumental in the development of the ATS Silicon Valley Chapter, galvanizing scores of high-technology professionals, executives and entrepreneurs-including many Technion alumni-to create a vibrant group. Together with her husband, Dan, president of Applied Materials, Inc., and one of the Technion's outstanding graduates, she was a moving force behind a recent innovative art program that celebrates the 75th anniversary of the Technion. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Dan & the entire Maydan family. American Society for TechnionIsrael Institute of Technology Lawrence S. Jackier, President Irving A. Shepard, Chairman Melvyn H. Bloom, Exec V. Pres. Sidney Konigsberg, Chairman, North Pacific Region Jack Kadesh, Director, North Pacific Region
