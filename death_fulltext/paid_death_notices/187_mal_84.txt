        STERNHELL-Sidney. On August 2nd, 2002, at the age of 80. Adored and devoted husband of Claire (nee Weissbrod) for 58 marvelous years. Much loved and loving father of Carol and Emily. Proud grandpa of Daniel and Benjamin. Cherished fatherin-law of Scott Passeser. Obstinate little brother of the late Charles and the late Arthur (always asked to read the wicked son at family seders). Lifelong fan of the Brooklyn Dodgers, Adlai Stevenson, Cuban cigars, and Claire. A veteran of World War II, Sid built a successful career as a life insurance agency manager but always valued his family most of all. We will miss him!
