        NEUBERGER-Marie. S. The employees and principals of Neuberger&Berman, LLC mourn the passing of Marie S. Neuberger. From her work with the Women's City Club and the Ethical Culture Society, to her commitment to Bryn Mawr, Purchase College and better education for all New York City children, Marie made the world a better place. Since Neuberger&Berman's founding in 1939 through the last years of her life she cared about Neuberger&Berman, our employees and our clients. She was our first partner and our friend. We are fortunate to have known her. To Marie's husband and our firm's founder Roy Neuberger, to their children, grandchildren and great grandchildren, and to the Salant family, we extend our sincere condolences.
