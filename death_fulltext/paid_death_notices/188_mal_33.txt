        HARRIS-Sheldon H. Professor Sheldon H. Harris passed away on August 31, 2002, after 74 years of an extraordinary life. He and his beloved wife, Sheila, were happily married for over 46 years. He was the devoted and adored father of Robin and David. A brilliant scholar, he was Emeritus Professor of History at California State University, Northridge, revered and held in the highest affection by his colleagues and students. Author of the definitive publication, ''Factories of Death: Japanese Biological Warfare, 1932-1945 and the American Cover-Up,'' which exposed the Japanese medical atrocities on the Sino-Soviet border during WWII, and was the culmination of his relentless investigations and exhaustive research over the past 25 years.
