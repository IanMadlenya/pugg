        PITTS-Bill. 1924-1997. All of his friends at Lois/EJL are deeply saddened by the death of Bill Pitts, our delightful co-worker, pal, confidant, Rabbi! Bill retired seven years ago to devote every day to his painting. His work displayed a growing artistic talent. But then, Bill was terrific at anything he put his brilliant and great mind to. He was one of the sweetest men to ever walk this earth.
