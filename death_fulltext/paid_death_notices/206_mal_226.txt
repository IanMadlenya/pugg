        CILO--Charles M. Jr. Novelist, Retired Ad Executive. Charles ''Chuck'' M. Cilo, Jr., writer, advertising executive, loving husband, and father, died Sunday, March 14. He was 65 and lived in South Salem, NY. Mr. Cilo was born in Passaic, NJ. His family moved to Connecticut where he attended Naugatuck High School excelling in literature, calculus, and sports, chiefly baseball. He later earned a BA from the University of Connecticut at Storrs. Mr. Cilo started his advertising career at McCann Erickson in New York City working in the mailroom in a graduate training program. His command of the English language, coupled with a brilliant creative mind, propelled his ascent through several agencies before landing him at the William Esty Agency (now Campbell Mithun Esty) from which he retired in 1992 as Executive VP, Creative Director. It was there that he helped create many of the most effective slogans and campaigns of the '70s and '80s for clients such as Datsun/ Nissan, Minolta, and MasterCard. Upon hearing of Mr. Cilo's death, Gordon Bushell, former Chairman/CEO, William Esty had this to say: ''A man with big, original ideas who could express them in unforgettable words, and presented all like nobody else could. A loved and respected leader.'' After retiring, Mr. Cilo continued his craft in the form of short stories and novels. He was working on his fourth novel at the time of his death. He will be missed for his humor, his conversation, his passion for baseball and music, and his overwhelming capacity for love and the support for others. He leaves behind his wife Eleanor, his son Charles M. Cilo III, his daughter-in-law Jill, and his sister Ruth Nord. A private memorial ceremony will be held in his honor. Contributions may be made to Ridgefield Fire Deptartment Ambulance Fund, 6 Catoonah Street, Ridgefield, CT 06977.
