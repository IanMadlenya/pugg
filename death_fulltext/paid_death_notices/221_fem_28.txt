        LAREDO--Ruth. The House of Steinway & Sons notes with deep sorrow the untimely passing of the distinguished American pianist Ruth Laredo on May 25 in New York City at the age of 67. A highly valued member of our Steinway Artist family for twenty years, Ms. Laredo was an accomplished soloist and chamber musician, and an indefatigable spirit in the New York music world. A native of Detroit, Ms Laredo studied with Rudolf Serkin at the Curtis Institute of Music. She was drawn to the music of Maurice Ravel, Sergei Rachmaninoff and Alexander Scriabin, and her performances and Grammy-nominated recordings of those composers' works, among others, won her a large and devoted following. Her acclaimed series at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, ''Concerts with Commentary'', was in its seventeenth season at the time of her death. Ms. Laredo was warmly received as a participating artist in Steinway & Sons' 135th anniversary concert at Carnegie Hall on June 2, 1988. We wish to convey our heartfelt condolences to her daughter Jennifer and to her family. She will be sorely missed. Bruce A. Stevens, President Peter B. Goodrich, V.P., Worldwide Concert and Artist Activities
