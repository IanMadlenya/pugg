        URIS--Leon. B'nai B'rith International mourns the passing of Leon Uris, winner of its 1988 Gold Medal, and a long time member of its Lecture Bureau. Uris was devoted to the cause of freedom. A U.S. Marine, he fought at Guadalcanal; a proud Jewish American he championed Israel's fight for independence and security; a devoted friend of Ireland's freedom fighters. Battle Cry, Exodus, Mila 18 and Trinity inspired tens of millions. May His Memory Serve as a Blessing to all who fight for freedom. Joel S. Kaplan President Daniel S. Mariaschin Executive Vice President Dr. Michael Neiditch Chair, B'nai B'rith Klutznick Museum >>AD#
