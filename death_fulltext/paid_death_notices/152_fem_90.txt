She was the loving sister of Alma (Boots) Chase of Dallas, Texas and Eugenia Tucker, deceased, of Beaumont, Texas. Martha divided her time between her residences in Beaumont, Texas and Locust Valley, New York. All who knew her will remember Martha for her sparkling wit, her intelligence and great strength of character. Martha was a pillar of strength in the raising of her five boys, and she demonstrated that spirit to the end. She spent countless hours devoted to the nurturing of her grandchildren, whether in travel to far off places or on the tennis court, or over a card table, and she will be remebered most as a wonderful and constant mother and grandmother. Martha was a graduate of the University of Texas at Austin, where she graduated as a member of Phi Beta Kappa, Pi Beta Phi. She was a member of the American Contract Bridge League, The Garden Club of America, The Piping Rock Club, Locust Valley, New York and the Beaumont Country Club, Beaumont, TX.

The funeral is scheduled for Monday, September 13, 1999 at 10:30 AM at The Christ Church United Methodist Church, at Park Avenue and 60th Street. Her family asks that any contributions in her memory be made to the National Audubon Society, 700 Broadway, New York, NY 10003 to honor her favorite past time of ornithology.
