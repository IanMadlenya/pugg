        FAULDING-Charles. The 100,000member Transport Workers Union of America mourns the passing of our retired Secretary Treasurer on March 9, 1997 after a brief illness at Parkway Hospital, Forest Hills, Queens. He was 81. He had retired in February 1991 after a distinguished 48-year career as a member and officer of TWU's flagship Local 100 in New York City and the national TWU of America. In 1980, as Secretary Treasurer of the 35,000-member Local 100, Mr. Faulding played a key role in the 11-day New York City transit strike. Despite his retirement from TWU, Mr. Faulding remained 1st Vice President of the New York City Central Labor Council's Black Trade Union Leadership Committee; an officer of the Municipal Credit Union; a member of One Hundred Black Men, a life member of the NAACP, and was founder of the Senior Citizens Garden Club in Roy Wilkins Park, Queens. During his nearly five decades as a union officer for TWU, Mr. Faulding held almost every elected position in Local 100, except President, including 26 years of service as Shop Steward, Vice Chairman and Chairman of the Local's United Motormen's Division. Born in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, in 1916, he came to New York at the age of 11. He became involved in the union movement for transit workers when he became a Trolley Motorman. He joined Local 100, and soon after was selected Shop Steward and immediately became a solidifying force. Mr. Faulding joined the national union's staff in 1985 as Secretary Treasurer, a position he held until his retirement. He is a charter member and former President of the BMT Surface Operators Club which was founded in 1943 when minorities were first hired into New York Surface transportation. Our deepest condolences to his son George, five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. Friends may pay their respects at J. Foster Phillips Funeral Home, 179-24 Linden Blvd, Jamaica, NY Friday, March 14, 1997. Funeral Services Saturday 9 AM, Trinity Lutheran Church of Locust Manor, 121-02 Merril St, Jamaica, NY.
