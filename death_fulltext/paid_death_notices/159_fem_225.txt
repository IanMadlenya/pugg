        CALLAHAN-Lavina Murray. It is with great sadness that we record the death on April 24, 2000 of Lavina Callahan. Beloved mother of Lynn, Gill, Rory, Kevin, Brian, and Michael Callahan; grandmother of Kim Callahan Navarre and of Josh, Maris, Derek, Meagan, Eliza, and Kristin Callahan; and great grandmother of Ryan Navarre. She will always be cherished by her family and friends for her wisdom, selflessness and generosity, wonderful wit and humor, and for the hardworking example she unfailingly set. A memorial service will be held at a later date.
