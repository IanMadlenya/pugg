        CADMUS-Paul. All of us at SAGE are deeply saddened by the passing of Paul Cadmus. He enriched our community with his wit, his exceptional powers of observation and his artistic skill. In November 1999, SAGE honored him with a Lifetime Achievement Award for his honesty and his insight, and for being true to his vision, even when that vision proved to be ahead of its time. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his partner and muse of 35 years, Jon Andersson, and join him in mourning the loss of a great artist, a lover of beauty and a true pioneer.
