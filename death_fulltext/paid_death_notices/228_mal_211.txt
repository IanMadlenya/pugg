        MARTIN--Edward James. On Tuesday, January 17, from injuries suffered from a car accident in Durham, NC. He was 68. The son of Michael and Theresa Martin, he was born on January 11, 1938 and was raised in the Bronx. While he briefly lived in Georgia, California and Nevada, his love for his family and his friends brought him back to the New York City area where he spent much of his life. Growing up in New York City, Eddie had the opportunity to relish the Yankees' glory years of the '50s, the emergence of the New York Football Giants, and the Knicks' championship years. He loved New York. He loved life and will be missed by all who had the privilege to know his wit, generosity and humor. His restless curiosity and keen intellect led Eddie to pursue interesting and sometimes odd fields of study, ranging from devising systems to beat the ponies and various games of chance to forays into the occult. He was never dull. Edward is survived by his sisters Margaret List and Theresa Tietjen and his brothers John, Michael and Patrick. Eddie graduated from Iona College in 1962 and retired from NASDAQ in 2003 where he worked in the IT department. Ed will be interred on Saturday, January 21 in St. Raymond's Cemetery, Bronx. There will be a brief memorial service held at the graveside. For information call Wyman Fisher Funeral Home at 845-735-2161
