        ASCH-Stuart S., M.D. The Association for Psychoanalytic Medicine, the faculty, staff and candidates of the Columbia University Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research mourn the passing of our esteemed colleague, Stuart Asch. Dr. Asch, a supervising and training analyst at the Center, was an active and valuable member of the psychoanalytic community. We remember him as a man of great sensitivity and humor and an inspiring teacher to several generations of psychiatrists and psychoanalysts. We extend our sympathy to his wife Mary Trudel, his children, stepchildren, and grandchildren. Robert A. Glick, M.D. Director, Psychoanalytic Center Vivian Pender, M.D. President, APM
