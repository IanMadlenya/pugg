        DELANO--William A. The Trustees of the St. Mark's Historic Landmark Fund and the advisory board of the Neighborhood Preservation Center express their sadness at the passing of William Delano, husband of its esteemed Chair Emeritus, Georgia Delano. Whether in Chinese seamen's cap, kilt, or bowler, Billy was a true champion of neighborhood regeneration and international peace; and, always a steadfast friend of St. Mark's Church in-theBowery. We offer our deepest sympathy to his family.
