        STARFIELD-Eva L. (nee Illions). On January 2, 2003, in her 95th year. Wife of the late Martin J. Starfield, cherished mother of daughters Barbara and Phoebe, and loving grandmother of Robert, Jon, Steven and Deborah Holtzman. She is also survived by her five sisters and brothers, son-in-law Neil A. Holtzman, son-in-law Neal Nathanson and his children Katherine, John and Daniel, and seven great-grandchildren. After a career of teaching, she devoted the following 32 years not only to her family but also to her Brooklyn Heights community and to the welfare of the residents at 140 Cadman Plaza West Co-op. A gentle woman of indomitable strength and deep-seated idealism, she will be sorely missed by both family and friends.
