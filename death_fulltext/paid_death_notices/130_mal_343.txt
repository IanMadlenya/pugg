        THALER-Rabbi Richard. ''The Crown of our Head is Fallen'' (Lamentations 5:16). Our hearts are bleeding at the loss of a dynamic 41 year old young man and our Rabbi, who possessed a boundless love for the Jewish people, the State of Israel and an enthusiasm for Jewish life which he imparted through his sermons, his teachings and his family life. He was a role model to all as he continued leading us while valiantly fighting his private battle with cancer this past year. While we were privileged to have him serve our congregation for a brief four years, he left an indelible impression in our hearts and minds. It is tragic that he did not live to see the realization and completion of his dream, the new Nursery and Hebrew School. Our deepest sympathies to his beloved wife, Julie, adored chidren, Gilad and Itai, his loving parents Rabbi Albert and Shirley Thaler, dear sisters Judy Kane (Rabbi Steven) and Dena Thaler (Steven Israel) and the entire bereaved family. The Sutton Place Synagogue family share their sorrow and mourn with them at this grievous time. We were indeed privileged to share the gift of life that was Richard Thaler. Robert W. Berend, President Philip Sassower, Exec. Comm. Chair Dov Keren, Cantor Harriet Janover, Exec. Director
