        FAIR-William R., M.D. The staff and leadership of Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center mourn the passing of our friend and colleague, William R. Fair, M.D., a noted urologic surgeon and former Chief of the Urology Service. Bill devoted his professional career to advancing the treatment of prostate cancer and, more recently, used his personal experiences to focus public discussion on the value of complementary medicine. Our thoughts are with his family. Harold Varmus, President David Golde, Physician-in-Chief Murray Brennan, Chairman, Department of Surgery Peter Scardino, Chairman, Department of Urology Victor Reuter, President, Medical Staff Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
