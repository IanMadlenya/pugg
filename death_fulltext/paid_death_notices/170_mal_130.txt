        TROSTEN-William. The American Jewish Committee mourns the passing of one its longest serving staff members, who played a critical role in the financial growth of the agency and in nurturing AJC's unique relationship with Germany. Mr. Trosten joined the AJC staff in 1957, and worked primarily in the campaign department, rising to Director of Development in 1974, Assistant Director in 1981, and then served as AJC's Associate Director from 1982 until his retirement in 1990.
