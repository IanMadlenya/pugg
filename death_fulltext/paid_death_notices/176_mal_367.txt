        BRENNAN-Francis Henry. Loving husband, brother, son, uncle and loyal friend. Senior Vice President and Limited Partner Cantor Fitzgerald. Victim of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. Born Sept. 25, 1950 in Brooklyn, NY. Frank grew up in Rockville Centre the eldest of six children of the late Frank Sr. and Mary Brennan. At 6'7'' and with a soft hook shot he was one of the stars of the legendary St. Agnes High School Basketball Team of the late 1960's where he was tabbed with the nickname Zelmo. Frank graduated from St. Agnes and went on to star at Quinnipiac College in Hamden, CT. While his stature made him hard to miss visually it was his good nature, sense of humor and generosity that separated Frank more than his physical prowess. After graduating from Quinnipiac Frank went on to manage and own several nightclubs on Long Island, most notably Solomon Grundy's of Bay Shore. In the early '80's Frank took his talents to Wall Street where he ultimately became one of the best and most well known Government Securities brokers. There are few in the business who haven't been touched by him. A longtime bachelor he found the love of his life and wed Barbara Hanley in 1988. Of all his successes Frank was most proud of his association with The New York Police and Fire Widow's and Children's Benefit Fund where he was recently named to the Board of Directors. Along with Barbara Brennan of Oak Beach, Long Island Frank is survived by his mother, Mary of New Canaan, CT and his brother Brian and sisters Kathleen Carey, Ellen Flaherty, Mary Jones and Sarah Jerome. The family requests that donations be made in Frank's name to The New York Police and Fire Widow and Children's Benefit Fund P.O. Box 3713, Grand Central Station, NY, NY 10163. A memorial service will be held Saturday September 29 at St. Agnes Cathedral in Rockville Centre at 9:45 AM.
