        STERN--Sheldon, February 20, 2007. Great friend, you will be missed by all. Your extraordinary wit, strength, zest for life, camaraderie and the ability to brighten a room by your presence will be remembered with admiration and love. Sunday football, golf, ''traprints'' can never be the same. The Stern Gang will never forget their champion and leader. Our love to Claire, Andrea and family. Rest in peace, dear Shelly, we will never forget you. Barbara and Myron Nelkin and Family
        $(6$)STERN--Shelly D. The members of The Stern Gang at Old Westbury Country Club, mourn the passing of our beloved leader. For over 30 years he inspired us with his innovative ideas, acerbic wit and boundless energy. He was our stand up comic, caustic commentator and brilliant organizer. He will be sorely missed.
