        WARRACK-James T. The Department of Psychiatry at Long Island College Hospital mourns the sudden passing of Mr. James T. Warrack, C.S.W., CASAC, Clinical Director of our Duffield Street Alcoholism Treatment Program in downtown Brooklyn. Mr. Warrack was a distinguished colleague, friend, mentor, and clinician who over his 12 year career with us made important contributions to improving services to high risk patient populations. He was a man of compassion and integrity, who never looked down on anyone unless it was to lend a helping hand. We are grateful for Mr. Warrack's tenure and extend our sincere condolences to his family
