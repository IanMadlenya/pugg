        LOVERRO--John F. On June 12, 2004. Beloved husband of Diane, devoted father of Frank, John, Anne and Thomas, adoring grandfather to Madison, RJ and Tessa and caring brother to Anita and Dorothy. More than anything else, our father loved his family. We will miss him dearly. A service was held at St. Luke's Episcopal Church in East Hampton on Wednesday, June 16, with the Rev. James H. Short presiding. The family asks that, in lieu of flowers, memorial contributions be made to the John F. Loverro Memorial Fund, C/O the Long Island Community Foundation, 1740 Old Jericho Turnpike, Jericho, NY 11753. Questions regarding contributions should be directed to Hazel Weiser at 516 681-5085.
