        SCHWEIGER-Lynn Earhart. The staff and Board of Directors of the Purchase Community House send their condolences to the family and friends of Mr. Lynn Earhart Schweiger of Hawthorne, NY. Mr. Schweiger passed away on October 15, 1998 after an all too short battle with a malignant brain tumor. He is survived by his wife, Joyce, son, Keith and daughter, Kerry Lynn and son in law Al Crosby. Mr. Schweiger grew up in Elkhart, Indiana and received his Undergraduate Degree at Purdue University. After being hired as the Director of the Purchase Community House in Purchase, New York in 1967, he completed his Master's Degree at Columbia University Teacher's College. Affectionately known as ''The Boss,'' his integrity, fairness and high standards are lasting legacies to all those who knew him. The safe and caring atmosphere he created for our children made the Community House ''a home away from home.'' Lynn, we love you, we miss you and in our hearts, the Community House will always be ''Lynn's House.'' Services will be held on Monday, October 19th at 11:00am at White Plains United Methodist Church, 252 Bryant Avenue, White Plains, NY. Reception to follow at the Purchase Community House, 3095 Purchase Street, Purchase, NY. In lieu of flowers, for contribution information please contact James Kelly at 914-949-2636.
