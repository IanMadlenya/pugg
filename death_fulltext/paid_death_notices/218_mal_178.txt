        ARENSON--Joseph T. We are deeply saddened by the passing of our beloved father, Joseph T. Arenson. The most devoted husband of Lucille Arenson, loving father of Lois and Aron Kressel and Steven and Brenda Arenson, loving grandfather of Melanie, Daniel and Perri Kressel, brother of Mrs. Emma Tugenhaft, Dr. David Arenson and Dr. Murray Arenson, adored uncle of Robert Tugenhaft, Carol Weiss, Judy Friedman and Louise Garrell and inspiration to many other family members, friends, colleagues and students. Lawyer, professor, author and lecturer, Joseph was a leader in his profession and a light to all who knew him. A tireless advocate for many charitable causes and organizations, from the United Jewish Appeal to the Catholic Diocese, from the Anti-Defamation League to Victims of the Holocaust, he leaves a legacy of goodness, truth, compassion and love.
        ARENSON--Joseph T. The officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Joseph T.

We extend our deepest sympathies to his beloved wife Lucille; to his children, Lois & Stephen; to his grandchildren; and to the entire family. Morris W. Offit, President Susan K. Stern, Chair of the Board John S. Ruskay, Exec. V.P. & C.E.O.
