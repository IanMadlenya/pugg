        PARKER--Shirley Margolin. We extend sincerest condolences to the Parker family: Jeff and Naava, Drew and Careena, Michael and Toby, Keith and Allison, Julie, Mrs. Razelle Margolin Wender and 17 beloved grandchildren, all of whom cherished and looked up to this Grand Dame of Memphis. Deeply proud of her family and seriously connected to her yiddishkeit, she will long be remembered by all for her elegance and charm. With a zest for life and concern for others, she displayed great courage and dignity. May the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
