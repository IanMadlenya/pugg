        KRUG-Phil. The Legal Services Staff Association grieves the tragic death of our beloved brother Phil Krug. A founding member of our Union and a passionate advocate for low-income New Yorkers for more than thirty years, Phil gave generously of his time, energy, intellect, friendship, and humor. His colleagues, clients, and community have suffered a huge loss, and our hearts go out to his mother, brother, and companion Amy. Mass on Monday, August 13, at 10:30 AM, St. Rosalie's Catholic Church, 31 East Montauk Highway, Hampton Bay, New York.
