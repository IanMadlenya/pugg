        BURROS--Stanley B. (Barry), NYC. We are deeply saddened by the passing of our dear friend, Stanley ''Barry'' Burros who died on December 20 after a courageous battle with prostate cancer. Following childhood residences in Waterbury, CT, and the Bronx, he ultimately chose Manhattan as his home, a place where he was always most content. Barry believed strongly in the dignity of every person and demonstrated honesty as a young man by ''coming out'' to his parents at age 18. He was an early activist in the NYC gay community and was pleased to be able to offer generous financial support to the Gay & Lesbian Community Center. From early years came numerous stories of life in NYC, some gay and some not. Several special favorites that he enjoyed telling time and time again centered upon a long friendship with his bridge partner, the legendary actress Tallulah Bankhead. As one might expect of an avid NY Times crossword player, he reveled in words, word play, puns, and limericks, many of which were of the Ogden Nash variety. Barry delighted in entertaining a large circle of friends with his vast store of limericks, some profound and witty and some silly such as ''I eat my peas with honey; I have done it all my life. I know that it tastes funny, but at least they stick to my knife.'' Barry Burros was a bright, generous man of integrity, wisdom, and wit who many turned to for advice. Always in good spirits, he served as a positive role model who comforted and cheered all who knew him. In wishing him a loving and gentle adieu from this paradoxically beautiful world, a host of friends and relatives share in memories of our ''forever young'' Barry Burros and want to express special thanks to Vince Menill and Gilbert Aleman for their loving support of him. Remembrance contributions may be directed to the Barry Burros Fund for Gay NYC Youth at the Gay & Lesbian Community Center, 208 West 13th Street, NY, NY 10011. A memorial service is being planned.
