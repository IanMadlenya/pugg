        CLOTT-George. The Officers and Members of the Board of Governors of the Jewish Home and Rehabilitation Center and the Jewish Home at Rockleigh note with profound sorrow the passing at age 92 of George Clott, Honorary Presi dent. George began a lifetime of support and devotion to the Jewish Home at the age of nine, and was committed to providing longterm care to those in need regardless of financial ability. His involvement will surely be missed. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife Gertude, our dear and valued friend, his children and his entire family. May his name be for a blessing. Carl Epstein, President Charles Berkowitz, Exec VP
