        APPELBAUM-Marion. On January 24, 2001, beloved wife of Bob, devoted daughter, sister, and aunt. What a wonderful battle she waged against a very aggressive cancer, finally succumbing with the same dignity with which she lived. Dearly loved by her family, her many friends, and her employees. Rest in peace, my darling, you've more than earned it.
