From Bergen Belsen her group was taken to Switzerland prior to the end of the war as part of a barter arrangement with Germany. From Switzerland she went to Prague where she was reunited with her husband in 1946. Rose, her husband and daughter arrived in New York in 1950 and she became an inveterate New Yorker. She got a job at the New York Public Library and to further her career studied at Columbia University where she earned an MLS in Library Science. She worked at the 42nd St. Public Library for more that 30 years. Rose loved New York and was very much a part of it attending the theatre, the opera, museums and loving all its vitality. However, she remained a lady of ''old Europe: formal, elegant and chic.'' In 1996 at the age of 90 she moved into the Salvation Army Williams Senior Residence, where for a good number of years she truly enjoyed herself. She had to move to the Amsterdam Nursing Home in September 2005 where she died. Survivors are her daughter Erika, son-in-law Michael Pearl, niece Eva Foltin, grandnieces Anne & Liz Foltin & nephew & niece Dennis and Lottie Miklos, and grandnephews David and Robert Miklos.
