        CHARNEY-Rabbi Lawrence. We record with sorrow the passing of our beloved colleague. Ordained in 1942, he served congregations in New York, Massachusetts and Chicago. He assumed the pulpit of Northwest Suburban Congregation (Chicago) in 1960 and became rabbi emeritus in 1985. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Lillian, children Brenda Rosen, Dr. Davida, David and our colleague, Rabbi Michael Charney and all who were touched through his rabbinate. Rabbi David L. Lieber, President Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Exec. VP The Rabbinical Assembly
