        FURET-Francois. The Kantor family notes with great sorrow the untimely death of Francois Furet, an extraordinary, brilliant, warm member of our family. We will remember him always for his love, his wit and his wonderful generous spirit. Most of all, his deep devotion to Deborah and Charlotte.
