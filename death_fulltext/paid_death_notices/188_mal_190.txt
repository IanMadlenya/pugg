        MACK-Rodger. The Syracuse University family mourns the passing of a dedicated teacher, renowned sculptor and respected friend and colleague. He began his 34 years at SU in 1968 as a professor of sculpture, and went on to serve as the first director of the School of Art and Design in the College of Visual and Performing Arts from 1982 to 1991. A bronze caster of international repute, he helped build the program, buildings and foundry that turned the school into a major educational art and design center. A 1991 recipient of a Chancellor's Citation for Exceptional Academic Achievement, he received numerous awards, grants and honors including those from the Ford Foundation, the National Foundation for the Arts and the New York State Council on the Arts, as well as a Fulbright Grant for study in Italy. Our heartfelt condolences to his family, loved ones and scores of professional artists and graduate students across the world who regard him as their mentor.
