        HEITNER-Emanuel. After 97 joyful years. Husband of the late Rose Smolin Heitner; and survived by his son and daughter-in-law, Michael and Susan Heitner of Brooklyn, N.Y., and by his grandson Samuel Kip Heitner and his wife Vanessa Guibert Heitner of Arlington, VA. Following a happy boyhood on the streets of Brooklyn and graduation from Boys High School, Manny Heitner later became owner and chief executive of Gotham Carpet Corp and was prominent in the decorator floor covering industry in New York City for many years. He was truly devoted to and beloved by his family, friends and associates.
        HEITNER-Emanuel. We are all grateful that the father of our dear partner Michael Heitner was blessed many times over. A long and wonderful life, a marriage made in heaven to his beloved Rose, of blessed memory, a son and daughter, Michael and Susie, who could not have been more loving, caring and devoted, and an adoring grandson, Sam, whose recent marriage to Vanessa added another twinkle to his ever-merry eyes. To Mr. Heitner, every day was a cause for celebration-his smile and eternally sunny disposition told you that all was right with the world. His cherubic countenance will remain in our memories forever. Our deepest sympathy and heartfelt condolences go out to the Heitner family on its great loss. Herrick, Feinstein LLP
