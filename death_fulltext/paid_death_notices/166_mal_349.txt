        RUBIN-Joseph. The Yeshiva University family and the affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary Board of Trustees are saddened by the passing of a longtime friend-a dynamic leader, generous supporter, and champion of the YU High Schools. He and his beloved wife, Rosalind, are High School Fellows (Bonim). We extend our heartfelt condolences to Rosalind; children, Arleen Rubin (and Jeffrey Klores) and Barry (and Michelle) Rubin; sister, Sylvia Zharnest; grandchildren; and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University Robert M.
