She was the beloved partner of Marcia Landsman, mother of Emma Ying and sister of Sara Sanderson. She was born in Arkansas and raised in Kentucky where she received a Ph.D. in psychology. Cindy was an expert and talented clinical psychologist, serving much of her career at New York Presbyterian Hospital in White Plains. Most recently, she was the Director of Training of Behavioral Tech, LLC. She was an avid reader of science and religion, an outstanding teacher, writer and mentor. She was kind, generous, extremely funny and had a fierce will. Cindy is survived by her partner and daughter, sisters Sara and Connie, brothers David and Herb, nieces Sara, Emma, Rachel, Leslie and Hannah, nephews Jesse, Lane and Austin. She was grateful for the compassion and devotion of her doctors and all those who helped her through all of the medical and personal struggles in her life. She lived a vital life filled with great love for her daughter, family and friends. Some months before Cindy's death, she wrote to a friend, ''I stood out on the back porch this afternoon and I prayed for the peace and grace to accept this life on its own terms...to have the courage and the will to do just that.'' In the end, she was able to find peace in this strife. She will be loved and missed forevermore.
