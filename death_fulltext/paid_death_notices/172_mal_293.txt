        SHEARER-Lloyd. The staff of Parade magazine mourns the loss of a friend and colleague. For more than three decades (1958-1991), Parade editor-at-large Lloyd Shearer educated, entertained and informed millions of Americans through one of the best-read and enduring columns in magazine history: ''Walter Scott's Personality Parade.'' Using that famous pseudonym, Shearer raised gossip to a fine art and was considered the authority on world-wide celebrity. He brought us the very latest in the King of rock-n-roll to the Queen of England-and everyone in between. He was also the author of Parade's weekly ''Intelligence Report,'' another favorite that continues today. His work helped define the magazine and made a mark on America. We will miss him. We extend our sympathies to his wife, Marva, his children and grandchildren. Walter Anderson, Publisher
