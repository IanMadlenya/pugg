        DUNDY-Harold David, M.D. 89, died peacefully on September 28 in his home with his children and grandchildren at his side. A wily bridge player, avid Mets fan, devotee of Brooklyn Botanical Gardens, Harold was a powerful force in our lives. His tenacity, tolerance and wit endure as an inspiration to all who knew and loved him.
