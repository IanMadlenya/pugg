        REISMAN-Frank Bennett, 41, cruelly and tragically taken from his dearly loved and loving family and friends in the terrorist attack September 11 on the World Trade Center. Frank is survived and will be sorely missed by his cherished wife, Gayle, his darling children, Kasey 11 and Dillon 9, and by his loving parents, Evie and George. He was a most dear son-in-law to George and Bea Kleinman as well as a very special brother-in-law to Elise and Dr. Harvey Weingarten, Loren and Jill Kleinman and an adored uncle of Stacey, Benjamin, Dawn, Cari, and Jason. Wherever he went he made friends; with his kindness, sweet nature, sense of humor, intellectual quickness, and sincere interest in people he was the exemplar of the term ''GreatGuy''. Frank attended The Elisabeth Morrow School, he graduated in '77 from Dwight-Englewood School and earned a B.A. at Skidmore College in the Class of 1981. Following college and a ''tune-up'' of winter mountaineering in the Adirondacks High Peaks he hiked the Northern section of the Appalachian Trail from Maine to Pennsylvania and then joined his family's manufacturing company, Natalie Lamp & Shade Corp. Afterwards, he was an equities trader with Franklin Resources and for the last 5 years has been at Cantor Fitzgerald's trading desk on the 104th floor of the WTC. A memorial service will be held at 2:30 PM on Sunday, September 23 at The Jewish Center, 435 Nassau Street, Princeton, New Jersey.
