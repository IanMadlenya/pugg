        STANTON--Dr. Frank, the trustees, staff and volunteers of the Educational Broadcasting Corporation (EBC) licensee of Thirteen/WNET and WLIW New York, mourn the passing of Dr. Frank Stanton, a television pioneer and passionate defender of the First Amendment rights of broadcasters. A legend in the world of commercial television, Dr. Stanton was also a guiding force in New York public television. Often called ''A guardian angel'' of Thirteen/ WNET, he played an instrumental role in giving the station its start in 1962 and served for many years on EBC's Board of Trustees. In 1988, he was named Honorary Trustee and in 1994, he became a Life Trustee. In the late 1990s, Dr. Stanton helped launch Thirteen/WNET into a new era by generously supporting the station's transition to digital broadcasting. When Thirteen/WNET inaugurated its new headquarters in midtown Manhattan in 1998, it was Dr. Stanton who switched on the state-of-theart digital master control, stating, ''In 50 years of television, I've never turned a station on before.'' That may have been technically true, but in our minds, a little of his brilliance and spark have illuminated every television station in America. Frank Stanton will be profoundly missed by broadcasters everywhere and especially by all of us here at EBC. James S. Tisch Chairman William F. Baker President
