        FREED--Ethan. With a profound sense of grief the Camp Winadu family mourns the loss of Ethan Freed. Ethan was a model son, brother, grandson, camper, student, athlete and friend. Everyone who knew him loved and respected his ability to find peaceful solutions to all situations. Ethan truly made a difference during his life. We extend our deepest sympathy to his parents Susan and Jeffrey, his brothers Adam and Alex, his grandparents and extended family.
