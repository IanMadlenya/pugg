        FLUELLEN-Thom. The NYU community grieves for the loss of Thom Fluellen. Throughout the University and its neighborhoods, Thom was admired for his charm, his decency and his kind manner and he brought a high level of professionalism to all he did on behalf of the University. He was taken from us too soon and too suddenly, and we feel his absence keenly. His loved ones are in our thoughts at this sad time.
