        MESINGER-Maxine. The Board of Directors and staff of the American Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR) mourn the loss of our cherished friend and Board Member, who passed away on January 19, 2001. While we grieve, we also celebrate Maxine Mesinger's many extraordinary qualities, which we had come to know so well. Ms. Mesinger joined the Board of amfAR in 1994 and contributed actively to the Foundation in many ways. Most notibly, she spearheaded an enormously successful Houston concert series that generated nearly 2 million dollars for amfAR's AIDS research programs. Ms. Mesinger's steadfast commitment to the principle of humane and compassionate treatment for all, her generosity of spirit, and her willingness to do whatever she could for a worthy cause made her a dynamic and indispensable member of the Foundation. Our thoughts are with her husband. Emil, and all of her family. Mathilde Krim, Ph.D, Founding Chair and Chairman of the Board Jerome J. Radwin, CEO American Foundation for AIDS Research
