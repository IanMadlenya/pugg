        ROSENSTEIN--Neil. It is with great sadness that the family of Neil Rosenstein reports his death. Neil was courageous, optimistic and determined in his sudden and brief battle with pancreatic cancer. He died Saturday, August 9th, at home in Carmel, CA at the age of 77. Born in The Bronx in 1926 to Adele and Arnold Rosenstein, Neil was a proud alumna of the City College of New York, class of 1942 (BBA). An enthusiastic and proud New Yorker for 43 years, Neil resided in Manhattan and Long Island before relocating to Beverly Hills,CA in 1969. He lived in Beverly Hills for 25 years until his retirement to Carmel, CA. Neil had a varied and successful business career, including being Chairman of the Board of National Sugar Refining Company (1969-1971), and Founder, Chairman and President of Jackpot Enterprises, Inc from 1980-1993. He is deeply loved by his family and will be remembered as a kind and generous man with an extraordinary sense of humor and charismatic charm. He was a student of history, a patriot, an avid reader, an indefatigable sports fan, a world traveler, art collector, lover of opera, poker and backgammon and a below average golfer. Neil was a brilliant man who left us too soon. Beloved husband of Miriam, his wife of 53 years; devoted father to Arnold Rosenstein, Carol Rosenstein, and Diane Rosenstein; loving grandfather of Brian Rosenstein and Katharine Rose Polk. Services will be private. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Community Hospital of Monterey Peninsula or the Jules Stein Eye Institute at UCLA.
