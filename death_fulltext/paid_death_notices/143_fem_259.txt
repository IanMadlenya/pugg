        GROSS-Lynn. Community School Board 28 Queens and the entire District 28 School Community, express sorrow at the passing of our esteemed colleague and beloved friend. As an educator, long-term Board Member and past President of School Board 28, she devoted her life to the educational betterment of our community's children. Her intelligent and caring leadership, grace and drive will be sorely missed.
