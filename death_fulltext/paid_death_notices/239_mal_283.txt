        REICHMAN--Jack Z'ev Ph.D, ASA 56 of West Hempstead, NY died Monday at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital. Beloved husband of Rosalyn Ebrahimoff, devoted father of Menashe, Rocky, and Gili Reichman. Son of his dear father Richie (Herman) and the late Lillian Reichman, brother of Sureen Rothbaum and Katriel Reichman. A devoted and loyal employee of Standard & Poor's for many years, Jack was known by many and respected by all. A professor and actuary in previous positions, his patience and skill in guiding many of our employees as well as his pride in his own work made him a very valued member of the insurance practice. Jack was totally selfless in his desire to help others without asking for anything in return. He was loved by everyone who met him. His zest for life and his wonderful attitude will be missed by all. Funeral Wednesday at 2:30pm at Schwartz Brothers 114-06 Queens Boulevard with burial to follow in Israel. Shiva will be observed by the family at Jack's last residence starting Sunday until Wednesday morning. May the family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. In lieu of flowers and food, the family requests that donations in Jack's memory be made to Israeli charities, cancer charities or any organization that feeds the poor.
