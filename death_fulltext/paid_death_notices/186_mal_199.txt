        MCCARTHY - Michael A. Cornell University mourns the loss of a close friend and graduate, Michael A. McCarthy. Throughout his long and distinguished architectural career with Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, Michael designed sophisticated mixed use buildings, office complexes and residences. His major projects include the Islamic Cultural Center of NY, the expansion of Dulles Airport in VA and the Chancery for the State of Kuwait in Washington D.C. Michael also enjoyed a long and productive relationship with Chase Manhattan Bank, for whom he designed several buildings in the NY area and its branches in Europe, Japan and Latin America. In retirement, he mentored young designers and took a keen interest in architectural education. He donated his professional papers to Cornell, where he also served on the Cornell Unversity Council and the College of Architecture, Art and Planning's Advisory Board. Michael was a valued associate of many generations of alumni and faculty, a devotee of the college and the most stalwart of its supporters. Members of the college and alumni express our sincere condolences to Mr. McCarthy's sister, Susan C. McCarthy, his colleagues and co-workers and his many friends.
