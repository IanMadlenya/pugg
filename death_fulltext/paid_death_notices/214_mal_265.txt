        PHILLIPS--Lynn, Jr., my dad, died Saturday, November 13th. Red Smith of the NY Herald Tribune described dad as ''A pleasant man, cheerfully friendly, handsomely and quietly dressed, impeccably scrubbed and barbered.'' He was that and much more. A loving husband and father, he and my mom Mary made their home on E. 57th St. for more than 50 years. During WW II Dad served in the Army signal corps; he spent his career in sales and marketing. Known for his quick wit, he loved to make people laugh. He excelled on both the piano and the backgammon board. Dad moved to Florida after mom died in 1991. There he was blessed with two special relationships: one with his caretaker Patty Brigham, the daughter he never had, and one with Marge Bazin, the romance of his final years. He is survived by my wife Kathie and me (Mike), his brother Chick, his grandchildren Lisa, Pam, Amy and Brian and his great grandchildren Kevin, Ashley and Brian. A future service will be held in NYC.
