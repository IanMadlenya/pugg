        STERN-Gershon. The family of Edith Agus and the late Dr. Haim Agus joins its lifelong friends, the family of Merle Stern, in mourning the passing of Gershon, a beloved husband, father, grandfather and friend. For 50 years, the lives of the Agus and Stern families were entwined. Our hearts reach out to Merle, his beloved wife, to his beloved children, Sharon and William Hyman, Jonathan and Kris Stern, Judith and David Lobel, to his beloved grandchildren, Caroline, Alexandra, Andrew, and Zachary and to his brother, Zalman, and his wife, Barbara. In addition to all the great occasions we shared with the Stern family, we shared its pride in Gershon's deep devotion to charitable causes and in his many philanthropic achievements in Canada, in the U.S. and Israel. A graduate of Yeshiva University, he and his beloved wife, Merle, ultimately endowed a chair at its business school. He was a great man with a great spirit, full of generosity, devotion and gratitude, widely admired and loved, who will be missed by the many he impressed so deeply in his lifetime. May his name be remembered always as a blessing. Mrs. Edith Agus Dr. Bert and Shoshana Agus Dr. Saul and Marcelle Agus Stephen and Linda Agus
