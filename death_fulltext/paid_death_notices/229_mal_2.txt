        COUPER--Richard W. The trustees and staff of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation grieve the passing of a respected colleague and faithful friend who was a dedicated trustee from 1975 to 1994. Richard Couper not only understood and supported the Foundation's goals and ideals, but also had an enduring commitment to gifted artists, scholars, and scientists. We are fortunate to have had the opportunity and privilege of working with this engaging man, who had such a deep feeling for public service. All of us at the Foundation extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Patsy, and to the members of their family. Joseph A. Rice Chairman, Board of Trustees Edward Hirsch President and Trustee Joel Conarroe Pres. Emeritus and Trustee
