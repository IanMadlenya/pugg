        ROSNER-Fred. Beloved Fritz-a gentle beacon of kindness, a heart of infinite generosity, a surrogate uncle to we who gathered around him, a teacher, a mentor, a friend. Neither sorrow nor adversity could erase the twinkle from his eyes, and we will hold dear his boundless warmth forever. Cheryl and Michael Keller
