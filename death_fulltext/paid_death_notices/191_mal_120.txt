        PERL-Alan F. In Sarasota, FL, December 7, age 93. Born and raised in New York, he attended Columbia College and Law School. He served as a staff attorney in the early days of the National Labor Relations Board rising to direct the New York regional office. In this period he tried cases that established many of the rights of organized labor that we now take for granted. In 1947, he was a founding partner of the firm Sturm & Perl, specializing in labor law. He was a life-long defender of the downtrodden and disenfranchised. For many years he served as an advisor on labor matters to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and helped establish a system for equitable treatment of migrant farm workers. Married for 50 years to the late Florence Perl, he is survived by his daughter, Emily Perl Kingsley, his son, Dr. Daniel Perl (Eleanor), three grandchildren, Erica Perl, Dr. Alexander Perl and Jason Kingsley, one greatgrandchild, and his companion, Connie Goldstein. A truly remarkable man, he will be greatly missed by all who knew him. Burial is private. A memorial celebration of his life is planned for January.
