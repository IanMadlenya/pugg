        MICHEL-Henry. The Columbia Engineering School Alumni Association mourns the passing of our cherished friend, Past President, & alumni leader, Henry L. Michel. He was esteemed and honored by the Alumni Association and Columbia University as a great engineer and internationally known construction leader. He was the only alumnus ever awarded both the Egleston Medal for distinguished engineering achievement and the Pupin Medal for service to the nation in engineering, science or technology. We shall miss him as a friend and mentor to alumni and students. We express our condolences to his wife, Mary Elizabeth and to his daughters, Ann and Eve. Tullio J. Borri, President, CESAA
