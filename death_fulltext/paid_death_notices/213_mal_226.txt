        RUESCH--Otto Josef. The Trustees and Staff of the Corcoran Gallery of Art and College of Art and Design mourn the loss of their longtime friend and Chairman and extend their sympathies to his wife Jeanne and his sons Matthew and Christoph. As a member of the Board and as Chairman, Otto brought boundless energy and goodness to every task, inspiring everyone who met him. A visionary philanthropist, he lived an exemplary life of service to the international arts community and to innumerable worthy social causes. He gave unsparingly of his time and energy to ensure the future growth of the Corcoran. His presence will always be felt in the galleries of its museum and in the studios of its college. We are deeply grateful for the privilege of knowing and working with this extraordinary man, whose generosity of spirit will, forever leave its mark on our institution and our city.
