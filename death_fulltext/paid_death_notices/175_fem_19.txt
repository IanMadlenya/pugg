        MULLER-Silvia A. Widow of Dr. Erwin T. Muller, died on Wednesday morning July 25, 2001. She is survived by her nephew William Proops of Edmonds, WA, by her grandniece and nephews, her step-grandchildren, adopted family and a host of others who loved her dearly. A true lady, she was always curious about the world and delighted in young people. Though a retired teacher, she never stopped learning and teaching by example. She took charge of her life, was considerate of all those around her, and leaves those of us who knew and loved her deeply saddened at her passing. She was the best this world has to offer.
