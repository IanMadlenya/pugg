        ROSENFELD - Rabbi Leonard. The entire Yeshiva University family is saddened by the sudden passing away of one of the most senior and outstanding alumni of Yeshiva College ('37) and the affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary ('40). A distinguished educator and former head of the New York Board of Jewish Education, he served in pulpits in the United States and for the last decades he lived in Israel. He was a man of exemplary character and learning. We offer our heartfelt condolences to his wife Rosalie, to his son Ezra (YC '77), his daughter Tirzah (SCW '67) and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University Robert M. Beren, Chairman Yeshiva University Board of Trustees
