        BRITTON-Wright, age 74, died of pancreatic cancer, on Saturday, April 29, 2000. He bravely battled his formidable foe for six months, and the courage and dignity he brought to his last days reflected the values that he embodied throughout his extraordinary life. He received his Ph.D. in maritime history from the University of Pennsylvania and taught in the Department of American Civilization at Rutgers University and the Department of History at the University of Pennsylvania. He was an expert in high latitude sailing and wrote numerous articles for scholarly journals and sailing magazines. Among his many awards was the Blue Water Medal of the Cruising Club of America for his voyage to Greenland. He also sailed on flag-carrying expeditions for the Explorers Club and National Geographic. On many of his voyages he worked on research projects for Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Canadian and U.S. Hydrographic Departments and American Museum of Natural History among others. He raced his boat in the trans-Atlantic Yacht Race to Sweden, as well as in many other ocean yacht races. For many years he served on the House Committee of the New York Yacht Club. He was an Ensign in the U.S. Navy during World War II. We shall miss his warmth, wit and prodigious intelligence. He was a consummate gentleman and will always be remembered with enormous affection and a deep sense of loss. Survived by his loving wife of 40 years, Pat, and a brother, Mason Britton Jr., Southport, Maine. Contributions may be sent to The Hill School, Pottstown, PA 19464. A memorial service will be held at a later date. ''His life was gentle; and the elements so mix'd in him, that Nature might stand up, and say to all the world, 'This was a man.'''
