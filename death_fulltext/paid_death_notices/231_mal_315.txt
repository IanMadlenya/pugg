        SEHAM--Martin Charles. A labor attorney who gracefully bridged the ideological chasm between unions and management, died on Saturday, April 1, of heart failure at Englewood Hospital, New Jersey. A Brooklyn boy of modest means, Mr. Seham graduated from Amherst College in 1954, summa cum laude. At Harvard Law School he served as an editor on the Harvard Law Review. In the contentious field of labor relations, Mr. Seham obtained the confidence of management and labor. His practice included representation of both foreign flag airlines and several independent labor organizations. Mr. Seham was also a well-established figure in the maritime industry, where he served as General Counsel to the preeminent multi-employer bargaining association for the industry. His public service included a three-year term as Chairman of the New York City Public Utility Board; membership on the board of the Bergen County Urban League; and management of Hubert Humphrey's presidential campaign in northern New Jersey. Mr. Seham is survived by his devoted wife Phoebe, children Amy, Jenny, Lee and Lucy, and six grandchildren.
