        NUSSBAUM - Jacqueline Ruth (nee Cohen). Died October 21, after an illness. She is survived by a sister, Elizabeth Hittner, two daughters Debra Nussbaum Cohen and Laura Solomon, their husbands, Marc Cohen and Mark Solomon, and five grandchildren. Jacqueline was 62. She was a gracious, generous and loving woman whose thoughtfulness and warmth touched everyone who knew her. Her favorite role was as Grandma Peaches to her beloved and cherished grandchildren Aryeh, Aliza and Elana, Avi and Adin. She mustered everything she had in order to be here for them. Sadly for us, the Creator had other plans. Shiva will be observed at her daughters' homes in Brooklyn and Philadelphia. Donations may be made to the Philadelphia Jewish Family and Childrens Services, 7607 Old York Rd., Elkins Park, PA 19027.
