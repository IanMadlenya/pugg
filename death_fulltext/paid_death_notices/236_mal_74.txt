        BLINDER--Richard. The Center for Jewish History mourns the passing of its architect Richard Blinder whose talent, vision and skill created a historic and cultural environment for preserving and presenting the Jewish experience. He will be greatly missed, but his vision will serve as an inspiration for all of those who work and visit the Center, reflecting upon his genius. Bruce Slovin, Chairman Center for Jewish History
