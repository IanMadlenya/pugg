        BURG-Yosef. The Officers and Staff of United Jewish Communities deeply mourn the passing of Dr. Yosef Burg, a great Israeli leader and patriot who devoted his life to Zionism and the Jewish people. Dr. Burg was one of Israel's most respected public figures who served for many years in the Knesset, as well as in numerous Israeli governments. Dr. Burg was a tireless and devoted advocate for Israel-Diaspora relations. His lifelong commitment to the sanctity of Jewish peoplehood is carried on by his son, Avraham Burg, Speaker of the Knesset and former Chairman of the Jewish Agency for Israel. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his entire family. May they be comforted among those who mourn for Zion and Jerusalem. Charles R. Bronfman, Chairman of the Board Joel D. Tauber, Chairman of the Executive Committee Carole Solomon, National Campaign Chairman Stephen D. Solender, President and CEO
