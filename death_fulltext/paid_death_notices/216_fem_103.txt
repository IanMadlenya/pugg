        LINTON--Laurie Ann. On January 10, 2005, in New York City, at the age of 46, after a long illness. Laurie is survived by her brother Robert, her longtime companion, Murphy, and a host of beloved friends. Laurie was a native--and devoted--New Yorker. A graduate of Hunter College High School, Wesleyan University, and Columbia Law School, Laurie began as a litigator at Weil, Gotshal & Manges. She then turned her attention to the public sector, where she spent the remainder of her career dedicated to serving the people of New York. In positions with the Attorney General's Office, the NYC Human Resources Administration, the NYC Comptroller's Office, and as counsel to the Governor's Office under Mario Cuomo, Laurie's work affected everything from campaign finance legislation to welfare reform, the state budget to charities fraud. Laurie's contribution as an activist in the gay and lesbian community was, if possible, even more profound. She was a founder and board member of the Empire State Pride Agenda, and was instrumental in their work to pass both the Hate Crimes Bill and the Sexual Orientation Nondiscrimination Act. She also served as a Director of the Lesbian and Gay Law Association of Greater New York, and was, until her death, Vice President of the Stonewall Community Foundation's Board of Directors. The vast legion of people who counted her as their very good friend will miss her, and they would agree: her enormous love of life was surpassed only by her generosity of spirit. A memorial service will be held Wednesday, January 12, at 9:30am at ''The Riverside,'' 76 St & Amsterdam Ave. In lieu of flowers, Laurie wished donations to be made to the Stonewall Community Foundation.
