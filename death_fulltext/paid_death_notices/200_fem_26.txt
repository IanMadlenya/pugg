        OSLER--Julie Ann. Age 56, passed away in Chicago, September 3, 2003, from the devastating effects of a stroke she suffered nearly five years ago. She was a daughter of the late David Osler and Grace Osler Sonenblick and the sister of Susan Osler and Jordan Metzger, Sagaponack, NY. and Amy Osler and Michael Lowenthal of Chicago, IL. She also leaves her loving and beloved nieces, in New York, Dana Brockman and Abby Brockman and in Chicago, Dr. Lydia Sharp and Joanna Sharp and her wonderful caregiver Lily. Julie's loving and giving spirit, her love of classical music, cooking and photography, brought joy to those whose paths she crossed. It breaks our hearts we were unable to make the world a better place for our sweet and unassuming Jewel. We all lose. Her presence, her vitality, her voice has been silenced much too soon. We will miss her always. Memorial contributions in Julie's name can be made to the Animal Welfare Society in New Milford, CT. or the 92nd Street Y School of Music. Memorial to be announced.
