        NEWMAN--Anne Margulies. Died peacefully at home in West Palm Beach March 6, 2005, at age 91. Beloved wife of 56 years of the late Dr. Herbert Newman. Devoted mother of Robert, Donald and Carol, cherished motherin-law of Vivien, and loving friend of long-term caregiver Delores Waite. A child of immigrants, Anne was first in her family to attend college and served as a role model for her younger female cousins. She graduated cum laude in one of the first classes at Brooklyn College. Voted ''Most Energetic'' by her classmates, her life proved them correct--in education, public service and the arts. Anne obtained a Masters Degree in Health Education from Columbia University and joined the Brooklyn College faculty where she inspired generations of students, ultimately retiring as Professor Emerita. During her distinguished career, she was active in the leadership of municipal health organizations in New York City and of the Kadimah chapter of Hadassah at the East Midwood Jewish Center in Brooklyn. In retirement in West Palm Beach, FL, she was instrumental in installing and leading a Brooklyn College Alumni Association chapter and remained active in professional and synagogue activities. She was an awardwinning weaver and creative in many art forms throughout her life. A graveside service will be held at Knollwood Cemetery, Ridgewood, NY, Sunday, March 13 at 1 PM. Contributions may be made to the Anne & Herbert Newman Scholarship at the Brooklyn College Foundation, 718951-5074.
