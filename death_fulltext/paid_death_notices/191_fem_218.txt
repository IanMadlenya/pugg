        FLUG-Fortunee nee Husney. Mother, you brought me into this world and gave me the warmest welcome a son could have been given. You were by my side for the good times and the bad times. Nothing was ever too much for you. I watched you struggle for quite a few years. Finally it was just too difficult. You were there for my first breath of life, I was there for your last. I watched you go to Heaven. I will think of you and speak of you every day. The love you have given me will never die. You are the beat in my heart. Robert
        FLUG-Fortunee. December 24. She was an exceptionally devoted grandmother and a constant source of love. She will be remembered for her great sense of humor, Syrian cooking, and beautiful voice. She left an indelible mark on the spirit of her family. Owen Mazon
        FLUG-Fortunee. In loving memory of Fortunee, you will always be remembered for your kindness and love. Our thoughts are with your family. Josephine, Ariel and Aaron Chaus
