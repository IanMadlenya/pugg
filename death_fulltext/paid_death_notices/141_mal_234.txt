        MEYERSON-David Nathan. The President, Chancellor, Boards of Governors and Overseers, faculty, administration and students, of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion express our heartfelt condolences to our beloved Governor, Morton H. Meyerson and Marlene Meyerson, devoted parents of David and members of the HUC family on the untimely and tragic death of their son. As it is written in the Book of Lamentations, our ''eyes are spent with tears, our hearts are in tumult, our being melts away.'' May his memory be a comfort to all those who mourn him, his dear parents and sister, family and friends. May God comfort them together with all those who mourn for Zion and Jerusalem. Rabbi Sheldon Zimmerman, Pres. Burton Lehman, Chair, Board of Governors
