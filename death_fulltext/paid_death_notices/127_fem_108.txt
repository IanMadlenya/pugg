        McDOWELL-Peggy. Peggy became of counsel to the Family Law Center upon her retirement from the Legal Aid Society, Civil Division. In November 1996, she immediately became actively involved in our Family Law Practice, for working poor people, on a daily basis, while at the same time establishing an immigration practice and assisting foster children to become adopted children. She approched every case with enthusiasm and brought each client a professional confidence that will be unmatched. She was a living law library and a live-in law professor. Although her time with us was short her impact was long. We shall miss her immeasurably. From your Family Law Center family. Pat Fersch, Catherine Cornelius, John Perlich
