        EISENSTEIN-Rabbi Ira. We record with profound sadness the passing of our honored and deeply respected teacher and colleague, past president (1952-54) of the Rabbinical Assembly, who through classroom, written word, and tireless dedication left an enduring legacy upon contemporary Jewish life. He was rabbi of the Society of the Advancement of Judaism in New York City and founding rabbi of the North Shore Reconstructionist Congregation on Long Island which he served until he became rabbi emeritus. He was the founder of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College and president of the Jewish Reconstructionist Federation. He is the author of numerous works including Judaism Under Freedom and Reconstructing Judaism. We express our deepest condolences to his children, Ethan, Miriam, and Ann and to all who were touched through his rabbinate.
