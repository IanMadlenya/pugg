        STRATTA-M. Cecile. In profound sorrow, the devoted sons of M. Cecile Stratta announce her passing on June 8, 1998. Over four decades, Cecile developed a successful and renowned foreign language translation and interpreting business, through which she enjoyed assignments and experiences which extended far beyond the New York area. Cecile's incredible strength and dignity as she battled a long and difficult illness inspired all those who came in contact with her. She had an insatiable curiosity and appetite for life. Her special wisdom, endless generosity and love will be deeply missed by all who had the privilege to know her and be touched by her. Cecile will be honored in a special Celebratory Memorial Service at 3 PM, Saturday, June 20, at Christ and St. Stephens' Church, West 69th St., between Broadway and Columbus. All of Cecile's many friends and colleagues are invited to attend to remember and celebrate her very special life.
        STRATTA-Cecile Horner. June 8, 1998. Beloved friend, you will live forever in our thoughts and our hearts. Anna and Wolfgang Saxon
