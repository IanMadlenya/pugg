        TASHKOVICH-Virginia (nee Harlow). On April 14, 2000. Beloved wife of the late Gligor and stepmother of the late Vuko and Otto, loving mother-in-law of Stefanie and Cassandre and grandmother of Felicia, Mark and Gligor Tashkovich. Known professionally as Virginia Harlow, she had a long career as an interior decorator. She brought a sense of integrity to her work. The rooms she created were warm and welcoming. She was an elegant woman and a trustworthy friend. She enjoyed witty conversation, visits with young children, games of bridge and Scrabble and long walks in Pound Ridge. We will all miss her kindess. In lieu of flowers contributions may be made to the Tashkovich Scholarship Fund, Office of University Development, 55 Brown Road, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14850-1247.
