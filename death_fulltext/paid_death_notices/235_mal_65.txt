        GODSICK--Steven Jay. It is with great sadness that the Trustees and staff of the New York City Police Foundation mourn the passing of our longtime friend, Steve. He brought wise counsel, diligent work and much laughter to our office. We will sorely miss him. Our thoughts are with the entire Godsick family. Valerie Salembier, Chair Pamela D. Delaney, Pres.
