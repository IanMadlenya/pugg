        HIRSCHLAND-Ellen Berney. The Board of Trustees and staff of the Heckscher Museum of Art note with profound sorrow the passing of our former Trustee, long time friend and supporter, Ellen Hirschland. As a member of the Collections/Exhibitions Committee of the Board and as an art historian, art collector and donor, Ellen helped shape the Heckscher's collections and acquisitions policies. A long time resident of Long Island, Mrs. Hirschland actively encouraged an appreciation of art and artists and enriched the lives of many. She will be deeply missed. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to her children and grandchildren. Catherine A. Jansen, Chairman, Board of Trustees John E. Coraor, Ph.D., Director
