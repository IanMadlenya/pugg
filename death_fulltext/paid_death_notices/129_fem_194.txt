        EISENSTEIN-Ruth. The community of West End Synagogue is saddened by the death of our founding member, beloved wife of Myron (z''l), adored mother of Paula and Stephen, Hester and Michael, Jethro and Stefany; cherished grandmother of Hannah, Sarah, Max and Leo; and doting great-grandmother of Leah and Rachel. A long-time and staunch Reconstructionist, Ruth was an activist in always urging us to be better, aim at higher standards and avoid taking the easy paths. Her example, her presence and her smile will be sorely missed. Rabbi Avi Winokur Cantor Kathy Barr Donald Shapiro, Chair West End Synagogue
