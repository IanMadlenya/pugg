        ROSENBUSH -- Roslyn, on July 17, from complications of Parkinson's Disease. She endured her long illness with grace and without complaint. She was a person of gentle demeanor, and her ways were always soft and mild, and never harsh. Her passing leaves a void. She was greatly loved and will be missed. For those who cherished her, there remains an aching heart. Special thanks and appreciation is given to the people from the Westbury Hospice who gave her aid and comfort while she declined. She is survived by her husband Monroe; sons Mark and Richard; brother-in-law Al; daughters-in-law Susan Kwan and Sandy Bailey; grandchildren Jacob, Max, Anna, Katie and Kyle. >>AD#
