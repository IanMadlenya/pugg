        GOLDSTEIN--Ann. We are deeply saddened over the death of Ann Goldstein, beloved mother of our good friend, Dr. Matthew Goldstein, esteemed Guest of Honor for the forthcoming American Friends of The Open University of Israel Annual Gala, later this month in New York. The loss of one's beloved mother is more than merely heartfelt; it is painful to the very core in each of us who cherishes the unique and unconditional love, comfort and guidance bestowed by one's mother, from infancy and childhood into adult life. We extend our deepest sympathy to Matthew and the entire Goldstein family. We know the unique educational leadership and accomplishments of Matthew Goldstein imbued her life with motherly pride and fulfillment. May her memory be for a blessing. Jeffrey S. Wiesenfeld, Gala Chair Irwin Hochberg, Chair Sen. Seymour Lachman, VP Eric Heffler, Exec. VP American Friends of The Open University of Israel
