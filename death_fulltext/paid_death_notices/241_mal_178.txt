        DODGE--Cleveland E. (Clee) Jr. Teachers College, Columbia University, extends its sympathies to the family of Cleveland E. Dodge, the longtime philanthropist and industrialist who passed away in January. Through his decades of leadership of the Cleveland H. Dodge Foundation, established by his grandfather in 1917, Mr. Dodge has been a powerful force for the public good, supporting many New York City charities. The College salutes his family's ongoing involvement in the history, leadership and development of our institution. Susan H. Fuhrman, President Teachers College, Columbia University John C. Hyland, William D. Rueckert, Co-Chairs, Teachers College Board of Trustees
