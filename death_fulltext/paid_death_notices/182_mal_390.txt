        SCHWARTZ-Bernard. A dear sweet man left us in an instant Sunday, March 24. Loving husband of Sally, adoring father of Steffi Hausfater (Jere) and Nancy Sperber, devoted grandfather of Matthew, Jonathan, Suzanne and Noah, and dear friend of his first wife, Bunnie Schwartz Moses. His humor, insight, kind heart and gentle ways will be sorely missed and remembered always by all who knew him. Graveside service Friday, March 29 11am, Mt. Pleasant Cemetery, Hawthorne, NY.
