        STROM-Ronald. Died in his sleep Jan. 25 in Rome, where he was buried in the Protestant Cemetery. A translator, interpretor, editor, teacher, writer & brilliant literary colleague. Longtime resident in Italy, Ron will be greatly missed by a large circle of friends on both sides of the Atlantic. He was a prodigious reader with wide ranging interests. We, who treasure him, will fondly remember many stimulating conversations around many delightful dinnertables. Ti Riccordiamo Sempre.
