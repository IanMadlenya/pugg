        HESCHEL--Sylvia. The Abraham Joshua Heschel School community mourns the passing of our esteemed Honorary President, Sylvia Heschel. Mrs. Heschel was deeply connected to and involved with us from our inception beginning with giving us permission to use her beloved husband's name for the school. Over the years, she was a constant guest at our Benefit dinners and, on occasion, we delighted in hearing her play the piano. She took great pleasure in seeing the school grow and enjoyed the visits of our students over the last year when she was ill. We extended our sincerest sympathy to her daughter, Dr. Susannah Heschel, and the entire family. May you be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Alisa R. Doctoroff, President Roanna Shorofsky, Head of School Peter Geffen, Founder
        HESCHEL--Sylvia. The Jewish Theological Seminary mourns the passing of Sylvia Heschel, nee Strauss, wife of Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, Professor of Jewish Ethics and Mysticism at JTS and one of the most significant theologians of the twentieth century. Sylvia's compassion, intellect, and musical talents will be sorely missed. She was her husband's close companion, friend, and much-beloved muse, supporting him as he produced his prolific and influential writings. The generosity and hospitality she displayed to JTS students and faculty over the years will long be remembered. May her daughter, Susannah, and the rest of the Heschel family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Arnold Eisen, Chancellor-elect Gershon Kekst, Board Chairman
