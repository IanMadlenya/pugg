        FLEMING-Robert B.., Sr. The Pace University community mourns the passing of Robert B. Fleming Sr., founding dean of its School of Law, who passed away on December 16. Fleming served as dean from 1976 to 1982. He then joined the Pace Law School faculty prior to returning to Buffalo in 1987, where he served in private practice through most of this year. The public service ethic that he brought to campus is thriving 23 years later. Our condolences are extended to his wife, Jeanne; his sister, Scottie Walton, and brother, David Fleming; sons Robert Jr., Mick & Andrew; daughters Molly, Kate (Cohen) and Jane (Fottrell); and 14 grandchildren. Aniello A. Bianco, Chairman Board of Trustees Patricia O. Ewers, President David Cohen, Dean, School of Law
