        SHERMAN-Donald. Age 62. Peacefully passed away on March 3 with his family by his side at his home in North Miami Beach, Florida. For 44 years, he was the beloved husband of Marcia (nee Spirer) of Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. Loving father of Debra and Filip Tiffenberg and Ronald and Barbara Sherman of Tenafly, New Jersey. Cherished grandfather of Erica and Danielle Sherman and Jodi and Michelle Tiffenberg. Devoted son of Rhoda and the late Michael Sherman of Hackensack, New Jersey. He is sadly missed by his dear brother, Marshall, sistersin-law, Rosemary Sherman and Eva Mullane, and brother-in-law, Lawrence Mullane. After graduating from Lincoln High School in Jersey City, he married his childhood sweetheart and went to work in the family business, the Sherman Paint Store in Jersey City. By the age of 21, he had become a successful real estate developer. In the 1970's, he became involved in the taxicab industry in New York City. During the next twenty years, he built Midtown Operating Corp. into the largest taxi fleet in New York City. For many years, he was a member of the executive board of the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade. He also served on the Board of Directors of the Fort Lee Community Center. He was a generous supporter of numerous charitable and civic organizations but his philanthropic contributions were almost always made anonymously. Because he understood what was truly important in life, he retired ten years ago to devote himself to his family. He gave his love, support, counsel, and assistance to his family, his friends, his colleagues, his employees or anyone who sought it. His concern for others remained undiminished even during his quiet and courageous battle against cancer. His generosity of spirit will be his legacy to all who knew him. Memorial contributions may be made to: Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, NY, NY 10021.
