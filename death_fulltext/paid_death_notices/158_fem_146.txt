        SACKLER-Else. The Board of Directors, Officers and Staff of the Arthur M. Sackler Foundation mourn the loss of our Senior Director and major benefactor, Else Sackler. Her intuitive understanding of the art in the collections and her artistic sensibility were essential to the exhibiting and publishing activities of the Foundation. Her guidance over the many years and her active participation and interest in all the various projects undertaken by the Foundation will be sorely missed.
