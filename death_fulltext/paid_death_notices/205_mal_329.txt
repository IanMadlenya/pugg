        GOLDBERG--Bernard. The Board of Directors, residents and staff of The Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale mourn with profound sadness the loss of our beloved Chairman and friend. For over twenty years, Bernie provided vision and leadership to the Hebrew Home. His support of the new initiatives of the Home, and his unwavering dedication to the residents and staff were a source of inspiration. More than a Board member, Bernie was an integral part of the Hebrew Home family. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Bernie's beloved wife Carole, loving sons Avery (Leila), Stewart (Gladys), sister Dotty Raines, and grandson Jonathan (Debbie). May Bernie's soul be bound among the mourners of Zion. Milton Gilbert, President Daniel Reingold, Executive Vice President
