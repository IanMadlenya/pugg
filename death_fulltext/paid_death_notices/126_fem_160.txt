        SALKIND-Clare. Of New York and Delray Beach. Our beloved Aunt Clare will be sorely missed by her legion of friends as well as her nieces, nephews, grandnieces, grandnephews and many cousins who cherished her. All recognized her as a lady of indomitable spirit, warmth and love. Our tears are mitigated by remembrance of a life well spent. We will miss her always. Contributions to memorialize her to: Jewish National Fund (Trees), 212-751-4848.
