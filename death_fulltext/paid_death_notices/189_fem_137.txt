        KEISER - Elissa. Beloved mother of David, wife of Richard, and sister of Carmela, Helen, Anne, Ella, and Leonora, passed away Wednesday night, after a two year struggle with cancer. A former teacher and school business administrator, she will be remembered as a kind, compassionate, and generous woman, and as a conscientious and accomplished professional. Her personal commitments to education and social justice never waivered. She will be loved and missed forever by those whose lives she touched.
