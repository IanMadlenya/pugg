        WEINBERG--Edward. It is with profound sorrow that we mourn the passing of Edward Weinberg, who had a long and distinguished history of service to the American Jewish community, and especially to the HIAS, Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, for which he served on the Board of Directors from 1963 to 1998. In 1984 he became a vice president of the board, and in 1998 he was made an Honorary Director for Life. Edward's selfless and hard work on behalf of refugees, asylumseekers, and other immigrants in need marked him as a true humanitarian of a global scope. Our sincere condolences go to his wife, Adele, and children, Joel, Deborah, Elisa Owen, Clifford Trolin, Martha Trolin, and grandchildren. Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society Jerome Teller, Chair. Gideon Aronoff, President and CEO.
