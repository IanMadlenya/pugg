        WEAVER-Robert C. Ph.D. The Trustees, Faculty and Staff of The Mount Sinai Medical Center mourn the passing of the Honorable Robert C. Weaver Ph.D., who served as our Trustee for more than 28 years. A dedicated public servant who was Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Lyndon Johnson, and a champion of social justice, Dr. Weaver was an esteemed member of our Boards, as well as a supporter of Mount Sinai's mission of excellence in patient care, medical education and scientific research. He was a cherished friend who will be profoundly missed. We extend our sincere condolences to his family. Stephen M. Peck, Chairman John W. Rowe, M.D., President Nathan G. Kase, MD, Dean Barry R.
