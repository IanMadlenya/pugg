        RAPHAEL-Richard. The Board of Directors and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Richard Raphael, whose business achievements in the construction industry were only equaled by his commitment to the Jewish community. A selfmade man & a longtime supporter of communal causes, he gave freely of his time and talent to those who needed his help. Those who met him were touched by his love, compassion, and generosity. To his wife, Beverly; their daughters, Robyn & Lindsay; his father, Max; his brother, Barry; his devoted first cousin, Jerry Levin, and his caring wife, Carol; and the entire family, we extend our deepest sympathies. May you be consoled among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair James S. Tisch, President Klara Silverstein, General Co-Chair 1999 Annual Campaign Stephen D. Solender, Exec. VP Paul Kane, Senior VP Annual Campaign
