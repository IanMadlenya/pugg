        KING--Susan Bennett. National Public Radio mourns the death but celebrates the life of Susan Bennett King, a Charter Trustee of NPR Foundation, founded in 1993. Through her long career in the public and non-profit sectors, Susan's was a life of passionate service. As Vice Chair of The NPR Foundation, Susan helped lead public radio advocates in building the NPR Endowment Fund for Excellence, which will benefit NPR in perpetuity. In recognition of her leadership, the boardroom at NPR headquarters in Washington, DC, was named in her honor last November. The NPR Foundation is honored to accept gifts in her memory. Our hearts go out to her husband, Steve Glantz, and her entire family, of which NPR was a proud member. Kevin Klose, CEO, NPR John A.
