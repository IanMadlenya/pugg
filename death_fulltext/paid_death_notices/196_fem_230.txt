        NELKIN -- Dorothy. The trustees, faculty, staff, alumni and students of New York University School of Law are saddened by the loss of Professor Dorothy Nelkin. Professor Nelkin served NYU since 1988, both in the law school and in the Dept of Sociology. On behalf of the many law students she taught, we extend our heartfelt sympathy to Dorothy's husband, Mark Nelkin, daughter, Lisa Nelkin, granddaughter, Erica Peckens, and her entire family. She will be greatly missed by all who knew her. Lester Pollack, Chairman, NYU School of Law Foundation Richard Revesz, Dean, NYU School of Law >>AD#
