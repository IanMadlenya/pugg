        SILVAN--Matthew. The members of The New York Psychoanalytic Society & Institute mourn the untimely loss of our esteemed colleague, Dr. Matthew Silvan. His demise is a tragedy for his family and a great loss to his friends, his patients and to our Institute. As one of our younger colleagues, he represented our future hopes. Matthew was a skilled clinician of great promise, an enthusiastic and devoted teacher, and among the most talented of our recent graduates. We will feel his absence deeply and will miss his intelligence, his fervor and his commitment to psychoanalysis. We send our deepest condolences to his family and friends. Paul Rosenbaum, M.D., Pres Philip Herschenfeld, M.D., Dean
