        BJORNSON-Maria. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the untimely death of Maria Bjornson, who designed the sets for our new production of Berlioz's ''Les Troyens,'' which premiers in February. A remarkably talented and creative designer, Maria was also a dedicated professional who had become a deeply respected colleague and good friend to all those who had the privilege to work with her. We extend our condolences to her family and friends. Joseph Volpe, General Manager James Levine, Artistic Director
