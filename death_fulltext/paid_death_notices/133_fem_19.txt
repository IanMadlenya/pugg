        HIRSHON-Dorothy. The Board of Trustees mourns the loss of Dorothy Hirshon, Trustee of Carnegie Hall from 1963 to 1987, an Honorary Trustee from 1987 until her sudden death this past weekend. Throughout her 35 years of devotion to Carnegie Hall, she helped save this landmark building from the ravages of time and revitalized it for future generations of music lovers. We extend our sympathy to her entire family in this time of loss, and celebrate her extraordinary life and legacy. Isaac Stern, President Sanford I. Weill, Chairman Judith Arron, Executive Director
