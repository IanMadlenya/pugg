        DUNHAM-William B. Chamber Music America will miss the wit and wisdom of Bill Dunham, the first person to serve as Vice Chairman of CMA, the first non-musician member of the Board, and author of the organization's first history. Bill's involvement with our organization during its formative years was instrumental in shaping CMA's growth and early success. His unswerving loyalty, wise counsel, and generous spirit inspired us all. To his wife and children, we offer heartfelt condolences.
