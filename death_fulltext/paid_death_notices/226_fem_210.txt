        WILSON -- Katherine Stern. The Board of Trustees, Medical Staff and Administration of Hospital for Special Surgery mourn with profound sorrow the death of Katherine (Kit) Wilson. She captured the essence of elegance and was a pillar of support for the Hospital. She exemplified the tradition of leadership among her peers which has long been a hallmark of the relationship of the Wilson family to HSS. She will be greatly missed. To her husband, Dr. Philip D. Wilson, Jr. our Surgeon-in-Chief Emeritus, and her entire family, we express our profound sympathy. Dr. Wilson has requested donations in Mrs. Wilson's honor be made to the Nursing, Research and Education Program at Hospital for Special Surgery.
