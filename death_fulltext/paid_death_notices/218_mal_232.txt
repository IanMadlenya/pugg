        RIZACK--Martin A. MD. Ph.D. The Medical Letter mourns the loss of Martin Rizack on March 7, 2005. Martin, who was a distinguished researcher at Rockefeller University, was an integral part of our publication, beginning in 1966 as a member of our editorial board. One of the first people in medicine to understand the importance of drug interactions, he was the author of ''The Medical Letter Handbook of Adverse Drug Interactions'', the first book on the subject to be widely read by physicians. His clear vision of new drugs and the place they would achieve in practice were invaluable to The Medical Letter and an inestimable service to the medical community.
