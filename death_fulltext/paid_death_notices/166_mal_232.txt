        PAM-Simon. 90, of Deerfield Beach, FL. Husband of the late Berta Pam; father of Alvin, Eleanor (Juceam), Jeffrey, and Robert and their spouses, 13 grandchildren, two great-grandchildren. Survived also by brothers Rabbi Abraham Pam and Charles Pam. A disciplined intellectual man of quality, generosity, modesty, dignity, and conscience, he was adored, admired, and will be missed by his large family. He was a chess champion and philosophy student with working class roots. Until the end of his life he remained engaged in the world, the life of the mind, and political discourse, exercising daily and diligently at the gym, reading voraciously, and being fully independent, functional, and self-sustaining. Forever, and passionately, he remained the champion of the underdog. He was a great and special man.
