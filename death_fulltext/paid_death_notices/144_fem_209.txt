        KESTENBERG-Judith, M.D. NYU Psychoanalytic Institute mourns the loss of our esteemed and beloved colleague, Judith Kestenberg, M.D. As a Training and Supervising Analyst, she contributed so much to our institute, to her students, and to her patients. Her work with those affected by the Holocaust, both children and adults, is well-known, and has been of tremendous value for all of humanity. We are saddened by her loss.
