        ELBAUM--Izak. The Heschel School community mourns the loss of Izak Elbaum beloved father of Trudy Elbaum Gottesman and fatherin-law of Bob Gottesman. Izak was the deeply cherished grandfather of Heschel students Sarah and Ben. He was a noble survivor of the Shoah, a learned person, who was able to build a life for himself and his family through great courage and tenacity. That Trudy has been instrumental in the development of our Holocaust Commemoration Commit tee, our Holocaust archives as well as a leader in so many aspects of our new high school, is a real tribute to her father. Our heartfelt sympathies to Steve, Danny and the entire Elbaum family. May you be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Alisa R. Doctoroff, President Roanna Shorofsky, Head of School
