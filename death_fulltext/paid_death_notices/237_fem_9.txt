        TIEFER--Rosalind Crost, 92, Meadowview, Mt. Vernon, NY, died September 28, 2006. Born to Brooklyn Jews of Dutch descent, graduated from Brooklyn College ('33), Juilliard, and Columbia Teachers' College. Rosalind won piano prizes and a Philharmonic scholarship, played in Simeon Bellison's Clarinet Ensemble and countless concerts, trained student bands, choruses and orchestras, directed musicals at summer camps, prepared young musicians for auditions, and taught both music and world history from 1938 to 1971 at Walton and Theodore Roosevelt High Schools. After ''retirement,'' Ros performed with the Bronx Opera, American Landmark Festivals, Hudson River Choral Society, and at Community Church of New York. After the death of her deeply loved husband Abraham David in 1981 she became an intrepid world traveller and active member of Westchester NOW and its book club. She directed Yonkers Temple Emanu-El Women's Chorus concerts at nursing homes for a decade. Ros leaves her grieving children, Leonore and Charles, daughter-in-law Hillary, and beloved grandsons Max and Roy. Her lifelong undimmable passions for great music, intellectual rigor, progressive politics, and family are her legacy. Memorial service to be announced.
