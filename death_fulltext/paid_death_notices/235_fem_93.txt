        HAYDEN--Melissa. We owe a debt of gratitude to the spirit, discipline, artistry and commitment of Millie. A convert and then a disciple of Mr. Balanchine, she endeavored to communicate a sense of artistic credibility to an art form that is often obscure. There was never an obstacle that she felt she could not overcome. Her courage with regard to art and its dissemination was and is, an inspiration. The memory of Millie will remain of pillar of inspiration to the art of all dance. The George Balanchine Trust Karin von Aroldingen Kay Mazzo Bellas Paul H.

        $(6$)HAYDEN--Melissa. You were an inspiration, a teacher and my friend. I was a voyeur to your love of ''performing,'' and I learned from you a respect for the energy spent on the stage and its relation to the public. You were a textbook of lessons to the novice. I will never forget you, and value your care and loyalty to me. Barbara Horgan
        $(6$)HAYDEN--Melissa. We miss you profoundly and, in our grief, are reminded of Martha Graham's telegram, sent to you on your 1973 City Ballet retirement, which said, ''The world will endeavor to woo you back.'' Would that we could do so now! Memorial gifts may be made to the Melissa Hayden Scholarship at the School of American Ballet, 70 Lincoln Center Plaza, New York, NY 10023, c/o Marjorie Van Dercook. With love, from her children Jennifer & Stuart their spouses Burt & Alice and her grandchildren Emma, Teddy, Libby, Abigail and Phoebe
