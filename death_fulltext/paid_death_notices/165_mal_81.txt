        RABER-Irving. The Trustees and staff of the Educational Alliance note with profound sadness the passing of Irving Raber, our devoted Trustee and friend. Irving joined the Board in November, 1988 and remained active until his death. He was involved with house and building issues and was a supporter and advocate of our agency's programs. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, son, daughter and their families.
