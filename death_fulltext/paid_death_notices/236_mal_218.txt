        ROSENBERG--Michael J. The NYU community mourns the loss of its devoted alumnus and trustee, Michael Rosenberg. A recipient of an MBA from NYU's Leonard N. Stern School of Business, he had a distinguished business career, and was decorated for valor for his military service in Korea. He served NYU with devotion; he was twice elected President of the NYU Club, was a recipient of the NYU Alumni Association Meritorious Service Award, was chair of the Stern Fund Steering Committee, was immediate past president of the NYU Alumni Association, and was elected a Trustee Associate in 1997. He was a warm and caring man, and his generosity to NYU and other institutions with his time, his energy, and his wisdom exemplified the finest traditions of the University and speaks volumes about his character. On behalf of the NYU community, we extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Kathleen, his daughters Emily Roth and Ann Rosenberg, and all his loved ones. His absence will be keenly felt by us all. Martin Lipton, Chair, NYU Board of Trustees John Sexton, President, NYU
