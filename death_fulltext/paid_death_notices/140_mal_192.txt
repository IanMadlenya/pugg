        KLEIN-Stanley. We mourn the tragic loss on the Swissair 111 of our devoted friend, officer and supporter. A man of deep faith, his devotion to his people was legendary, yet he embraced all people who were in need. His deeds of humanity, charity and kindness will live on for posterity. Our heartfelt sympathy to his wife Carol, his sons Abraham and Alan and the entire family. Wall Street Synagogue Rabbi Meyer Hager
        KLEIN-Stanley. You were a good friend to us and our family. We loved you and will miss you so much. Isabel and Stu
