        GOLD-Ray (Katz). Of Fair Lawn, NJ, on September 5, 2002. Beloved wife of the late Max ''Larry'', cherished mother of Ava (Roger) Brown, Marion and Stanley, and loving grandmother of Taylor and Scott Brown. Her laughter and great strength live on in those she loved-and she lives on with her ''Larry'' for eternity. We know they will take care of each other. Love, Marion and Jerry
