        LICHTERMAN--Dr. Sigmund, 96, of Coconut Creek, FL on September 10th. Formerly of Irvington, NY, he practiced dentistry in the Bronx until his retirement to Florida, where he devoted himself to his true passion, sculpture. His work has been shown in many galleries and museums. Boyish and optimistic, he derived great pleasure from life. Predeceased by his wife of 65 years, Betty, he is survived by his older brother Dr. Jacob Lichterman, many loving nieces, nephews, their children and their grandchildren. Contributions may be made to the Humane Society of the United States.
