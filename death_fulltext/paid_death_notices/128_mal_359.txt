        RAVIN-Allen. The Ford Dealers Alliance would like to express our deepest sympathy to the family of Allen Ravin. Allen had been legal counsel to the Alliance since its inception in 1969 and had worked relentlessly with dealers toward ending factory injustices beginning in 1967. His dedication to the cause was genuine, his fairness, unparalleled. He was a true advocate of dealer rights with a no-nonsense approach to the law. He did not ''suffer fools gladly.'' He was a true friend in battle, like Don Quixote, we fought the windmills. Win or lose, he never lost passion in the challenge. Allen, you were a true and loyal friend. We will miss you and we are proud to have known you. Goodbye, old friend. Ed Mullane, Ford Dealers Alliance
