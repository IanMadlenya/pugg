        SCHMELTZ-Rabbi Benjamin. Israel has lost a Torah Crown. Friends and members of the Murray Hill Synagogue have suffered a wound to all our hearts. We have lost our beloved Rabbi. More than a friend, he was like a brother, a son, or a favorite uncle to all of us. The Jewish people have lost one of its potentially greatest leaders. Our deepest sympathies are extended to his entire family. May we all be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. The Murray Hill Synagogue
