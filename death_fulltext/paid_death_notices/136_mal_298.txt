        TAYLOR-Telford. The Board of Directors, faculty, students and staff of Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law of Yeshiva University deeply mourn the death of our colleague, mentor and model. A member of the original Cardozo faculty, Professor Taylor helped found and guide the law school, providing his ideals and gifts to a then-young institution. Fiercely committed to international human rights and accountability for war crimes, renowned for his role at Nuremberg, and beloved as a teacher, Professor Taylor instilled generations of law students at Cardozo, Yale, and Columbia with his zeal for constitutionalism. The Telford Taylor Fellowships in Public International Law and the Telford Taylor Award at Cardozo have been established first in his honor and now in his memory. We extend our condolences to Professor Taylor's wife, Professor Toby Golick, director of Cardozo's Bet Tzedek Legal Services Clinic, and the entire family. Earle I. Mack, Chairman Cardozo Board of Directors Paul R. Verkuil, Dean
