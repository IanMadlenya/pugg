        REINIS-Lili H. The Jewish Theological Seminary family records with sorrow the death of Lili H. Reinis, beloved mother of longtime board member, former treasurer and Louis Marshall Award recipient, Stephen M. Axinn. Mrs. Reinis finished first in her class at NYU Law School, established a thriving legal practice and instilled in her family a love of Jewish learning. Her granddaughter, Audrey Axinn, is a faculty member of JTS's Miller Cantorial School. She is survived by sons, Stephen and Daniel Axinn, six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. May her memory be for a blessing. Ismar Schorsch, chancellor Gershon Kekst, board chairman
