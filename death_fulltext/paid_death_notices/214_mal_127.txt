        MATHEWS--Walter. On November 10, 2004. Walter was born in San Francisco on October 19, 1922. For five years he served proudly as a Navy officer during WWII. Working for American Airlines, he moved to NYC in 1955. In the 60s he created and edited for many years ''Briefing'', a restaurant newsletter for American Express. For the past 23 years he has lived in Stuyvesant, NY where he most recently and with great enthusiasm developed a program to provide memorial trees for the newly built town hall. He also enjoyed spending time at Mandorlo, his beloved farmhouse in Tuscany. He will be missed by many friends and neighbors including Larry Ashmead, his loving partner for 43 years. At his request there will be no funeral or memorial service. Contributions may be made to Trees Are Our Town's Treasure, c/o Ellen McClelland Lesser, Box 151, Stuyvesant, NY 12173.
