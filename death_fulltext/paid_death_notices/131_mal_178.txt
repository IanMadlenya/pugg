        CHASSLER-Sey. The staff of Parade Publications, where he was a consulting editor to PARADE Magazine, mourns the untimely loss of a beloved friend and colleague. Sey was a dear and cherished member of our family, many of whom had also benefited from his wise counsel and guidance during the nearly twenty years that he was editor of Redbook. We will miss his sense of humor, keen intellect and deep sense of commitment and compassion. We extend our deepest sympathies to his loving wife, Natalie, his children, Joseph, Philip, and Deborah and his grandchildren, Nora, Zachariah, Benjamin, Daniel and Hannah.
