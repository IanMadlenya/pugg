        SIEFF-Lord Marcus Joseph. The American Committee for the Weizmann Institute of Science mourns the passing of Lord Marcus Joseph Sieff, Chancellor and Chairman Emeritus of the Weizmann Institute of Science Board of Governors. Throughout his life, Lord Sieff was deeply involved in Weizmann, promoting its mission of science research for the benefit of humanity. The Daniel Sieff Research Institute was established in Israel in 1934 by the Seiff family in memory of Lord Marcus's younger brother. The Sieff Institute grew into the Weizmann Institute. A constant source of inspiration, Lord Sieff believed passionately in strengthening Israel through science, technology and economic growth. He was a tireless philanthrophic leader, whose efforts touched the lives of countless individuals. We express our deepest sympathy to the Sieff family. Robert H.
