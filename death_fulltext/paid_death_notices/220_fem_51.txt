        MARTIN -- Natalie ''Mimi''. Passed away on April 25, 2005 from heart failure in Rancho Mirage, CA. She was 74. Born Natalie Powell Scott in Cedarhurst, NY, she graduated from the Oldfields School in Glencoe, MD, in 1949. She moved to New York City in the 1950's and worked for Jonai, a women's apparel retailer, and then for Saks Fifth Avenue as an assistant buyer. Natalie married Francis Martin, Jr., an advertising executive, in 1964 and they lived in Manhattan for 20 years. After Francis retired, they relocated to Reno, NV, and spent the winters in La Quinta, CA. She was an avid golfer, played bridge and backgammon, participated in community affairs and enjoyed traveling throughout the world. From 1979 to '86 and again in '88, Natalie kept official score cards for amateur, celebrity and professional golfers during the Bob Hope Desert Classic (now called the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic), a stop on the PGA tour. Rebounding from health problems in the early 1990's, Natalie won several tournaments and was named the Most Improved Golfer of 1996 by the La Quinta Country Club. She volunteered her time to several nonprofit associations, including the Braille Institute Associates of the Desert, Palm Springs Pathfinders and the Valley Partners with California State University. Known for her magnetic personality, endless energy, charm and quick wit, Natalie's network of friends was no less than amazing. Francis preceded Natalie in December 2003. She is survived by a son Scott Marshutz of Laguna Niguel, CA; stepdaughter Anne Rossman of Menlo Park, CA; stepson Francis III; and two step granddaughters, Eleanor and Grace, of Portland, OR. Friends are invited to attend a Celebration of Life reception on Thursday, June 9, 2005, from 4-6 pm at the Union Club, 101 East 69th St, NY, NY. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the American Heart Association, 122 East 42nd St, NYC, 10168.
