        TOGASHI-Tom. Pioneering Japanese TV journalist, loved and admired by colleagues, friends and family, died at home in New York City on June 4, 2000, of lung cancer at age 63. A fisherman's son from Northern Japan, he earned a law degree from Chuo University in Tokyo and was awarded a law scholarship from the University of Kansas in Lawrence in 1959. At a time when young Japanese rarely left their homeland, he explored every part of the country he loved and eventually became an American citizen. During the turbulent 60's he took part in almost every major event, became a wellknown figure in the East Village, working with LaMama and other groups. He then went on to make award-winning documentaries for Japanese and American public television. His passionate interest in astronomy was reflected in an impressive International NHK-TV Galactic Odyssey series. In 1996 he received a Media Achievement Award from the International Society for the Study of Dissociation for his sensitive TV portrayal of multiple personality disorder. His beaming smile and integrity won the hearts of all who loved and worked with him-whose personal and professional lives he so deeply touched. He will be remembered for his compassion... his playful wit and intellectual curiosity...for his loyalty, tolerance of others, and unwavering decency...and for the courage with which he faced his final challenge. His life was shorter than it might have been, but as rich and full as it could have been. He is survived by his wife, Bess Heitner; his brother, Hitoshi, in New York City; and his mother, Kikumi and family in Japan.
