        BROWN--Fred, Ph.D. The Mount Sinai Medical Center and its Board of Trustees mourn the passing of of Fred Brown, Ph.D., Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry, at the age 0f 100. Dr. Brown was selected as the first full time psychologist and Director of Psychology at The Mount Sinai Hospital in 1947, a position that he held for 28 years. In 1975, Dr. Brown was named Professor Emeritus at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. He was much loved and admired by his colleagues, not only for his brilliance as a clinical psychologist, but also for his quick wit, willingness to share his gifts, and dedication to his family. During W.W. II, Dr. Brown served in the U.S. Air Force and was discharged in 1946 with the rank of Major. After his retirement from Mount Sinai, Dr. Brown remained in private practice until the age of 91, making a specialty of forensic psychology and testifying in many high profile cases. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Dr. Brown's wife, Minerva (Mickey) Brown, who is the former Administrator for Mount Sinai's Post Graduate School, and their two children, Janet and Daniel. Peter W. May, Chairman of the Board of Trustees Kenneth L. Davis, M.D., President, CEO and Dean Dennis S. Charney, Dean of Research
