        BALAKIAN-Anna. The Department of Comparative Literature and the Department of French, as well as the entire Faculty of Arts and Science of New York University, are deeply saddened by the loss of our dear colleague, Professor Emerita Anna Balakian. She left an indelible mark on us, on our students, and on the profession she served so brilliantly for so many years. Our heartfelt sympathy goes to Suzanne and Haig Naldantian, David and Aline Reynolds.
