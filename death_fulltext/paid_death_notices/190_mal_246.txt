        TEMPLE-Maurice. Age 67. Died November 19, 2002 of pancreatic cancer. Much adored husband to Janice. Cherished father to Richard and Ellen. Loved and respected father-in-law to Nancy and Barry. Beloved grandfather to Zoe and Jim. Friend and confidante to countless others. A graduate of Pace University, he loved reading, classical music, current events, his spectacular 40year career at Purdue Pharma (which culminated in his appointment to vice presidency), his devotion to Common Cause where he served as New York State Treasurer, his many friends and relatives, delightfully foolish word play, and, above all, his wife Jan, to whom he was married for 44 glorious years. He retired from Purdue Pharma (to much fanfare) in 2000 and enjoyed two years of blissful retirement before becoming ill. He was an absolute joy to all who knew himup to the very gracious, noble and lucid end-and we all miss him very much already. Services will be held Thursday, 1:30PM at ''Sinai Chapels'', 162-05 Horace Harding Expressway, Fresh Meadows. No flowers please. Contributions may be made to the charity of your choice.
