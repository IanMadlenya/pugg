        TARAS--John. Peter Martins, the Board of Directors, the dancers and staff of New York City Ballet mourn the passing of John Taras. John's long association with George Balanchine began as a student at the School of American Ballet, continued as a dancer with several of Mr. Balanchine's early companies and culminated in his position as Ballet Master for New York City Ballet, a title he shared with Mr. Balanchine and Jerome Robbins. Mr. Balanchine also encouraged John to choreograph and during his years with the company he created more than 15 works. A man of grace, sophistication and impeccable style, John will be greatly missed by the entire ballet world. We extend our sincerest condolences to his wife Helene Sadovska and stepdaughter Anne Stephant.
