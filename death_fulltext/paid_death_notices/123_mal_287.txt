        GITENSTEIN-Aaron. We mourn the loss of a devoted and dear friend of the ''Hospital With a Heart'' who will forever be remembered with great affection. As a Golden Founder of the hospital & a benefactor of the Jesselson Heart Center and Woman and Infant Center, his generosity and kindness has helped the mission of Shaare Zedek Medical Center to heal the sick and ease the pain of the afflicted. May his sister Shirley be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. American Committee for Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem Charles H.
