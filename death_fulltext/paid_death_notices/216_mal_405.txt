        WAXMAN -- Isidore Harold, devoted husband, father and grandfather, died just before Shabbat on Friday, January 21, 2005. Born in 1916, Mr. Waxman was a graduate of Townsend Harris High School and the City College of New York. Mr. Waxman was in many ways the embodiment of the Greatest Generation; the record of his life is a testament to the courage and perseverance for which that generation has come to be known. For 22 years he served with honor and bravery in the New York City Fire Department - retiring as a battalion chief in 1961 - purposefully choosing to work in the city's most impoverished neighborhoods. Mr. Waxman went on to a successful and challenging career with Rose Associates, the developers. He retired in 1981 as a senior executive. An avid fisherman and photographer, Mr. Waxman spent his retirement traveling Europe and Asia with his devoted wife of 64 years, Anne. To those whose lives he touched, he will be remembered as a man of deep faith, an unabating love for his family, and, above all, an unceasing intellectual curiosity that lasted into his final hours. He is survived by his wife, his son Mark, daughter Geraldine, daughter - in - law Marilyn, and grandson Samuel.
