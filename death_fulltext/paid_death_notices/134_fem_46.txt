        NEWMAN-Lili. A woman with a love of life, people, and a spirit of adventure who gave that gift to all who knew her. Her courage, wisdom, honesty, strength and generosity survived through those who loved her. She died peacfully on March 6, 1998 and will be mourned by many: her husband Abraham, her daughters Vicki and Jessica, her sons-in-law Walter and Roger, her granddaughters and grandson-in-law Karen, Scott, Catherine, Amy and Rebecca, her greatgranddaughter Julie and her friends Lee, Ruthie, Jason, Eva and Grace. She touched many lives through her work at United Service for New Americans and there are some who live in freedom because of her individual efforts. In her way, she made the world a smaller place and she will be missed by her family and friends in Sweden, Hungary and Israel who enriched her life and whose lives were enriched by her. Services Sunday, March 8 at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 W. 76th Street at Amsterdam Ave.
