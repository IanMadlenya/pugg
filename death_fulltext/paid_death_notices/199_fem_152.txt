        McCRARY--Jinx Falkenburg. The North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System mourns the passing and celebrates the extraordinary life of Jinx Falkenburg McCrary. Mrs. McCrary and her late husband John ''Tex'' McCrary were among the founders of North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, NY. Both were ardent supporters and long-time trustees of the institution. Mrs. McCrary was a tennis star in California when she was discovered by film producer Sam Goldwyn. The first ''Miss Rheingold,'' Mrs. McCrary appeared on Broadway and in films until her marriage to Mr. McCrary brought her to Manhasset, NY. Beginning with ''Hi, Jinx,'' the couple launched a series of successful radio and television programs and became known as ''Mr. and Mrs. New York.'' Over a period of 12 years, through her radio and television programs, she helped to raise $12 million to build, support and expand North Shore University Hospital. The North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System is eternally grateful for the commitment and spirit of this wonderful woman. We extend our condolences to her sons Michael, Kevin and John. Roy J. Zuckerberg, Chairman Michael J. Dowling, President and CEO North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System
