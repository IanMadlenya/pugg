        KELMAN-Norman, M.D. You will always be a paradigm in the pursuit of knowledge; in respect for the dream; in reverence for music, art, literature, philosphy and on the impact you have had on the many you have influenced. You were my supervisor and my friend. ''This is thy hour O Soul, thy free flight into the wordless, Away from books, away from art, the day erased, the lesson done. Thee fully forth emerging, silent, gazing pondering the themes thou lovest best, Night, sleep, death and stars.'' (Whitman) Robert Schwalbe, CSW
        KELMAN-Norman, Dr. The Candidates Assocation of the American Institute for Psychoanalysis deeply mourns the passing of our teacher and mentor, Dr. Norman Kelman. We will miss his wisdom, creative thinking, and unfailing spirit of intellectual curiosity.
