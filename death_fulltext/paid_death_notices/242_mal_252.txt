        POEPPLEIN--Ronald F. Beloved friend and colleague. Ron graduated Brooklyn Law School in 1978 and immediately became a student of the law, an outstanding trial attorney, an accomplished legal writer and appellate attorney. He was a fellow of The American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, one of the youngest ever elected, and had been president of the Criminal Courts Bar Association of Nassau County. He was also a member of the American, New York State and Nassau County Bar Associations. He was included in Who's Who in American Law. In 1996 he co-authored the second edition of a two-volume work on separation agreements and marital contracts. For many years he shared his legal wisdom as an adjunct professor at Adelphi University where he taught matrimonial law in the Lawyers Assistant Program. His reputation for skillfully litigating complex cases was well known in the legal community. There was never a task too big for Ron. It was a privilege for all of us to work with Ron. Our hearts go out to his loving wife Lorraine, and his family. The wake will be held at the Cassidy Funeral home, 156 Willis Avenue, Mineola, New York, on Sunday, March 25, 2007, from 2-5 pm and 7-9 pm. A mass will be held on Monday, March 26, 2007, at the Corpus Christi RC Church, 155 Garfield Avenue, Mineola, New York (off Willis Avenue) at 9:30 am. All of Rons friends and colleagues at Schlissel, Ostrow, Karabatos & Poepplein will miss him dearly.
