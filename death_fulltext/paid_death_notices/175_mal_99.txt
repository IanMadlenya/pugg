        CHAMLIN-George M. Of Deal, New Jersey, died on July 10, 2001. We buried dear George on July 12, 2001-his body, but not his spirit. The man we all respected and loved. The man with a spark whose beautiful brown eyes reflected a light that guided us. The man whose resonant voice called to us, sang to us and spoke to us in the most encouraging, reassuring and caring way. The man whose strong, yet slender fingers touched us and caressed us. The man whose big and generous heart enveloped us with an unshakeable love. The man whose solid and supportive frame provided us with a base upon which to lean and rest. A trial attorney who had a deep and abiding belief in our Judicial system which enabled him to practice law in a highly principled manner. His diligence and resourcefulness, his compassionate nature and wit formed the foundation for his success and popularity. He was respected, not only as a trial litigator on behalf of his clients, but his principles garnered the respect and admiration of his adversaries and colleagues. Respecting and loving him was an honor, a gift, a joy. His loving wife, Isadora L. Chamlin
