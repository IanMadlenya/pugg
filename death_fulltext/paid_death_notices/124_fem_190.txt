        ARKIN-Rose G., daughter of Max & Fanny Garfunkel, passed away peacefully on Wednesday, May 28, 1997, at the Sarah Newman Home in Mamaroneck. Her age was 97 years young. Her outlook, her poetry, and her joy of life remain an inspiration to her children, grand & great-grandchildren and her friends. Rose graduated from Columbia Teacher's College in 1920 and this plus Brandeis U and Einstein Hospital remained vital interests to her. From her 1976 poetry book ''Journey To Awareness'': ... oh groping soul be brave for e'en the wish to save yourself is half the fight to win. And if we seek that peace, which brings us true release, remember, it must start within''. Services are private. Thoughts from Rosie's friends will be welcomed by Andrew and Amy Arkin, Judith Ritter, and Pat and Robert Gerdsen.
