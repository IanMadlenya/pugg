        FRIEDMAN-Clara. It has been one sad and lonely year since the death of my beloved Wife, who was a Mother, Grandmother and GreatGrandmother. She was a gentle and gallant lady who was admired and deeply loved by those lucky enough to have known her. She left us a legacy of love and a lifetime of treasured memories of her warmth and wisdom. She is deeply missed by us, and always will be. The Family
