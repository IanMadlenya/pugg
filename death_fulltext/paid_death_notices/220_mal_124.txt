        SMITH--Arthur F. The Board of Trustees and staff of The Children's Aid Society of New York are deeply saddened by the passing of our Trustee and friend. Discovered abandoned as an infant and put under the care of The Children's Aid Society at age five, Art was one of the original Orphan Train Riders and was adopted by an Iowa farm family. A longtime resident of New Jersey, Art served on the Board of The Orphan Train Heritage Society of America as well as on the Board of The Children's Aid Society. He was a generous donor to Children's Aid and always showed great concern for today's foster children. Edgar R. Koerner, Chairman Angela Diaz, M.D., M.P.H. President Philip Coltoff, CEO C. Warren Moses, Exec Dir The Children's Aid Society, New York
