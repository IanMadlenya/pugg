        SULLIVAN-William Mayo. The Board of Directors of the Metropolitan Opera Club notes with great sadness the death of William Mayo Sullivan, a former President and longtime member of the Club. He was a music lover who led the Club at the time of its transition from the ''Old House'' to its new home in Lincoln Center. His warmth and friendly presence will be sorely missed. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his wife, Francoise and to the other members of his family. Elizabeth L. Battle, President Peter J. Linden, Secretary
