        AVNER-Sylvia. The Board of Directors and Staff of the 92nd Street Y mourn the passing of Sylvia Avner, our beloved friend. She was Librarian at the 92nd Street Y for ten years, with a particular interest in children's library services. Since retiring in 1993, she has dedicated her energy to the entire institution, both as a volunteer for Y programs and special events, as well as a frequent audience member. Our hearts and prayers go out to Sylvia's son and daughter-inlaw, Phil and Elaine Avner; son Ken Avner; daughter and son-inlaw Annette and Richard Feldman, and five grandchildren. She will be greatly missed by all who were touched by her generous and caring spirit. Philip Milstein, President Joseph Leff, Chairman Sol Adler, Executive Director
