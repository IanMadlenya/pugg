        LEVITAS-Robert. Our beloved brother and uncle had so many outstanding qualities: an undying love for his family; an uncommon intelligence and drive (graduating first in his class from Fordham Law School and succeeding brilliantly as a lawyer and entrepreneur); and an exemplary character that shone throughout his long illness, transcending even his own extraordinary precedent by rising to inspiring heights of courage, dignity, and concern for his loved ones during his final days. We will love Robert always. Caryl, Gene, Gerson, Judy, Ethan, Andrea, Dana, and Uzi
        LEVITAS-Robert. My deepest sympathies to Leila, Andrew and Jessica for the loss of a loving husband and devoted father. He was a good friend and a gentle man. He will be missed by all who knew him. Costas Kondylis and Alexia Kondylis
