        FLEISCHER-Molly W., age 85, died peacefully on March 10, 1998 after a brief illness. Born in Hartford, CT, Mrs. Fleischer was the beloved mother of Robert S. Fleischer of NY and Susan Axelrod of Atlanta, special mother-in-law of Susan Raanan and Larry Axelrod, and deeply loved grandmother of David, Deborah, Matthew and Victoria. We will all cherish her memory. She is preceded in death by her loving husband, Harry. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests donations to Hadassah in NY, Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc., or the Southern Poverty Law Center, Birmingham, AL.
