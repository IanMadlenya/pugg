        FRIEDEN--Dr. Julian. The Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine of Montefiore Medical Center and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine is saddened to learn of the death of Dr. Julian Frieden. Dr. Frieden was a professor of clinical cardiology at the medical school and longtime associate of the Montefiore Medical Center. He established our first cardiac care unit as well as one of the first intermediate cardiac care units in the United States. He was an expert electrocardiographer who published numerous scientific publications on both electrocardiography as well as general cardiology. Dr. Frieden was the consummate cardiologist who inspired a generation of physicians to pursue careers in cardiology. We extend our sincere condolences to the entire Frieden family. Mark A.
