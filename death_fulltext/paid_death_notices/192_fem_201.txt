        MAUSS-Evelyn. Physicians for Social Responsibilty/NYC offers our deepest sympathy to the family of our long time Executive Committee member. Evelyn was a model, and inspiration, for all of us-always keeping the goal of justice and peace first, ever the optimist, always willing to be present. She will missed.
