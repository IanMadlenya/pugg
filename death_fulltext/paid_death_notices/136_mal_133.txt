        SELDEN-Dave. Dave Selden, who lead the American Federation of Teachers from 1968 through 1974, a period of rapid membership growth & collective bargaining successes for teachers, died late on Friday at Bronson Methodist Hospital in Kalamazoo, MI. of heart failure. His health had steadily deteriorated since suffering a stroke two years ago. Sandra Feldman, the current AFT President said, ''Dave Selden was a brilliant organizer and strategist. The teachers of America owe him a debt of gratitude for the major role he played in helping them achieve collective bargaining.''
        SELDEN-David. We mourn the passing of a great educator, brilliant labor strategist and pioneer in teacher unionism. As Director of Organization of the Teachers Guild from 1953, he was a main strategist in the creation of the United Federation of Teachers in 1960 and the winning of collective bargaining in 1961. He went on to become the president of the American Federation of Teachers, 1968-74, which grew into a major national union under his leadership. Our sincerest condolences to his wife Bernice and his family. Randi Weingarten, President United Federation of Teachers
