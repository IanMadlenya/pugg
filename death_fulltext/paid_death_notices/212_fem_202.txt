        BOOCOCK -- Glenn. The Board of Directors of The Metropolitan Opera Guild mourns the death of its beloved Board member, Glenn Winnett Boocock. Dougie, as she was affectionately known, joined our Board in 1948, and served with great distinction as a Vice President and on our Executive, Membership, Special Events and Nominating Committees, all of which she chaired at various times. She was passionately devoted to opera and to The Met, and in April 1987, was awarded The Guild's highest honor, our Eleanor Robson Belmont Medal. We will miss her candor, good humor and friendship, and extend our sympathies to her daughters, Susanna and Leslie. Winthrop Rutherfurd, Jr., Chairman Susan S. Braddock, Pres. David A. Dik, Managing Dir.
