        $(6$)BOEHM--Frances. The Board and Staff of the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) mourns the passing of one of its greatest and most devoted supporters, Fran Boehm. Fran was the wife, companion and lifelong partner of Robert Boehm, Chairman of the Board of Directors of CCR. She was a continuing source of support and ideas for CCR's programs over the years. In this capacity and in many others Fran actively participated in the broad sweeping political movements of the last century, as well as those of the first five years of the 21st-the civil rights movement in the South in the 1960's, the Vietnam anti-war movement of the 60's and 70's, the struggle against US intervention in Central America during the 1980's and the opposition to aggression, militarism and war from the 80's until today. Her wisdom, good cheer, unfailing support and transcendent spirit will be sadly missed.
