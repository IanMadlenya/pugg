        ROZETT-Cynthia. It is with great sorrow that the Board of Trustees, League, Administration and Staff of Parker Jewish Institute for Health Care and Rehabilitation mourn the passing of Cynthia Rozett, past President of Parker League & member of the Parker Board of Trustees. Cynthia was an exceptional leader and innovator whose tireless efforts and progressive vision helped build a dynamic volunteer force and support a myriad of health care programs that now serve thousands of older adults each year. A loving wife, mother and grandmother, Cynthia will be forever remembered for her kindness and generosity. Services May 1 at 11:30 AM, Schwartz Bros., 114-03 Queens Blvd, Forest Hills, NY. Barbara N.
