        SMITH--Paul Bennett. Cherished and beloved husband of Margie. Devoted and adored father of Robin, Brian and his fiancee Rachael Green. Son of the late Eve and Murray Smith. Brother of Carole and Howard Smith and Judy and Larry Greenberg. Loved like a son by Molly and the late Milton Greenberg. Caring uncle and wonderful friend to many. He was the best. Services Sunday, June 26, at 12 noon at Temple Beth El of Great Neck, 5 Old Mill Road, Great Neck, NY.
        SMITH--Paul Bennett. Paul's huge, great smile, his honesty, his warmth and caring, greeted everyone and anyone he ever met. But his frozen chocolate chips he shared only with a few zillions of us who were lucky enough to call him our friend. His love of family was boundless. His Big Red love of Cornell outdid all of us and made him our exuberant ''honorary'' Cornellian. We send our hearts to his wife, our great friend, Margie (Greenberg), whom he loved passionately, to his children Brian (Rachael) and Robin, whom he adored, to his brother Howard, to Molly Greenberg, to Larry Greenberg, and to all their families who were seamless extensions of his own. With you, we shall celebrate always Paul's spirit and his life. Alice and Peter Berglas Judy and Billy Kaufman
        SMITH--Paul B. We mourn the shocking loss of our dear cousin and friend. Paul will forever remain the gold standard for ''mensch.'' Our hearts and thoughts are with his greatest treasures: Margie, Robin, Brian, Rachael, and Molly. With much love, Michael, Susan, Andrew & Stephen
