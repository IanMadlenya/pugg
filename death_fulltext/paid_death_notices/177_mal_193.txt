        SIMPSON-Irving. We mourn the passing of Irving Simpson, our friend, neighbor, and fellow cooperator. His family moved in around 1930, and he has been an active part of our co-op community since then. He married here and with Bea, raised their family here. A quiet, understated leader, Irv served on more boards and committees than anyone can remember. Our hearts are with Bea, Rob, Nancy and the entire family.
