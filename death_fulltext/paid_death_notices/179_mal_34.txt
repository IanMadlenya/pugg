        BRODIE-David. A former steamship executive and a captain attached to The Office of Strategic Services during World War II, died after a long illness on November 24, 2001. He was 81 years old and a graduate of Colby College. Mr. Brodie was a friend to many, and a devoted member of ''The Greatest Generation.'' From his exploits in World War II, which included operating behind enemy lines as an intelligence officer, to the rescue of downed Army nurses and airmen in enemy-held territory, his patriotism and lust for life were indisputable. He was described by a commanding officer as someone who loved action and was completely qualified for difficult assignments, requiring skill, ingenuity, aggressiveness and personal courage. Mr. Brodie received five Bronze Battle Star commendations and is the holder of the Army's Legion of Merit Medal. He is survived by his sons, Edmond and Robert, his sister, Ruth Bendor, and his dear friend, Veronique Durnerin.
