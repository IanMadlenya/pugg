        SHAPIRO--Abraham B. The Cantors Assembly mourns the loss of its beloved and distinguished Executive Administrator and Past President, Hazzan Abraham B. Shapiro. For a quarter of a century we relied upon his wisdom and experience which we will sorely miss. While possessing a particularly keen business mind that he used to help nurture the Cantors Assembly, Abe will best be remembered as a loving husband, father and grandfather, precious colleague and friend, a most knowledgeable Jew and an exceptionally gifted Hazzan. He was preceded in death by his beloved wife of 55 years, Millie, and is survived by daughters Ronnye Varsov and husband Howard, and Marilyn Neufeld and husband Jay, his brother William, sister Ida Goldfarb and grandchildren Brett, Tara and Matthew. May he live forever in Olam Haba and may the memory of this special man remain as a blessing to all who were touched by his goodness. Donations may be made to the American Kidney Fund and the American Heart Association. Hazzan Steven Stoehr, President Hazzan Stephen J. Stein, Executive Vice President, Cantors Assembly
