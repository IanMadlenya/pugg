As we pause today for a moment to recall those we loved & lost in the still-raging battle against AIDS, think of Sheldon, an early leader in our community, a man who fought hard to do the right thing, no matter the cost. He would have been amazed to see where we are today, & should be very proud of the part he played. Please join my spouse Tom Klebba & me as we recall them all, especially Gary Olde, Peter Monette and Mark Fuschetti, whose lives & spirits will live on. ''Hard to see the light now. Just don't let it go. Things will come out right now. We can make it so'': Stephen Sondheim. Rest well, my love, & know that you & all the others have made it so. Jay Lesiger
