        SCHREIER-Leonard J. The Partners and Staff of Sterling Equities, with deep sorrow and sadness, mourn the death of our partner and friend Lenny Schreier. He will be remembered for his wisdom, generosity of spirit and his devotion to humanity. We will miss him very much, yet he will always be with us. Our sympathies are with his children Deyva and Michael, grandson Julian and brothers Arthur and Herb. Friends may join in remembering Lenny at a Memorial Service on Sunday, November 11, 2001, 11 AM at the Harlem Yacht Club, City Island, Bronx, NY.
