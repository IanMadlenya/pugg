        WEILL--Guy A. The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn the passing of Guy A. Weill, a Museum Benefactor since 1986 and devoted friend, particularly of the Department of Asian Art. Guy and his wife, Marie-Helene, formed a noteworthy collection of Asian art, some of which was on view in an exhibition at the Metropolitan in 2002-2003. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife and to his family. James R. Houghton, Chairman Philippe de Montebello, Director Emily K. Rafferty, President
