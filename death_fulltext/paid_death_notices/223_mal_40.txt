        RASHER--Charles. It is with great sorrow that the Board of Trustees, medical staff and management of The Mount Vernon Hospital note with sadness the death of their Board Member, friend, community leader, and faithful supporter, Charles Rasher. Mr. Rasher has been a Mount Vernon resident for nearly eighty years, and service to his community was extremely important to him. Mr. Rasher was noted for his kindness, love and support for the hospital. He truly made a difference at the hospital and in the lives of many in the community. A former chairman of the Mount Vernon Housing Authority, and past director of the Westchester County United Way, Mr. Rasher served for 25 consecutive years as a trustee of the Mount Vernon Hospital and was currently treasurer. Charlie worked for more than forty years as a trader and member of the COMEX, and was elected to its board in 1993. He diligently served on the marketing and metals committees long before that. He was most proud of his service on the membership committee, and never once missed a meeting since 1963. He was also on the board of directors at Lehman College. Charlie was invaluable to us in many areas of the hospital and he will be greatly missed. Our sincere condolences to his family and friends. Vincent Bufano President, Board of Trustees John R. Spicer President & CEO Sound Shore Health System George Haskins Senior Vice President/COO The Mount Vernon Hospital Thomas J. Price, MD President, Medical Board
