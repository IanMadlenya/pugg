        HECHT--Anthony. The administration, faculty, Board of Trustees, and alumni/ae of Bard College mourn the passing of Anthony Hecht 44, one of the world's great literary minds and an alumnus and former faculty member whose extraordinary achievements as a poet made all of us extremely proud to have had him as a member of our community. We extend our deepest condolences to his family. He will be sorely missed. Leon Botstein, President Richard B. Fisher, Chairman
