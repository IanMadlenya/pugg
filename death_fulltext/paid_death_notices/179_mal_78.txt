        ROTHSTEIN-David, 54. On December 6, 2001, of Gunnison and Denver, Colorado, San Francisco, California and Baldwin, New York. A third generation New Yorker. Father of Shay Michelle, son of the late George and surviving Elaine. Former husband of Denny and Suzan. Brother of Michael and Babs, uncle of Mark and Lisa George. He leaves behind a legacy of the music that he shared with all of us, and some very sick humor. We're still laughing at his unprintables. As per his wishes, there will be no formal memorial service. His memory lives in the hearts of his family and many friends.
