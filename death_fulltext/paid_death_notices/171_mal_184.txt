        DUBNER-Melvin. Of Montclair, NJ, passed away suddenly April 12, 2001, at the age of 63. Beloved husband of Roberta, loving and proud father of Adam and Aaron. Delighted and doting grandfather of Sarah, the five month old daughter of Adam and Kim, and loving brother to Ronald, Martin, Harry and Ted. Mel's unexpected passing has stunned and saddened his family, friends and co-workers. A kind, loving, generous and charming man, Mel was a gentleman to the core. Mel was beloved at work as well as at home. As Vice President of Property Operations at New Plan Excel Realty Trust, (N.P. Excel), where he was employed for the past 13 years, Mel was respected by his co-workers and staff alike, by the 800 employees of N.P. Excel. Last year as the Employee of the Year, Mel was far and away one of the most valued employees of the company, whose employees believed he made everyone ''work smarter and better'', and acknowledged that although he wore many hats at N.P. Excel, all the hats fit perfectly and if a job needed to be done, he was the man who would get the job done. Mel's family was his treasure, his wife Roberta the crown jewel. The twinkle in his eye and the sparkle he always brought to a room will be sorely missed by one and all.
