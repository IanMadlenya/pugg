        BATTAGLIA--Joseph The Shar family and the Lowy Staff mourn the loss of our dear friend and mentor Joe Battaglia. He will always be remembered as the gentle soul and talented artist he was, whether playing his piano, tinkering with a fiddle, painting a still life or putting his master touch on restoring the worlds art treasures. Our sincerest condolences to Connie, the kids and grandkids. He will be sorely missed but will remain in our hearts forever. Larry, Rose and Brad Shar and the Entire Lowy Staff
