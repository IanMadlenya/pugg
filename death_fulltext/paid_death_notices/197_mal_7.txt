        LATTES--Raffaele, M.D. The Columbia University Department of Surgery mourns the passing of Dr. Raffaele Lattes, a trained surgeon in his native Italy who was a pioneer in the field of surgical pathology and a superb teacher and scientist. As a member of the Columbia faculty for more than 30 years, Dr. Lattes trained many of today's leaders in surgical pathology. During WWII he and his colleague, Dr. Virginia Frantz, developed a new cellulose - based hemostatic agent. Throughout his career, his contributions to the characterization of the pathology of soft tissue tumors have become the international standard. We will remember his wit and his generosity in making himself available for consultation with surgeons long after he retired. We extend deepest condolences to his family and friends. In lieu of flowers, his family has requested that donations be made to the Conrad G. Lattes Scholarship Fund at Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons. Eric A.
