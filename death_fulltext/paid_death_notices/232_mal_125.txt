        BLATTERFEIN--Louis. New York University College of Dentistry regrets to announce the passing of Dr. Louis Blatterfein, a loyal alumnus and professor emeritus of prosthodontics. Dr. Blatterfein taught at NYU for over 40 years, very likely teaching prosthodontics to more New York dentists than anyone else. An internationlly acclaimed specialist, Dr. Blatterfein was a Diplomate of the American Board of Prosthodontics and a fellow of the American College of Prosthodontics. Consistently devoted and generous to his alma mater, he made a special leadership gift in 1996. In recognition, the College named the Louis Blatterfein Department of Prosthodontics. His passing marks the end of an era. Michael C. Alfano, Dean
