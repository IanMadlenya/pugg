        SALEH - Sabiha. Our warm and loving Nana left us on December 29. We mourn our loss and we will miss her cherry presence: Daughters Claire, Joyce, Tina and Yvonne; grandchildren Karen, Robert, Steven, Nina, Susan, Julie, Peter and Elizabeth; great-grandchildren Roxanne, Kendra, Ben, Travis, Ivy, Matthew, Alex, Zachary and Austin. Our Nana was a member of Hadassah and Beth-El Synogogue in New Rochelle.
        SALEH - Sabiha. We have lost a wonderful mother. She loved us, nurtured us, and taught us the meaning of family and tradition. We will miss you always.
        Your sons-in-law, Arnold, Arthur, David and Peter
