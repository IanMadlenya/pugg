        REESE -- Frances Stevens. The Board and Staff of Scenic Hudson, Inc. mourn the loss of our indomitable Founder, Frances S. Reese. In founding Scenic Hudson 40 years ago to block construction of a power plant atop Storm King Mountain, Franny launched the modern environmental movement. In the decades since, she became a one-person protectress of the Hudson River and its Valley. Determined, full of insight, imaginative and indefatigable, she inspired her colleagues on Board and Staff, led by example and won friendship and admiration in all she did. Devastated by her loss, we will find the strength to honor her memory by continuing her work forever. We offer our condolences to her children, all of whom are valued members of the Scenic Hudson family. Marjorie L. Hart, Chair Ned Sullivan, President
        REESE -- Frances S. The Trustees of The House of the Redeemer express their great sorrow upon the death of their beloved president, Frances S. Reese. Her gracious and dedicated leadership has been an inspiration to this institution. A. Walker Bingham, Secretary of the Board >>AD#
