        PESSO-Charles. The Sephardic Temple, Congregation Emeth VeShalom of Cedarhurst, N.Y., & the Sisterhood of the Sephardic Temple, record with deep regret the sudden and tragic passing of Charles Pesso, President of the Congregation. A Founder of the congregation, he served in every capacity and on almost every committee. His dedication to the Sephardic Temple was exemplary. A proud Sephardic Jew whose philanthropic involvement reached every corner of our community, he labored indefatigably in the vineyard of our people. A humanitarian par excellence, his yeoman efforts on behalf of a host of institutions and activities earned for him an extraordinary place within the leadership of Sephardic Jewry. During the past three and a half decades he guided and assisted others in guiding the destiny of our beloved congregation. His direction, goal and purpose were ideal, addressing the contemporary needs of Sephardic Jewish survival in our country. His contributions to that end are manifest in the activities and reputation of our congregation. Warmest condolences to his sister Rachel Haleo, her husband Hy, his niece Ellen Moore, her husband Michael, and nephew Dr. Steven Haleo. May the family and Congregation be consoled among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Funeral services at Boulevard Chapel, 1450 Broadway, Hewlett, NY, Friday, Sept. 3rd at 9:30 AM Rabbi Arnold B. Marans Hazzan David Abikzer Isaac J. Russo Chairman of the Board Estelle Ezratty Sisterhood President
