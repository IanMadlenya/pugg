The Board of Directors, Board of Education, Administration, faculty and students of the Hebrew Academy of Nassau County are saddened at the passing of Senator Norman Levy. A leader in the NYS Senate, he was a champion of education, children's needs and programs for the learning disabled. Norman Levy was a great supporter of Soviet Jewry, Jewish causes and charities. He was a true supporter of Israel. Senator Norman Levy was a very close friend to the Hebrew Academy of Nassau County and will be sorely missed.
