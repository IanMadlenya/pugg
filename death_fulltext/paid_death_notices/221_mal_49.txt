        FERGUSON -- David. The partners of Davis Polk & Wardwell wish to express their deepest sympathy to the family of David Ferguson. David was an exceptional lawyer, a dedicated partner and a cherished friend. He joined Davis Polk in 1980 and was a founding member of our Menlo Park office in 1999. David's incomparable vitality will be missed dearly by all at the firm.
