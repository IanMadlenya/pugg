Francesca has shown remarkable grace, strength & dignity, having first faced cancer 22 years ago when diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma; then with breast cancer eight years ago; followed by metastatic disease diagnosed nearly two years ago. Having lived her life with such grace, dignity and wit, Francesca spent her last weeks in character at a hospice and wanted all of her friends and family to know that she believes that she led a very fortunate life. Having received national recognition for her work as a photographer and videographer, Francesca has published her body of work in Gamma Knife by Nazraeli Press in 2005. Her video project ''One Nice Thing'' was an official selection at 3 film festivals. Her work is held in the collections of the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, TX and the Getty Museum. Francesca completed Masters Degrees at both the Columbia Business School and the Maryland Institute College of Art and received her BFA from the Virginia Commonwealth University.
