        POLLACK--Ronald. The College of New Rochelle community records with sorrow the death of Ron Pollack, recently retired Director of Financial Aide. For 27 years, this gifted, dedicated, nationally recognized expert in his field, provided thousands of students with expanded access to a college degree. He was a very special citizen of our community whose passion for our mission has made us considerably stronger. With condolences to his beloved wife and family, we mourn his loss and celebrate his life. Stephen J. Sweeny, Ph.D, President Michael N. Ambler, Esq. Chair, Board of Trustees
