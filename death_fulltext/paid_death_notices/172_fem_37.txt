        GOZAN-Phoebe Starfield of Coconut Creek, FL. Formerly of Great Neck, NY. Devoted wife of late husband Henry A. Gozan, M.D.; loving mother of Judy Goldstein, Dr. Neil Gozan and Gale Antokal; grandmother of Henry and Samuel Gozan; dear sister of Esther Siegel and adored aunt of many neices and nephews, passed away on April 30, 2001 in Margate, FL after a brief illness. Passionate gardener, fierce tennis player and ardent supporter of Israel, she had high expectations, broad interests and deep commitments. Commanding in presence, asking questions and making suggestions, she left the mark of her fine mind and strong character throughout her long life-growing up in Brooklyn; as a young wife and mother in Cambria Heights; parent, friend and tireless member of the PTA, Hadassah, Brandeis Women's Committee and North Shore Child Guidance League in Great Neck, and, finally, active resident of Wynmoor. Middle name: Constance. Family nickname: ''The Dutchess of Dignity''. Utterly unforgettable.
