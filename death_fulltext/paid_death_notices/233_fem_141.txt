        JAHODA--Maria C. Died June 16, 2006 at her home in NYC after a brief illness. Born in Vienna on November 13, 1922, she moved permanently to the U.S. in the early 1980's. Mirli was a font of joy and good will to many and she will be deeply missed. A memorial service will be held in NYC at a later date.
