        STURZ - Constance Northridge. Devoted wife and high-spirited companion of Irwin Sturz, munificent friend and family member, a person in her own right: bold, curious, savvy-with mountainous courage. Passionate about politics, she died short of the 2000 election results, to her regret and all of ours. Memorial service are forthcoming.
