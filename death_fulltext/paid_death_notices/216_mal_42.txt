        MONAHAN -- Sherwood L. Woody Monahan was not just a banker and a dean among his peers at that. His many traditional interests took him well aside from balance sheets. His very being was embodied in nurturing those special organizations that held an almost mystical meaning for him. He willed them to succeed. And everyone of these corporate entities embodied the human values upon which the tenets and traditions of these great United States of America were founded. The Grand Street Boys Association and our own Soldiers', Sailors', Marines' and Airmen's Club are but two of many to have held his interest. The SSMAC was fortunate indeed when Woody agreed to join our Board of Directors. Over many, many years without ever being asked, Woody Monahan, Army all the way, contributed thousands of dollars to keep the lights on at our hotel on Lexington Avenue for Servicemen and Servicewomen, Veterans and their families. As an expression of our gratitude, at 7 PM on Wednesday, 5 January 2005, SSMAC will hold a brief memorial service and reception for Woody at 283 Lexington Avenue (37th Street), New York. Our entire Board of Officers, Directors and Members express their condolences to his widow, Margaret, and his daughter, Sheri. Woody Monahan was one of a kind, and all of us whose lives he touched are fortunate to have had his loyalty and friendship. R.I.P. Ivan Obolensky, Chairman Soldiers', Sailors', Marines' & Airmen's Club
