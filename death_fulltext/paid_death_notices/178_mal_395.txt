        LUSTGARTEN-Irving. The Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale notes with regret the passing of Irving Lustgarten, beloved father of Scot and Brian and our dear friend, the late Marc Lustgarten. Irving was a proud and strong man who was devoted to his family and friends. We will miss his warmth and friendship. We pray that his family will be comforted by fond memories.
