        SELZER - Shirley March. Born on June 5, 1927, died Saturday morning, November 23, 2002, quietly in her sleep. Shirley was born to Esther Kwitko and David March, both immigrants from the Ukraine in the early years of the last century. She is survived by her brother Ronald, sister Sonia, her three children, Andrea, John and Geoffrey and her four grandchildren Jacob, Noah, Ari and Grayson. Shirley will be remembered for her great love of jazz, a lovely and subtle sense of humor and her beautiful smile. Services will be a quiet family ceremony. Her family wishes her peace, freedom and love in all of her further journeys. All contributions in Shirley's memory are being gratefully accepted by Temple Beth Shalom in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York.
