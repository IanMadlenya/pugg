        FRANKLIN-Ann Kerr. The Board of Trustees and the Director of the Nassau County Museum of Art mourn the passing of Mrs. Ann Kerr Franklin, dedicated Board Member. Appointed to the Board in 1989 as a founding member, Mrs. Franklin helped establish the museum as a successful entity. Giving selflessly of her time as Director in charge of the museum's bookshop, she will be greatly missed by the Board of Trustees and the entire museum family.
