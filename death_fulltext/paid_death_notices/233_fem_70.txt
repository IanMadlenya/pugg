        WYNKOOP--Nancy. February 24, 1925, died June 7, 2006 in Woodstock, VT. She was born Nancy Helen Marie Leeds in New York City on February 24, 1925, the daughter of William Batemen Leeds, Jr. and Princess Xenia Georgievna of Russia. Through her mother, she was a member of the Romanov dynasty and direct descendent of Catherine the Great. Nancy's maternal grandfather, Grand Duke George Mikhailovitch, was shot by the Bolsheviks in St. Petersburg in the Russian Revolution. Nancy was proud and dutiful of this heritage, but relished also the roughand-tumble adventures of her American ancestors, who included the senior William B. Leeds, the Tin Plate King. She was raised on Long Island, where she attended the Green Vale School. She was a graduate of the Ethel Walker School in Simsbury, CT and Sarah Lawrence College. In December 1945 she married Edward Judson Wynkoop, Jr., of Syracuse, NY. The Wynkoops lived for 21 years in Darien, CT before moving to Woodstock in 1969, where Nancy belonged to the New Century Club and was president of the Vermont chapter of the Colonial Dames of America. She is survived by her husband, Edward J. Wynkoop of Woodstock, and their daughter, Alexandra, of South Burlington, Vermont. Most of the Wynkoop-Romanov collection, including rare objects of Faberge, was endowed to Middlebury College toward the end of Nancys life. A memorial service will be held at St. James Episcopal Church in Woodstock on Saturday, June 24, at 1:00 pm. Memorial donations may be made to the Lucy MacKenzie Humane Society, PO Box 343, Woodstock, VT 05091.
