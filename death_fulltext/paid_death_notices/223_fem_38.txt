        FRANCISCUS--Sister Mary. The staff of Opportunities for a Better Tomorrow (OBT) deeply mourns the loss of Sister Mary Franciscus, our beloved founder, executive director and friend. Sister Mary was professed as a Sister of Mercy in 1958 and taught at various schools in Brooklyn. From 1970-1983 she was the principal of St. Agatha's School in Sunset Park and an active member of Community Board 7. In 1983 she founded OBT in a storefront on 53rd Street and 4th Avenue and turned it into one of the finest job-training programs for at-risk youth in the country, with professional sites in Sunset Park and Williamsburg. Sister Mary was a brilliant, courageous woman with a unique personality that endeared her to people from all walks of life. Government and private agencies honored her personally, yet she always remained humble and compassionate. Sister taught us that anything is possible, loved discussing politics, analyzing the stock market, eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, telling us ''not to worry'' when we came to her with a problem and, most of all, rooting and praying for her adored New York Yankees. She faced her final illness with the same fearlessness and dignity she displayed throughout her life. We will never forget this wonderful woman who always comforted us with her presence. Sister Mary will remain in our hearts forever and we will carry on her work. The staff of OBT extends their deepest condolences to her family and loved ones.
