        BENNETT-Bernard. With deep and heartfelt sympathy we mourn the loss of our very dear family member and friend, Bernie; our hearts go out to his beloved and beautiful wife Lois, our dear and wonderful daughter-in-law and son, Lisa and Michael Ades, and Bernie and Lois' beloved son and daughter-in-law, Michael and Stacey Bennett. Bernie was the ultimate husband, father, brother, and inspiration and best friend to all who knew him. Always the first there in time of need, he devoted his entire life to bestowing loving kindness upon his family and friends. His pure unselfish nature and thoughtfulness to others will forever be remembered; a great loss of a great man, he will be deeply missed by all of us. We love you, Bernie. Esther and Bob and our Family
