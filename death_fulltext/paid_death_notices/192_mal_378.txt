        AGNELLI - Giovanni. The Board of Trustees of the World Monuments Fund mourns the loss of Giovanni Agnelli, who with his beloved wife Marella, was a recipient of WMF's 1992 Hadrian Award. Giovanni Agnelli was an extraordinary international leader whose sponsorship of cultural activities advanced the understanding, appreciation, and preservation of world art and architecture. He embodied all the qualities the World Monuments Fund seeks to honor with the Hadrian Award, and we extend our very deepest condolences to his family. Marilyn Perry, Chairman Bonnie Burnham, President World Monuments Fund, New York
