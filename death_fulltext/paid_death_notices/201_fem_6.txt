        BORITZER -- Rose. The Schwartzberg family mourns the passing of our dear friend Rose Bortizer. Rose was a cherished friend of the family, as well as a longtime trusted partner. Rose was a respected leader in the Long Term Care industry of New York for over 40 years and set the standard for honesty, hard work and innovation during her career. Rose was a precious friend, through the good times, the hard times, she was always there for her friends and family. Her impact on our family will be felt for generations. We had many exciting adventures with Rose and Arno over the years, and for those great memories we are very thankful. She was a human being that has had a positive impact on all whose lives she touched. She will be sorely missed.
