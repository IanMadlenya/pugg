        PRAGER-Erna. We extend our sincerest condolences to Lutz Prager on the passing of his beloved mother. A true ''Eishes Chayil'', she embodied the qualities of elegance, charm and kindness. As a Silver Founder of the Medical Center and a recipient of the Jerusalem Humanitarian Award from our Baltimore Committee, Mrs. Prager personified the highest standards of Tzedakah and Chesed in her love and support of important Jewish causes that build and strengthen Israel. May the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Amer. Comm. for Shaara Zedek Med. Ctr. in Jerusalem
