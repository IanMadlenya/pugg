        HANNON-John. Members of the Board of Trustees and staff of the American Red Cross in Greater New York note with sadness the loss of John Hannon. Mr. Hannon was a member of our Executive Board beginning in the early 1960's and served ably as our Treasurer. He was a great supporter of Red Cross programs in New York, chairing our fund campaign and contributing generously to our efforts. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Vivien, his children, Bruce, Elizabeth and Christine, and the entire Hannon family. American Red Cross in Greater New York Jonathan O'Herron, Chairman Robert M. Bender, Jr., CEO
