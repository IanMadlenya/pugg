        KARP-Frances, M.D. The Board of Trustees and the medical staff of Long Beach Medical Center record, with profound sorrow, the passing of Dr. Frances Karp. From 1940 to 1993, she served her patients, her hospital and her community with compassion and great kindness. She brought an understanding of human frailties to her practice of medicine. We are all diminished by her loss. Alfred I. Osterland, Chairman, Board of Trustees Mordecai Bluth, President, Medical Board Martin F. Nester, Chief Executive
