Devoted wife to the late Leo, beloved mother of Gail Jacobs and Richard, cherished grandmother of Hilary Jacobs, Amanda Wolf, Makaela and Ezra, greatgrandmother of Samantha, Kate, and Peyton Lee. A completely charming, loveable and adorable woman with great spirit, she gave us the gift of unconditional love and we shall miss her so very much.
