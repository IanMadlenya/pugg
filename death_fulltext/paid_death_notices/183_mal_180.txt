        VARON-Louis. Passed April 11, 2002, after a courageous and valiant battle. Most devoted and loving husband to his cherished wife of 54 years, Esther (Etty). Adored father and best friend to Steve, Jay & Merryl,and their respective spouses Beth, Loren & Frank. Beloved grandfather to Dana, Jason, Elliot Lewis, Emily & Jonathan who will benefit by learning more of him as each year comes to pass. Brother to Leo and his wife Lila, and the late Morty and David. In Lou's professional life many thousands of families and many communities have been positively impacted. His charitable contributions to local schools, police and his annual tradition of buying thousands of Thanksgiving dinners for those less fortunate, express the soft side of his heart that will be dearly missed but never forgotten. Lou Varon was a leader in life, a self-made man. Dear Lou, we, your family respect, love and admire the dignity with which you lived your life -and we thank you for being you. We can never say goodbye, only so long for now, until we meet again. Your Loving Family
