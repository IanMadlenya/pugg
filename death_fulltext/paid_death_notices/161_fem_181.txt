        BERGER-Bianca. The Board of Directors, Staff and members of the YM&YWHA of Washington Heights and Inwood express profound sorrow on the passing of Bianca Berger. For more than 30 years, she was a guiding force for our Senior Center having served as the Chairperson of the Advisory Council for many of those years. Together with her late husband Alfred, she helped found the creation of the Senior Center. Bianca was a learned woman of wisdom, compassion, love and class. Her hand guided her friends, family and our agency. We will miss her dearly. Our deepest sympathies to her family. Dr. Ruth Westheimer, President Martin G. Englisher, Executive Vice President
