        WALPIN-Ivy Lee. The bereaving parents and sister of Ivy Lee Walpin sadly and tearfully announce the cutting short of her life at 48. May God give her the peace and relief she sought and deserved from endless operations and failing health. Unfortunately, love could not ameliorate her pain and suffering. Thank God for the affection she had for her ''super'' nephews, Alexei and Katiah. Shiva will be at her parents' home after the funeral Sunday morning.
