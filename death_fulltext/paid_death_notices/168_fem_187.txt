        SEGAL-Bertha. EMUNAH of America mourns the loss of Bertha Segal, beloved mother of our esteemed builder and benefactor, Martin Segal and his brothers, Rabbi Jack Segal and David Segal. Bertha was a woman of great strength and determination who was committed to the ideals of EMUNAH and Religious Zionism. Our children in Israel were at the forefront of her concern. EMUNAH will establish a living and lasting memorial to perpetuate her life. Our condolences to her daughters-in-law, our Honorary National President Beverly; also Debbie and Toby. May the family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Marcia Genuth, National President
