        SIMON-Edward. On February 28, 2000, in Boca Raton, FL, at age 93. Cherished husband of Ruth. They cared for each other through seventy years of marriage. Beloved father of Edwina Marks, grandfather of Bonnie Hilton Green and Elyse Hilton and great-grandfather of Shulian Murray Hilton. The accomplishments of his family, whether small or large, filled him with pride. His love reverberated through everything he did. Businessman, golfer, chess player and wry observer of life, his unassuming yet practical wisdom will be deeply missed. Private family services. Contributions in his memory may be made to Covenant House, 460 West 41 Street, NYC 10036.
