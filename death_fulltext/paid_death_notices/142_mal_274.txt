        PAKULA-Alan J. Community Access's Board of Directors, Staff and Consumers express profound sorrow at the loss of an extraordinary man. Recently he and his family opened their hearts to share with us their goodness, warmth, generosity and remarkable support of people with mental illness. His memory will always light up the lives of those who knew him and his work as he lit up our Gala. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his wife Hannah, his son Robert O. Boorstin and his entire family. Alfred Cave, President, Board of Directors Steven V. Coe, Exec. Director Wendy Rothstein, Dev. Director
