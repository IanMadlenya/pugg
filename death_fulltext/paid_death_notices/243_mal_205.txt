        BROWN--Jack M. The Board of Trustees, management and staff of the Jewish Home & Hospital mourn the passing of Life Trustee and former president Jack M. Brown. Jack was a wonderful man, a dedicated leader and generous benefactor. He was proud to have been involved with ''so fine an institution that helps people through the hard parts of life''. He served as president from 1967-1972 and was part of the team that acquired the Kaufman building for the Home. Those who had the pleasure of knowing and working with him will fondly remember Jack. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife Dorothy, sister Madelyn Brown Harris, and nephews Jack and Steven Brown Harris. Gene D. Resnick, M.D. Chairman of the Board Audrey S. Weiner, D.S.W. President/CEO
