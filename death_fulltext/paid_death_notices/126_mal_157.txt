        LASKER-Edward. Philip Morris Companies Inc. notes with sorrow the death July 11, 1997, of retired Philip Morris Director Edward Lasker. Mr. Lasker served with distinction on the Philip Morris Companies Inc. Board of Directors from 1961 to 1983. During his years on the Board, Philip Morris became the largest tobacco company in the U.S., accelerated its international expansion, and acquired Miller Brewing Company and Mission Viejo Company. Mr. Lasker brought a unique perspective to Board deliberations, which enabled the company to meet the many complex challenges posed by a dynamic market. He made invaluable contributions as a member of the Audit, Finance and Nominating Committees. The Philip Morris Board and employees extend their deepest sympathy to his wife Cynthia; his three sons Albert, Lawrence and Steven; his stepson Courtland; and his sister Frances. Services will be private.
