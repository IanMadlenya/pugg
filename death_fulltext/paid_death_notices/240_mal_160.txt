        O'NEILL--Trevor Quaid. It is with profound sadness that the Horace Mann School mourns the death of Trevor Quaid O'Neill, beloved father of Alexander, HM 2016 and devoted husband of Ellen Marjorie Iseman. A long standing friend and supporter of Horace Mann, Trevor was a socially committed man of exemplary intellect. Always thoughtful, hopeful, compassionate, he cared deeply about his family and the environment. A distinguished lawyer, he was an outstanding athlete, with many interests including history and music, and a good friend to many. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Ellen and Alexander, and to his relatives and friends. Trevor's remarkable presence and passion for life will always be remembered. In lieu of flowers, his widow Ellen has asked that contributions in his memory be sent to The Trevor O'Neill Arboretum, care of Dr. Steven Tobolsky, Head of the Lower Division, Horace Mann School, 4440 Tibbett Avenue, Riverdale, NY 10471. Dr. Thomas M. Kelly Head of School Steven M. Friedman, 1972 Chair, Board of Trustees
