        MAHONEY-David. The President, Board of Trustees, staff, and extended family of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute mourn the passing on May 1 of our esteemed friend and colleague, David Mahoney. In his role as leader of the Charles A. Dana Foundation, David Mahoney helped Dana-Farber to make tremendous progress in cancer research. He was recently awarded the Sidney Farber Medical Research Award for his outstanding contribution to the fight against cancer. David Mahoney's support also transformed the field of brain research. His commitment to medical research and his philanthropic spirit will be greatly missed. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Hildegarde, and to his family and friends. David G. Nathan, M.D. President, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
