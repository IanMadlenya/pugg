        LAWRENCE--Nancy Jo. My sister, Nancy Jo Lawrence, born Turchiano, died at home in Branford, CT on September 26th, 16 days after celebrating her 60th birthday. She relocated from Manhattan to Branford a decade ago. Nancy was one singular sensation in the cosmetics industry during an era when that was uncommon. Her tenure with The Lauder Companies was especially long and fulfilling. She will be remembered for her gentlness, artfulness, integrity, love of animals, makeup wizardry, motivational skills, beauty, and hope for mankind, and herself. Nancy was a victim of both physical and mental predation, Recovery was hard. Nancy succumbed to lung and brain cancer. Her life will be honored at a private gathering and her remains will mingle with those of her parents. She is survived by her sister and brother-in-law, Francesca Turchiano and Bob Bumcrot, of Norfolk, CT as well as friends, family, an ex-husband, many ex-beaus and many pampered cats. Contributions in honor of Nancy's life should be made to the Women & Family Life Center, where Nancy was a superb volunteer (96 Fair Street, Guilford, CT 06437).
