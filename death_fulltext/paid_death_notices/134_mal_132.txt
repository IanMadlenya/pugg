        NOVACK-Saul. Faculty, friends, and students past and present of the Aaron Copland School of Music at Queens College, City Univerity of New York, mourn the death on March 4, at age 79, of the visionary teacher, scholar of musical structure, former chairman and later Dean of the Arts, who conceived and brought to reality so many of our educational programs. His abiding concern to foster the best in each of us, and untiring labors to create the means to achieve the best, marked him as a leader most rare. His crowning work was the creation of the School of Music and the beautiful new music building that houses it. ''Si monumentum requiris, circumspice.'' Contributions in his memory may be made to the Saul Novack Scholarship Fund, School of Music, Queens College, Flushing, New York 11367. A memorial concert will be held at a later date.
