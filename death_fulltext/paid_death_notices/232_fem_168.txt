        ROMERO - Manuela. The Romero family and their friends mourn the passing of our beloved sister, aunt and comrade Manuela Romero on April 5 2006. Born in Astoria, New York on July 19, 1924, Manuela was a long term resident of East Rockaway, New York, a graduate of City College, founder and partner in BFW Management, and dedicated long term volunteer and employee of the Helen Keller Services for the Blind. Devoted daughter and caretaker, she is predeceased by her mother and father, Manuela Garcia Romero and Manuel Romero, her brothers Anthony Romero and Joseph Romero, and her nephew Robert Romero. She is survived and grieved by her sisters-in-law Lee Murphy and Mildred Romero, her nephews Thomas Romero, Paul Romero and Philip Romero, her grand-nieces Kate and Tessa Romero, and her godchildren Morgan Avila and Robert Locke. Manuela was a woman of taste elegance and dignity. Respected and admired by all for her intelligence and independence, Manuela was a shining example of a life well lived, of happiness achieved through rigorous attention to detail and forthright honesty. A memorial service will be held on Sunday, June 18 at 2:00 P.M., at the home of Morgan Avila, 292 Ocean Ave, Lynbrook NY. All are encouraged to join us and celebrate her remarkable life. Manuela Romero was the person we all wish to be, a woman held in the highest esteem and missed by all who knew her.
