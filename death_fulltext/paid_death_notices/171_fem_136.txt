        DONALDSON-Dorothy ''Wally''. August 21, 1907-April 13, 2001 Born in Brooklyn, New York, Dorothy began a dancing and acting career at the age of 13. She moved to Hollywood in 1928 to work for MGM Studios, where she met songwriter Walter Donaldson. They married and had two children, Sheila and Ellen. Widowed in 1947, Dorothy had resided in Newport Beach, California since 1962, where she shared 35 wonderful years with Francis L. Tooley. ''Wally'' touched many lives with her generous love, kindness and humor, and will be lovingly remembered by her two daughters, Sheila and Ellen, her grandchildren Kelley, Kevin and Scott Kerslake, and Mary and Victoria Shea, as well as by Frank Tooley, his three daughters and grandchildren, along with many extended family members and friends. We celebrate, honor and carry on the spirit with which she lived her life. For information contact Pacific View Mortuary (949) 644-2700.
