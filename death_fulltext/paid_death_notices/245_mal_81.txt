        PRINGLE--Stuart H. The partners of Thacher Proffitt & Wood LLP regret the passing of our former tax partner, Stuart H. Pringle, on June 4, 2007, in Pomfret, VT. Our thoughts and prayers are extended to his family. Stuart was a true gentleman with a wonderful dry wit and left many friends at the Firm. He served in the Navy as a Naval Flight Officer before attending Michigan Law School, as well as the LLM program at New York University Law School. Contributions in lieu of flowers may be made to New York University School of Law in Stuart Pringle's name.
