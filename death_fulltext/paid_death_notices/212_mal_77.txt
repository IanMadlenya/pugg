        STEIN--Ernest. 4 Sept, died peacefully at home in NYC. b. Munich 13 Nov 1900, emigrated to NYC '21, married Doris Blumenthal '36. Businessman and amateur musician, this renaissance man loved his family, music, art, literature and gardening in the country; read and spoke French, German and English; practiced his piano every day until a month before death; and loved his daily walks. Musical studies started with his mother and included composition with Martinu at Tanglewood, early '40s. Compositions performed in U.S. and Europe. Poetry published in '89 and '90. Beginning at age 98, appeared annually for three years on ''A Prairie Home Companion with Garrison Keillor'' playing piano and reciting his poetry. With little remaining strength, some of his last words were ''beautiful'' when shown a bouquet of flowers, and ''thank you'' uttered often to care-givers and loved ones. From one of his poems ''A Toast'' The past is fairy tales. The future dreams. The music of the moment/Is the only Truth. Enjoy it to the fullest! Here is to life which, As the bubbles in this glass, Forever newly rises. Drink deep and often. More, much more to come! Ernest is survived by sons Bob, John and Andy; two daughters-in-law and four grandchildren.
