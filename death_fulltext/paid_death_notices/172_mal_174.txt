        OLIENSIS-Sheldon. The Board of Directors, the President's Council, the Civil Support Division and the staff of The Legal Aid Society mourn the loss of our beloved friend who dedicated more than 40 years of support and service to us and our clients. Jim served the legal profession & the community at large with great distinction, promoting the concept of equal justice for the poor. As President of The Legal Aid Society (1973-75) and later as President of The Association of the Bar of the City of New York, he encouraged the legal profession to participate in pro bono programs representing the poor. His commitment will serve as his legacy and as an inspiration to all who follow. We extend our profound sympathies to his wife, Lyn, and his family. D. Stuart Meiklejohn, Chair Daniel L. Greenberg, President and Attorney-in-Chief
        OLIENSIS-Sheldon (Jim). The Mayor and Trustees of the Village of Saltaire note with sadness the passing of Jim Oliensis, longtime resident of our community and good friend. We extend our deepest sympathies to Lyn, their children and grandchildren. Martin M. Berger, Mayor
