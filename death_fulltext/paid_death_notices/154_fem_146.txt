        LEVISON-Beatrice. We at the Northside Center for Child Development mourn the death of our colleague and dearest friend, Bea Levison, who for more than 40 years, inspired us and her students with her intelligence, insight and wonderful sense of humor. Bea was the wife of Stanley Levison, who spent most of his adult life in the civil rights movement and was a close personal associate of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. A native New Yorker and graduate of Hunter college, Bea did graduate work at City College and Yeshiva University. She came to Northside in 1958 as a reading specialist, motivated by her desire to work with the children of Harlem who were in need of educational help. She never formally retired from Northside and continued to work until June of 1999 and maintained her interest and commitment throughout her final illness. She will be missed, remembered and loved by her colleagues at Northside and the children and families whose lives she touched. Memorial services will be held at Northside Center for Child Development, 1301 5th Ave (Entrance at Madison Ave & 110th) on December 11 at 11:30am.
