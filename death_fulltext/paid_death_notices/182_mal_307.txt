        WINBERGH-Gosta. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the untimely death of our friend and colleague, Gosta Winbergh, who sang six roles with our Company. He made his debut in 1983 as Don Ottavio in ''Don Giovanni'' and also appeared here in other Mozart roles as well as Don Jose in ''Carmen'', a role he was to reprise with us next season. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Elena, and his family. Joseph Volpe, General Manager James Levine, Artistic Director
