        SULLIVAN-William Mayo. The Metropolitan Opera Association mourns with profound sadness the death of our very dear friend, Bill Sullivan, whose commitment to the Metropolitan Opera spanned nearly half a century of participation in the life of our company. Bill joined the Opera Club in 1950, served as president of the Club from 1967 through 1970, and as a Director of the Association since 1969, including service as a Managing Director from 1975 through 1980 and as an Advisory Director since 1980. Bill's caring and thoughtful stewardship of the Board's Benevolent Committee for more than a decade reflected his devotion to members of our company. He will be long remembered for his quiet kindnesses to so many in the Met family and his passion for opera at the Met, drawn from his love of music, his knowledge of Met history and his friendships backstage, as well as with artists performing with our company. We recall with deep affection Bill's joy at being at the Opera House, his gentle presence at opening nights, premieres and most Saturday matinees, and especially his determination to meet his Board responsibilities and attend performances despite serious illness. His decades of loving volunteer service to our company set an important example for others and will be fondly recalled by those of us who knew him. We send our deepest sympathies to his wife Francoise, and his family. Louise Humphrey Chairman Emeritus Bruce Crawford Honorary Chairman James W. Kinnear Chairman Paul M. Montrone President
