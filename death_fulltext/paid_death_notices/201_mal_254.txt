        PERELMAN--Mark. We celebrate the long, vigorous, loving life of Mark Perelman, who died October 24, 2003 in Palm Beach, FL. His family and friends are grateful that he had the good fortune to marry Marjorie Raskin Perelman, whom he loved and treasured. Born 1909 in New Castle, PA to Jacob and Sue Rizika Perelman, for 50 years he was the devoted husband of the late Evelyn Strassels Perelman. He was the loving father of their two children, Robert Perelman of Philadelphia and Nancy Sondow of New York City, and the doting grandfather of Max and Reuben Perelman and James and Joseph Sondow. Mark was president of a chain of stores in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, King's Jewelry, and founded and ran Appliance Wholesalers in Youngstown, OH, where he was voted Businessman of the Year. He was an accomplished pilot, having a commercial license and flying his own plane for more than 50 years. Taking great pleasure in flying, travel, golf and tennis, he lived life with gusto. Blessed with a never-failing abundance of kindness, humor, generosity, determination and love, he will be sorely missed. Calling hours were 1-2 PM on Monday, October 27, at the R. Cunningham Funeral Home, Inc., 2429 Wilmington Rd., New Castle, PA. Funeral services were at 2 PM Monday also at the funeral home and were conducted by Rabbi Sheldon Clark.
