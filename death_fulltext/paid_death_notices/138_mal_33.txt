        SCHEINFELD-Jeremy ''J'' ''Jer''. Our Buddy, our Champ, our Pal, our Son. We hear your beautiful voice, we see your loving smile, we feel your ease of being and complete joy for limitless life and learning. No genuine words can express how deeply we miss and love you, your mind, body and gentle soul. In your short 11 years, your remarkable wisdom, caring will, modesty, and humor touched us in sacred ways our lives are now dedicated to remembering. You were an inspiration to us all and you will live on within us until the days we die. You were too, too good for this world. Oh, mighty dragon come will you help him. Mom and Dad
