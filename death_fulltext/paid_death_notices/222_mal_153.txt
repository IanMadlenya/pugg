        WITKOFF--Martin. Dearest Marty, we will forever remember your quiet demeanor, gentle kindness and loyal friendship. We enjoyed endless bridge games, Thanksgiving dinners, and decades of summers at the beach together (especially the one of Camp ''Jac-off''). Our hearts and prayers are with you Lois and your children and their families. Don't worry, we know that Rita will look after him. With love and our most heartfelt condolences. Fred, Ron, Gary, Stephen and all the Jacobs.

The Officers, Board of Governors, Members and Staff of The Muttontown Club mourn the passing of our beloved member, Martin Witkoff, and extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Lois, and children Steven, Robert, Amy and Susan and their families.
