        SHAPIRO-Henrietta. The American Friends of Bar-Ilan University mourn the passing of the founder and first President of its National Womens Division. Mrs. Shapiro and her late husband, Leon were among the first patrons of the University in the 1950's. She not only helped to promote the University, but was blessed to witness its magnificent development in its first 40 years. Much of that development was due to her outstanding efforts. We share with her loved ones beautiful memories and extend to her daughter, Rena Grodd and son, Dr. Sandor Shapiro and to their families our sincerest condolences. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Rabbi Emanuel Rackman Chancellor Bar-Ilan University Melvin Stein, President, American Friends Bar-Ilan University Charles Dimston, Chairman, American Board of Trustees. Brig. Gen. (Res.) Yehuda Halevy Executive Vice President Bar-Ilan University
