        LAEMLE-John. It is with great sadness that the Greater New York Council of Reform Synagogues announces the passing of John Laemle on Thursday, July 13, 2000. Our sincere condolences go to his wife Lois, daughter Sharon, son David, daughter-in-law Nancy and granddaughter Jessica. We will remember John for his tireless work as a devoted member of our Regional Board and Regional Vice President of our Westchester Region. May his memory abide among us all as a lasting benediction. Shalom, Rabbi Deborah A. Hirsch, Director Ernest M. Grunebaum, President
