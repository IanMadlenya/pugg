        CREGO -- Jean Elizabeth. Died at her home in New Canaan, CT on December 12 after a brief illness. Born October 7, 1910 in Brooklyn, NY, she was the only child of Martin Henry and Meta Meyer Crego. A graduate of Berkeley Institute in Brooklyn, she earned a B.A. from Vassar College in 1932, as well as an M.A. in sociology in 1944. She worked in Poughkeepsie, Philadelphia and New York in agencies concerned with the welfare of children. For the last 40 years she lived in New Canaan. She was an exceptionally committed volunteer leader there, as well as for Vassar College, working tirelessly for the college itself, the alumnae and alumni association and her class, for which she held almost every office, sometimes more than once. In gratitude for all her efforts for Vassar, including years of service on the Alumnae House committee, Jean's classmates dedicated a special room there to her. However, she turned down other proffered honors and insisted that her many financial gifts to the College be anonymous. Usually quiet and unassuming, she became a warrior when faced with the misuse of the English language. At Jean's request, there will be no memorial service. However, gifts in her honor for the benefit of Alumnae House may be sent to: Development Ofc, Vassar College, 124 Raymond Ave., Poughkeepsie, NY 12604.
