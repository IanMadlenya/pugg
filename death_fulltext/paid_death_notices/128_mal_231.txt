        ROTH-Arthur Thomas, ninetyone, passed away peacefully on Wednesday, September 17, at his home of sixty years in Rockville Centre, New York. He will long be remembered in American banking circles for the extraordinary innovations he successfully brought to commercial banking as CEO of the Franklin National Bank before retiring in 1968, and more locally for his dynamic role in spearheading the phenomenal economic growth of Long Island following W.W. II for which the press dubbed him ''Mr. Long Island''. His family however will remember him as a loving husband, father and grandfather whose generosity, warmth, strength, and will to do the right thing is deeply impressed on them all. His many acts of community and church leadership and his widespread philanthropy speak for themselves. He leaves his wife of 67 years, Genevieve, and his daughter Mrs. Carol Madigan of Oldwick, New Jersey, and son, Donald Arthur Roth of E. Setauket, N.Y., their spouses John P. Madigan, Jr. and Mrs. Patricia Roth, five grandchildren and three great grandchildren. He will be interred at the Holy Rood Cemetery, Westbury, New York, on Saturday, September 20, following a 9 AM Mass of the Resurrection at St. Agnes Cathedral in Rockville Centre. Visitation will be at Macken Mortuary, 52 Clinton Ave., Rockville Centre, on Thursday and Friday between 2 and 4 PM and 7 and 9 PM.
