        ABRAMS-Martin. M.D. The Long Island Jewish Medical Center Staff Society sadly records the passing of our irreplaceable friend and colleague, Dr. Martin Abrams. He was an extraordinary, selfless, and devoted pediatric surgeon, and teacher. Dr. Abrams was one of the creative forces behind the formation of what evolved into Schneider Children's Hospital. Dr. Abrams was imbued with a desire to give the children of Long Island a facility where they had access to the highest standard of care, and the most current treatment available for their medical and surgical needs. A man of compassion and vision, Dr. Abrams was an active and beloved member of the LIJ Schneider Children's Hospital staff for decades. He was respected for his multiple achievements, and his extraordinary ability to relate to others. He remains forever in the hearts and minds of the students, patients, parents and colleagues who loved him. May his family be comforted by his legacy.
