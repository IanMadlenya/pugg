        STEIN-Martin H., M.D. The members of the New York Psychoanalytic Institute and Society mourn the loss of their esteemed colleague, Dr. Martin H. Stein, a revered and honored clinician, an educator who trained and guided several generations of psychoanalysts. He was constantly sought after as a supervisor and mentor. He will be deeply missed for his brilliance, clarity and wit. As past president of the New York Psychoanalytic Society and Chairman of the Education Committee, for many years, he was a guiding spirit of the New York Psychoanalytic Institute. His renown was international and his contributions to psychoanalytic thinking were significant and numerous. We extend our sincere condolences to his wife, Mrs. Lucille Stein, and his family. There will be a memorial service at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute, 247 East 82 Street, New York on Saturday May 6th at 2PM. Contributions in his memory may be sent to the New York Psychoanalytic Institute or to the Parkinson's Disease Foundation. Albert M. Sax, M.D., President/Society Eslee Samberg, M.D., President/Institute
