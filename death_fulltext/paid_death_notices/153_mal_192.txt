        STERN-Sanford. On October 9, 1999, my son who was the love of my life passed away. He had a great love for his uncle Jack Lupu and his aunt Rusty Remin and Morris Remin. His great joy was his first grandson Jackson who was the first born of his son Jeoffrey and Linda Stern. His niece & nephew was Diane and Robert Remin and Jerry and Ira Lupu and his other aunt was Sarah Lupu. He was a man of great intelligence and unusual wit. He will be missed by all his friends and business associates. Rest in peace my darling.
