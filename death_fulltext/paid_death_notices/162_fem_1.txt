        ANDERMAN PERSON LIND-Judith. The world lost a shining light on June 29, 2000. Judy's most joyous activities revolved around giving of herself & helping others. In this way, she was fulfilled. She touched many lives with her kindness, generosity, good humor and lust for life; and nobody could hug you like Judy. She is survived by her husband Robert Lind; Her two daughters and sons-in-law, Leslie and Graham Hobbs and Nancy Person and Gary Wasserman; Her sister, Cynthia Anderman; four stepchildren and their spouses; and nine grandchildren. A graveside service will be held on Sunday, July 2 at 11 AM at Beth David Cemetery on Elmont Road in Elmont, New York, 516-328-1300. In lieu of flowers donations may be made in her name to the American Cancer Society.
