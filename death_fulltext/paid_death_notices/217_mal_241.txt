        VIOTTI--Marcello. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the untimely death of our cherished colleague and friend, Marcello Viotti. He joined the Met only five years ago, but he had already made a major contribution to the musical life of our company, and we had looked forward to years of artistic collaboration with him. His most recent successes here were last season's Met premiere performances of ''La Juive'' and this season's ''Aida.'' But it is not only for his artistry that we will remember him. The warmth of his personality and his generosity of spirit endeared him to everyone who came to know him, and made him a beloved friend to us all. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Marie-Laurence, their children, and his entire family. Joseph Volpe, General Mgr. James Levine, Music Dir.
