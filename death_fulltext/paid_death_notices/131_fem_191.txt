        SACHS-Ruth. Happy 70th Birthday 12/23/27-10/14/97 Ruth was a courageous woman who battled brain cancer with dignity and honor, never losing touch with the family and friends who were such an important part of her life. A remarkable mother & grandmother and an incredible friend to so many. An indomitable spirit who took on all of life's challenges with a commitment and enthusiasm that inspired and motivated all those around her. The very first to help everyone and the very last to give up. She is missed by many who still find her part of their lives every day. Love, your daughter Alice
