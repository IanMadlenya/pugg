        PAOLUCCI-Henry. The City University of New York mourns the passing of Dr. Henry Paolucci, beloved husband of CUNY Board of Trustees Chairwoman Dr. Anne A. Paolucci. A noted scholar, prolific author, influential political leader and commentator, and distinguished alumnus of City College, he was Professor Emeritus of Government and Politics at St. John's University, Vice Chairman of the Conservative Party of New York State, and candidate for the U.S. Senate. He also taught ancient Greek and Roman history at Brooklyn, City and Iona Colleges and Columbia University. He will be sorely missed. We extend our deepest condolences to his family. Christoph M. Kimmich, Interim Chancellor
