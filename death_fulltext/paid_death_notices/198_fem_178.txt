She breathed her last with devoted family around her: her husband of 64 years Rubin, her son Roy Ageloff, daughter Joan Davis, grandson Gregg Davis and daughter-in-law Hilda Allred Ageloff. She left three grandchildren, Gregg Davis, Michelle Bermudes and Shana Allred Ageloff and three great grandchildren, Israel and Grace Bermudes and Aidan Davis. Ruth led a productive professional life as a controller for several business organizations. As a volunteer, she gave her skills and talents to the Queens Child Guidance Center as Treasurer and Board member, as a teacher's helper in the NYC school system, and to many other charities, always giving of herself to help others. Ruth graduated from the School of Business of the City College of New York class of 1935, the first class of women graduates in the day session of that school. She went quietly and peacefully and in the end did the most courageous thing of all, she gave her body to science. Contributions in her honor may be sent to the Queens Child Guidance Center, 60-02 Queens Blvd, Lower Level, Woodside, New York 11377. >>AD#
