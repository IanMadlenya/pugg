        CANTWELL-Dennis. The staff of NIMH's MTA Study mourns the death of Dennis Cantwell, Joseph Campbell Professor of Child Psychiatry at UCLA, an intellectual father of the MTA study. The MTA Study is a landmark national study of Attention Deficit Disorder treatments. We shall miss his quick wit, warmth, knowledge, and clinical wisdom. We extend our sympathy to his wife, Susan, and to their children.
