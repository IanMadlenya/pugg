        LEVINE-Sidney. 81, of NYC and Palm Beach, FL. With utmost sadness and sorrow we note the peaceful passing of a special man, the patriarch of our very close family, on January 29, 2000. He is survived by his beloved wife of 53 years, Joyce, his cherished children Diane and Fred Morgan of Dix Hills, NY, and Carol and Willis Martin of Jericho, NY, and grandchildren Ryan, Brian, Kevin, Joseph, Russell and Jared. Sidney bravely served his country as a second lieutenant for five years during the Second World War, and spent his working years as a talented and successful dress manufacturer. He was a wonderful man of great wisdom, courage and generosity and a most loving and devoted husband, father and grandfather. He lived only to give to his loved ones. Funeral services will be held at 10 AM, February 2, at Gutterman's in Woodbury, NY. A memorial service will be held for his friends in Florida on a date to be announced. He will live on in our hearts forever.
        LEVINE-Sidney. We mourn the passing of our dear friend Sidney. He was a warm and wonderful man, a true gentleman in every way. We will sorely miss him. Our sincere condolences to Joyce, his children and grandchildren. Allan and Mickey Greenblatt ''Pat'' and Shirley Patent
