        SPRINSON--Dr. David, 96. The Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics at Columbia University Medical Center mourns the death of our esteemed colleague, Emeritus Professor Dr. David Sprinson, on February 28th, 2007. Born in the Ukraine on April 5th, 1910, Dr. Sprinson earned the B.S. degree from City College in 1931, the M.S. degree from New York University in 1936, and the Ph.D. degree from Columbia University in 1946. He was appointed Assistant Professor at Columbia University in 1951 and rose to become Professor in 1958; after retiring in 1978, he continued research at St. Luke/Roosevelt Hospital Center for an additional twenty years. Dr. Sprinson elucidated the chemical pathways by which sugars are converted to the amino acids, their regulation, and interconversion of steroids. He was a Career Investigator of the American Heart Association, a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, and was awarded the Doctor of Science Honoris causa by Columbia University. Dr. Sprinson is survived by his wife of 63 years, the former Helen Yeargain; their three children, and three grandchildren. Our deepest condolences are extended to Professor Sprinson's family.
