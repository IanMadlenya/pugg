        HOGAN-Howard T. Justice Hogan was a great judge but a greater friend to all lawyers. His opinions were widely quoted. He educated the American Bar in the principles of Condemnation Law. He was considerate to those who practiced before him, often staying late at night to hold court to accomodate lawyers, clients & witnessess so they would not have to return the next day to complete their cases. Eve & I mourn his loss. Eves Searles and Sidney Searles
