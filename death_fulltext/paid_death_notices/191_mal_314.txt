        RUBIN-Larry. Of Wyckoff, NJ, died on January 27. A passionate, compassionate educator and social activist who devoted his life to better schools and a better world. A successful accountant who rose to treasurer of Concord Fabrics Inc., he retired from the business world in his 40's to pursue a doctorate and focus on urban education, civil rights and social activism. As research director for the New Jersey Education Reform Project in the mid-1970's, he was far ahead of his time in exposing the profound inequities of the school financing system. In 1983, he founded the Paterson Education Fund, to work with parents, principals, teachers and local businesses to create and expand opportunities and job skills for the city's schoolchildren. Among his many projects was the Paterson Alumni Association, which brought together successful Paterson graduates from many walks of life to volunteer to serve their old hometown. He is survived by his wife, Alice Olick; his daughter, Annette Rubin, and son-in-law, Dr. Karl Kuban, of Sherborn, Mass.; his son, Jerry, and daughter-inlaw Carol Steinberg of Boston; his stepdaughter, Karrie Olick, of Northvale, NJ, and stepson Eric Olick, of Cambridge, Mass.; his sister, Joan Blumberg; 11 grandchildren, Daniel, David, Emily, Eric, Josh, Julia, Kaila, Katie, Miriam, Thomas and Victor; a nephew, Gene Blumberg; a niece, Beth Simon; and hundreds of friends and admirers. A memorial service is planned for February, on a date to be announced at the Ethical Culture Society of Bergen County in Teaneck. Details will be available after February 1 from Louis Suburban Chapels, (201) 791-0015.
