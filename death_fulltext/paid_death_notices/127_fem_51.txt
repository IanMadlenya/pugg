        SPIEWAK-Shirley. On August 6th, after a year of struggling against cancer. Shirley Spiewak passed away peacefully at her home with her loving family at her side. She was grateful for her wonderful life with her beloved husband of 49 years, Gerald (Jerry) and loving children Alan, Michael and Rosanne (Ebner). She was blessed with seven grandchildren: Aaron, Meryl, Jason, David, Matthew, Jonathan, and Daniel. A truly elegant woman, Shirley was admired and respected by all who knew her. Born in Philadelphia (nee Bell) on January 19, 1930, she lived in Valley Stream, NY for 43 years. She also enjoyed residences and many friends in Copake, NY and Boca Raton, Fla. Most recently Shirley resided with Jerry at the Greenbriar Community in Jamesburg, NJ. An avid golfer, an accomplished painter, and skilled bridge player, Shirley was the consummate hostess for all of the family's business and social functions, (I. Spiewak & Sons, Inc.,). She was a good friend to all who knew her and she sincerely cared about everyone she knew. Always worrying about others before herself, she had a unique way of making everyone around her feel comfortable and special. We will all miss her very much. The funeral was held on Friday, August 8, 1997. Donations may be made to Cancer research in her memory.
