        ALFOND -- Dorothy Levine ''Bibby''. Age 89, died in her native Waterville, ME on December 31, 2005. A resident of Palm Beach, FL, who summered for nearly sixty years at the family compound she and her husband began on Great Pond in Belgrade Lakes, ME, she was a woman of immense charm and grace who devoted her life to her beloved family. A graduate of Lesley College in Cambridge, MA, she attended Coburn Classical Institute and Colby College, both in Waterville. In 1943, her marriage to Harold Alfond, who would found Dexter Shoe Company and become a legend in the shoe industry, began a legacy of philanthropy, generosity and commitment to community and family which will long remain as a standard for those who follow in her footsteps. In addition to her cherished husband, she leaves her son Theodore and his wife Barbara; her daughter Susan; her son William and his wife Joan; and her son Peter; thirteen grandchildren and fifteen great-grandchildren, all of whom aspire to emulate her dignity and goodness and who will miss her immeasureably. A memorial service will be held at Lorimer Chapel at Colby College at 1PM on Wednesday, January 4th. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made in her memory to the Holocaust Human Rights Center of Maine, PO Box 4645, Augusta, ME 04330; The Maine Children's Home for Little Wanderers, 93 Silver St., Waterville, ME 04901; or Colby College, Dorothy ''Bibby'' Alfond Memorial Fund, Waterville, ME.
