        JONES--Clinton R. The entire Bard community mourns the death of Clinton R. Jones, Class of 1938, loyal alumnus, former trustee, and trustee associate. His service to and love of Bard was unwavering and unequaled. As a member of the Episcopal clergy, he was a pioneer in the promotion of tolerance and understanding on matters of race and sexual preference. We will miss this truly enlightened and supportive leader. Charles P. Stevenson, Jr. Chairman of the Board of Trustees David E. Schwab II Chair Emeritus Leon Botstein, President
