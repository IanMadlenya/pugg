        SCHIFF--Mollie. A wonderful, unique person, has left us. She was a paragon in all of her life's roles: as wife to her beloved Saul; as loving mother to her three daughters Barbara, Carole and Simone and her two sons-in-law, Jim and Roger; as adoring grandmother to Steven, Ann and Reid, Rick and Gina, Marc and Rachel, Bob E., Jeff and Maliwan, Bob S. and Francesca, John and Nina, Lynn and Adam and Cathryn and Jim; as great-grandmother to Danny, Becky, Michael, Ben, Tessa, Shane, Jack, Abe, RJ, Brian and Jason; and as aunt and dear friend to so many more. Everyone whom she met was swept into her aura. Her joy and zest for life were contagious. ''In your life....'', all were enriched by knowing her. We will both celebrate her legacy and miss her everyday of our lives. Services will be held Thursday morning January 12, at 11:00 at the Ballard - Durand Funeral Home, 2 Maple Ave., White Plains, NY
