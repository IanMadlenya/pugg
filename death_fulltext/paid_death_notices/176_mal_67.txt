        BARUCH-Marcel. The Board, members and staff of the Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA) mourn the passing of Marcel Baruch. Marcel devoted himself, for over three decades, to the care of the aged and disabled in our community, serving since 1970 as an Administrator, Senior Vice President for Long Term Care and consultant for the Schulman and Schachne Institutes of the Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center. Marcel brought immense thoughtfulness, compassion and genuine personal concern to his vital work as a leader in the field of continuing care services. We extend our sincere condolences to the Baruch family and their many friends. Theresa A. Bischoff, Chair Kenneth E. Raske, President GNYHA Scott C. Amrhein, Exec. Director Center for Continuing Care
