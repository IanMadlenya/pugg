        FREILICHER--Gertrude D., age 96, died on Saturday, March 10, 2007. Wife of the late Morris Freilicher, mother of Morton and Yseult and Ira and Vivian; grandmother of David, Nancy, Judith, and Harlan; great-grandmother of Sophie, Sarah, Lucy and Jack; sister of James, Leonard, Blossom, and the late Herman. Funeral occurred on March 11, 2007. A brilliant student already in college at 16, Gertrude, as a woman of her era, sacrificed the balance of her higher education to become surrogate mother for her three younger siblings when her own mother was stricken with blindness. Family stalwart during WWII when her three brothers all served overseas, she overcame her challenges of severe cancer and repeated pneumonias while giving Bedrock support to loved ones at times of crises. A masterful knitter, she developed that skill to a fine art form. Memories of her love, competence, creativity, and strength will forever exist. Donations to a charity of your choice.
