        KAGAN--Rachel. It is with enormous sorrow that we share the news of our mother's death on December 13th, 2003 from breast cancer. She fought valiantly for as long as she was able. She took her leave with the same love, generosity, humor and grace that marked her entire life. She was a beloved wife, an adored mother, a cherished sister, aunt, cousin and friend who will be carried in the hearts of everyone who knew her. Funeral Tuesday, December 16th, at 1:30 PM, Boulevard Riverside Chapels, Hewlett, LI.
