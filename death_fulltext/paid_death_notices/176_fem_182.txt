        LIPSKY-Hannah. The Faculty and Staff of the Divison of Social Work and Behavorial Science Department of Community and Preventive Medicine of the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine are deeply saddened by the death of Mrs. Hannah Lipsky. She was a longterm member of our faculty who retired in 1981 from the Department of Social Work Services but continued on our faculty making important contributions to our Geriatric Services and educational programs. Mrs. Lipsky's contributions to the Medical Center date from 1974 when she came to us as Assistant Director of the Department of Social Work Services and an Instructor in the Department of Community Medicine. Her commitment to social health programs, to social justice and her warm and caring manner contributed to her nationwide reputation as an outstanding social worker. She is survived by her three sons: Michael, David and John, four grandchildren and one great grandchild. Services will be held at the Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street at 9:00 a.m. on Monday, September 24th. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be made to the Division of Social Work and Behavioral Science of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine to be used for projects.
