        GOLDSTONE-Harmon. The Directors, Officers, and members of the Wyckoff House and Association deeply mourn the passing of Harmon Goldstone, who not only saved the 1652 Wyckoff House from destruction, but also had it landmarked as the first landmark building in NYC. He was also a devoted Director of the Association for many years. We will miss you and thank you for your excellent counsel, advice and devotion.
        GOLDSTONE-Harmon. Special person, exemplifying civility, kindness and humanity. Serving with him on the Planning Commission and following him as Chair of Landmark Preservation Commission, he touched my mind and heart. He shall be in my memory always. Beverly Moss Spatt
