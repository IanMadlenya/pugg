        VON JAGLINSKY-Anita A., age 78, of St. James on August 6, 2001. Beloved wife of the late Bogislav, loving mother of Suzanne Toufayan, Sandra Brown, Barbara Wasek and Peter Von Jaglinsky, cherished grandmother of thirteen and great-grandmother of five. Anita was educated at the Lexington Avenue School for the Deaf and later recruited by IBM where she worked as a keypunch operator as a young woman. She was an avid lip reader who never let her handicap interfere with her accomplishments. A lover of books, history and life, her selflessness was her greatest attribute, for she always put her family before herself. She touched the hearts of all who knew her and will be greatly missed by us all. Reposing at The Branch Funeral Home, 190 East Main St., Smithtown, NY. Visiting 2-4 & 7-9:30 Wed. & Thurs. Funeral Mass Friday, 9:45AM St. Patrick's RC Church. Cremation to follow at Washington Memorial Park.
