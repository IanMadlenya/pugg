        KAHN-Malcolm ''Bud''. The Association for the Help of Retarded Children (AHRC), Nassau Chapter, mourns the passing of former longtime board member, Bud Kahn. Although he was not a parent of a child with developmental disabilities, he was an active member of his local auxiliary and a tireless worker and advocate for children and adults with developmental disabilities. His dynamic enthusiasm in raising public support and community awareness made a tremendous contribution to the individuals with special needs served by Nassau AHRC. Our deepest condolences to his family. Thomas F. Moore, President Michael Mascari, Exec. Director Assoc. for the Help of Retarded Children, Nassau Chapter
