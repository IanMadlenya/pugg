        FEUERSTEIN - Ina Klamberg, peacefully and in the presence of her family on March 18, 2002, at age 61. Beloved wife and best friend of Andrew; devoted and adored mother of Melissa, Joshua and son-in-law Ben; cherished sister of Susan Cook. Also survived by many loving nieces and nephews. Ina was passionate, caring, and filled with a boundless love of life. She gave fully of herself to family, friends, and community, forever enriching the lives of those she touched. We will always bask in the glow of her warmth, wisdom, elegance, humor, and unconditional love. Through several bouts with cancer over the past nine years, Ina maintained a full and joyful life, inspiring all with her uncommon courage and optimism. The family is grateful to the doctors and staff of Mount Sinai Hospital for their expert and loving care. Services will be held at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street, on March 20 at 9:30 AM. Contributions in Ina's memory may be made to The Ina K. Feuerstein Memorial Fund, c/o The Ovarian Cancer Research Fund, One Penn Plaza, Suite 1610, New York, NY 10119.
        FEUERSTEIN-Ina. We, the Feuerstein Family will forever terribly miss our dear sister, and we grieve with Andrew, Melissa and Ben, Joshua and Jessica, and with Ina's sister, Susie, over our monumental loss. We remember Ina and Andrew sharing each other's passions throughout their wonderful and loving marriage-tranquil beach moments sitting on their log watching sunsets, waking at the break of dawn so as not to miss a possible Stickley at the flea market or garage sale, enjoying each other's silence while listening to that magnificent chorus or string quartet, and so many other special and beautiful memories. Ina was an accomplished chef and homemaker. She was a lady with style. Born with an instinct for aesthetics, she appreciated fine art and music and cultivated her natural gifts to a high degree. She sure had her priorities straight-husband and children, and then worthy causes including Ovarian Cancer Research and the Brooklyn Museum. We cannot say enough about her courage, valor and will-to-live to overcome her foe-she's an inspiration to all of us. We will always love her and cherish her memory. Ina's sisters and brothers, nieces and nephews, and great nieces and nephews
