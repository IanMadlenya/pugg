        FRALEY-Robert. The Diller-Quaile School of Music mourns the passing of Robert Fraley, Executive Director of the School from 1972-1976. Beloved by his piano students, Mr. Fraley started many new programs at the School. He initiated the first Suzuki piano program in the City, and, with the collaboration of Brick Church, began the Summer Outreach Program for children from day care centers in Harlem and East Harlem. The School extends its warmest condolences to the family.
