        HUNTER-Rita. The Metropolitan Opera deeply mourns the death of the distinguished soprano Rita Hunter. She sang 33 performances during her five seasons with the company, appearing most notably as Bruennhilde in ''Die Walkuere'' and ''Goetterdaemmerung,'' ''Norma'', and ''Aida''. We extend our sincerest sympathies to her daughter, Mairwyn. Joseph Volpe, General Manager James Levine, Artistic Director
