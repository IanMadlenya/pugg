        YANG-Alice Huei-zu. Students, faculty and staff of the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University, mourn the tragic loss of our gifted young colleague and friend. Alice was a rare individual of great talent and achievement, much loved and admired. We will miss her subtle mind, her generosity of spirit, her sudden infectious laughter. The quiet intensity of feeling that she brought to the living of each day was a gift of poetry to those who knew her. We extend our deepest condolences to the Yang and Szeto families.
