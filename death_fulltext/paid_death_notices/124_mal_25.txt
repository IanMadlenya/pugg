        GREENBERG-Bernard, M.D. Beloved husband of Bernice. Devoted father of Steven Greenberg, Ph.D. and Judith Greenberg, M.D., and son-in-law, Eugene Berman. Cherished grandfather of Matthew Berman. Service Sunday, 12:30 PM, at ''The Riverside,'' 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. In lieu of flowers, donations in his memory would be appreciated to Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of Maimonides Hospital.
        GREENBERG-Bernard, M.D. The entire Maimonides Medical Center family mourns the passing of Dr. Bernard Greenberg, a pediatrician who served the hospital for fifty years. Dr. Greenberg began his career in 1948, and served as president of Maimonides Medical Staff Society from 1967 to 1969. He established long time relationships with his patients, and in 1996, fashion designer Izaac Mizrahi paid him tribute at a luncheon to support a new Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Maimonides. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife Bernice, his children Judith and Steven, and their families. We will miss him. Martin D. Payson, Chairman, Board of Trustees Stanley Brezenoff, President Warren Wexelman, M.D., Pres., Medical Staff Society
        GREENBERG-Bernard, M.D. Our dear friend, gone but not forgotten. Our condolences to Bernice, Judy and Steven. Gladys and Richard Cash
