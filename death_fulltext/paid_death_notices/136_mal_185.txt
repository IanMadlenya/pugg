        VERSTANDIG-William. Died May 12, 1998. A wonderful friend and colleague, a man of grace and charm, and above all else, a man of courage. A man of iron will, determined to fight to the last breath that his body could muster. And so the unequal struggle came to its end. Everyone in our industry, both here at home and abroad, mourns the passing of one of our outstanding leaders over the years. Heartfelt condolences to his loving and steadfast wife, Inge, and to the entire family. Manny Cohen
