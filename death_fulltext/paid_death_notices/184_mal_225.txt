        GRAU-Richard. May 7, 2002. He was fearless, legendarily generous, unequivocally devoted to his family, loyal to friends, movie-star handsome, elegant, funny, smart, street-smart, strong, possessed of the most refined instincts, endlessly energetic, a terrific father to young children, the best companion as we grew older, proud, honorable, unselfish, unself-conscious, humble, sweet, respectful, loving, sensitive, tender, intrepid, courageous, sterling. Full of grace - in all senses of the word. He set the bar. He gave us everything, and in return he was the center of our world. He recognized in Mom a lifetime companion who shared his unimpeachable values, and was able to create so much for his family out of determination, hard work, devotion, and love. What will see us through these difficult days is our awareness that he knew how we cherished him - always, all the time. And that nourished him, and us, over the years, as it will forever. He was - is - without compare, without equal. And we are so lucky to have had him, to have all that he gave to those he loved. His grace will burn brightly, incandescently, eternally - a beacon in dark times, a light to strive toward. How much we will miss him is far beyond the reach of words.
