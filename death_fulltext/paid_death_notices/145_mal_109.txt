        HUSSEIN-His Majesty, King of Jordan. The American Jewish Congress, which was the first Jewish organization to accept an invitation to visit Jordan, mourns the death of King Hussein. Israel and the Jewish people have lost a true friend. The Middle East has lost a peacemaker. The world has lost a unique example of how wisdom combines with statesmanship. We extend our heartfelt condolences to King Hussein's wife, Queen Noor, to his children and to his people. We also express our confidence that the reign of his heir, Prince Abdullah, will be notable for the same combination of humanity and devotion to the cause of peace that marked the life of his father. To King Hussein we say: ''Shalom Chaver.'' Jack Rosen, President Phil Baum, Executive Director
