        LEIDERMAN - Howard. 60, on September 20, 2005 after a courageous battle with brain cancer. Beloved, wonderful husband of Ronni. Devoted father of Alissa and Darren. Father-in-law of Howard and Marni. Loving grandfather to Sarah, Aaron, Hayden and Avery and step-dad to Nora, and Sara. A brilliant, accomplished artist and illustrator, Howard was an uncannily funny man, a non-comformist who knew how to get joy out of life. He saw the glass half full and ran with it. Howard you led us all; you are irreplaceable. We love and miss you already. Services Wednesday, 11:00 AM, Temple Beth-El in Great Neck.
