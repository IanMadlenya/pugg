        FUTTERMAN--Saul C., M.D., FACS. Beloved husband of Ruth; devoted father of Rabbi Matthew and Chana, Donald and Shira; adored grandfather of Alon, Yael, Itamar, Nimrod, Yaniv and Maayan; loving brother of Amy Yeminy. A man of compassion and a healer of bodies, he was the retired Associate Director of Surgery at Elmhurst Hospital and Associate Clinical Professor at Mount Sinai Hospital and Medical School. He left his mark in this world by being an unassuming mentsch. He left his mark in the Jewish world by making his synagogue and the Jewish people his priority. He is already sorely missed. The funeral will take place on Sunday at 11AM at Temple Gates of Prayer in Flushing.
