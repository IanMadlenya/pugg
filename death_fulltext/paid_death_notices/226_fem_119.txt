Gaynor was an active and much loved member of the NYC Outward Bound family for more than 15 years, first as a teacher in one of our partner schools and later as a member of our Board of Directors. She never failed to instruct and inspire us with her wisdom, courage, tenacity and boldness of spirit. We honor the immense contribution she made to our organization and we celebrate the passion and commitment with which she lived her life.
