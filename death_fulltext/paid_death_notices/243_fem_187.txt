He taught her about music and opera. She taught him about art and ballet. Both loved reading, theater, movies, and traveling the world. They were dubbed Bealex, a one unit dynamo. Loving nurturing mother-a fierce lioness. Child actress in Yiddish theater with Maurice Schwarz, loved to laugh, feisty, passionate, beautiful, bright, avid crossword puzzle practitioner. Life long friends, Dorothy Leviss and Jean Wardell were her partners in a gallery of Asian art in Great Neck. Her family were among her closest friends -brother Sy, his wife Audrey, and the entire Bruckner clan, Alex's sister Annie and husband Marty Weis, (Alex's childhood Friend). She was very proud of having raised a doctor and a judge and deeply loved Eileen, her daughter-in-law and Allen Kopelson, her son in law. She was most proud of her two grandsons Hunter and Cody Zupnick. Sheer luck to have been born to two people we considered two of our closest friends. Jerry Zupnick and Robin Kopelson.
