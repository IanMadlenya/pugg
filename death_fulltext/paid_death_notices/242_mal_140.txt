        JORDAN ARANA--Felipe. Died March 7th, 2007. Your good friends who loved you and were your family, Herman, Aurora and Julio and the two girls that were the love of your life, Lucy and Roxy, and the members of Dueto Salon, will miss you, but are certain that God will keep you in his glory. Wait for us up there for some good dinners and trips to Costco.
