        CARLIN-Steve, 84. Died Tuesday, February 4, 2003 of the effects of Alzheimer's. Born in Brooklyn, the son of Russian immigrants, Steve was a brilliant, quiet, poetic man. His wife Peggy and his daughter Melissa loved him dearly and mourn his loss. He is survived by his brother Morty and his sisters Rose and Mabel. A television pioneer, Steve was in the forefront of television since its inception. Steve produced 19 television shows in the United States and six in Europe, including a children's program entitled ''Rootie Kazootie'', ''The $64,000 Question'' and ''Science All Stars'' which garnered an Emmy Nomination. ''Science All Stars'', was one of Steve's favorites; young people from 12 to 17 presented their scientific achievements. President Kennedy encouraged the endeavor on the first show, which also featured Colonel Chuck Jaeger, the first pilot to break through the sound barrier. In Italy, he created the first non-governmental TV show ''M'ama, Non M'ama'' (Love Me, Love Me Not) which was Number 1 on Italian Television for three years. In addition to the television shows, he also produced children's record albums for RCA Victor, featuring stars such as Joan Crawford, Jimmy Stewart, Danny Kaye, et al. ''Rootie Kazootie'', a TV favorite with children for several years, also became a series of Golden Books, distributed throughout the U.S. and Europe. Steve also wrote a Comic Strip, with artist Myron Waldman, entitled ''Happy the Humbug'' which appeared every Sunday for about 5 years as a full color page in newspapers all over the country. His many, good friends in the U.S. and Europe will miss Steve's understated humor, his wise observations and his devoted friendship. His beloved wife of 56 years, Peggy and daughter Melissa, missed him every day as Alzheimer's took him further and further away. They are bereft. A Memorial Service will be planned later in the year.
