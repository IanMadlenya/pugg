        SLADE-Carlyle. The Women's Board of The Boy's Club of New York mourns the loss of our dear friend and colleague. Carlyle was a dedicated member of the Board for more than fifteen years. Our deepest sympathies are with her family at this sad time. Carlyle Slade will be remembered by all of us with great affection.
