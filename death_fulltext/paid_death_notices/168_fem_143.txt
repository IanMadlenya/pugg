        ROSEN-Goldy Meresman. Goldy died peacefully in her sleep on January 8, 2001 in her home at Hilton Head Island, SC after a long battle with cancer. She did not give an inch to the disease and was active to the end. The funeral was held in Hilton Head on January 9. She was a superb wife, best friend and cuddle to her husband Richard for 45 years. She was a loving and caring mother to Robert and Jennifer, Susan and Chaim, Stephen and Laurie and a doting grandmother to Levav, Koby, Kinneret, Merav, Gracie and Elizabeth. Goldy was a brilliantly intelligent woman, a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Cornell University and an Honors Graduate of the Cornell Law School at a time when few women were admitted to law school. She practiced tax law while raising her children. Goldy became interested in the Garden City Public School System, particularly in the cause of educating gifted children. She was an elected member of the Garden City School Board for 17 years and distinguished President during five of those years. She had a lasting impact on the Garden City School System. She was a director of the Garden City Jewish Center for 10 years. She was a founding member of the Hilton Head Hadassah, Vice President for Education and a Director. Goldy loved quilting and her quilting friends and she has left us many beautiful examples of her work. She made everything and everyone she touched better. We will all miss her terribly, but she lives on in our shared memories and in the example she set for us of how to live your life as a quintessentially good person. A memorial service will be held for Goldy at 2 PM, Tuesday, January 16 at the Garden City Jewish Center, 168 Nassau Blvd., Garden City, NY.
