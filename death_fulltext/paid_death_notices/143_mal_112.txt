        ZASLOW-Michael. The Board and Staff of The Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Association, Greater New York Chapter, deeply mourn the passing of our courageous friend Michael Zaslow. Since the day of his diagnosis with ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease), Michael dedicated the strength of his celebrity to mobilizing the print and broadcast communities in spreading awareness of this horrific disease. An admiring media rallied behind Michael, who was supported by his wife Susan Hufford, his family, his longtime television ally Brynn Thayer, an endless list of friends and fans and the ALS Association. Michael's efforts reached untold millions and put him second only to Lou Gehrig himself in raising awareness of ALS. It is with deep appreciation that the Greater New York Chapter salutes this magnificent man whose work will remain as an inspiration to all of us. John L. Ernst Chairman of the Board Dorine Gordon, President Lauri Novick, Executive Director
