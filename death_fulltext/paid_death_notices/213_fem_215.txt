        BUCHHOLZ--Ester Schaler. On October 26, age 71. The Steinhardt School of Education at New York University deeply mourns the loss of our colleague of nearly 30 years, Ester Schaler Buchholz. A psychoanalyst, clinical psychologist, celebrated author, and gifted scholar, Ester explored the need for attachment and solitude as contradictory, yet fundamental routes to survival. Her 1997 book, ''The Call of Solitude,'' was a wide-ranging, criticallyacclaimed study of ''alonetime.'' A former director of Steinhardt's School Psychology Program, Ester studied children's struggles to regulate their behavior and published her findings in academic journals and books. Ester brought passion, energy, and caring into her classes and into the lives of those with whom she worked. She mentored hundreds of students and was a dear friend to many. We extend our deepest condolences to her husband, Leonard Wolf, MD, and to her children, stepchildren and grandchildren. Steinhardt will hold a memorial on November 20, 2004. 212-998-5000 for information.
        BUCHHOLZ--Ester S. The Postgraduate Psychoanalytic Society mourns the loss of our esteemed member. We send condolences to her family.
