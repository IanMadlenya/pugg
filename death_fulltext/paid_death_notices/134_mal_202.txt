        JOYCE-Donald. With profound sorrow Central Synagogue mourns the loss of its esteemed organist Donald Joyce. His gentle and caring personality combined with his extraordinary musical talents will be sorely missed. May his memory serve us always as a blessing. Peter J. Rubinstein, Rabbi Sarah H. Reines, Rabbi Joshua M. Davidson, Rabbi Richard Botton, Cantor Martin I. Klein, President
