        MASSETT-Jason. The Rubinstein family extends their deepest sympathy to the entire Massett family, Henry, Kerry, Jessica and Justin. We share your sorrow. We share your grief. We share your unbearable pain. Jason was a renaissance man. His leadership, intellectual curiosity, extraordinary kindness and generosity, compassion and determination were an inspiration to all of us. His sense of humor made us laugh; his smile made us smile. He was an athlete, a musician and an artist, and most of all, a thoroughly wonderful young man. And the best was yet to come. We will miss him. He will forever remain in our hearts. Natasha, Alan, Susan and Michael
        MASSETT-Jason. Jay, I know what your thoughts are; I know you are smiling and I know you are with me. You are my love and my angel and you will always be a part of me. Natasha
