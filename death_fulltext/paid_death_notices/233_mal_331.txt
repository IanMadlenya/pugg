        PAGE--George. The trustees, staff and volunteers of Educational Broadcasting Corporation (EBC) mourn the passing of George Page, a public television legend and beloved member of the Thirteen/WNET family for 26 years. As creator, host and narrator of ''Nature'' on PBS, George brought America a landmark public television series that broke new ground with its innovative coverage of the natural world. ''Nature,'' now in its 25th year, has won more than 200 honors, including numerous Emmy and Peabody awards, as well as the only award ever given to a television program by the Sierra Club. As director of science and natural history programming at Thirteen/ WNET, George was also responsible for such notable series as ''Travels,'' ''The Brain,'' ''The Mind,'' and ''Medicine at the Crossroads.'' We extend our deepest sympathies to George's lifelong partner, Dr. Dennis De Stefano, and to their family. We share in their sorrow at the loss of a man who was truly one of ''the better angels of our nature.'' James S. Tisch, Chairman William F. Baker, President
