        ALLISON-Karen Hubert. The Writers and Staff of Teachers & Writers Collaborative mourn Karen's death and send condolences to Len and their children. Karen was a gifted writer and exuberant teacher. She was dedicated to the writers - in - the - schools program and in its early days, and her innovative teaching strategies continue to inspire educators and writers through the essays and the book she wrote for us. She will be missed.
        ALLISON-Karen Hubert. Your warm, loving and beautiful face will always be with me. Deepest love and sympathy to Len, Matthew, Halley and Luke. Your cousin, Laury Frieber
