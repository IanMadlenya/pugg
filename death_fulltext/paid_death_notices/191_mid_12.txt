        FLUG-Fortunee nee Husney. Mother, you brought me into this world and gave me the warmest welcome a son could have been given. You were by my side for the good times and the bad times. Nothing was ever too much for you. I watched you struggle for quite a few years. Finally it was just too difficult. You were there for my first breath of life, I was there for your last. I watched you go to Heaven. I will think of you and speak of you every day. The love you have given me will never die. You are the beat in my heart. Robert
        FLUG-Fortunee. In memory of Fortunee Flug, a loving and inspirational mother to her son, Robert. She will be missed by all those she touched with her kindness. My heart goes out to Robert, Danielle, Alfred and the entire family. Ellen Brockman
        FLUG-Fortunee. To my lifelong friend, our deepest heartfelt condolences to Robert and his family on the passing of his beloved mother. Joan and John Miller
