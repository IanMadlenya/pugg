        GRAHAM-Edward. We mourn with profound sorrow the passing of the patriarch of our family, Edward Graham. Dad possessed a unique combination of talents. As Cantor Graham, he served faithfully the Larchmont Temple for over forty years, while as Dr. Graham, the recipient of a Ph.D. in English from Columbia University, he taught for over thirty years, primarily at the SUNY Maritime College. Most important, he was a beloved husband and father and an adoring grandfather. He is survived by his loving wife of fifty one years, Dorothy, his children, Warren and Shoshana Graham, Mark and Mara Graham and Barrie Levine and by the loves of his life, his five granddaughters, Donna, Liane, Ilizabeth, Olivia and Lindsay. The sweet sounds of his music and the power of his words will live on in our hearts and in our minds forever. The Graham Family
