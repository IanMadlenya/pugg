        LYMPANY -- Moura. The House of Steinway & Sons notes with deep sadness the passing of its beloved friend, the celebrated English pianist Dame Moura Lympany, on March 28 in Menton, France at the age of 88. Dame Moura was a valued member of our Steinway Artist family for 56 years. A native of Cornwall, Dame Moura was first taught by her mother and continued her piano studies with Mathilde Verne and Tobias Matthay. During the war she participated in London's famous National Gallery midday concerts, and a brilliant international career followed. Dame Moura was a featured artist in Steinway's Centennial concert at Carnegie Hall in 1953. Through her elegant performances and her sought-after recordings, she influenced more young pianists and piano aficionados than even she may have realized. She was, as well, a treasure to us, and her loss is deeply felt. Bruce A. Stevens, President Peter B. Goodrich, V.P., Worldwide Concert and Artist Activities
