        NEHRER-Naomi Ann Lamport. A very special lady passed away suddenly on Monday, September 10, 2001. She was devoted to her family, its history, her friends and colleagues at work. Daughter of the late Estelle and Morris Satin, beloved wife of Arthur, wonderful mother of Jonathan and Sarah Nehrer, & Roger & Robin Nehrer, loving sister of Kyla and the late Morton Lamport, and Samuel and Marjorie Lamport, delighted grandmother of Joshua, Esther and Tovah, and a caring friend to so many. She was pure goodness. She was a source of strength and wonder. We will miss her dearly every day of our lives.
