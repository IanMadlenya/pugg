        MATERA-Barbara. Kevin McKenzie, the artistic staff and the dancers of American Ballet Theatre will sorely miss our good friend, Barbara Matera. Her artistry and dedication lives in the many beads, fabrics and stitches that grace our stage. We ask the entire theatre world to join us in honoring Barbara by forever caring for those treasures we are so priviledged to wear. Our love to Arthur and Jared, as well as Barbara's family and staff.
        MATERA-Barbara. We join the theatre community in mourning the loss of our colleague and friend, whose unsurpassed talent for designing and constructing costumes made her a Broadway legend. Our condolences to her husband and partner Arthur, and their family. Martin Richards, Sam Crothers and all of us at The Producer Circle Co.
