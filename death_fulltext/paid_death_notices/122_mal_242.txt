        OVERBERGER-Charles G. The Board of Trustees, President David C. Chang, Chancellor George Bugliarello and the entire Polytechnic University community mourn the passing of Charles G. Overberger, a distinguished professor and leader in the Chemistry Department. In the 1950s and 1960s, Professor Overberger was instrumental in helping to develop Polytechnic's cutting-edge polymer program and was the second director of its Polymer Research Institute, as well as Dean of Arts & Sciences. Among his many honors were the presidency of the American Chemical Society and the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. He was also former editor of the Journal of Polymer Science. He will be remembered as a gentle man and an outstanding scholar. We extend our heartfelt condolences to the family.
