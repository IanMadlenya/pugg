        McINTYRE-Helen Pond. The Board of Trustees, faculty, and staff of Barnard College are deeply saddened by the passing of our beloved trustee emerita, alumna, and friend of the College, Helen Pond McIntyre, Barnard class of 1948. A former president of the Associate Alumnae of Barnard College (1975-78) and a trustee of Barnard since 1975, Mrs. McIntyre had a long, productive and supportive relationship with the College. She chaired the College's first Capital Campaign and the National Centennial Committee; and served as national co-chair for The Campaign for Barnard. Her wise counsel, caring leadership and warmth will be deeply missed. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Ranny and the entire McIntyre family. Judith Shapiro, President Gayle F. Robinson, Chair, Board of Trustees
