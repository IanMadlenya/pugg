        NORTON-Dudley W. The Board of Directors, Administration and Medical and Dental Staff of Brookhaven Memorial Hospital Medical Center expresses their deepest sorrow on the death of Dudley W. Norton, former Chairman of the Board of Directors and long-time supporter of the Medical Center. Words cannot express the deep sense of loss the entire Medical Center family feels at his passing. He took a personal and active part in the development of the Medical Center and had a keen sense of the future. His wisdom and dedicated guidance has served the Medical Center for more than forty years. Presented with the coveted ''TR'' Award by the Medical Center and the Nassau/Suffolk Hospital Council, he devoted endless hours to the benefit of our Medical Center and the community. He held the Medical Center first in his heart, among his many other interests. We extend our deepest sympathy to his entire family.
