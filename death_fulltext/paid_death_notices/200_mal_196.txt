        HEIM--Rabbi Leo. The Rabbinical Assembly mourns with profound sorrow the passing of our beloved colleague, who after retiring from the active rabbinate, served for ten years at Congregation Beth Yeshurun in Houston. We extend our deepest condolences to his family and to all who were touched through his rabbinate.
