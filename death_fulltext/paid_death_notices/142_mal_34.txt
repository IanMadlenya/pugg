        STERN-Anna Bunin. The Officers, Board of Trustees, Affiliates, and Members of Temple Beth El of Cedarhurst express their deep sorrow on the passing of Anna Bunin Stern, the mother of our esteemed Rabbi, Sholom Stern. We extend our sympathy to our Rabbi, his sisters and their entire family. Shiva will be observed in Tel Aviv, Israel. It is our fervent hope and prayer that the Almighty comfort the mourners together with all other mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Richard Holland, President
