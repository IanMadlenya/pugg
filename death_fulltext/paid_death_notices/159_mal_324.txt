        ORR-Robert F. It is with deep sorrow and affection that we record the passing on April 27, 2000 of our devoted member and past president (1985) of The General Society of Mechanics & Tradesmen of The City of New York. For many years, Robert served on various committees, most notably on our Library and the School Committees of the General Society. Robert joined the Society in 1980. Sincere condolences are sent to his wife, Hilma, his children Robert R. Orr and Wendy Gibson, and his grandchildren. The membership of the Society will miss him, his camaraderie, dedication and support.
