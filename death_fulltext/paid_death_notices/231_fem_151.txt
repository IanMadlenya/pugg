        GLASSER - Anne. Died peacefully at home, two months short of her 92nd birthday, with those she loved at her bedside. Survived by children Ira and Cora, and spouses Trude and Al; grandchildren David, Andy, Peter, Mark, Sally, Jud, and the memory of a 7th, Bonnie; 12 great-grandchildren and one more, a girl, on the way. Married to Sidney for over 65 years, she missed him profoundly after his death in 2002. She grew up in a warm, loving and emotional family with parents Rose (nee Entin) and Louis Goldstein and brother Harold. The oldest child of immigrants, she spoke Yiddish as her first language and learned English when she went to school. Smart, aggressive and competitive at a time when there were few occupational or educational outlets for women of her abilities, she graduated from Franklin K. Lane High School and went on to study accountancy in college. Until recently, she pursued a passion for bridge, played well and won often. A child of the Depression, she championed and instilled in her children a strong sense of fairness and social justice. She was always uncommonly informed and remained an unreconstructed, unapologetic liberal, supporting many Jewish organizations and charities and contributing monthly to the American Civil Liberties Union. She leaves to her survivors a legacy of love, loyalty, liberal politics and the overriding importance of family. Funeral service at noon Sunday, April 23, at Schwartz Bros-Jeffer Memorial Chapels in Forest Hills. For information call 718263-7600. Donations may be made in her memory to the Reproductive Freedom Project of the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation, 125 Broad St., NY, NY 10004.
