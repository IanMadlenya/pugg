Lamster, Columbia University School of Dental and Oral Surgery, notes with deep sorrow the death of our esteemed colleague, Dr. Stanley Brzustowicz, Professor Emeritus of Clinical Dentistry, on September 28, 2005. He graduated from Saint John's University in 1940 and received his D.D.S. from Columbia University in 1943. A member of the Columbia faculty for more than 60 years, Dr. Brzustowicz was a devoted alumnus and educator. He was the course director for preclinical operative dentistry at the School and leaves a legacy of dedicated service to countless students and to the profession. As a clinician, he provided exemplary care to his many patients. He was a member of the Division of Operative Dentistry since his graduation in 1943. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife Wanda and the entire family.
