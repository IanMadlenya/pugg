        LEVY-Leonard. Died January 1, 1999, late in his 97th year. His life was full and joyful and lived with integrity, grace and achievement. He graduated in 1924 from Dartmouth College and joined the Riverdale Drapery Manufacturing Co., which he and his partner took control of several years later, building it into a highly regarded and successful business. His 70 year marriage to Leona, who predeceased him by three years, was one of constant love and respect. He deeply loved his children John and Dorothy Levy, Lee and the late Nancy Gunst, his grandchildren Kathy and John Rudolph, Michael Gunst and Donna Eberle, Lee and Andrea Gunst, John C. Levy, Tom and Valerie Levy, and his seven great-grandchildren, all of whom filled him with pride. We will greatly miss him. Private services.
