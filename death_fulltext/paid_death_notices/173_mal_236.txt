        MINIKES-Jack. On June 20th at the age of 86. In memory of my father, who died as he lived, quietly and kindly. A devoted husband to our mother Kitty, and her constant companion for over 62 years. A man who appreciated what he had, did not envy, and basked in the glow of his children, Michael and Stewart, his grandchildren, Peter, Joanna, Alison, and Julie, and his great grandchildren, Hannah and Sarah. Dad, you set the standard for humility and simplicity that leaves an indelible mark on our entire family. We will miss you dearly. Memorial contributions may be made to the Mount Sinai Department of Geriatrics and Adult Development.

We extend our heartfelt sympathy to Michael, his mother Kitty, his wife Cheryl and their children, Joanna and Peter and the entire family. Robert E. Morrow, President Harvey L. Radler, Secretary
