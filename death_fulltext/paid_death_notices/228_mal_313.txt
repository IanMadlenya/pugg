        FRIER--Charles. Age 84. Loving husband of the late Anna Frier. Devoted husband, father, grandfather and great grandfather, whose love, patience, generosity and sense of humor is greatly missed. Proud of his Jewish heritage and of his New York City roots, he leaves his family and friends a treasure of fond memories.
