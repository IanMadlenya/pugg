        SMITH-James. The PhilharmonicSymphony Society of New York, Inc., notes with sadness the death of James Smith, who joined the Philharmonic in 1942 and retired from the Orchestra as Third Trumpet in 1977. Prior to becoming a member of the Philharmonic, he studied at the Juilliard School and performed with the CBS Symphony, Ballet Russe, New Opera Company, and the NBC Symphony under Toscanini. A particularly meaningful collaboration was his work with underprivileged children at the 92nd Street YM-YWHA Music School, in addition to his teaching at the Juilliard School. We extend our sincere condolences to his entire family. Kurt Masur, Music Director Members of the Orchestra Paul B. Guenther, Chairman William Thomas, Acting Executive Director
