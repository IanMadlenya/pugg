        ZUCKERMAN--Musia. The Institute for Psychoanalytic Training and Research mourns the loss of our esteemed colleague and friend, Musia Zuckerman. Musia was born in Vilna, Poland in 1938, and narrowly escaped a Nazi forced labor camp. For over a year Musia and her family were hidden by a farmer in the four foot high false attic of a barn. Musia came to New York in 1946. She was member of IPTAR, and a dedicated psychoanalyst. Our condolences to her loving husband, Martin, and son, David.
