        TANNENBAUM-Muriel. Our cherished friend. Elegant and graceful within and without. Loving, nurturing, wise and questioning, always giving and inspiring. A righteous woman who illuminated our lives, challenging us, pushing us to learn and to understand, to take care of others and to take care of ourselves. Our deepest sympathies to her beloved husband Bill and son Joshua. The memory of her warm smile, dignity and gentle nature will remain with us forever, helping us and so many others fill the void left by her passing. Gerry and Phyllis Solomon David and Sara Stone
