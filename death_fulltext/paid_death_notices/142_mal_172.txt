        BROCHSTEIN-Sam. With heads bowed, we mourn the loss of our good friend and former Executive Committee member, Sam Brochstein. Always an ardent supporter, Sam was instrumental in establishing programs of Jewish educational outreach. May his memory be for a blessing. We shall miss him. Irving M. Rosenbaum, National Chair Eric G. Heffler, Executive Vice President American Friends of The Open University of Israel
