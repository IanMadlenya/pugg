        PETTIT-T. Christopher. The Faculty and Staff of the Department of Medicine at The New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center are deeply saddened by the passing of our friend and benefactor, T. Christopher Pettit. Mr. Pettit, through his work with the Dorothy Rodbell Cohen Foundation for Sarcoma Research, has been a major supporter of cancer research at New York-Cornell. His generous spirit and strength of character were much admired, and he will be greatly missed. Our sincerest sympathies are extended to his family. Department of Medicine Ralph L.
