        McCALL-Howard, Jr. We at NYU Medical Center mourn the loss of a dear friend and devoted Life Trustee & former Vice Chairman of our Board of Trustees, Howard McCall, Jr. He was an outstanding and highly respected trustee who was a remarkable individual. He was dedicated to pursue excellence in medical education, research and patient care. Always a gentleman, he convinced others by wise persuasion. His wisdom was recognized by all his colleagues and friends. His humor was unique & always contributed to the analysis of a critical situation. We will miss him. We extend our sympathy to his spouse Jane, his daughters: Jane Politi and Nancy Watson, his son, Howard III, and his four grandchildren. Laurence A. Tisch, Chairman, NYU Board of Trustees L.
