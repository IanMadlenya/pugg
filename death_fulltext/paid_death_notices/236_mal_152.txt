        STEVENS--Oswald, age 62, known as ''Ozzie'' to his family and many friends, passed away on Sunday, September 10, after a brief illness. Ozzie was the beloved husband of Theresa and loving and devoted father to his daughter Sunita and her husband Christopher Meyers. Ozzie was owner and chef-proprietor of Pandit India Restaurant on both the East and West sides of Manhattan for over 20 years. He nourished us with his wonderful food, his laughter and endless happy memories at his restaurants, as well as at his home. Ozzie will be dearly missed by his family and friends who will always cherish his smile that lit up a room, his love of life, his good humor and his generous spirit. To know Ozzie was to love Ozzie. We are blessed to have had him in our lives and we will hold his spirit close in our hearts. Reposing to be held at Edward D.
