        RUBENSTEIN--Lawrence, 63, of Lake Worth Florida on December 6th, after a long and courageous battle with abdominal cancer. Beloved husband of Ronnie (nee Jossen), loving father of Jill and David, cherished brother of Judith Leitner, proud brother-inlaw and devoted uncle and great-uncle. Accomplished former Vice President of finance at Northrop Grumman for over 39 years. He will live forever in our hearts and be greatly missed by the many whose lives he touched.
