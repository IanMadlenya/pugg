        FISHER-Lillian J. The William Alanson White Psychoanalytic Insititue and Society note with profound sorrow the sudden passing of an esteemed graduate and member. Dr. Fisher's vibrant career was exemplified by her openness to new ideas and by her bold and pioneering spirit. One of the first psychologists to work at the North Side Center in Harlem, she also traveled to India on a Fulbright, to Great Britain for a series of interviews with R.D. Laing, and always pursued her fervent interest in the arts. Our heartfelt sympathies to her beloved sons, her dear family members, friends and colleagues. Marylou Lionells, Ph.D., Dir. White Insititute Robert Watson, Ph.D., President White Society
