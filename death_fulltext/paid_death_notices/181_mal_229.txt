        MARGOLIS-Bert. The Camp Greylock Directors, Staff, Alumni, and Community mourn the passing of one of its most beloved and longest serving Directors who passed away February 19, 2002 at his home in New York City. Born May 12, 1917 in Montgomery, WV, Bert attended Greylock as a camper and a counselor. He served as an officer in the Army Air Corps before joining the Greylock Directorate in 1949, retiring as Director Emeritus in 1995. Bert was a pioneer in children's summer camping, where his model of teaching balanced excellence in instruction with insistence on kindness, and fair play. His intolerance for bullies was years ahead of its time. Through his vision and compassion, Bert inspired many. He is survived by his wife, Barbara, four daughters: Margaret, Katherine, Elizabeth, and Victoria, and nine grandchildren. He will be missed.
