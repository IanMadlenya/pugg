        SHALOM-Joseph. From the children, Isaac, Robert, Leslie, and Valerie, from his grandchildren, Natasha and Yvonne, his son-inlaw, Nissim Berrebi, his brothers, Stephen and Henry, his sisters, Norma and Muriel, who mourn the loss of their dear father, grandfather, in-law, and brother, Joseph Shalom who passed away suddenly and serenely on Thursday evening, June 7, 2001. Joe always spoke succinctly, felt deeply, wrote eloquently, and was aways available to anticipate and answer every person's need whether an intimate relation or a casual acquaintance. He was patriarch of the Shalom family, who carried on the lofty traditions initiated by his father and mother, Isaac and Alice Shalom. His compassion and guidance will be sorely missed.
        SHALOM-Joseph. The Management and Employees of I. Shalom & Company, Inc., and Jordan Accessories mourn the passing of our President and mentor, Joseph Shalom, whose fairness and generosity touched all who were in contact with him. To Joseph, personal relationships and compassion superseeded economic and business expediency. He was a warm and generous friend, and our Company and industry will long remember his enduring virtues.
        SHALOM-Joseph I. The Officers and Board of Trustees of the Magen David Yeshivah, Isaac Shalom Elementary School, Celia Esses High School and the Joseph and Lilly Aboudi Pre-school are deeply saddened by the loss of our esteemed friend and benefactor, Mr. Joe I. Shalom, son of the late Isaac Shalom, Founder of our Yeshivah and a guiding force in our community. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his family, friends and associates. Eddie J.
