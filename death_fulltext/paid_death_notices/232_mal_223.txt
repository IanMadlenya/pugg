        HOLLANDER--Wilbur (Bill). A copy editor at the New York Times for 40 years until his retirement in 2001, died May 14 at Vassar Brothers Medical Center in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. after a brief illness. He was 80. Born in Detroit, Michigan, Mr. Hollander was the second of four sons of Emil and Berte Hollander. His father led an orchestra that accompanied the then silent movies and his early life was spent traveling with his family throughout the eastern United States. During World War II, he served with the Marines in the Pacific Theater. He subsequently attended the State University of Iowa at Iowa City, receiving his Master's degree from its School of Journalism in 1952. He worked for Moody's Financial News, for the New York Post and finally for the New York Times where he spent most of his professional life. He worked on the real estate desk there for 16 years until his retirement. According to his colleagues, he was the epitome of an old-time newspaperman with his Lou Grant smile and cigar and daily lunch at Gough's, a now defunct newsmen's watering hole, who totally lived his passion, to be a meticulous, honest editor. Mr. Hollander's wife Shirley died in 1983. He met his companion Janet Bertomen, in 1985. In recent years, they divided their time between Ms. Bertomen's Millerton, N.Y. home and a Manhattan apartment. In addition to Ms. Bertomen, Mr. Hollander is survived by his nephews Eric Hollander of Irvine, CA, and David Hollander of Virginia Beach, VA and three grandnephews and a grandniece. A memorial mass was celebrated at Transfiguration Church in Manhattan, 29 Mott Street on Tuesday, May 23, at 6 P.M. The Reverend Raymond Nobiletti officiated.
