        KAPLAN--Murray. The Board and staff of Citymealson-Wheels express condolences to Janet Rodgers, a founding member, whose lively, sociable 95-year-old father, Murray Kaplan, died after an automobile accident this week. Janet's caring attention to her father exemplifies the sensitive concern she has always shown to New York's homebound elderly.
