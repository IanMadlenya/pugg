        EIDELSON--Hazzan Joseph. The Cantors Assembly records with sorrow the passing of a revered colleague. A brilliant cantor he quietly and gently served the spiritual needs of East Midwood Jewish Center, Brooklyn, N.Y. for half a century. We extend our sympathy to his family. May his memory abide as a blessing. Hazzan Jacob Mendelson, President Hazzan Stephen J. Stein, Executive Vice President
