        BERENGARTEN-Sidney. The Faculty, Advisory Council, Alumni Association and staff of the Columbia University School of Social Work record with profound sorrow the death of Professor Emeritus Sidney Berengarten on February 14, 1999, in New York City. A 1943 M.S. graduate of the School, he joined the faculty in 1946 and served as Acting Dean, Associate Dean and Director of Field Work during his tenure. A distinguished professional who held unwavering belief in the values and objectives of social work education, he made outstanding contributions to his field and to related disciplines through research, scholarly studies, teaching and administrative appointments, and as a consultant to many government and human resource organizations. Named a Social Work Pioneer by the National Association of Social Workers and honored with the School's 1998 Centennial Award, he was recognized for his creative vision, academic accomplishments and dedication to his profession. He will be missed and long remembered for his rare integrity, keen sense of humor, and indomitable spirit. Sincerest condolences are extended to the members of his family. Plans for a memorial will be announced at a later date. Ronald A. Feldman, Dean Charles Gershenson Chair Advisory Council Frances M. Curtis, Pres. Al Assoc.
