        EHRLICH-Evalyn Frumkin. An exquisite woman who graced us with her presence for 62 years, she lost her battle with cancer March 30, 2003. Eve pursued her storied career as an executive producer as she lived her lifewith unmatched energy, style and grace. Her love of film and travel was only second to her love of her family. She is someone who valued feelings over facts, whose deeds will be remembered more than words.
