        KENDLER -- Dora (nee Perres). Born in Bobruisk, Russia, in 1916. At age 13, she emigrated to the United State with her mother, two sisters and brother, to be reunited with her father, in escape of the pogroms against Jews. Beloved wife of the late Irving Nathan Kendler, dearly loved mother of her surviving daughters, Paulette and Helene, and their respective partners, Arthur Rudy, and Patricia Grossman, and her late son, Joseph, loving grandmother of Brian and Ilene, and great grandmother of Noah and Rachel. Dora's love of family and the Jewish faith, great joy in playing classical piano, and vivid charm toward all who knew her will be missed always. Donations in her memory may be made to The New York City Chapter of The Alzheimers Association, Development Dept, 360 Lexington Avenue, 5th Flr, New York, New York 10017.
