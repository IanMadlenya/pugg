        BLOOM-Pansy Modell. The incredible loving wife of Bernard, devoted mother to Peggy and David Gershon, Robin and David Gelles, Heidi and Kenneth Glass. Adored grandmother of Jessica and her husband Michael, Rachel, Alisha, Stefanie, Matthew, Jared and Brandon. Sister of Arthur B. Modell and Selma Rosen. An Eyshet Hayil, whose sole purpose in life was to do for her husband & family. She will be forever remembered for her wisdom, strength & wonderful ability to love. As part of her total commitment to the traditions of her Jewish faith, she was a dedicated member of Temple Beth Sholom, where her husband Bernie was a past president, and she was always by his side. May her memory be for a blessing.
