        CHILD--Julia. On behalf of the Board of Trustees, Staff and Volunteers of Educational Broadcasting Corporation, licensee of Thirteen/WNET and WLIW21, we note with great sadness the passing of Julia Child-a remarkable woman who revolutionized cooking, and pioneered one of public television's most enduring and popular forms of programming. When Ms Child launched her series ''The French Chef'' in 1963, public television proudly delivered her inimitable wit and masterful cookery to America. Four decades later, the tireless proponent of fine cuisine remained one of our most respected and beloved partners, as she continued to share her lifelong passion for food that satisfies the body and stirs the soul. Julia Child was larger than life. She showed us the meaning of good taste as no one else before her. We will miss her generous laughter and her grand spirit. But her delightful lessons will remain with us everytime we step into the kitchen. Steven R. Rattner, Chairman William F. Baker, President
        CHILD--Julia. The staff of Parade magazine mourns the loss of a friend and colleague. Julia Child, one of America's best loved chefs, was a television icon, a cookbook author, and food editor of Parade from 1982 to 1986. Her column, ''From Julia Child's Kitchen,'' gave Americans an extra dose of Julia's unique style, character, and culinary expertise. She remained a friend to Parade throughout the years. We will miss her kindness and enthusiasm. Walter Anderson, Chairman Parade
