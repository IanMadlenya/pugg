        BARKER-Mary (nee Szur). On Friday, March 28, 2003. Widow of Chris K. Barker. Mother of John, prematurely deceased in 1993 at age 46. Born in East Chicago, IN, Mary was a woman clearly ahead of her time. She graduated from Purdue University, and ignoring the conventional thinking of the time as to what constituted a ''woman's place'', relocated to New York City, taking a clerical job at Sears Roebuck to ''make ends meet'', and retiring 38 years later as Fashion Director of Sears. Member Metropolitan Museum of New York, and proud volunteer in costume restoration. Longtime parishioner of Church of Our Saviour, and dedicated volunteer to their fellowship. Survived by three grandsons, Jordan, Christopher and Joshua; two great-grandchildren, Dylan and Madeline. To all who knew her, she leaves a legacy of perseverance and indomitable fortitude. So many people loved and respected her, and will deeply miss her presence, and cherish her memory. Visiting hours 7:009:00 PM, Monday, April 7 at Dimiceli & Sons Funeral Home, 152 E. 28 St., NYC. Mass of Christian Burial Tuesday, 10:00 AM at Church of Our Saviour, Park Ave. at 38 St. Interment will follow at Gate of Heaven Cemetery, Valhalla, New York.
