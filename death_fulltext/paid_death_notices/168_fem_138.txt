        KOMMEL-Dorothy (nee Dvorin). Died without suffering, at age 87 on January 8, 2001. Devoted to her family and her many friends, admired by all who knew her. She survived with strength the passing of her much loved husband Sanford and her siblings Helen, Jack and Cirelle. She lived to take enormous pride in her grandchildren Janet and David, her daughter Helene and son-in-law Gord. She is also survived by Sanford's children Carolyn and Robert, by Carolyn's daughter Deborah and by nieces Eda, Selda, Cirelle, Eileen, Robin and Marcia. In May 2000 Dorothy closed her fur buying office, after a successful career lasting over 60 years. She was loved and respected by all in the fur market. Dorothy was active for many years in the Golda Meir Group and New York Chapter of Hadassah, where she will be greatly missed. Donations may be made to Hadassah's Sight Savers program. Our enduring recollections of her life well lived and her devotion to all of us will be a blessing.
