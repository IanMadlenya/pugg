        BATEMAN-Dr. John. The Columbia University Department of Physical Education and Intercollegiate Athletics mourns the passing of John Bateman, who represented Columbia so well as a student-athlete, coach, and alumnus. Co-captain of the 1937 Columbia Football Team, he returned to his alma mater as assistant football coach and served for 10 years, earning the friendship and respect of the young men who played for Columbia. Even after becoming head coach at Rutgers, he returned to Columbia many times for alumni functions. Just 2 months ago, he was the only coach to attend the Homecoming reunion of his 1947 Columbia team. We extend our sincere condolences to his wife Anita and their family.
