        GOLDBERG--Regina (Reggie). A remarkable and proud woman who dedicated her life to her family and many noble causes. She was an Honorary President and founding member of the Ladies Auxilliary (LASHA), and faithfully served as Vice President of the Sephardic Nursing and Rehabilitation Center. Reggie was a dynamic, admired leader with tireless energy and devotion who successfully organized fund raising events benefiting the Sephardic elderly, thereby preserving the Judeo-Ladino heritage which she wholeheartedly embraced. Reggie's legacy to future generations will be remembered as an illustrious member of the Rhodes Community, the Crown of Sephardic Life. We have sustained a most untimely and grievous loss in the passing of our beloved Reggie. On behalf of the residents, officers, Board Members and staff, we extend our deepest sympathy to her husband Jerry, daughter Marlene and Steven, grandchildren Remy and Dylan, brother Jack and Pearl Sadis, and the entire family. May she rest in peace as she is reunited with her son Larry of Blessed Memory. Marion Crespi, Hon. Pres. LASHA Officers and Bd of Dir of the Sephardic Home and LASHA Clifton Russo, Chairman of the Board Michael Lopez, President Michael New, Exec. Dir
