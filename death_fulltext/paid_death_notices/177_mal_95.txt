        COHEN-Donald J., M.D. Director of the Yale Child Study Center. The National Tourette Syndrome Association, its Board of Directors, chapters, staff and membership are profoundly saddened by the death of Dr. Donald J. Cohen, Director of the Yale Child Studies Center. A true visionary, for over three decades Dr. Cohen steadfastly initiated and supported countless creative programs and activities designed to improve treatments and spur research into Tourette Syndrome throughout the world. His contributions to an improved understanding of TS treatment and the remarkable progress seen in scientific research have been seminal. For more than a quarter century, Donald mentored hundreds of physicians and researchers in the United States and in many foreign countries. His ability to create interest in the TS field through a myriad of published articles and professional speaking engagements, extensive teaching seminars at the Yale Child Study Center and by securing significant government funding for TS research has made an enormous impact on the field worldwide. All children touched by developmental disorders, as well as the field of child psychiatry have lost a towering intellect, a valuable professional and an outstanding human being. Paul S. Devore, President Judit Ungar, Executive Director Sue Levi-Pearl, Director Medical and Scientic Programs Neal R. Swerdlow, M.D., Ph.D., Chair Scientific Advisory Board Gerald Erenberg, M.D., Chair Medical Advisory Board
