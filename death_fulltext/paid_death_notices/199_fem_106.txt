        HOLLOWAY -- Patricia. 1938-2003. Patricia Holloway's co-workers at CB Richard Ellis deeply mourn her passing on August 14. She warmed our hearts for nearly 17 years with her irrepressible smile and sunny disposition. She was a friend to everyone and her absence will leave an emotional void at 200 Park Avenue. We wish to offer our heartfelt condolences to Pat's four children, ten grandchildren, sister and three brothers. We will miss her dearly. CB Richard Ellis
