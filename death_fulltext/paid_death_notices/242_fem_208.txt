        WHITE--Gertrude S. The ORT America family (formerly American ORT and Women's American ORT) deeply mourn the passing of Gertrude S. White, Honorary National President of Women's American ORT and past President (1983-1987). An active member since 1952, she witnessed the growth and was involved in the major developments in the ORT network. She saw the effect of its mission in strengthening Jewish communities. Mrs. White viewed ORT as a vast family, from local chapter members to the highest leader in World ORT. As National Membership Chairman, she increased membership to record levels. She cared deeply about ORT and was a staunch supporter of its educational programs the world over. We will miss her dedication, loving spirit and vision. Our heartfelt sympathy goes out to her three daughters, Ina, Loretta and Susan, and her two granddaughters. Judy Menikoff, National Pres. Joe Cohen, National V.P. Hope Kessler, National Exec. Dir.
