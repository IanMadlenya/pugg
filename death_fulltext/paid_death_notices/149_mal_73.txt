        LUMBARD-J. Edward. 97. On June 3, 1999. All the lawyers who served with him when he was United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and whom he referred to as partners, mourn the passing of a great lawyer, a fine teacher, an outstanding United States Attorney and a brilliant Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. It was a privilege to have served with him. The Lumbard Association
