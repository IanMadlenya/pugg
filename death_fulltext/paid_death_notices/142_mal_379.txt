        SERGOLD-Leon. We extend heartfelt condolences to Eveline Sergold on the passing of her beloved husband, Leon. He was an extraordinary and humble man whose very being radiated kindness, dignity and modesty. As Chairman and founder of the medical center's Woodlands Country Club activities in Tamarac, FL, and as a Diamond Founder of Shaare Zedek, together with Eveline, his leadership and exceptional commitment to tzedakah and chesed played a vital role in providing world-class and compassionate medical care to the people of Israel, rooted in the spiritual and ethical precepts of Jewish tradition to which he devoted his life. May Eveline, his daughters Audrey and Viviane, his sister Cecile, his brother Maurice, a devoted patron and outstanding friend of the medical center, and the entire family, have loving memories of this wonderful and caring man, and may they be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. American Committee for Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem Erica Jesselson, Chair Menno Ratzker, President Lee Weinbach, President, National Women's Division
