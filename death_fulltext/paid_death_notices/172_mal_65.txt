        RAPAPORT-Frank H. In memory of our beloved friend and associate, the late Mr. Frank H. Rapaport, whose death after a long battle with cancer bereft his family, and his friends at the Central Brooklyn Medical Group P.C. of his most needed and appreciated love, talents and advice. As a founding member of the Central Brooklyn Medical Group, P.C., Mr. Rapaport spent most of his life building and planning the Group's physical and professional structure. Our humble beginnings as a Single-Center Group to a now expanded, Multi-Center, Multi-Specialty Group consumed much of his unlimited energy and unswerving devotion. His death, far from being an element of finality, is instead a legacy of true loyalty that will always be a part of the Central Brooklyn Medical Group's glorious past and promising future. L. Kernisant, M.D. Vice-President Medical Affairs
