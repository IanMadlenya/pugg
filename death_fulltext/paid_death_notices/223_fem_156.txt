        de BARY--Patricia M. The Board, staff and friends of The New York Botanical Garden are deeply saddened by the loss of our dear friend and esteemed Board member Patricia de Bary. Pat was untiring in her devotion to The Botanical Garden, playing a leading role in The Garden's renaissance over the last 17 years. An elegant society hostess and an astute business woman, Pat was the visionary and creative enthusiast who first made The Conservatory Ball successful and glamorous, serving as Chairman or Honorary Chairman for more than a decade. Her counsel helped the Garden address many challenges, and her charisma brought many new friends into the Botanical Garden's world. The Garden has benefitted tremendously from her intelligence, energy, and stewardship. We shall miss her friendship, imagination, creativity, and joie de vivre. Our heartfelt condolences go to her husband Marq and their family. Wilson Nolen, Chairman Gregory Long, President
