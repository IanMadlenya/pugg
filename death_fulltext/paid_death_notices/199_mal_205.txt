        CARP--Robert. The American Heart Association, NYC Board of Directors, volunteers and staff mourn the loss of our NYC Board Member and philanthropist, Robert Carp, a dear friend, volunteer and generous benefactor of our mission to save lives from heart disease and stroke. In his commitment to our work, Bob strongly believed in the long term value of the investment in medical research. His vision lives on with the designation of the Endowed American Heart Association/Louis and Florence Carp Memorial Foundation Research Fellow. His steadfast dedication and enthusiasm for our work was an inspiration to others. Bob was a true New Yorker who was committed to helping organizations that made the city a better place. We were privileged to have benefited from his wise counsel and will miss his wit and zest for life. We extend our deepest condolences to his nieces and nephews and their families.
