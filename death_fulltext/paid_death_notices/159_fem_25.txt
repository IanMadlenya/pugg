        WINTHROP-Edith. Died 4/3/00. The staff of the Edith Winthrop Teacher Center of Westchester, along with the teachers and administrators of our consortium schools, are deeply saddened by the passing of Edith Winthrop, the former Director of the Teacher Center. For over 30 years Edith dedicated herself to the education of the children and teachers in Westchester County. Under her leadership at the Teacher Center, she raised teacher education to new standards of excellence. We will miss her elegance, her humor, and her tenacity. A true steel magnolia, Edith never asked ''Why?'', but rather, ''Why not?''. She wil be greatly missed by all of us who knew her and loved her.
