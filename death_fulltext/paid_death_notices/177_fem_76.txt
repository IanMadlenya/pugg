        KRIEBLE-Nancy. The trustees and staff of the Florence Griswold Museum in Old Lyme, Connecticut wish to express our deep sorrow at the passing of our friend Nancy Krieble, whose service as a trustee of this institution since 1974 has been without compare. Her personal qualities-selfless generosity, unwavering dedication, and an enormous love for art-have shaped the Florence Griswold Museum in every way. Nancy has inspired her fellow trustees to dream and plan for a bright future-and her vision and love for the Museum has led us each step along the way. We are deeply affected by her passing, but mindful that she would want us to steadfastly continue the work that meant so much to her. Together, we pledge our intentions to do so as a way of honoring our friend whom we shall miss greatly. We extend our condolences to her daughter Helen, her son Fred, and the entire Krieble family
