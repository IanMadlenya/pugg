        STEINBERG-Lillian. A universally admired and beloved leader of the American Jewish Congress for over 50 years, she embodied and personified the liberal ideals that animate American Jewish life. As a foremost leader of the organization, she played an inspiring role in every aspect of its work. Lillian and her late husband Martin founded and sponsored the Martin Steinberg Cultural Center, which nurtured generations of young Jewish artists. She was the guiding spirit of the Louise Waterman Wise Hostel in Jerusalem, which provides lodging and an encouraging environment for young Jews seeking to find their place in Israel. Lillian was especially passionate in advocating the right of women to play their rightful role in public and communal life. The many titles she held in the AJCongress do not adequately convey the special admiration and affection in which she was regarded by all our membership and staff. A strong and independentminded woman down to the end, she was especially fortunate to have the invaluable and constant attention of Cookie Pikulik, her surrogate daughter, protector and friend.
