        RABINOVE-Samuel. 1923-2002. ''The First Amendment guarantee of free exercise of religion means freedom from governmental impediment. It was never intended to mean freedom from private expense, any more than the constitutional guarantee of freedom of the press entitles indigent would-be newspaper publishers to government funding to publish their newspapers.'' Samuel Rabinove, 1992. The American Civil Liberties Union is deeply saddened by the death of our friend & ally Samuel Rabinove, legal director of the American Jewish Committee, who loved America and the American Constitution and worked to preserve the separation of church and state. His passing stills one of liberty's most eloquent voices, but his cause lives on.
