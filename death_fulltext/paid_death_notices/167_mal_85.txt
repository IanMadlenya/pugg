        SUVALL-Max.The officers and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Max Suvall whose family has embraced his legacy of righteous deeds and Jewish community leadership. His son, Marc, is a former chair of our Commission on Jewish Identity and Renewal. Marc's wife, Harriet, a guiding light on our Women's Campaign Executive Board, created a teen center at our affiliated JCC of MidWestchester, and started Operation Mitzvah in Westchester. Our deepest sympathies go to them; his other children, Michael and Susan, and their spouses; his grandchildren, David and Cara; his beloved friend, Jesse; and the entire family. May all who benefited from Max's kindness and wisdom be consoled among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. James S. Tisch, President Larry Zicklin, Board Chair John S. Ruskay, Exec VP & CEO
