        ENGELHARD--Jane. The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn the passing of Jane Engelhard, whose generosity--together with that of her late husband Charles--enhanced a whole generation in the life of the Metropolitan Museum. Beginning in 1968, they donated works of art as well as funds for a broad range of activities, from acquisitions and building initiaties to exhibitions and curatorial programs. Always thoughtful and involved as Trustee from 1974 to 1981, and as Trustee Emerita in the years since, she helped to guide this institution through an important period of growth and advancement. One of the most loved spaces at the Metropolitan, The Charles Englehard Court--an airy, glass-enclosed garden for the display of American sculpture and architecture that serves as the gateway to the vast collections of The American Wing--is a tribute to the vision and devotion of the Englehards that will inspire and enlighten visitors for many years to come. To our beloved Vice Chairman Annette de la Renta, and to the entire family, we extend our deep condolences. James R. Houghton, Chairman Philippe de Montebello, Director David E. McKinney, President
