        BARBARO--Barbaro. On behalf of the Belmont Child Care Association and the families of Anna House, we send our condolences to our board member Gretchen Jackson and her husband Roy on the passing of Barbaro. We are deeply grateful to Dr. Dean Richardson and all at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine who tried so vainly to save him. Barbaro will never be forgotten. Fay Donk, President Donna Chenkin, Executive Director
