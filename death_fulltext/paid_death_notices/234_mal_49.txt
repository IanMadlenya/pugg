        MURRAY--Jan. The Officers, Governors and Members of the New York Friars Club deeply mourn the loss of their beloved and esteemed member Jan Murray. Jan was the consummate court jester who gave the gift of laughter. He was a master craftsman of humor who brought the Friars Club to hilarious heights during his Roast and Dinner appearances. His humor and love of life will be sorely missed by all the Friars. We are honored and proud to have been touched by the comedy legend that will always be Jan Murray. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his family. Jerry Lewis, Abbot Freddie Roman, Dean Jean-Pierre Trebot, Executive Director
