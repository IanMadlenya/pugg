        DRILLINGS-Joel. We travelled together through many worlds and times. Your pure spirit infused us all with joy and possibilities unlimited. We'll miss your smiling face, your sweet song, your broad shoulders and your big reach. We'll miss you in the snow and by the sea. See you when we get there... Jesse and Linda and Larry and Linda and Julie and Deborah
        DRILLINGS-Joel. We will forever treasure your memory. We will preserve it and pass it carefully to future generations. We will place it safely within the tides so that it may carry to the far ends of the earth and be reflected to the outer reaches of the universe. You have enriched our lives. May your soul enrich all things living for eternity. Lynne and Malcolm Sage

Our hearts go out to his wife, Wendy, to Josh, and Lea, and to his inlaws, former Fire Commissioner, Bill Manowitz and his wife, Joanne. We will miss him.
