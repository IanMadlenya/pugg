        LYNCH-Sister Patricia. Of Englewood, NJ on April 19, 2002. Former president and CEO of Holy Name Hospital, Teaneck, NJ and founding Board member of Gilda's Club Northern New Jersey. The Board and staff of Gilda's Club Northern New Jersey mourn the loss of Sister Patricia Lynch, CSJP. She not only contributed her vision and wise counsel but also rolled up her sleeves to supervise the construction of our clubhouse-a warm and welcoming place where people living with cancer can gather with families and friends for social and emotional support. She was our ''steel magnolia'' and we shall miss her wisdom, her wit, and her courage!
