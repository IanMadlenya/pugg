        LONDON-Pearl. The Poetry Society of America wishes to pay tribute to Pearl London. Elegant and energetic proponent of the art of poetry, gifted and inspiring teacher, generous and devoted member of the Board of Governors of the Poetry Society of America. We mourn her and will miss her. Funeral services will be held today at Temple Emanu-El, 5th Ave. at 65 St., 12 noon.
        LONDON-Pearl. A ''woman of valor'' whose worth was ''far beyond that of rubies,'' a cosmic mother, a woman of consummate charm, grace, wisdom, and generosity. You were my guide and my mentor. I am eternally grateful to you for that. Anna Rabinowitz
