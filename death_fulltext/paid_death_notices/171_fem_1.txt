        ANGEL-Frances H. The National Board of the National Council of Jewish Women is deeply saddened by the loss of a distinguished leader and dear friend, Frances Hannah Levy Angel. Frances dedicated herself to improving the lives of women, children, and families here and in Israel, continuing the proud legacy started by her grandmother, NCJW founder, Hannah G. Solomon. Frances helped to launch the Charleston Section of NCJW in 1949. Her work-focusing on health, family, and women's rights issuesplaced her in the forefront of both challenge and change. Frances was a respected community leader in her hometown of Charleston, playing a prominent role in many medical, artistic, and service-oriented groups. In recognition of her efforts to improve the lives of others, Frances was awarded the prestigious NCJW Hannah G. Solomon Award named for her grandmother. Frances' work and spirit will remain an inspiration to us all. Memorial services will be held at 2 PM Sunday, April 1, 2001 at Temple Israel, Charleston, West Virginia.
