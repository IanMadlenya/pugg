        $(6$)FARBER--Saul J., MD. It is with deep sorrow that I learned of the passing of Saul Farber. I well recall our first meeting over 60 years ago, when my wife, Lois who was his first technician invited him to dinner. He arrived late because a homeless man needed care and had just been admitted to Bellevue. He left our phone number in case the patient took a turn. That incident left an indelible impression on me of the doctor and the man that lasted throughout the many years of our acquaintance. Love to Doris and the family. Eli Schonberger
