        LAMBERTSEN-Eleanor C., Ed.D., R.N. The New York and Presbyterian Hospital & the Divisions of Nursing are deeply saddened by the passing of our beloved friend and dear colleague Eleanor Lambertsen. She served as Dean of the Cornell University New York Hospital School of Nursing from 1970 to 1979 and as Senior Associate Director of Nursing Service at The New York Hospital from 1974 to 1982. A national and international leader in the field of nursing, Dr. Lambertsen's pioneering work in patient care delivery has been used as a model throughout the world. Many of her publications were translated for use abroad. Dr. Lambertsen held innumerable appointed positions in nursing organizations and served on a number of boards and advisory committees. She was a member of the Surgeon General's Consultant Group which spearheaded the first Nurse Training Act, a source of significant federal funding for nursing education, and a member of the 1971 federal advisory group which called for significant increased authority for nursing practitioners. We mourn the loss of this dynamic educator and spokesperson for nursing, who leaves a legacy of scholarship and dedication. She was much loved and will be greatly missed. Our sincere condolences are extended to her family. David B. Skinner, M.D. Vice Chairman and CEO William T. Speck, M.D. President and COO Doris M. Glick, R.N. Vice President, Nursing Darlene L. Cox, R.N. Vice Pres., Patient Care Services The New York and Presbyterian Hospital
