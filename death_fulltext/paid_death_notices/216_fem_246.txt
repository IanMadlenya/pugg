        ANDREWS -- Sara Sonsol. Friends and relatives mourn the passing of Sara Sonsol Andrews on January 23, 2005, after a long illness. Sara was a longtime activist in the National Organization for Women, where she served on the Board of Directors for many years; in the anti-war movement, and in the Downtown Independent Democrats. She also served as Treasurer of the Board of Directors of Southbridge Towers, where she lived for more than 30 years. As a child, she emigrated from Italy with her family who were fleeing Nazi persecution of Jews. She was raised in the Bronx, and as an adult worked as a Controller for many companies. Her community of friends will miss her strong convictions and her dedication to women's issues. She will be missed by her reading group friends and many others whose lives she touched. She will be buried on Tuesday, January 25. A memorial is being planned for March, with date, time and location to be announced.
