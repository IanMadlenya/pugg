        SESINOVA-Alena. September 11, 2001, World Trade Center, Tower One, 96th floor. Irreplaceable, beloved friend, who having escaped Communist Czechoslovakia, fulfilled her dream of coming to America. A passionate intellect, she loved life & had a heart of gold. Among all of her endearing qualities, she will always be remembered for her fondness for spicy foods & red wine & the comical situations that resulted from, more often than not, the latter. She is survived by her companion of 22 yrs, her mother in Prague & her friends on both continents. Nanette Shaw & Isa Goldberg
