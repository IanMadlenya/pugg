        HOLLOMAN-John L.S. Jr., M.D. The William F. Ryan Community Health Center family gratefully acknowledges and humbly celebrates the spirit and dedication of Dr. John ''Mike'' L.S. Holloman, our medical director for the past 21 years. A man of immense compassion and profound concern for the medically vulnerable in our city and throughout the world, Dr. Holloman saw the rampant inequality in accessibility and availability of medical care as an affront to human dignity, and as a call to action. Although his accomplishments were numerous and his roles as a respected advocate for the disenfranchised were many, Mike would want most to be remembered as a physician whose heart was moved by human suffering and whose personal and professional life was devoted to alleviating this suffering. Wonderful friend, extraordinary teacher, accomplished clinical leader, Mike touched the very soul of everyone he met. His love and dedication have not died and continue to live in his friends at Ryan. Visitation Sunday, March 3rd, 2-6 PM, service 6 PM. Bentas Funeral Home, 630 St. Nicholas Ave. (212) 281-8850. In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to Virginia Union University, Richmond, VA. A memorial service is being planned for April. Bobbie Maniece-Harrison, Chair Barbra E. Minch, President
