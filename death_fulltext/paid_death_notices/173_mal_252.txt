        GINSBERG-Albert. Boys Town Jerusalem mourns with profound sorrow the passing of Albert Ginsberg, esteemed Vice President, Board Member, valued member of our extended family, but most of all, cherished friend. Al was a kind, sensitive and caring person, as evidenced by his reaching out to help those in need. His wisdom, guidance and brilliant counsel was sought by all, whether family, friends or colleagues. Al was a self-made man, coming from simple beginnings on the Lower East Side and rising to become a most highly regarded and respected businessman whose vision and staunch determination enabled him to see opportunity that escaped others. Al's devotion to his family was exemplary. The same man who developed, negotiated and oversaw a complex business deal, would come home that night and get down on the floor to play with his grandchildren. Al identified heart and soul with the students of Boys Town, recognizing that an excellent education, coupled with a lofty value system, represented the best hope for these young boys from limited backgrounds to emerge as young men with limitless futures. Together with his beloved Pearl, the Ginsbergs established a major endowment at Boys Town providing the gift of opportunity for disadvantaged Israeli youth. We extend heartfelt condolences to Pearl, his partner in life for over 50 years; children Liane, Larry and Hilary; grandchildren Sean, Sara, Daniel, Heather and Josh, and the entire family. Rabbi Moshe Linchner, Dean Michael J. Scharf, President Raphael Benaroya, Chairman Josh S. Weston Honorary Chairman Rabbi Ronald Gray, Exec. V.P.
