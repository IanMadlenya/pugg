        BERGER-Martin M., 75. Wonderful father and husband, respected Mayor of Saltaire, successful real estate attorney and passionate defender of civil liberties, died Tuesday from lung cancer. A brilliant legal mind, he often gave his legal and political talents to support those needing a champion, from civil rights workers to gay job applicants to affordable housing organizations. He helped found the Downtown Independent Democrats and was president of the Village Independent Democrats. He is remembered for his lively mind, ingenuity, commitment to social justice, joyful gardening, omnivorous curiosity and wry sense of humor. Survived by his wife of 36 years, Kathleen (Keen); his four daughters: Bethany, Rachel, Elissa, and Sarah; and his brother, Howard. They will always treasure his boundless love. Donations in his memory to: Doctors Without Borders, Box 1856, Merrifield, VA 22116. A memorial and celebration will be held on Sunday, March 2, at 4 PM at Judson Memorial Church, 55 Washington Square So NYC.
