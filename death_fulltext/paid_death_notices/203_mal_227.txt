        MULHEREN--John A., Jr. A prince among men, John Mulheren's untimely passing is a tragic and sudden loss for many. A visionary of the ''Street,'' I will miss his brilliant mind, but moreover, his large and giving heart. John was devoted not only to many causes, but to his community and loving family. What he did for others remains a lasting testimony to his remarkable character. I was proud to be his friend and partner. It can truly be said that ''only the good die young.'' I extend my deepest sympathies to Nancy and the entire Mulheren family. S. Donald Sussman
        MULHEREN--John A. The Board of Directors of the New York Service for the Handicapped are deeply saddened at the death of John Mulheren, who was a generous supporter of Camp Oakhurst. He helped to develop the recreational programs for disabled children at the Camp in Monmouth County, NJ. To his family go our heartfelt condolences. Marilyn Friedman, President
