        BAKER--George F. III. The NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and Weill Cornell Medical College mourn the tragic death of our beloved and esteemed friend and Trustee George F. Baker. A creative and uniquely talented man of strong commitment and outstanding intellect, Mr. Baker was elected Governor of The Society of the New York Hospital in 1977 and went on to serve on the Board of the merged NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, the third generation of his family to do so. The family's deep interest and dedication to the New York Hospital dateback to 1899, and the Baker Pavilion of the NewYork - Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center stands as a monument to their loyalty and service to the Medical Center. During his 28 years of Board service, Mr. Baker served on several Board committees, including Executive, Finance, and Nominating. He was honored as New York Hospital's Trustee of the Year in 1996. Since 1981, Mr. Baker has been an outstanding Chairman of the Hospital's Investment Committee, where his astute stewardship of its endowment and retirement funds has been invaluable. He served as Vice Chairman of the NewYorkPresbyterian Fund, Inc. (formerly The Society of The New York Hospital Fund, Inc.), and Vice President, and later President, of The New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell Medical Center Fund, Inc. (formerly The New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center Fund, Inc.). We will profoundly miss his abiding friendship, his wit, and his wise counsel. We will cherish his memory with the greatest affection. Our deepest sympathies go to the Baker family.
