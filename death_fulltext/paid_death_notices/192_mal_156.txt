        DEAN-George Alden. With love and sadness we mourn the passing of George Dean of Southport, CT. Beloved husband of Jane Kentnor Dean, father of Jay Dean, Diane Dean Stocks, Jeffrey Pratt and Susan Pratt. Princeton graduate, Korea veteran, and advertising executive for over 30 years. In retirement he dedicated himself to the encouragement and support of women running for public office, as a tireless champion, mentor and unifying force. His patient and reasoned words moved minds and inspired others to action. Generous with his time, he enthusiastically served on numerous charitable boards. Equally generous with his affection, his treasured friendships cross physical, political and ideological boundaries. A courageous man, wonderful friend, and true patriot, his family and many friends will deeply miss him. His family suggests a donation to the Women's Campaign School at Yale University, the United VNA of Trumbull, CT, or any of the charities he loved and supported.
