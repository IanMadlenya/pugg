        LESSER--Ruth. We deeply mourn the loss of our most esteemed Professor and Clinic Director, Dr. Ruth Lesser. For over 40 years, Dr. Lesser's unfailing dedication has left an indelible mark on all who knew her. Compassionate analyst, outstanding teacher, supervisor, mentor, she has been a leader in our community. Her passion, integrity, honesty and zest for life will be missed by all of us who have had the privilege to work with her. Her legacy will be with us forever. Our heartfelt condolences to her beloved family. Lewis Aron, Ph.D., Director New York University Post Doctoral Program in Psychotherapy & Psychoanalysis
