        PRATT-John T. Born in Harlem, NY, in 1940, died on April 8, 1998 from complications, arising from lung cancer in Miami, FL. He is survived by his loving wife and partner of twenty-three years, Marie Adele Lee and his six children, John, James, Christine, Jerome, Joseph and Jermamine and foster son, Bernard Manson and his 12 grandchildren, Jelani, Ayana, Amina, Phillip, Nicholas, Sasha, Lauren, Imani, Ian, Sade, Andre and Kate. He is also survived by the extensive work he did for decades in community and human development in the Farragut/Fort Greene, South Bronx and Harlem communities in New York, institutionalizing bank community development outreach and financing prototypes in the midseventies, now in common use by banks across the nation as part of their Community Reinvestment Act compliance and part of ordinary community development practice. His work, for example, through the Chemical Bank Streetbanking program with community-based organizations in the South Bronx, such as the MidBronx Desperadoes, was one of the key foundation blocks for the development of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, a prominent, national community development intermediary. John retired after 28 years at Chemical Bank to Miami, Florida in 1991, but continued his community development work at a Miami-Dade community development corporation and after Hurricane Andrew, as director of an affordable single family housing initiative, capitalized in part by Allstate Insurance Company. John will be remembered by his wife and partner, children, colleagues and friends as a strong, vital man whose life was compelled by his integrity, vision and love for the other.
