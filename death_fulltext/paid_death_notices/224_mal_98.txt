        HAHN--Philip J. The employees of M. Fabrikant & Sons, Inc., mourn the loss of our Co-Chairman of the Board, Mr. Philip J. Hahn. Following his distinguished career in the Army during World War II, Mr. Hahn devoted himself to the growth and development of the firm to its status as the worldwide industry leader. He was a titan of the diamond industry who pioneered the early days of the markets in Tel Aviv, Mumbai, and Antwerp where he established manufacturing and trading offices for the firm. He was a positive presence in our New York office until his demise at the age of 89. We mourn his loss, and will miss his wit and wisdom. We extend our condolences to his family.
