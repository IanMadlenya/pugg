        LEWIS--Norman. Joined his beloved wife Eva on June 6, 2006. Devoted father to Susan and Joan, he was a family man above all else. He cherished his home on Candlewood Lake and spent his summer days playing tennis, sailing, swimming and planting Pachysandra. An accomplished athlete, Norman captained the United States fencing team at the 1948 London Olympic Games competing in both the individual and team Epee events. He won the U.S. Foil Championships in 1939 and was the U.S. National Epee champion in 1948, 1949 & 1950.
