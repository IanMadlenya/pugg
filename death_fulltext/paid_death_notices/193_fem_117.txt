        BORDEN-Adele (Addie) Segall. At age 74. Died after a long, courageous struggle with CLL. Beloved wife of the late Paul. She leaves her beloved children Joan, Gary and Neil, and six grandchildren, whom she deeply loves. She was a schoolteacher for many years at Great Neck South High School in the community in which she lived. She leaves many friends and colleagues, both longstanding and relatively new. To her dear friend, Harriet, there are no words to mention the enormous gratitude I and my family feel for your loving involvement.
