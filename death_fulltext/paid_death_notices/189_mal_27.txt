        CHAPIN-James B. WHY is deeply saddened by the passing of our friend and former Board Chairman, James Chapin, on Monday, September 30, 2002. Jim Chapin became a member of the board of WHY (World Hunger Year) at its founding in 1975, and served as Chair from 1980-2001, for 22 of its 27 years. Under his leadership, WHY rebounded from the death of its co-founder (and Jim's younger brother), Harry Chapin-and flourished. In his life, Jim Chapin has been an academician, an activist, a consultant, a politician, a government employee, and a journalist. But to us, he will always be known as ''The Chair.'' He will be greatly missed. WHY extends heartfelt sympathy to his wife, Diana, sons, Jim and David, his parents, brothers and sisters. Bill Ayres, Exec. Dir. WHY The WHY Board of Directors and Staff
