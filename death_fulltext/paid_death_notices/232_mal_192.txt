        SINGER--Paul. President and Chief Executive Officer of Paragon Honda, Paragon Acura, and White Plains Honda died quietly with his family at his side, on May 10, 2006, in Westchester, NY. Mr. Singer died from complications due to cancer; he was 72 years of age. As a devoted husband, father and grandfather he leaves behind a legacy of accomplishments and achievements earned with an unparallel combination of dignity, drive and respect for all of those around him. Mr. Singer was a Holocaust survivor, a veteran of the Korean War, an entrepreneur, a marathon runner, and a collector of antique automobiles; his son said appropriately, at his father's funeral service, ''My Father embodied the American Dream.'' His eloquent speech, his elegant touch, mixed with his iron willed determination earned him the nickname the ''silk hammer.'' Perhaps his greatest gift of all was his ability to cause ordinary people to conduct themselves in extraordinary ways, using encouragement, thoughtfulness, and selflessness as his tools. Mr Singer is survived by his wife Edith, two daughters, Michelle and Karen and his son Cory. Other surviving family members include his sisters Susan and Katherine, and his six grandchildren Anna, Lauren, Danielle, Julian, Isaac, and Samuel.
