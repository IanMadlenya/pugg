        HAMILTON - Sarah E. The Trustees, faculty, staff, and alumnae of the Nightingale-Bamford School mourn the loss of our beloved Miss Hamilton. She served with distinction from 1947 until her retirement in 1986 and was the Assistant Headmistress and head of the Physical Education Department. As the soul of our School, she helped guide generations of Nightingale girls and teachers. We will miss her wise counsel, her devotion to her girls and colleagues, and her infectious laugh and boundless sense of humor. We extend our heartfelt condolences to her friend and colleague, Miss Goode. Grant F. Winthrop, President Board of Trustees Joan S. McMenamin Headmistress Emerita Dorothy A. Hutcheson Head of School
