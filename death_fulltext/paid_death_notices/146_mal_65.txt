        SCHOENBACH-Sol. The Board, staff, faculty and students of the Settlement Music School of Philadelphia join with thousands of colleagues and students who mourn the passing of Sol Schoenbach. Named Executive Director Emeritus upon his retirement in 1981 after 24 years as Executive Director of the School, Dr. Schoenbach was a figure of international renown as a performer, educator, adminstrator, and thinker about the roll of music in the community and the power of musical study to transform lives. The School will host a memorial celebration of Dr. Schoenbach's life and accomplishments and those of his late wife, Bertha, a distinguished artist, in the late Spring of this year.
        SCHOENBACH-Sol. The Musicians, Trustees and Staff of the Marlboro Music School and Festival mourn the loss of a beloved friend and participant of fifteen years (1967-1982) and send heartfelt sympathy to his family. Sol's love of music and life was infectious, not only for his fellew woodwind colleagues but for all of us who were privileged to know him.
