        ROSS-Jesse. For some 70 years we lived, played and argued the world together. My parents and home were his as well, in the East Bronx. We struggled together against Franco's fascist hordes in Spain, Hitler's Holocaust in Nazi Germany and Stalin's murderous regime in Russia. We sought to build a new society based upon FDR's New Deal, LBJ's Great Society and Norman Thomas's struggles for human equality. Jesse, you were my oldest, dearest friend, but I have you no longer. Rest well. Bernard Bellush
