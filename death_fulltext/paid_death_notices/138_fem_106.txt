        CALKINS-Ann L. The Officers, Trustees and staff of the Asia Society note with profound sorrow the passing of our beloved colleague and friend, Ann Calkins. As Vice President for External Affairs for the past six years, Ann's professional dedication & personal commitment to the development of the Asia Society & the success of its mission brought her the admiration and respect of all who came in contact with her, in the United States and throughout Asia. Her ability to combine the highest professionalism with devotion to her family was a role model for all her colleagues, even as her courage & strength during her recent illness was an inspiration. She will be very much missed and lovingly remembered. To her husband, children and grandchildren, we offer our deepest sympathy. A memorial service will be held at the Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, on Thursday, July 23, at 3 PM. Maurice R. Greenberg, Chairman of the Board Nicholas Platt, President
