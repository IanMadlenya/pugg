        BLOCH--Charles B. The Cantors Assembly mourns the loss of one of its earliest members. Fondly remembered for his glorious voice and friendship to colleagues, Hazzan Bloch served four leading American congregations including Temple Ansche Chesed in Manhattan. His first cantorial experience was as chief alto soloist for the incomparable Yossel Rosenblatt. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Evelyn, children, Robert and Heni, and his many grandchildren. May Hazzan Bloch's memory remain as a blessing to all who were inspired by the beauty of his prayers, and touched by his goodness. Hazzan Steven Stoehr, President Hazzan Stephen J. Stein, Executive Vice President
