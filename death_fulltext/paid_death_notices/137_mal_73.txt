        YEZZO-Richard. The Board of Governors, members and staff of the Greater New York Hospital Association deeply regret the untimely and tragic passing of Richard Yezzo. His wonderful mix of humor and compassion will be sorely missed by everyone who had the pleasure of knowing him. He will be remembered as a dedicated leader in the healthcare community and as a strong advocate for compassionate, state-ofthe-art treatment for AIDS patients. We extend our most sincere condolences to his wife Phyllis, his children, and his many friends and loved ones. Mark J. Mundy, Chairman Kenneth E. Raske, President Greater NY Hospital Association
