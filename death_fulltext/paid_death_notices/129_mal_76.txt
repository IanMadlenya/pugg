        ALTSHULER-Bernard, Ph.D. The Trustees, Faculty and staff of NYU Medical Center deeply mourn the loss of Bernard Altshuler, age 78, Professor of Environmental Medicine at NYU School of Medicine. Dr. Altshuler was well known for his mathematical approach to biology and environmental health, particularly for mathematically predicting cancer risks. He joined the faculty at NYU School of Medicine's Institute for Environmental Medicine in 1951 and served NYU for 46 years until his death on October 4, 1997. In 1988, he wrote a book on the link between cigarette smoke and lung cancer. He also published extensive research in scientific journals on experimental models of cancer, health risk analysis and airborne carcinogens. Over the years, the U.S. Government asked Dr. Altshuler to advise several national commitees about environmental issues including air pollution, cancer, ozone and pesticides. His wife, Lillian Schulsinger Altshuler and children Jean and Miriam survive him. We express our deep sympathy to Dr. Altshuler's wife and family. E.
