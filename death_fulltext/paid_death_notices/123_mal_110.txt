A member of the Club since 1965, he served on the Club's Council and chaired its Modern Fine Printing Committee. As proprietor of the High Loft Press, he demonstrated superb skills as a printer and we are grateful for the lovely examples of his bookmaking which he donated to our library.l William B.
