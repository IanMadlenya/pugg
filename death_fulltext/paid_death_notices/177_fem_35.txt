        RUFF-Edith Brener. The Board, Council, and Staff of Planned Parenthood of New York City (PPNYC) mourn the death of Edie Ruff, a member of our Board of Directors for 31 years, and a member of our Council of Advocates for 7 years. Edie joined the PPNYC Board in the early 1960's and served with distinction on nearly every agency committee. She was an outstanding fundraiser and was, herself, a very generous supporter of our programs. We will long remember Edie for her unwavering commitment to this agency, and the health and rights of women in New York City. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to her entire family. Cathy A. Cramer Chair, Board of Directors Joan Malin, Chief Executive Officer
