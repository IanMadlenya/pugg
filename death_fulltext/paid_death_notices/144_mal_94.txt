        SPITZ-Dr. Arthur C. Beloved husband of Frances for 56 years. Much adored father of Darcy, and son-in-law Bob Yucikas. Lifelong companion of Jean and Harold Robbin. A son of Hungarian immigrants, he proudly served his country in the United States Army during World War II. A quiet man, he loved music, books, travel and his work as an optometrist. He will be deeply missed.
