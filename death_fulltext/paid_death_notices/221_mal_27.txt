        COLBURN--Richard D. Beauty is truth, truth beauty, that is all ye know on earth and all ye need to know. (Keats) Honoring the first anniversary of his death on June 3, 2004, A dominant figure on the stage of Classical Music, missed by his many friends all over the world. How sad we are to accept the misery of his dying hours at home, abandoned and alone, except for servants. We feel that God will surely reward him in the eternal Elysium of musical Heaven for his constant and generous devotion to the world of art and music. Dr. M. Lee Pearce Foundation, Inc.
