        ROSENBLOOM-Ben. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) express profound sorrow at the passing of Ben Rosenbloom of Baltimore, Maryland, a longtime dedicated supporter of the Technion along with his wife, Esther. As champions of the ATS, the Technion and Israel, the Rosenblooms attained Technion Guardian status, reaching the highest level of commitment. In addition to the Technion, they were stalwart supporters of many local Jewish community organizations. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his widow, his son Howard, a member of the ATS national board of directors and co-chairman of the Baltimore Chapter, and the entire Rosenbloom Family. American Society for TechnionIsrael Institute of Technology Evelyn Berger, President Lawrence S. Jackier, Chairman Melvyn H. Bloom, Exec. V.P. Fred Hittman, President, Baltimore Chapter Philip E. Klein, Co-Chairman of the Board, Baltimore Chapter
