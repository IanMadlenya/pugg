        LICHTENSTEIN-Roy, I had a friend, just the other day, my friend Roy, he died today. Where will you plot next? In New York City he passed away. Center of POP for you and me. I'll be there; will U2? In the city; glorious lights. Mondrian's Broadway; city delights. Have a cup of coffee; it's all I can offer, to a god of pop. A god of pop. D.G. Harth. 1245am 9-30-97.
