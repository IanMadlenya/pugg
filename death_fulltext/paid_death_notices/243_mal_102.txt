        CASLOW--Rubin. The employees of Acme Smoked Fish Corp. deeply mourn the loss of Rubin ''Ruby'' Caslow. Our deepest sympathies go to his widow, Charlotte, and the entire Caslow family. Ruby was a pioneer in the smoked seafood industry and led Acme from a small Brooklyn smoke house to the largest in the country. He always paid attention to both his personnel and the multiplicity of details of business. He was our teacher, his leadership and work ethic were an inspiration to all around him. We will all miss him.
