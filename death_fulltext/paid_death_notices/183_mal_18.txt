        HARKARVY - Benjamin. On March 30, 2002 at age 71. Loving brother of Jerry and Gloria Golden. Loving uncle of David, Nancy and Bill Golden. We will miss him dearly. A celebration of his life and work is planned for the spring.
        HARKARVY-Benjamin. The Juilliard Dance Division and all members of the School community mourn the death of Benjamin Harkarvy, faculty member since 1990 and artistic director of the Dance Division from 1992 to the present. With enormous creativity and dedication, Ben brought Juilliard dancers to new heights of accomplishment and imagination. His personal mentoring of hundreds of dancers throughout his entire career as a dancer, choreographer, administrator, and teacher have left a distinguished legacy that will be felt in the profession for many years to come. His wit, integrity, and personal grace will be deeply missed by all who knew him. Bruce Kovner, Chairman Joseph W. Polisi, President Stephen Clapp, Dean Faculty and Students of the Dance Division
        HARKARVY-Benjamin. Dear friend of many years. My sympathies go to his many friends, colleagues and especially his students, past and present. His love for you all renewed his strength each day. My sympathy especially to Jerry and Gloria, his brother and sister-in-law. Joan Traub
