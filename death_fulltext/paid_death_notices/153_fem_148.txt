        PHELAN-Sondra Sickles. The Marymount School Board of Trustees, administrators, faculty and the entire School community mourn the death of our beloved friend, teacher, colleague and trustee, Sondra Phelan. A valued member of the Board, Sondra shared with each of us her wise counsel, love of children and courageous spirit. We will miss her friendship, wit, wisdom and compassion. We extend our deepest sympathy to her husband, James; daughter, Melissa; sons, John, Daniel and Michael, six grandchildren, and her entire loving family.
