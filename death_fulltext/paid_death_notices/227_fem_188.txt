        KEENE - Constance. The House of Steinway & Sons deeply mourns the passing of the eminent American pianist Constance Keene, in New York City on December 24, 2005 at the age of 84. Constance Keene was a treasured member of our family of Steinway Artists for fiftytwo years. Early in her career she was proclaimed an exceptional interpreter of Rachmaninoff, and with her success in the Naumburg Competition of 1943 her career was launched. She appeared in recital, in duo recital with Abram Chasins, to whom she was married from 1949 until his death in 1987, and with the leading orchestras of the day. Ms. Keene was a featured participant in Steinway & Sons' Centennial concert at Carnegie Hall in 1953. An acclaimed teacher at the Manhattan School of Music, Ms. Keene was also an indefatigable traveler, serving on juries of the major piano competitions and conducting master classes around the globe. Our fond memories of Constance will continue to enrich us, as will her recordings and the artistry of her celebrated pupils. We convey our love and heartfelt condolences to her husband Milton. We have lost a dear friend. Bruce A. Stevens, President Peter B. Goodrich, V.P., Worldwide Concert and Artist Activities
