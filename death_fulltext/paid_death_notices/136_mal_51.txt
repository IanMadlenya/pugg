        RESNICK-Murray. Eugene M. Grant & Company, deeply mourns the death of our beloved colleague & friend, Murray Resnick. A highly skilled Real Estate management professional, a loyal and devoted employee for over three decades, who was above all a gentleman of the old school. He was cherished by his co-workers, his staff members, numerous tenants and vendors, all of whom appreciated his superior qualities. He will be sorely missed. We extend our deepest sympathy to his loving sons and daughters-in-law, and all of his caring grandchildren. Eugene M. Grant, President
