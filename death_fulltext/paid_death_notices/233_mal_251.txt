        $(6$)GRIBETZ--Allen, M.D., the Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine of the Mount Sinai Medical Center notes with great sorrow the untimely death of Dr. Allen Gribetz. Dr. Gribetz was a skilled, compassionate physician who was a valued supporter of our teaching and patient care programs. He was the first Fellow to graduate from the modern Pulmonary Division Program and one of the best. His quiet excellence was a mark of the joy he experienced in his work and the love of his wife, Jessica, and their four daughters. We are all in mourning.
