        LEVINE-Ada. Passed away 30 years ago on this date. Remembered with love and respect for her devotions to her husband, Leon, who predeceased her, to her children George and Claire, to their spouses, Shirley and the late Howard Silverman, and to her grandchildren, Shari (and husband Neil), Edward and Leonard. Her time with us was too short in years, but long in the positive impact that she had, and continues to have on our lives. We miss you Mom, but know that you and Daddy continue to watch over and guide us. Thank you for the legacy that, together, you left us.
