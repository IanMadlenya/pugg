        SALZMAN--Louis. Beloved husband of the late Sylvia. Loving father of Nancy and father-in-law of Les. He was to the very end funny, witty and charming, with all his intelligence intact. Former Director of the New York State Department of Vocational Rehabilitation. Thoughtful and helpful friend to many. He will be greatly missed by all including the ladies on the bench.
