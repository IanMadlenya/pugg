        BLUME--Sharon C. Died on January 6, 2005 in Norwalk, CT of cancer. She was a brilliant, witty and creative person who left an indelible mark on everyone who knew her. Survived by a bother, Cary Blume, two nephews, beloved aunt and uncle, Lillian and Philip Silver, cousins and a constellation of loving friends and admirers from Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York and points beyond. As Director of the Stamford Museum & Nature Center for the past five years, and in a similar capacity at other major institutions, she redefined the museum experience, and brought her sophisticated touch and unique vision to everything she did. Queen of popular culture, shopper extraordnaire, clever raconteur--and expert chef behind her Weber grill--we will never forget her. Burial in Rochester, NY. A memorial service mourning her passing and celebrating her life will be held at a later date. Contributions in her memory can be made to the Stamford Museum or the Susan Komen Breast Cancer Foundation.
