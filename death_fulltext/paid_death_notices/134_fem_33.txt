        STEINBERG-Beatrice (nee Dubin). Of Forest Hills, on March 3, 1998, at 74. Attorney, wife, mother, grandmother, sister, friend and advocate for children and women, she will be deeply missed by those she left behind-Samuel, beloved husband of fifty-five years; sons, Lawrence, Paul and Richard; nine grandchildren; and Sylvia Pezas, her only sister. In 1972 she graduated cum laude from Queens College, then worked as Special Assistant to the Secretary of the NYC Board of Education where she was the first woman to be promoted to Assistant Secretary to the Board and retired from that position in 1988. At sixty-four she completed a law degree at Brooklyn Law School, passed the New York State bar, and devoted her practice to representing the ill and incompetent who had no voice of their own. She supported and sustained us all with her love and care. Funeral Thursday, March 5, noon Schwartz Brothers, 114-03 Queens Boulevard.
