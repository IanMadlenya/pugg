        GOLUB-David. With tremendous sorrow, the Board of Directors, Artist Members and Staff of The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, mourn the sudden loss of our dear friend & colleague David Golub. An Artist Member since 1993 and an extraordinary pianist, conductor and musical interpreter, David brought his probing intellect and superb musicianship to countless brilliant and engaging performances as a solo pianist, chamber musician and conductor. He embraced the music of 4 centuries, while ardently championing the work of today's composers. Beyond the concert stage, he was a true Renaissance man, profoundly interested in the connectedness between art and life. David's depth of musical insight and great humanity inspired all who knew and loved him. He will be greatly missed. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife Maria, and his parents, Benjamin and Sima. Donaldson C. Pillsbury, Chairman Peter Frelinghuysen, President David Shifrin, Artistic Director Norma Hurlburt, Exec. Director
