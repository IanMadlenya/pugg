        BASHICK--Ann. On October 25, Ann was hit by a car, and on Friday, November 11, 2005 she died. I lost a very good, generous, caring friend who was full of enthusiasm and joie de vivre. A courageous woman who still had a lot to live for, Ann had a lot of friends who like me will miss her. I am near her sister Sarah and her family in this very sad moment. Goodbye Anna! Your Friend Marissa
