        WEISER--Joseph J. Knowing Joe Weiser, as our family has for half a century, was a joy, a pleasure, a privilege. He was wise, caring, good humored. Foremost in his life was his love of family. And as family patriarch, he embodied to others living example of his own high morals, sense of honor and integrity. His career achievements included accomplished attorney, dedicated public official and successful business professional. Our deepest sympathy to his beloved wife, Ruth, children, Stanley, Susan and Wendy and their families. We admired you, Joe, and we miss you. Merry Psaty Gilbert Jerrold Gilbert Michael C. Psaty
