        LEVY - Ayelet Haschachar. EMUNAH of America and Religious Zionists of America mourn the tragic murder of Ayelet Haschachar Levy, graduate of the EMUNAH College in Jerusalem. We mourn the loss of lives. Innocent victims of Palestinian barbarism. This time, it was family! Ayelet Haschachar Levy, a 28-year-old mother and talented artist was killed when a terrorist car bomb detonated Thursday afternoon in downtown Jerusalem. ''Ayelet HaSchachar'' means the 'first sparks of dawn' in Hebrew, but the young woman, whose future was just about to unfold, will never know another dawn. Our heartfelt condolences to her father, Rabbi Yitzhak Levy, Member of Knesset and Head of the National Religious Party, her mother, Chana, and her three-year-old daughter. The human toll, exacted by countless acts of brutality and cold-blooded terrorism, is escalating. We decry the callous disregard for human life, and the violence unleashed against Israel. May the Almighty console the Levy Family together with all mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Sylvia Schonfeld Chairman of the Board Marcia Genuth National President Rabbi Simcha Krauss National President, Religous Zionists of America
