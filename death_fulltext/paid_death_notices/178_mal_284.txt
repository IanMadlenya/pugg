        SAPERSTEIN-Harold, Rabbi. Congregation Rodeph Sholom notes with sorrow the passing of a giant in the rabbinate. Harold Sapperstein had a legendary career as Rabbi of Temple Emanuel in Lynbrook. Later, he served as Rabbi of our congregation in the painful transition period following the death of our beloved Rabbi Gunter Hirschberg in 1989. Rabbi Sapperstein did everything with passion, dignity, and class. He spoke with prophetic clarity, but embodied personal gentleness. He He will be profoundly missed. Condolences to his beloved family, his wife Marcia, son Marc, & son David, who served us as Rabbi, and all their dear ones. Robert N. Levine, Senior Rabbi Mark Biderman, President
