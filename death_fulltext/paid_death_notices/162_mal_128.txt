        ISRAEL-Rabbi Richard J. We record with profound sadness the passing of our beloved colleague. He had a distinguished career in Hillel, the campus rabbinate, as Associate Director at UCLA, as Director at Yale University, and from 1971-1985 as Executive Director of Hillel of Greater Boston. He instituted the Campus Rabbis Program at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College and until his death, served as acting Hillel Director at Brandeis University. He was the author of Jewish Identity Games: A How To Do It Book, The Kosher Pig and numerous essays. We express our deepest condolences to his wife, Sherry, children, Alisa, David, Rachel and Dr. Joshua and to all who were touched through his rabbinate. Rabbi Vernon H. Kurtz, Pres. Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Exec. VP The Rabbinical Assembly
