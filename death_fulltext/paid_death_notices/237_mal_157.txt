        $(6$)FARBER--Saul J., M.D. The Shaare Zedek Medical Center family offers its sincerest condolences to Rochelle Berkowitz on the loss of her beloved brother. His professional life was a living embodiment of the modern version of the Hippocratic Oath, to ''remember that there is an art to medicine as well as science'', ''not treat a fever chart...but a sick human...'' and provide care with ''warmth, sympathy and understanding''. Likewise, Rochelle and her husband Edward, through their generous support of the Dept. of Nuclear Medicine and the Delivery Room Complex, exemplify Dr. Farber's extraordinary legacy of healing the sick. May Rochelle and the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. American Committee for Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem
