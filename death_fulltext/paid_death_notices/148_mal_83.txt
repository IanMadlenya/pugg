        RENUCCI-Raymond. The French Institute Alliance Francaise mourns the loss of our beloved colleague and friend. A first class professor of French specializing in business, Mr. Renucci held an MBA degree from the Institut d' Etudes Politiques in Paris and a law degree from the Paris Law School. A caring teacher, he encouraged his students by his example and love of his native language. Mr. Renucci is survived by his son Pascal Gilles Renucci of CA and his family in France, among them his two brothers Antoine and Gerard and a sister Magdeleine Frizzi. A memorial to celebrate his life will be held in the French Institute's Tinker Auditorium located at 22 East 60th St. on Friday May 14, 1999 at 12:00 PM.
