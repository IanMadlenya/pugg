        PARRETT -- Marie. The Board and staff of Carnegie Hall note with sadness the passing of Marie Parrett, mother of our esteemed Board member William Parrett. Bill's ardent commitment to bettering this city and to a strong cultural inheritance among its citizens surely developed from his lifelong family ties in this city, and we mourn with Bill, Diane, and the extended family.
