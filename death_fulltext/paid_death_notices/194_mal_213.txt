        MORAN-Michael. Was born on November 29, 1950 in Dallas, Texas and died at his home in San Francisco, California on March 5, 2003. He was 52. Raised in Texas, he attended Dallas Jesuit Schools then moved to New York in 1968 to attend and graduate from Fordham University. He became immersed in the political, social, cultural and gay liberation climate of those times. His insights as a keen observer and his involvement with Andy Warhol 'Factory' were reflected in articles he wrote for Interview magazine. Michael lived in New York City and was a contributor to Interview Magazine until he moved to California in 1991. Of greatest importance to Michael were his many, loving friendships. Michael's keen understanding of human emotions and compassion for others allowed him to be a loving, caring sponsor for scores of men and women in the twelve-step community over a period of many years. Michael's generosities, kindness, love and laughter will be his legacy. May his soul rest in peace. Friends are invited to a visitation with the family, Thursday.
