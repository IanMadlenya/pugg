        STERN--Helen Burgher, 93, formerly of Norfolk, Virginia, died on December 11. Mrs. Stern, and her late husband, Old Dominion University Professor Robert L. Stern, were natives of Albany, NY who were stationed in Norfolk during WWII. The Sterns became prominent civic and community activists in the adopted hometown they both came to love. They were among the courageous founding members of The Norfolk Committee for Public Schools in 1958, which fought to reopen Virginia's public schools after the governor closed them rather than desegregate. Mrs. Stern will also be remembered as a founder of the Town-N-Gown organization which brought together university, military and civilian leaders. Mrs. Stern was an alumna of SUNY-Albany and Syracuse University Graduate School. She is survived by her daughters Susan Stern Gemberling of NYC and Esther Barnet Stern of The Netherlands; her son and his wife: Richard Stern and Terri MulQueenyStern of Chappaqua, NY; her granddaughter and grandson-in-law: Sarah Stern and Rene S. Leon of Ossining, NY; and her grandsons; John Gemberling of New York City and Robert, Joseph and Daniel Stern of Chappaqua, NY. Private funeral services will be held on Wednesday, December 15 in Albany, NY. Donations in her memory may be made to the Arthritis Foundation, P.O. Box 96280, Washington DC or the Robert L. Stern Fund, Old Dominion University, 129 Koch Hall, Norfolk, VA. 23529.
