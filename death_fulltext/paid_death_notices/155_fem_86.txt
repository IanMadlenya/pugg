        MONNESS-Billie Heller. Words cannot convey the richness of the life of Billie Heller Monness, which ended peacefully on December 8, 1999. Breast cancer could never diminish the passion and joy with which she lived. After building a successful advertising and public relations firm in Winter Park, Florida, she moved to New York City to become Deputy Director of Communications of the Museum of the City of New York. But always at the center of her thoughts and energies was her large and complex family, which she anchored and adored: her husband and true partner in life, Andrew Monness; her mother, Shirley Rubenstein; her children, Jennifer Heller Monness and Peter Christoper Heller; her step-son, Matthew Monness; her grandchildren, Jack and Henry Monness; her sister Laura Johnson; and a circle of friends and extended family members the number of which astounds, but each of whom she loved and was loved by her. Courage was second nature as were wisdom, beauty and grace. She taught us how to live and die. Services Thursday 12:30 PM, at ''The Riverside'', 76 Street and Amsterdam Avenue
