        MARTINEZ-Enrique. The Board of Governing Trustees, dancers, and staff of American Ballet Theatre mourns the passing of our dear friend and colleague, Enrique Martinez. Enrique joined ABT as a dancer in 1947 and later enjoyed a 33 year career with the Company as Ballet Master, Regisseur, and finally, Assistant Director. His extraordinary talent, effortless grace, and boundless good humor enriched our lives and guided our art. We shall miss him greatly.
