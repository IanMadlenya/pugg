        MORSE--Anne Mendelsohn, 93. In memory of our dear mother, who passed away a year ago, on February 20, 2005. A long-time Brooklyn resident, she and husband Julius (1999) are missed by their many friends, neighbors, and fellow folk-dancing enthusiasts. Anne was a self-taught artist, a voracious reader, and a kind and supportive parent. She loved music, art, and especially dance. She enjoyed word games, travel, and the society of like-minded friends. She is survived by her sister Miriam Begg Maddux, son Robert, daughter Linda Heller, and grandchildren Clifford, Victoria, Russell and Brandice Heller, and Nicola & Murray Pearson. We are all grateful for the many years we were able to share with her
