        HOWE--Geoffrey R.The faculty, staff, students and alumni of the Mailman School of Public Health of Columbia University mourn the passing of Professor Geoffrey R. Howe, PhD distinguished leader in the field of epidemiology, on August 31st. Former Chair and Gelman Professor, Department of Epidemiology, he was internationally renowned in the areas of cancer and the environment, and nutrition. Despite the challenge of his blindness, he was one of the world's foremost radiation epidemiologists, whose investigations of cancer incidence among atomic bomb survivors helped change the fundamental assumptions about radiation risk and led to his selection by the National Cancer Institute to head research on the cancer effects of the Chernobyl accident. A gifted mathematician and prolific scientist, Dr. Howe was also among the leading scholars on the effects of diet on cancer. Esteemed teacher, mentor, and advisor to many, his dedication to countless students is unsurpassed. He will be sorely missed, and we extend our deepest sympathy to his wife and family.
