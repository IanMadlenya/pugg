        DANZIGER-Fred. M.D. The Faculty and Staff of NYU School of Medicine mourn the passing of Fred Danziger, M.D., Associate Professor of Clinical Anesthesiology. Having joined the School's staff in 1975, he earned respect and admiration from his colleagues, students and patients for his clinical and academic expertise and for his humanity. He retired in 1994. From 1975-94 Dr. Danziger also served as Medical Director of the Ambulatory Surgery Unit at Tisch Hospital. While he was highly regarded for his wide ranging knowledge in his field, he will be most strongly remembered for his commitment to pediatric anesthesiology. While his loss will be felt throughout the NYU community, his contributions will be enormously appreciated well into the future. Robert M. Glickman, MD, Dean NYU School of Medicine Herman Turndorf, MD, Professor and Chairman Department of Anesthesiology, NYU School of Medicine
