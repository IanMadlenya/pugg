        HAYES-Sadler. The DillerQuaile School of Music mourns the passing of our friend Sadler Hayes, who founded the School's first outreach program in 1973, because he believed teaching mussic to young children would help them learn to read; tirelessly, he fund-raised for the program each succeeding year. Thanks to Sadler, The Summer Music Study Program, co-sponsored by Brick Church, has enabled thousands of children in Harlem and East Harlem to experience the language of music through song and dance. We salute his unquenchable interest in people, and his great love of music. Our heartfelt condolences go out to his devoted wife Agnes, and to his entire family. The Board, Faculty and Staff of The Diller-Quaile School of Music
