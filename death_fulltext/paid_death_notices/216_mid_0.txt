        CRIMI--Patricia. The North Shore-Long Island Jewish (LIJ) Health System is saddened by the death of Patricia Crimi, a part of the health system's family for 40 years. Mrs. Crimi's father, Robert B. Wheelen, was one of the founders of North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, NY. Her husband Michael became a hospital trustee in 1966 and served as president of the Board of Trustees in 1977. He continues to serve as a life trustee of the health system. We are extremely grateful to the family for its long commitment to North Shore-LIJ, and extend our condolences to Michael and all of Mrs. Crimi's family and friends. Dan de Roulet Chairman Michael J.
