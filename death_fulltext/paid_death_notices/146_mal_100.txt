        RUDORFER-Seymour. Precious husband to Anita, loving father to Linda and Steve, Janet and Sam, Henry and Dara. Devoted grandfather of Adam, Deena, Max, Ian, Samantha, and Joey. Loyal brother of Alvin, Edith, and the late Gloria and Morris Kaplan. A man whose smile and heart were as big as he was. He fought valiantly against lung cancer. His life and fight stand as an example to everyone. His touch extended from his immediate family to his friends and his long list of associates. His generosity knew no bounds. Seymour's leadership was spirited and inspiring. His legacy is in his philanthopic deeds. He is truly a hard act to follow and will be sorely missed. In lieu of flowers, please make donations in his name to The UJA Federation. Funeral services on Wednesday, March 3rd, at 12:00 noon at Temple Judea, Manhasset, New York.
