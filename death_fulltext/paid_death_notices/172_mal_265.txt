        MICHEL-Henry L. The Board of Directors, officers and staff of Parsons Brinckerhoff mourn the passing of Henry L. Michel, former president and chairman of Parsons Brinckerhoff Inc. Henry's 50 year career as a civil engineer and manager earned him an international reputation as a leader and innovator. He directed the firm's engineering services on some of the most significant transportation projects of the 20th century. Henry joined Parsons Brinckerhoff in 1965. He served as president and chief executive officer from 1979 to 1990 and as chairman from 1990 to 1994. Henry was a member of the National Academy of Engineering and an Honorary Member of the American Society of Civil Engineers. He was honored by the American Consulting Engineers Council with the organization's highest individual honor, the Distinguished Award of Merit, in 1997. He was a founding member of the Civil Engineering Research Foundation, a research organization of ASCE. His alma mater, Columbia University, honored Henry with the Alumni Federation Medal, the highest honor given to alumni, in 1991, and with the Egleston Medal for Distinguished Engineering Achievement in 1982. He was a senior lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Industry Professor of Construction Management at Polytechnic University of Brooklyn, New York. We extend our sympathies to Henry's wife, Mary Elizabeth, of NYC and his daughters, Eve Michel and Ann Elizabeth Wilde, and granddaughter, Ava Elizabeth Milanese. A memorial service will be held at a future date. Thomas J. O'Neill, President & CEO Robert Prieto, Chairman of the Bd Parsons Brinckerhoff
