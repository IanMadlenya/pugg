        CERVINO-Carmen. Extraordinary men visit upon us the glowing legacy of extraordinary lives. To the table of Daytop's awesome responsibilities for young lives, Carmen Cervino for over a quarter century bought his immense portfolio of financial and management skills. This became his 'labor of love' offering hope and strength to this Town's troubled youth. A loving God has laid claim upon a life extraordinarily lived. Our prayerful support for his beloved Enid and family. Monsignor William B. O'Brien President Daytop Village Foundation, Inc.
