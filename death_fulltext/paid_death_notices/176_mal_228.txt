        HABER-Max. American Friends of The Hebrew University is deeply saddened by the passing of our dear Council of Trustees member, Chicago Chapter Board Member and Benefactor Max Haber. Having no family of their own, Max and his wife Rita decided to make The Hebrew University of Jerusalem their ''child''. Many of the programs at the University have benefited from their generosity, and Max was a member of the Hebrew University Board of Governors. As Max was a Russian concentration camp survivor, of particular importance to him and Rita were the Max & Rita Haber Division of Holocaust Studies and The Max & Rita Haber Chair in Contemporary Jewish History. They also created The Dr. Siegfried Haber Chair in Medicine in memory of Max's brother. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife Rita and the entire family. American Friends of The Hebrew University Ira Lee Sorkin, President Keith L. Sachs, Chairman of the Board Adam B. Kahan, Executive Vice President
