        SOONG--Fu-Yuan. The Board of Directors and Staff of the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation mourn the death of Soong on December 5, 2005. A gifted composer of chamber music, opera and symphonic work, Soong's pieces have been performed in halls throughout the United States including Lincoln Center, the Kennedy Center and Carnegie Hall. His work has also been performed across Europe and Asia. During the past year, his compositions for piano were performed on a world tour by renowned pianist Fou-Ts'ong. Soong is survived by his wife and life companion, Darcy Helen Hector, a long time program officer at the Clark Foundation. He is also survived by their son, Corey Ming-Sheng Soong. We will miss Soong, are saddened by his passing and offer our heartfelt sympathy to Darcy and Corey at this difficult time.
