        TIERNEY--Dr. Loren. The Department of Family Medicine of Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center expresses its deepest sympathy to our Residency Director, Dr. Jim Mumford, on the passing of his beloved wife, Dr. Loren Tierney. We will always remember Loren's unbounded devotion to her family; her warmth, wit and generosity; and her strength, courage and grace as she battled her illness. We extend our embrace to Jamie, Cooper, Anna, and the rest of Loren's family as they absorb this incalculable loss.
