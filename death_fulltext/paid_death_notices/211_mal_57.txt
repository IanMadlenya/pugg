        FIORILLO--Albert L., Jr. of New York City on August 4, 2004, after a long illness. A respected conductor. A kind human being. He enriched the lives of so many Americans by bringing classic Broadway musicals to all America for more than 30 years. As music director and conductor of the Papermill Playhouse, NJ for almost a decade, as conductor of the national companies of ''My Fair Lady'', ''A Chorus Line'', and countless other Broadway classics, Albert was truly a part of musical America. The devoted son of the late Judge Albert and Bertha Fiorillo, loving brother of Alberta and Frances, brothers-in-law Edmund and Ed; adoring uncle of Amy, Judith, and Laurie; proud granduncle of Ava, Charlotte, Henry and Augustus; and dear friend of Alphonse, John, Lynne, Marcia, and Susan. The funeral will be private. A memorial gathering to honor Albert will be announced shortly.
