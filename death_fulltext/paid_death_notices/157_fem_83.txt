        PASQUALE-Margaret. The New York County District Attorney's Office notes with profound sadness the death of Assistant District Attorney Margaret Pasquale. Maggi was a valued member of the legal staff for 13 years who served as Deputy Bureau Chief of the Family Violence and Child Abuse Bureau. We will miss her kindness, her friendship, and her wise counsel. Her abilities as a trial lawyer and her compassion for victims and witnesses were unparalleled. Our heartfelt condolences to her husband, Kevin Berry, and their two young children, Kevin and Bridget. Robert M. Morgenthau, District Attorney of New York County
