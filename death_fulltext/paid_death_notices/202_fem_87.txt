        DAWSON--Brigid. The faculty, staff, and students of the English/Speech and ELI Departments of New York Institute of Technology, Manhattan Campus, mourn the sudden and devastating loss of our beloved friend, colleague, and teacher. We extend our deepest condolences to her family and friends. She gave us her wisdom, humor, passion for life, and intelligence. Our international students benefited from her extraordinary skills and generosity; our faculty and staff delighted in her wit and humanity. No eye was more perceptive, no mind more sensible, no heart more responsive. Brigid, we miss you dreadfully. Thank you for sharing some of your life with us.
