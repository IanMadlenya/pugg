        BAYER--Joella, died February 18, 2004, in Montecito, California aged 96. She was born Joella Synara Haweis in Bagni di Lucca, Italy, July 20, 1907, of British parents; her father was a painter and her mother, Mina Loy, a noted poet. The family lived in Florence until 1923 when she, her mother and her sister moved to Paris. There she met and, in 1927, married Julien Levy. They moved to New York that same year where they started, in 1931, the pioneering Julien Levy Gallery, showing contemporary photography, the Surrealists and later, the Neo-Romantics. After her divorce in 1942, she met and married in 1944 the Bauhaus painter, designer and architect Herbert Bayer. In 1946, they moved to Aspen, Colorado, where they were both closely involved with the development of Aspen as a ski resort and a cultural center. The Bayers moved to Montecito, California in 1974. After Bayer's death in 1985 she stayed on in Montecito, continuing to play an active part in the art world as she had done since her youth and managing the Bayer estate, the bulk of which she donated to the Denver Art Museum. She was devoted to, and actively furthered, the careers of both her husbands. A famed beauty, she was witty, intelligent, forthright and tremendously generous. She is survived by her son Jonathan, 2 daughters-in-law, Britt Bayer and Marie Levy, and numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
