        MEANY--John. The head mistress, trustees, faculty and staff, students, parents and alumnae of Convent of the Sacred Heart, NYC, deeply mourn the passing of an exceptional friend. The Sacred Heart community will cherish the memory of John's loving spirit and that of his daughter Lauren. We keep his wife, Barbaree, and his entire family in our thoughts and prayers during this difficult time.
