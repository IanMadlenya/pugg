        GROSS--Susannah D., devoted mother of Seth and Stephanie Andrew, spent her life serving others. A memorial on Friday at 2pm will be held at Plaza Jewish Chapel with Shiva at 2pm on Sunday at 875 WEA. In lieu of flowers, donations to the Democracy Prep Social Work Fund will memorialize her commitment to those in need.
