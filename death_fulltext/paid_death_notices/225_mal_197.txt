        JOSEPHY--Alvin M., Jr. It is with deep sadness that the Horace Mann School notes the passing of Alvin M. Josephy, Jr., Class of 1932. A long-standing friend of the School, he was a socially committed man of exemplary intellect, integrity and vision. In 1996 the Horace Mann Alumni Association presented him with its ''1996 Award for Distinguished Achievement'' as one of the nation's foremost authorities on the American Indian. We extend our deepest sympathy to his children, Diane, Allison, Katherine, Alvin M. III, to his brother, Warren, and to the rest of his family. Mr. Josephy's remarkable presence and passion for life will be remembered. Dr. Thomas M. Kelly Head of School Robert J. Katz '65 Chair, Board of Trustees
