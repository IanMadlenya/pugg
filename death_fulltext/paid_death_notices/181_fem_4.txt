        MORATH-Inge. The entire Leica community mourns the loss of Inge Morath who, for more than a half century, was one of the brightest stars in the constellation of the world's master photographers. Her brilliant spirit will forever remain reflected in her timeless images. Inge was a very special woman and was our privilege to have known her. Roger Horn, President, Leica Camera, Inc.
