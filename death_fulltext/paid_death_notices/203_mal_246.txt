        NYIRI--Peter Victor. Suddenly, at age 56. Beloved husband of Betty Gerendasy, son of the late Magda and Joska Nyiri. Peter was born in Budapest, lived in Israel until age 12 when his family came to New York. Peter graduated from Bronx High School of Science, City College and Hebrew University. He was an insurance underwriter for many years and recently formed the Beneer Associates Company. Peter was a charming, extraordinary man, kind and generous with a big heart and a great love of life. He survived a major stroke three years ago and, despite his disability, looked forward eagerly to living life as fully as possible. His family and his countless friends will miss him terribly.
