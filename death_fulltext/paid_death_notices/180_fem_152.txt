        GREENBAUM-Pauline, 102. January 12, 2002. We mourn the loss of our beloved Aunt Paulie, whose life was spent in service to God and her fellow human beings. Her vibrant optimism and joyous personality will be an inspiration to us all. Gloria, Mindy, Jean, and her many adoring nieces and nephews
