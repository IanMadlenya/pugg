        FAMIGHETTI-Joseph P. The Partners, Attorneys, and Staff of Certilman Balin Adler & Hyman, LLP are deeply saddened by the passing of our dear friend and valued partner, Joseph Famighetti. Joe was a highly-regarded expert in the field of Criminal Law. He brought years of law enforcement experience to his practice, having served as a Long Island Parkway Police Officer, Detective, and Nassau County Assistant District Attorney. Joe served as Counsel to two New York State Senators and was a member of the Nassau County Civil Service Commission and the Long Island Regional Planning Board. We are grateful for his legal guidance and dedication he provided during his service to our firm. He will be truly missed by all of the people whose lives he touched with his compassion, dependability, and friendship. To his beloved wife, Janice, his adoring children, Peter, Christine and sonin-law Joseph Marshiano, and his loving grandchildren, Jenna and Christopher, we offer our heartfelt sympathies.
