        LAUMONT-Sophie. The students, faculty, administrators and Trustees of the Spence School mourn the death of Sophie Laumont, our beloved classmate, student and friend. We cherish our memories of her deep intelligence, her passion for learning, and her extraordinary courage. She revealed in every moment we spent with her a unique wisdom and vitality, and a voice gently, but persistently, present in its determined grace. We extend our heartfelt condolences to her parents, Anne and Philippe Laumont, her sisters, Julie and Laura, and other members of her family. We will remember Sophie always.
