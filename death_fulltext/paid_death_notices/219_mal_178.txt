        PUTTERMAN -- S. Robert. Died peacefully on April 15, 2005, one month shy of his 100th birthday. Devoted husband of Leonore. Beloved father of Eric (Debby). Cherished grandfather of Alexander and Allison. He was an attorney for the Men's Clothing Unions of New York City and was instrumental in the establishment of the Village of Atlantic Beach, where he served as Attorney and Public Works Commissioner for many years. A strong, silent type, his clever wit and classic style will be missed by family and friends.
