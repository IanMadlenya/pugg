        LAQUERCIA -- Evelyn M. (nee Fernandez). Of Brooklyn, NY, on May 29, 2005. Born in Oviedo, Spain, on November 2, 1943, beloved wife of Thomas Michael Laquercia, loving mother of Thomas Peter, Marc Anthony and Justin Gregory, devoted sister, caring and cherished aunt. Evelyn arrived in America on April 22, 1946, with her parents and sister, on the very first birthday of the man she would later marry. She attended Notre Dame School in Manhattan and was graduated from Hunter College with a degree in Economics. She began her career with Federated Department Stores as an assistant buyer and retired from business to raise her family. Twenty-one years ago, Evelyn was stricken with multiple sclerosis but lived a courageous life both as wife and mother, actively participating in her sons' moral formation and education that extended to bachelor degrees for each and a J.D. from Fordham Law School as well for Marc. Though limited to a wheel chair for a dozen years, she was filled with exuberance and the joy of life without complaint till the very end. She will be sorely missed by her family, neighbors and friends. A true fighter to the very end. Mass at Sacred Hearts St. Stephen, Friday, 9:30 A.M. In repose Raccuglia & Son, 321-323 Court Street, Brooklyn, 718-855-7737.
