        KIRCHNER-Merian. On September 25, 1997. We cherish the memory of a gentle and courageous lady who enriched the lives of all who knew her, including her late and beloved husband, Engelbert, his family, her nieces and nephew, and her extended family of friends. That family grew to embrace readers of the ''Betsy-Tacy'' books written by Merian's mother, Maud Hart Lovelace, which originated as bedtime stories for her daughter. A gifted writer herself, Merian of the lively mind, tender heart and indomitable spirit will be missed but not forgotten.
