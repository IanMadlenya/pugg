        WITENBERG-Earl, M.D. The William Alanson White Psychoanalytic Society of the William Alanson White Institute pays tribute to one of the Society's former presidents and the longest serving director of the Institute. Also an admired teacher, analyst and supervisor to several generations, Dr. Wittenberg essentially devoted his professional life through these various roles to furthering the missions, first of the Society and later of the Institute. He unstintingly shared with us his deep belief in the Interpersonal tradition, his passionate opinions and his tireless leadership. We continue with his legacy and send heartfelt condolences to his devoted and beloved wife, Carol Eagle, Ph.D., and all others near and dear to this remarkable man. Margit Winckler, Ph.D President, The White Society
