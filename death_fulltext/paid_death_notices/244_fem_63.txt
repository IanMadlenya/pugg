        LAWTON--Nancy. Noted artist Nancy Lawton died in Albany, NY, on May 5th, 2007, after a courageous five-year battle with cancer. She was 57 years old. Ms. Lawton studied art at California State University at San Jose, and received her MFA at the Massachusetts College of Art, Boston, in 1980. Graphite and silverpoint drawings were her milieu. In 1982 Ms. Lawton's drawings caught the attention of Gene Baro, curator at the Brooklyn Museum, and the following year Baro organized a solo retrospective of her drawings at the Museum and purchased eight for its collection. Today, Ms. Lawton's drawings also reside in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, and the Albany Institute of History and Art. She has been represented by Hirschl & Adler Modern, New York, since 2001. Ms. Lawton is survived by her husband, Dr. Richard Enemark, Headmaster of the Doane Stuart School in Albany; her two children, Faith and Forrest; her father, Edward Lawton, of Santa Clara, CA; and her sister, Carol Lawton, of Fremont, CA. A memorial service will be held at a future date. The family requests that donations in Ms. Lawton's memory be made to the American Cancer Society or the Campaign for the Doane Stuart School, in lieu of flowers.
