        MONAS - Pauline Levy. The trustees and staff of the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services mourn the passing of Pauline Levy Monas, the beloved mother of Martin Monas, the JBFCS board member whose generosity established Levy-Monas House on Long Island. Mrs. Monas played a role in creating and supporting Levy-Monas House, an adolescent-group home named for her parents and in-laws. She also created the tradition of philanthropy carried on by her son and other members of her family. Funeral services for Mrs. Monas will be held Thursday, November 11, at noon at the Norman L. Jeffer Community Chapel, 4620 Fort Hamilton Parkway in Brooklyn. The family will sit shiva at the home of Martin Monas in Manhattan. We express our deepest sympathy to her son, Martin; her daughter, Barbara Herman; her sisters, Frieda Spiegel and Edna Ginsberg; her brother, Abe Levy; her grandchildren, Shari and Lowell Frey and Barry Herman; and her great-grandchildren, Allison and Sam Frey. Joseph S. Kaplan, President Seymour R. Askin, Jr., Chairman of the Board Alan B.
