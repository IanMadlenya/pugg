        KNOWLTON-Abbie Ingalls, M.D. The Department of Medicine at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University notes with deep sorrow the death of Dr. Abbie Ingalls Knowlton, Clinical Professor of Medicine, whose association with and contributions to our Department extend back nearly 60 years. An alumna of Bryn Mawr College in 1938, a graduate of the College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1942 and a subsequent member of the Medical House Staff of The Presbyterian Hospital (including having been its first woman Chief Resident), Dr. Knowlton gave her entire professional life to unstinting, generous and gracious service to generations of patients, medical students and house staff. Quite apart from her distinguished contributions to a basic understanding of adrenal gland physiology and the early management of patients with Addison's disease which were formerly recognized in her election to membership in The American Society for Clinical Investigation, Dr. Knowlton served as an incomparable role model for all those fortunate to be associated with her. Wise, vigilant, faithful and tender in her care of patients, she taught by quiet but telling example what it is to be a physician and friend. To the end, despite a long and trying personal illness, she set a standard for others in her continuing care for patients, her kindness, her quick and perceptive interest in others and her unflagging courage and good spirits. She was a gallant, unfailingly gracious and universally beloved teacher and colleague whose passing leaves an aching void and who is greatly mourned. We extend our deepest sympathy to her husband, Dr. Kenneth Calder, to her son, Thomas Calder and to her daughter, Mary Calder Johnstone. Myron L. Weisfeldt, M.D. Chairman, Department of Medicine College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University
