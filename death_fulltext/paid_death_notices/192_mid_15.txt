        GRANAT-Ruth. We extend heartfelt condolences to Leslie Granat, Jill Handelsman and Bernard Belkin on the loss of their beloved mother and his sister. Ruthie's entire life, together with her late husband Stanley, was devoted to generously supporting acts of kindness. As a Benefactor of the Medical Center, Founder and past President of our Palm Beach, Florida committee, and a member of the International Board of Governors, her friendship, leadership and enthusiasm, was legendary. May Leslie, Jill, Bernard and the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. American Committee for Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem
