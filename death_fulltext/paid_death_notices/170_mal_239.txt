        de SOLA-MORALES-Ignasi. The Museum of Modern Art notes with sadness the death of Ignasi de Sola-Morales. From 1978-1986 Mr. de Sola-Morales worked very closely with the Museum's Department of Architecture and Design on the reconstruction of Mies van der Rohe's 1929 German Pavilion in the city of Barcelona. He was a widely respected architect, critic and teacher and his contributions to architecture will be long remembered. Ronald S. Lauder, Chairman Agnes Gund, President Glenn D. Lowry, Director Terrence Riley, Chief Curator of Architecture and Design The Museum of Modern Art, NY
