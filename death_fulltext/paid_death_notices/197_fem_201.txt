        FRIEND--Eleanor B. On midafternoon, June 23, 2003, Ellie Friend was taken from us. She was dearly loved. She didn't know a stranger. Ellie cared for everyone she knew, everyone she met and everyone she could help in whatever way was possible. She was a wonderful wife, a wonderful friend, a wonderful sister who gave in any way she could. She loved people, she loved travel, she loved other people's love and she wanted to give to anyone in need in any way possible. Her gift of caring, her warm and tender words for grown ups, for children, for animals, for people of all walks of life made her a true disciple of all that is good within our special place under the sun. Whatever you wanted, whatever you needed, whatever you cared about was what Ellie wanted, needed and cared about because she was wanting you to be happy. Her special place ...and the way she was...made the world a better world for having enjoyed holding her in its arms. God bless her soul and keep her nourished as an example for all who follow her treasured life on this earth. A Memorial Service will be held at 12:00 noon on Monday, June 30th at the Danzansky - Goldberg Me morial Chapels, 1170 Rockville Pike in Rockville, MD. In lieu of flowers, please send contributions in memory of Eleanor Friend to the American Cancer Society-Pancreatic Cancer Research, 1875 Connecticut Ave, NW, Ste 730, Washington, DC 20009. >>AD#
