        GORALNIK-Israel. The Officers, Boards of Directors and staff of American ORT and Women's American ORT deeply mourn the passing of Israel Goralnik, former Director-General of ORT Israel. During his tenure he contributed enormously to the development of vocational education in Israel, creating opportunities for needy students and developing new technologies. A visionary leader, he was the first recipient of the American ORT ''Yitzhak Rabin Award.'' Goralnik, who was wounded in the War of Independence, was Director-General of Israel's Ministry of Labor, and devoted himself to the education and training of Israel's youth. Our heartfelt sympathy goes out to his family. Robert L. Sill, President Joe Cohen, First V.P. Paul B. Firstenberg, Executive Director, American ORT Carol Linch, President Judy Menikoff, First V.P. Alice Herman, Executive V.P., Women's American ORT
