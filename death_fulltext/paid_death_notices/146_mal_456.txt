        BRYER-Morton S., M.D. The Mount Sinai Alumni express profound sorrow at the loss of our esteemed colleague and friend. A member of Mount Sinai's staff for over forty years, Dr. Bryer distinguished himself not only in the practice of medicine, but in service to his country. The recipient of both the Bronze and Silver Star, he was the Alumni's most highly decorated serviceman during W.W. II. He will be missed. Our deepest condolences are extended to his family. Wayne S. Fuchs, M.D., President Avi Barbash, M.D., Vice Pres. Maria Padilla, M.D., Secretary William G. Stein, Treasurer
