        SCHAEFER-Helene Hollis. The Manhattanville College community mourns the loss of alumna Helene Hollis Schaefer, '89. We are proud to be the Institution where she earned her well-deserved Master of Arts in Liberal Studies degree at the age of 90. Her zeal for learning was an inspiration to our students and faculty.
