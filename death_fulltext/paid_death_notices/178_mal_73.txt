        WEISS-Abraham. The members, officers, and staff of the former District 1115/SEIU deeply regret the passing of our friend and mentor, Abraham Weiss. ''Abe'' served our Union for five decades. He opened our minds through education, inspiration and humor so that we could imagine who we could be. We will never forget him. Our condolences to Abe's beloved wife Ruth and their family. Jay Sackman Executive Vice President 1199SEIU
