        HALPERN-Edith. The Board of Trustees of the Central Park Conservancy is deeply saddened by the passing of Edith Halpern. We extend our heartfelt condolences to her husband Nathan, a Life Trustee of the Central Park Conservancy, and the entire Halpern family. Since the founding days of the Conservancy more than two decades ago, the Halperns have been generous with their support and counsel. Their contributions to Central Park will benefit visitors for generations to come. A.J.C. Smith, Chairman Regina S. Peruggi, President The Board of Trustees, Central Park Conservancy
