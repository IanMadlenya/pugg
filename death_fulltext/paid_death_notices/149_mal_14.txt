        SHERL-Bernard. On May 30, 1999. Beloved and devoted husband of the late Mildred Bernstein. Dearest father of Jane Rosenblum (Michael) and Robert. Loving grandfather of Gregory and Rebecca. Brother of the late Ely Scherl. A graduate of City College and Brooklyn Law School, he worked for the I.R.S. and subsequently went into private practice and became a prominent tax attorney. He overcame many obstacles to achieve the respect of his peers and the love of his family. He chaired many tax study groups, was an acting Village Justice in Lake Success, New York, was an avid golfer, a voracious reader and had a constitution which would not give up in the face of adversity. Courageous and proud to the end, he will be sorely missed.
