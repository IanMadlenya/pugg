        NEWTON--Helmut. It was an honor to have met Helmut Newton and a true privilege to have shared wonderful moments with him. His photographic work was only part of his greatness; he was kind, funny, a true genius. Helmut will be long missed and forever remembered. We remember him with much love and admiration.
