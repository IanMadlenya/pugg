        BANNER-Sy. Four Winds mourns the loss of Sy Banner, a superb hospital administrator, outstanding corporate Vice President and warm, caring personal friend to all of us. Sy stood for the best in health care. We offer our profound sympathies to his wife Dorothy, their children and the family. In his memory we are naming our administration building where he worked for so many years ''The Banner Building.'' Sy, you will be deeply missed. Samuel C. Klagsbrun, M.D. Four Winds Hospital
