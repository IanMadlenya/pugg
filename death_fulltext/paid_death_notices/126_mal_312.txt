        TRIPP-Hon. Samuel S. Age 94, Counsel to our law firm for the past 24 years since mandatory retirement as Chief Law Assistant and Official Referee to the Queens County Supreme Court. Sam set an example of devotion to the law and unquenchable intellectual curiosity which in his memory we will seek to emulate. Immigrant from Austria in 1909, graduate with honors (in oratory) from Stuyvesant High School, from City College and from NYU Law School, author of the paradigm text on Motion Practice in New York, member of the Law Revision Commission on the CPLR, bar leader for decades, President of the Queens County Bar Association in 1951, and honoree in March of this year at the Nassau County Bar Association when we dedicated the LaLiberte Banner in his honor, Sam will live on as an inspiration to young lawyers-an expert strategist, a forceful advocate, a tireless teacher, a scrupulous draftsman and a wise counsellor. We have learned from him; we have loved him; we will miss him. The Partners, Associates, Counsel and Staff of, Farrell, Fritz, Caemmerer, Cleary, Barnosky & Armentano, P.C., Uniondale, NY
