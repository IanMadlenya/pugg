        $(6$)TAYLOR--Paul Edward Jr. We are deeply saddened by the passing of Paul E. Taylor Jr., who served New YorkPresbyterian Hospital as a Trustee for 30 years. He lent his exceptional talent and energy to an impressive variety of Hospital projects, helping to lead the institution through an important period of expansion and modernization, securing our future for many years to come. Mr. Taylor was instrumental to the establishment of what became the New York-Presbyterian Healthcare System. He served as Vice Chairman of the enterprise in its early formative period and played a major role with the first institutional member, New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens. Mr. Taylor's loyalty and leadership proved to be invaluable to the Hospital as it modernized its physical plant and undertook major new construction, including the Greenberg Pavilion, completed in 1996. He also served for several years as the Chairman of the Hospitals endowment fund and as a member of its Third Century Committee. Mr. Taylor is survived by his wife, Anne Alexis Cote Taylor, a national pioneer in patient advocacy who held leadership positions at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell for many years. He is also survived by six children and their spouses; 19 grandchildren; and his sister. To them and to his many friends, we extend our deepest condolences. John J. Mack Chairman Board of Trustees Dr. Herbert Pardes President and CEO NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and Healthcare System Sanford I. Weill Chairman Board of Overseers Dr. Antonio M. Gotto Jr. Dean Weill Cornell Medical College
