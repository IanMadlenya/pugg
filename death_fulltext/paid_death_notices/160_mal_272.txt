        RAMPAL-Jean-Pierre. With the loss of Jean-Pierre Rampal, we have not only lost a great musician and musical enthusiast beyond compare, but a man who loved life. Given the closeness of our 50 year friendship, this is the loss of a brother. His happy exuberance will remain with us all. Isaac Stern
