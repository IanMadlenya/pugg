        SMITH--Forrest Lee, was the North Star of our family. Scholar, wordsmith, athlete, lifelong sportsman, caregiver and mentor. One of the funniest men on the planet and so much more. The love he shared with my daughter, Kimberly, gave true meaning to soul mate. Dearest Forrest, you left us too soon. Much love always. Carolyn Harcleroad
