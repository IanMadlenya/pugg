        WANGEMAN-Frank G. The members of the Waldorf=Astoria Distinguished Alumni note with deep sorrow the passing of our founder, Frank G. Wangeman. He exemplified the principles of our traditions, that is service, integrity, excellence and leadership. His vision and commitment to the Alumni were always of special importance to him, since its inception in 1975, and we will miss his guidance, wisdom, generosity , and deep devotion to the fraternity he founded. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to his lovely wife, Marie, and his family. John G. Flynn, Chairman, The Waldorf=Astoria Distinguished Alumni
