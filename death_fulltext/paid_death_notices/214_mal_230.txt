        CLEMENTS--Roy. The Officers, Trustees, and members of The Forest Hills Jewish Center mourn the death of Roy Clements, our beloved past-President, and devoted servant of the Jewish community both here and in Israel. Roy's selfless and passionate efforts as President of our synagogue, United Synagogue lay leader, lay member of the Rabbinical Assembly's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, President of MERCAZ USA and MERCAZ OLAMI, and numerous other leadership roles, won him the respect of all those with whom he came in contact, across religious and ideological lines. Within the Conservative Movement, he was a giant. To his beloved Pauline, Stephen and Sharon and the grandchildren, and his sister Cynthia Gershon, we offer the prayer that they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Rabbi Gerald C. Skolnik Cantor Adam Frei Cantor Emeritus Erno Grosz Matt Beizer, President
