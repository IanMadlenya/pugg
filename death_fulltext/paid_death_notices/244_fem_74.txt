        FISHER--Naomi Rubin, died May 8, 2007 aged 85. Cherished wife of David, mother of Paul (Margaret Reid) and Robert (Yasmin Khakoo) and grandmother of M. Caitlin, Jeremy, Gillian, Alex, and Aliya. She has lived under the cruel cloud of Alzheimer's disease for nearly 15 years. But those fortunate enough to remember her before her affliction knew a gentle and loving woman with remarkable skills as a journalist. Her creative imagination inspired her to synthesize a play-byplay account of a baseball game (Brooklyn Dodgers, of course) entirely with lines from Shakespeare; her versatility enabled her to write radio scripts for the Office of War Information, and to work as editor of Soviet Russia Today and of Consumer Reports, to win high regard as a labor journalist -a reporter for the NMU Pilot, an editor for Trade Union Service and New York bureau chief for Federated Press; and when McCarthyism made labor journalism untenable, she was able to adapt to her craft the field of medical journalism, first as a writer for the American Heart Association and for the Arthritis Foundation, then as Managing Editor of Emergency Medicine and Manuscript Editor of Hospital Practice. Underlying all was a peerless sense of craft and of the shape of language. A colleague once remarked, ''Naomi can spot a typo across the room, even if she can't speak the language.''
