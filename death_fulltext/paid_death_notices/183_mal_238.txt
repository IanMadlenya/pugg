        WHITE-Byron R. The members of our Association of former Assistant United States Attorneys mourn the passing and celebrate the eminent career of The Honorable Byron R. White. In particular, during his tenure as Deputy Attorney General, Justice White, to whom we reported, taught us integrity and hard work by example, and with his extraordinary intellect helped us understand our proper role. And this down-to-earth man could relate well to anyone; he took his job seriously, but never himself. Most importantly, Byron White always did what he thought was right, no matter who might try to steer him elsewhere. He was ever true to our oath of office, which enjoined us all to serve the public ''without fear or favor.'' Robert M. Morgenthau Association
