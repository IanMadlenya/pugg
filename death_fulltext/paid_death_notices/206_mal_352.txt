        HAUSMAN--Leo. The Board of Directors and staff of The Lown Cardiovascular Research Foundation are deeply saddened by the passing of our long-time friend and benefactor, Leo Hausman. As a dedicated member of our Board of Directors, Leo gave generously his gifts of counsel, insight, candor and time, helping to make the Foundation and, indeed the world, a better place. While we will miss his passion, his unselfish energy and his inimitable sense of adventure, we are everlastingly grateful for the guidance and vision he always provided. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his children, Martin and Helaine Hausman, Jane and Richard Karp, and to their entire families. Bernard Lown, M.D., Chairman Emeritus Thomas B. Graboys, M.D., Chairman and President Carole A. Nathan, Exec. Dir. Lown Cardiovascular Research Foundation
