        KASHA--Matthew P. was the guiding force behind the sound installations at the Mercury Lounge, the Bowery Ballroom, and most recently Webster Hall. His creative genius, unfailing ear, and insistence on quality has given musicians and fans the best sound they can get in New York City. And this longtime Yankee fanatic pitched the Bowery softball team to its championship in 2000! As a sound engineer he was awarded gold records for numerous songs, such as Cameo's ''Word Up.'' But most importantly, Matthew gave much more. Matthew, with your big heart and passion, and with your keen mind and wit, you brought laughter, love, encouragement, and warmth, mischievous fun and incredible perceptive smarts to us all. We will hold on to what you gave us forever-but we so sorely want more. You have no idea how many people will miss you, and how deeply. $(6$)KASHA--Matthew Pawling. February 11, 1960-December 26, 2005. Beloved son of Audrey Sisson Kasha and the late Alfred R. Kasha. Graveside service 11 AM, Thursday, December 29, at the Warwick Cemetery, Warwick, NY.
