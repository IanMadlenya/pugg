        MANDER--Noel. 93, the pipe organ builder, died September 18, 2005. Mander founded NP Mander in 1936, but shelved it for the duration of WWII during which he fought. After the war Mander restored his firm and eventually, the reputation of the British organ building tradition. He went on to build and restore fine instruments around the world, including those of St. Paul's Cathedral and Canterbury Cathedral. He was much loved.
