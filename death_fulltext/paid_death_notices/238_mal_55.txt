        MORSE--Gerald J. dies at 85 Gerald J. Morse, a volunteer who helped run the Lower Manhattan Marketing Association for 20 years, died Sept. 28. He was 85. Morse was born in Brooklyn on Nov. 1, 1920 to Leah and Benjamin Mofsovitz. He later shortened his name to Morse. He graduated from City College with an accounting degree. He was married to Sara K. Richman, who died in 1998, for 58 years. He had a passion for music and art and was an accomplished musician, havinG two of his songs published in earlier years. Mr. Morse created Talk-A-Walk walking tours on cassette tapes (which he scripted and produced). He was intelligent, sophisticated, charming with both wit and humor. Described by friends as a real gentleman and a sane and sensible voice of Lower Manhattan, he was the glue that held Loma together. ''Gerry was a retired publishing executive and he had spent most of his career between London and New York'', said Rae Ann Hoffman, a founding member of Loma and a long time friend. He was attracted to Lower Manhattan for a variety of reasons, not the least of which was the history. John Haworth, the director of the Indian Museum at Bowling Green, said he remembered meeting Gerry at his first Loma meeting. ''My first impression was here is this very energetic guy who was in retirement and just giving his all to Lower Manhattan. It was sort of like Gerry was a part of the history of Lower Manhattan''. Mr. Morse is survived by his daughters, Darienne Franks, who lives in Bridgewater, NJ; Alison Cohen and her husband Richard of Plainfield, NJ; Dr. Margot Cseley and her husband Tibor of Atlanta, GA; along with five grandchildren, two greatgrandchildren and nieces and nephews who loved and respected him.
