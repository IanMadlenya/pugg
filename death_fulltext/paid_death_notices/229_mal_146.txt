        KASS--Robert, ''Rob.'' We deeply mourn the loss of our dear friend and colleague, Rob Kass, and extend our warmest sympathies to his wife Linda Lagos-Kass, his sons Michael and Jason, and daughter-in-law Amy, as well as a wonderful extended family and many friends. We also remember the support and guidance he provided during his eight year tenure at Choice Logistics as our President and COO. He had a passion for his work, and even more so, he loved all of his associates dearly. Choice Logistics is having a Memorial Service for Mr. Kass at the Church Center for the United Nations at 777 United Nations Plaza (44th St and 1st Ave), NY, NY 10017 on Monday, February 13, 2006 at 5 PM.
