        KENNY-Jay. A man respected and beloved by all those who knew him. Though his family and friends mourn that he left us so young, we know he lived life to the fullest. His love of theater and the arts and his desire to share this love with others were hallmarks of his grace and his style and his passion for life. We honor Jay's memory and give our most heartfelt condolences to his family. George K. Cooney The Screen Gems Family
        KENNY-Jay. Because you spent so much of your life filling up spaces and lives with your energy and enthusiasm, the emptiness created by your leaving is that much more profound and enduring. I am so grateful to have shared your incredible spirit. You will always be ''the Honey'' to me. Love, Steven
