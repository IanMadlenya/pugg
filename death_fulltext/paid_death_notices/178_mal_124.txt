        KOHLER-James E. The Kings County District Attorney and his staff mourn with deep sorrow the passing of James E. Kohler, beloved husband of Jeanne, wife of more than 40 years. Loving father of Patricia, James, Michael, Teresa, Andrew and Jeanne and beloved grandfather of T.J., Kaitlin, Sean, Christopher and William. James was a man of honor, goodness and decency, who served the people of Kings County with distinction as a Deputy District Attorney for 12 years. He was a cherished and loyal friend, fierce and fair litigator and mentor to many in his personal and professional life. His brilliant mind, twinkling eyes, and indomitable spirit will be missed but remembered by all those whose lives he touched. Charles J.
