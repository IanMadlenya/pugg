        MURRAY-Rev. John, C.M. The St. John's University Board of Trustees notes, with profound sorrow, the passing of its colleague, Trustee Emeritus Rev. John P. Murray, C.M. He dedicated himself to God in a priesthood that spanned more than fifty years. He was a member of the Board of Trustees of St. John's University for more than three decades, providing a model of wisdom in humility and compassion in strength. The University community expresses its affection and esteem but, moreover, its gratitude for the many ways by which he enriched us by so generously sharing his many gifts and extraordinary faith. Our love and prayers are with his family and his Vincentian confreres. Denis P. Kelleher, Chair Rev. Donald J. Harrington, C.M., President
