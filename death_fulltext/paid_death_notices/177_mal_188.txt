        DEFENDINI-Richard. The Division of Neuropathology and the Department of Pathology at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons mourn the loss of our respected friend and colleague, Dr. Richard Defendini, 75, who passed away on October 9, 2001. An accomplished neurologist and neuropathologist, Richard was a mainstay of our Division for 25 years after joining the faculty in 1970. He was widely admired for his broad knowledge and scholarly approach to clinical neuroscience. We will miss his experience, counsel and optimistic view of life. Our deep condolences to his wife, Alma Elena del Villar, and family. James E. Goldman, M.D., Ph.D. Arthur P. Hays, M.D. Michael L. Shelanski, M.D., Ph.D. Divison of Neuropathology
