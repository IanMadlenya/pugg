We extend heartfelt condolences to Harvey Wolinetz, Mollie Fein, Tammy Schaum, Rena Katz, Atara Reichel, Aaron Wolinetz, Rabbi Hyman Fein and Arthur Fein on the passing of his wife, her daughter, their mother and sister. Naomi's life centered around her adoring family whom she showered with love and affection. She cherished her many friends, and they reciprocated her warmth and sincerity with affection and kindness. Her many deeds of chesed and tzedekah, arm and arm with Harvey, made a lasting difference to a myriad of Jewish causes. The medical center has been blessed to have Naomi and Harvey as Diamond Founders and cherished supporters of our centers of excellence. May the warm memories of the times they spent together provide some measure of solace, and may the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
