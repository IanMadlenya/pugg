        PETRIE--Elizabeth M. The Board of Trustees and staff of the Whitney Museum of American Art note with great sadness the passing of our dear friend, Elizabeth M. Petrie. Elizabeth served on the Whitney Museum Board of Trustees from 1981 through 1991. During her tenure, she provided the Museum with much guidance and insight through her leadership of the Building Committee and membership in the Executive and Leadership Gifts Committees, among others. Her generosity to and support of the Whitney Museum, especially the Library Fellows, made her a well respected and beloved member of our Whitney Family, and she will be deeply missed. We extend our most heartfelt condolences to her children, Janet Hallstrom Scurria and Theodore A. Hallstrom II, and her entire family. Leonard A. Lauder, Chairman Robert J. Hurst, President Maxwell L. Anderson, Director Flora Miller Biddle, Honorary Chairman >>AD#
