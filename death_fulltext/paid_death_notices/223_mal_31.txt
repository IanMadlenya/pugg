        ZANKEL--Arthur. The Board of Trustees of Skidmore College and the entire Skidmore family deeply mourn the death of Arthur Zankel, father of Skidmore graduates, trustee emeritus, generous benefactor, loyal friend, and honorary degree recipient. As a trustee, Art brought a wealth of experience, a quick wit, and an incisive mind to bear on the challenges facing the College. As a member of our investment committee, he helped us to build and invest our resources wisely, fueling an unprecedented period of growth in the College's programs and reputation. That same passion and wisdom was evident in his philanthropy at Skidmore, which included significant contributions to provide scholarships and to underwrite programs such as the summer residency of the Boys Choir of Harlem. In addition, he endowed a professorship--the Zankel Chair in Management for Liberal Arts Students, which reflected his belief that liberal arts majors often end up practicing much more management and business than they expect--and a lecture series--the Zankel Lectures, which serves as a forum for the discussion of business issues from a broader societal and ethical perspective. Art leaves an impressive legacy of generosity, commitment, and integrity that will inspire and empower generations of Skidmore students and faculty. He will always be a part of the fabric of our community and we send our deepest condolences to his wife, Judy; his sons, Kenneth (Class of 1982), James (Class of 1992), Mark, and Thomas; his brothers, Martin and Jeffrey; and his grandchildren.
