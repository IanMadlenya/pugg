        PESLIKIS-Irene. Died November 28, 2002. One of the founders of the Women's Art Movement, she organized the first show of Second Wave Women Artists, taught the first college women and art course, and founded a feminist art school, The Feminist Art Institute. With Patricia Mainardi, she founded the journal ''Women and Art'', which gave the portraitist Alice Neel prominence. Neel's portrait of Irene was reproduced on the cover of the Summer 2002 issue of Feminist Studies. A founder of the Noho Gallery, one of the first cooperative feminist galleries, she was also a founder of Redstockings, a leading feminist theoretical and consciousness-raising group in New York City, and a member of New York Radical Women. Her political cartoons were widely circulated in the early women's liberation movement. Before her knees gave out she was a karate giant and a long-distance biker. Her sisters in History in Action, second and third wave feminists, celebrate her life, mourn our loss and rededicate ourselves to a global commitment for women's liberation, social justice and peace. There will be a memorial at the Studio School sometime in the future. History in Action is setting up a memorial fund in her name. For more information, email rosybax@aol.com.
