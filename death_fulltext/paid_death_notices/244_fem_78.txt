        LEI--Taiwai. We mourn the passing of Taiwai Lei, beloved daughter of Heng Mao Li and Kai Qu Dai. Taiwai was born October 12, 1978 in Shanghai and passed away May 8, 2007 in New York after a courageous battle with lymphoma. She received her B.S. at Cornell University and studied at Columbia University for her MBA. Taiwai was an avid reader and always loved a healthy intellectual debate. She had a wonderful eye for style and made everything around her as beautiful as she was. Her incredible zest for life spread joy to all around her. She will be sorely missed by all whose lives she touched, especially Erik with whom she shared a true love. A memorial service will be held at Chun Fook Funeral Services on May 11, 2007 from 3:30 until 7:00 pm.
