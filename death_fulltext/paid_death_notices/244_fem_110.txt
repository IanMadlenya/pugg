        SHELTON--Miss Frances Elizabeth was the daughter of Dr. and Mrs. John B. Shelton and was born in Decatur, Alabama on January 24, 1919. After graduating from high school, she visited New York City with her mother and ultimately decided to enroll at The Julliard School based on that fateful visit. She was awarded a Diploma in Piano and a minor in Organ from The Julliard School. During her lifetime, Miss Shelton performed in recitals in New York City, in Toronto, Canada, and throughout Florida. She also taught at La Guardia High School of the Performing Arts for 20 years. Miss Shelton is a descendant of an early Virginia family and was a very active member of several societies. She was a member of the United Daughters of the Confederacy for 53 years and was the current New York Division President prior to her death. She was also a member of the New York City Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) and served as its Regent from 1988 to 1991 and was its Chapter Historian prior to her death. Miss Shelton also served as New York State DAR Historian from 1998 to 2001. She was also an active member in several other societies including: the Jamestowne Society; the Colonial Dames of America; the Sons and Daughters of the Pilgrims; the Huguenot Society of America; and, the oldest woman's club in America, Sorosis. Miss Shelton was also listed in the social registry. Miss Shelton leaves innumerable friends and appreciative former students as well as family in whose hearts and memories she will remain forever. A memorial service and burial is planned for May 19, 2007, at 11:00am at Roselawn Gardens of Memory and Funeral Home in Decatur, Alabama. In lieu of flowers, donations can be sent benefiting both the UDC and DAR to the Frances Shelton Memorial Fund, Po Box 230657; New York City 10023.
