        ROSE-Pauline. Widow of Bennett Rose, devoted mother of Peter Rose, Judy and Michael Margulies, doting grandmother of Arthur and David Margulies and Jennifer Ginsberg, loving and adored aunt and friend, died in her 91st year. She was a role model for several generations of admirers. Always gracious and with impressive dignity and bearing, she expressed her caring quietly and in a nonjudgmental manner. She enriched everyone who knew her. Family, lifelong friends and strangers came away knowing they were touched by rare beauty and gentleness.
