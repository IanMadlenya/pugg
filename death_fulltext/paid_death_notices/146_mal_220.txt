        NEILL-Nancy. The Board of Trustees and staff of the South Street Seaport Museum express deepest sympathies to our fellow Board member and Museum President, Peter Neill, and his family at the passing of his mother. Nancy was an intelligent, stylish lady who combined humor with a great interest in life. We know that she will be sorely missed and extend our sincere condolences.
