        GOLDSTINE-Marcy. Unexpectedly and too soon on Feb. 25, 2002. Loving wife of Robert Mongioi, cherished daughter of Jerome and Fredricka, devoted stepmother of Adam and Mathew, dear sister of Susan and Bob, favorite aunt of Samantha, Ryan and Steven. Her historic accomplishments include: being the founder of Super Glue Corporation presiding as President for 16 years, and being the first woman account executive on the commodities desk at Merrill Lynch. She blazed the trail for others to follow but most of all, her wit, style, compassion and unconditional love will be etched forever in the hearts and minds of her family and dear friends. Services held on Friday at her sister's home in Beverly Hills, California.
