        ORNSTEIN-Sara Moore. Ended her journey at home December 20, 1997 surrounded by love. This sweet, generous woman of principle cared about others to her last moments. She is survived by her husband Reuben, adored throughout their 68 years of marriage and loving family, son Martin and daughter-in-law Goldie Ornstein, daughter Virginia and son-in-law Steve Abrams, her grandchildren Steven , Judy and husband Joel, Jonathan Marc and wife Barbara, Joshua and wife Emily and her great grandchildren Joseph, Jo Ellen Pearl, Lawrence, Michael and Matthew. We were all so lucky to have her for 91 years. She was a ''genuine article.'' Contributions in her memory may be made to Jacob Perlow Hospice at Beth Israel Hospital, 1st Ave at 16th Street, New York, New York 10003.
