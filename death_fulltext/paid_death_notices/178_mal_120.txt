        CINISOMO-Edmund. We all live on borrowed time! How Daytop's Vice President for Texas's and California's Youth life-saving efforts, Ed Cinisomo, reflected that reality. Armed with more than two decades of inspired leadership, captaining treatment Staff in major Daytop treatment centers across New York State, he relished the assignment to offer the branch of safety to legions of troubled youth being swept downstream from raging family crises across the Lone Star and Golden Gate States. Thousands of the young today lay claim upon his legacy. We return to his God a Soul who bore lasting impact during his 'borrowed time'! Heaven favor his journey! (Msgr.) William B. O'Brien President, Daytop Village, Inc.
