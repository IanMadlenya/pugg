        GIBSON-Mary Rose Stroock, died on August 22, 1998. Mary has left family and friends with a void in their lives, but memories that will last forever. May the legacy of love and friendship she has given all of us be passed on to her children and grandchildren, as they are the most precious gifts of all. Forever friends, Barbara Levey and family.
