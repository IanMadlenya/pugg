        MURPHY-Nancy (Pearsall), 53, died August 4, 2001, peacefully at her home in Croton-on-Hudson after a courageous battle with inflammatory breast cancer. She was born December 21, 1947 in Portland, Oregon to Douglas (deceased) and Inga Pearsall. Besides her mother, she is survived by her husband Michael, her sons Jonathan and Phillip, and brothers Michael and Charles Pearsall. Nancy was an inspiration to all who knew her as wife, mother, friend, quilter, and cancer survivor. She loved and was a highly talented quilter and a member of the Croton Pointers and the Northern Star Quilters Guild. After being diagnosed with breast cancer, Nancy joined and became a valued member of the Support Connection of Yorktown Heights, New York, where she shared her counsel and love of quilting with other breast cancer survivors. With the assistance of some close friends, she created ''Nancy's Quilt'', a fund-raising project to raise awareness of the disease and financial support for cancer research. At the time of her death, plans for a second quilt in this series were underway and are proceeding. The deep grief shared by her family and friends on her untimely death is tempered by their unforgettable memories of her courage, compassion, and humor in the face of great adversity. Friends may visit Tuesday (August 7) 2-4 and 7-9 PM at Edward F. Carter Funeral Home, 41 Grand Street, Croton-on-Hudson, New York. A funeral Mass will be celebrated at 10:00 on Wednesday morning (August 8) at St. Augustine's Church, Eagle Park, Ossining, New York. Donations in Nancy's memory may be made to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Ave., New York, NY, or the Support Connection, 360 Underhill Ave., Yorktown Heights.
