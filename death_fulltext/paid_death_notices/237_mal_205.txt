        FRISCHMAN--Sol. A man of great energy and fierce will, died October 18, at the venerable age of 105. Born in Austria in 1901, on his own since the age of 14, he emigrated to the U.S. Exhilarated by the freedom he found here, he became a driving force in the retail community of the Bronx, founding Frishman's, a women's specialty store during the depression in 1932, and still in existence. Married to the late Regina for 72 glorious years. Father of Elaine and Sandi. Grandfather of Denise, Juliet, Rebecca, Diana and Eric, and 11 greatgranddaughters. He was an unfailing inspiration to three generations.
