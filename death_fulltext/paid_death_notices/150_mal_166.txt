        WEBSTER-Beveridge. The Juilliard School deeply mourns the death of faculty member emeritus, Beveridge Webster, who was a member of the piano faculty from 1946 to 1990. Through his artistic integrity, his brilliant intellect and his engaging wit, Beveridge enriched the entire institution and had an enormously positive influence on the art of the piano in America and around the world. We send our deepest condolences to his wife and his entire family.
