        COPLIN-Irwin. On March 6th at age 74. Quietly in his own home from pancreatic cancer. Irwin had a successful career in advertising, sales promotion and business development for 55 years, most recently serving as Vice Chairman of the National Board of Directors of SCORE, and working on behalf of the small business administration in Romania, Bulgaria, Russia, Ukraine, and China. Irwin never had a bad thing to say about anyone he ever met. His infectious ebullience and unyielding enthusiasm for the most mundane aspects of life endeared him to all with whom he had contact. He is survived by his sister and brother-in-law Renee and Robert Beningson, his sons and daughters-in-law William and Mariko, Joseph and Jenna, their children Max, Hannah, and Maxine, his nieces Robin and Susan Beningson, and myriad friends and loved ones. Memorial service Sunday, March 9th, 11:15 AM at The Riverside Memorial Chapel, 76 St and Amsterdam Ave. Interment to follow at Temple Beth El Cemetery, Roxbury Road, Stamford, CT. Shiva will be between the hours of 5:00 PM and 9:00 PM on Sunday and Monday at the Manhattan home of Renee and Robert Beningson, 800 fifth Ave. Donations in Irwin's name to the University of Chicago, 888-824-4224 and Vassar College, 845-437-5400 in lieu of flowers, please.
