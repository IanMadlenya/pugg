        BUDARZ -- Camille Antoi nette. The House of Steinway & Sons notes with great sorrow the untimely passing of the American pianist Camille Antoinette Budarz, during a flight in route to Florida on December 21, 2005 at the age of 70. Camille Budarz was a beloved member of our Steinway Artist family for twenty-five years. Born in Pittsburgh, Ms. Budarz started piano lessons at the age of four and was a scholarship student at The Juilliard School where she studied with Joseph Raieff. After winning the inaugural Paderewski Prize of the Kosciusko Foundation, Ms. Budarz became the first American pianist to study with Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli in Arezzo. During a concert life that took her throughout the United States, Europe and Japan, Ms. Budarz taught at The Juilliard School, the Riverdale School of Music, and was Artist in Residence at St. Mary of the Woods College in Indiana. Ms. Budarz was a vital and cherished friend to all of us at Steinway throughout her career. We will miss her, and we extend our heartfelt condolences to her husband David Kornreich and her family.
