        FELD-Eva. The Board of Trustees and professional staff of the Museum of American Folk Art record with profound sorrow the death of their friend, Eva Feld, an Honory Trustee of the Museum. A person of great kindness, quiet dignity and generosity of spirit, Eva Feld touched the hearts of everyone who had the privilege of knowing her. Through the Eva and Morris Feld Acquisitions Fund, she contributed significantly to the development of the Museum's permanent collection as a major public resource. Her warm encouragement and support lead to the establishment in 1989 of the Museum's Eva and Morris Feld Gallery at Lincoln Square. She will be remembered with abiding gratitude and affection.
