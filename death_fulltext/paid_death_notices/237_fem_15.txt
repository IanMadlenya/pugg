        POLISH--Muriel Wallick, after a tenacious fight against cancer. The end came abruptly on September 30. Beloved wife of Jack, devoted mother of Beth and Nathaniel, dear sister of the late Ruth Wallick Lipson and Mel Wallick, loving mother-in-law of Philip Friedman and Ellen Schorr, adoring grandmother of Anna Rose and Isadora. Peerless hostess, ardent New Yorker, compassionate social worker, elegant and discerning dealer in decorative objects, deeply missed by the countless friends she nurtured. She was gracious, brave, and classy to the very end. Services at Plaza, 91st St. and Amsterdam, Tuesday, 1 pm. In lieu of flowers, donations to Human Rights First, 333 7th Ave, NYC 10117.
