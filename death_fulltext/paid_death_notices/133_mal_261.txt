        GORRELICK-Rabbi Benjamin H. We note with sadness the passing of our beloved colleague. Ordained in 1934, he served for 55 years at Congregation Beth Achim in Detroit, MI. After many years in the rabbinate he became emeritus of Beth Achim 29 years ago. We extend our deepest condolences to his daughter Elisheva, to his grandchildren and to all who were touched through his rabbinate. Rabbi David L. Lieber, President Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Exec. VP The Rabbinical Assembly
