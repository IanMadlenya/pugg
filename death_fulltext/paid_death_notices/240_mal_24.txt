With deep sadness, we mourn the passing of our beloved friend, colleague, and mentor, Herman Schmertz. We send our heartfelt condolences to those he loved so deeply: his wife Judi, his daughter Gail and son-in-law Bruce, his son Robert and daughter-in-law Debbie, and his five grandchildren. As our partner in charge of appeals for more than three decades, he had the primary responsibility for preparing as well as arguing the firm's appeals and for writing legal memoranda in all of our areas of practice. He was our in-house source of legal knowledge, a true scholar who loved the intricacies of the law, always available to share his advice and wisdom. His unique talent for researching, knowing, remembering, and analyzing the law earned him the respectful and affectionate title of ''The Law Man.'' As our friend, he was gentle, kind, humorous, and supportive. We will remember Herman always, and we will miss him greatly. Gair, Gair, Conason, Steigman & Mackauf $(6$)SCHMERTZ--Herman.
