        BROWN-Raymond E., S.S. The Board of Directors, the Faculty and Staff of Union Theological Seminary in New York City are deeply saddened by the untimely loss of our beloved colleague and friend, Raymond E. Brown. For almost two decades Professor Brown blessed Union Theological Seminary with his teaching, his publications, his ecumenical involvements, and his gentle and wise presence. As Auburn Distinguished Professor of Biblical Studies, he was the first Roman Catholic ever to hold a tenured position on the faculty. A distinguished teacher and researcher of international acclaim, he attracted students in large numbers, filling the classroom to overflowing. Yet his erudition never obscured clarity and simplicity. He will be deeply missed. Our condolences to his brother, Robert J. Brown and to the Society of St. Sulpice, of which he was a member. A Mass of Christian burial will be held on Monday, August 17 at 10:30A.M. at Our Lady of the Angels Chapel, Catonsville, MD. A memorial service is tentatively planned at Union Theological Seminary on Friday, October 2, 1998. Anne Hale Johnson, Chair, Board of Directors The Rev. Mary E. McNamara, Interim President Dr. Rosemary Keller, Academic Dean
