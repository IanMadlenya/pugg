        COLTOFF-Kay S. Died peacefully at 2:45PM on Thursday, March 5, 1998 at the age of 61. She was, to the very last moment of her life, a loving, caring, beautiful woman whose last breaths were for her husband Phil, children Julie and Peter, her grandchild Noah and her two step-children Michael and Robert. She loved living and life and did so with gusto. She was a social worker, teacher, artist and folk singer. She saw only the best in people and had a love for all. Her family, friends, colleagues and students will remember her as a person who helped to make their world better.
