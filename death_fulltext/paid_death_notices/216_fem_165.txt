        de los ANGELES--Victoria. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of a cherished artist, soprano Victoria de los Angeles, who brought patrician style, consummate musicianship and irresistible charm to everything she sang. Between 1951 and 1961 Met audiences were privileged to hear her in 139 performances of thirteen roles, most notably as Marguerite in ''Faust,'' Mimi in ''La Boheme,'' Cio-Cio-San in ''Madama Butterfly,'' Rosina in ''Il Barbiere di Siviglia,'' and in the title role of ''Manon.'' The world of opera has lost one of its greatest stars, but we are fortunate that her recorded legacy remains to remind future generations of her art. Joseph Volpe, General Mgr. James Levine, Music Dir.
