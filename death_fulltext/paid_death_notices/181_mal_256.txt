        NABATOFF-Robert A., M.D. The Association of the Attending Staff of the Mount Sinai Hospital mourns the passing of a beloved colleague, teacher and friend. Dr. Nabatoff was an outstanding member of our staff for almost 50 years. He was a dedicated and talented surgeon who demonstrated an extraordinary concern for his patients. He was involved in early mitral valve surgery and helped generate fundamental advances in cardiovascular research. He was also responsible for the growth of ambulatory surgery at Mount Sinai. He was a great supporter of the institution and was the recipient of the Jacobi Medallion Award in 1965. Dr. Nabatoff is described as a ''wonderful physician and human being.'' We extend our sincere condolences to his entire family. Anthony Squire, M.D., President Vicki Lopachin, M.D., Secretary Amy Weinstein, Administrator
