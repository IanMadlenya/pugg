        GREENSPAN--Phyllis. The officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the loss of Phyllis Greenspan, beloved wife of Murray H. Greenspan, lifelong leaders of the Jewish community whose boundless generosity and devotion profoundly impacted millions of lives. Phyllis' deep commitment to our Women's Campaign and Murray's service as chair of our Malverne Jewish Center Campaign strengthened our ability to care for those in need. We extend our deepest sympathies to Murray; to their daughters: Ellen Sklover; Marsha Kalson, and her husband, Michael; Barbara Harari, and her husband, Rob; to their grandchildren; and to the entire family. Morris W. Offit, President Susan K. Stern, Chair of the Board John S. Ruskay, Exec. V.P. & C.E.O.
