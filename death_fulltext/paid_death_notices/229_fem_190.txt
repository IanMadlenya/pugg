        KAUFMAN--Mabel. The full and generous life of Mabel Goldfarb Kaufman ended on February 9, but her memory will long remain with those who had the good fortune to know her. Born in New York City, she was the loving wife of Irving for 63 years; the nurturing mother of Alan and Marc; grandmother to David, John and Kaylin; sister to Kitty and Elayne; and mother-inlaw to Terrie and Lynn. She taught elementary school in Ann Arbor, MI and later was a professor at City College in New York, at Bank Street College of Education, and at Teachers College, Columbia University, where she had earned her doctorate in 1971. She was 82 at her passing and was buried at Shaarey Pardes Cemetery in East Hampton. A memorial service will be held later in the year. In lieu of flowers, contributions to the East Hampton library would be appreciated.
