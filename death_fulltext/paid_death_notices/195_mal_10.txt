        GHENT - Emmanuel, M.D. The Postdoctoral Program notes with profound sorrow the death of Emmanuel Ghent, M.D. He was a gifted, innovative clinician, theoretician, and teacher, central to the Program's activities since its inception, and founder of the Relational Orientation. We will miss his grace, gentility, inspiration, vitality, and most especially his ability to find joy in the darkest hour.

        GHENT-Emmanuel. It is with deep sorrow and a sense of profound personal loss that the editors of ''Psychoanalytic Dialogues'' mark the passing of their dear friend and colleague, Emmanuel Ghent. The breadth and range of his interests and talents were matched only by the generosity with which he promoted and nurtured a new generation of psychoanalysts. He will be sorely missed by all of those whose lives he touched.
