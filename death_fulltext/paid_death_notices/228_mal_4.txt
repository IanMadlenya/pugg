        KAPNER--Frederick. An editor for the Financial Times, Frederick, age 45, died suddenly on December 29, 2005, in London. Beloved husband of Paola, father of Julia and Sveva, and devoted son of Catherine and Stanley H. Kapner of Manhattan. A graduate of Lycee Francais and Columbia University, he reported for Bloomberg News (Paris) and The Associated Press (Milan) before joining FT as Milan bureau chief. In 2004 he became FT editor of european political and general news in London. A talented journalist and a lovely family man, Fred will be sorely missed.
