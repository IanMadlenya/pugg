        POSNER--Honorable Charles A. Compassionate Jurist, devoted husband to Lynn, adoring father to Beth and Mark, delighted grandfather and dedicated public servant to the people of Brooklyn. Charles served as a Kings County Executive Assistant District Attorney from 1990 until his appointment to the bench in 1995. His humor and wisdom were generously shared with all who knew him. It was his belief in the power of our children that led Charles to develop the District Attorney's Office Legal Lives Program, now in over 300 classrooms in Brooklyn. Every day throughout Kings County there are detectives, Assistant District Attorneys and staff members empowering children to fight drugs and violence and opening their hearts and minds to appreciating diversity. Friends and former colleagues join me in expressing our deepest sympathy to his family. He will be deeply missed, but his spirit lives on through this legacy to the children of Brooklyn. Charles J. Hynes
