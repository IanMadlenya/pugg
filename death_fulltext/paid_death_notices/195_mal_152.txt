        PERKINS-Richard S. The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art deeply mourn the passing of Richard S. Perkins, a devoted Trustee and Benefactor who served for many years on the visiting committee to the Department of Islamic Art as well as on various Trustee Committees. During his tenure as a Trustee (1963-1987), and as a Trustee Emeritus in the years since, he was a generous donor of works of art and funds to the Museum. He served this institution with distinction and will be greatly missed. We offer our sincere condolences to his family. James R. Houghton Chairman Philippe de Montebello Director David E.
