        THOMASSET-Paul A. Born on November 30, 1902, passed away January 8, 1999. Paul came alone to this country from France when he was sixteen. At 20 years of age he attended Cooper Union and studied engineering. Paul became a pigment chemist and was general manager of Anshcher Siegle in Staten Island. In 1946 he started his own business, Thomasset Colors Inc. manufacturing cosmetic and industrial pigments. Over the course of his business career, he brought a high level of discipline and a rigorous rationality to his field of expertise and to those who worked under his supervision with many going on to become leaders in the industry. He was a great teacher. Married to Henrietta Bridgewater until her death, they produced one son, Paul B., three grandsons, Paul C., Lelend P., and Clifford B. and four great grandchildren, Carly, Paul D., Ian and Genevieve, all of whom will miss his good cheer, great intelligence, and love. He is predeceased by his second wife of 12 years, Yolanda. It is for us to carry on his love of the old world ways and challenge of the new. His view of life was ''adapt or die'' and his life was a triumph of adaption, curiosity, art, music, science and politics. A memorial fund has been established at Cooper Union, (212) 353-4100.
