        MOKOTOFF-Harold S. Of Sagaponack, on Monday, April 7, 2003, at age 92. Loving father to Peter Mokotoff (deceased at age 10), Steffi Berne and Moke Mokotoff. Loving and devoted husband to Rhoda, who passed away in 1997, and ever-encouraging grandfather to Lizzie Berne, Alexander Berne and Sophia Mokotoff; son-in-law Robert Berne, daughter-in-law Hue Mokotoff and caregiver Red Mackey. Our lives were profoundly nurtured by the warmth of his insight and humor. As a member of the NYS Bar for over half a century, his dedicated professional work improved the lives of thousands.
