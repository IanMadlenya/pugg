        SWANSON-Robert. Bob's spirit and leadership provided the world with a new industry, impacted the lives of many patients and enriched our careers beyond measure. He built the special place we are proud to call Genentech. Our condolences to his mother, wife and daughters Sandra Braem, Sharon Manering, Kelley Peace, Peg Raimondi-Scott and Maribeth Southworth.
