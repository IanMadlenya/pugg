        STONE-Lauson Harvey. The Horace Mann Community deeply mourns the loss of our cherished friend, former student and esteemed member of Horace Mann's Board of Trustees, Lauson Harvey Stone, HM '21. A graudate of Harvard College and Columbia University Law School, Mr. Stone first served on the Horace Mann Board of Trustees in 1947, then subsequently served on the Policy and Development Committee, the Executive Committee, and the Admissions and Scholarship Committee. He was appointed both Vice Chairman and Chairman of the Joint Conference Committee and served on the Board of Trustees until 1965 when he was made Honorary Trustee. A wonderful advocate for Horace Mann, he displayed interest and pride in the work of the faculty and the students. Our deepest sympathy is extended to his widow, Jane and to his two sons, Peter and Harlan. May his memory and his work continue to inspire all of us. Michael D. Hess, HM '58 Chair, Board of Trustees
