        GENDIN-Stephen. It is with great sadness that we mourn the loss of our beloved board member, colleague, and friend Stephen Gendin. His unyielding commitment to Aid for AIDS, working to improve HIV healthcare for the world's poor, will never be forgotten and will continue to be an inspiration to us all. We express our deepest heartfelt sympathy to his surviving partner, Kyle ''Hush'' MacDowell, and his friends, family, and colleagues who were equally touched by his strength, dignity, and love of life.
