        SHOOKHOFF-Francine. The firm, Joyce Leslie, that Fran represented for 34 years joins her family in mourning. She was a wonderful and beautiful person, who will be missed by all who were touched by her. Francine's loyalty, honesty and sincerity will be missed. She set an example for us all to follow.
