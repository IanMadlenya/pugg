He was a dedicated teacher for 50 years as well as an activist in the New York City Teachers' Union. Called before a government committee investigating Communist Party membership, he was forced to retire from the public school system, but soon resumed teaching at Woodmere Academy, where he was a favorite among students and faculty. A lover of gardening and music, his intellect and charm will be missed by many. A memorial service will be held at 4PM July 10 at the Ethical Culture Society, 2 W. 64th St.
