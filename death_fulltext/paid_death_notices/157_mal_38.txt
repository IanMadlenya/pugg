        REUTERSHAN-Donald E. Skidmore College notes with great sadness the death of trustee emeritus and long-time supporter, Donald E. Reutershan. As a member of the Board of Trustees for 25 years and as its chair from 1979 to 1983, he helped to lead Skidmore through a period of monumental change and growth. His bold advocacy of coeducation, diversity, and the construction of a new campus helped to shape the college he served with such intelligence, loyalty, and affection. The Skidmore community sends its condolences to the Reutershan family. Jamienne S. Studley, President Skidmore College
