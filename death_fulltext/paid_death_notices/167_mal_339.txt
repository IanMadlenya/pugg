        O'MALLEY-James Jr. LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae, L.L.P. mourns with sorrow the December 20 passing of our dear friend and colleague James O'Malley Jr. A renowned energy lawyer and public servant, Jim joined LeBoeuf in 1945, was made partner in 1947 and retired from private practice in 1980. Jim was a true leader and mentor who will be missed by all who knew him. His wife of 56 years, the former Marcella Butler of Montreal, died in 1998. We extend condolences to Jim's children, Anne and Malcolm. A memorial service will be held in New York City in January. For information, contact Parker-Rayfield & Murphy, Newark, NY 315-331-3255.
