        PIGNONE--Sister Jean M., F.M.M. The administration, trustees and staff of St. Francis Hospital, The Heart Center in Roslyn, New York, mourn the passing of Sister Jean M. Pignone of the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary. Sister Jean served St. Francis Hospital in a number of different capacities for over 50 years and was a living and spiritual bridge from the hospital's early days as a summer camp for children to its position today as one of the nation's leading heart centers. Sister Jean was a much beloved member of the St. Francis family. She began her service in 1941 as one of 55 nuns caring for 200 underprivileged children with rheumatic heart disease who lived at the St. Francis Sanatorium. In addition to cooking, cleaning, and providing nursing care, her work included traveling to local farms and asking for contributions of produce to help feed the children. Later, when the institution opened its doors to adult patients and became St. Francis Hospital, Sister Jean directed the volunteers at the information desk and was always a welcoming and cheering presence. Throughout her service, Sister Jean's steadfast commitment to philanthropy became legendary. We will be forever grateful to Sister Jean for her selfless dedication to St. Francis Hospital and her love for all the members of our family. We will cherish her legacy and always be inspired by her example. We extend our deepest sympathies to Sister Jean's family and to the many friends who were touched by her devoted, caring and generous spirit.
