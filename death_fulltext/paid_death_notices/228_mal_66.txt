        BENEZRA--Meyer. A brilliant legal and curious mind died December 29, 2005. Devoted son, father and friend, the Brooklyn College and Columbia Law graduate practiced law in NYC for nearly 60 years, most recently at Weisman Celler Spett & Modlin. Steadfast advisor to the Yeshivah of Crown Heights (CHY) and valued member of its Board of Trustees, he helped nurture the school under the tutelage of his beloved wife, Naomi, its longtime Executive Director, who died in May. The Camp Monroe lovebirds married 50 years ago in December. He gave unselfishly to so many in need, especially to CHY and Bikur Cholim Hospital, Jerusalem. Will be dearly missed by daughters Frada, Ruth, Vivien and Karen, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. Donations can be made to Bikur Cholim, CHY, Magen David Adom and the Young Israel of Bedford Bay, Brooklyn.
