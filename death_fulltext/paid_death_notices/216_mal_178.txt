        SOMMER--Gregg. Suddenly at age 52, on January 11, 2005. Loving son of Terry and Arty; brother of Meryl and Van, uncle of Brette and Drew, and Kirk, sweetheart to Diane. The kindest of heart, truest of friend, and most fun loving of all! Captain Avalanche (aka Bronco Gregg) will always be in our thoughts and will be missed by all who knew him. Services are at the Riverside Memorial Chapel, 76th Street & Amsterdam Ave., Friday, January 14th at 11:30 AM. Mom and Dad
        SOMMER--Gregg. With great sadness our family extends their sympathy to our dearest forever friends Terry & Artie and their children Van and Meryl and grandchildren on the sudden death of their much loved son, brother and uncle. Like his grandmother Bella, his wonderful fun-loving nature will always be remembered. Love, Charlotte Iris & Howard Poppy and Ronny
        SOMMER--Gregg. Our hearts are broken on the untimley death of your beloved son. Joan and Paul Jasper
