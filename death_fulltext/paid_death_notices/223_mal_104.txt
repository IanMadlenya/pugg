        O'BRIEN--Joseph A. 90, beloved father of Robert, Joel, and Geoffrey, adored grandfather of Heather, died in a car accident in Lenox, MA on July 24, 2005. Joe was born on July 16, 1915, in Yonkers. In 1935 he was hired as a radio announcer by WMCA, beginning an association of three decades. In the army, 1945-46, he served in Germany where he wrote and starred in ''The Joe O'Brien Show'' on AFN. For WMCA he hosted the popular ''Gallegher and O'Brien Show,'' 1949-58. Joe's theater work included directing and acting for the Great Neck Community Theatre and the Hampton Playhouse, NH; in 1957 he co-founded the Cricket Theatre in New York, where he directed plays including Bernard Kops' The Hamlet of Stepney Green and Jean Anouilh's Ardele. As one of the WMCA Good Guys he was a major presence in Top 40 radio of the 1960s, and (with his imaginary sidekick ''Benny'') maintained wide popularity in his morning time slot. He left WMCA in 1968 for WNBC, and later moved to WHUD in Peekskill, where he had a daily show from 1972 to 1986; he made his final broadcast in 2000. Joe married the actress Margaret Owens in 1940. Joe and Maggie lived in Red Hook, NY, from the late 1960s until Maggie's death in 1997. In his final years he resided in Rhinebeck, NY. He was a man of wide-ranging intellectual curiosity, with an abiding interest in politics, literature, music, and the performing arts, and an enduring love of travel. His high spirits, energetic conversation, and unfailing humor brought joy to family and friends. He is survived by sons Robert and Geoffrey; Geoffrey's wife Kaalii and their daughter Heather; Joel's wife Harriet Katz; his beloved sister-in-law LaVerne Owens; Yasoko Owens; brother Paul O'Brien and sister Anita Sutor; his dear friend Ruth Meyer, and by friends, admirers, and fans who will miss his electrifying presence.
