        COHEN--Donald, M.D. The officers and members of The New York Psychoanalytic Society and Institute mourn the loss of our esteemed member, Dr. Donald Cohen. He was a training and supervising analyst at our Institute and had served as chairman of the Child Analysis Committee. Donald was a great clinician and a wonderful teacher. Graced with warmth and humor, he cared deeply about children, was devoted and committed to his patients, and was a good friend to his colleagues. We will all miss him. We extend our condolences to Janet, Ted, and Alex. Paul Rosenbaum, M.D., Pres. Philip Herschenfeld, M.D., Dean
