        GUSSMAN--Lawrence. My friend shared with me his love of the Israel Museum, Jerusalem, and African Art. Over several years, he donated a large and important collection of Central African art which resulted in the Israel Museum having a leading world collection. He will forever be remembered, Shalom. Martin Wright, Curator of the Department of the Arts of Africa, Oceania and the Americas, Israel Museum Jerusalem
        GUSSMAN--Lawrence. Larry, you were a great Jewish philanthropist and humanitarian. You gave generously a significant part of your worldrenowned African Art Collection to the Israel Jewish Museum, donated an ambulance to the Magen David, and supported the Sha Sha Institute in Jerusalem. We consider it an honor and privilege to have called you our dear, close friend. The Sarita Gantz Family
