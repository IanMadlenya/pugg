        KERESTINE--Joseph J. Died on December 27, 2005 at age 46, at his home in Manhattan. An ardent supporter of cabaret, jazz and music in all its forms, he embraced life expansively and gave us wonderful lessons in how to live life and love ourselves. He will be greatly missed by his partner of 25 years, William Tracy and by many friends in New York and California. Other survivors include his mother, Veronica Keplar of Brownsville, PA, a sister and two brothers.
