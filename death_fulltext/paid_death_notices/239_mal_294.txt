        HYMAN--Seymour C. The City University of New York mourns the loss of its former Deputy Chancellor and Vice Chancellor. Dr. Hyman served as CUNY's first Vice Chancellor for Campus Planning and Development from 1966-1969 when CUNY was embarking on a major capital construction program, leading a master planning effort for both senior and community colleges. As Deputy Chancellor from 1969-1978, his exemplary leadership helped steer the University through challenging days. We offer our deepest sympathies to his wife, Charlotte, daughters and grandchildren. Benno C. Schmidt Jr, Chairman Board of Trustees Matthew Goldstein, Chancellor
