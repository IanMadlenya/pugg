        KELLAND--Michael Buckner, 62. Died peacefully at his home in New York City on November 27 with his family at his side. He fought a courageous battle and ultimately succumbed to cancer. Beloved husband of Lisa Cobey Kelland and loving father of three children, Jennifer Pierson Kelland of Providence,RI, Michael Cobey Kelland, 14, and William Buckner Kelland, 13. He is also survived by two brothers, Thomas Kelland of Sottsdale, AZ and James Kelland of Palm Desert, CA and an uncle, Horace Kelland, of Charleston, SC. Michael was born on March 29, 1943 in Phoenix, Arizona to Mary Buckner and Thomas Smith Kelland. He graduated from The Westminster School, Stanford University and the Wharton School of Business and went to work for Citibank, where he spent his entire career. He served on Citicorp's Policy committee and was in charge of Investment Banking activities for South America and Japan/Australia until his retirement in 1990.
