        ADLER--Susan Seidenberg. February 27, 1956 to October 9, 2005. Daughter of the late Jerry and Gloria Seidenberg. Beloved wife of Richard Adler. Loving and devoted mother of Jacob Thomas and Leah Rose Adler. Treasured sister of Jane Seidenberg. Best friend to Biscuit & Misty. Susan was a life long resident of Rockville Centre and she leaves many friends, all of whom helped and supported Sue in a million ways. Susan worked for more than 15 years as a part of the AIDS Care Team at the NUMC, and she leaves many friends and colleagues there. Susan's life was all about taking care of those who needed a little extra help, starting with small animals when she was a kid and continuing through to becoming an RN. Her death leaves a hole in all our lives that will never be filled but we will feel her presence in every colorful sunset, in the flowers in her garden and in the spirit of her beautiful children. Funeral service will be Tuesday 4 PM, ''Gutterman's Inc.'', 175 Long Beach Road, Rockville Centre, L.I.
