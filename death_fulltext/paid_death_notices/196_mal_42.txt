        GUFF-Arthur. Patient, caring, deeply loved husband of Muriel Seltzer, adored godfather of Susan Simon Malach and step-father of Dr. Barbara J. Seltzer. The embodiment of selflessness, as reflected in his 38 year career as a criminal attorney with the Legal Aid Society of NYC, where he retired in 1995, his service as a distinguished professor in the law department of St. Johns University and his active participation as a member of the Democratic Party in Queens. Arthur loved the performing arts as evidenced by his contributions as a patron to the Met, City Center and Roundabout Theater. His generosity and sense of humor will live on through all who knew him. The memory of his warm smile, dignity and gentle nature will remain with us forever. Arthur will never be forgotten. Funeral services will be held Tuesday, 12:30 PM, at the Boulevard-Riverside Chapels, 1450 Bway, Hewlett, NY. Contributions in his memory may be made to Memorial Sloan-Kettering at 1275 York Ave, NYC 10021.
