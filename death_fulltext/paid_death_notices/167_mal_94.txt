        MARCUS-Leonard. Yeshiva University and its Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology are saddened by the passing of a dear friend, beloved husband of Adele. An eminent entrepreneur and highly respected leader of the Jewish community, he was a founding member of the FGS Board of Governors and-with his late first wife, Murial-a YU Guardian and Fellow of our affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary. They established FGS' Leonard and Murial Marcus Family Project for the Study of the Disturbed Adolescent, which has supported the fellowships of hundreds of students and advanced research in a vital area. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Adele; children, Peter and John; grandchildren; and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
