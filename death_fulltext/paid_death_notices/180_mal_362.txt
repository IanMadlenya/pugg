        LEVENSON-Larry. Larry Levenson's family, with great pain, must tell you of his tragic death on January 24, 2002. Larry was one of the best, nicest people who ever lived. His career in advertising was brilliant, his many other writings were sharp, insightful, full of love and humor. But the magic was in his love of family, of friends, of community, of his joy of simply being with others. He shared his wit and wisdom and compassion wherever he was welcome, and he was welcomed everywhere. He leaves behind his wonderfully strong and devoted wife Davida, his children Alan and Hilary, Laura and Jay, Lee and Kate, Mark and Holly, his grandchildren Indy, Billy, Ben, Emmy, Annie, Tyler, Brian and Austin, a long string of cousins, his brother Bob and sister-in-law Kathe. In a prescient moment, Larry wrote, ''I'll miss me when I'm gone.'' You said it, brother. A memorial service will be held on Sunday, January 27th, 1:30PM at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 21 West Broad St., Mt. Vernon, NY.
