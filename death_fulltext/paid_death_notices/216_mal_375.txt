        McCORMACK -- George H. The Department of Medicine of Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons is saddened by the loss of George H. McCormack, M.D. He spent the entirety of his long and rich career as a member of the Department of Medicine, earning his M.D. at P&S, training as intern and resident, and becoming Chief Resident in 1953. He was in practice for 52 years before his retirement in 2002. He will be remembered as an outstanding clinician, a wonderful colleague and an effective teacher of students and house officers. He brought his tremendous warmth, deep intellect and wide ranging interests to the care of patients and in so doing epitomized, for all who knew him, the ideals of internal medicine. The Robert A. Savitt and George H. McCormack Award is given each year to a graduating medical student who exemplifies his medical skill, consideration, understanding, and compassion. We send our deepest condolences to his family. David A. Brenner, M.D., Chair Katherine G. Nickerson, M.D., Vice Chair Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons
        McCORMACK -- George H., Jr., M.D. George gave us much more than good health. He gave us care, humor, fidelity, and love. He had no patients, only friends. We shall miss him terribly. His Devoted and Grateful Friends
