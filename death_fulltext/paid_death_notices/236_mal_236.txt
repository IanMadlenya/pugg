        WADLER--Herman E. Herman Wadler, the last surviving founder of the Wadler Bros. Inc, building supply center of Fleischmanns, New York, passed away Tuesday morning at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. He was 76 years old and had started the family business in 1959 with his older brothers, Bernard Wadler and Arthur Wadler. A lifelong skier and gardener, Herman Wadler was an outspoken defender of the economic and environmental interests of the Catskills, where he spent his life. He was a member for over 50 years of the Fleischmanns Volunteer Fire Department: a member of the Coalition to Save Belleayre Ski Center; the treasurer for 30 years of the Pine Hill-Fleischmanns Rotary Club; and a vigorous opponent of watershed regulations in the Catskills. His wife, Shirley Wadler, passed away in 2001. He is mourned by his children, Jason Wadler; Lisa Wadler; Steven Wadler and his wife Karen; and grandson Alex Wadler; as well as the many nephews and nieces he taught to swim, ski, and bike. In lieu of flowers and in recognition of his love of his community, the family asks that donations be made to your local fire department.
