        MAZUR-Abraham. The Faculty and Staff of the Chemistry Department of the City College of New York deeply regret the loss of our former Chair and colleague, Professor Abraham Mazur. Professor Mazur, an outstanding biochemist and a recognized authority in the area of hemoglobin, ferritin and iron metabolism, was also noted for the introduction of biochemistry into the undergraduate curriculum. Professor Mazur was held in high regard by his students and colleagues, and they will miss him. At this very difficult time, we extend our condolences and sympathy to his children, Ellen and Stephen.
