        SIEGEL-Rabbi Charles W. We record with profound sadness the passing of our beloved colleague. After making aliyah in 1968, he did pioneering work for the Conservative/Masorti Movement in Israel for over 30 years, serving as founding rabbi of Congregation Moriah in Haifa. We express our deepest condolences to his children, Daniel and Dr. David, and to all who were touched through his rabbinate. Rabbi Vernon H. Kurtz, Pres. Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Exec. VP The Rabbinical Assembly
