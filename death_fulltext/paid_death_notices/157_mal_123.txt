        ROSEMAN-Ronald. The Juilliard School deeply mourns the death of Ronald Roseman, a member of the School's faculty since 1982. A brilliant oboist, creative composer and arranger, dedicated teacher and coach, and caring human being, he was a greatly respected member of the Juilliard community. As the oboist of the New York Woodwind Quintet, in residence at the School since 1987, he and his colleagues developed one of the finest chamber music programs for woodwinds in the United States. We express our condolences to his wife Okkyu, and his entire family. Mary Rodgers Guettel, Chairman Joseph W. Polisi, President
