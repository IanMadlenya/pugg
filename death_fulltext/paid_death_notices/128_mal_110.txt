        JACOBS-Jerry C., M.D. ColumbiaPresbyterian Medical Center mourns the passing of our esteemed colleague, Dr. Jerry Jacobs. Dr. Jacobs was a renowned authority on juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and epitomized commitment to and care for children. A worldwide lecturer, he frequently spoke on diseases of the connective tissue in children and on pediatric rheumatoid arthritis. An author, he wrote the definitive textbook, ''Pediatric Rheumatology for the Practitioner.'' A leader and teacher, he was Professor of Clinical Pediatrics at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons; Attending Physician and Head of Pediatric Rheumatology at Babies & Children's Hospital; Pediatrician-in-Chief at the Edward Daniels Faulkner Arthritis Clinic of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center; and Center Director of the Regional Arthritis Program for Children (RAP for Kids). His commitment to improving the lives of children was unsurpassed, his work as a scholar and clinician was brilliant and his research was invaluable to the world's understanding of pediatric rheumatology. We will treasure his memory and work, and we will deeply miss his presence. William T. Speck, MD, President and Chief Executive Officer, The Presbyterian Hospital Herbert Pardes, MD V.P. for Health Sciences and Dean, Faculty of Medicine at Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons
