        BACOT -- J. Carter. The Trustees, the President and the entire Hamilton College community mourn the passing of our former Chairman of the Board and Life Trustee. Also the former Chairman and CEO of The Bank of New York, he was a loving husband and father, a wonderful benefactor and a loyal alumnus. We are indebted to his inspired leadership of his alma mater, including service as Chairman from 1990 to 1994. Our deepest sympathy is extended to his wife, Shirley, and their two daughters, Betsy and Susan, both of whom also graduated from Hamilton.
