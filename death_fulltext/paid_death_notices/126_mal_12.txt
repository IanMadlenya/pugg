        SCHWARTZ-Ludwig. We deeply mourn the passing of our longtime friend Lou, for more than forty years, who struggled courageously with cancer for many years. He was a devoted husband to his wife Francesca and a loving father to Robert, Monica and Valerie. With deep sorrow, we extend our condolences to a rare and unique individual who touched the hearts of so many persons. May the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Norman Greenberg and Family
