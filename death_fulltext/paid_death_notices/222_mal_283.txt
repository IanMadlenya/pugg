        SOMMER--Rudolph. Loving husband of Evelyn, father of Peter, Cathy, and Timothy, grandfather, brother, and uncle, died peacefully on July 24, 2005 in Stamford, Connecticut. Born in Lemberg, Poland (now Lvov, Ukraine) in 1925, he was graduated from City College, CUNY; Brooklyn Law School; and the Palmer School of Library Science. A veteran of WWII, he practiced law for forty years, after which he became a dedicated teacher at the University of Bridgeport, where he was scheduled to teach in the fall. His worldly goods were his family, his books, and music. He was an enthusiastic, but noncompetitive tennis player, attentive sports fan, and lively actor in community theater. He was a uniquely selfless human being. For service details, call Leo P. Gallagher & Son Funeral Home at 203-327-1313.
