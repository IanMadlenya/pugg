        PHIPPS-Ogden. The Board of Trustees and employees of the New York Racing Association honor the memory of one of its founders and trustees emeritus. Mr. Phipps was a member and past chairman of The Jockey Club & a former chairman of Bessemer Securities Corporation. His famed black silks with cherry cap will always be remembered along with his great homebred, thoroughbred champions such as Buckpasser, Easy Goer and the undefeated Personal Ensign. He won three Breeders' Cup races and owned and bred nine champion horses that won ten titles among them. His greatest thrill in racing was winning the Belmont Stakes in 1989 with Easy Goer. He won Eclipse Awards as the nation's leading breeder and owner in 1988 and repeated as top owner in 1989. His contributions to racing live on and will continue to have a positive impact on the sport for decades to come. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to his family. Barry K. Schwartz, Chairman and CEO Terence Blair Meyocks, President and COO
