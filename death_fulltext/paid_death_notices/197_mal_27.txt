        MARSHALL--Burke. Chair of the Vera Institute of Justice from its founding until 1987 and active trustee until he was elected chair emeritus in 2002. A model leader and a wise advisor for generations of trustees, staff, colleagues, and students. Burke shaped the Vera Institute; he helped assure the success of its projects to open doors for some of the most neglected memebers of society and to improve the administration of justice for all. He was a practical innovator and a moral force, who knew the struggle for equal justice would remain urgent for all time. We deeply mourn his death. Frederick A.O. Schwarz, Jr., Chair Christopher Stone, President >>AD#
