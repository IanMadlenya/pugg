        GINSBERG - William. The Board of Directors and staff of Citizens Housing and Planning Council deeply mourn the passing of our admired colleague and friend. His integrity, intelligence and pragmatism provided infallible guidance to CHPC for more than four decades. Bill taught us all that protection of our natural and historic resources need not come at the expense of economic development and social progress. We send heartfelt condolences to Bill's wife, Arlene, his sons, Mark and Joshua, and their families. Marvin Markus, President
