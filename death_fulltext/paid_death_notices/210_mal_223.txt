        HUNT--David J. David died on July 21, 2004 in Oakland, CA of a short devastating illness. A memorial service will be held at St. Mark's Cathedral, Seattle on Wednesday, July 28, 2004 at 10A.M. He was an indispensable presence in the lives of us who cared about music, golf, wit, reading, erudition, comradeship, the real thing and the right stuff. At Orpheus Remarkable Recordings in NYC and at Don Sherwood Golf in San Francisco, his clients became his friends. He was a rare spirit - the rarest. Godspeed, old friend. Wait for me on the next tee; I'll be along before you know it. MMT
