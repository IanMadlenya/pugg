        COAKLEY-Virginia McPike. Died gracefully on July 27, 2001, after a long illness. The Larchmont resident was preceded in death by her sister, Gracemarie M. Neville, and her brothers, Edward J. and Frank R. McPike. She proudly served as a Women Airforce Service Pilot (WASP) during World War II. Of the more than 20,000 women who applied for training, fewer than 2,000 were accepted and 1074 won their wings as WASPs. She maintained her pilot's license after the War, and she campaigned for Veterans status for the WASPs which was finally authorized by Congress in 1979. Virginia is survived by 10 nieces and nephews.
