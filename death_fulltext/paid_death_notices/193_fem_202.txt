        MEYERS-Edna. We mourn the passing of our beloved ''Nanny''. Her mission in life was devotion to her adoring family, who are a living testament to her boundless love and caring. The epitome of grace and beauty for 91 years, she was our source of strength in both joyous & tragic times. Devoted wife of the late Maxwell, loving & proud mother of twins Harriette Rose Katz and Renee (Jerry) Bernheim, grandmother of Trisha Bernheim, Claudia and Jonathan Warner, Doug Bernheim and Susie Flax and Melissa and Lawrence Rosenbloom, and greatgrandmother of six precious children. Loving sister to Esther Shaber, and Lillie and the late Bernard Berger. None of us, and none who knew her, will ever be the same. We will adore you always, Nan. Services Wednesday 11 AM at ''The Riverside'' 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue.
        MEYERS-Edna. She was a woman of monumental strength of character, whose shining spirit inspired and will continue to inspire her family and all those who had the privilege of knowing her. Her devotion to family, warmth, love, loyalty and compassion will live on in her daughters, her grandchildren and her great grandchildren. We mourn with and send our love, support and heartfelt sympathy to her bereaved family. Jean, Peter, Andrea & Laura
