        SULAM-Edna. The Officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Edna Sulam, beloved mother of our dedicated leader and dear friend, Carol Zicklin. Devoted to strengthening the Jewish community for future generations, Carol is the volunteer coordinator of the Jewish introduction service, Links, and is a trustee of the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, a beneficiary agency of UJA-Federation. We offer our sincerest condolences to Carol and her husband, Lawrence, a dedicated board member and former campaign chair of UJA-Federation; to Mrs. Sulam's husband, Gabriel; her son, Donald; her four grandchildren; and her five great-grandchildren.
