        ZUCKERBERG--Ruth. We celebrate the memory of Ruth Zuckerberg, Surah Ruchal, a vibrant, artistic, intense and charismatic woman. She inspired so many as she actively engaged with life -drawing, sculpting, reading, exercising, learning Hebrew and French, and enjoying theater and classical music. She is dearly missed by her daughter Alice, granddaughter Jen, and grandson Kevin.
