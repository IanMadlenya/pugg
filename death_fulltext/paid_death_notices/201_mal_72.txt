        POSTMAN--Neil. The Faculty of the Steinhardt School of Education at New York University deeply mourn the loss of Neil Postman, our beloved colleague and founder of our program in Media Ecology, longtime Chair of the Department of Culture and Communication. Neil was an education reformer, humanist, social visionary, media critic who developed a wide audience for his writing and speaking. Our professor for nearly 40 years, a mentor to hundreds of students and dozens of faculty, a story teller and man of wisdom, and a dear friend to many. He wrote more than 20 books, among them Teaching as a Subversive Activity, Amusing Ourselves to Death, The Disappearance of Childhood, and Technopoly. He was named University Professor in 1993 and the Paulette Goddard Professor of Media Ecology in 1998; he received the University's Distinguished Teaching Medal in 1988. He will be sorely missed. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Shelley, and his three children, Mark, Andrew, and Madeline.
