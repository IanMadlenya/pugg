        WILLIAMS-Clayton. The Center for Alternative Sentencing and Employment Services mourns the passing of our dear friend, colleague and trustee. For over 20 years, Clayton worked tirelessly to set up and maintain a community service sentencing program, dedicated to helping poor, non-violent criminal offenders. Clayton made genuinely deep and personal connections; his calm and good humored presence made his friends and colleagues feel happy and valued. Clayton emerged from his earlier life, which was filled with danger and hardship with a generous and kind spirit. We love him and will always remember him.
        WILLIAMS-Clayton. The staff and Trustees of the Vera Institute of Justice mourn the death of our long time colleague and friend, Clayton Williams. He inspired us with his formidable skills and boundless good will. He helped build programs, and he led others toward constructive lives. He could mesmerize a work crew of ex-offenders, a bus load of Princeton students touring the South Bronx, an adult education class at Marymount College or a team of judges and prosecutors at Brandeis University. We treasure his life.
