        LIPPER-George. The officers, leadership, and staff of UJAFederation of New York mourn the passing of George Lipper. His son, Kenneth Lipper, is a devoted friend and supporter of UJA-Federation and an active leader in the Jewish philanthropic community. His wife, Evelyn, shares his devotion to Jewish communal leadership. We extend our deepest sympathies to Kenneth; his daughters-in-law, Evelyn and Binnette; his brother, Milton, his grandchildren, Allen, Joanna, Daniella, Tamara, and Julie; and the entire family. May you be consoled among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Larry A. Silverstein, Board Chair Louise B. Greilsheimer, President Stephen D. Solender, Exec. V.P.
