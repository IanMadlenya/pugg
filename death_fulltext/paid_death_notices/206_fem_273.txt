        WOLFE--Hilda. 1910-2004. Our beloved mom died Saturday evening. She was wife of 65 years to Dr. Milton Wolfe. She was a lifelong inspiration to her three children, Allan, Robert and Wendy, and their spouses, Susan Wolfe, Jill Wolfe and Paul Goldberg, and loved by her surviving brother Phillip Savage. Her 15 grandchildren shared years of love, laughter and learning with her, and nine greatgrandchildren will learn more of her beauty and verve through the years. Her accomplishments were many but her greatest legacy of all is her adoring family. Hilda's vibrant spirit will always be a role model for all whose lives she touched. Beseme Mucho, Mom.
