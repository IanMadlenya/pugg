        AYBAR--Ivonne. The family of Ivonne de Lepervanche Aybar sadly announce her peaceful death, in her home, in her sleep, in the early morning of Saturday, April 30. Mrs. Aybar, born June 7, 1919, in Santo Domingo of ancestry both Spanish and French, was for many years in the 1940s singles, doubles, and mixed doubles tennis champion of the Dominican Republic. Her father Rene Mezieres de Lepervanche had founded La Opinion, the leading newspaper in Santo Domingo until 1945 when it was finally discontinued. She moved with her husband Francisco Aybar, also a notable and decorated tennis champion, to New York in the mid-40s, where they soon came to reside in Forest Hills. She is survived, with immense love, gratitude and glorious memories, by her only son Francisco Aybar, the pianist; her grandchildren Samuel Rene Aybar of North Salem, NY, and Elizabeth Dina Aybar of Denver, CO. Also surviving her are Sam's family, Susie Aybar and their child, (Mrs. Aybar's greatgrandson Benjamin). Surviving her as well, are her cousin/almost sister Rebeca Galvan of Forest Hills and her niece Lily Estella of Bloomfield Hills, MI. Her astonishing energy, kindness and utterly wacky personality will be profoundly missed by many who loved her deeply: in both of the large families, spread through several countries, on her side and that of her late distinguished husband, as well as by many friends and associates who were proud to know her anywhere. A memorial is being held Tuesday, May 3, at 6 PM, at Fox Funeral Home, Ascan Ave. and Metropolitan Ave. in Forest Hills. In lieu of flowers, the family request that donations be sent to the North Shore Animal League America, 16 Lewyt Street, Port Washington, NY 11050, attention Planned Giving/Ivonne Aybar Fund.
