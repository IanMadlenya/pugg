        RAY--William, 72, beloved husband of Madeline, devoted father of Tiernan and Claudia, fond father-in-law of Peter Zinman, adoring grandfather of Max Zinman, died Friday, January 26, 2007, in New York after a long illness. Bill was a gifted artist and computer whiz who loved silly jokes, action movies, sushi, oyster pan roasts, vintage port, St. Tropez, and suprising Max with yet another wooden train or plastic dinosaur for his collections. We miss him terribly.
