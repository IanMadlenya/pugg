        SCHIFFMAN--Donald. Beloved husband of Carol, father of Steven, father-inlaw to Susan and grandfather to Rebecca; died peacefully at age 83 on December 12, 2004. Born in the Bronx, he built a successful retail business while bringing reason and logic in an illogical world. As an active fundraiser, he generously gave his time to support the United Jewish Appeal. We will miss you very much. A Memorial Service will be held Sunday at Temple Beth-Shalom in Boca Raton, Florida.
