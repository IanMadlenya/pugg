        LAWRENCE-Lewis R., M.D., 92. Died on Friday, 20 December, although to us, he was not mortal. Devoted and adored husband to Florence, cherished father to Lynn and Jeff, and their spouses Glenda and Michael. His love of photography transformed into a life-long love affair with radiology, he was privileged to work until his 90th birthday. For half a century, as Associate Clinical Professor of Radiology at NYU Medical Center, and most recently as staff radiologist at St. Joseph's and Director of Radiology at Creedmoor, thousands of patients and legions of medical residents benefited from his laser-like diagnostic readings. There was no finer, kinder, doctor. Cher Papa, s'arrive, enfin. Services Sunday, 22 December, at 1 PM, at RiversideNassau North Chapels, 55 North Station Plaza, Great Neck, NY. Donations may be made to a charity of your choice.
