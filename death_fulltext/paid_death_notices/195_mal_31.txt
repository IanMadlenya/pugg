        KALMUS-Geoffrey M. Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP regrets the death of one of our firm's founding partners, Geoffrey M. Kalmus, who died last night at home in Albuquerque, NM. From the time our firm was formed in 1968 to the day he retired in 1993, Geoff was our natural leader and everyone's first source of good counsel. He was the sounding board for any difficult ethical or practice issue that arose. He was the one to build consensus and to offer direction on issues that mattered. Geoff's voice was heard because its source was selfless: he always viewed an issue from the perspective of what was best for the firm, no matter its effect on him personally. His intellect, analytical skills and judgment were towering. He was a mentor to many of us: vigilant and vigorous in the prosecution of his clients' views, meticulous and scholarly in his legal advocacy, and honest and just in the positions he took. That our beloved GMK-quirky, eccentric, unique-has died is a great loss to the firm and the lawyers that he mentored.
