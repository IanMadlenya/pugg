        GALLER--Beatrice. Hadassah, The Women's Zionist Organization of America, Inc. remembers a dear friend and colleague Bea Galler. Bea was a cherished wife of the late William Galler, and the beloved mother of Lynne and Marc Perry, of blessed memory. As a member of the Society of Major Donors, she was a generous benefactor of Hadassah, devoted to Israel and the Jewish people. Her legacy lives on through the programs she supported at the Hadassah Medical Organization. She is deeply missed by all who knew her. June Walker National President
