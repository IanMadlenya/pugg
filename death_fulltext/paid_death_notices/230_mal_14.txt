        $(6$)BENTON -- Nicholas. New York City Opera notes with sadness the passing of our good friend, Nick Benton. As a patron and a long-time volunteer, Nick supported the company in countless ways. As President of our Volunteer Corps, he conducted backstage tours and greeted patrons during rehearsals. He ran our gift shop during performances and created and produced a newsletter for our volunteers, as well as assisting staff members. He was a City Opera devotee, introducing many of his friends and colleagues to the company. He was always ready to help, and his enthusiasm cheered us all. His passing leaves a void in our midst, and we will miss him. The company extends its deepest sympathies to his wife Kitty, his family, and his many friends. Paul Kellogg General Director
