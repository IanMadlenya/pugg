        HOWE-Robert. It is with deep sorrow that we bid farewell to our friend and esteemed colleague, Robert Howe, who passed away on Friday, July 16th, 1999. Bob first started in the futures industry in the 1970's having worked for Lincoln Staley, Prudential Bache and Monroe Trout. Bob was a wonderful mentor who was renowned for his market savvy and his wit. We were fortunate to have worked with Bob for six years and he will be sadly missed by everyone.
