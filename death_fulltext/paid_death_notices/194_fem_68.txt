        MITTLEMANN-Ady. March 9, 2003. Although we do not see your face, your smile, your eyes, Your beauty and grace cast about the heavens and skies. Do not worry our dear friend, There is no such thing as an end. You will go on and live amongst the great, Who steadily watch over those of great fate. Do not go quietly into the night, We dare you! Charge the heavens with all your might! Although at this moment we are crushingly dismayed, Memories in our hearts and minds will never be overplayed. With your fashion, attitude, and encyclopedia-like mind, You have undeniably attested to be one of a kind. So we say to you, all hugged and kissed, GO EASY into the night, you will be eternally missed. Her husband, David and her family will be having a private service.
