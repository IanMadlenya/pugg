        KARNES-Irma Shongut. I want to express my profound sadness at the death of my great aunt Irma. Born December 11, 1912 and died November 30, 1997. She was very special to me. I will miss the warmth, affection and kindness she has always shown me. I will remember her always with love. Michele Eva Enzer
