        BRAVER--Charles, 63, died November 15, 2006, at home, after a fierce battle against melanoma. For the past 10 years, Charles was a teacher in the CUNY Language Immersion Program at NYC College of Technology and had a deep commitment to the students whom he guided and empowered through language and culture. The Charles Braver Scholarship Fund has been established to aid CLIP graduates to continue their studies in the CUNY system. Charles is survived by his beloved wife Jill of 32 years, his devoted daughters Megen and Rachel, lifelong friend Cathleen Julian (mother of Megen), sonin-law Rick Tyler, delightful twin grandchildren, Keegan and Kensie Tyler, sister-inlaw Michelle Seligson, and his nephews and nieces John Friedman and Kathy Friedman, Jon Seltzer and Sally Seltzer. We will miss his generosity of spirit, his intellect, his humor, his tenacity and his sense of outrage at hypocrisy and unfairness. A celebration of his life will be held at a later date. To support the scholarship, please send contributions to: The Charles Braver Scholarship Fund, Attn: Ramon Tercero, 6th Floor, Office of Academic Affairs, CUNY, 535 East 80th St., New York, NY 10021. Checks should be made out to the Research Foundation of The City of New York, with subject line: Charles Braver Scholarship Fund.
