        CITRIN--Hillary. Hillary, it has been several years since last I wrote and I would like to let you know what has gone on in our family since then. Your nephew Ethan still has a heart of gold but now it is in the body of a young man. He is handsome and smart and beautiful as you were. Your nephew Hunter is a great athlete and has your sense of humor. You and he would have had a great time together. Luanne is still keeping me together after all these years. And Dad continues to be the strength that he was when you were with us. Luckily for us, his wife, Roz, keeps him well. It has been 23 years and it feels like it was yesterday when I saw you last. All my love, Marc
