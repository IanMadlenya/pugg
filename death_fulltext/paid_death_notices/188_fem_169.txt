        KARCHMAR - BOEHM - An na. Born in Warsaw, Poland on July 30, 1906, passed away on September 24. She was the loving wife of Herman Boehm, widow of Stephan Karchmar, devoted mother to Robert Karchmar, and mother-in-law to Yosefa Klein-Karchmar and Sylvia Karchmar. She was the matriarch of her family around the world: Vivian Pires of Brazil, the Bermans of Australia, the Dorits of Mexico, and the Karczmars. To countless other friends, including Irena Starzec, bound into Anna's family by love, she was a teacher, mentor, inspiration and confidante; a charismatic and proud woman whose fierce spirit, humor, and determination moved both people and mountains. To granddaughters Lara Karchmar and Dorian KarchmarKotzin, great-grandsons Benjamin and Dylan Orr, and many ''young-people'' who adopted her over the years, she was, simply, Nana: Grande-Dame in furs and pearls; fearless reprimander of any table or chair leg foolish enough to stub a small toe; extravagant giver of cherished heirlooms and words of wisdom, of glamorous memories, traditions and home-cooked meals. A born diplomat, elegant in every possible sense of the word, hostess extraordinaire, a charmer with a backbone of steel, she set the standard for generosity and spirit. She was a Holocaust survivor, fluent in five languages, who had lived in Warsaw, Paris, London, Rio de Janeiro, and New York. Her unerring sense of style and beauty translated themselves into a career in fur and jewelry design, and the fine arts. She created around her a unique atmosphere that imprinted itself on all who knew her. Her absence will leave a perpetual void in our hearts. Services at 11:00AM Friday, September 27, at Riverside Memorial Chapel. In lieu of flowers, contributions to Doctors Without Borders would be appreciated.
