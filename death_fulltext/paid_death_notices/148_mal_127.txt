        LEE-Man Bun. M.B. Lee will be sadly missed by his many friends at NYU Downtown Hospital. A passionate advocate of accessible healthcare for the people of New York's Chinese community, he was a valued advisor to the Hospital's Board of Trustees and senior management on ways to reach those people in greatest need. Mr. Lee was a devoted supporter of the Hospital's campaign to rebuild its emergency room, graciously attending many important meetings on the project and traveling great distances to meet with potential supporters. He will be remembered as much for his intelligence, wit and charm as for his devotion to his community. The Board of Trustees, senior management and the staff of NYU Downtown Hospital mourn the passing of this exceptional man. Nelson Schaenen, Jr. Chairman of the Board Leonard A. Aubrey President and Chief Exec. Officer NYU Downtown Hospital
