        TISCH -- Laurence Alan. SHALVA-The Center for Mentally and Physically Challenged Children in Israel mourns the passing of Mr. Laurence Alan Tisch, a pillar of Jewish communal life for decades. He merited to live a long, full life and to establish a legacy of extraordinary 'chesed' -loving kindness, that he not only practiced but also instilled so masterfully in his children and grandchildren. He was viewed with the utmost esteem by all who knew him and was a true giant of the spirit. He led by example in his modest personal life as well as in his successful business life. A true American, he epitomized the finest qualities of an American Jewish businessman, whose humility was instructive to many, and whose winning record was legendary, equaled only by his philanthropy in New York City, at NYU and its Hospital, its children's zoo, his beloved Metropolitan Museum, and reaching overseas to the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo, the Moshe Dayan Archeological Collection, and countless other worthy institutions. We express our profound and deepest sympathy to his beloved wife, Billie, and to his children, Andrew, Daniel, our committed friend and dedicated SHALVA board member James, and Thomas, his brother, Bob, and wife, Joan, and to the entire Tisch family. His legacy lives on in the sterling qualities exhibited by his family. ''May you be comforted amongst all other mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.'' As Mr. Tisch provided respite during his life to hundreds of families with handicapped and special needs children serviced by SHALVA, we pray that he now has eternal respite and peace, as his most deserved, and earned, reward. Nathan Low, Hillel Weinberger, Leon Wagner, Rabbi Kalman Samuels, and the entire Board of Directors of the American Friends of SHALVA.
