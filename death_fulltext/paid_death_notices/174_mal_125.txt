        BLAU-Edward L. The American Jewish Committee is profoundly saddened by the death of Edward Blau, a treasured friend and devoted member for nearly 50 years. Bud served AJC as a member of our National Board of Governors, Budget Committee, Domestic Policy Committee and as past president of our Metro New Jersey Chapter. His indefatigable humanity, generosity, wisdom and love for the Jewish community guided him in support of AJC's bold and innovative efforts to bring people of different faiths and ethnicities together in a bond of mutual respect and understanding. He was an inspired and gifted leader, and we were proud to honor him with our National Human Relations Award in 1995. We send our heartfelt condolences to his wife Barbara, his sons Charles and Robert and his entire family. Harold Tanner, President David A. Harris, Executive Dir. Shulamith Bahat, Assoc. Exec. Dir.
