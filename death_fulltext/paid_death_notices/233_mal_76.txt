        AZRIELOWICZ - Ephraim. The Yeshiva University family is saddened by the passing in Israel of the beloved brother of our Trustee and Benefactor, David J. (and Stephanie) Azrieli for whom the Azrieli Graduate School of Jewish Education and Administration is named. A retired metallurgical engineer who lived in Israel since 1947, Mr. Azrielowicz is survived by his sons, Mordecai and Aryeh, and by his five grandchildren and five great grandchildren. Heartfelt condolences are extended to all the members of the Azrieli family, who we pray will be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel, President Norman Lamm, Chancellor Morry J. Weiss, Chairman, Board of Trustees David J. Schnall, Dean Azrieli Graduate School of Jewish Education and Administration
