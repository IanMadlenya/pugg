        POE-Frances T. The Inwood House Trustees, staff and friends mourn the loss of our colleague and dear friend Frances T. Poe. Greatly loved and admired for her generosity, determination and intellect, for 40 years Frances Poe was a driving force in insuring the integrity of Inwood House and the well being of the young people we serve. Services will be held today at The Riverside Church, 120th Street and Riverside Drive at 2PM. The family requests that gifts in honor of Mrs. Poe be made to Inwood House, 320 East 82 Street, New York, New York 10028.
