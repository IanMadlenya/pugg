        KAPLAN-Donald Roy. God's Love We Deliver honors the memory of our dear friend, Donald Roy Kaplan. Donald was a person of caring and conviction, with a gift for analysis and a quick wit, whose contributions spanned the history of God's Love We Deliver. From encouraging and advising our founder, to joining the Board of Directors in 1994 and becoming our Treasurer in 1995, he greatly helped us in our work of feeding homebound men, women and children living with AIDS. We are deeply grateful for Donald's guidance and we will miss him. Richard E. Feldman, Board Chair Kathy Spahn, Executive Director
