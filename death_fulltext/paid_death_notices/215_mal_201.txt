        FISHER--Richard B. On behalf of the board of trustees and staff of Carnegie Corporation of New York, we celebrate the life of Richard Fisher whose wise counsel and many contributions informed the work of the corporation. During his years of service to Carnegie Corporation, Mr Fisher's professional insites from the financial world helped guide his work as chairman of our investment committee where he grew the endowment significantly and led the corporation to become an international investor. But it was Dick's fulsome view of the world, and his enthusiasm for learning and knowledge that marked his tenure with us. We offer sincere condolences to his family and his wife Jeanne. Helene L.
