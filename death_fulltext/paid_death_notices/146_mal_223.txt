        STRAX-Philip. A pioneer in the use of mammography and other screening techniques for the early detection of breast cancer died in his sleep on March 9, 1999. He was 90. Dr. Strax was the founder and director of the Guttman Institute in New York City and the Strax Institute in Fort Lauderdale, FL; both institutes were established as nonprofit centers for the early detection and prevention of breast cancer. In 1988, Dr. Strax received the Charles F. Kettering Prize from General Motors for his medical research which established the importance of early detection as a way to reduce death from breast cancer. He was also a published poet, an avid photographer, a 3-D movie creator, and a talented harmonica player. Dr. Strax survived his two wives, Bertha and Gertrude. Dr. Strax was loved by many, including his sister, Anne; six children, Norman, Rita, Polly, Marshall, Richard, and Gayle; eight grandchildren, Bonnie, Todd, Wayne, Jill, Daniel, Lauren, Adam, and Brandon; and one greatgrandson, Zachary, affectionately known as ''The Zak Man.''
