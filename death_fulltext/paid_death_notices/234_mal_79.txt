        ALLISON--Harry A. The Horace Mann School deeply mourns the passing of Harry Allison 1940, a respected student, helpful colleague, beloved friend and esteemed administrator at HM for over 45 years. His unwavering loyalty and support of the school and his unparalleled commitment to doing the right thing at all times made him an invaluable member of the community. Horace Mann students were the beneficiary of his wisdom, kindness, intellect, and exacting academic and moral standards. His efficient pragmatic style of leadership made it easy for those who worked alongside him and with him. It was a privilege to have such an accomplished and principled individual in our midst. Predeceased by the death of his beloved wife Eleanor, and his devoted son David, our heartfelt condolences are extended to his daughters Nancy, former HM Faculty member, and Anne, his son Paul and to the entire Allison family. His remarkable presence will be remembered. Dr. Thomas M. Kelly Head of School Steven M. Friedman 1972 Chair, Board of Trustees
