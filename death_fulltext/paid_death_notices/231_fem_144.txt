        SPIRA--Toni dies at 101. Loving wife of the late Lazar Spira, devoted mother of Dr. Sidney Spira, dearest motherin-law to Annelene Spira, she died on April 17 peacefully at home in the arms of her caregiver for the last 10 years, Tessie Garcia. Toni was born 1904 in Berlin, Germany, where she grew up, married Lazar Spira and had their son Sidney. At the begin of the Nazi era they moved to London, and had to endure the bombs of the ''Blitzkrieg''. Barbados seemed a safe haven and they made their home there, embracing the lifestyle of the tropics. After Sidney finished his studies at Columbia U., they followed him to New York City, their last stop in moving around the world. Toni and Lazar loved to travel and made friends easily. They had a close-knit family life, enjoyed theater, family gatherings and a wonderful circle of friends. On her 100th birthday Toni enjoyed reading congratulatory letters from the Mayor of Berlin, Germany, the British Consulate, the Governor of Barbados, Mayor Bloomberg and the President of the U.S. The passing of this extremely intelligent and life-loving woman fills all who knew her with great sorrow, but she left us with many happy memories and will live forever in our hearts.
