From her humble beginnings, she rose to become the CFO for 41 years of a successful multi national manufacturing company. She accomplished this with much wisdom, loyalty, integrity and lots of humor. She will be sorely missed by her children, William and Judy, Marlene and Paul and Joseph and Jackie, and her adored grandchildren Jonathan, Daniel, Rachel, Sofia, Harry, Sam, Laura, William and Sarah.
