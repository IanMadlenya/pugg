        BOLTON--Robert, emigre from South Africa and proud American citizen, died on December 17, 2006, at age 69. He began his New York career at The Asia Society, but devoted the final 25 years of his life to helping people with AIDS, early on at GMHC and then for the last 18 years at The Momentum Project, an AIDS service agency which provides strength, sustenance, and support to disenfranchised New Yorkers with HIV/ AIDS. Survived by his sister Dorothy Hillier and cousin Brian Bolton, both in South Africa, and devoted New York City friends Brad Doles, Frank Thompson, Jon Wicklund, and Arthur Coake. He will be fondly missed. Momentum will host a memorial gathering to celebrate Robert's 70th birthday and 40th anniversary in America at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington and 54th, at 6pm on Tuesday, January 30, 2007.
