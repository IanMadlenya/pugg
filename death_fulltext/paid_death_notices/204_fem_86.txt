        KIRCHGAESSNER -- Miriam (Mia) Rachel (nee Yoseloff). On January 6, 2004, suddenly, unexpectedly and tragically, we lost Mia forever. Throughout her 34 years of life, she was an inspiration to all who had the privilege of knowing her. A securities analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein, Mia was brilliant, loving, generous, vibrant and dedicated to family and career. She is sorely missed by her adoring husband, Rainer Kirchgaessner, her precious nine month old son, Alexander Russell, her mother Deborah Lakoff, father Mark Yoseloff, stepmother Patricia Yoseloff and his sisters Jill Schaeffer and Sarah Yoseloff. Her many relatives and friends are overwhelmed with grief. There is a great void in our lives filled only with sadness. Relatives and friends are invited to services Friday, January 9, 2004 at 1:00 pm at Joseph Levine & Son, 4737 Street Road, Trevose, PA. Interment Roosevelt Memorial Park. The family will return to the residence of Dr. John and Nancy Bennett. In lieu of flowers, the family requests memorial donations be made to the Miriam Rachel Yoseloff Kirchgaessner Charitable Foundation; c/o Harvey Spira, Bear Stearns & Co, 383 Madison Avenue, NY, NY 10179. www.levinefuneral.com
