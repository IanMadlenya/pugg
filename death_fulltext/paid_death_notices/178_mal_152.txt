        BURNSIDE-John Patrick. FDNY. Heroically died in the line of duty on September 11, 2001, in the World Trade Center attack. John was a three year veteran of the NYPD at Central Park Precinct. The last seven years he served as one of New York's bravest amongst his friends and comrades of Ladder 20. John was actively pursuing a promotion by preparing for the FDNY Lieutenant's exam while also representing his fellow fire fighters as the Union delegate at Ladder 20. John Burnside is survived by his forever loving wife Sandra, his parents William and Elizabeth Burnside, brother Robert and sister Ann Marie, and his adoring niece and nephews who thought there was no greater man in the world, Stephen, Mikey, Billy, Amanda, Jenna, Nicolette and Alexis. John will always be rememberd for his musical talent as he was an avid guitar player/musician/writer who strived for creativity and perfection. For his fanatical love of the Minnesota Vikings for which he took much abuse from his friends and fellow fire fighters at Ladder 20. For his dedication and commitment, studying every day to make Lieutenant so he could further make a difference in this city, for this I hope you knew how proud we were. John is and will always be dearly missed by all who were fortunate to have known him. He gave willingly every day to the City of New York as an upstanding citizen and proud fire fighter who was just realizing his potential. John, you were a hero to me everyday at home, now you're a hero to the world and we'll all be forever proud. You will forever be in all our hearts and prayers till we meet again.
