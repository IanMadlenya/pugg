        STEVENS-Carol J. Of New York City and East Hampton. Died on December 5 in New York-Cornell Hospital of ALS. Carol was a warm, insightful, giving person and a source of strength and support to her many friends. These traits also pervaded her professional life. After receiving an M.A. in education from the University of Massachusetts, she briefly taught school; but soon turned to social work as her career. She received an MSW from Fordham University and spent 25 years at St. Vincent's Services in Brooklyn, working first on the development of their Foster Boarding Program, and from 1980 to 1992, serving as Director of the Agency's Foster Care and Adoption Services. As the number of children served by St. Vincent's Services grew, she never lost sight of the individual entrusted to her care. Her Director's door was always open to those children and families in need of her counsel or intervention. Her friends will miss her caring nature, her ready response to their needs, her wise counsel and her fun-loving sense of humor. A gifted communicator and speaker, she was cruelly deprived of speech by her illness, but she adapted to the Internet to maintain contact with her friends and family, which was so important to her and to them. She showed immense bravery in the long course of her rare, incurable illness, fighting each day to maintain dignity and mastery of herself. She bore her illness without complaint or self-pity. Her caring extended to the plight of animals. She was an advocate for the protection of Carriage Horses in New York City. In her honor, donations may be made to the World Wildlife Fund, 1250 Twenty-Fourth St., NW, Washington, DC 20037. Carol leaves a brother, Dr. William Schwartz of Los Angeles; a niece, Laurie Schwartz, and nephew, Dr. Eric Schwartz of Boston; and dear friends Helen Morris, Ann Davis and Josh of New York City. A memorial service will be announced.
