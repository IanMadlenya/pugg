        SHABAZZ-Dr. Betty. The Professional Staff Congress of The City University of New York extends its profound sympathy to the family of our beloved colleague at Medgar Evers College, Dr. Betty Shabazz. Dr. Shabazz was a unique personality who brought the instructional staff together in a committed spirit of service to students and to their scholarly and professional contributions. Dr. Shabazz recently made a masterful presentation at the union's annual conference on women. Her passing removes a great and esteemed colleague from the City University community. Irwin H.
