        SEGALL--Joel. The entire Baruch College community mourns the loss of Baruch's former President, Joel Segall. President Segall served the College as its tireless champion, developing a master plan for the outstanding Library and Technology Center and the breathtaking new Vertical Campus, and attracting outstanding faculty, particularly to his beloved Zicklin School of Business. Tens of thousands of students have since enjoyed the fruits of those achievements. We extend our sympathy and condolences to his wife, Joan, and to the entire family. Ned Regan, President, Baruch College Dov Schlein, President, The Baruch College Fund
