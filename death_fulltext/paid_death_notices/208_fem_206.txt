        BLUMBERG--Kay Simmon. Born in Berlin in 1909, came to New York in 1926. Graduated from NYU. Worked first as a German translator, then, after studying with Berenice Abbott, became a professional photographer, specializing in children but picturing whatever else came before her lens, in her wide-ranging travels and her favorite subject, New York. Happily married to Mike Blumberg who predeceased. Hopefully now photographing the angels with her little ''dinkies.''
