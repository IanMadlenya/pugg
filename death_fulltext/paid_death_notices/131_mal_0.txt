        ASKIN-Michael. 45 years old, General Manager, Hampton Hills Golf & Country Club. It is with great sadness that we inform you of the passing of our General Manager, Michael Askin. Michael's courageous three-and-ahalf month fight with cancer ended at 4:30 AM on Sunday, November 30. Michael began his career in the golf business at Old Westbury Country Club. He then moved over to Indian Hills Country Club, and then to Nissequogue Golf Club, before moving east. Michael came to Hampton Hills in 1977, then known as North Hampton Golf Club. He covered every possible position in the golf business. He was the course Superintendent for three years before becoming the General Manager in 1980. His consistently mild demeanor and soft approach complemented his many skills which he handled with great aplomb. His co-workers reflect the honesty and loyalty that he exuded brightly. We will all miss him. Michael is survived by his wife Kathy, his daughters Jennifer and Nicole, his son Michael, Jr. and family. Services will be held at Sinneckson's Funeral Home at 203 Main Street in Center Moriches, (516) 878-0065. Visiting will be from 7 to 9 PM on Monday, December 1, and on Tuesday, December 2, from 2 to 4 PM and 7 to 9 PM. There will be a Mass on Wednesday, December 3, at 9:45 AM, at St. Judes in Mastic, NY.
