        FISHER-H. Ray passed away January 7, 2000 surrounded with love. He was born January 27, 1959 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Ray was an enormously talented man with an innate sense of style. He shared that gift through his work for a distinguished roster of clients including Macy's, Bloomingdale's, Rich's Atlanta, Turner Broadcasting, Viacom, and Neiman Marcus. He was also a beautiful human being inside and out. He was meticulous, insightful and a relentless perfectionist. He balanced it all with a mischievious sense of humor. He had a soft spot for children and animals, both of whom always gravitated toward him. His curiosity about people and places led him to travel the world. He soaked up beauty like a sponge wherever he went. He was profoundly affected by Bali which will be, in accordance with his wishes, his final resting place. Those who wish to make a gesture in his behalf may make a contribution to the ASPCA. Ray is survived by his mother, Bertha Cassler; sisters, Helen Wagner, June Kohl, Karen Winter, Kathy Marshall; brothers, Ronnie and Gary Cassler; and his extended family, Tyler, Harley, and John Thomas.
