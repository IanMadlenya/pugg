        HOFFMAN-Lynn Murphy. The families, faculty and administration of The Town School are deeply saddened by the death of Lynn Hoffman, wife of Bobby Hoffman and mother of sixth grader Ryan. Lynn was an active, supportive, and committed member of The Town School community, generously volunteering her time and talent to many school activities. Her strength and courage during her illness never faltered. She was a wonderful wife, mother and friend. Our sincerest sympathy goes out to the entire Murphy and Hoffman families.
