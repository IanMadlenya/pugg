        SAUNDERS-Dero Ames. 88. On May 22, 2002. Veteran financial writer who also edited works by Edward Gibbon and Theodor Mommsen. Born in Starkville, MS; B.A. Dartmouth, 1935; M.A. Columbia, 1937. During WWII he served in the State Department and afterwards joined Fortune. He moved to Forbes in 1960, serving as Executive Editor and in other capacities until 1998. Forbes Editor Emeritus James Michaels said, ''When we were stumped for an historical anecdote or an appropriate quote to make a story come alive, Dero came through. More than anyone I've known, he could put a business story into broad perspective.'' Many young reporters he hired and nurtured over lunches at The Players Club rose to prominence. He also served as Chairman of Dartmouth Magazine's Editorial Board and the college's Alumni Council. He was proudest of the Portable Gibbon, a 1951 edition of The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, in print for 40 years. Preceded in death by his son Dr. David N. Saunders, he is survived by his wife Beatrice Nair Saunders; his son Dr. Richard A. Saunders; two daughters-in-law, four grandchildren, and one greatgrandchild. Memorials to the Bishop Gadsden Fund, 1 Gadsden Way, Charleston, SC 29412.
