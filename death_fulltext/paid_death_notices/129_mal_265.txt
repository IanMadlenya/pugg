        WILLIAMS-Stanley. The entire School of American Ballet family notes with greatest sorrow the death of faculty member Stanley Williams. The entire faculty, all the stdents and staff join Chairman Albert C. Bellas, Faculty Chairman Peter Martins, and President Larry Alan Smith in mourning the loss of this extraordinary teacher. In his quiet, unpretentious way, he was one of the most influential ballet academicians of his era, and left his indelible mark on generations of American dancers.
