        WELLS -- Mildred Brenner. February 7, 1923-July 8, 2005. Beloved wife of 59 years of Carl F. Wells, who survives her, along with their children, Wendy Ellen and Nicholas Adam, and her grandson Richard Martin Wright, all of Mohegan Lake, NY. We will always carry you in our hearts, and our lives have been the richest because of you. Every minute of your life you took tireless care of everyone: your patients in your career as a clinical social worker, and your family. You never let us down, and you listened and counseled with compassion, acute insight, humor, and endless love. No one can ever imagine the depth of your bounty and your love of life. You fought against this terrible disease of cancer so bravely, because we needed you so. We hope you are at peace, and will miss you forever.
