        SHINN-Richard. We mourn with profound sadness the death of Richard Shinn, devoted member of our Managing Board from 1979 through 1994. His distinguished years of service as a member of the Executive Committee from 1986 through 1992, including the Committee Chairmanship in the 1989-1990 season, as Treasurer of the Board from 1986 through 1989 and as Chairman of the Finance Committee from 1980 through 1989, occurred at a critical time in the history of the Metropolitan Opera. During the years of his Board tenure, he made a deeply respected and important contribution to the long-term financial sercurity of our company. We valued his counsel, his wisdom, the generosity of his time in service to the Metropolitan Opera and his friendship. He leaves an enduring legacy to the institutions he served, including the Metropolitan Opera, and to the people of New York City. His life's work in public service is an inspiring example for future generations. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife Marion and his family. Metropolitan Opera Association
