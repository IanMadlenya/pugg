        WILCOX-Karen G. Bard College mourns the passing of Karen G. Wilcox, who died on October 17 after a courageous struggle with lung cancer. From 1969 to 1977, she worked at Franconia College in New Hampshire. In 1977, she became dean of admissions at Bard College. She was a beloved colleague and a friend. Our condolences go to her husband Joseph, her daughter Beagan, her stepchildren Susan and Michael, and to her mother and siblings. A memorial service will be held in the Chapel of the Holy Innocents, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, at 3 P.M. on Sunday, October 20, followed by a graveside ceremony at the Bard College cemetery.
