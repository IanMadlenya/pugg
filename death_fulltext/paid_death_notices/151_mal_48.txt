        WILLIAMS-Frederic H. The Juilliard School deeply mourns the death of our distinguished and beloved Trustee Frederic H. Williams, who was a member of the Board of the School from 1992 until his death. Fred brought enormous energy, optimism and expertise to his various responsibilities as a Board member. His generosity and support of Juilliard's programs, both of today and for the future, had a profoundly positive influence throughout the institution. The Juilliard community expresses sincere condolences to his wife, Gail, and his entire family. Mary Rodgers Guettel, Chairman Joseph W. Polisi, President
