        DEMPSTER--Curt. The Advisory Board of the Ensemble Studio Theatre mourns the recent passing of our brilliant Artistic Director and dear friend Curt Dempster. In his life Curt guided the production of more than 6,000 plays. Actor, director, producer, mentor, he propelled so many to find and to pursue their artistic lives. He celebrated individual truth-''going to the well'' -and challenged each artist in the community he created to find his or her own voice.
