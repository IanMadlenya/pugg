        COLLINS-Dan. The officers and members of the United Federation of Teachers mourn the loss of a brilliant and sensitive labor arbitrator. Labor and management have lost a valuable asset and a wise counselor. We were honored that his last major work was serving as chair of the state fact-finding panel that formed the basis of a breakthrough teachers' contract. His completion of this intricate and demanding work, despite illness, is a testimony to his integrity and his dedication to the collective bargaining process. We will miss him and offer our deepest sympathies to his wife and children. Randi Weingarten, President United Federation of Teachers
        COLLINS-Daniel Gerard. Suddenly on Sunday June 16th at age 72 after a brief illness. Beloved husband of Anne Weld Collins, dear brother of Muriel Collins, devoted father of Caitlin Ahl, Deirdre, Charles and Geoffrey Collins. Loving step-father of Serena, Evelyn, Alexander and Blake Crawford. Adoring grandfather of five. A memorial service will be announced at a future date.
