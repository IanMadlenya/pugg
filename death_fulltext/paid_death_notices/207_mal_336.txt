        WADSWORTH--Michael. It is with great sorrow that we announce the passing of Michael A. Wadsworth, Q.C., a football star who parlayed his love of sports and competition into an extraordinarily diverse and distinguished career as a criminal defense lawyer, broadcaster, corporate executive, Canadian diplomat and athletic director at his alma mater, Notre Dame University. Michael died after battling cancer the second time in the past two years. He was 60. Far beyond his accomplishments on and off the football field, Michael will be remembered for his devotion to his family, and in particular to his wife of 38 years, Bernadette, his greatest love and enduring passion. Michael's legacy will live forever as will his memory in the hearts of those who loved him. The family will receive friends on Thursday, April 29, between 7-9 pm and on Friday, April 30, between 2-4 pm and 7-9 pm at the Rosar-Morrison Funeral Home, 467 Sherbourne Street, Toronto. The service will be held at St. Michael's Cathedral, 200 Church St, Toronto on Saturday, May 1, at 12:30pm. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made to The Gifts of Life Transplant House, 702 Second Street, Rochester, Minnesota, 55902, U.S.A.
