        FAGAN--Frank, Poet. Author of The Moonlit Door, The Derelict Genius of Martin M, Maginn, and Pick A Word. Poet, soldier, editor, political organizer, Frank Fagan died swiftly September 22nd. He was 68. Novelist Burt Cole wrote that his poetry transmuted ordinary, everyday agonies into things of beauty and that no poet was more aware of the absurdities and indignities of existence. Frank lived intentionally, with great human dignity, elegance, and wit. He leaves the products of that life to us. He is survived by his family, dear friends, loves.
