        LADER--Lawrence. NARAL Pro-Choice New York deeply mourns the loss of Lawrence Lader, champion of reproductive rights for all women. A longtime leader and inspiration of the pro-choice movement, he was instrumental in winning New York State's repeal of abortion restrictions in 1970, leading the hearts and minds of an entire nation. His commitment and courage will be deeply missed. We send our heartfelt condolences to Mr. Lader's family and all those who were touched by his legacy.
