        COLLINS--Janet. The Metropolitan Opera deeply mourns the death of Janet Collins, a principal dancer in the company's ballet from 1951 to 1954 and the first African American member of the Met company. She will long be remembered not only for her historic role, but also for her exquisite artistry. We extend our sincerest sympathy to her family.
