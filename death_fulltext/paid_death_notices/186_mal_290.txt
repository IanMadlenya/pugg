        YOSHIMURA-Fumio. Artist and teacher, died, July 23 of complications from pancreatic cancer. He was 76. Fumio loved women, baseball, and meals shared with friends; literature, Mozart, and the streets of New York; movies, conversation and the towns of Italy. In his 11 years on the faculty of Dartmouth College, he frequently complained about academic life, but more often he praised the spirit and talent of his favorite students. He leaves a legacy of whimsical kites, elegant drawings, and his famous wood sculptures: ghostly evocations of objects that fascinated him, bicylces and sunflowers, typewriters and fish bones, saxophones and pea pods. He leaves another legacy to the friends fortunate enough to have crossed his path: memories of his warmth, optimism, and intelligence. We will miss him profoundly. Condolences to Carol, his loving wife and caretaker, and to Obadiah Watkinson, his devoted stepson. Jerry Howett
