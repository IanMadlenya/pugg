        ROGERS-Roy. The Board of Trustees of Our Lady of Mercy Healthcare System, and Our Lady of Mercy Medical Center, and the children served by the Roy Rogers & Dale Evans Children's Center mourn the death of America's ''King of the Cowboys'' Roy Rogers, beloved husband of Dale Evans. We extend our deepest sympathy to Dale, their children and grandchildren. Indeed, he will be remembered, not only for his motion pictures, television shows, rodeo shows and stage performances, but also for his acts of kindness and dedication to children and family values. He was committed to many charitable causes, and lent his name and support to the Roy Rogers & Dale Evans Children's Center of Our Lady of Mercy Medical Center in the Bronx. We are grateful to Roy Rogers & Dale Evans for their generous support of our treasured youngsters and for giving children everywhere role models they could believe in. This great American icon will be greatly missed, but will live on through the hearts and minds of people of all ages around the world. Edwin S. Mruk, Chairman Our Lady of Mercy Healthcare System Gary S. Horan, FACHE President and CEO Our Lady of Mercy Healthcare System
