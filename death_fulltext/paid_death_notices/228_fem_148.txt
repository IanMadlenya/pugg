        MYERS--Bernice Johnson. Born, June 19, 1923, died January 13, 2006. Bernice, known as Bee or Mom to all who loved her, brought her great spirit, strength of mind, and humor to the world. Bee was born with her twin, Helen, in Andersonville, a Scandinavian neighborhood on the North Side of Chicago. As a girl, she loved her family, her beloved sister and inspirational older brother, Ken. She was a softball player and an avid Cubs fan and she enjoyed canoeing during summers at the family lake house. Bee married Ken Myers, also of Chicago, March 15, 1952 and had three children, Jon, Jim and Susan. She cherished her six grandchildren, Peter, Miles, Sonny, Buddy, Colby and Genevieve. The Myers family moved from Chicago to Tokyo, Los Angeles, Alton, IL, Boston, and ultimately settled in Ithaca, NY in 1973. Bee and Ken loved Ithaca where they established and enjoyed lifelong friendships. Tennis, Bridge, gardening, sailing and traveling with her husband and friends were Bee's favorite pastimes. Bee has been a pillar of inspiration and strength for her children and friends. She brought joy, laughter and a smile that lit up the hearts of all who knew and loved her. Bee will be sorely missed by her husband, her children, entire family and friends. We love you, Mom.
