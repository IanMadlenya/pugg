        DAYAN-Rabbi Doctor Soleyman. The Young Israel of Holliswood/ Holliswood Jewish Center is deeply saddened by the passing of its esteemed member, Rabbi Dayan. He was a brilliant Jewish scholar and clinical psychologist who led the Persian and Holliswood/Jamaica Estates Jewish communities to ever higher levels of spirituality. Survived by his wife Naima, son Isaac, daughters Yafa and Esther and three grandchildren. Burial in Jerusalem. May his family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
