        BURNHAM--Robert. The Steinhardt School at NYU mourns the loss of former dean Robert Burnham. Bob served as dean for seven years and retired as professor emeritus in 1996. He was a committed administrator and scholar whose leadership shaped our School. We send our deepest condolences to his wife, Patricia, and to his children, grandchildren, and entire family.
