        GRAEBER--Eric Alan. Died on September 2, 2003, at the age of 51, after a prolonged battle with cancer. A lifelong resident of Manhattan, he worked for 22 years at the Library of the General Society of Mechanics and Tradesman, serving as its head librarian for the last decade. He compiled and edited ''Magic and Madness in the Library,'' a unique collection of literary works about libraries now in its third printing, and wrote a number of essays and reviews on cultural subjects. His friends and loved ones will always remember his courage, humor and decency. Eric Graeber is survived by his mother Ruth and brother David. A memorial service will be held at the General Society Library, 20 W 44 St, on Thursday, September 11, at 6 PM. In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to Calvary Hospital in the Bronx or to the library.
