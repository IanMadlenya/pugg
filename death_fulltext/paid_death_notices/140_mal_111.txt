        CREWDSON-Frank Roy ''Big D''. It is with great sadness that the Crewdson Family announces the death of Frank. He was born in Tenino, Washington in 1926 and he practiced psychoanalysis in New York for three decades. He will be buried in Becket, Massachusetts at a private ceremony. Frank was gentle, kind, warm, open, elegant, funny and supportive. He was a facilitator of young careers. We will miss him but know he lives on with us. We thank all the wonderful people who have filled our house with love & support. In lieu of flowers, please send contributions to Bargemusic in Brooklyn. ''Hope springs eternal''. Carole, Gregory, Michael and Natasha Crewdson
