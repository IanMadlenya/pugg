        BRYANT-Minnie Dick. Age 94. Passed away (as she lived) with dignity, on January 8th, surprising no one by waiting for a warm day in winter before joining her late husband Harry. Mrs. Bryant defined liberated woman decades before the phrase ever appeared in print, and leaves a legacy of love, laughter and strength to all who knew her, including her children Muriel and Julius Fielo, Albert and Marcia Bryant, Aileen and Meyer Osofsky, Barbara and Harvey Danowitz and Marjorie Bryant; her grandchildren Michael Fielo and Barbara Ciccone, Helene and Bill Webb, Robin and George Kuhn, Arthur Bryant and Nancy Johnson, Rikki Bryant and Eric Brenner, Larry and Wai-Lin Osofsky, Randy Osofsky and Stephen Kessler, Alan and Deirdre Osofsky, Gary Simon and Jennifer Seron, A. Jay and Joanne Baum, Paul and Dorothy Baum, and Richard and Margaret Baum; her twenty-one great-grandchildren; her sister Ida Senzer, and countless friends and other loved ones. Memorial services will be held at 12:15 pm today, Friday, January 9th, at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street, New York, NY. Shiva will be observed through Monday, January 12th at 400 East 56th Street. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Chemotherapy Foundation, at 183 Madison Avenue, NY, NY 10016.
