        CHALLENOR - Bernard, MD, MPH. The students, faculty, alumni and staff of Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health are deeply saddened by the sudden death of Dr. Bernard Challenor. At the time of his passing, he was Associate Professor and Director of the General Public Health Program (Health Policy and Management). During his long and distinguished career at the School, Dr. Challenor served in various capacities, as acting dean ('78-'80), as acting head of the division of Epidemiology and as former associate dean for hospital affairs at Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons. His expertise spanned many areas: comparative health systems of Great Britain, Canada, China and Cuba; health and the developing world, famine, debt crisis, poverty; health care of the disadvantaged and health and poverty in the US. For decades, he was a mentor to countless numbers of students and we are less for his passing. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his sister, Dr. Yasoma Challenor, and his legion of friends. A memorial service will be conducted on the Columbia campus at a time to be announced. Allan Rosenfield, MD, Dean
