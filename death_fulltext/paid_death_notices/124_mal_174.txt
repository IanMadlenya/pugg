        SKOLNIK-Nathan. Died on May 10, at the age of 85. Beloved husband of Rose for over 60 years, father of Richard (Louise) and Phyllis, grandfather of Seth, Sari, Deborah, Rebecca. A man of unswerving rectitude, boundless energy, immense curiosity and generosity, he was held in enormous esteem by all who knew him.
