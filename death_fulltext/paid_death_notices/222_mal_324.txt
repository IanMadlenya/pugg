        GIAMELLI -- Joseph. New York Medical College is stunned and grieved by the sudden loss of our Board of Trustee member Joseph Giamelli who died from injuries sustained in a car accident on July 28, 2005. Mr. Giamelli resided in Irvington, NY. Mr. Giamelli is survived by his loving wife of 34 years, Joann, his daughter, Christina and sons Richard, and Joseph Giamelli, Jr., M.D. Mr. Giamelli's career spanned many achievements as a shrewd executive for Citibank, Toys R Us and Barnes and Nobles. Mr. Giamelli was elected to the Board of Trustees of the College in 1996. During his tenure as trustee, he served on numerous Committees of the Board including the Development Committee, Academic Affairs and the Executive Committees. His involvement with the College began with his support of the pediatric hematology and oncology division and has grown through the years. Until his untimely death, he continued to be involved in the College's annual Founder's Dinner, the President's Circle, the Children's Cancer Fund and various College building and scholarship projects. We will miss his steadfast support and unselfish dedication. We extend heartfelt condolences to his loved ones. Visitors may call on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, 2-4 p.m. and 7-9 p.m. at Dwyer Funeral Home, 90 N. Broadway, Tarrytown.
