        MADDEN-Dr. John Leo. The members of the John L. Madden Surgical Society are saddened by the death of our beloved teacher. A distinguished master surgeon, teacher, researcher and author, he influenced the careers of many surgeons from all over the world. He was an excellent physician and a Compleat surgeon, but above all he was a tremendous human being and a perfect gentleman. His surgical family extend their deepest sympathy to his family and heartfelt gratitude for the privilege of having shared the life of Dr. Madden.
