        SLATTERY-Louis R. The Faculty, Staff and Trustees of NYU Medical Center mourn the passing of Louis R. Slattery, MD, treasured colleague, teacher and friend. A valued member of our community for more than 60 years, Dr. Slattery joined the NYU School of Medicine faculty in 1933, and remained until his retirement in 1999, with one exception: During World War II, he served for four years at the Seventh Evacuation Hospital in the South Pacific. In 1969, he was appointed Professor of Clinical Surgery. Trained as a general surgeon, he later developed a subspecialty in abdominal surgery, along with significant research interests. Dr. Slattery retired from the faculty in 1982, but continued to serve the Medical Center as Surgical Coordinator until 1999. We offer our deepest condolences to his family and loved ones. A memorial service will be held at NYU's Farkas Auditorium on Tuesday, April 17 at 4:00 PM. Robert M. Glickman, MD, Dean NYU School of Medicine Theresa A. Bischoff, President NYU Hospitals Center Thomas S. Riles, MD, Chairman Department of Surgery
