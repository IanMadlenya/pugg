        GOOTMAN-Phyllis M., Ph.D. The Faculty of the School of Graduate Studies, SUNY Downstate Medical Center at Brooklyn, mourn the sudden passing of their eminent Professor of Physiology and Pharmacology. Dr. Phyllis Gootman served the research and teaching mission of the Graduate School with distinction for more than 25 years. The excellence of her research on postnatal development of neural regulation of heart and lung function earned her worldwide recognition and regular support from the National Institutes of Health. The scientific community will sorely miss her substantial contributions to this field. Throughout Dr. Phyllis Gootman's tenure, she tirelessly devoted herself to mentoring young scientists. We extend our sincere sympathy to her husband Dr. Norman Gootman, her children Dr. Craig Gootman and Dr. Sharon Gootman Rosen, her mother Mrs. Ida Adler, and her brother Dr. Saul Adler Susan Schwartz-Giblin, Ph.D, Dean of the School of Graduate Studies
