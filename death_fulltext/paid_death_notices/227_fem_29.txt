        NICHINSON--Arline Judith. Of Boca Raton, Florida left us on December 2, 2005 at the age of 79. She was, and in our memories, will always be vital, exciting, young in heart, gentle and genuine. She was a truly beautiful lady. Arline was the lasting love of her husband David, with a marriage of 54 years, and the devoted and giving mother of Laurel Nichinson and Dr. Brad Nichinson. She was the sister to Ed, Robert and Howard Wiener, and like a sister, to their wives, as well as a beloved aunt to their many children. In addition, Arline truly cherished her many friends. Arline loved to dance and began in New York's Borscht Belt, followed by Vaudeville with the Caites Brothers and as Arline Castle, with the Castle Sisters. Arline was a dancer in ''As the Girls Go'' on Broadway and one of the original June Taylor dancers in Jackie Gleason's weekly TV Show. She also appeared on TV with Milton Berle and Patti Page. Arline excelled in everything she undertook. Her interests varied from her love of ballet and opera, to golf and bridge and our tennis trophies were all hers. She will be sadly missed. Services will be held Monday, December 5, 2005 at 1:00 PM at the Star of David, 7701 Bailey Road, North Ft. Lauderdale, FL 33068, 954722-9000. Donations may be made to the Boca West Cancer Research Unit, c/o Helene Miller 6697 Woodbridge Drive, Boca Raton, FL 33434.
