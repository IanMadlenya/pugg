        NORMAN-Eric T., 89. A man of extraordinary spirit & drive, gifted with a truly great natural voice. Working at WOR in the 40's and 50's Big Band era, nightly Eric announced big name band shows, e.g. ''Harry James Live from the Astor Roof'' and most of Duke Ellington's ''Live from Birdland'' broadcasts. Eric was a staff announcer on the original ''Rambling with Gambling''. His family and friends mourn their loss-he gave the impression that he'd go on forever. Service Friday, October 26, 10:30AM at McGrath Funeral Home, Bronxville. Visiting on Thursday, October 25 7-9 PM. We miss you, Eric. Survived by his wife, Alba, and children, Regina, Eric Jr. and Bruce.
