        BIBLE-Frances. New York City Opera deeply mourns the passing of one of its most revered and beloved company members. She passed away on January 29 in Hemet, CA., at the age of eightytwo after a brief illness. As a leading artist with NYCO from 1948-1977, she created some of the most vibrantly acted, beautifully sung, and memorable characters in our company's history, including Octavian, Dorabella, Lucretia, Cenerentola, Amneris, Ottavia, Hansel, Jocasta, Herodias, and Oberon, as well as Elizabeth Proctor in the world premier of ''The Crucible'' and Frade in the world premier of ''The Dybbuk''. She is perhaps best remembered as Augusta Tabor in NYCO's ''Ballad of Baby Doe'', a performance immortalized in a telecast and recently reissued recording. She was a preeminent figure in twentiethcentury American opera, performing with virtually every major opera company and symphony orchestra around the world. Her support of her fellow artists was exemplary, whether as a singing colleague or as a teacher at Rice University, where she served as Artist-in-Residence for fourteen years until her retirement in 1991. We will always remember her with great affection and respect. The music world has lost one of its greatest lights. Contributions in her memory may be sent to North Shore Animal League America, Lewyt Street, Port Washington, NY 11050. A memorial service is being planned for the spring.
