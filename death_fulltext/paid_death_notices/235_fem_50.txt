        HULACK--Carol. A brownstone pioneer on Manhattan's West Side, died August 4, at her New York home after a two year sarcoma battle. She was 70. Her sister Lorraine M. Weil, is US Bankruptcy Judge, Connecticut District. Mrs. Hulack was an active partner with her husband Larry in Lanfred Properties, a development firm started in 1969 with a brownstone purchase in a high-crime area on West 80th St. Nightly break-ins ceased only when the couple started sleeping in the building. Later, they restored a series of West 80's brownstones as part of the area's rebirth. She lectured at several NYU seminars on brownstone restorations. She also produced an admired slide history of the West Side's rebirth in the 1970's and 80's. Self-taught, she often advised neighbors on heating and water-leak issues. She was also a WW II history buff. In the 1970's and 1990's she served three year terms as a New York State court reporter, resigning each time to run a new brownstone project. She was a skilled cook and gardener. ''Her energy level was astonishing,'' said her husband. Born in Queens, she started caring for her year-old sister when their father, Edward Murphy, a New York police officer, died and her mother, Caroline, was forced to work. ''At the age of 10, I suddenly became a child-adult,'' she said. She said the chemotherapy, radiation, and major surgeries she underwent were ''worse than the disease.'' This year she converted to Judaism. A son, Lance Hulack, is a diretor at ING Capital Markets. Other survivors include her daughter-in-law, SueAnn Hulack; two granddaughters, Cameron and Rylee; a brother-in-law, Ronald Weil Sr., a niece, Mary Tufaga, and a nephew, Ronald Weil Jr. Funeral services will be held today at Riverside Memorial, W. 76th St and Amsterdam Ave, at 11:15 am. Burial will be in Sharon Gardens, Valhalla, NY. In lieu of flowers, kindly donate to Cabrini Hospice.
