        SCHNABEL--Jack. Died Saturday morning, January 17, 2004. The world will be a little bit dimmer except for those who believe he hasn't left us. He said ''I wish my wife was alive, she'd tell you what a good man I am.'' But he really didn't need to say that. The last thing he said was, ''Love me, love me.'' We do, we do. He was 92 years old. He is loved by his sister Sally Levine, his daughter Andrea Fassler, his son Stephen and his wife Renee, his son Julian and his wife Olatz Schnabel, 14 grandchildren and five great - grandchildren, and thousands of friends. A graveside service will be held January 19, 2004, at 10 am, at Adath Israel Cemetery, Pine Street, Middletown, CT.
