        CLURMAN-Herman. My Tax Professor at NYU. The person who helped me choose a career, a law school and my first employer. A man of great wisdom and integrity. My biggest honor was when Professor Clurman invited me to join him as an adjunct faculty member. Thank you. My condolences to the family. Alan J. Straus
