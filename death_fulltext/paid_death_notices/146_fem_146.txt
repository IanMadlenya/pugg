        SAYAO-Bidu. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of one of our greatest and most beloved artists, soprano Bidu Sayao. Her debut here in 1937 in the title role of Massenet's ''Manon'' began a love affair with the New York public which was enchanted by this small, beautiful woman with an unusually sweet voice and elegant stage demeanor. She went on to sing 236 performances of twelve roles with the Met. Her most frequent roles were her touching Mimi in Puccini's ''La Boheme,'' and her graceful Susanna in Mozart's ''Le Nozze di Figaro.'' Her ability to incarnate youthful, fragile and vulnerable characters while singing with a consistently beautiful tone and great musicality was unique. As charming offstage as she was on-stage, Ms. Sayao was held in the highest esteem by her colleagues and friends in the opera house. She continued to be a strong supporter of the Met after her retirement, and in 1983 became a Member of the Metropolitan Opera Association, a position she held until her death. We offer our sincere condolences to her family and to her many devoted friends. Joseph Volpe, General Manager James Levine, Artistic Director
        SAYAO-Bidu. The Richard Tucker Music Foundation is deeply sadden by the passing of this legendary Brazilian soprano and member of the Foundation's Board of Artists. She graced the stage of the Metropolitan Opera for 16 seasons, leaving an indelible memory of supreme vocal and dramatic artistry and she was also a wonderful concert and recital singer. We are fortunate that her recording of ''La Boheme'', recorded with Richard Tucker at the old Met, is a living reminder of her supreme and unique qualities, of which the greatest was her charm.
