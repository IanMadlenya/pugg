        HELDMAN--Gladys. I regret very much the passing of Gladys Heldman who so helped the cause of women's tennis in the 1950s. She, along with Billie Jean King, was responsible for women's tennis arriving and being recognized as an important international sports event. We all recognize the contribution she has made and send to her family our deepest regrets. Joseph F. Cullman 3rd Former Chairman Emeritus, Philip Morris Companies Inc. >>AD#
