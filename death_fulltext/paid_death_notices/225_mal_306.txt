        WHITMAN--Jules I. Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and American Associates, Ben-Gurion University sadly mourn the loss of one of our great leaders, Jules I. Whitman. Introduced to the University through his beloved wife Aileen, Jules served as former AABGU President, Chairman of the Board, and member of the University's Board of Governors. Vitally concerned with education and with a great love for the Jewish people and Israel, his service, philanthropy and legacy live on through his contributions to the AABGU Student Campus Housing Program, the Joyce & Irving Goldman Medical School and the Center for Women's Health and Promotions. Our deepest condolences to Aileen, David and Douglas, and the entire Whitman family. Prof. Avishay Braverman, President BGU Roy Zuckerberg, Chairman of BOG, AABGU Carol Saal, President AABGU
