Beloved and loving wife of Martin, mother of Douglas and Steven, grandmother of Veronica, sister of Harriet, aunt of Suzanne, Adam and Jeffrey.

For over twenty-five years she was a preschool director, a daycamp director, as well as a public school teacher. She was very involved with the PTA, holding the post of president. She also developed and taught a training program for volunteers to teach reading in the public schools. Elaine's family was always at the top of her list leading her to be a pack leader of the Cub Scouts, an assistant Little League coach and a second mother to many who had need. There will be a memorial service which will be announced in the near future. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made in Elaine's memory to the Suburban Temple, 516-221-2370.
