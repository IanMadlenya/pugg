        SMITH-Alex. On August 1, 2000, peacefully at home at the age of 94 years. Husband of Marsha. Father of Judith. Grandfather of Matthew, and younger brother of Eva now 97. Services will be held Thursday, August 3 at 10AM at the Sigmund Schwartz Gramercy Chapels, Second Ave and 10th St.
        SMITH-Alex. A mentor, a colleague, a friend. His support and valued counsel up until the very end can never be duplicated. Alex was the ultimate do-er. Impossible was never part of his lexicon. He will be sorely missed. We extend our deepest condolences to Marsha, Judy and Matthew. Bob, Bobbie, Kim
