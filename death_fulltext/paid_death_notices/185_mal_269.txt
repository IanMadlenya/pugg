        SCHONZEIT-David. We at Prudential Financial mourn the loss of our dear friend and colleague, David. David's tenture with the firm spanned nearly four decades, having served as a Financial Advisor, Branch Manager and in executive positions at both the regional and divisional levels. His career was marked with great distinction. He will be sorely missed by his many friends and colleagues at the firm. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his dear wife Irene, and to all his family.
