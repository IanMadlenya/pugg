        PEYRELONGUE--Lucile. Peter Martins, the Board of Directors, dancers and staff of New York City Ballet mourn the loss of Lucile Peyrelongue. Lucile was an etoile in our sky, and the light she brought into the life of the Company will shine always. A citizen of the world, Lucile made her home at NYCB for many years as a Director, enthusiastic fan, generous supporter and inspiration for countless events that benefited from her extraordinary eye and impeccable taste. In 1995 she made New York City Ballet's visit to Paris a magical experience that will never be forgotten. But most of all, Lucile unfailingly shared her passion, sense of fun, love of language, wonderful wit and exuberance for life with each of us. Our hearts are with Guy and Florence as we remember her.
