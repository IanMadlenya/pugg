        JENNINGS--Peter. The Board of Trustees and International Advisory Council of the American University of Beirut deeply mourn the death of Peter Jennings. Peter was a long-standing and valuable member of the AUB International Advisory Council, providing exceptional support and wise counsel to the University over the years. In 2004, the University was honored to bestow upon him an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters, which he so eminently deserved. He was a frequent visitor to the AUB campus, and he knew the entire Middle East region intimately. As an outstanding and esteemed journalist, he made a profound contribution to promoting a better understanding of the Middle East and its peoples to his global audiences. We shall miss our dear friend and offer our heartfelt sympathies to his wife, Kayce Freed, and his family. John Waterbury, President Thomas Q. Morris, Chairman Richard A. Debs, Chairman Emeritus American University of Beirut
