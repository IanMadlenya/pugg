        HECTOR--Louis J. The Trustees, faculty, and staff of The Rockefeller University deeply mourn the loss of our beloved friend, Louis J. Hector, Esq., an esteemed member of the Board of Trustees for twenty-five years. Louis Hector joined The Rockefeller University Council in 1977 and was elected to the Board in 1981. He became an emeritus trustee in 1991. Louis will be remembered for his generosity of spirit, wise counsel, and the enormous personal integrity that guided all aspects of his long and productive life. His enthusiasm for basic science encouraged Lucille P. Markey, one of the prominent clients of his law firm, Steel Hector & Davis, to become a benefactor of many research institutions, including this one. Following Mrs. Markey's death, he was instrumental in establishing the Lucille P. Markey Charitable Trust as an organization dedicated to the advancement of biomedical research. Under his chairmanship, the Markey Trust had a profound impact on the quality of scientific research in the United States, shining a bright light on the need for philanthropic investment in science and serving as a model for many foundations which followed. In 1994, The Rockefeller University recognized Louis Hector's enormous contributions to the advancement of science and medicine with an honorary doctoral degree. We will miss his keen intelligence, astute judgment, and inspiring optimism. His influence and legacy will be felt throughout the University for many years to come. We extend our condolences to his wife, Nancy; their beloved children; and the entire Hector family. Paul Nurse, President Joshua Lederberg and Torsten Wiesel, Presidents Emeritus Russell Carson, Chairman Richard Furlaud, Chairman Emeritus David Rockefeller, Honorary Chairman The Rockefeller University
