        FRIEDMAN-Muriel of Blauvelt, NY, passed suddenly on April 4, 1999, at the age of 70. She had lived a wonderful, compassionate, and dedicated life. She was a graduate of the Columbia University School of Social Work and had a distinguished career. Her intellect, good humor, caring, and innerstrength helped her overcome her physical disabilities and she served as a beacon and positive role-model for those people whose lives she touched at numerous social agencies including: Jewish Family Services of New York, St. Dominic's Home, and Rockland Childrens Center in Orangeburg, NY, the Rockland County Association for Retarded Citizens, and the Child Development Center in Pomona, NY. In retirement she also volunteered for the Rockland County Cancer Society, Nyack Hospital, the Rockland Parkinson's Group, and the NYS Commission on Quality Care for the Mentally Disabled. Muriel was devoted to her family and will be honored by her husband Dan; daughters Judy, Susan, and Lisa; their husbands/ partners Harry, David and Ronnie; and her grandchildren Tracey, Rachel, and Ruben. Services will be held at Hellman Memorial Chapels, 15 State St., Spring Valley, NY at 11AM today.
