        THOMPSON-Patrick R. A very good man. A very good friend. We shall miss you. Marty Greenberg, David Greenberg and the entire staff of Sterling Commodities.
        THOMPSON-R. Patrick. The Board of Directors, members, and staff of the New York Mercantile Exchange mourn the untimely death of Exchange President R. Patrick Thompson, 51, on July 19, 2000. Mr. Thompson, who was associated with the Exchange either as an executive or a trader for 20 years, was named president in October 1989. Previously, he held positions as executive vice president, senior vice president of compliance, and senior vice president and general counsel. Mr. Thompson was highly regarded in the energy, metals, and financial services industries and dearly beloved by his staff and many members of the trading community. Far more than his extensive professional accomplishments, his warmth, integrity, and humanity will stand as his legacy in the hearts of all who knew him.
