        BRUESTLE--Vera. The family of The Curtis Institute of Music mourns the loss of its beloved colleague and devoted friend Vera Bruestle. For nearly 20 years, her acumen in both administrative and aesthetic matters confirmed the unique spirit of our conservatory. Miss Bruestle, as she preferred to be addressed, provided invaluable support to the administrations of both John de Lancie and Gary Graffman. Since her retirement as executive assistant in 2002, she remained a close part of the Curtis family. Her role in our history will long be remembered and she will be dearly missed. Richard A. Doran, Chairman Gary Graffman President/Director The Curtis Institute of Music
