        HAUPTMAN--Philip Jonathan, died April 10 at the age of 63. A caring geriatric psychiatrist, devoted to his patients far beyond the call of duty. Surving him are his wife, Natalie, his sister Rabbi Judith, his brother-in-law, Milton Adesnik, and his three nephews, Ariel, Moshe, and Hillel. Funeral services at the Plaza Jewish Community Chapel, Tuesday, April 12 at 12 noon, Amsterdam Ave. and W. 91st St. Philip loved life and loved people. He lived fully and with great joy. He leaves a legacy of tireless, unstinting efforts on behalf of others. May we follow in his footsteps. Contributions may be sent to Doctors Without Borders to honor a doctor who himself crossed over many borders-physical, spiritual, and psychological--to help others. He will be sorely missed.
        HAUPTMAN -- Philip, M.D. Dearest friend and devoted doctor. The memory of your many acts of chesed comfort us who mourn for Zion and Jerusalem. Robert and Sandy April Aaron, Pamela, Ally, Sarah, and Daniel
