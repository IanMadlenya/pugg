        FERBER-Zelda. A loving mother to all whom she touched, died on Wednesday at the age of 77, leaving a rich legacy of love and family connection. As a teacher and counselor, Zelda was a trailblazer, a woman with exceptional social skills and a burning desire to make families work-both hers and those around her. Zelda shared her love with Arnold, her husband of nearly 57 years, her children Ilene & Bruce, and Roe & Steve, her grandchildren Dorothy, Olivia, Natalie, Melyssa, Marnie & Jill, her brother Allan, her sister-in-law Yvonne, her niece Cheri and her nephew Stuart. Zelda was born on February 25, 1923 in New York City, the only daughter of Sarah & Isaac Korman, attended Hunter College and embarked on a lifetime of contribution-raising both a vibrant family and the next generation. Her magnetic personality drew people to her in a special way. Her laughter and her spirit will be with us always. Services will be held Sunday, November 5, at 12:45pm at Riverside Memorial Chapel 180 W. 76 St. (Amsterdam).
