        URIS--Michael. Died Friday morning, at his home in his sleep, at 67. Uris, a noted advertising executive, is survived by his three children, one granddaughter, beloved ex-wife and a few close friends who would like him remembered as a man of brilliance, warmth, style, humor and generosity. He was a man whose gift for art was only exceeded by his love of it. His great passions were his children and the New York Yankees, and he would be happy that the Yankees won a thriller last night. Service at Plaza Jewish Community Chapel, July 16, 2006, at 2 PM.
