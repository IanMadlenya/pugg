        OSOWSKI-Paul David. (August 17, 1947-April 29, 1998) ''Not farewell, not farewell, but faring.'' The gentlest, sweetest, most compassionate, loving man we were privileged to share our lives with, became an angel on April 29th, succumbing to liver cancer after 18 years of successfully living with HIV and AIDS. Paul inspired everyone with his honesty, strength, courage, sensitivity, humor, caring and love. He taught us how to live ...to the fullest, and how to die... with dignity and grace. Paul entered this life in Chicago and left it in Sea Ranch, one of his favorite places. A Berkeley graduate, he lived in San Francisco for many years when not traveling the world viewing his beloved art and nature, sharing with family and friends his very special way of seeing that world. He was on the Advisory Board of The Community Consortium and worked with the HIV Health Services Planning Council and ACT UP in San Francisco. Paul is reunited with his mother, Helene, and survived by his loving sister/best friend Pamela, father Aloysius, brothers Alan and Mark, sisters Joyce Weber, Monica Tyre and Denice Kounalis, their families, and innumerable friends, doctors, nurses and helpers who became his extended family. An August memorial is planned. Condolences may be sent to the family at 414 East 52nd Street, New York, New York 10022. Contributions in Paul's memory may be made to The Community Consortium, 3180 18th Street, Suite 201, San Francisco, CA. 94110. ''Peace to you all, and love''.
