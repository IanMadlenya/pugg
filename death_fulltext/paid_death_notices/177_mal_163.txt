        HAZEN-William H. The Manhattan Institute for Policy Research and its Trustees mourn the passing of William H. Hazen. Bill was a devoted and loyal friend who understood the enormous consequence of ideas & the great responsibilities of citizenship. We shall miss him, and our prayers are with his family.
