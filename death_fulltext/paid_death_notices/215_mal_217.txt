        MORGAN--John Pierpont, II. On December 10, 2004 at age 86. For 42 years (1951-1993), a Member of the Board of Managers of The Havens Relief Fund Society and its able Treasurer for 32 years (1952-1984). Thereafter, at the Board's insistance he was thrice reelected to serve as a Manager for an additional nine years until he retired in 1993. His experience and sound judgement enabled him, during his long reign as Treasurer, to oversee substantial growth in the resources of the Society, thereby enabling it to multiply the number of individuals the Society could serve in adherence to its Founder's goals: ''to relieve poverty and distress, and especially the affording of temporary relief to unobtrusive suffering endured by industrious or worthy persons''. The Havens Relief Fund Society Arthur V. Savage, As President for The Board of Managers
