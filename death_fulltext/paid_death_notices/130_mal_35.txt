        LUBLINER-Rabbi Immanuel. We record with sorrow the passing of our beloved colleague. Ordained in 1960, he served the First Hebrew Congregation of Peekskill, NY and in 1964 assumed the pulpit of Greenburgh Hebrew Center in Dobbs Ferry, NY, becoming rabbi emeritus in 1977. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his widow, Sylvia, his sister, Henrietta Fassler, his brother Felix, and to his son, our colleague, Rabbi Jonathan Lubliner, and all who were touched through his rabbinate. Rabbi David L. Lieber, President Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Exec. VP, The Rabbinical Assembly
