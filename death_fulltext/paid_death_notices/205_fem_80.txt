        FRED--Marcy. The staff and Board of PENCIL are profoundly saddened by the untimely, tragic death of Marcy Fred, our colleague and friend of many years. Marcy was an integral part of our everyday work, and contributed her wit, intelligence and compassion to all decisions great and small. She was a passionate advocate for the students of the New York City public schools. Our ''Marge'' we love you and will miss you always. Thank you for all you gave us. Contributions to a special fund for a Bronx public high school student internship in Marcy's name can be made to PENCIL, 30 West 26th St, New York, New York 10010. Visitation will be at R.G. Ortiz Funeral Home, 2121 Westchester Ave, Bronx, NY 10462, 718-931-1500, Tuesday 2-10PM
        FRED--Marcy. Marcy, all of us at PENCIL will miss your spunk, intelligence and wit. You will forever live in our hearts. David Caplan
