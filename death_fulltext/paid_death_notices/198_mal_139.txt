He is survived by the adoring members of his loving family, including his wife, Bonnie Jean of Chapel Hill; two children, David Henry Morell and Sharon Maria Harbaugh; a grandchild, Katherine Harbaugh; and by his parents, Anatol and Helena Morell of Stony Brook, NY. Within the specialized field of molecular neurobiology, Dr. Morell's research interests centered upon metabolism and functions of myelin. He and his collaborators have published more than 120 papers in scientific journals as well as reviews, book chapters and textbooks. In addition to his principal duties as a teacher and research scientist in the medical school, Dr. Morell was a member of the University community and shared his knowledge and love of scuba diving with hundreds of undergraduate students. Dr. Morell was born on December 10, 1941, in Puerto Plata, the Dominican Republic, where his parents had settled briefly after fleeing from Poland at the outbreak of World War II. He graduated from Columbia College in 1963 and earned a doctorate in biochemistry in 1968 from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, NY. Dr. Morell joined the Biochemistry Department faculty at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill in 1973, where he continued to teach and conduct path-breaking research in the neurosciences for more than a quartercentury. Funeral arrangements are incomplete. >>AD#
