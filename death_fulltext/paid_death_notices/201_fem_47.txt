        GIFFORD--Marjorie Otis. The Board of Trustees of Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts notes with deep sorrow the loss of its dear friend Marjorie Otis Gifford, whose devotion to Caramoor dates back many years to her friendship with its founders Walter and Lucie Rosen. She was a strong advocate and supporter of Caramoor's programs for school children to develop an appreciation of classical music and to aide in instrumental training. An asset to the community, Mrs. Gifford will be sorely missed.
