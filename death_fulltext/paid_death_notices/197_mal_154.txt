        GERBER--Donald S., M.D., Ophthamologist, died at only 53 years of age at home in Australia following a courageous battle with M.N.D. He graduated from Jamaica High School, Princeton University, Stanford Medical School and his residency was at NYU. In 1978 he married Cynthia Asness of Little Neck, NY and in 1981 their beautiful daughter Alexis was born. Don had an exceptionally accomplished career. He will be missed terribly by his daughter, his sister Joanne, his mother Marion, his devoted patients and everyone who knew him. As his wife, he was the love of my life, my soulmate, my hero. Condolences to P.O. Box 46, Sassafras, Vic. Australia 3787 >>AD#
