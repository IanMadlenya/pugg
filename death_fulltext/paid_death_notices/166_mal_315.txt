        DAWID-Heinz. Fross Zelnick Lehrman & Zissu, PC, records with great sorrow the loss of one of our founding partners, Heinz Dawid, on November 25, 2000. Born and educated in Germany, he received a Doctorate of Law from the University of Berlin in 1935. In 1936 he published, illegally, a book summarizing Nazi legislation affecting the rights of German Jews entitled ''The Legal Position of Jews in Germany.'' He left Germany in 1939 and made his way to China, where he lived and practiced law for ten years. After moving to the United States, he received a law degree in 1951 from Brooklyn Law School. In June, 1969 he became a founding member of Weiss Dawid Fross Zelnick & Lehrman, an intellectual property firm now known as Fross Zelnick Lehrman & Zissu, PC. He published several works in the fields of trademark and unfair competition law. Heinz Dawid was known for his productivity, his passionate identification with his clients, his relentless pursuit of developments in the law, his endless store of experience and knowledge and his sense of decency, humor and professionalism. We extend our deepest sympathy to the entire Dawid family. A memorial service is being planned by the firm.
