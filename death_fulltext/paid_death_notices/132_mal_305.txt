        RODMAN-Morris. The officers, trustees and staff of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee express their deep sorrow at the loss of Morris Rodman, a longtime member of the JDC Board and a prominent leader nationally and in world Jewry. In addition to his JDC activities, he played a significant role in his Washington community and in Israel, where he and his late wife, Gertrude, established the Ruth Youth Wing of the Israel Museum in memory of their daughter. Morris and his family were pioneers in establishing high schools in Israel and were benefactors of the Community College in Tel Chai. Condolences to his family. Jonathan W. Kolker, President Michael Schneider, Exec. VP Ambassador Milton A. Wolf Chairman of the Board
