        BENIOFF-Florence. The Board of Directors and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the death of Florence Benioff, beloved mother of our distinguished friend and long-time advocate Barbara Friedman, former chair of the Distribution Committee who currently serves on our Board of Directors. Throughout her life she exemplified the highest values of our tradition, which she conveyed with warmth to her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. We express our sincere sympathy to her children: Barbara and her husband, Stephen; son Richard and daughter-in-law Mary; and all the members of the family. A woman of valor, she will be missed by all who knew her. May her memory endure for a blessing. James S. Tisch, President Larry Zicklin, Board Chair John S. Ruskay, Exec VP & CEO
