        MENIS-Nat. In sorrow, we celebrate the life of Nat Menis, a Tranquility-ite for 80 years. A camper in the 20's, alumni president and chairman for 25 years, and ''pop-pop'' to the campers for the past 30 years, he was known to all generations since the beginning. With a quick wit, enduring smile and a big heart he represented Tranquility with joy. His spirit will endure in our hearts forever. Tranquility Alumni Inc.
