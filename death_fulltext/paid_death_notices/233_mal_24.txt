        JONAS--Seymour. Grandpa died on May 31, 2006 after a long and valiant battle with cancer. He leaves behind his wife, children, daughters-inlaw and grandchildren which he adored. Grandpa was a brilliant man with a love of gardening, fixing everything, The Times crossword puzzles and most importantly a great love of family and life. He taught his family to laugh, deal with the good and bad events of life, and to treat people with respect and kindness. He lived a 3-speed life in a 10-speed world. He will be missed greatly but remembered every minute of every day. Love, His Family & Friends
