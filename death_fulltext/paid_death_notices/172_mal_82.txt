        BLACK-Charles L., Jr. The Columbia Law School community mourns the passing of Professor Charles L. Black, Jr. Charles was one of the great legal figures of the second half of the 20th Century-an extraordinary academic and a tireless advocate for civil and constitutional rights. His talents extended beyond the law to poetry, art and music. Charles' warmth, lively mind, engagement with students and dedication to jazz were an important part of life at Columbia. Our deepest sympathies go out to his wife, Columbia law professor and former Law School Dean Barbara Black, and their family. David W. Leebron, Dean Columbia Law School
