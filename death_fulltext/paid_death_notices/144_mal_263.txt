        GIFFORD-James P. The Board of Directors, Members and Staff of the New York City Partnership note with deep sadness the passing of James P. Gifford. As Executive Vice-President of the Partnership for almost a decade, Jim played a critical role in creating the legislative and political strategy that transformed New York's financial condition, economic prospects and increased the availability of affordable housing. His work was always characterized by intelligence, compassion and decency. David Rockefeller, Honorary Chairman
