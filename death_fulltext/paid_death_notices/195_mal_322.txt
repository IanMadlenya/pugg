        DUMLER-Egon. I started writing this when I heard that the hospice people were taking good care of you, easing your way, just as you eased all our ways, through wills, lawsuits, questions, and you eased our way through them, with a kind word, a gentle joke, and always the time to say words of encouragement. I will miss you dear Egon, I will miss your smile, your laugh and your good advice. But most of all, I will miss your delightful humanity. You were never just an attorney, you were a friend, a good friend. Someone once wrote, a friend isn't just someone who does favors, a friend is a person who reminds you who you are, and what you are. You always reminded me. Goodbye old friend, Lester
        DUMLER-Egon. The firm of Dumler & Giroux, and its staff, mourn the passing of their esteemed colleague, Egon Dumler. A renowned entertainment attorney for over forty years, his professionalism, expertise, and guidance will be sorely missed. To Egon, no conflict was ever insurmountable, and he maintained that attitude throughout his last and most valiant battle. As an eternal optimist, everything was always ''terrific'' or ''cool.'' Even on a bad day he was ''mildly superb.'' Egon, you will be missed but never forgotten. You're a superior human being.
