        PAINE-Stephen D. The Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Wiliamstown, MA., mourns the passing of our beloved friend Stephen D. Paine, a trustee since 1981. He immeasurably shaped and directed the Institute through his dedicated and active involvement. His wise counsel and passion for art and art museums will be sorely missed by everyone at The Clark, who valued his sage advice. Our hearts go out to his devoted wife Susan, who was such a vital support to him. Robert J. Geniesse, President, Michael Conforti, Director
