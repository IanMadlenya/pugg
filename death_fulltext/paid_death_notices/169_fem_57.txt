        GOLDING-Elizabeth Bass. The trustees, faculty, staff, alumni and students of New York University Law School are deeply saddened by the loss of Judge Elizabeth Bass Golding, Class of 1921. Judge Golding was a pioneer at a time when few women took up the challenge of the legal profession. Judge Golding met her husband and classmate, the late Samuel Golding, at NYU Law. He graduated first in his class and Judge Golding graduated second. We are very proud to have counted her as one of our own. Her lifelong commitment to NYU Law School is commemorated by the Golding Media Center and the Judge Elizabeth Bass Golding and Samuel Golding Student Lounge. In 1988, Judge Golding was awarded the Law School's highest honor, the Arthur T. Vanderbilt Medal. Our community is grateful for Judge Golding's years of service and her devotion to NYU. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to her family. John Sexton, Dean NYU School of Law Lester Pollack, President NYU School of Law Foundation
