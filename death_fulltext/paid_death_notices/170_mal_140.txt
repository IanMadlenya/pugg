        PHILIPS-Alben. Career newspaperman known to his friends and colleagues as Bill or Flip, died of natural causes February 16, 2001. He was raised and died on East 15th Street in Manhattan. He was 89. Essentially a self-taught man, he was hired by the New York World in the 1930's. In 1941 he joined the Daily Mirror as a Copy Editor. During his tenure at the Mirror, he also taught journalism courses at Long Island University. Nineteen years later, he became a member of the foreign and then metro copy desk at The New York Times, again for nineteen years. He was a staunch union man and a shop steward for the Guild while at the Times. In 1979 he spent a year in Paris working for The International Herald Tribune before returning to New York. He then continued copy editing at India Abroad until he was 85. A lifelong automotive enthusiast, Mr. Philips authored two books in the late 1950s for Arco/Fawcett about small cars, predicting America's enbrace of the compact, as well as many feature articles on a variety of subjects for various publications. In addition, he was a gifted musician able to play several instruments. In fact, his first job as a journalist was music critic for a small chain of newspapers in upstate New York. A lingering case of Tuberculosis from his youth kept him out of World War II, his greatest regret. Above all, Bill Philips was a kind, gracious, empathetic, cultured, nurturing man with a wonderful S.J. Pearlman/ Monty Python sense of humor. He is survived by a son and daughter, Binky and Dezanne, his wife Ruth Gray, his daughter-in-law Susan, his granddaughter Eleanor, his brothers Henry and Eliot, his sister Shirley and many nieces and nephews who will all miss him for the rest of their lives. Memorial service will be announced at a later date.
