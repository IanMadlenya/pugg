        ROGOW-Helen. Boys Town Jerusalem mourns the passing of a cherished member of its extended family, who together with her partner in life and philanthropy, Louis Rogow, of blessed memory, enabled the school to fulfill its mission of turning young boys from limited backgrounds into young men with limitless futures. Above and beyond opening their home as a means of introducing others to Boys Town, the Rogows also opened their hearts, demonstrating their commitment to disadvantaged youth and the State of Israel by becoming Chai Founders and establishing a Major Scholarship Endowment. The individual and collective achievements of Boys Town's students will serve as a lasting tribute to both Louis and Helen's memory. We extend heartfelt condolences to the entire family. Rabbi Moshe Linchner, Dean Michael J. Scharf, President Raphael Benaroya, Chairman Josh S. Weston, Honorary Chair Rabbi Ronald Gray, Exec VP
