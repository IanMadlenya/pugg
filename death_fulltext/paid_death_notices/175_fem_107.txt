        HELMAN-Anne. On August 12, 2001. Beloved wife of the late Michel. Her family and friends grieve the loss of a woman who led her life with courage and dignity until she closed her twinkling blue eyes for the last time in her 94th year. Her daughter Joan and son-in-law Bob, her granddaughters Rachel and Lauren, her nieces Aimee and Irene, and her dear Auli & Tamara will miss her terribly.
