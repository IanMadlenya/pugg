        WAGNER-George, Hazzan. The Cantors Assembly records with sorrow the passing of a revered colleague of over four decades. A brilliant cantor with a magnificent voice, he quietly and gently served the spiritual needs of his congregation, Beth Yeshurun of Houston, Texas, for over 47 years with dignity, warmth and care. His kindness, his humanity and his caring inspired us all. We extend our sympathy to his family and loved ones. May his memory abide as a blessing. Hazzan Chaim Najman, President Hazzan Stephen J. Stein, Exec. VP Hazzan Abraham B. Shapiro Exec. Administrator
