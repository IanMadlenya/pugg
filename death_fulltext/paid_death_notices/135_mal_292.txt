        KOVI-Paul. The Board and staff of Citymeals-on-Wheels are deeply saddened by the loss of our generous friend and former Board member, Paul Kovi. We all will miss his wise insights and caring conern for frail and isolated New Yorkers who depend on daily hand-delivered meals. Our sympathy goes to Paul's family, his friends, and his colleagues at The Four Seasons Restaurant.
