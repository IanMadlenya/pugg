        MENGE-John (Jack). Of Lyme, New Hampshire, who was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on March 17, 1927, died this week, leaving his ex-wife Geneva, his four children Rich, Karen, Lissa and Susan, eight grandchildren and many friends and colleagues. Jack earned his B.A. from the University of Idaho and his Ph.D. from MIT. He went to Dartmouth in 1956 where he held various positions including Chairman of the Economics Department. He retired in 1999 as the longest serving professor at Dartmouth. At the time of his death, he was serving as an outside director of the Yankee Farm Credit Bank (New Hampshire, Vermont and Northeast New York). In addition to his professional activities, Professor Menge devoted himself to improving education in New Hampshire. He was elected to the State Legislature as the first democrat to be elected from the Lyme-Orford District in 200 years. As a legislator, he was an early proponent of a state income tax. Jack also made maple syrup on his 220 acre farm. His greatest accomplishment though, was his role as a father and grandfather. A service will be held Saturday, February 23rd, 2PM at Lyme Congregational Church. A reception will follow in the Church Hall. Memorial contributions may be made to the Jack Menge Fund, Lyme Foundation, POB 292, Lyme, N.H. 03769. A memorial service will be held at Dartmouth College later this year.
