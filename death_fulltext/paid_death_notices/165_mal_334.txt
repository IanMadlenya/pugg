        OLSON-Dr. Sidney L. We mourn the loss of a true Ba'al Chesed in the world of Jewish and general philanthropy. As a Benefactor of the Medical Center, together with his wife, Miriam, his outstretched hand of kindness made an invaluable contribution to the people of Jerusalem and Israel. His exceptional efforts at chairing the fund-raising activities of the Shaare Zedek Southeast Region will always be cherished, as well as the personal friendship that he developed with each and every one on the Board. An Honorary Life Member of the International Board of Governors, he demonstrated a deep commitment to the Hospital. His presence added a great measure of prestige to the Board and his wise counsel was respected. Sidney personified the highest values of Jewish tradition and ethics which were the hallmarks of his life. Our sincerest condolences to his daughter, Dr. Arlene Olson-Muravchick, his son, Norman Olson and the entire family. May they be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
