        SHANOK--Hazzan Morton. The Cantors Assembly notes with profound sadness the passing of one of its founding members, Hazzan Morton Shanok. The first editor of the ''Cantor's Voice'' later to become the ''Journal of Synagogue Music'', Hazzan Shanok devoted most of his pulpit career to serving Temple Beth El of Swampscott, MA. Our Assembly wishes to convey its condolences to Hazzan Shanok's family. May his memory remain as a blessing to all those who were touched by his goodness.
