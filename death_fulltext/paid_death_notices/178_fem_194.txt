        SCHREIBER-Evelyn. AMIT is deeply saddened by the untimely passing of our most beloved, dedicated, devoted and pioneering Honorary President, magnanimous patron of AMIT's needy children in Israel, and cherished mother-inlaw of Elaine Schreiber, AMIT Southwest Regional Vice President. A true woman of valor, with great charm, charisma, superb skills and genuine warmth, Evelyn Schreiber mentored hundreds upon hundreds of AMIT leaders through more that half a century of active and dynamic leadership. Evelyn was very much loved by all, and was profoundly committed to Torah values, religious Zionism, the State of Israel, and all Jewish communal causes. Her life's mission was to help where help was needed, and to make this world a more secure and better place for all mankind. She will be sorely missed. Heartfelt condolences to her children Honey (Herb) Levinson, Dr. Saul (Elaine) Schreiber, Avram (Renee) Schreiber, Simi (Shifi) Schreiber, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Sondra Sokal, President Marvin Leff, Executive Dir
