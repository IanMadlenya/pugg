        LEVINE-Sheldon R. With deep sorrow we mourn the passing of our beloved brother-in-law Shelly who fought a gallant 13 year battle against lymphoma, which no one thought he'd lose, but time finally overwhelmed him. He will forever be in our hearts. We are heartbroken. Vivian and Sidney Sloves
