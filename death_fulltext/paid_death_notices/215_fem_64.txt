        PARISI--Barbara. We mourn the loss of our Board Member and friend, who inspired us with her valiant fight to beat lung cnacer--both the disease and the stigma that haunts the diagnosis. She was tireless in her campaign, bringing intelligence, hope and a tenacious can-do spirit to increasing understanding of lung cancer and the desperate need for greater research funding. Throughout her illness, she made time to encourage other patients and also to celebrate her life and the family she loved so much. Barbara will forever inspire us. We send our deepest condolences to her husband, Paul, and her daughters. The Board of Directors of Joan's Legacy: The Joan Scarangello Foundation to Conquer Lung Cancer
