        BURG-Yosef. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum mourns the passing of Dr. Yosef Burg, Chairman of the International Council of Yad Vashem and esteemed elder statesman and scholar. Having fled the Nazis himself in 1939, Dr. Burg's fervent commitment to the survivors and memory of the Holocaust took root in the immediate post-war period and was expressed throughout his long and distinguished career. His leadership in the cause of Holocaust remembrance and his generosity as a colleague will be greatly missed. The Museum extends its deepest condolences to his family and the people of Israel.
