        BERGER-Leo V., Captain. It is with profound sorrow that the Officers, Board and Members of United Cerebral Palsy of New York City acknowledge the passing of a devoted and generous friend. Through his longstanding friendship with our founder, Jack Hausman, Leo Berger became a staunch supporter of the needs of children and adults with cerebral palsy-and their families-over many years. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Arvilla, and to the entire Berger family. Leo Hausman, Chairman Martin Hausman, President Edward R. Matthews, Exec. Dir.
