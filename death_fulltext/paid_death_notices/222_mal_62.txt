        BLISS--David. We mourn the passing of a good friend and co-worker who tried so hard to overcome his illness, but in the end, succumbed to its devastating effects. We remember him as Publisher of Private Label Magazine (1993-1996), as Director of Marketing for Private Label Manufacturers Association (1997-2005), but most of all as a warmhearted, fun person to be with who could make everyone laugh and laugh and laugh. We will miss him always. Private Label Manufacturers Association Brian Sharoff, President Myra Rosen, Vice President Tim Simmons, Vice President and all his friends
