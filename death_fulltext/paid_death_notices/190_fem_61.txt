        RENFIELD-Beatrice. Lost to us November 6, 2002. Eightyeight years young she was a devoted mother, a concerned and passionate friend. A woman ahead of her time, she had many firsts and became a force for innovation and change with the compassion and ability to empower women of all ages. The very first wedding at the Waldorf-Astoria was for Beatrice and Harold Renfield in 1933. Soon after she became the first woman senior executive for the international firm Renfield Importers. An enduring patron and supporter of Theatre and Film she held the first and only audition for the play ''West Side Story'' in her home. Over the years Beatrice Renfield became deeply committed to the care of the caregivers in medicine. She believed that excellent nursing is the very foundation for quality healthcare today. We shall remember Bebe as a friend to us and our children. Over the years we have come to know her strength, humor and generosity which has helped so many out of the dark and into the light. The world was a better place with you in it, BeBe. Godspeed. The Maitland family, Kate, Taryn, Bryan and Richard The Smith family, Karen, Megan, Aidan and Richard Lori Kaufman
