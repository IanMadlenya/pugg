        KOSSTRIN--Bessie. Of New York passed away on July 5, 2005, peacefully after a brief illness in her 86th year. Beloved wife of the late Archie, devoted mother of five accomplished children, and loving grandmother of seven lively grandchildren, she was an avid reader and a devoted teacher in the New York City Public School System. She took pleasure in teaching many hundreds of underprivileged children the value and importance of the written word. Donations in her memory to the Hadassah Organization would be greatly appreciated.
