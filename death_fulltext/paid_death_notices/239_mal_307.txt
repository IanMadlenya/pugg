        BOEHM--Robert. The Board and Staff of the Center for Constitutional Rights mourn the death of our Chairman, Robert Boehm. Since our 1966 founding, Bob has been a powerful presence and generous benefactor, demanding that CCR hew to its progressive mission to defend the Constitution and international human rights. Bob and his beloved wife Fran, who died this year, inspired and supported many progressive institutions in addition to CCR. A solid and robust force, Bob actively participated in our cases and advocated expanding CCR's anti-racism and anti-war work. We hope, through our work and our lives, to pass on his values to younger generations. We will love, cherish and miss him forever, and send our love and sincere condolences to his family. Michael Ratner, President, CCR E. Vincent Warren, Executive Director, CCR
