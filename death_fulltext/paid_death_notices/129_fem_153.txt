        MILLER-Marion Edwards, 81. Loving wife of Professor Neal E. Miller, died of pneumonia in the Yale/New Haven Hospital on October 13. To us former students of Professor Miller at Yale and Rockefeller University (many of whom are now famous psychologists and neuroscientists), Marion was a great source of comfort and encouragement in times of the stress connected with our training. To her husband, her two children, York and Sara Mauch, and her five grandchildren, we offer our heartfelt condolences. Others wishing to join us can express themselves to Professor Miller care of The New Haven Funeral Service (203-777-2309). A memorial service will be held on October 24, 3:30 P.M., at the Unitarian Society of New Haven, 700 Hartford Tpk., Hamden, CT. (203-288-1807). In lieu of flowers, send donations to either the Unitarian Society or the American Indian College Fund, 21 W. 68th St, NYC 10023, 212-787-6312.
