        HAMDANI-Viqar. We mourn the passing of Dr. Viqar Hamdani, our longtime trustee and prominent Moslem leader. He was a man of compassion, peace and tolerance, and his contributions to interreligious understanding and freedom will be sorely missed. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Nafisa, and his entire family. Rabbi Arthur Schneier, Pres. Arch. Khajag Barsamian, VP Rev. Joseph O'Hare, S.J., VP Appeal of Conscience Fdn.
