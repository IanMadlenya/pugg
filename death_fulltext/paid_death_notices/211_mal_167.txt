        DAMESEK--Morton. Camp Wayne has lost a dear member of its family. Morty was an integral part of camp for more than 20 years. During that time he touched the lives of thousands of campers and staff members with his optimism and loving nature. We are all so grateful for our summers spent with Morty.
