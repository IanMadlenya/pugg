        JONES--Douglas Wiley. The Empire State Pride Agenda will greatly miss our dear friend and colleague Douglas Wiley Jones, who passed away on August 9, 2006. Doug served on the Board of Directors of the Pride Agenda for many years, most recently on the Executive Committee as the Treasurer of our organization. Doug and Louis Bradbury, his partner of 34 years, worked tirelessly to raise awareness of our issues and demonstrated through their commitment an unwavering dedication to the fight for LGBT equality. A memorial service will be held at noon on Friday, September 15 in the Stanley H. Kaplan Penthouse in the Rose Building at Lincoln Center. Doug's family, friends and colleagues will join together to celebrate Doug's remarkable life. Doug's family has created the Douglas Wiley Jones Memorial Fund at the Empire State Pride Agenda to ensure that Doug's legacy continues in the struggle for LGBT civil rights.
