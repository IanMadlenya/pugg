        ZAKIM-Leonard. The Anti-Demfamation League mourns the untimely passing of our dear colleague and friend, Leonard Zakim, ADL New England Regional Director in Boston. For more than 20 years Lenny served the League and the Jewish people with dedication and distinction. He worked tirelessly to combat anti-Semitism, racism and bigotry and to promote interfaith relations, civil rights, and the State of Israel. Through his commitment, creativity and unique ability to bring people together, Lenny made indelible contributions so his community would be a better place for all people. We will miss his vision, passion and indominable spirit. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Joyce, Joshua, Shari, Deena and the entire family. Abraham H. Foxman, National Director
