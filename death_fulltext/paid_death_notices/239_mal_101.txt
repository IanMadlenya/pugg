        ROSENBLUM--Robert. The Pollock-Krasner Foundation is devastated at the loss of our beloved friend and colleague Robert Rosenblum, whose advice and caring for the well-being of artists was so inspirational and deeply appreciated. We shall miss terribly his warmth, compassion, insight and humor. Our deepest sympathy goes to his wife Jane and his children Theo and Sophie. Charles C. Bergman, Chairman. Samuel Sachs II, President. Eugene V. Thaw, President Emeritus. Kerrie Buitrago, Executive Vice President.
