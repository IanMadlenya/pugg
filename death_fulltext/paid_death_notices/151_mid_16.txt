        POLAKOFF-Gail. Beloved wife of Rabbi Dale Polakoff of the Great Neck Synagogue and devoted mother and sister. Her personal qualities of mind and heart endeared her to all those whose lives she touched. She was a strengthening influence and support to her husband, taking justifiable pride in his rabbinate. She will be remembered as courageous and uncomplaining, as one who dealt with inordinate challenge with the dignity of a matriarch, refusing to be conquered by it, and never giving in to self pity to insulate herself in a private world. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Rabbi Polakoff, his children and the members of the congregation. Dr. Robert S. Widom, Rabbi Lloyd Goldfarb and Sandor C. Schweiger, Co-Presidents Temple Emanuel of Great Neck
