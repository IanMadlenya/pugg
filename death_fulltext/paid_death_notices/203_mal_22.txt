        LINDQUIST--Warren T. ''Lindy''. My dear friend Lindy Lindquist died November 15, 2003 at his home in Seal Harbor, ME. He was 84. From the time Lindy and I served together in Paris during WWII, he was my trusted associate in the fields of banking and urban affairs. As Executive Director of the Downtown Lower Manhattan Association, he helped conceive of the idea of the World Trade Center. He served as the first CEO of the New York City Community Preservation Corporation, played a key role in organizing Morningside Gardens, and in establishing the New York State Housing Finance Agency and the Urban Development Corporation. He served with distinction under President Reagan as the first General Manager of the New Community Development Corporation in the Department of Housing and Urban Development and as the first Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. He was a principal associate in the development of L'Enfant Plaza in Washington, and Embarcadero Center in San Francisco. I offer my most heartfelt sympathy to his wife Muriel, his ten children, twelve grandchildren and four great grandchildren. Lindy was a great person and a wonderful friend, who I will miss for the rest of my life. David Rockefeller, New York, N.Y.
