        FRIEDLANDER - Daniel. The Board and staff of the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation record, with great sorrow, the untimely death of our beloved colleague of almost 20 years. His legacy is vast. A brilliant and innovative econometrician, Dr. Friedlander pioneered in developing many of the analytical tools for determining the effectiveness of social programs, in the search for better ways to improve the economic security and well-being of low-income children and families. A scholar of total integrity, he was a kind and generous mentor to a generation of MDRC researchers, and a respected figure throughout the social policy community. Daniel was the author or coauthor of dozens of major reports, papers, and an important book summarizing the long-term effects of welfare-to-work programs. He was also unfailingly decent, caring, and responsible. Supported by his family, he bore his hard struggle with terminal illness with strength and grace. We extend our deepest sympathies to Daniel's beloved wife, Denise; his adored sons, Eric and Adam; his devoted parents and sister; and his many friends.
