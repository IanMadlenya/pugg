        WIGGINS-Ronald E. The partners, associates and staff of Fross Zelnick Lehrman & Zissu record with profound sorrow the sudden loss of our associate and friend, Ronald E. Wiggins, on October 28, 2000. Ron joined our firm in 1998, and immediately became an active and highly-valued member of our litigation department. He was a 1996 graudate of the New York University School of Law, where he was an editor of the Review of Law and Social Change. He received a Master of Arts degree in Sociology in 1993, and a Bachelor's degree, with Honors in Sociology and Communications in 1991, from the University of Missouri. We extend our deepest sympathy to Ron's parents, Robert and Susan Wiggins, of Grain Valley, MO, and to the rest of the Wiggins family.
