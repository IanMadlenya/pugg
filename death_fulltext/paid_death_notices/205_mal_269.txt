        WURTELE--Morton Gaither, died February 14, 2004. Born in Harrodsburg, Kentucky, in 1919. He was at home in Chicago, Cambridge, Los Angeles, Jerusalem and, finally, Berkeley. A Professor of Atmospheric Sciences at UCLA until his retirement, he had wide-ranging interests and an unusual combination of scientific and linguistic skills. His kindness, tolerance, wit, and appreciation of so much and so many were a constant source of inspiration for his family and friends. He was a generous loving husband, father, grandfather, and father-in-law whose words of encouragement and expressions of enjoyment were a gift to us all. He is survived by his wife Zivia Syrkin Wurtele, his children Jonathan and Eve Syrkin Wurtele, his grandchildren Dimitri, Mashette and Judy Syrkin-Nikolau, and Abby and David Wurtele, daughter-in-law Lisa Karp Wurtele and son-in-law Basil Nikolau. A memorial service will be held March 16, 5PM, at the UCLA Faculty Club.
