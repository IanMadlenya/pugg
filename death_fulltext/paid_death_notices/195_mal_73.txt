        CHARNEY-Sara. The Yeshiva University family mourns the passing of a widely respected matriarch who was an active Jewish leader in Teaneck, NJ and in recent years in Ranaana, Israel, the beloved mother of YU Guardian Leon H. (and Tzili) Charney and Byrna Blumenreich, and a cherished grandmother. She was proud that her son received the Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1977 from Yeshiva College; and that he was honored with YU's Peace Award at a dinner by the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law on whose Board of Directors he serves with distinction, in recognition of his role in helping with the Camp David Accords; and of his establishment of the Leon and Tzili Charney Mentorship Program at RIETS. May the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem as they help perpetuate the noble Jewish heritage their mother inculcated in them. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Ronald P. Stanton, Chairman, YU Board of Trustees Julius Berman, Chairman RIETS Board of Trustees Earle I. Mack, Chairman CSL Board of Directors
