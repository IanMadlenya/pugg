        DOUGLAS--Bernice, passed away on March 11, 2007, surrounded by loved ones. The daughter of Mae Simon, a star of the Yiddish Theater, and Herman Rubenstein, the ''actor's lawyer,'' she was a quintessential New Yorker who loved music, art, and almost nightly performances at Lincoln Center. She was an extraordinarily independent woman from the days when being one was uncommon. A journalist and public relations specialist, she ended her career as the Director of Publications at Kingsborough Community College of CUNY. She touched many lives by her generosity. She gave financial assistance, gifts, mementos, reminders and her famous New York Times personal clipping service to her friends and extended family. She loved Italy and into her eighties, her favorite, if unorthodox, choice of travel there was via freighter. She lived life her way, and spread an impish joy to those fortunate enough to share her space. She was dearly loved and will be sorely missed. A memorial service to celebrate her life will be held on April 15, 2007, at Manhattan School of Music, Greenfield Hall, 120 Claremont Avenue, NYC. Refreshments 10:0011:00 AM. Service 11:00 -Noon.
