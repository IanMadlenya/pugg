        STERN--Howard S. The officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Howard Stern, whose philanthropic vision helped strengthen the Jewish community on Long Island and beyond. Howard's sense of social responsibility illuminated his volunteer efforts, including his work as a trustee at the Parker Jewish Institute for Health Care and Rehabilitation. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Linda; to his children & grandchildren; and to the entire family. Morris W. Offit, President Susan K. Stern, Chair of the Board John S. Ruskay, Exec. V.P. & C.E.O.
