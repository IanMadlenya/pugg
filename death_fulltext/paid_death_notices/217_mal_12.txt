        TRAGER--William. The Rockefeller University community mourns with deep sadness the loss of our beloved colleague and friend, William Trager, a world renowned authority on parasitic diseases, insect physiology and tropical medicine who served the university with distinction for more than 70 years. A member of the US National Academy of Sciences, Dr. Trager was best known for his seminal contributions to our understanding of the malaria parasite. Dr. Trager opened the way to the cellular and molecular analysis of the malaria parasite through his breakthrough techniques for culturing the parasite in the test tube. He was a passionate collector of parasite strains and was deeply interested in genetic variation of the malaria parasite and the mechanisms that generated parasite diversity. He trained generations of parasitologists and his impact on malaria research is immeasurable. Dr. Trager loved the lab, loved doing experiments and was active at the bench into his late '80's. He was truly one of the seminal figures in malaria research of the twentieth century. He will be profoundly missed. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his family.
