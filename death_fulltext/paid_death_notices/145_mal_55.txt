        FROSCH-John. International Universities Press mourns the death of our most esteemed author John Frosch, M.D. and extends heartfelt condolences to his wife Ann and his family. A noted psychoanalyst, Dr. Frosch was the founder of the Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association as well as its editor and guiding force for the first twenty years. He was also the editor of the Annual Survey of Psychoanalysis and the author of ''The Psychotic Process'', the two volume work, ''Psychodynamic Psychiatry'', and of numerous scientific papers. He will be deeply missed by all.
