        SMITH-J. Morse. The Partners and Staff of Proskauer Rose LLP mourn the loss of J. Morse Smith, a close friend for some 30 years. He will be missed by all who knew him and especially by those of us who had the great pleasure of working with him. We extend our sympathies to Morse's wife, Marilyn, to his sons, Matthew, David and Christopher, and to his colleagues at H.J. Baker & Bro., Inc., which company he lead with vision and heart.
