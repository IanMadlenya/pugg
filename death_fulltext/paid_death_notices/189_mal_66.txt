        FRIEDMAN-Murray. There was a man! Once in a while, there is someone whose beautiful spirit and caring heart make a difference in the lives of so many. Generous to a fault, creative, wonderful husband to Evelyn, fabulous father to Jackie and Kathy, David and Dennis, loving grandfather to Jamie, Jodi, Jason and Kim, and faithful friend. We shall not see his likes again. Funeral service Monday October 6, 12 o'clock, Temple Sinai, Roslyn, NY.
        FRIEDMAN-Murray. In everyone's lives, they should have someone who loves them unconditionally. This is our grandfather. His love is unending. His warm heart, his soft hands and his love of life will always be a part of us. Jamie, Jodi, Jason and Kim
