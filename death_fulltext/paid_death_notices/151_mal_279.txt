        DAVEY-William, son of renowned American painter Randall Davey of Santa Fe and Florence McCormick of New York was a brilliant poet and writer, as well as a high-goal polo player and amateur astronomer. Presently Foreign Language Editor of The Long Story, his poems and stories have been published and translated world-wide. Always charmingly witty, he was educated at NYU, UC/Berkeley and the Sorbonne. In WW II he was a Combat Officer with Canadian-American Special Forces. He strove for perfection in literature and at 86 was preparing Bitter Rainbow for publication in Italy, translating previously published The Trial of Pythagoras into Greek for printing in Athens, and completing his life-long novel Splendor from Darkness. He and his wife Susan live near Keene, Virginia. The title of his first novel Dawn Breaks the Heart conveys the feeling of all who knew him.
