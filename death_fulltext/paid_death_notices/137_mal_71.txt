        KAZIN-Alfred. With profound sadness, the faculty, students and staff of the Graduate School and University Center of The City University of New York mourn the passing of Alfred Kazin, our great teacher and man of letters, who was Distinguished Professor Emeritus of English, as well as one the nation's most eminent literary critics. He loved literature and, above all, he loved the literary word, and he imparted this love and appreciation to generations of students and to countless readers of his own books and articles. He was a national treasure and our treasure as well. He was a proud ''walker in the city,'' and we will miss him greatly. Our deepest sympathy to his family. Frances Degen Horowitz, President
