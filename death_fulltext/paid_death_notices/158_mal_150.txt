        SHERWIN-Andrew S., M.D. It is with deepest sorrow that we announce the death of Andrew S. Sherwin, M.D., on March 11. Dr. Sherwin began practice on Long Island in 1943 and practiced for over 50 years in the specialty of obstetrics and gynecology. In his career he delivered over 12,000 babies on Long Island. He was an extraordinary husband, father and grandfather. Service will be held at Gutterman's Funeral Home, Woodbury, on Tuesday, March 14, at 12 noon.
        SHERWIN-Andrew, M.D. From day one he was a son not a son-inlaw, a brother not a brother-in-law, a magnificent physician not an M.D., loving and loved. Short of stature but a Giant. He was dedicated to his patients, wife, children and grandchildren, with a rare gift to become part of whatever he involved himself with. An example for all to cherish. Norman & Jo, Scott & Yvon Jeff & Audrey, Wendy & Howard Lori & Dan, and 12 Grandchildren
