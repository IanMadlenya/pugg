        GILMORE-Naomi. The National Treasury Employees Union notes with deep sorrow the death of one of our most effective and beloved leaders, Naomi Gilmore, former president of NTEU Chapter 99. Naomi's gifts of humor, intelligence, wisdom, warmth and kindness complimented her unrelenting pursuit of justice and fair play. She taught people how to assert and win their rights to be treated with dignity and respect, giving others the confidence to believe in themselves. This world is a far better place for her having lived. In bereavement, we embrace her husband Seth, and children Brian and Lisa, her daughter-in-law Janet, grandchildren Hannah, David and Rachael, her parents and sister.
