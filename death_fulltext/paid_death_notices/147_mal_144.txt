        KAHN-Sidney. The World Policy Institute, its Board of Advisors, its Senior Fellows, and its staff, and the New School University, note with great sadness the passing of Sidney Kahn. He was a devoted friend of the World Policy Institute, serving as a Trustee of the Institute from 1982 to 1990, and thereafter on the Publishing Board of the World Policy Journal. His contribution to the work of the Institute and the Journal was immeasurable. His loss will be deeply felt by all of us. Our sincerest sympathy is extended to his wife, Elizabeth, and his children, Anne, Jeffrey, Robin and Stephen, and his family.
