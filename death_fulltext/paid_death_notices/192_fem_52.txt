        KRAMER-Ruth Elizabeth, nee Zeitlin, died at home January 4, at the age of 90. She led an active and productive life characterized by optimism, interest in life, people and the world, and concern for those less fortunate. A paradigmatic good citizen and neighbor, Ruth will be sorely missed by all those who knew her, daughter Nancy Holmstrom, son-in-law Richard Smith, granddaughter Alexandra Holmstrom-Smith & sister Marjorie Willbach. Donations in her name may be made to the Brooklyn Public Library or Amnesty Int'l.
