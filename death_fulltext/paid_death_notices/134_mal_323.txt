        DRAYER-Mary Jane. On March 30, it will be fifty years since you left. You are always in my thoughts and, most often, in my expressions and sense of being. For all the times I didn't say I love you, Mom, I say it now. Sleep well and tell God I thank Him for making Mary Jane my mother. See you soon. Sonny
