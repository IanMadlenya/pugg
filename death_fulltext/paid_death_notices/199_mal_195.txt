        RUBINSTEIN--Amnon, died in New York City on August 5, 2003, after a brief illness. Much beloved by his family and many friends. A wonderful sense of humor and of the absurd accompanied his abundant generosity and kindness. He worked as a planner for Architectural Forum, I.M. Pei and NYC Department of Transportation. A quintessential New Yorker, he guided others through its streets, theatres and galleries. He is survived by his brother Don in Ann Arbor, nieces Tara, Alexa and Margalete, nephews Daniel, and Joshua and cousins Navah, Avi and Doron.
