        ELLENBOGEN--Dr. Robert. The officers, trustees, faculty and staff of the Alfred Adler Institute of New York and the Alfred Adler Center for Mental Health mourn the loss of our esteemed Executive Director and brilliant colleague, Dr. Robert Ellenbogen. As a teacher, mentor and director of the Institute, Bob was a pillar of our analytic community. He held a Ph.D in Psychology from New York University and served New York state for many years as a forensic psychologist. He was a past president and founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Psychoanalysis, and a board member of the American Board for Accreditation in Psychoanalysis. Bob was a treasured therapist and dedicated practitioner of the principles set forth by Alfred Adler. Our deepest sympathies go out to his sons Joshua and Benjamin. We will miss his tireless devotion, leadership and kindness. Fredrica Levinson, President Board of Trustees Barbara Berger, Dean Marcia Blecker, Director Mental Health Center
