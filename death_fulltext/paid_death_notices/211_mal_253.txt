        PLUMMER--Paul Calvin, Jr., died of cancer on August 15, after a courageous struggle. A life-long New Yorker, he graduated from Music and Art High School in 1948 and served in the U.S. Army in the Korean War, 1951-1952. In the 1960s he worked at the War Resisters League and Village Gate and was a convening presence at The Poetry Project at St. Mark's Church and Umbra. Paul appeared in Jonathan Miller's 1964 production of Robert Lowell's ''The Old Glory.'' He worked at CBS Publications and Columbia University's Senate and was president of the Commercial Chess League of New York and active in the Banker's Athletic League Chess Team, which will establish an annual tournament in his name. His partner of 30 years, Corinne Coleman; sister, Jacquiline Hewitt-Duval; daughters Noel and Kerry, granddaughter Sidney, son Kevin; nieces; and many friends will miss his elegance and dignity, quicksilver intelligence and wry humor.
