        HOROWITZ--Linda. Your untimely death leaves a void in our family's lives forever. We shall truly miss you, along with our parents, the late Murray and Irene Pergament, who both died within the past year, and our late sister, Sherri Koeppel. We grieve together with Richard, Jill and Jeff, and Kyle, Max, and Sam Koeppel who will never again have the pleasure to enjoy your company. Linda, your courage and strength was truly unimaginable. Your positive focus towards life was at all times inspiring. May we be blessed by your spirited and cherished memories all the days of our lives and may you find rest and peace throughout eternity. Randi and Bruce Scott, Cole, and Wesley
