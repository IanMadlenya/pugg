        FRIEDMAN-Andrew. We lost a dear friend in the WTC tragedy. A dedicated and caring husband and father, golf buddy, ''pool'' master, Yankee and Knick fan, and the most easy-going guy around. We will miss his physical presence but will never forget him. Our thoughts will forever be with Lisa, Michael and Daniel. Love, Richard, Karin, Daniel, Esther and Children
