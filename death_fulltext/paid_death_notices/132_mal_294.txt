After ordination in 1929, he served congregations in Ottawa, Youngstown, Ohio, Richmond, VA., and Buffalo, NY. In 1953, he assumed the pulpit of Rodef Sholom in Johnstown, PA. from which he retired in 1970. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his children, Joel and Joanne and all who were touched through his rabbinate. Rabbi David L. Lieber, President Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Exec.
