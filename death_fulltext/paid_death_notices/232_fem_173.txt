        CONNELLY--Elizabeth A. A longtime friend to United Cerebral Palsy of New York City, Betty was a frequent visitor to our center on Staten Island, always talking with and listening to our program participants, asking what she and her colleagues in government could do to make their lives more hopeful and increase their independence. As a result of her unwavering leadership and advocacy, New York State agreed to close all its institutions serving over 50,000 individuals with disabilities and create the community based settings that are the benchmark of our services today. The board and staff of UCP/NYC, and especially our consumers and families, mourn her loss and extend our deepest sympathies to her husband, Robert, and her entire family.
