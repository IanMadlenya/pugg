Gert and Arthur shared a fairy tale marriage of passion, laughter and devotion, always together and always madly in love. They radiated an aura of happiness and joy, whether exploring the world or a local art fair. Gert saw the best in people, with never a bad word to say. She loved her family deeply and exulted in their love and affection. An elegant, beautiful, compassionate woman of total loyalty, integrity and caring. She will be terribly missed but constantly remembered.
