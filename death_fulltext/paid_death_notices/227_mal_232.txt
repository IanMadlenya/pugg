        POWERS--Frederic B. Sound Shore Health System mourns the passing of our dear friend and colleague, Frederic B. Powers. Together with his family, Fred was a steadfast supporter of the Sound Shore Medical Center of Westchester and a devoted member of the Board of Governors. He served from 1967 to 1983, and returned in 1987 to the present. During this time he served as Vice Chairman in 1990, Chairman from 1994 to 1997, Chairman of the Sound Shore Health System from 1999 to the present, and on the Pinnacle Board from 1999 to the present as Chairman. His commitment to providing his community with the highest level of health care services by furthering the mission of the Medical Center will be forever remembered at Sound Shore. We will miss his guidance and support. Our deepest sympathies are extended to his wife, Ginny, and their children and grandchildren. Lawrence J. Ruisi, Chairman John R. Spicer, President and CEO
