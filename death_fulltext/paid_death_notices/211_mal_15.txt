        TURETSKY--Rabbi Arnold. The Solomon Schechter School of Westchester extends its condolences to the family of Arnold Turetsky and Temple Israel Center Community. Rabbi Turetsky was a leading figure in the conservative rabbinate, a vital force in the Jewish community of White Plains and a friend of the Solomon Schechter School. Rabbi Turetsky was a man of Torah whose passion was a lifetime spent learning and teaching. He was a spiritual guide to those who sought his wisdom and a teacher of Torah to those who sought his knowledge and understanding. We offer our deepest sympathy to Noemie, her children and grandchildren. May Rabbi Turetsky's memory be a blessing to our community. M. Mac Schwebel, Chairman James M. Dubin, Vice Chair Elliot Spiegel, Headmaster
