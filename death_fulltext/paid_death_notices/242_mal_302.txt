        MARSHALL--Robert P., 88, longtime resident of Bronxville, NY, died peacefully on March 27 at Essex Meadows, Essex, CT, where he had resided the last three years. He is survived by Mildred, his devoted wife of 64 years; his three children and their spouses, Bob and Siri Marshall of Deephaven, MN, Sara Gibson of New Canaan, CT, and Nancy Marshall and Andy Sareyan of Greenwich, CT; and his grandchildren, Serin Marshall, Tally and Katie Gibson, and Alex and Eliza Sareyan. A native of Pittsburgh, Bob was educated at Shadyside Academy, the Asheville School, Princeton (Class of 1940) and Harvard Business School. He served our country in World War II as Lt. (JG) in the U.S. Navy on the USS Capella in the Atlantic. After working at W.R. Grace, Morgan, Stanley and the International Nickel Co., Bob spent the better part of his career as an investment counselor for Scudder, Stevens & Clark, where his clients profited from his lifelong interest in the stock market. Passionate, but not obsessive, about sports, Bob belonged, at various times, to the Bronxville Field Club, St. Andrew's and Siwanoy Golf Clubs, the Ausable Club and Point o' Woods Association. Bob was active in community affairs in Bronxville, chairing the Community Fund and serving on the Library Board, among other volunteer activities. His family and all who knew him will miss him. A memorial service will be held at Christ Church, Bronxville, 2 pm. Wednesday, April 4. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Asheville School, 360 Asheville School Road, Asheville, NC 28806.
