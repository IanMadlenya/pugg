        CORBET-Sandra. We lost our dearest friend. Her honesty was a gift and a light in our lives. She was a guide for us on earth and beyond. She inspired and encouraged us to be better than our potential and then she would laugh and tell you ''I told you so.'' She was the definition of Chutzpah. Our hearts are with Steven and her family, who she loved so very much. Love all of her infinite friends and collegues who were lucky enough to know her.
        CORBET-Sandra. You will be sadly missed and never forgotten. For eleven years you have been more than a friend, more than an inspiration. You have been part of our family. Our thoughts go out to all your loved ones. Love, All of MCC Theater
        CORBET-Sandra. You made our dreams come true. We'll love you and remember you forever. Mark Sitley and Mary Knox
