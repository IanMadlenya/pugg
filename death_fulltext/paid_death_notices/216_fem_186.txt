        RATZKER--Paula. The Yeshiva University family is saddened by the passing of the widely admired matriarch of the Ratzker family whose children Menno (and Helen) Ratzker, grandchildren and great-grandchildren emulate her devotion to the Jewish people. As YU Guardians, they have devoted their leadership to the Yeshiva University High Schools and our undergraduate colleges. May the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel, President Norman Lamm, Chancellor Morry J. Weiss, Chairman Board of Trustees
