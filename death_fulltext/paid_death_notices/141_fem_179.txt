        COHEN-Eileen. On October 19, 1998. Adored wife of Bob, loving mother & mother-in-law to Bonni & David, Aimee, Devon and Erica, James & Cathy, Fred and Kathy, Mark, Charles and Jane, sister to Stan and loving grandmother to twenty wonderful children. She was the most loving, bravest, compassionate, unselfish, giving & forgiving person one could know. Eileen leaves a heartbroken, grieving and unconsolable army of family and friends. It was a great honor to have known her. She showed us the way. We will never see her kind again. We are so alone. Funeral at 12 noon, on Wednesday at Schwartz, 114-03 Queens Boulevard, Forest Hills.
