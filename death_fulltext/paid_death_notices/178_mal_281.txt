He strongly upheld his motto of providing ''the tools in the toolbox'' for our underprivileged youth. He also served on the Finance and Public Relations Committees. The Board and staff extend sincere condolences to Bob's family on their loss. James G. Nugent, President Douglas W. Wyatt, Vice President and the Lincoln Hall Board of Managers
