        EVERITT-Edgar Rogers. On May 5th, age 83 of Great Neck, New York. Beloved husband of Sylvia. Dear devoted father of Sue Hudgins, Judith and David. Loving grandfather of Charles, Karen and James Bohovich, Ethan and Seth Abrams, and Anthony & Gregory Everitt, and great grandfather of Kristin Bohovich. We will miss the calm strength of his presence, his kind gentleness and quick humor. He died peacefully at home-he left us too soon. Funeral services on Saturday at 10 AM, at Flushing Cemetery. The Fairchild Funeral Chapel, Manhasset.
        EVERITT-Edgar. In tribute to Ed Everitt, whose friendship greatly enriched our lives. We will always remember his quick wit and gentle spirit. Ruth and Jess Nemtzow
