        SLADE--John. We mourn the loss of a man of great stature and great accomplishments. He left behind the cruelties of pre-war Germany to build a life filled with a myriad of charitable deeds of kindness that benefited the totality of Jewish communal needs. A Benefactor of the Medical Center together with his wife Marianne, an Honorary Board member of the Nation al Women's Division who inspired her husband in his philanthropic activities, we will always remember with warmth and deep appreciation the dedication ceremony of the Slade Building that contains many of our outpatient clinics. The exemplary support provided by the Slades played a critical role in the growth and development of Shaare Zedek. Our heartfelt condolences to Mrs. Slade and daughters Barbara and Nicole. May the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
