        ESSROG-Rabbi Seymour L. We mourn with profound sorrow the sudden passing of our beloved colleague and past president (1998-2000). After two years in the active U.S. Army chaplaincy, he served his entire rabbinic career in Baltimore, first as rabbi of Beth Israel Synagogue for 30 years and then at Congregation Beth Shalom in Carroll County. At the time of his death, he was the rabbi of Congregation Adat Chaim. He was extremely involved in both the national and local Jewish communities and led 26 trips to Israel. Rabbi Essrog's service to the Rabbinical Assembly was extensive. He held every senior office in the RA. He is remembered for his deep caring for colleagues, his warmth and wonderful sense of humor. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Toby, children, Debra Jo, Michael and Rena, mother, Sadie, brothers and sisters-in-law, our colleagues, Rabbi Sheldon and Shulamith Elster and Rabbi William and Florence Berkowitz. Rabbi Reuven Hammer, President Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Executive VP The Rabbinical Assembly
