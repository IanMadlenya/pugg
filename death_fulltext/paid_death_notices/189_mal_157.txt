        ANNENBERG-Walter H. It is with great sorrow that the American Academy of Arts and Sciences mourns the death of Walter H. Annenberg, an Academy Fellow, who passed away October 1, 2002. Ambassador to Britain during the Nixon presidency, Annenberg was an art collector and renowned publisher whose visionary philanthropy has left an indelible mark on arts and educational institutions across the country. His generosity helped the American Academy launch its Visiting Scholars Program, created to nurture a new generation of scholars. The Academy extends its condolences to his wife, Leonore, his family, and all those who shared his passion for art, education, and international understanding.
