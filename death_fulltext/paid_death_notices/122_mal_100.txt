        MARCUS-Melvin G. With profound sorrow and an indelible sense of loss, The American Geographical Society records the sudden death of its Councilor (since 1980) and Vice President (since 1986) Melvin G. Marcus on March 2nd. His sound judgement, devotion, integrity, instinct for consensus, creative leadership, largeness of spirit, droll wit, respect for others, passion for field research, and zest for life will be deeply missed but will continue to inspire and influence those fortunate enough to have known him. Mel was to have received the Society's most venerable medal, the Cullum Geographical Medal, on March 13th. The award will be made as scheduled, but posthumously. Richard H. Nolte, Chairman Emeritus John E. Gould, Chairman Donald J. Lloyd-Jones, President Mary Lynne Bird, Executive Director
        MARCUS-Melvin G. In loving memory of our beloved brotherin-law, truest friend, intellectual companion, and life's inspiration. Richard Francis Allen and Diane Shaver Clemens, Berkeley, CA
