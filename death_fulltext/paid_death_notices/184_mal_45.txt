        GOLDWASSER-Martin. Formerly of Brooklyn Heights, passed away May 3, 2002 at age 95. He is survived by his wife Elizabeth S. Teter, son Hank, daughter Janet, grandchildren Jonathan, Missy Carvin and Douglass Dowty, and a sister, Esther Natt. He was preceded in death by his first wife, Paula Neumann in 1983, after forty-nine years of marriage. Martin graduated from Erasmus High School in Brooklyn, earned his Bachelor of Science degree from City College, and his DDS from New York University. He was a skilled and caring dentist, who over half a century, saw the children and the grandchildren of his first patients come to him for treatment in his practices in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Dr. Goldwasser gave of himself to others, volunteering many hours over the years at dental clinics in Brooklyn. He was a lifelong pacifist and Conscientious Objector, doing alternative service in state mental hospitals in Maryland during World War II. In later years, he spent many hours counseling young men about peaceful alternatives to military service in his work with the Metropolitan Board for Conscientious Objectors. His hobbies included stamp collecting, bird watching, and bicycling. He lived a full life, and will be remembered with love by us all. A memorial service will be held in June.
