        ROLFE--Justin B. (''Jud''), 88, of Teaneck, NJ (formerly of New Milford, NJ and Jupiter, FL), died Sunday, October 2, 2005. A natural entrepreneur who established several successful businesses during his career, he balanced his commitment to business and family with community service including leadership in founding and building the New Milford Jewish Community Center (now Congregation Beth Tikvah), serving in the New Milford Volunteer Ambulance Corps, as President of the New Milford Board of Education and as Vice President of the NJ State Board of Education. Beloved father of Robin Rolfe and Andrew Rolfe, father-in-law of Arnold Saltzman and Andree Bleshman Rolfe, grandfather of Jason, David and Evan Rolfe and brother of Honora Warren, he enriched all of their lives. Predeceased by his loving wife and partner of 57 years, Joan, he was blessed in his final year of life to be reacquainted with Helen Faulkner Rassmussen, his high school sweetheart, who he had not seen in 70 years. She was a wonderful and caring friend until the end. The funeral service will be officiated by Rabbi Steven Sirbu of Temple Emeth where he was a member, and held at Robert Schoem's Menorah Chapel, W-150 Rt. 4 East, Paramus, NJ, 11:30 AM, Thursday, October 6, 2005. Interment will be at Cedar Park Cemetery, Sanctuary of Abraham and Sarah, in Westwood, NJ, followed by visitation through the evening at the residence of Andrew Rolfe. The family suggests memorial contributions be made to the American Diabetes Association.
