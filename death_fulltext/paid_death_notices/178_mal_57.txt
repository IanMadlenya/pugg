        PEDERSEN-Charles Richard, 78. On October 26, 2001. Husband, father, grandfather. Born and raised in Havre, Montana, Dick was a Captain in the U.S. Army, serving in Europe in WWII. He later attended Harvard Law School on an academic scholarship. A member of the law firm Dewey, Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer and Wood, he was the Senior Vice President & General Counsel at American Can Company/Primerica until his retirement in 1988.
