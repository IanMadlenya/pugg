        ZOLAS--Dr. Edward, October 17, 2005. Concert pianist, music educator and beloved brother of Fimi Hatabian Zolas Cohen.
        $(6$)ZOLAS--Edward, Ph.D. We mourn the unexpected loss of our great piano teacher. He was part of the highest classical music tradition, one of only three pianists in the world who studied with both Isabella Vengerova and Rosina Lhevinne. His technique was a synthesis of the teaching of these great masters and his own creative genius. He brought breadth of human understanding and depth of technical expertise to his teaching. We will miss him.
