        SCHONBERGER--Beryl. He was a gentle, loving, witty soul who knew practically everything there was to know. Beryl was taken from us way too soon and we are all stunned. His heart gave way Tuesday. Service: Riverside, Amsterdam Ave at W. 76th Sunday, October 16 at 2 PM. ''Ave atque vale,'' my love. Robert F. Scherma
