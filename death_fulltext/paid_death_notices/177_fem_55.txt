        BERTELL-Mildred. Age 97. In Hallandale, FL. on October 4, 2001. We wish all people could celebrate Milly's life of love. All who had the privilege of sharing a few moments of her gracious being know what true generosity of spirit is. Her joy of life, her gift of humor, dignity and elegance were elements of the sweetness of her life. We have lost a most precious mother, grandmother, great grandmother and dear friend. Joyce, Leslie, Alan, David, Charlie and Briana, Michael and Diane, Lori and Richard, Steven and Gail, Sylvie and Norman, Morgan, Lindsey, Jessie, Jordan, Michaela, Jake and Kevin. Thank you dear Nana for coming into our lives. You were extraordinary.
