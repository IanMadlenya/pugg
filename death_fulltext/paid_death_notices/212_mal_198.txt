        FITZGERALD -- Patrick J., M.D. Pathologist, researcher and author, whose books included a history of cancer, succumbed to the disease on July 29, 2004. He died at his home in Sea Cliff, L.I., a week shy of his 91st birthday. In 1930, Dr. Fitzgerald rescued a man who had fallen through ice into the Little River in Massachusetts. For this he received the Carnegie Hero Medal and a scholarship, which launched him on a lifelong career in science. He was a pioneeer in autoradiology and former Chairman of Pathology at Downstate Medical Center and Memorial Sloan-Kettering. In 1985, he received the American Association of Pathologists' highest award for excellence, the Gold Headed Cane. A private memorial service will be held. Donations to commemorate his life may be sent to the American Cancer Society.
