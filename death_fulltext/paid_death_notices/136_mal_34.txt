        WASSERMAN-Jack. The Board of Directors and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Jack Wasserman: devoted husband, beloved father, champion of Jewish causes. A longtime supporter of UJA-Federation, he dedicated himself to those who needed his help. All who knew him were touched by his love, caring, and good nature. To his son, Bert, and the entire family, we extend our deepest sympathies. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair Louise B. Greilsheimer, President Edward Bleier, Marty Pompadur, and Martin Payson, Co-Chairs, Entertainment, Media & Communications Stephen D. Solender, Exec. V.P.
