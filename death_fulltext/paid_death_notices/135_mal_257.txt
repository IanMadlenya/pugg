        RYKOWSKI-Frank A. Died peacefully on April 22, 1998, after a yearlong battle with cancer. He is survived by his beloved children, Tony and Pamela Rykowski, his former wife, Jayne M. Kurzman, and a brother, Richard Rykowski. His extraordinary intellect and scholarship, sense of humor and wise counsel will be greatly missed. Services will be private. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that contributions be made to The Rockefeller University, 1230 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021, to support its research in the fields of cancer and alcoholism.
