        CRAVEN-Babette. The staff of the Billy Rose Theatre Collection at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts mourns the death on November 29th of their friend and colleague Babette (Babs) Craven who was a loyal volunteer for over 40 years. Her gentle nature, her devotion to theatre and her boundless knowledge will be deeply missed by all of us who worked with her.
