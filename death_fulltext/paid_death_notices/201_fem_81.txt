        HUTTON--Louise Gersen, the most extraordinarily loving, caring and giving wife, mother and daughter, who brought light and love to everyone she touched, lost her tenacious battle against Breast Cancer on October 16, 2003. Louise taught her children how to love and how to help others. Louise was the best friend anyone could ever have-there was nothing she would not do for her friends or for her family. She was loved and adored by her husband Tom, her mother Esther Woolf, her son Nathaniel Sharir, and her sons Logan Hutton and Jason Hutton, and countless friends. She will be forever remembered by all who loved her. What we keep in memory is ours cherished forever. Services Sunday 10am at ''The Riverside'' 76th St & Amsterdam Ave. Visiting hours Saturday 7-9pm.
