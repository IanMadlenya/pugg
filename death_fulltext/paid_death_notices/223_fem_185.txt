        STILL--Patricia. The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art note with sadness the death of Patricia Still, a generous benefactor. In anticipation of the opening of the Metropolitan's Lila Acheson Wallace Wing for modern art, she donated in 1986 ten canvases by her late husband, the noted American artist Clyfford Still. These paintings have been seen and enjoyed by millions of visitors. We extend our condolences to the entire family. Philippe de Montebello, Director Gary Tinterow Engelhard, Curator in Charge, Department of Nineteenth Century, Modern, and Contemporary Art
