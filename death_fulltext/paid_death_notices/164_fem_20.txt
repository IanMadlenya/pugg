        GOODYEAR-Mary. The volunteers and staff of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society wish to express deep sorrow on the passing of Mary Thompson Goodyear, 88, of New Orleans, LA, who died on September 8. Mary Goodyear served as a volunteer for numerous philanthropic and community service groups in New Orleans. Her work with the National MS Society began in 1971 as a member of the National Board of Directors. In 1973, as one of the local founders, she initiated the charter for the Louisiana Chapter of the Society and for 28 years continued to help the Chapter flourish; she was the Chapter's first ever Dinner of Champions honoree last November. She remained steadfastly dedicated to the National MS Society and its work. Her son Charles is presently a member of the National Board of Directors. Mrs. Goodyear is survived by her daughter, Mary Goodyear Glenn; three sons, Charles, David and Andrew; sixteen grandchildren and eighteen great-grandchildren. A memorial service will be held on September 30th at 10AM at Trinity Episcopal Church, 1329 Jackson Avenue, New Orleans, LA. The family asks that in lieu of flowers, contributions be made to the Louisiana Chapter of NMSS. National Multiple Sclerosis Society Richard B. Slifka Chairman of the Board Mike Dugan, General, USAF (Ret) President and CEO
