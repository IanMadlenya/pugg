        SALTER--Roberta Semple. September 17, 1910 -January 25, 2007. A woman of the 21st Century, who still loved her rotary phone. Wife of Harry Salter, daughter of Aimee Semple McPherson, and our dearly loved Granny. She visited nearly every corner of the world as a child with her mother, brother and grandmother and throughout her 96 years she never ceased to be a fearless explorer of Manhattan, the Caribbean and the world of people and books. She inspired and taught 3 subsequent generations of women by passing on her faith in life and her many strengths including patience and practicality, business savvy, a passion for reading, confidence, elegance and the ability to strike up an engaging conversation with anyone. Granny has always been, and will continue to be, a model of strength, independence, compassion and continuity for us all. Her light shines on. She is survived by her brother, Dr. Rolf Mcpherson of Los Angeles, her daughter, Victoria Salter, her granddaughters, Janice Kioko and Nora bromberg, her son-in-law, Francis Kioko and her great grandchildren, Emma, Harry and Ben, all of Manhattan. A private service was held. In lieu of flowers, donations can be sent to the Goddard Riverside Community Center.
