        DRINAN--Reverend Robert. Human Rights First mourns the Passing of Rev. Robert Drinan, a former member of our Board of Directors, who combined a passionate commitment to human rights with a determination to speak truth to power. His was a voice of conscience on issues ranging from the plight of Soviet Jewry to Central America, from Cuba to Darfur. We have lost a great leader and good friend.
