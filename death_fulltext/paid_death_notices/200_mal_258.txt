        HENLINE--Darrell. Cabaret and its music have lost one of their greatest champions with the passing of Darrell Henline, founder, publisher and editor-in-chief of Cabaret Scenes magazine. We will miss his passion for the highest standards of the art, and his warm devotion to cabaret and its community. Manhattan Association of Cabarets & Clubs (MAC)
