        SELIGMANN-William Benbow. On January 16, 2002, of injuries due to a fall fixing yet another leak on the roof, is survived by his wife of forty-six years, Ligoa Duncan; his daughter, Doree; his stepsons, Michel and Jean-Pierre Merle; his sister, Joan and George Hagner, and a medley of nieces, nephews, grandchildren, acquired extended family, friends and pets dispersed across the world. Not one for solemnity or dreary thoughts, we encourage happy reminiscing. Send us materials, stories and photos for a commemoration.
