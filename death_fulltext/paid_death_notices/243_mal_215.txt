        TOMPKINS--Rexford E. NADAP marks with great sadness the passing of one of its founders, Rexford E. Tompkins, age 90. NADAP's success is built upon the founders' foresight that education and employment play significant roles in reducing addiction and reviving the lives of individuals, families and communities. Mr. Tompkins also served as chairman of NADAP (formerly known as The National Association on Drug Abuse Problems, Inc.) from 1972 to 1978 and as interim president and CEO from 1996 to 1997. During this period, Mr. Tompkins volunteered his time and energies towards keeping NADAP viable and functional as it began transitioning into a new decade of services, under new leadership. In these roles he supported the agency through some of its most challenging and exciting periods of growth. Mr. Tompkins was dedicated to bringing economic opportunity to those in need with effective services and remained a dedicated and staunch supporter of NADAP and its mission of helping recovering substance abusers become selfsufficient and employed. His longtime commitment and leadership as a founder, former chairman and former president continued after his retirement and relocation to Florida. He will be greatly missed. John A. Darin President& CEO NADAP, Inc.
