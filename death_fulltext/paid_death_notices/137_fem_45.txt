        DICKMAN-Donna. The Board of Directors, members, and staff of the League for the Hard of Hearing mourn the untimely death of the Executive Director of the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf. Donna was a consummate professional, and advocate whose commitment to helping deaf and hard of hearing people and their families was unwavering. Her kindness, warmth, vision and leadership will be missed. We extend our sincere sympathy to her husband Neil, her son Eric, and her colleagues and friends. Keith D. Muller, ACSW Executive Director
