        RACAMIER - Henry. We deeply mourn the death of our dear friend and colleague, Henry Racamier. A leader in the arts and business, he was the best possible European as a founder and member of the Board of The New York International Festival of the Arts. To his wife, Odile, and children and families, we extend our deepest sympathy and condolences. This cherished friend will be greatly missed by us and all who were privileged to know him. Martin and Edith Segal
