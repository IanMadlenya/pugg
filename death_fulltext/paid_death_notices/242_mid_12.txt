        KENT--Miriam. Children of Arthur M. Sackler mourn the passing of Miriam Kent, whose loyalty, commitment, and never-ending energy served our father from 1952 until his death in 1987. For two decades she was Secretary of The Arthur M. Sackler Foundation and will be truly missed by its Staff and Board of Directors.
