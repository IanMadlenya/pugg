        OAKES-John B. Congregation Emanu-El of the City of New York records with sorrow the passing of John Oakes. A man of impeccable integrity, he combined in his personhood a brilliant intellect and a caring heart. His concerns were universal and through the power of his pen he championed the causes of the environment, while laboring for the eradication of every form of injustice. We remember, as well, the many years of dedicated service he gave as a member of our Board of Trustees. With his family and loved ones we mourn his passing, while giving thanks to God for the glory of his life. Surely the memory of John Oakes will endure as an inspiring blessing. Rabbi Ronald B. Sobel, Sr. Rabbi Robert A. Bernhard, President Herbert C. Bernard, Secretary
