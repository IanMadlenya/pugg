        GINSBURG-Frieda Abadi (Fritzie). On May 22, 2001. Beloved wife of the late Lewis, devoted mother of Annette Hidary and the late Esther Friedberg. Dear sister of Abe Abadi, Adele Sutton, Evelyn Rahmey, and Seymour Abadi. Loving grandmother of Mark and Jeffrey Friedberg, Jennifer Abadi, and Vanessa Hidary. Cherished great grandmother of Oakley, Zoe, Eva, and Lucy Friedberg. We mourn the loss of our incomparable Fritzie, a prolific artist who lived the vibrant colors of her palette.
