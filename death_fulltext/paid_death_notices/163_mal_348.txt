        de BOTTON-Gilbert. It is with sorrow that we note the passing of Gilbert de Botton, a long-time member of MoMA's Chairman's Council. A patron of the arts, he was particularly noted as an outstanding collector of modern and contemporary art, and in the last few years was a moving force in the creation of the Tate Modern. We send our deep sympathy to his wife, Janet, and his children. David Rockefeller, Chairman Emeritus Ronald S. Lauder, Chairman Agnes Gund, President Glenn D. Lowry, Director The Museum of Modern Art, NY
