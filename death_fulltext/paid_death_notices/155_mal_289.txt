        BRAUER-Paul H.. M.D. The Trustees, Faculty and Staff of Mount Sinai School of Medicine and The Mount Sinai Hospital of Mount Sinai NYU Health mourn the passing of our friend and esteemed colleague, Paul H. Brauer, MD, lecturer in the Department of Psychiatry, who was associated with Mount Sinai for more than five decades. A graduate of the University of Michigan School of Medicine, Dr. Brauer joined the attending staff of The Mount Sinai Hospital in 1946 and subsequently served on the faculty of the Mount Sinai School of Nursing and the New York School of Social Work at Mount Sinai. On the establishment of Mount Sinai School of Medicine in 1966, he was appointed Associate Clinical Professor of Psychiatry, and served with distinction until his retirement in 1982. Admired as both teacher and clinician for his dedication to students and patients, he will be remembered most fondly, and he will be sorely missed. We extend our sincere sympathy to his wife, Arlette, his son, Alan, his daughter, Janet Weinberger, to his grandchildren and to the entire family. Helene L.
