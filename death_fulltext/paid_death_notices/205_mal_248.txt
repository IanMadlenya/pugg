        MULLER--Andre. 93, former Director of Latin American affairs for Nestle, devoted husband of the late Helen Maguire Muller and brother of Micheline Lucas, Christiane Tyson, and Elyette Taylor passed away on February 18, 2004 in Lausanne, Switzerland. He was the dedicated and kind-hearted father of Lucienne, Edouard, and Jacqueline and the dearly beloved grandfather of Dalia, Djamila, Marie-Jeanne, and Rosalie. We mourn his absence with great sorrow. We loved him living and we love him still.
