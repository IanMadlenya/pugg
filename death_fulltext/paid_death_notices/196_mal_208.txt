        LAUBY--Paul T. The trustees and staff of the United Board for Christian Higher Education in Asia are deeply saddened by the death of Dr. Paul T. Lauby, who served as its general secretary from 1970 to 1989. Prior to his leadership of the United Board, Dr. Lauby spent 16 years as a missionary educator at Silliman University in the Philippines, serving on the faculty and as dean of the Divinity School, and as the university's vice president for academic affairs. The mission and work of the United Board continues to be influenced by the legacy of his vision, leadership, and commitment, and we extend our deepest sympathies to his family.
