        DIMOND--Dora. The Board and staff of Citymeals-onWheels send strength and sympathy to our much loved Executive Director Marcia Stein and her family on the loss of her mother Dora Dimond who passed away at age 96. Dora was a poet, feisty, adventurous and charming, a lovely woman whose life and spirit inspired both her daughters. The passion and emotion with which Marcia Stein has embraced the cause of our city's homebound elderly reflects that strong bond and is a tribute to Dora Dimond.
