        DENNIS-Gertrude Weyhe. The Board of Directors and the members of the International Fine Print Dealers Association sadly note the passing of our colleague. Gertrude was a founding member of the IFPDA. With her father, the Weyhe Gallery has served the field of fine prints with distinction since 1919. We extend our deepest condolences to her daughter Deborah Kiley and brother Arthur Weyhe. Robert Newman, President
