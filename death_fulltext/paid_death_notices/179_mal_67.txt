        BUNCHER-Jack. The officers, Board of Directors and staff of The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) mourn the passing of our friend and mentor, Jack Buncher. His vision and energy continue to enrich the lives of young Jewish leaders and assure the future of Jewish life in communities around the world. Jack was the founder and visionary who made possible the creation of the Buncher Leadership Program, an all-important tool in the development of Jewish leaders on every continent. Sponsored by the Buncher family through the United Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, Jack's program has enabled more than 220 lay and professional leaders to acquire the skills they need to help their communities flourish. Through the continuous support of the Buncher Foundation, Jack witnessed the positive impact of the Buncher Program on the lives of Jews in developing communities the world over. The future of these Jewish communities is Jack's true legacy. Eugene J. Ribakoff, President Jonathan W. Kolker, Chairman Michael Schneider, Exec. VP
