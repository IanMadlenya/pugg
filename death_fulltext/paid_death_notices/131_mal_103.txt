        VAUS-James Arthur, Jr. Internationally-known electrical wizard and worker with youth, died December 1, 1997, at Augusta Medical Center, Fisherville, VA after an illness of several years. Vaus was born into a minister's family in Los Angeles, California, on February 17, 1919, and grew up in Texas. Following a military career he became a wiretapper for organized crime, but in 1949 at age 30 he became Christian, committing his life to Christ at the Greater Los Angeles Billy Graham crusade. For the next nine years, with his wife Alice, he traveled on four continents witnessing with the aid of electrical inventions to the change Christ had made in his life. A film ''Wiretapper'' resulted. In 1958 he launched Youth Development, Inc., a ministry to troubled youth in Spanish Harlem of New York City, where he was used to lead many gang members into Christian service. In the years that followed he established numerous youth services around the country, moving his headquarters to San Diego, CA where he established a nationwide youth crisis hotline, 1800-HIT-HOME, that still receives thousands of calls monthly. Vaus' latest ministry originated from a donated property in the mountains of Virginia in 1995. He established a retreat center for youth and was there at the time of his death. He is survived by his wife, Alice (whose book described their early travels), five children, ten grandchildren, all of Virginia, and two sisters, Elizabeth Rothenberger and Virginia McLaughlin of California. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that memorial contributions be sent to Youth Development, Inc., Head Waters Lodge, Head Waters, Virginia 24442. A farewell service was held at Head Waters Lodge on Thursday, December 4, with burial at Head Waters Cemetery.
