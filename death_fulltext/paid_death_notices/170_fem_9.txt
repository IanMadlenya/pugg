        GLATZER-Henriette. The American Group Psychotherapy Association mourns the passing of Dr. Henriette Glatzer, one of its most esteemed members. A former President and Distinguished Fellow of the Association, she was the first woman and the first psychologist to serve as its chief elected officer. Her seminal scholarly achievements contributed enorously to the advancement of the theory and practice of group psychotherapy. She will be sorely missed.
