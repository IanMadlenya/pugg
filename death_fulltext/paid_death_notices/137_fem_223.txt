        SNYDER-Beatrice. The Jewish Theological Seminary family records with sorrow the death of Beatrice Snyder, a staunch supporter of JTS for many years. The generous contributions she and her husband, Harold, made to Jewish education and JTS will live on through the students whose Jewish education they made possible. May her memory be for a blessing.
