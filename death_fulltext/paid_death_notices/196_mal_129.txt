        GROSS-Jack. The officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York note with sadness the passing of Jack Gross, a cherished friend of UJA-Federation. Devoted to supporting Jewish and humanitarian causes, Jack was a guiding force in the formation of the Bankruptcy and Reorganization Group of the Lawyers Division, and served for many years as the group's chair. We extend our deepest sympathies to his entire family. Larry Zicklin, President Morris W. Offit, Chair of the Board John S. Ruskay, Exec. V.P. & C.E.O.
