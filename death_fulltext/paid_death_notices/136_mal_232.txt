        WEAVER-Richard. The Board of Directors of the American Theatre Wing deeply mourns the death of their beloved and esteemed colleague, Richard Weaver. He loved the theatre and was widely respected for his knowledge and extensive background in the industry. We were fortunate to have him serve as treasurer on our Board of Directors. For all the years that he served, he was not only a most supportive & concerned member but also extremely forward looking. Dick was an innovative force within the Wing, for example, our very popular and successful ''Introduction to Broadway'' Program was his inspiration. I will greatly miss his realistic and wise counsel. Our love and sympathy goes to his wife, Jill, and his family. American Theatre Wing Isabelle Stevenson, President
