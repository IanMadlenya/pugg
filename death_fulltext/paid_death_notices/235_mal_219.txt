        HOFFMAN--Robert. L & M Arts joins the entire art world in regretfully saying goodbye to Robert Hoffman. He and his wife, Marguerite, built a terrific and personal collection of contemporary masterpieces in which each acquisition was thoughtfully made. This superb collection was given to the Dallas Museum of Art, an act of generosity that inspired a group of friends to do likewise. This act immeasurably enriched the cultural treasures of their beloved hometown. Robert Hoffman's kindness and generosity marked every aspect of his brief life. His extreme intelligence and wry humor showed in everything he so brilliantly undertook. Robert, we will deeply miss you. Robert Mnuchin Dominique Levy
