        HAMMERSTEIN-James B. The cast and companies of ''I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change'' and ''Over The River And Through The Woods'' mourn the sudden passing of our loyal friend, mentor, partner and producer. As a producer, Jamie embodied the ideal his father once described as, ''An idealist, a realist, a practical dreamer, a sophisticated gambler, and a stage-struck child.'' He was everything we could have wanted him to be. We will miss him greatly. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family, Dena, Simon, Andrew, Will and Jennifer as well as to the directors, writers, and actors for whom he cared so deeply.
