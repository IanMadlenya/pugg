        CRAWFORD-Morris D., Jr. TIAACREF expresses deep sorrow on the passing of Rusty Crawford, former Chairman and CEO of The Bowery Savings Bank, and a valued member of the TIAA Board of Trustees from 1965 through 1985. Rusty's expertise contributed importantly to the deliberations of the TIAA Board's mortgage investment, nominating and audit committees over these years. We remember Rusty for his devoted service to TIAA-CREF, for his warmth and friendship and for his distinguished civic, business and professinal leadership in the tristate area. TIAA-CREF joins with many others in offering heartfelt condolences to his family.
