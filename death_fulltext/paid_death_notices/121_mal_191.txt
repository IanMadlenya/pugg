        BARTELS-John R. The Board of Regents and Administration of The Long Island College Hospital mourn with great sorrow the death of our friend, distinguished Regent and benefactor, The Honorable Judge John R. Bartels. Judge Bartels joined the hospital's board of regents in 1948, and served the board as secretary and governmental advisor for 41 years. His wide legal expertise was a key factor in financing the hospital's successful $160 million modernization program. The 15 year effort resulted in the hospital's present campus culminating this past January, with the opening of the hospital's parks and parking project. Judge Bartels was an anchor of focused vision and support who truly helped the hospital in its mission to serve the people of Brooklyn. We extend our sincere condolences to his sons John Jr. and William. Joseph L. Broadwin, Chairman Board of Regents Donald F. Snell, Pres. and CEO The Long Island College Hospital
