        DEAN-Sidney W., Jr. The family and friends of Sidney W. Dean, Jr., will always remember him with love as father, friend, mentor and exemplar of a life well lived. He departed this life January 24, at his home in Greenwich Village, age 91. A lifelong champion of civil liberties, active in the Democratic Party and ADA, he was also active in community affairs and served over 30 years as trustee of the City Club of New York. His longtime friend and fellow City Club trustee Joel Harnett praised Sidney's ''almost religious respect for the First Amendment.'' A memorial service will be held Sunday, February 2, time and location to be announced.
