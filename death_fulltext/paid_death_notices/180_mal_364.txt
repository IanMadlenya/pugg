        SCHIFF-Stuart. Amy and I will miss you terribly. We worked closely together for 14 years and we enjoyed a lasting friendship for an additional 12 years. We grieve for Barbara and for Stephen and we will always fondly reflect smilingly on the hundreds of times we spent laughing together over those 26 years. Doodles, it's hard to believe that you are really gone; and I hope that if you happen to run into Eddie, that you will remind him that he still owes us money. With all of our love, Amy and Ronnie Goldberger
        SCHIFF-Stuart. On behalf of the Young Men's/Women's Real Estate Association, we extend our condolences to the Schiff family. Stuart was an active member who served on the Board of Governors and was a good friend. We will miss him. The Board of Governors Young Men's/Women's Real Estate Association of New York
        SCHIFF-Stuart. I will miss your smile, your loyalty, your consistency. Most of all, I will miss your appreciation of everything big and small. Stephen B. Siegel
