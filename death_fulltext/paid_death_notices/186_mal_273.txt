        CARROLL-Frank D., M.D., Emeritus Professor. The Department of Ophthomology mourns the loss of our esteemed colleague Emeritus Professor Frank D. Carroll, M.D. on July 24, 2002.

Our sympathies are with his family: Shirley; Ted, Maureen and Edward; Anne, Alissa and Rebecca. Myles Behrens, M.D. Stanley Chang, M.D. Edward Harkness Eye Institute Columbia University
