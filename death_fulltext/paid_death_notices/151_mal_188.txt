        KIRKLAND-Lane. The Board of Directors and staff of the National Committee for Labor Israel mourn the passing of Lane Kirkland. Working with the National Committee for Labor Israel, and through the labor movement, the former president of the AFL-CIO was an indefatigable supporter of a strong and democratic Israel. As an example of labor solidarity, and to help foster democracy in the Middle East, he strengthened ties between the US labor movement and Israel's General Federation of Labor-Histadrut. We extend our sympathies to his wife, Irena, and to the entire family. National Committee for Labor Israel Jay Mazur, President Jerry Goodman, Exec Director
