        UMANSKY-Charles. Manhattan Day School/Yeshiva Ohr Torah records with profound sorrow the passing of Charles Umansky, assistant principal for general studies from 1998 to 2000.

May the family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Rabbi Mordechai Besser, Principal George Karasick, President Elliot Gibber, Chairman of the Board
