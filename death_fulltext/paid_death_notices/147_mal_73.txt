        JOSEPHS-George. Boys Town Jerusalem mourns with profound sorrow the passing of a most cherished member of its extended family. George's love of his fellow man, the Jewish people and the state of Israel was both legendary and exemplary. Together with his beloved Miriam, his soul mate in life and partner in Tzedakah, he worked tirelessly to improve the quality of life for others. George first visited Boys Town almost three decades ago, and inspired by the school's mission of turning young boys from limited backgrounds into young men with limitless futures, he founded the Bergen County Friends of Boys Town. George's caring, warmth, friendship, humor and unparalleled dedication to so many noble causes will endure as a lasting tribute. Heartfelt condolences to the entire family. Josh S. Weston, Chairman Michael J. Scharf, President Rabbi Moshe Linchner, Dean Rabbi Ronald L. Gray, Exec V.P.
