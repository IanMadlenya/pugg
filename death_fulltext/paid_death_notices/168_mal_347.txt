        SHAPIRO-Irving. The Anti-Defamation League mourns the passing of our dear friend, Irving Shapiro, a member of our National Commission. A longtime Chair of ADL's Middle East Committee, Irving was dedicated to peace and security for the Jewish State. A committed and steadfast leader for thirty years, he worked tirelessly to further ADL's agenda. We will miss his wise counsel and good humor. We extend our condolences to his wife, Dorothy, his daughters, his brother, Sidney, and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Glen A. Tobias National Chairman Abraham H. Foxman National Director
