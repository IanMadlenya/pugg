        KOGEN--David. The Jewish Theological Seminary deeply mourns the death of Rabbi David Kogen, Vice Chancellor Emeritus and esteemed member of the community. His tenure at JTS spanned over four decades where he served under Chancellors Finkelstein, Cohen and Schorsch and dedicated his life to serving the seminary. He was a man whose dignity and fairness touched all who knew him. His impact on JTS, our students, faculty and staff was tremendous and he will forever be remembered as a mentor and friend to generations of the JTS family. May his wife, Dena, children and grandchildren be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Ismar Schorsch, Chancellor Gershon Kekst, Board Chairman
