        FLUG-Fortunee. Of Palm Beach, FL. by way of Syria and NYC lives on in the hearts of her beloved husband Alfred, children Carol and Robert, grandchildren Owen, Raquel and Danielle, great-grandchildren Juliette and Alexander, and brother Kenneth Husney. Each day we smell gardenias, hear the song ''Summertime,'' taste stuffed grape leaves and take in the sunset-we know you are present.
        FLUG-Fortunee. Mother of my life long and best friend, Robert. She was a wonderful wife, mother, grandmother and friend. Her legacy will be her children, grandchildren and her great-grandchildren to whom she gave all the love she had to give. They will most assuredly spread her love. I know that the love his mother gave him will never die. Neil S. Hirsch
