        JOSEPH-Peter T. American Ballet Theatre mourns with profound sadness, the tragic and untimely loss of Peter T. Joseph. Since joining the Board of Governing Trustees of ABT in 1991, Peter has been an extraordinary inspiration to the dancers, staff and his fellow trustees alike. With limitless energy and boundless optimism, Peter took on the challenge of leading ABT in 1993. The vigor and quality of the Company today are the result of Peter's singular personal investment and commitment and his sheer determination throughout these past five years as ABT's Chairman. His passion for both the visual and performing arts, and his affection and admiration for creative artists will long be remembered. We extend our deepest sympathies to Peter's family-his wife, Wendy Evans Joseph, children, Danielle and Nicholas, mother, Evelyn Joseph, and sisters and brothers, Michael, Thomas, Evelyn, Eleanor, and Margaret Joseph, Mary Nyod and Kathleen Reinhart; and to the entire staff of Rosecliff Inc. Hamilton E. James, Chairman Anne M. Tatlock, President Kevin McKenzie, Artistic Director Michael M. Kaiser Executive Director
        JOSEPH-Peter. The Board of Governors and Director of the American Craft Museum are deeply saddened by the untimely and tragic loss of Peter Joseph. Peter was a pioneer in the field of contemporary hand-crafted furniture and his vision and personal patronage of so many artists will have a profound and lasting effect on our field. Our deep sympathy and love to Wendy, Danielle and Nicholas.
