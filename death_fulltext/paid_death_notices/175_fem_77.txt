She survived the depression and WWII in Hungary, but fled Hungary with her family in 1956 during the Hungarian Revolution.

She had multiple scientific publications and was a member of The NY Academy of Sciences, and Sigma Xi. Since 1985, Hanna (Anyu to us) lived in Pasadena, CA, with her daughter and her family, helping to raise two children and sharing her life experiences. She is survived by her children Andrea and Joseph, their spouses Roger and Carol, and her grandchildren Nicky, Katie, JoJo, Steve, Mike, Nick, and Will, all of whom have fond and loving memories of her. We all miss her very much. In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to Camp Laurel, PO Box 93204, Los Angeles, CA 90093.
