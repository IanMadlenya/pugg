        CATTON-Eddie. The officers and leadership of UJA-Federation of New York are profoundly saddened by the untimely loss of Eddie Catton. His generosity and his commitment to world Jewry as a visionary leader of the Sephardic Jewish community will long be remembered. He was a founding Board member and the second President of the Sephardic Community Center, a longtime Chair of UJA-Federation's Syrian Sephardic Campaign, and a former member of the Board of UJA-Federation. We extend our sincere sympathies to his wife, Frieda; his daughter, Rochelle; his daughter and son-in-law, Melanie and Stephen Shalam; his son and daughterin-law, Sammy and Shirley; his brother, Harry; and his mother and father, Rachel and Sam. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair James S. Tisch, President Stephen D. Solender, Exec V.P. Alan Mond, Director, Heritage Campaigns
