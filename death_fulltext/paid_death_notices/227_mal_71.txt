        FALLON--John W. In his ''Pompila'', Robert Browning charged: No work begun shall ever pause for death! His words, however, might impede so profound a tribute for a lesser figure on the horizons of our journey. Not, however, for John Fallon, Board Chairman (Retired) of both Daytop Village, Inc. and Daytop International, Inc. Drawn from the ranks of elite leadership of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, he brought to the table of Daytop's concerns incomparable energy and dedication to the task of recovery of this Town's young. For three decades, we walked in the shadows of his immense devotion to our Cause. The march of the years will note the passing of all of us but few with such monumental impact upon our journey. May the good Lord welcome him home and may He grant solace and strength to his beloved Joan and the Fallon Family. (Msgr.) William B. O'Brien, President Daytop Village, Inc.
