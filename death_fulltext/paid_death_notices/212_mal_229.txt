        BARNES--Edward Larrabee. The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art mourn the loss of our Trustee Edward Larrabee Barnes. Ed was of a generation of architects who were steeped in modernism at Harvard and inspired by Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer. He is often first identified with the museums he designed-The Walker Art Center, the Sarah Scaife Gallery at Carnegie Mellon, the Dallas Museum of Art, and the Armand Hammer chief among them. He created beautiful, light-infused spaces in which architecture never upstages art, and through which visitors can flow easily. He also was one of the first modernist to bring a sensitivity to the local and the regional in his work, utilizing indigenous stone or wood to articulate his spare vocabulary. This tenet is perhaps most evident in his Haystack Mountain School of Arts and Crafts on Deer Isle, Maine. This country is filled with lasting monuments to Ed's genius, from huge projects like the IBM headquarters in New York, to private commissions done on a domestic scale. We especially extend our sympathies to his wife, Mary, who was our colleague in MoMA's Department of Architecture and Design in the 1940s, as well as to his son, his grandaughters, and the entire family. David Rockefeller, Chairman Emeritus Agnes Gund, President Emerita Ronald S. Lauder, Chairman Robert B. Menschel, President Patricia Phelps de Cisneros, Chairman, Trustee Committee on Architecture and Design Glenn D. Lowry, Director Terence Riley, The Philip Johnson Chief Curator of Architecture and Design The Museum of Modern Art, N.Y.
        BARNES--Edward Larrabee. The Board of Trustees and members of the Katonah Museum of Art mourn the loss of our dear friend and the architect of our elegant building. We convey our heartfelt sympathy to his wife and artistic partner Mary Barnes & their family.
