        GARDNER--Janet H. On November 25, 2005, at age 68. Loving wife of Allan, whose bold proposal after a sixweek courtship led to 44 rich and rewarding years together, two children and six grandchildren. She was elegant, opinionated, extraordinarily well-read, witty in person and on paper, and interested in everything. She was a loyal and devoted friend, respected editor, gracious hostess and expert knitter. Her many talents notwithstanding, Janet's most cherished role was as mother to Elisabeth and Andrew, motherin-law to Jeffrey Ostrow and Kimberley Harris, and grandmother to her beloved Robbie, Annabel and Charlotte Ostrow, and Kyle, Jake and Juliet Gardner. Funeral at Congregation B'nai Yisrael, Armonk, NY, Tuesday, November 29, at 11 am.
        $(6$)GARDNER--Janet. Dearest friend of a lifetime--the days we thought would be without end are over too soon. We will cherish her memory forever, and give our deepest love always to Allan, Elisabeth and Jeffrey, Andrew and Kim, and the grandchildren. She was the best. Penny and Pete Costigan
