        GLUECK-Louis. The Maimonides Medical Center family, Board of Trustees, administration, medical staff and workers mourn the loss of Louis Glueck, our esteemed Honorary Chairman and Life Trustee. A recipient of the hospital's highest honor-the Jack R. Aron Medal-Mr. Glueck demonstrated an insatiable appetite for making life better for his community, devoting himself to numerous organizations and charities. Mr. Glueck's greatest assets were the strength of his reputation and his leadership abilities. The breadth of his compassion reached all areas of people's lives and touched on health care, education and shelter. He was a true friend to the Medical Center and its staff and will be sorely missed. His outstanding achievements and contributions to his community will forever be appreciated. We extend our sincere condolences to his wife Edith and the entire Glueck family. Martin D. Payson, Chairman Stanley Brezenoff, President Pamela S. Brier, Executive V.P.
