        SAFIR-Florence B., 89, passed away October 4 in San Diego. Florence was a native New Yorker. She was born in Greenwich Village, and lived on West 72nd Street for more than 65 years. For over 30 years, ''Florrie'' was a school secretary at P.S. 87. In the usually anonymous city, strolling down Broadway with Florrie was an unusually neighborly experience. Elementary, junior-high, and high school kids smiled and waved. Adults stopped to chat. Some, were parents of P.S. 87 kids; some even were once P.S. 87 kids themselves, now with children of their own. Everyone remembered Florrie. As will all of us: her son, Andrew; sister, Ruth; and daughter-in-law, Marcia. There will be a private burial Sunday, October 17. Anyone wishing to express condolences, or share memories can contact Andy Safir, 3800 Carbo Court, La Mesa, Calif. 91941.
