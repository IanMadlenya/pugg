        CARPENTER--H. Daniel. NADAP marks with great sadness the passing of Dan Carpenter, age 95. Dan joined NADAP in 1973 serving as president and CEO from 1973 to 1984. He then served as Board member from 1984 to 1995. In these roles he supported the agency through some of its most challenging and exciting periods of growth. Dan remained a dedicated and staunch supporter of NADAP and its mission of helping recovering substance abusers become self-sufficient and employed. His long time commitment and leadership as a Board member and former president continued after his retirement and relocation to Arizona. He will be greatly missed. John A. Darin, President
