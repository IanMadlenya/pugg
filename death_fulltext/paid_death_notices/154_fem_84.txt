        MONAS - Pauline Levy. The Board, staff and volunteers of DOROT, Inc. extend deepest condolences to our longtime supporter and Honorary Board member, Martin Monas, on the passing of his beloved mother. Her belief in community involvement and devotion to family were evident in Mr. Monas' dedication of gifts to DOROT in honor and memory of family members, including ''Sonny's Garden'' in memory of his uncle, Solomon Levy, o.b.m. We mourn the loss of Mrs. Monas, a precious and inspiring presence, and express heartfelt sympathy to her son, Martin; her daughter, Barbara Herman; her brother, Abe Levy; her sisters, Frieda Spiegel and Edna Ginsberg; her grandchildren, Shari and Lowell Frey and Barry Herman; and her greatgrandchildren, Allison and Sam Frey. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Anne E. Heyman, President Renee Adler Ascher, Board Chair Marilyn Katz, Hon. Board Chair Vivian Fenster Ehrlich, Exec Dir
