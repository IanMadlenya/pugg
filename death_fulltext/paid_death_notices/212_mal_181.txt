        ADAMS--Eddie. 1933-2004 With deep sorrow we mourn the loss of extraordinary photographer Eddie Adams. In his 45-year career, Eddie won hundreds of awards from his peers for his insightful and often startling photos that documented the human experience. Among his most poignant images were those of children and families affected by neuromuscular diseases, highlighted on the covers of Parade magazine. It is ironic that Eddie himself became the victim of one of those diseases. We are deeply grateful for the prominence he bestowed on Lou Gehrig's disease and for the help he brought toward finding a cure.
