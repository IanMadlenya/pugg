        MACK--JohnThe Juilliard School mourns the passing of John Mack, one of the most distinguished oboe performers and teachers of our time. As the principal oboist of the Cleveland Orchestra, he helped set the standard for orchestral oboe performance in the United States and around the world. An alumnus of The Juilliard School and a member of the oboe and chamber music faculties since 2001, he was a trusted colleague and a deeply respected mentor to generations of oboists. We send our condolences to his entire family. Joseph W. Polisi, President Stephen Clapp, Dean
