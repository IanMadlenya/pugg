        SPEISER-Marvin. The Baruch College community and the Trustees of the Baruch College Fund record their profound sorrow at the loss of Marvin M. Speiser '46, a lifelong friend and supporter of the College. A Trustee Emeritus and a founding member of the Baruch Fellows Program, Marvin, along with his wife Laura, was a champion of the arts at an institution renowned for educating business leaders. His legacy to Baruch also includes the Speiser Chair in Economics and Finance. Marvin's sense of humor and unstinting service to his alma mater will be sorely missed. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife and family. Ned Regan, President, Baruch College Larry Zicklin, President, The Baruch College Fund
