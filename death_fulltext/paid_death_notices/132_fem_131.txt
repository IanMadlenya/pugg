        RUBINOFF-Lillian Rosenthal. The administration, faculty, students and boards of the Jewish Theological Seminary record with sorrow the death of Lillian Rosenthal Rubinoff. Billie was a staunch supporter of the Seminary for more than three decades through her devoted service to the Torah Fund Campaign. Her contributions to the Seminary and Jewish education will live on through the establishment of the Billie Rosenthal Rubinoff Memorial Scholarship for Women. May her memory be for a blessing. Ismar Schorsch, Chancellor Gershon Kekst, Board Chairman
