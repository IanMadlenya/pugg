        HAMMERSTEIN - William. The Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization has lost a true leader and friend. Bill gave unselfishly to the family firm; he was knowledgeable yet curious about every aspect of the organization, a teacher and a student to the very end. He was wise-about business, about people, and about the theater. He was, above all, a wonderful man, much loved by us all. He will be sorely missed. Our thoughts are with Jane-Howard and his daughters.
