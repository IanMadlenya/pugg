        RUEBHAUSEN -- Oscar M. The Bennington College Board of Trustees, faculty and staff deeply mourn the death of Oscar Ruebhausen who served as a Bennington College Trustee for fifteen years--serving as Chairman for seven years. Oscar was a distingished and accomplished man whose inspired leadership had a profound impact on the college. His unstinting generosity to Bennington and his longtime friendship will be sorely missed. We are grateful to have been touched by his extraodinary vision and character.
