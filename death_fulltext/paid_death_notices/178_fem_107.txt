        ELSTEIN-Alice L. Never without a smile, she died peacefully on October 28th. She collected friends and kept them for life. One of the funniest people we ever met, she wrote colorful, witty work. Honest, generous, accepting, she looked for the best in people. Graduated with honors from Queens College at age 80. Husband Bernard, sons Paul and Kenneth, grandsons Robert, David, and Daniel, and other family and friends will always miss her.
