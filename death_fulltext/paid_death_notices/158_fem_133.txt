        FRIEDMAN-Debby. The Sh'or Yoshuv Institute, its Kehilla and greater Jewish community of Far Rockaway/5 Towns, mourn the passing of Mrs. Debby Friedman, cherished wife of our esteemed President, Maurice Friedman, and mother and grandmother, both to her children and grandchildren and the extended Sh'or Yoshuv family. Devoted founding members of our yeshiva, the Friedmans personified the dictum in Ethics of our Fathers, ''let your house be a meeting place for sages'' ''1:4,'' for the yeshiva was virtually born in their living room more than thirty years ago. Their generosity and on-going involvement have nurtured the growth and development of the Sh'or Yoshuv community, and Mrs. Friedman's warmth and compassion will be deeply missed and fondly remembered. Heartfelt condolences to the entire family. Rabbi Naftali Jaeger, Rosh Hayesheva Rabbi Avrohom Halpern, Menahel Rabbi Herschel Leiner, Executive Director
