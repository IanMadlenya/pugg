        BEDELL-Jeffrey R., Ph.D. The Trustees, Faculty and Staff of Mount Sinai School of Medicine deeply mourn the passing of our esteemed colleague, Jeffrey R. Bedell, an Associate Professor of Psychiatry at Mount Sinai and Director of the Community Options Program at Elmhurst Hospital Center. A distinguished researcher in community psychiatry and talented clinician and teacher, Dr. Bedell was associated with the faculty of Mount Sinai from 1995 to 1999 and was respected by his colleagues for his innovative approaches in congnitive, behavioral and rehabilitative therapies with the severely mentally ill. He will be remembered fondly and sorely missed. We extend our sincere condolences to his wife, Lynn. Helene L. Kaplan, Chair, Mount Sinai School of Medicine Arthur H.
