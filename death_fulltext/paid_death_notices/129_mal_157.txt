        GERBER-Michael A. The Department of Pathology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine grieves deeply for Dr. Michael A. Gerber and his wife, Minda, who died on Sunday in an automobile accident. Dr. Gerber was a loyal alumnus and devoted friend of this department. He was an internationally renowned liver pathologist, scholar and researcher. He will be deeply missed.
