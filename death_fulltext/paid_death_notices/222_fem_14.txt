        BERKMAN -- Judith Cossin. Beloved wife of Charles; devoted mother and mother-inlaw to Meredith Berkman and Daniel Mintz, Marna (Berkman) Tolchin and Robert Tolchin, Johanna Berkman and Emanuel Weintraub; incomparable grandmother (''JuJu the legend'') to Morielle, Noa, Caleb, Amalya, Moses, Avital and Ezri; and loving sister and sister-inlaw to Adele (Cossin) Sobel and Herb Sobel. A retired psychiatric social worker, she brought her sensitivity and insights into human nature to the management of her husband's law practice. She was also a talented amateur actress with a flair for comedy. We already miss your childlike spirit, your generosity, strength, warmth, humor and wisdom. Hey, Jude, you gave us so much joy, love and laughter. Funeral July 4, 11 AM, Parkside Memorial Chapel, Brooklyn.
        BERKMAN--Judith. Always a joy, we will miss you. Our love and condolences to the Berkman family. The Mintz, Birdsall and Levine Families
