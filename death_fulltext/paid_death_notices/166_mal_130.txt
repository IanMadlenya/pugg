        BROCKBANK-Robert T. All of us are greatly saddened by Bob's passing and extend our deepest sympathies to the entire Brockbank family. He was a distinguished colleague and a dear friend of many of us for many years, and a significant force in the successes of Manufacturers Havover Trust, Chemical Bank, Chase Manhattan Bank and most recently, AXA Financial and AXA Group. Throughout his career, Bob was a great coach and mentor for those who worked for him and a giving teacher and advisor to those who worked with him. We will miss him very much.
