        POLLER-Rabbi H. Leonard. Larchmont Temple-Har Chayim records with deep sorrow the death of our beloved Rabbi Emeritus, H. Leonard Poller. Rabbi Poller served as the Senior Rabbi of Larchmont Temple-Har Chayim from 1972 to 1994. Rabbi Poller was ordained at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion (HUC-JIR) on May 25, 1957. He was the Chairman of the Task Force for the Creation of the New Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR) Prayerbook for the 21st Century, and was the CoEditor of On the Doorposts of Your House, a CCAR prayerbook. Rabbi Poller was a critic of religious affairs for CBS-TV ''Would You Believe'' from 1967 to 1972. In 1982 Rabbi Poller was awarded a Doctorate of Divinity Honoris Causa from HUC-JIR. In 1990 he received the Distinguished Service Award from the Synagogue Council of America. We will miss his warmth and compassion, his spiritual leadership, his scholarly efforts, and the rich contributions he made to the lives of all of his congregants. To his family and loved ones, we express our profound sympathy. Kenneth Gordon, President Jeffrey J. Sirkman, Rabbi
