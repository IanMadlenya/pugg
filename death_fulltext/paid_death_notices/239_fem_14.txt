        COE--Margaret Shaw ''Peg''. Planting Fields Foundation deeply regrets the loss of Peg Coe, 88, who died at her home in Cody, WY on November 15, 2006. A great supporter of Planting Fields Arboretum State Historic Park in Oyster Bay, NY, the former country estate of her in-laws, she worked to raise funds for the restoration of artist Robert Chanler's 1922 Buffalo Murals. Born in Cody on Christmas Day, 1917, Peg was ''born under a lucky star''. In 1943, she married Henry H.R. Coe, son of philanthropist William Robertson Coe and Standard Oil heiress Mai Rogers Coe. Peg and Henry were strong supporters of the Buffalo Bill Historical Center (BBHC) in Wyoming. With rich collections of Native American artifacts and Western art, the BBHC is known as the ''Smithsonian of the West''. During Peg's tenure as Chairman of the Board of Trustees, the BBHC doubled in size and achieved world-class status. Peg was preceded in death by her husband, Henry H.R. Coe; her parents, Ernest and Effie Shaw; brothers, Charles and Dick Shaw; stepdaughter Natalie Gerdes; and nephew, Geoffrey Shaw. Peg is survived by sister Ruth Shaw and sister - in - law Phyllis Shaw. Her children are Anne Hayes; Henry H.R. ''Hank'' Coe; Robert D. Coe II and stepdaughter Dorothy Boyd. Surviving grandchildren are Jay Hayes; Margaret ''Meg'' Hayes; H.R. Coe; Carey Johnson; Bethany Boydston; and Robert and Hubbard Coe. Surviving nieces and nephews are Ernie, Greg, Bob, and Mike Shaw; Anne Moran; Katy Kern-Levine; Dick, Alan, and Lee Kern; Dr. Michael Coe; Dr. William Coe. Interment at Riverside Cemetery followed services at Christ Episcopal Church in Cody on November 20, 2006. Memorial donations may be made to Planting Fields Foundation (P.O. Box 660, Oyster Bay, NY 11771), the BBHC (720 Sheridan Ave, Cody, WY 82414) or a charity of choice.
