She is survived by her brother, Walter Taussig, and his wife, Lore, of New York, and by her niece, Lynn Taussig, of San Francisco. All who knew her agree that she was-in addition to her scientific excellence-an outstanding and extraordinary person with fabulous charm; she will always be remembered with greatest love.
