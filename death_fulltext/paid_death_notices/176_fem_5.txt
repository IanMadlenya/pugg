        BARBOUR-Frederica P. The Trustees, administration, faculty, staff, students and alumni of Bank Street College of Education mourn the passing of Frederica P. Barbour. Freddie, as she was fondly known, joined The Bank Street Board in 1958, serving as its Chair from 1975 to 1979. Her spirited guidance helped Bank Street to fulfill important goals of meeting the broader needs of children in a range of settings in and out of schools. She played a central role in Bank Street's move to Morningside Heights in 1970, allowing the institution the space sorely needed to meet the needs of young children and society. Upon the end of her term in 1979, Ms. Barbour was elected to serve as a Life Trustee, the Board's highest honor. We are extremely fortunate to have benefited from her leadership, counsel and friendship over the past four decades. The entire Bank Street Community joins together in offering condolences to Mrs. Barbour's sons, grandchildren and great grandchildren. Augusta Souza Kappner, President Elizabeth S. Pforzheimer, Chair, Board of Trustees
