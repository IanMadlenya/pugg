        RUZICKA--Marla. The Open Society Institute mourns the loss of human rights activist and friend Marla Ruzicka, who was killed by a car bomb in Baghdad on Saturday. She lost her life while working to arrange medical care and compensation for the civilian victims of the war in Iraq. The Open Society Institute, a private foundation created and chaired by George Soros, is one of a host of organizations and people hard hit by her loss. We are proud to have supported Marla's work and are confident that she made a huge difference in the lives of so many people devastated by the war. We will miss her greatly.
