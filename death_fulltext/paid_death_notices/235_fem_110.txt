        ILCHMAN--Alice Stone. The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center mourns the loss of its esteemed Vice Chairman, Alice Stone Ilchman. Her leadership since joining the Board in 1998 was notable for its insight and energy. A moving force behind the establishment of the Frank E. Taplin, Jr. Commissioning Fund, Alice was an active and deeply involved Director with a passionate commitment to chamber music. She was unfailingly kind, thoughtful and constructive, and we will miss her indomitable spirit and her keen intelligence, grace and good humor. On behalf of our entire Board of Directors and staff, we extend our heartfelt sympathy to her husband, Warren, their daughter, Sarah, and their son, Frederick.

        $(6$)ILCHMAN--Alice Stone. The Advisory Board, Fellows, staff and colleagues of the Jeannette K. Watson Fellowship are saddened by the death of the program's founding director Alice Stone Ilchman on August 11, 2006. With optimism, wisdom and enthusiasm, Alice led the program into its seventh year of providing internships, mentoring, and guidance to college students in New York City. The program will continue to reflect the values and ideals that Alice cared deeply about--opportunity for young people, global awareness and commitment to the social good. Each of us will remember and keep with us Alice's generous spirit, her sheer good will and the pleasure she took in acts of ordinary kindness. Her vision, leadership and friendship will be missed. We extend our deepest condolences to her family, husband Warren, son Frederick, daughter Sarah and son-in-law Jacob.
