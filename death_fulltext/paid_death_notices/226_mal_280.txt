Seymour served in the US Army from 1943 through 1946 as an X-ray technician.

His career spanned 30 years. Seymour retired at 55 to Boynton Beach, FL where he was an avid tennis and golf player. His sense of humor, warmth, intelligence and kindness will be dearly missed by all who knew him. Seymour is survived by his beloved daughter, Linda, devoted sister, Ethel Sanders, and nephew, Alan Pecar, and loving and caring companion of 14 years, Suzy Saltzman. Also survived by cousins, nieces and nephews and his precious ''Belle.'' Memorial service Sunday, November 27, 3:30 PM, 11242 Westland Circle, Boynton Beach, FL.
