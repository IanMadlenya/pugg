        STOLL-John B., DDS. It is with sadness that the Medical Board of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center notes the passing of their long-time friend and colleague Dr. John B. Stoll. Dr. Stoll joined the staff of Memorial Hospital for Cancer and Allied Diseases in 1970 and was an Emeritus staff member at the time of his death.
