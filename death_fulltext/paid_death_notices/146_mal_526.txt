His spirited, indefatigable, vibrant leadership is almost irreplaceable. No worthy cause remained unsupported. All in need of his help found him never wanting. His likes will not pass this way soon again. His life was totally devoted to working men and women, all those in need. He was the most decent, kindest and most considerate person in all of our lives.

        HOFFMAN-Sol. We grieve beyond words at the untimely passing of a consummate fighter for workers' rights, decency and a better way of life. A participant in the struggle for civil rights who marched in the early struggles of the '50's, Vice President of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union and its successor organization, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees. His ceaseless efforts on behalf of the most needy is an everlasting tribute to his indominable spirit. Joseph Fisher, Co-Manager Pennsylvania, Ohio and South Jersey Joint Board
