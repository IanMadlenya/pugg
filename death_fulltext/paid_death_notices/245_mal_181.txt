        METZ--Eugene L., 90, a lifelong educator, died in Augusta, Georgia on May 30, 2007. Born in New York City in 1917, son of Herman A. Metz and Alice van Ronk Metz, he attended The Choate School (class of 1936) and Yale University (class of 1941). Due to a childhood bout with Polio, he was unable to join the WWII efforts. In 1942, he became headmaster at the Graham Eckes School in Palm Beach, Florida. After the war, he moved to Boston, Massachusetts and taught English at the Thayer Academy. On a trip to South America he met his future wife, Gloria Eastman in Quito, Ecuador. In 1952, the Metz family moved to Strasbourg, France, where Mr. Metz became a student advisor at the College of Free Europe. Later, in Paris, he became one of the directors of the Free Europe Committee, an institution whose purpose was to promote the ideas of western democracy to students from behind the Iron Curtain and Africa. In 1966, the family moved back to Quito, Ecuador where Mr. Metz worked on restoring his wife's family 400-year-old ''Hacienda Cusin,'' now a wellknown hotel near Otavalo. After his wife's death, he became Director General of the Colegio Americano de Quito, until 1979 when he returned to the United States, first to Boston and then to West Palm Beach. Except for a brief return to Quito as interim Director of the Colegio Americano from 1988 to 1991, he resided in West Palm Beach until early 2007. Mr. Metz was a cultivated man and engaging raconteur. His fair-minded attitude and sense of humor endeared him to his many friends and students. He will be remembered fondly by everyone who knew him. He is survived by his children, Victoria, Philip and Daniela, Edward and Eugenia and grandchildren Nicholas, Caroline, Isabella and Alexandra as well as many other family members in the USA, Ecuador and Europe.
