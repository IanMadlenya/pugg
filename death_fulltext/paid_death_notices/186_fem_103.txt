        SCHER-Sylvia. The officers, Board of Directors and staff of UJA-Federation of New York are deeply saddened by the passing of Sylvia Scher, a cherished friend of UJAFederation. As former chair of our Women's Campaign in New Rochelle, Mrs. Scher expressed her deep commitment to Jewish and humanitarian causes. Her legacy lives on through her family's dedication to helping the most vulnerable in our community through their exceptional support of UJA-Federation and its beneficiary agencies. We extend our sincerest condolences to Sylvia's husband, Robert; to her daughter, Ellen, and son-inlaw, Moshe; to her two grandchildren, Avi and Ricky; and to the entire Scher family. Larry Zicklin, President Morris W. Offit, Chair of the Board John S. Ruskay, Exec VP & C.E.O.
