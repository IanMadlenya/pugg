        OTTEN-Louis. The Officers, Board of Directors and Staff of Green Chimneys Children's Services and Green Chimney's School mourn the loss of Judge Louis Otten, our loyal and devoted supporter for over fifty years. Judge Otten, along with his late wife, Margery Levy Otten, served as Board Members. He passed this dedication on to his surviving children, Lois Robbins, a Past Board Member, and Michael Otten, a current Member of The Board of Directors. His generosity and devotion to the children, and programs of Green Chimneys will remain his legacy as enduring inspiration to all of us. Our deepest sympathies are extended to his family. Warren Colbert, Chairman Jules Schwimmer, President Joseph Whalen, Executive Director
