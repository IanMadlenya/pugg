        WASSERMAN -- Susan. She was a caring lady, just as Vicki Kops Wimpfheimer and my mother, Ida Bakalar Gluck were...Hitler forced Susan to come here and she conquered speaking English without a trace of an accent; it was a source of quiet pride. Vicki was born here; my mother came over in steerage-and struggled with English taking lessons most of her adult life; she joined the Theatre Guild to hear excellent English...Sue had a ''postage stamp'' apartment with a ''very nice landlord'', Vicki had a splenddid Park Ave., apartment and my mother had a tennis court-gardens home in Lawrence, LI...Sue stayed single, Vicki had five children and my mother had four...They were Women of Valor. When I mentioned (over lunch this week) to a world distinguished Rabbi how much I appreciated his eulogy to my mother, his reply was ''it was real.''...Sue, Vicki and my mother were all active in their synagogues achieving leadership roles, and particaping in civic events...But most of all-they were hard-working, fun, emphatic and caring ladies...Please come to Sue's funeral service today at 10:15 at Plaza, Amsterdam at 91stand be caring enough to ''shlep'' with us to Sharon Cemetery...Sue, Vickie and my mother are surely together in Heaven. God bless this caring threesome. Dorothy Gluck Margolin
