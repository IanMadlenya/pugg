        CHERNOW-Israel. On April 3, 2001 at age 85. Nobody could have matched the love, dedication, and encouragement that he lavished so generously on Ruth, his remarkable wife of 56 years, his sons Bart and Ron, their wives Peggy and Valerie, and granddaughter Shandee. He breathed life into our dreams, provided an unfailing model of hard work and goodness, and inspired us daily by words and deeds. We mourn the passing of one of life's quiet heroes.
