        GOLDBERG-Rabbi Julius. It is with deep sorrow that we note the passing of our beloved Rabbi, friend and advisor. Our heartfelt condolences to his loving wife Bette, his children and grandchildren. The Plainview Jewish Center and the Plainview Jewish community are where they are today because of his devotion and dedication. To him, being Rabbi, Sr. Rabbi and Rabbi Emeritus was not a job, but an avocation. His memory and accomplishments will certainly stay with us all forever. Lois, Jerold, Ronald and Sallie Kaniuk
