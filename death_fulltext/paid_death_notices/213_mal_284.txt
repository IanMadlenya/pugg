        WINDHOLZ--Thomas B. 81, an owner of Windwood Gallery, died in New York on October 22, 10 days after playing his last tennis game. Born in Arad, Romania, he immigrated to the States via Hungary in 1956 and worked as a research scientist at Merck. A defiant survivor of Nazism and Stalinism, a man of unparalleled devotion and loyalty to his family, of wiry energy, sharp intellect, sly humor, and good cheer, he pursued life, liberty and happiness with optimism and zest. His spirit lives on. Surviving are his childhood sweetheart and wife of 56 years, Martha, his daughters, Maya and Veronica, and their families, Steven, Eli and Ethan Weinstein, and Eduard, Alisa and Andrew Doga.
