        SNYDER-Shiekie. The Executive Board, local presidents, staff and members of District Council 37 are deeply saddened by the sudden death of the longtime president of Local 2021 New York City OffTrack Betting Corporation Employees. The Shiekie was a great trade unionist who fought long and hard for his members for more than 20 years. He had been a DC 37 Vice Present and Executive Board member for over 15 years. He was the oldest active president of an AFSCME local in the country. Shiekie was also part of the special fabric that makes New York unique. He had great stories to tell, knew more jokes than anyone, could tap dance with the best of them and knew the lyrics to songs most of us had never heard of. We will miss his tireless leadership and winning spirit. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to his beloved wife Betty, daughters Sharon and Vicki, son Sandy and much loved grandchildren.
