        FETTERMAN-Max. The partners and associates of Loeb & Troper express our sincere condolences to our partner Allen Fetterman and his sister Judi Whilden upon the loss of their father. Max also left two brothers and four grandchildren. He was 85 years old and resided in Craig, CO. May the family be granted comfort and consolation with all of those who mourn for Zion and Jerusalem.
