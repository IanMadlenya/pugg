        BRODY--Barry, on March 13th, 2005 at 72 years old in Boynton Beach, FL. Beloved husband of 50 years of Feige. Loving father of Steven (Cindy) of Edison, NJ; Mark (Pamela) of Delmar, NY and Linda (Gary) Bakst of Slingerlands, NY. Devoted grandfather to Joshua, Samuel, Nicolette, Scott, Leah & Daniel. Barry is survived by his loving sisters Diane Gareen and Clair Brody as well as a large circle of extended family and friends. An educator and administrator in the NYC public school system for over 30 years, Barry was a lifelong learner. A voracious reader and avid tennis, paddleball and pinochle player. Barry lived his life with integrity. He had no tolerance for lying or taking the easy way out. He often referred to people he liked as a ''straight arrow'', meaning you could count on their word--and that was certainly true of Barry. We will miss his strength and insight. Funeral services Tuesday, March 15th, Louis Suburban Chapel, Fairlawn, NJ.
