        STRAUSS--Benjamin M. The Shaare Zedek family mourns with great sadness the untimely death of a modest, sweet and loving husband, son, father, brother and uncle. As a Founder of the Medical Center, together with his beloved wife Claire, we will always cherish their support of our Outpatient Clinic Garden and the expansion of our synagogue. Benjamin grew up in a home immersed in love and devotion to the hospital. His father, Norbert, served with distinction and supreme dedication as Treasurer of the American Committee for thirty-two years and, together with his wife Trude, is a Diamond Founder of the hospital. May the warm memories of the time spent together bring some measure of solace to Claire, Norbert, Trude, children Josh, Avi, Timi, and Ellie, sister Esther Perl, mother-in-law Lucy Lang, Golden Founder, and the entire family. May they be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. American Committee for Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem Erica Jesselson, Chair Menno Ratzker, Pres.
