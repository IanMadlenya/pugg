        MEIBACH-Aaron. The Board of Directors, residents and staff of The Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale mourn with sorrow the death of Aaron Meibach, for more than 23 years, a dedicated, compassionate volunteer who gave generously of his time and energies in support of the residents and the work of The Hebrew Home. As recent tenants of River House West, Aaron and his late, dear wife Freda widened even further their circle of friendships here. Our deepest sympathies go to Aaron's beloved daughters Ina Meibach, Judy Meibach and Doris Wallace. He will be missed, and his memory cherished by all. Milton A. Gilbert, President Bernard Goldberg, Chairman Daniel Reingold, Exec. V.P.
