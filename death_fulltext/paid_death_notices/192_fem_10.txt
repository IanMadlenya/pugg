        BERTELSMANN - Elizabeth C. The administration, trustees, and alumni/ae of Bard College deeply mourn the passing of long-time friend and colleague Elizabeth Bertelsmann, who for more than 35 years was a beloved and respected member of the Bard community. A photographer, author, teacher, and generous supporter of the College, Lilo, along with her late husband, Heinz, demonstrated a profound commitment to education and community responsibility to generations of Bardians. She made a deep and lasting impact on all who knew her and will be sorely missed. We extend our deepest condolences to her family. By the request of her family, there will be no memorial service. A memorial concert dedicated to the Bertelsmanns will be held at Bard College at a date to be announced. Leon Botstein, President David E. Schwab II, Chairman
