He left Newsweek to form his own publishing consulting firm and subsequently started Family Media, Inc., a magazine publishing company that, at its peak, published 12 consumer titles including Ladies' Home Journal, Savvy, World Tennis, Discover, and 1,001 Home Ideas. An avid runner, Mr. Riordan ran five marathons during his lifetime with his first in 1981 at the age of 51. His personal best in the New York Marathon was a finish time of 2:57:56. He will be missed and will be remembered as a man with huge ideas and a huge heart.
