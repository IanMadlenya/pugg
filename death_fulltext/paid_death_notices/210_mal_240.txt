        POBINER--Dr. Jeffrey. The faculty and residents of the Division of Endodontics at Stony Brook University record with deep sorrow the passing of their faculty member, Dr. Jeffrey Pobiner. Jeff's involvement, support, and ability to pass onto others his vast knowledge of endodontics was limitless. He was kind, thoughtful of others, and found only goodness in all of his students, patients, and friends. We express our deepest sympathy to his wife Joanne, his children Shawn, Todd, Dana, and the entire family. We love you Jeff and will miss you dearly. Dr. Seymour Friedman Director of Endodontics
