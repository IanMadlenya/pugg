        SIMON-Sidney. We deeply mourn the loss of our beloved friend whose inspired artistry contributed so much to the dignity and beauty of the Jewish Chapel at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York. Visitors are tremendously impressed with his creation of the tablets and the ark doors and curtain. His memory will live on in his magnificent work. Herbert M. Ames, Chairman Louis Gross, President West Point Jewish Chapel Fund
        SIMON-Sidney. The members of the American Academy of Arts and Letters note with sorrow the death of their esteemed colleague whose passing will be mourned by the world of art.
