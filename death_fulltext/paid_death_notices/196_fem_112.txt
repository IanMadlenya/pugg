        CROUTER-Agathe (nee Keliher). The Packer Collegiate Institute Board of Trustees, Alumni Board, faculty and staff mourn the loss of our long-time friend and esteemed alumna. A former Trustee and member of the class of 1954, Mrs. Crouter served as a tireless advocate for Packer. She made deep and lasting contributions to the school that will stand as a testament to her personal integrity and insistence upon academic excellence and moral standards. We shall miss our partner and caring friend. Cynthia Elliott Chair, Board of Trustees J. Geoffrey Pierson Head of School
