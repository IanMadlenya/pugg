        MARKWITZ -- Adele. Her talent, skill, dedication and boundless love over more than twenty-five years gave our children the world of speech and the gift of self confidence. She did the same for countless others. She became a member of our family, our guardian angel, and is forever in the words we exchange and in our hearts. The Haimowitz and Swiller Families >>AD#
