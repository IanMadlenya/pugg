        HERMAN--Amy. 53, on July 2. Beloved daughter of Sylvia, sister of Marc, sister-in-law of Harriet, aunt, friend and colleague of many.

In lieu of flowers, please make donations to NY AIDS Coalition-Amy Herman Fund, 231 W. 29 St., Suite 1002, NY NY 10001 or to any cancer research organization.
