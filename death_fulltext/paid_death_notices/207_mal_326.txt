        COHEN--Albert, M.D. With sorrow we note the passing of a compassionate and wise man, who was the dearest husband of Frederika; brother of Sidelle Scott and brother-in-law of Brenda and David Murrell. He was a physician who dedicated himself to his patients, many times making home visits to accommodate their special needs. He affiliated with St. Luke's/Roosevelt Hospital, and was a police surgeon with the New York City Police Department. He passed on Tuesday the 27th of April after a long illness.
