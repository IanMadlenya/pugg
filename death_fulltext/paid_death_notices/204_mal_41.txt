        LAUFER--John P. It is with sadness that the Associated Builders and Owners of Greater New York mourn the passing of our great member, John Laufer, ABO's 2000 Associate of the Year. As we start this New Year, we will all feel the void from John's loss. He was truly a gentleman and an all around great guy. Rest in peace John...stay out of mischief. Jerome Belson, President Michael Kerr, Co-Chairman Arnold Sollar, Co-Chairman Nicholas LaPorte, Jr., Executive Director
