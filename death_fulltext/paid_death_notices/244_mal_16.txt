        SIEGAL--Abraham, on April 30th, 2007, in his 81st year. My darling husband Abe Siegal passed away suddenly yesterday. He is survived by his son Scott Siegal, daughter-inlaw Carolyn and grandchildren Daniel and Blair of Altadena, California, and daughter Lisa of New York City. Papa Abe is also survived by his extended family Adam, Susan, Andrew, Max and Jordan Sahn of New City, NY, Jonathan, Kathy, Samantha, and Erin Sahn of Boca Raton, Florida, and Eric, Amy, Zach and Lucas of Redwood City, CA. Abe will be remembered by his friends and family as a man who lived life to the fullest. Whether it was zip gliding with his grandkids to celebrating his 75th birthday, traveling the world with me, or dancing the night away, he did everything with gusto and a smile on his face. He was a dedicated businessman who started with nothing and built a successful electronics sales company. Abe was a friend to everyone; he would kibbitz with everyone he met from the server in a restaurant, a taxi driver, and the unsuspecting Chinese food delivery man. His family will especially remember the love he showed them and the wonderful example he set by seemingly enjoying every moment of every day. He embraced his extended family as if they were his own and cherished the time he spent with all of us. I will miss him. Funeral services will take place Thursday, May 3rd, at 11:45 at ''The Riverside'', Amsterdam Ave. and 16th St. In lieu of flowers, please make donations in Abe's memory to: UJA Federation of NY, 130 E 59th St., NY 10022. Love, Dorothy Siegal
