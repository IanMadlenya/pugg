        BLANKS-Lloyd Walton, 80. January 3, 1922-June 21, 2002. A college administrator and artist, his works in wool have been exhibited in museums and galleries in the United States and throughout the world. Survived by sisters Meldean and Verlyn (Grady Trantham) and devoted nieces and nephews. His ashes will be scattered in the Caps, Texas Cemetery. Rumor has it that when Caps was founded, Lloyd's grandfather threw his cap into the air, thus naming the town. Lloyd Blanks was loved by all who knew him.
