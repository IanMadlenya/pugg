        AMMON-R. Theodore. The Board of Trustees and members of the faculty and staff at Bucknell University are deeply saddened by the death of our trustee, R. Theodore Ammon. Ted, who graduated from Bucknell in 1971, was a loyal alumnus who gave the largest single gift in the university's history to establish a scholarship for students, and also issued a challenge to other donors that resulted in more than $52 Million in new gifts for endowed scholarships. It was his hope that ''the gifts will not be measured in dollars and cents... but will instead be measured by the value created for future Bucknell students.'' His kindness and concern for others was a mark of his character. We extend our sincerest sympathy to his family and friends. D. Lee Hamilton, Chairman Steffen H. Rogers, President
