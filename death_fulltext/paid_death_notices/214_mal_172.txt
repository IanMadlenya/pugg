        KANE--Jasper H. The Board of Trustees, administration, faculty, students and alumni of Polytechnic University mourn the passing of Dr. Jasper H. Kane, alumnus, generous benefactor and 1995 Honorary Doctorate of Science recipient of the University. Dr. Kane's vision and enormous contributions to the field of chemical science are legendary. A retired vice president and director of Pfizer Inc, he headed the research team that discovered terramycin and also helped develop the process of mass producing penicillin, streptomycin and other antibiotics during World War II. His gentle humor and generous spirit will be very much missed. We extend heartfelt condolences to all members of the bereaved family. Stewart G. Nagler, Chairman David C. Chang, President Polytechnic University
