        STEIN-Alice C. Died peacefully June 20th, 2001, following a long period of diminished health. She is fondly remembered as the proprietor of Gordon's Book Store on 55th St in the St. Regis Hotel, a mecca for those interested in politics and the arts, as well as for automobile, train and history buffs from all over the world. The shop's closing in October of 1988 left a void in many lives. Her postretirement career as a volunteer, at the School of American Ballet and at Channel 13, reflected a lifelong devotion to this City and especially to the New York City Ballet, which she had followed since its first performances. Her warmth and wit will be deeply missed. Donations in her memory may be made to the School of American Ballet.
