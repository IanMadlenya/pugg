        AIKEN--David. Beloved cousin, intrepid traveler and insouciant spirit, adventerous cook and dapper dresser, witty and wry; New Yorker by birth, California desert dweller by choice. David treasured the many generations of his Gallatin family. We will always remember and miss you, dear David. A memorial wil be held in Stonington, CT, this spring.
