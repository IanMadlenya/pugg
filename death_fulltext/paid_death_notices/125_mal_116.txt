        LANDES-Morris. State of Israel Bonds and its Rabbinic Cabinet mourn the passing of a distinguished leader of the American Rabbinate. Morris Landes of blessed memory was an inspiration not only to the Pittsburgh community but to all of American Jewry. An intrepid Zionist, he was by word and deed a model of devotion to G-d and humanity. Our prayers of condolence go out to his beloved wife Naomi, their children, and grandchildren. We include as well his loving brothers Leon Landes and Rabbi Aaron Landes, the esteemed chairman of our Cabinet.
