        BOWEN-Louis W. The Board of Managers and staff of East Side House Settlement are profoundly saddened by the passing of Louis W. Bowen. A dear friend and devoted benefactor, he joined the Board of Managers in 1968 and provided dynamic and tireless leadership of the Winter Show Committee for over 30 years. He also held leadership positions on the Executive, Finance and Nominating Committees. Mr. Bowen was an integral part of the heart and soul of East Side House-his professionalism, dedication, unfailing courtesy and especially his friendship will long be remembered. Joan P. Young, President David L. Duffy, Chairman East Side House Board of Managers John A. Sanchez, Executive Director East Side House Settlement
