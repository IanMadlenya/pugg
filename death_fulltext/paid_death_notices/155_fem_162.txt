Rosenhirsch Library in the Rodeph Sholom Day School and the Rosenhirsch Music Endowment Fund are among their many legacies. Our deepest condolences are extended to Blanche's family. We all are diminished by her death. May she rest in peace. Robert N. Levine, Senior Rabbi Mark Biderman, President The Board of Trustees of Congregation Rodeph Sholom
