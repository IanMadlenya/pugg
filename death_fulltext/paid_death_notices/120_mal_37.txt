        BROWN - Stanley. Age 42, on January 3, 1997. A quintessential New Yorker, he loved this city, its people, and most of all their differences. He was a champion of the everyman. It was impossible to be around him and not be moved by his rhythm for life. Our sympathy to his family and to his companion, Rodolfo (Rodgee) Coo.  Your Friends
