        BEAUMONT-Philip. All of us at Chadbourne & Parke LLP mourn the death of our friend and colleague, Philip Beaumont, on July 3, 1999. Phil first joined our firm from Columbia Law School in 1973 and by 1980 had become a partner specializing in mergers and acquisitions. But aside from being a first-class corporate lawyer, he was so much more: a wonderful mentor to our young associates; a man who handled the most complicated corporate transactions with cool elan; and, most importantly, a loving and caring father to three wonderful daughters. Our hearts go out to them and his wife, Meaghan McGrath Beaumont. Phil, you have left the world far too young-your legacy, however, will live long into the next century.
