        FISCHER -- Henry George. The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn the loss of Dr. Henry Fischer, a world-renowned curator and scholar of ancient Egyptian art, whose vast contributions to his field have had a lasting impact on the present-day understanding of pharaonic culture. During a 34-year career at the Metropolitan, he headed the Egyptian art department (1964-70) and was crucially involved in the efforts to bring the Temple of Dendur to the museum in 1967. In 1970 museum patron Lila Acheson Wallace endowed a special curatorship in Egyptology to enable him to focus on his research, and he retired as curator emeritus in 1992. His formidable contributions will be respected and studied for many years to come, by colleagues and students at the Metropolitan and around the world. James R. Houghton, Chairman Philippe de Montebello, Director Emily K. Rafferty, President Dorothea Arnold, Lila Acheson Wallace Chairman of Egyptian Art
