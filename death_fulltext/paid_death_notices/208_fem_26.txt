        LUBKIN--Virginia, M.D. The Board of Directors and Medical Staff of The New York Eye and Ear Infirmary profoundly mourn the death of an esteemed colleague. Attending surgeon in the Department of Ophthalmology since 1945, Dr. Lubkin was a pioneer in the field; a gifted clinician, teacher and researcher; and founder and director of the Infirmary's Aborn Center for Eye Research. She was an inspiration to all. We extend our deepest sympathies to her entire family. Peter Frelinghuysen, Chairman of the Board Joseph B. Walsh, M.D., Chairman, Dept. of Ophthalmology Joseph P. Corcoran, President and CEO
