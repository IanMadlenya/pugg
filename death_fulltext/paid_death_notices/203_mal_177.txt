        SHAW--Joseph. The entire Yeshiva University and its affiliate Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary family mourn the passing of a deeply cherished friend and supporter, a highly respected Jewish communal leader, who with his wife, Sylvia, endowed scholarships at Yeshiva College and the Kollel Elyon of RIETS. His humility, generosity, vision and concern for the future of Torah U'madda from which his own family benefitted was inspiring. Heartfelt condolences are extended to Sylvia, their children: Barry (and Phyllis) Shaw, Simon (and Janet) Shaw, their six grandchildren and fourteen great-grandchildren. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Richard M. Joel, President Dr. Norman Lamm Chancellor Ronald P. Stanton, Chairman YU Board of Trustees Julius Berman, Chairman RIETS Board of Trustees Joshua L. Muss, Chairman YC Board of Directors
