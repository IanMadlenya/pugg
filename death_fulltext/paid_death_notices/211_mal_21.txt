        GOLDSTEIN -- Rabbi Leon ard. It is with profound sorrow that we mark the passing of a truly wonderful, kind, giving and learned man, a great Jewish leader, Rabbi Leonard Goldstein. Leonard and his late wife Helen Fried Kirshblum Goldstein have served with distinction as members of our Executive Committee, Founders Society, and other committees, where we benefited from Leonard's wise counsel and leadership. He was a role model for Jewish commitment. Our prayers are with the Goldstein, Fried and Dayan families on this painful loss, which we share. May his memory be a blessing for all.
