        ROSENBERG--Marcus, 81, on February 18, 2005 in Dallas, TX. Philanthropist and industrialist with a keen analytical mind. A man of vision who established Arrow Industries and many Jewish institutions. Nothing ever stood in his way. Dearly loved and missed by his wife, Ann (nee Pappenheim); children Helen, Steven, Lizzy, Sheri, and spouses; grandchildren Eli, David, Jessica, Daniel, Ariela, Samuel, Dana, Gabriella, Miles, Noa, Jake and Mina. Survived by his siblings, Manny Rohan, David Rosenberg and Erica Sigel. Preceded in death by his daughter, Margot Pulitzer.
        ROSENBERG--Marcus. The Yeshiva University/RIETS family is deeply grieved by the passing in Dallas, Texas, of one of the nation's outstanding philanthropists and leaders of the Jewish community in Dallas and throughout the South. He was a warm, kind, and compassionate leader, whose concern for the well being of the Jewish people and the State of Israel is widely acknowledged. Together with his beloved wife, Ann, he was a Guardian of YU, having established the Marcus and Ann Rosenberg Scholarship Fund. He was a foremost proponent of Jewish education and other Jewish values which he and Ann inculcated into their entire family. Heartfelt condolences are extended to his beloved wife Ann; his children: Helen Rosenberg Waks, Steven (and Ruthy) Rosenberg, Lizzy (and Dr. Jules) Greif, Sheri Rosenberg, and Randy Pulitzer, widower of his lamented daughter, Margot Rosenberg, of blessed memory; to all his 12 grandchildren, and to siblings Emanuel Rohan, David Rosenberg, and Erica Sigal. May the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel, President Norman Lamm, Chancellor Morry J. Weiss, Chairman, YU Board of Trustees Julius Berman, Chairman, RIETS Board of Trustees
