        RITZ--Esther Leah. It is with deep sadness that we mark the passing of Esther Leah Ritz, Chair of Jewish Community Centers Association/ JWB from 1982 to 1986. Her high intelligence, honesty and passion for the JCC Movement and the Florence G. Heller Resource Center, and her profound concern for Israel and the Jewish people, made an impact on all who knew her. We have lost a devoted friend. Edward H. Kaplan, Chair Allan Finkelstein, President
