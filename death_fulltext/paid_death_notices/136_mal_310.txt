        LIEBOWITZ-Simon. We record with regret and sadness the death of Simon Liebowitz at age 92 on May 24, 1998. Prior to serving in the New York Senate and as Justice of the State Supreme Court, he had been our Union's first General Counsel and later was the impartial chairman of our Legal Benefits Program. He brought to his responsibilities those great qualities of heart and mind which meant and made great occasions. Our profound condolences to his wife, Elsie, and the other members of his family. District 1115, SEIU, Jay Sackman, General President Michael Sackman, Pres. Emeritus
