        LERNER-Sophie. The Young Israel of Great Neck expresses its deepest sorrow on the passing of Sophie Lerner, wife of our devoted member Ed, mother of our esteemed Rabbi Yaacov Lerner and Abby, mother of David and Esther, and grandmother of Shayna, Yehudit, Zahava, Yosefa, Shimon, Benyamin and Penina. We all feel a great sense of loss because Mrs. Lerner captured the hearts of our entire shul serving as everyone's ''Bubbi,'' and showering us with her boundless love and kisses.
