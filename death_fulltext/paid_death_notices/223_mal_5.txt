        Van AMBURG--Dr. James E. We, the Board, faculty and staff, and the entire community of the Dwight-Englewood School, mourn the loss of a visionary educator, outstanding educational leader, and friend. From 1984-1998, Jim's leadership, as the school's headmaster, enhanced the school's reputation and national recognition for its curricular innovations such as the award-winning Senior Focus Program and the Upper School integrated Math/Science/Technology (MST) curriculum. During his tenure, Jim oversaw the merger with the Bede School, resulting in a preschool-12th grade program. His committment to diversity at DwightEnglewood and to the school's support of the New Jersey SEEDS program has changed many lives and strengthened our community. We will miss him, but his legacy lives on.
        Van AMBURG--James. Convent of the Sacred Heart extends sympathy and prayers to the Van Amburg and Windward School families. A devoted trustee of Convent of the Sacred Heart, Jim was an educator ''par excellence,'' who always put children first. His values and principles will live forever in all who loved him and served with him. Convent of the Sacred Heart, Greenwich John N.
