        SARDI--Vincent The officers, board of directors and the staff of the Irish Repertory Theatre mourn the passing of our most excellent boardmember, Vincent Sardi, who we held in the highest regard. His grand good humor and great generosity was a thing of beauty and a joy every day of his life. Our thoughts are with his wife June and thier extended family.
