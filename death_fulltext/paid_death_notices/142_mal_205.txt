        MILLIKEN-Minot K. The Board of Trustees and the Women's Board of The Boys' Club of New York regret the loss of our esteemed colleague and friend, Minot Milliken. As an active Trustee for the past 50 years, Minot worked tirelessly to help improve the lives of inner city boys giving them an alternative to the city's mean streets. He served with distinction as President for 25 years providing the vision, the financial and human resources to help make The Boys' Club of New York a safe haven for many generations of disadvantaged boys. He was the motivating source and benefactor in the expansion of the Pitt Street Clubhouse. In his honor this newly built facility is appropriately renamed the Milliken Clubhouse. A wise counselor, a stalwart friend, an energetic worker, a leader, his impact on The Boys' Club of New York will live on. Minot Milliken made a difference. He will long be remembered.
