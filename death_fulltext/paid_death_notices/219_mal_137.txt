        HILLEMAN--Maurice, MD, one of the world's greatest public health heroes, developed more than 40 vaccines that prevented the death and suffering of millions. His remarkable legacy laid the scientific groundwork for our ongoing efforts to develop safe, effective vaccines for AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria--the 3 most deadly infectious diseases today. His work benefited all humanity, and we will especially miss his tireless leadership, his humor, and his devotion to the singular task of saving human lives. Dr. Jerald C.
