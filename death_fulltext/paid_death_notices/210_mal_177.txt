        LESMAN -- Howard. Who carved a successful career at one of New York's most creative advertising agencies, died on Thursday, in Amagansett, NY, of cancer. He was 48 years old. Mr. Lesman began his advertising career in Boston and moved to New York in the early 80's to join Ammirati & Puris where he worked until 2000, when he founded MatchWorks, an advertising consultancy. Mr. Lesman was known for his warmth, humor and legion of great friends. Mr. Lesman was the son of Shirley Lesman and the late Arthur Lesman of Buffalo, NY. He is survived by his beloved partner of 23 years Richard Levy, and his loving brother Bruce Lesman, as well as scores of devoted friends and family. Mr. Lesman will be buried at Boynton Beach, FL. A memorial service will be held in the fall in NYC. Donations to the Kerry for President Campaign or Esophageal Cancer Research at Memorial SloanKettering are requested in lieu of flowers because Howard would have wanted it that way.
