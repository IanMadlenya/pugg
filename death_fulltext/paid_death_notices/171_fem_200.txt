        WEITMAN-Jackie. The Be'er Hagolah Institute for Russian immigrants expresses its deep sorrow on the passing of Mrs. Jackie Weitman. Her rare beauty and extraordinary strength will long be remembered. She instilled in her children a feeling of responsibility toward helping others less fortunate. We will always treasure her concern for our immigrant children. We extend our deepest condolences to Doug and Ellen, Brian, Amy and Chloe, and Jason. Pearl Kaufman, Director
