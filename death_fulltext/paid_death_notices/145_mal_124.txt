        HUSSEIN-His Majesty, King of Jordan. The American Society for Technion-Israel Institute of Technology (ATS) joins with all advocates of peace, progress and regional cooperation in the Middle East in expressing great sorrow at the passing of King Hussein. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his family and his people. He touched our lives memorably, with his gracious reception in the summer of 1995 of our mission to Jordan. His passion for peace has served as a guiding light in negotiations on regional water issues between Technion and Jordanian experts. May his wisdom, vision and statesmanship serve as continuing models for the region and the world. American Society for Technion-Israel Institute of Technology Lawrence S. Jackier, National President Irving A. Shepard, Chairman, Board of Directors Melvyn H. Bloom, Executive Vice President
