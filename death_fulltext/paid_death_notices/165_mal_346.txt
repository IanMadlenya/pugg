        BERRY-Walter. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of beloved artist and friend, Walter Berry. He made his Met debut in 1966 as an unforgettable Barak in the company premiere of Strauss' ''Die Frau ohne Schatten,'' and was subsequently heard at the Met in nine other roles, including three new productions: Don Pizarro in ''Fidelio,'' Telramund in ''Lohengrin,'' and Baron Ochs in ''Der Rosenkavalier.'' All of his portrayals were imbued with deep artistry and intelligence and an uncommon beauty of voice. We extend our deepest sympathies to his family.
