        GROSSMAN-Harold. On April 10, 1998. Loving husband of Gloria, beloved father of Sandy, caring grandfather of Rikki and Ross and dear brother of Ralph. It can be said that Harold Grossman had an active, productive life with its share of satisfying moments, mostly because he had the opportunity at the Allentown Jewish Community Center and on the basketball court to tell so many youngsters that living according to the rules is the best way and they would benefit from it. This they did because of Harold. May he rest in peace.
