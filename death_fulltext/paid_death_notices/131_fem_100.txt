        WEISENFELD - Mildred. The Mount Sinai Medical Center Department of Ophthalmology mourns the passing of Mildred Weisenfeld, whose dedication supporting research in the understanding and treatment of disorders of the eye made possible many advances in our ability to better the lives of our patients. Her cherished Fight for Sight and its affiliates provided invaluable support and encouragement of our department's research, and her initiative led to the establishment of our Helmsley/Fight for Sight Children's Eye Clinic, greatly enhancing our children's eye care program. We offer sincerest condolences to her family. She will be very much missed. Steven M. Podos, M.D. Chairman, Department of Ophthalmology Edward L. Raab, M.D. Director, Children's Eye Clinic
