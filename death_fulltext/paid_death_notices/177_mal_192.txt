        ROSENBLOOM-Benjamin. Hillel: Foundation for Jewish Campus Life extends its deepest condolences to the Rosenbloom family on the passing of our beloved friend and benefactor, Benjamin Rosenbloom. Ben was committed to passing on the light of Jewish living to the next generation, an objective he accomplished magnificently through his children and grandchildren, and through his commitment to Hillel. He is survived by his wife Esther, his sister Mildred Hecht, his children Howard and Harriet, and his grandchildren Cynthia, Keith, Sandy and Robert. May his menschlichkeit always be a source of inspiration. Edgar M. Bronfman, Chairman Lynn Schusterman, Co-Chair Michael Steinhardt, Co-Chair Richard M. Joel, President
