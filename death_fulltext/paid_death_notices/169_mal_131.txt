        DAVIS-Leonard. The arts have lost a dear friend and an extraordinary gentleman. Leonard Davis was one of the original members of the Kravis Center's Board of Directors. He, along with his beloved wife Sophie, who predeceased him four months ago, shared their love of the arts in guiding the Center in its growth as a world class performing arts center. His direction, guidance and pure humanity will be profoundly missed, but his impact on the cultural landscape will be felt for generations to come. Our heartfelt condolences to Alan, Michael and their families. Alexander W. Dreyfoos, Jr. Board Chairman Judith A. Mitchell Chief Executive Officer Kravis Center for the Performing Arts
