        KRIEGER-Zanvyl. We mourn the loss of a true giant in the world of Jewish and general philanthropy. As a Diamond Founder of the Medical Center, his outstretched hand of kindness made an invaluable contribution to our Department of Ophthalmology and to many thousands of people in Jerusalem. Our sincerest condolences to his daughters, Betsy Kandel-Krieger and Jeanne Krieger Kahn and the entire family. May they be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Amer.
