        DARION-Joe. Joe Darion and I created the score for ''Man of La Mancha.'' We became parents of a classic. We shared many things, including a birthday (January 30th). I am forever grateful that he shared his creative life with me and I will remember him forever. Rest in peace, Joe. Mitch Leigh
