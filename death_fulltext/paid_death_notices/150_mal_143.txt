        WISE-Aaron, Rabbi. We record with sorrow the passing of our beloved colleague. He was founding rabbi of Congregation Adat Ariel in Los Angeles in 1947 until his retirement in 1978 when he became rabbi emeritus. He was founder of Making Marriage Work at the University of Judaism. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife Miriam, children Tamar and Yitzhak, and to all who were touched through his rabbinate. Rabbi Seymour L. Essrog, President Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Exec VP The Rabbinical Assembly
