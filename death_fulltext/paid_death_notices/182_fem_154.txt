        SIMPSON-Eleanor A. Long Island University mourns the loss of university trustee and friend, Eleanor A. Simpson. With extraordinary insight, judgement and grace, she served on the Academic Affairs and University Relations committees, the C.W. Post Campus Council of Overseers, and Tilles Center Council of Overseers. Her devotion to our students and service to the university community will not be forgotten.
