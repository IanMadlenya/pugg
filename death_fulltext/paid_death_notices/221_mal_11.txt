        BEN-HAIM--Rabbi Baruch. ''If not for the Torah, the heavens and earth would not have existed.'' Our Rabbis teach us that the continuous study of Torah sustains the entire world. The Magen David Yeshivah family mourns the passing of our deeply loved and highly respected Rabbi Baruch Ben-Haim. He was the guiding force of our community for over 50 years, and left an indelible mark on the future generations of our Sephardic Community. His legacy will live on through the many lives he touched with his goodness, wisdom and compassion. He will be missed, but never forgotten. We extend our deepest sympathy to his dear wife Charlotte, his children Eli, Yaakov, Yehuda, David, his grandchildren and his entire family. Our prayers are with them at this most difficult time. Eddie J. Esses, President and the entire Magen David Yeshivah family
        BEN - HAIM -- Baruch, Chief Rabbi. It is with deep sorrow and a broken heart that we mourn the passing of our beloved Chief Rabbi, Hacham Baruch Ben-Haim. Rabbi Baruch served the Sephardic Community for over 50 years with devotion, love and self sacrifice. His guidance inspired many to emulate him by pursuing their Talmudic and Rabbinic studies. His humility and modesty served as a beacon of light to Rabbis and laymen alike. He will never be forgotten for bringing our community to the lofty heights being enjoyed today. On behalf of the Shaare Zion Congregation and its Executive Committee we want to extend our condolences to his dear wife, his esteemed sons, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. The entire community has suffered an irreplaceable loss with his passing. May his soul dwell in the highest part of the heavens. Amen.
