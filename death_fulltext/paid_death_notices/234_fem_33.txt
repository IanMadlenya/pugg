        LIEBERSON--Lorraine Hunt. New York City Opera deeply mourns the passing of this extraordinary colleague and friend, whose humanity was as radiant as her unforgettable singing. She made her debut with our company in the title role of Xerxes in 1997, in performances that were immediately recognized as a landmark in City Opera history. Her return as Sesto in ''La clemenza di Tito'' in 2000 was no less memorable. Her warm collegiality and her passionate commitment to musical excellence, dramatic intensity and spritual truth were an inspiration to all of us. She was one of the great artists of her generation. We extend our deepest sympathies to her husband Peter Lieberson, her family, and her many friends and colleagues throughout the world. She will be profoundly missed.Paul Kellogg, General Director
