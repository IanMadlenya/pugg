        BLOOMSTEIN-Charles. On October 28, 2002. The Board and staff of the Mertz Gilmore Foundation note with sadness the death of their longtime colleague, mentor, and friend. From the Foundation's beginning, Charlie served as its conscience and provider of wise counsel. He believed passionately that one could make a difference by supporting the ideas and work of non-profit groups. He was a close friend and colleague of Bayard Rustin, civil rights activist and organizer of the 1963 March on Washington, and of Robert W. Gilmore, longtime activist and Quaker. An avid wordsmith, Charlie followed the Mark Twain axiom that: ''The difference between the right word and the almost right word is the difference between lightning and the lightning bug''. Charlie was our lightning. His devotion, advise, and sense of humor will be deeply missed.
