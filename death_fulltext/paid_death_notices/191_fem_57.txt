        STRONACH-Judith Lee. The Board of Trustees and the staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn the passing of a generous Benefactor, Judith Lee Stronach. Together with her husband, Raymond Lifchez, Ms. Stronach generously supported many areas of the Museum's work, including educational programs, a curatorial internship, the Thomas J. Watson Library, and the Greek and Roman Art Galleries. We extend our sympathies to Ray and the entire family. Philippe de Montebello Director
