        KASMIN-Allan. Age 73, of New York City, and Lake Ridge, CT, lost his courageous battle with lung cancer on June 15, 2002. Extremely devoted to his family and friends, who will miss him dearly. Highly respected lawyer, avid collector of clocks and antiques, history buff, world traveler, sharp dresser and role model. Survived by his family: wife and best friend Carole; children Franklin and Esther, Craig and Martine, and Jennifer and Simon; grandchildren Rebecca, Devorah and Noah; brother Leon; sisters-in-law Laura, Barbara, Barb and Marge; brother-in-law Stephen. His loss will leave an emptiness in all of our hearts; his love will leave us forever richer.
        KASMIN-Allan. Dad, you were the most independent, tough, loving, and sincere person we knew. We love you and miss you always. Franklin, Esther, Rebecca, and Devorah Kasmin
