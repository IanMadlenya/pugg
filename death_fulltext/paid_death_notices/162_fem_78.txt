        DAVIS-Mrs. Elvera, a/a ''Baby Sanchez''/d. New York Committee to Celebrate National Tap Dance Day mourns September 2 passing of its Advisory Committee member. Mother of Sammy Davis, Jr., strong supporter of our efforts for more public appreciation of the tap dance skill, Mrs. Davis was our link between today's young dancers and the older masters. We will miss her council and influence.
