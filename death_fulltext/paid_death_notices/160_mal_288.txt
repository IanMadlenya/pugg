        FREE-Benjamin J. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) deeply mourn the passing of Benjamin J. Free of Palm Beach, Fla., an outstanding leader and long-time supporter. Taking to heart the needs of Technion students, he established with his wife, Florence, the Ben & Florence Free Scholarship Fund, the Ben and Florence Free Chair in Management and lent substantial support to the Florence & Ben J. Free-Palm Beach Chapter Dormitory as well as to numerous other projects. He served as president and most recently as chairman of the board of the Palm Beach Chapter, and was a life trustee of the ATS Board of Regents and an honorary life member of the Technion International Board of Governors. As Technion Guardians, Ben & Florence reached the highest level of support. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Florence and the entire Free family.
