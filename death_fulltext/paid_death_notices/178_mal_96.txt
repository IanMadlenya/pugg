        PERRY-John W., 38. NYPD lawyer, died a hero September 11 volunteering to rescue victims of the WTC attack. Civil libertarian and cop, down-to-earth free spirit, actor, linguist, with his restless mind, he questioned authority but played by the rules, housed the homeless, sought challenges of mind and body, packing a wallop in his time on earth. As board member of NYCLU Nassau Chapter, and son of former chapter president, Patricia Perry, he carried on his family's dedication to liberty and justice for all. He leaves also his father, Dr. James Perry, brother Joel, sister Janice and nephew Jimmy. Service are on Saturday, November 10, 11 AM, First Presbyterian Church, 12 West 12th Street, New York City. In lieu of flowers, family asks donation to favorite charity or to NYCLU Nassau Foundation (John W. Perry Memorial Fund), 210 Old Country Road, Mineola, New York 11501.
