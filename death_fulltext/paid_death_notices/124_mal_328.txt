        LEHMANN-Manfred. We are stunned and saddened to learn of the passing of our beloved friend and teacher. He was a giant as a committed Jew; a highly respected scholar, newspaper columnist and author of a new book just released. He was involved in every aspect of Jewish life in the U.S., in Israel and around the world. Condolences to his wife Anne, children and grandchildren who loved him with all their hearts. May his family sustain strength in the memory of his tremendous achievements and his endless love for his family. Esther and Harry Walker
