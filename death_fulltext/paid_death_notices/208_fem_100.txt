        POTASH--Sarah Bennett. The Yeshiva University family is saddened by the passing of a respected and compassionate member of the Jewish community, who enacted many deeds of loving kindness. She was the wife of the late Henry Potash and cherished mother of Robert Bennett Potash, as well as the adored sister of YU Benefactor, Carl Bennett, and Henry Bennett and Esther Brandwein. Our heartfelt condolences are extended to the entire family. May they all be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M.
