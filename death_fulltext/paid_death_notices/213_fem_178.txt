        BELLET--Marilyn. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) mourn the loss of their dear and stalwart friend and benefactor, Marilyn Bellet of Hilton Head Island, SC. Formerly of Philadelphia, Mrs. Bellet, a devoted member of the Society's National Board of Directors, was also active on the Philadelphia Chapter Board. The daughter of late Technion Guardians, Louis and Bessie Stein, who reached the highest level of commitment to the ATS, Technion and Israel, Mrs. Bellet and her sisters, Ruth Nathanson and Audrey Merves, followed in their parents' tradition of giving and generously supported the Technion through the Louis and Bessie Stein Foundation. They established the Louis and Bessie Stein Teaching Center of Excellence in Neurodegenerative Diseases and the Louis and Bessie Stein Foundation Research Fund for Neurodegenerative Diseases. We extend our sincere condolences to Mrs. Bellet's husband, Edward; children Sally and Laura Bellet, Iris Karamansa and Ellen Bellet; sisters Ruth Nathanson and Audrey Merves; and the entire Bellet family.
