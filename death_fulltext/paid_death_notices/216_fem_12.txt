        NATHANIEL--Semha Sheena. Born in 1922 in Baghdad, Iraq. Died on December 14, 2004. One of six children who survived into adulthood, she was born following her father, Sassoon Sheena's, miraculous return home after seven years of hiding from his Ottoman captors during WWI. She was thus named ''Semha'', meaning a joyous event. As an exceptionally intelligent youngster, and a child of enlightened parents, she spent summers studying in her beautiful and beloved Lebanon, and finished high school as a top student in all of Iraq. With these credentials, at the age of 15, the determined ''slip of a girl'' convinced the Minister of Education to allow her admission to the Royal College of Medicine in Baghdad, as the first and only Jewish female student. She completed her MD, traveled widely in the region with her colleagues, and practiced medicine in Baghdad. In approximately 1946, Semha traveled to England and Scotland pursuing post-graduate training, and in 1948 accepted an invitation to sail on the Queen Mary to the USA. In New York, she was introduced to the fledgling Iraqi Jewish community, and met and married George Nathaniel, also of Baghdad. They became US citizens, raised three children and remained together until George's death in January of this year. Semha was an extremely intelligent, perceptive, compassionate, clever and trustworthy woman, in many ways ahead of her time. She was an advisor, confidant and ''guardian angel'' to very many in the Iraqi Jewish community. She is survived by one daughter, two sons, and eight grandchildren.
