        CORTESE -- Armand, M.D. The Department of Surgery deeply mourns the loss of our distinguished colleague, Dr. Armand Cortese, Clinical Associate Professor Emeritus of Surgery. His internationally renowned professional career as a thoracic and general surgeon at New York Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center spanned over 50 years. Earning his medical degree from Cornell University Medical College in 1958, he completed his residency at The New York Hospital in 1966, and joined the attending staff in 1967. Over the years, he played a vital role and made significant contributions as a surgeon, teacher and mentor and he will be sorely missed. We express our profound sympathy to his wife Patricia, his children Amanda and Kevin, his brother Edward and sister Mimi, his many devoted patients and all who loved him.
