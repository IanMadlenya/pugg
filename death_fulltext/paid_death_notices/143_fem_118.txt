        MELZER-Theda. Devoted wife of the late Rudy, adored mother of Renee and Allan, doting grandmother of Alissa and Jared, loving sister of Ruth. The most gracious, giving, considerate and kindest person to grace the Earth. Her warmth and her caring touched us all, and made our lives that much more special. May she rest in peace forever.
