        KIRSCHNER--Andrew C. It is with deep sorrow and affection that The New York Times mourns the death of our colleague, Andrew C. Kirschner, on November 8th. Andy's grace, perseverance, strength, and perspective throughout his long illness inspired us all. He was a hero and a friend, possessing a determination and optimism truly extraordinary. All of us at The Times extend our sympathies to his wife, Barbara, who was his inspiration, their two daughters, Hallie and Alexi and their family.
