        MATISSE-Maria-Gaetana. The Trustees and staff of the Morgan Library mourn the death of MariaGaetana Matisse, who died in NYC on April 7, 2001. She was the widow of the art dealer Pierre Matisse. A generous and loyal friend to the Morgan, Tana Matisse was a member of the Director's Roundtable and of the Visiting Committee of the Department of Drawings and Prints. The Pierre and Maria-Gaetana Matisse Foundation was established soon after Mr. Matisse's death in 1989 by his heirs. In 1998, the Library was honored to receive from the Foundation the entire archive of the Pierre Matisse Gallery. This great gift is a major resource for all scholars interested in the origins of 20th-century art in America. Charles E. Pierce, Jr., Director S. Parker Gilbert, President, Board of Trustees
