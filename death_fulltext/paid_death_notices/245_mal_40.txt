        UBELL--Earl. The Council for the Advancement of Science Writing (CASW) mourns the passing of its co-founder, Earl Ubell, a trailblazing science writer, who helped enrich for the millions privileged to have borne witness to his extraordinary work in print and broadcast their understanding of the scientific quest and its consequences. He was also the inspiration to the many of us who were called to the craft by his splendid example. Cristine Russell, President Ben Patrusky, Executive Director
