        STERN-Israel. The Yeshiva University family mourns the passing of a dedicated longtime friend and leader, the dynamic and inspiring founder of the Upstate New York Friends of YU who, with his beloved wife, Pearl, was a YU Guardian; father of Jules (and Lila) Stern; and brother of Bessie (and Jack) Gulker, Irving (and Eve) Stern, Anne (and Joseph) Osofsky, and Dr. Abraham (and Malka) Stern. We extend our heartfelt condolences to grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
