        SCHLICHTER--Helen, age 85, died on January 12. She was married to the late Jerry Schlichter, a long-time teacher and assistant principal in the New York City school system. She is survived by her loving family: son, Arnold; daughter, Joanne: grandson, Levon; sister, Selma: brotherin-law, Milton Stier, and devoted caregiver, Rose. Helen was active in American Jewish Congress and the local civil rights movement on Long Island. With her husband, sister, and brother-in-law, she ran Camp Brydon Lake in the Catskills. In 1973, she and Jerry retired to Florida and Lenox, Massachusetts, to enjoy the music at Tanglewood. In 1999, she moved to Chicago to be close to her daughter. Music and reading were her great pleasures. A private family memorial will be held. In lieu of flowers, please make contributions to Changing Worlds, 329 W. 18th Street, Suite 611B, Chicago, IL 60616.
