        STICKNEY-Dorothy. The Board, Staff, Member Playwrights and Alumni of New Dramatists pay loving tribute to Dorothy Stickney, a leading light in the theater of this century. Her brilliant lifelong costar and beloved husband, Howard Lindsay, created and led New Dramatists almost 50 years ago with his writing partner, Russel Crouse, and a young playwright, Michaela O'Harra. They and fellow Broadway luminaries, John Golden, Rodgers & Hammerstein, Moss Hart and John Wharton, built a lasting safe haven for new writing talent, dedicated to artistic freedom and experimentation. Dorothy was a friend and champion, mentor and model for so many young theater artists. Their plays and musicals are born in The Lindsay and Crouse Studio at New Dramatists and will play the world's stages into the next millennium, carried on the wings of an angel in show biz 7th Heaven.
