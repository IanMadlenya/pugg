        EVANS-John A., M.D. The Boards, Faculty, and Staff of Weill Cornell Medical College and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital are deeply saddened by the passing of Dr. John A. Evans, a nationally renowned radiologist, who served as Chairman of the Department of Radiology and Radiologist-in-Chief at The New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center from 1952 until his retirement in 1976. A 1935 graduate of Cornell University Medical College, who became interested in radiology during his military service in World War II, Dr. Evans introduced the technique of nephrotomography, which is capable of distinguishing malignant kidney tumors from benign cysts, and which has been useful in the diagnosis of adrenal and other retroperitoneal tumors. He also led the development of intravenous cardiac angiography at the Medical Center. Dr. Evans was a recipient of the Maurice R. Greenberg Distinguished Service Award, the Medical Center's highest honor. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his family. Antonio M. Gotto, Jr., M.D., D.Phil Dean, Weill Cornell Medical College Herbert Pardes, M.D. President and CEO NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital
