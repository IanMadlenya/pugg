        LILIENSTEIN-Natalie. Mother, friend, wife, social activist and community organizer; a beautiful, caring woman with an indomitable spirit and sunshine bright smile has reluctantly bid us farewell. She leaves behind her two devoted children, Nan Shuker and Alan Ross, someone who was like a daughter, Janice Dompke, and so many special friends and confidantes it is impossible to mention; all of whom are in her debt for the kindness, sensitivity and support she offered freely, without condition. A lifelong activist and humanitarian, working with organizations ranging from the NAACP, Women's Strike for Peace, Southern Christian Leadership Conference, League of Women Voters and the Morris Dees Center for Peace and Justice to Victims Services Agency, Greenwich Village Coalition and the Samaritans Suicide Prevention Center, Natalie was an advocate for the elderly, women, minorities, the oppressed and all victims of political tyranny. She was someone who sought out the good in everyone and, by touching them, made them better; someone who always looked on ''the bright side of life.'' She has joined her beloved late husband, Emil Lilienstein, and we know they are once again holding hands and happy to be together. We celebrate her life and spirit knowing she leaves us having made the world a warmer, and better, place. Friends and family are invited to a memorial in her honor to be held Sunday, June 14, 2PM at Grace Church School, 86 Fourth Avenue (at 11th Street). In lieu of flowers, donations in her memory to The Samaritans of NY, PO Box 1259, New York, New York 10159
