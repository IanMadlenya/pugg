        DENSEN-Paul M. The Lautenberg Research Center of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem mourns with profound sorrow the passing of Paul M. Densen, Chairman of the Lautenberg Research Center Endowment Committee. Paul was the pioneering and outstanding leader on a daily basis for over 20 years in his service to the Lautenberg Center. His service to the Jewish people and to all of humanity had no peer. His commitment to ''Tikun Olam,'' repairing the world, and to the welfare of his fellow human beings motivated many others to follow his example, and his contributions to the eradication of cancer and other immunological diseases will be noted for generations to come. We extend heartfelt condolences to his wife, Sarah Jane; his sons, Mark and Robert, and his entire family. The Lautenberg Research Center U.S. Senator Frank R. Lautenberg Founding Patron Dr. David Weiss Founding Chairman, Jerusalem Dr. Eitan Yefenof Chairman, Jerusalem Eleanore Popeck-Rigolosi Co-Chair, Executive Committee Milton Spielman Co-Chair, Executive Committee Paul Einhorn, Chairman Research Associates Society Carmi Schwartz Executive Vice Chairman
