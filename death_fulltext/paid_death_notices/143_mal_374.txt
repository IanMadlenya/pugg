        ROSEN-Maurice M. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) express profound sorrow at the loss of Maurice M. Rosen of Bryn Mawr, PA, a guiding force in our organization. During his more than 40years of exemplary devotion, Mr. Rosen helped found the Philadelphia Chapter, served as ATS national president and chairman, and founded the ATS endowment fund. He served on the Technion International Board of Governors and was its deputy director. As a Technion Guardian, he demonstrated the highest level of commitment to the Technion, the ATS and Israel. With his family, he established the Maurice M. and Ruben P. Rosen Solid State Physics Building. For his outstanding contributions, he was awarded an Honorary Fellowship and an Honorary Doctorate from the Technion. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Michele, and to the entire Rosen family. American Society for TechnionIsrael Institute of Technology Lawrence S. Jackier, President Irving A. Shepard, Chairman Melvyn H. Bloom, Executive VP Irwin L. Gross, Greater Delaware Valley Chapter President Ivan Schonfeld, Eastern Seaboard Region Director
