        DiMaggio-Joe. The officers, Board of Governors and members of the Columbus Citizens Foundation deeply mourn the loss of our honorary member, Joe DiMaggio. He brought a sense of pride to the Italian American community at a time when being an Italian American was not always easy. He offered hope and joy to many. The quiet dignity and grace in which he lived his life was an inspiration to us all. We say farewell to a legendary Italian American athlete who served as Grand Marshall of the Columbus Day Parade. We extend our deepest sympathies to his family for a loss that is felt by many. Hon. Charles A. Gargano, President Columbus Citizens Foundation
