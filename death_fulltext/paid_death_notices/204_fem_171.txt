        GOLDSTEIN -- Helen Fried Kirshblum. ''She opens her mouth to impart wisdom; and the teaching of kindness is ever on her tongue'' (Proverbs 31:26). We mourn the passing of Helen Fried Kirshblum Goldstein, beloved mother of our trustee, Arthur Fried, who has continued in her path of wise counsel and righteous deeds. She has served as a model of leadership, dedication, and courage for the Jewish community in the United States and beyond. We extend our condolences to the Goldstein and Fried families. May they be comforted among th mourners of Zion, and may the memory of Helen be for a blessing. The Trustees of The Shalem Foundation
