        TAFTI--Dr. Joan Herz. Mother, wife, daughter, sister, (46) passed away at home last Sunday. Joan was devoted to her family and friends and was the loving mother of Ariana, age 10, the joy of her life. Joan was the cherished wife of Peter in whom she found a friend and life partner. Joan is survived by her devoted mother and father, Leslie and Dr. Marvin Herz. She is also survived by her sister Suzanne and husband Marc Daniel, her brother Joseph and wife Beth, nieces Julia and Jane, nephew Nicholas and father-in-law, Shapoor Tafti. As a psychologist, Joan helped her patients to cope more effectively with the problems of life, its challenges and blessings. When she entered a room, immediately it became suffused with warmth. Joan always maintained a positive attitude even while courageously fighting cancer over the past few years of her life. She was a graduate of Tulane, Harvard and Columbia Universities and served as an Adjunct Assistant Professor of Psychology and Education at Columbia University. Knowing Joan has greatly enriched the lives of all who knew her. A memorial service for friends and family will be held in late April. In lieu of flowers, please make a donation to the American Cancer Society.
