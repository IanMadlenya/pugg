        RUBIN-Ira Lloyd, M.D. It is with great sadness that the death of Ira Lloyd Rubin, M.D. on February 12 is announced. He was the beloved husband of Beatrice Bober Rubin for more than 57 years and the devoted son of the late Dr. Meyer and the late Gertrude Rubin. He is survived by his wife and brother Dr. Adrien Rubin. He was a gifted cardiologist who was greatly loved by both his patients and medical staff. He was the author of numerous classic textbooks and articles on the diagnosis and treatment of heart disease. He was a great philanthropic leader who devoted his time and energy in making this world a better place for all its inhabitants. Dr. Rubin served on Guam as a Major in the United States Army during World War II. He was an attending physician at Montefiore Medical Center since 1949 and a Professor of Medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. When the Department of Electrocardiography at Montefiore was dedicated in his name in 1993, the plaque that was erected so aptly states: ''A leader, a gifted ECG reader, teacher, author, physician, humanitarian and gentleman.'' Funeral services are strictly private. A memorial service celebrating his life will be held at a later date. Donations may be made in his memory to the United Jewish Appeal.
        RUBIN-Ira L., M.D. The Albert Einstein College of Medicine mourns the passing of a distinguished member of our faculty for more than 30 years. He was a wonderful teacher, a world renowned leader in cardiology, and the author of numerous books and articles on the subject. We extend our deep condolences to his wife, Beatrice, and to his family. Dominick P. Purpura, M.D., Dean
