        MIJUSKOVIC-Milutin B. (D.M.S.) The students, faculty, and staff of the New York University College of Dentistry record with profound sadness the loss on May 10, 1999 of our beloved teacher, colleague, and friend, Dr. Milutin ''Mike'' Mijuskovic, Associate Professor of Basic Sciences (Oral Medicine and Pathology). His devotion to the NYU College of Dentistry, the dental profession, and the community inspired us all. He will be deeply missed. Deepest sympathy to his long time companion Dr. Wilma Shochat.
