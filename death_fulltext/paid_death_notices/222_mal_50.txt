        FONTANA--Vincent J., M.D. The Board of Trustees and Staff of The New York Foundling and the Vincent J. Fontana Center for Child Protection mourn the sudden passing of our esteemed and beloved Medical Director and Pediatrician-in-Chief, Dr. Vincent J. Fontana. During his 43 year career at The Foundling, Dr. Fontana fought tirelessly for the rights and protection of mistreated children. Following his groundbreaking article, ''The Maltreatment Syndrome in Children,'' first published in The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Fontana authored over 150 scientific publications and texts, including, ''Save the Family, Save the Child'' and ''Somewhere a Child is Crying,'' texts which have had a profound influence on the field of child abuse prevention. The Crisis Nursery/Family Center that Dr. Fontana established at The Foundling in 1972 continues as a national model as an ''island of safety for at risk families.'' With the opening of the Fontana Center on Christopher Street in November 2004, we are ensured that his legacy of building public awareness, advancing research, and training professionals in the field of child abuse prevention will endure. We extend our deepest sympathies to his brother and sister and large extended family. Plans for a memorial service will be announced at a later date. William F.
