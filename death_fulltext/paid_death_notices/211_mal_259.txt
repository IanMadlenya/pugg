        WEINSTEIN--Milton. Age 82, passed away on August 27, 2004. Predeceased by Lenore, his loving wife of 57 years. Survived by his children Laurel and Lawrence Rosenbluth, Richard Weinstein and David Rockwell, grandchildren Meredith and Stewart Eichner and great-granddaughters Hailey and Emily. Milt was a retired real estate broker and WWII Veteran, and an extraordinarily selfless and devoted husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather. No finer gentleman nor gentle man could ever be found--how dearly he will be missed. In lieu of flowers contributions to the Hebrew Home for the Aged of Riverdale would be appreciated.
