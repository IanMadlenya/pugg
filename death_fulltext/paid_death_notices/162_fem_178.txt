        BERELSON-Thelma D. The Board of Directors and Educational Outreach Program Staff of The National Book Foundation extend condolences to Ellen Berelson on the passing of her beloved mother. We cherished our friendship with Thelma, just as we were deeply grateful for the faithful philanthropy of her late husband, Irving. Our institutional family has been irrevocably diminished.
