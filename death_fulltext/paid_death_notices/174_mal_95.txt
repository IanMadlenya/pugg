        PINES-Leonard. Founder of Hebrew National Kosher Foods, the company that promises to ''answer to a higher authority,'' died on Wednesday, July 4th. He was 90. Pines' father, Isadore Pinkowitz, a Romanian immigrant, founded the Hebrew National Kosher Sausage Factory in 1905, producing kosher frankfurters and selling them from a wagon on Manhattan's Lower East Side until his death in 1936. Pinkowitz's eldest son, Leonard, took over the company and built it into the largest kosher brand in America, whose many famous products included hot dogs, salami, corned beef, pastrami, and deli condiments. The company's success proved there was a market for kosher beyond Jewish consumers. Pines was married for 48 years to Mary Zucker, who died in 1981. He lost his second wife, Jeanette Weinstein, in 1999. Pines is survived by four children: Myrna, Isadore (''Skip''), Paula, and Kenneth. He has 13 grandchildren and 10 greatgrandchildren.
