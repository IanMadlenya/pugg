        COOKE--M. Todd. The family of The Curtis Institute of Music mourns the loss of its longtime trustee and former chairman, M. Todd Cooke, and extends deepest sympathy to his wife, Peggy, and family. The city of Philadelphia has lost one of its great civic leaders and the world of music, especially chamber music, a great friend.
