        MACKENZIE-Alexander Innes. Of Chappaqua, NY. 65. Died October 31, 2000, of colon cancer. Alec's wit, optimism and passion for history, music, art and sports will be greatly missed by his wife, Nora, his daughter Vickie, his brother Archie and his many friends. His daughter Katey predeceased him in 1987. We were thrilled by Alec's first round victory in Jeopardy's 1994 Seniors Tournament. A memorial service will be held Tuesday, November 7, at the Union Church in Pocantico Hills, NY, at 2 PM. Donations may go to the '57 Scholars Fund at Williams College, Williamstown, MA 01267. You're a better man than I am, Gunga Din!
