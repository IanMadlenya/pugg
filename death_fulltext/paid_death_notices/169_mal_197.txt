He is survived by his sons Steve, John and Tom and by John's wife Ellabaff. Elliott received a B.A. from City College, New York, in 1938 and an M.B.A. with Distinction from Harvard in 1940.

A home-builder and developer in New Jersey, he was President of Elliott Construction Company until 1969 and retired to California in 1983 after holding managerial positions with Boise Cascade, J.H. Snyder Company and Larry Mayer & Company in Chicago. Elliott had long been an active advocate for the mentally ill and, with his late wife, was a co-founding member of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) in 1979. He served two terms as President of the California Alliance for the Mentally Ill (CAMI) and received the organization's Lifetime Achievement Award in 1997. As Elliott desired, no formal funeral services will be held, but the family would appreciate donations in his memory to either the California Alliance for the Mentally Ill (CAMI), 1111 Howe Ave, Suite 475, Sacramento, CA 95825, or The Alameda County Mental Health Association, (ACMHA), 1801 Adeline St., Oakland, CA 94607.
