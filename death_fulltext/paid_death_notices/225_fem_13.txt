        MOTLEY--Constance Baker. Dean David Schizer and the students, faculty and staff of Columbia Law School mourn the death of Constance Baker Motley, graduate of the Columbia Law School Class of 1946. While studying law at Columbia, she met Thurgood Marshall and began her illustrious career in the civil rights movement. Judge Motley won nine of the 10 cases she argued before the U.S. Supreme Court, as well as the landmark desegregation case that gained James Meredith admission to the University of Mississippi (the danger of such work was made clear when her colleague in the case, Medgar Evers, was murdered). Her intellect and legal acumen were fundamental to many civil rights victories won by more visible leaders like Thurgood Marshall and Martin Luther King, Jr., whom she once counseled in a four-by-six jail cell in rural Georgia. In the early 1960s, she served as a New York state senator and as Manhattan borough president, the first African-American woman to hold either office. She subsequently became the first black woman appointed to a federal judgeship, and served with distinction on the bench of the Southern District of New York. In this time of sadness, we are reminded of the announcement accompanying her Presidential Citizens Medal in 2000: ''As a dedicated public servant and distinguished judge, she has broken down political, social and professional barriers, and her pursuit of equal justice under law widened the circle of opportunity in America.''
        MOTLEY--Hon. Constance Baker, an illustrious and distinguished lady has left us with myriad memories of love, laughter, brilliance and countless moments of joy. May God attend you, my darling friend, and comfort your beloved husband Joel, your dearest son Joel and his loving wife Isolde and cherished grandchildren Hannah, Ian and Senay. Marjorie D.
