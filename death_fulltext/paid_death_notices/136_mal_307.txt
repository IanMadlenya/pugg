        KATZ-Jacob. The Center for Israel and Jewish Studies, Columbia University, mourns the passing in Jerusalem of Professor Jacob Katz, one of the greatest Jewish scholars of our century. Born in Hungary and educated in Germany, he taught Jewish history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem from 1950 and served as the rector of that university for several years. Since his retirement, he continued to publish seminal books and articles on Jewish history and culture through the ages. We extend our sympathies to his family. May his memory be for a blessing.
