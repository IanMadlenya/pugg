        FREEMAN-Morris (Marty). A printer and teletype operator at the New York Times for more than twenty years died in his sleep on Saturday, October 7 at the Village Nursing Home in Greenwich Village, his home for the past year. A W.W. II veteran stationed in Africa, he began his life-long love affair with photography, people of the street and his family being his favorite subject matter. Marty began his career as a printer at The Journal of Commerce and The New York Daily Mirror. When the Mirror folded, he joined The New York Times, first as a printer and then as a teletype operator. He retired from the Times in 1980 to spend time taking pictures and developing them in his own makeshift darkroom. Marty was also an avid reader and sports enthusiast. Known as Marty to his friends and family, he leaves behind his ex-wife of 35 years, Sue Stein Freeman, his daughter, folk artist Dena Stewart (Miami Beach, FL.), and his two loving sons, Larry Freeman, L.C.S.W., and avant-garde jewelry designer Stuart Freeman (both residing in NYC) and sisters, Henrietta Freeman and Faye Colon. Services were held last Sunday at Gramercy Park Memorial Chapel, 152 2nd Avenue and he is interned at Mt. Zion Cemetery in Queens, New York. In lieu of flowers, donations in his honor can be sent to his favorite charity, Center for Folk and Community Art (CFCA), 1800 Michigan Avenue, Miami Beach, Florida 33139.
