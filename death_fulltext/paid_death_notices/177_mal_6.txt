        KAHAN-Michael. Brooklyn College mourns the passing of Professor Micheal Kahan, Department of Political Science. Professor Kahan was a devoted teacher and mentor for nearly 30 years. Frequently sought after as an expert and commentator on the local and national political scene, he recently authored ''Media as Politics: Theory, Behavior and Change in America.'' His generous spirit and strong presence will be greatly missed by his department, the campus community and beyond. Christoph M. Kimmich, President Brooklyn College
