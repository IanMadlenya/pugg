        ADAMS - Frederick B. The Trustees and staff of The Pierpont Morgan Library mourn the death of Frederick B. Adams, who died in Chisseaux, France, on January 7, 2001. He was 90 years old. He served, with distinction, as the second Director of the Library from 1948 to 1969. Mr. Adams, an internationally renowned bibliophile, had a great and lasting impact on the development of the Library. After his retirement, from his home in Paris, he remained an active proponent of culture and education in America and abroad. We extend deepest sympathies to his widow Marie-Louise de Croy Adams and his entire family. Charles E. Pierce, Jr., Director S. Parker Gilbert, President, Board of Trustees
