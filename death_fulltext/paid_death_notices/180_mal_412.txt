        DRAPKIN - Arnold, M.D. We mourn the untimely death of a man whose golden hands found breast cancer before the mammogram (the sonogram he ordered confirmed his skills) and whose wonderful capacity to listen and care was unique. He said that when you enter your seventies, you enter a minefield. He was killed off too early. Irreplaceable. Dolores and Bruce Rogers
        DRAPKIN-Arnold, M.D. My Doctor, Thank you for 30 years of care, support and kindness. You are so deeply missed.
