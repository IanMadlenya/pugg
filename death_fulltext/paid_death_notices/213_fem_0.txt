        COCHRANE -- Katherine Prince Schirmer. Among the talented and committed young policy advisors who served in Jimmy Carter's White House, Kitty Schirmer (Cochrane) was a superstar. More than any other individual beneath the President, she shaped the contours of the environmental and energy policy initiatives of that era. We loved Kitty for her humor, grace, commitment to her friends and love of life. Cabinet officers and titans of industry who underestimated her intelligence and skills learned important lessons in the art of governance. She was a towering lady whom we love and who left us far too soon. Bert, Carolyn, David, Fran, Frank, Jane, Orin, Ralph, Si and Stu
