        LASH--Trude. The Board of Directors and the Council of the Foundation for Child Development express their sadness at the loss of our distinguished colleague, Trude Lash, who made significant contributions to developing the field of childhood social indicators. She was the principal investigator of State of the Child: New York City I (1976) and II (1980), which presented for the first time comprehensive data about the quality of life for children living in New York City. These reports inspired similar examinations in cities and states throughout the United States, and highlighted the need for responsive public policies for children and their families. We wish to offer sympathy to her family and friends P. Lindsay Chase-Lansdale, Chair, Board of Directors Eleanor T. Elliott Chair of the Council Ruby Takanishi, President
