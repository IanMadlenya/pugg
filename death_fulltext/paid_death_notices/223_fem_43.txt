        KIMBALL--Beatriz Gabaldon. Many will mourn the passing of Beatriz Gabaldon Kimball who died on July 29, 2005, at the age of 87. She died peacefully within 30 hours of suffering a massive stroke from which she did not regain consciousness. Beatriz was a resident of Cambridge, MA., where she had gone to live to be near her beloved niece, Julia Gabaldon. She was born in Clifton, Arizona, February 22, 1918, and spent her years before college in southeastern Arizona. She graduated from the University of California at Berkeley in l940, which served to launch her career as an international civil servant that took her to many parts of the world, beginning with 5 years in Paris for the newly formed United Nations Education, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). In the early 1950's she continued to expand her career with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in New York City. During the next 20 years, she was posted to assignments in Bolivia, Peru, Lebanon and the Middle East, Indonesia, Cyprus, and the Dominican Republic. She was married to Richard Kimball of Massachusetts during her stay in Bolivia and divorced a few years later. Her final U.N. post was that of Deputy Resident Representative to the Dominican Republic. She retired in l978 and spent the next 24 years as a happy resident of Meredith, New Hampshire. Beatriz Kimball was a beautiful, brave, and generous woman who could charm the proverbial birds from the trees. She helped many people, not only financially, but with her sunny, loving hospitality, and her understanding. She loved life, music (particularly opera) and her many friends from all over the world. She is survived by her brother, Robert Gabaldon, of Great Falls, VA., and his family, and her sister-in-law, Henrietta Gabaldon, of Pasadena, CA.
