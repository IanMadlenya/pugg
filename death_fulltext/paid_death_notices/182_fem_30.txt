        HUTNER-Margarita Silva. The faculty of the Department of Dermatology of Columbia University acknowledges with deep sympathy the passing of Dr. Margarita Silva-Hutner, a distinguished scholar and a beloved teacher and mentor of so many. She made pioneering contributions to the development of medical mycology and dermatology and was a distinguished member of our faculty for over fifty years. Her scientific contributions were matched by her humanism and her personal charm and she set standards of excellence that will endure. A memorial service will be held Wednesday, March 20 at 12 noon in the Department of Dermatology at Columbia University. David R. Bickers, M.D., Chairman Department of Dermatology College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University
