        STERN--Laura, of Aventura, Florida, on November 29. Beloved wife of the late Jerry Stern. Cherished mother and mother-in-law of the late Sandy and Marcia Stern. Adored grandmother of Lisa, Adam and Geoffrey Stern. Fun-loving sister of Red and Morris Remin, and the late Jack, Dave and Irving Lupu. Always the belle of the ball, she ran Lupu's Dress Shop in Brooklyn with panache. Her grand sense of humor will be missed by all.
