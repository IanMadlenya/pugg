        AKIN-Robert M., III, The Trustees and Alumni Board Directors of Hackley School are deeply saddened by the loss of their colleague of thirty years. Bob Akin was a man of many passions; racing was one, Hackley was another. In both arenas he earned incredible respect and forged enduring friendships. The school as we know it today would not exist had Bob not cared so deeply for Hackley. Our heartfelt sympathy to his family.
        AKIN-Robert M. III. Your intelligence, wise counsel, wicked wit and sense of fun will be missed deeply. But the generosity with which you shared yourself with others in life has left indelible lessons to guide us in your physical absence. That laugh will be forever inescapable in our memories. We hug you with the same ferocity with which you hugged us. See ya! Jack and Veronica
        AKIN-Robert. We mourn the loss of our dear, dear friend. We thank you for your courage, your character, your integrity, your humor and your devotion to excellence. And we thank you for sharing all those things with us. Jim and Kevin Abernathy
        AKIN-Robert. Our founder, our leader, our hero. ''The Boys Club'' Old Stone Market, Springs
