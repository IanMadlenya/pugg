        FELTER-Rose (Brady). Died peacefully at the age of 103, on June 14, 2001. Born in the year that NYC was incorporated, through three different centuries, Rosie witnessed the City evolve from the gaslights and the first car on the streets of Greenwich Village to high speed internet access through her television. A lifelong Democrat (''Tammany Hall or no hall at all''), Rosie was a poll watcher for many years and avidly followed the local and national political scenes. On her 100th birthday, she received personal messages from the President, Senator Ted Kennedy, the Governor and the Mayor and a ceremonial inscribed brick from Stuyvesant Town where she resided since it opened 50 years ago. Although she was a widow for most of her life and only had one child, the late Joseph Harold, who retired as an Army Colonel after 32 years of active duty around the world, her progeny is remarkable. She had nine grandchildren, including a career Army officer, two doctors, a business woman, a lawyer, an interior designer, a nurse, an independent film maker and a web site designer, and at last count, 25 great-grandchildren and four great-great-grandchildren. When asked to explain her longevity, Rosie would respond ''I guess the good Lord doesn't want me and the devil is afraid I'll take his job.'' Contributions may be made in Rosie's name to the Immaculate Conception Church, where she was a parishioner for over 50 years, 414 East 14th Street, NY, NY 10009. A Mass of Celebration will be held at the church on Wednesday at 10 AM. Family will receive friends at the Andrett Funeral Home, 353 Second Ave (at 20th St), NYC, Tuesday, 2-5 and 7-9 PM. Interment to follow at Calvary Cemetery.
