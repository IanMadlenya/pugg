        KEYES--Gary, artist, beloved son and brother, uncle and dear friend, died February 12, 2007, in Las Vegas, after a short illness. Born October 13, 1959, in Bay City, Michigan, Gary graduated with a Bachelor's from Kalamazoo College in 1982 and moved to New York City. In 1990 he opened a hand-crafted pottery company in Brooklyn. His work was shown at the Whitney Museum and galleries in New York, Long Island, and Provincetown. He recently turned his gift for gardening into a successful landscaping business. Gary was a gourmet cook, a voracious reader, and could complete the Sunday New York Times crossword in ink, in 30 minutes. He was a gracious host, wonderful friend and generous man. He is survived by his mother Ruth Keyes, his brothers Kevin and Derek Keyes, his sister Kristen James, and his nieces Miranda and Devon James. A memorial service will take place in the spring.
