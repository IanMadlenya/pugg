        GARDINER--Katharine Hone Emmet Bramwell, died peacefully August 18, 2003 in Princeton, NJ, aged 88. Daughter of Helen (Auerbach) and Herman LeRoy Emmet, and a descendant of both New York's Mayor Philip Hone and NY State's Attorney General Thomas Addis Emmet, Kate leaves her wonderful husband, Henry Gardiner of Quogue, NY, daughter Heidi Bramwell Humes, granddaughters Julia Emmet Bramwell Frick, Heidi Hamilton Kerko and Helena Humes Martin, and one greatgrandson, Henry Wilder Martin. Kate was the sister of Lydia Emmet Williams of Cleveland, and the late Anne Emmet Aaron, Helena Emmet Tredway and Herman LeRoy Emmet Jr. Kate's first husband of almost 50 years, Gerald Ames Bramwell, and two of their children, Katharine Bramwell Hamilton and Gerald Ames Bramwell Jr. predeceased her. Known by her family and many friends for her enthusiasm, intelligence, range of interests and generosity, Kate graduated from St. Timothy's as a proud member of the Spider team, and attended Smith College before marrying in 1934. An early advocate of natural products and organic farming, Kate was also a devoted bird watcher who created a bird sanctuary behind her Princeton, NJ house (which she later donated to the YWCA). An adventurous traveler and opera lover, she was a Board member and supporter of many organizations, including the North Country School in Lake Placid, NY. A proud and involved member of the Emmet family, Kate was our historian, collector of artifacts and raconteur. Her warm and vital presence will be deeply missed by those lucky enough to have known and loved her. Contributions in Kate's honor may be made to the North Country School, PO Box 187, Lake Placid, NY 12946. A memorial service will be held on Memorial Day weekend 2004 in Keene Valley, New York.
