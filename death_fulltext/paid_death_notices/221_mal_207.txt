        COHEN--Isidore. The Musicians, Board and Staff of the Marlboro Music School and Festival mourn the loss of a dear and generous friend, devoted mentor of young musicians at Marlboro for four decades, and an invaluable member of three of the 20th century's most important chamber music ensembles--the Schneider and Juilliard String Quartets, and Beaux Arts Trio. As we celebrate his life and contribution to Marlboro and to music, we extend our deepest sympathy to Erica and Ana Luz, Allen and Ana, who remain cherished members of the Marlboro Family.
