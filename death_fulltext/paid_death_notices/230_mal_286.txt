        VIDICH--Arthur J. The New School notes with sadness the death of sociologist Arthur J. Vidich on March 16. His more than 40 years of teaching at The New School for Social Research and his numerous books and articles, including the classic ''Small Town in Mass Society'', have influenced generations of social scientists. The University is planning a memorial gathering at its Greenwich Village campus in mid-September. Details will be available at www.newschool.edu or at 212.229.5700 ext 3125.
