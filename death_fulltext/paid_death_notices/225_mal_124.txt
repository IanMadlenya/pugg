        DIBNER--David. ''Words without deeds are nothing. One must show by way of example.'' Ben-Gurion said these words and David Dibner lived them. The officers and Board of Governors of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev are deeply saddened by the passing of our friend and benefactor, David, who was a source of inspiration in the world of business and philanthropy to Israel and the Jewish people. We send our deepest condolences to his beloved wife, Frances, his children Brent, Daniel and Mark, and the entire family. Roy Zuckerberg, Chairman, Robert H. Arnow, Chairman Emeritus, of BGU Board of Governors and Prof. Avishay Braverman, President, BenGurion University
