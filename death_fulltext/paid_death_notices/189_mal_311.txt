        KRAUSS-Marvin A. All the associates from Marvin A. Krauss Associates mourn the loss of our teacher, mentor, and friend. He was a one-ofa-kind giant in the annals of Broadway and in our hearts. Creative, loyal, fair, funny, generous, and a force to be reckoned with. We will miss him. From us all, too many to list
        KRAUSS-Marvin. We deeply mourn the passing of our dear friend, with whom we shared 45 years of good times and bad bridge. Our condolences and love to Elaine, the best wife to the best husband, and to the children. The London Bridgers
