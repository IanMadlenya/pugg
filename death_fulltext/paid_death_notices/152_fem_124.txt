        MARSH-Alice F. Died peacefully at home on Sunday September 12, 1999, at the age of 95. Growing up in Yorkville, the daughter of Alice Farley, a single mother, Alice knew poverty first hand. When others left to go to work, her mother insisted she continue her education, and she did. A fighter for social justice, she joined the Socialist Party with her husband John Marsh, and was a founding member of The United Federation of Teachers. Alice was a NYC elemen/jr HS teacher for 35 yrs, then became the first UFT Legislative Rep in Albany. For sixteen years she was instrumental in getting legislation passed that improved working conditions and pensions for teachers. She was a passionate believer in public education and the separation of church and state. A consummate storyteller, Alice could always command an audience. A true heroine and optimist to the very end. She will be missed by her family who adored her, her son, Peter, daughter-inlaw, Carol, her beloved grandson, Ian, her sister, Frances Hodson, and her nieces and their families, Anne and Bob Lightburn, and Jeanette and Joe Radosta. Memorial services will be held on Friday September 17th, at 1:30 P.M. at Knight - Auchmoody Funeral Home, 154 East Main Street, Port Jervis, New York. For information contact: 914-856-3312. Contributions can be made in her memory to The UFT Albert Shanker Scholarship Fund, or Amnesty International.
