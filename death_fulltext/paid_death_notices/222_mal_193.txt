        MILLER--Norman. Beloved uncle and brother, distinguished football writer and columnist, died Thursday, July 14, in New York City, after a long decline in health. He was 87. Born October 28, 1917, in Springfield, Massachusetts, Mr. Miller graduated from the University of Michigan in 1942. After serving as a Navy Air Corps pilot in World War II, Mr. Miller began his long and extremely successful career as a sportswriter. He joined United Press International in 1946, where he covered all sports. In 1964 he joined the New York Daily News, and quickly became the paper's beat writer for the Giants football team, while continuing to cover primarily professional football during his two-decade career with the Daily News. Mr. Miller moved to Palm Springs, California, in 1980, where he continued writing as a West Coast correspondent for the Daily News and, later, for the New York Post. During this time he was also a pro-football columnist for the on-line news service, Sportsticker, until he retired in 1989. Football was Mr. Miller's lifelong passion, and he was highly regarded by all who knew him for writing with fairness, honesty and integrity. He was one of a handful of sportswriters who covered the first 37 Super Bowls, until illness prevented him from travelling. In 1981 he received the Dick McCann Memorial Award for long and distinguished writing in football, the highest honor awarded to writers in his profession. Mr. Miller counted among his close friends athletes, owners and peers alike, including Giants owner Wellington Mara and the late Giants General Manager George Young. He is survived by his younger brother, David Miller, of New York City; his nieces, Neredith Miller of New York City and Laurie Miller of Barboursville, VA; his nephew, Matthew Miller, and great-nephews, Ethan and Justin Miller, all of Colchester, VT. A memorial service will be held in New York City in the fall.
