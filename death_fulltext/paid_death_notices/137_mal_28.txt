        GOLDIN-Judah. The Jewish Theological Seminary Family records with sorrow the passing of Professor Judah Goldin, an esteemed graduate of JTS, where he earned his Rabbinic Ordination and doctorate, and for many years, a beloved member of its faculty and administration. As a pioneer in the field of Judaic studies in the University and a world class scholar in midrash, Professor Goldin influenced generations of students. He served as dean of the Teachers' Institute before leaving JTS in 1958 to become a professor of rabbinic literature at Yale University. He brought his distinguished career to a close at the University of Pennsylvania. May his memory be for a blessing. Ismar Schorsch, chancellor Gershon Kekst, board chairman
