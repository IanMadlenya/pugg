        RUZA-Irene. Hadassah, WZOA, mourns the death of our beloved colleague and friend Irene Ruza. Devoted to Hadassah, Israel and the Jewish people, Irene served as President of the Queens Region and was a member of the National Board for over 20 years. An ardent Zionist, she represented Hadassah at the World Zionist Congress in 1978 and 1982. Our deepest condolences to her family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
