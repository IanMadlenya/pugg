        OLSON-Miriam. We extend heartfelt condolences to Sidney Olson on the loss of his beloved wife, Miriam. To anyone who had the good fortune of knowing her, she was a source of happiness and joy. Miriam was a righteous woman who exemplified the qualities of elegance, grace and extraordinary dignity. The Olsons have personified throughout their lives the most profound values of Jewish tradition. Sidney's vision, leadership, and service as an Honorary Life Member of the International Board of Governors and as the Honorary Chairman of the medical center's Southeast Region, has made a vital difference to the health care needs of the people of Israel and has helped Shaare Zedek to develop an intenational reputation for excellence. May Sidney, his son Norman, his daughter Arlene, and his entire family have warm and loving memories of a very special and caring individual. May they be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. American Committee for Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem Erica Jesselson, Chair, Menno Ratzker, President Stuart Tauber, Executive Director
