        BALMUTH-Fay. The Officers and Directors of Metropolitan Jewish Geriatric Foundation sadly mourn the untimely passing of Fay Balmuth, beloved and esteemed daughter of our late founders, Phillip and Dora Brenner. Her involvement with our organization dates back, along with that of her dear family, more than half a century to the Brooklyn Hebrew Home and Hospital for the Aged, The Long Island League and other affiliates. A devoted friend and ardent supporter Fay will be greatly missed. May her legacy act as a source of inspiration to all those whom she touched. Our profound sympathy and sincere condolences to the family. John H. Wolff, Pres. Eli S. Feldman, Exec VP & CEO Norman B. Gildin, Exec. Dir.CDO
