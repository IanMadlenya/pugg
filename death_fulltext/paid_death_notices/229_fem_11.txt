        WASSERSTEIN -- Wendy. NYU's Tisch School of the Arts and the Rita and Burton Goldberg Department of Dramatic Writing note with deep sorrow the passing of Wendy Wasserstein, talented playwright, esteemed colleague, and valued friend. As a Goldberg Professor she was an admired faculty member, and as a teacher she was an inspiring role model and mentor to our students. She possessed a special light that would shine warmth and optimism on everyone she met. Her enormous talent was eclipsed only by her enormous heart. We shall miss her friendship but are grateful for the time we had with her. We extend our deepest condolences to her entire family.
