        ELLIOTT -- Jane Rader. Passed away peacefully on March 18, 2004. We will miss our beloved Jane Rader Elliott--our Scooter and Mom and Muzzy. She will be missed by her mother, Eleanor Rader, of Tulsa, OK and brother, John L. Rader of San Rafael, CA. She was the treasured wife of Wright, loving mother to Mike and Steve and David, adoring grandmother to Cara, Connor, Caitlyn, Sophie and Charlotte, and dearest friend to many. Jane was born on June 7, 1939 in Hobbs, NM, and a resident of Bronxville 40 years, where her devoted volunteer work will be lovingly remembered and sorely missed. She was a Director of Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville, on the Boards of Directors of the Counseling Center of Southern Westchester and the Junior League of Bronxville, President of the Women's Society of the Reformed Church of Bronxville, and a very active volunteer with the Botanical Garden of New York. Jane, you meant the world to all of us, and you will be in our hearts forever. We miss you already. Services at the Reformed Church of Bronxville, Thursday, March 25 at 11 AM.
