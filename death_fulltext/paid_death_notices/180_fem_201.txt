        BRUNO-Ida. The Lenox Hill Hospital expresses profound sorrow at the passing of our dear friend, Ida Bruno. The beloved wife of our esteemed colleague, Michael S.

Her unfailing devotion to her husband, her family, and her many friends was an inspiration to us all. Lenox Hill Hospital has lost a very special friend and we extend our heartfelt sympathies to Mike, their children, Mike Jr., Loretta and Pam, and to the entire Bruno family. James S.
