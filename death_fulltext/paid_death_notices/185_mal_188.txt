        SCHWEITZER-Jon Francis. Aged 44, of New York City, New York, succumbed to cancer on June 7, 2002. Jon lived his life to the fullest, and left this life with the grace and compassion that he demonstrated on a daily basis. In addition to immediate family in the Midwest, Jon leaves behind in New York a devoted family of friends who mourn his passing, but who are grateful for the time that we had with him. A celebration of Jon's life will be held at the Chapin School, 100 East End Avenue, at 5 PM, June 19, 2002. Donations in honor of Jon may be made to Chapin School Scholarship Fund or to Cabrini Hospice.
