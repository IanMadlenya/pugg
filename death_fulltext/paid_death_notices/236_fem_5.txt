        RUSH--Adele. It is with great sorrow that we announce the passing of Adele Rush, the matriarch of the Rush family. She was a stalwart for family values as well as an early pioneer for Hadassah, Zionism, and the state of our homeland Israel. Alvin and Marilyn, Jeffrey and Loni, her eight grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren are proud that she still remembered every name of these 28 family members. Services at Gutterman's, Woodbury, LI Sunday 10am.
