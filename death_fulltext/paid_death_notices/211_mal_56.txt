        CARTIER - BRESSON -- Henri. It is with profound sorrow that we note the passing of Henri Cartier-Bresson. For all of us at ICP, and the photographic community at large, Cartier-Bresson was a monumental figure who changed the history of photography and whose profound influence will long be felt. He was a visionary witness to our time; a superb artist who brought to his work unsurpassed integrity and a marvelous celebration of life. Henri's pictures have become icons and will continue to provide inspiration and enjoyment to millions. His lively presence will be deeply missed and we will all be less as a result of his absence. The staff and Trustees of ICP express their heartfelt condolences to Martine and Melanie and to their extended family and friends around the world. Cornell Capa, Founding Director Willis E. Hartshorn, Director International Center of Photography
