        LIVINGOOD-Clarence S., M.D. The Department of Dermatology of Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI, mourns the passing of our founding chairman on July 27, 1998 at the age of 86. He was the chairman between 1953 and 1976 & was the Executive Director of the American Board of Dermatology (ABD) between 1963 and 1992. Until his current illness, he remained active in affairs of the department, the institution and the ABD. He played a pivotal role in the development of dermatology as a specialty and made numerous contributions to our specialty at the national and international level. His love and knowledge of baseball were legendary. He was well loved and highly respected by colleagues, patients and friends. We offer our deepest condolences to his children, Bill, Louise, Susan, Beth and Larry and their families. Henry W. Lim, MD Chairman Edward A.
