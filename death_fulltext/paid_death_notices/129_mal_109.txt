        HIGHBLOOM-Sidney. The partners and staff of Hecht and Company note with deep sorrow the passing of Sidney Highbloom, who had been associated with the firm in various capacities for over 20 years. Sidney's pride in his work was matched by his great sense of humor and those who worked with him on a daily basis have suffered the loss of a friend. We extend our deepest sympathies to his family.
