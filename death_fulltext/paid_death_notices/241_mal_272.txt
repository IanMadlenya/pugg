        MILONI--Joseph T., native son of Brooklyn, 48, died on January 28, 2007. Joe was many things in his life: a bodybuilder and model; a disco fanatic (yes, he could do the hustle); a world traveler; a philhellene (look it up); a beach bum; a walking library of TV commercial jingles; Titanic-obsessed; a best friend to his dogs Chelsea, Cleo and Harley; a devoted son, loving partner and loyal friend; and both a cancer survivor and cancer victim. Joe is survived by far too many people to mention, but includes his mother and step-father, Ann and Ronald Katz, his brother and sister-in-law, Anthony and Cathy Miloni, his partner Michael Burke, his in-laws in the Burke family, and his scores of loyal friends. We will miss and remember you, Joe.
