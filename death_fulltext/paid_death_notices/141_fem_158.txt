        BLEVINS-Anne. We are saddened by the death of our longtime colleague Anne Blevins on October 5, 1998. Anne was first a nurse, then a microbiologist and finally, a hospital epidemiologist in a long and distinguished career at New York University, Columbia University, and the last 44 years at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was an active member and an awardee of the American Society of Microbiology and its New York City branch and a Fellow of the New York Academy of Sciences and the American Board of Microbiology. She was a life member of the American Public Health Association and the Soroptimist International Club of New York. She will be remembered by scores of nurses, microbiologists, epidemiologists, and the residents in medicine, surgery and pediatrics whom she helped train. Her dedication to patient care, education and research was an example for us all. Ms. Blevins is survived by cousins, Jacelyn Perrigo of Wisconsin, and DeeJay Weger and Todd Negel of New York. A memorial mass is scheduled for Thursday, October 22, 1998 at 3 P.M. to be held at Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121 Street. In lieu of flowers, please make contributions to Morningside Garden Retirement, 1 La Salle Street, New York, N.Y. 10027 or a charity of your choice.
