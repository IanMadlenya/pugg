        LEWIS-Claudia. With sadness, we wanted to let you know of the passing of Claudia Lewis this past Thursday-August 9th-at her home in Pennswood Village, PA. Claudia, who would have been 94 this fall, studied at Bank Street in the early 1930s and then joined the faculty of the graduate school, then known as the Cooperative School for Teachers. A contemporary of Charlotte Winsor and Barbara Biber, she played a critical role in the development of Bank Street and the principles we still hold today. We are still awaiting details from the family, but they have indicated that in keeping with Claudia's wishes, there will not be a memorial service.
