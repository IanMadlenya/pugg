        GORDON-Isidore. We were privileged to have this gentle man of Torah as our member during his last year, and we gratefully acknowledge the endowment in his memory, by his devoted children, Nahum & Barbara Gordon and Daniel & Beatty Gordon, of our taped Hashkafa Lecture Series which shall be called hereafter ''Gevurot Yitzchak''. We offer initially a tape of the inspirational Hespedim delivered at his Levayah to all who are interested, including those informed too late to attend. Cong.
