        BAR-ILLAN--David. It is with the most profound sadness that we mourn the loss of our dear friend. David Bar-Illan. He gave tirelessly to his friends and countrymen as an eloquent spokesman for Israel and the Jewish people. His artistic and intellectual talents improved the quality of life for us all. We will miss him deeply. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Beverly and his children Daniella, Jeremy and Kim. The Zises Family
