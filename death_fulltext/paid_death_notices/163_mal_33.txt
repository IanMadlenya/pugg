        ASANUMA-Hiroshi. The Rockefeller University community mourns, with deep sadness, the loss of our distinguished colleague and beloved friend, Hiroshi Asanuma. Dr. Asanuma was a pioneer in the study of how the brain controls muscle movement and the learning of motor skills. A valued member of the Rockefeller University community for more than twentyfive years, he will long be remembered for his contributions to the scientific understanding of the neurophysiology of movement as well as for his deep commitment to graduate education and his skill as a physician. Dr. Asanuma will be profoundly missed. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his family. Arnold J. Levine, President Richard Fisher, Chairman, Board of Trustees David Rockefeller, Hon. Chairman and Life Trustee, Board of Trustees
