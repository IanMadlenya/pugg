        MANTELL-May. 86, died peacefully December 28, while she slept. A perpetual teacher and student, fascinated by the world around her, her infinite curiosity and zest would always have made it seem too soon. Wife of the late Seymour Mantell, survived by her son Alan Mantell married to Laura Lewis Mantell, sister Dina Metraux, sister-in-law Jane Otten married to Alan Otten, six nieces and nephews and countless friends. At her request, no funeral is planned. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be sent to Planned Parenthood.
