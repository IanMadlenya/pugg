        REYNOLDS-William. The President of Wagner College, Norman Smith, along with the College's Trustees, note with profound sadness the death of William Reynolds, former president of Litton Industries International, on September 14th. A fellow trustee of the College and a member of its Executive Committee, he and his wife Margaret, also a trustee, last year gave the College a major gift toward its capital campaign. He was prized for his wise counsel and optimistic spirit. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Peggy, to his daughter Constance Bierkan and to his grandchildren Elizabeth and Laura.
