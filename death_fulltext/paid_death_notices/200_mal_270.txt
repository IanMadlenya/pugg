        MODIGLIANI--Franco. The administration, advisors, scholars and staff of The Levy Economics Institute of Bard College mourn the passing of Franco Modigliani, whose unparalleled brilliance in economic theory will forever work to advance and enrich the discipline. The Levy Institute was privileged to have him serve for many years on our Board of Advisors, where his wisdom, insight, and guidance proved invaluable. He will be sorely missed. Dimitri B. Papadimitriou, President The Levy Economics Institute of Bard College
