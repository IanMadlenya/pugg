        ALLEN-Doris, Ed.D. The Board of Directors and staff of the Jewish Community Center on the Palisades deeply mourn the loss of Doris Allen, who, prior to her recent retirment, served as Director of the JCC's Therapeutic Nursery. Dr. Allen was a beloved member of the JCC ''family,'' and we were indeed blessed to know her, a gentle and compassionate woman whose character, commitment, and leadership enriched all those whose lives she touched. We offer our deepest sympathy to Dr. Allen's family. Nancy I. Brown, President Avi A. Lewinson, Exec. Dir.
