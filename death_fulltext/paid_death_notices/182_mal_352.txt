        RUPERT-Rudolph. In loving memory of my son, Rudolph Emanuel Rupert: You always said I cannot spend one day without mentioning your name. Since March 23, 2001, the day you parted from us, every part of my heart still cries out for you and your name rings in my soul. To all of you who loved him, think of him today, because he loved you too!
