        JAFFE--Edwin. The Board and Staff of the Mahaiwe Performing Arts Center mourn the passing of Ed Jaffe and send our deepest sympathies to Lola Jaffe, his wife and our Founding President and Chair, and their family. Ed was a visionary and generous benefactor to numerous organizations in Berkshire County, MA, and we all feel fortunate to have known him and to have benefited from his wisdom and support. He will be greatly missed.
