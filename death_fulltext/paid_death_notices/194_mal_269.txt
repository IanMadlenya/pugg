        ADAMS-David E., noted vocal teacher and opera coach, passed away on March 9th, 2003 after a two-year struggle with kidney cancer. He was 61. For more than 30 years, he taught side-by-side with his wife Nancy in their studios in NYC and Great Barrington, MA. He was a master at the fine art of growing and sculpting beautiful voices for the demanding operatic repertoire and his students have performed in major opera houses worldwide. Beginning as a boy soprano in his hometown church in Georgia, he developed his musicianship at the piano as an organist and a choirmaster. He found his life focus when he fell in love with opera at the University of Georgia while earning his Bachelor of Music. He studied opera coaching at Indiana University, earned a Master of Music from the University of Kansas and studied art song, opera, languages and vocal repertoire at the Hochshule fur Musik in Cologne, Germany. He pursued doctoral studies and also taught voice at NYU and was twice invited to give master classes at the Royal Danish Opera. From 1996 to 1999 he was President of NYSTA (New York Singing Teachers Association). He is survived by his wife and partner of 40 years, Nancy Adams, his children, Lia and Charles, his sister, Carolyn, and brothers, Bob, Dick and Walter. His service will be held Friday, April 4th, at 1 PM, at the West End Collegiate Church, West End Ave. at West 77th in NYC. A memorial fund for NYSTA's Singing Competition has been established in his name.
