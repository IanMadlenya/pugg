        RABSTENEK -- Tom. The Nightingale-Bamford School Class of 2002 mourns the passing of Tom Rabstenek, father of our classmate, Christine. Tom was a generous and loving man whose commitment to education and to our community was active and selfless. A man of warmth and courage, Tom will be missed by all who knew him. We send our deepest sympathies to Christine, her brother Thomas, and her mother Diane.
