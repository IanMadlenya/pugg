        DUNCAN-Nathaniel Hammond, 14, of London, England and Chatham, Massachusetts, died Sunday at Children's Hospital in Washington, DC, almost a year after he was first diagnosed with a brain tumor. After initially receiving treatment in London, he had come to Washington in May. His parents, Jim and Laura Duncan, and his brother Sam were at his bedside when he died. Nat attended Emanuel School in Battersea. He was a junior counselor at Camp Monomoy on Cape Cod, and commuted between Washington and Cape Cod this summer to be able to attend camp while receiving treatment. Nat's principal interests included archery, real (court) tennis, theater and his Labrador retriever, Laddie. In addition to his parents and brother, Nat is survived by his grandfather, J. Bruce Duncan, and by aunts, uncles and cousins. Nat's funeral will be at 2 p.m. on Saturday, September 22, at St. Mark's Church in New Canaan, Connecticut. A memorial service will be held at St. Luke's Church in Battersea later this fall. Contributions in Nat's memory may be made to the Children's National Medical Center in Washington.
