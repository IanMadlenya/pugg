        $(6$)ROSEN--Rosalind. The Board of Directors of the Canavan Foundation mourns the untimely loss of Roz Rosen, a Founding Board member and past President. Her 14 year commitment to the Canavan Foundation will be long remembered. Roz was instrumental in organizing the Scientific/Medical Advisory Committee, handling the logistics of the early research grant programs, and working with National Tay-Sachs and Allied Diseases, Inc. to influence the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to recommend carrier screening for Canavan disease which was ultimately adopted by the organization. We extend our heartfelt condolences to her husband, Mort, her daughters, Emily and Jackie, and to her mother, Leona Poss. Lois Neufeld, President
