        LYONS-Edith. The Board, Council and staff of Planned Parenthood of New York City are deeply saddened by the death of Honorary Board member Mrs. Edith Lyons. Edith joined the PPNYC Board in the early 1960's, volunteered in our medical centers and served as the first president of the merged New York City affiliate from 1966 to 1971. Edith was an outstanding fundraiser and was herself a very generous supporter of our programs. We will long remember Edith forher half century commitment to this agency, and to the health and rights of women in New York City. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to her entire family. Cathy A. Cramer, Chair, PPNYC Board of Directors Joan Malin, President & CEO
