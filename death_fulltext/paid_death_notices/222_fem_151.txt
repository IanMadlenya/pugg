We, the Board and staff of the American Friends of the Israel Museum (AFIM) and of the Israel Museum (IMJ) mourn the death of our beloved friend and colleague, Shula Navon. For over 25 years, Shula was the heartbeat of the Israel Museum as she worked 16 hour days with Museum Founder, Mayor Teddy Kollek, and was awarded an Honorary Fellowship for dedicated service. Shula had a brilliant mind, boundless energy and a kind heart. We will miss her terribly and extend deep sympathies to Yoram, Frayda, Bob and the entire family.

We will miss your warm embrace and boundless energy. You fought until the very end. We will miss you terribly and will never forget you.
