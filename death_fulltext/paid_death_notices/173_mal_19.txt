        CHO-Jin. May 22, 2001. 24 years old. Everyone who knew Jin has been deeply affected by this tragic loss. He lived on the Upper East Side and worked as a real estate agent at Prince Properties LLC, while pursuing a degree in sociology. As a child, Jin emigrated from Korea to New York with his family. Jin was a loyal friend, colleague and dedicated son and brother. Jin had warmth and a passion for life. He will surely be missed by all who had the privilege of knowing him.
