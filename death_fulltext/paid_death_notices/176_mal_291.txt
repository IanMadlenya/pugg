        JACOBS-Aaron. Of Manhattan, 27 years old, was a European equities trader at Cantor Fitzgerald. He died September 11 in the senseless tragedy of the World Trade Center attack. His great enthusiasm for life expressed itself in sports, his many friendships and travel. He was the much loved younger brother of Joshua and son of Alice and Larry Jacobs of Newton, MA. He is survived by his fiancee Jeannine McAteer of Jersey City, his grandparents Alex and Harriet Katz of Phoenix. All will miss his sparkle and good sense.
