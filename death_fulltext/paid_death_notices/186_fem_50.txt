        BARBASH - Phyllis Susen. The Board and staff of Carnegie Hall mourn the death of Phyllis Susen Barbash, Director of Education at Carnegie Hall, 1994-2001. Phyllis led the educational work of Carnegie Hall to a level of activity and excellence unparalleled in its nonprofit history. She initiated music education programs that reached out to Head Start, nursery, elementary school children and families; led professional development of teachers; and spearheaded the drive to turn Carnegie Hall into a national forum for arts in education as expressed in music. Phyllis leaves behind thousands touched by her work, also as harpist with the Pittsburgh Symphony, Founder and Executive Director of the Three Rivers Young Peoples Orchestras, and Director of Education of The Philadelphia Orchestra. She leaves thousands more who knew her as a sparkling friend, and a person whose passion for, and faith in, arts education were inseparable from her personality. Her passion for the important things in life, her quick intelligence, vision and humor, and her ability to reach out to be a deeply understanding friend and colleague, were all rare qualities, and we will miss her deeply. Our condolences go to Steven, her gallant husband, her family, and to all those who benefited from her counsel, friendship, and inspiration. Sanford I. Weill, Chairman Robert J. Harth, Executive & Artistic Director
