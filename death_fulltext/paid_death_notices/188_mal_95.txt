        HAMPTON-Lionel. The New York Republican County Committee will greatly miss its treasured friend and longtime Vice Chairman, Lionel Hampton. For 40 years, we have been blessed by Lionel's charm, devotion, and irrepressible goodness. He brought enduring music into the hearts of all those he touched: ''And those musicians who shall play to you hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence.'' William Shakespeare.
