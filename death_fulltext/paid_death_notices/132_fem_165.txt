        KWOH-Emily T.Y. A woman of remarkable strength and imagination died on January 18, 1998. Her life was an array of triumphs and vicissitudes, the joining of east and west. Born and raised in China she came to the U.S. after the war in 1947. She received a graduate degree from Harvard in Psychology and went on to Columbia to prepare for a career in Early Childhood Education. Oddly, her career took a different path and Emily found herself as a pioneer in bringing the broad range of the Chinese cuisine to the U.S. with the great shanghai, Mandarin House and Mandarin East in the 50's and 60's. Her life was her family, friends, and dreams. She is survived by her children Bonny, Jesse and his wife Deborah, her grandchildren Carl and Catherine, her husband Ted, her brother Marcian and her sister Lydia. Remember and honor her. A memorial service is being planned.
