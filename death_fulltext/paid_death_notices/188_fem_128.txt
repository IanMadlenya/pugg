        WEINBERG - Hazel, M.D. Died September 17, 2002. The William Alanson White Psychoanalytic Institute and its graduates are deeply saddened by the loss of a beloved and devoted colleague who played an important role in the life of her many students and colleagues. Dr. Weinberg was a member of the Institute's Council of Fellows, Teaching Faculty, Training Committee and a Training and Supervising Analyst. She was also on the faculty of The New York Hospital Cornell Medical Center. Relied upon for her deeply caring understanding of others and for her ability to transcend intellectual conventions, she approached patients with an unfailing respect for their uniquely personal qualities. She was an especially caring and supportive colleague in times of need. A former dancer, her artist's investment in authenticity led her to be outspoken and direct-at times eschewing institutional process and circumstance - but her warmth and compassion were always present. For many years Hazel struggled with a variety of illnesses, truly bearing more than her share of tribulation, yet she was undaunted in her ability to carry on until the end. In that too, she was exemplary. We shall miss her deeply.
