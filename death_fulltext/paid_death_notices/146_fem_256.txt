        GADDIS-Jane. The members of the Waverly Block Association mourn the passing of our beloved friend and neighbor, Jane, on March 27. Jane was a unique figure in our community. She attended community meetings, planted a small garden in Washington Square Park, tended the tree beds along Waverly Place, and chatted with just about everyone who walked by. We will be forever grateful for her devotion to the Block Association and to the people and organizations of the Greenwich Village community. A memorial service will be held at a later date.
