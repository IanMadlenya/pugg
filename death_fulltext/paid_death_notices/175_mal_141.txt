        FLYER-Louis. Devoted husband to the late Ann Schapiro. Survived by daughter, Gladys, grandchildren Jeffrey, Kenneth, Elizabeth and his grandsons' wives, Susan and Harumi, great-grandchildren Jared and Emma Rose. Born in Russia in 1902, he came to New York in 1921, the last of eleven siblings to arrive in the U.S. Leaving behind extreme poverty, he ran his own jewelry company, Flyer Brothers, and became president of the Jewelers Association. A tireless worker for Israel, he was active in B'nai Brith and Hillel and helped found The Shul in Surfside, Florida, where he was at the center of activity for two decades. A dry wit, a careful eye, and a huge heart, he outlived his siblings and will be missed by his entire family. Services to be held on Thursday 10:30 AM at Boulevard Riverside in Hewlett, NY. (516-295-3100).
