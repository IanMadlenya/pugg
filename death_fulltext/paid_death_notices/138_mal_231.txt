        LEIR-Henry J. The Board of Trustees, the President, the Administration, and the Faculty and Staff of Clark University mourn the passing of their friend and supporter of many projects of mutual interest in Luxembourg. Through his generous support of CECIL (The Clark European Center in Luxembourg) Henry Leir enabled Clark faculty and students to study and teach in Luxembourg, the country which provided him with refuge from Nazi Germany in 1933 and the opportunities to become an international industrialist and philanthropist. The many Clark students and faculty who have been touched by Henry Leir's generousity and wisdom will always remember him and his special contribution to Clark University. Richard P. Traina, President Thomas Massey, Dean Walter Schatzberg, Professor and Director of CECIL
