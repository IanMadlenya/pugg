        LIFSHITZ-Eva. The Board of Directors, faculty, staff and entire student body, of 2000, at Associated Beth Rivkah Schools-Lubavitch extend sincere condolences to our devoted friend and supporter, Mr. Hyman Lifshitz upon the recent passing of his wife, Eva. Her pride in her heritage and devotion to Jewish traditions were her greatest attributes as a wife, mother and grandmother. A true personification of the biblical ''Woman of Valour'', Mrs. Lifshitz was privileged to raise an illustrious family, committed to worthy communal causes. In particular, she joined her husband in promoting the welfare of our Beth Rivkah educational network, and vitalizing its growth and progress. While her memory will live on in our halls of Torah learning, her presence in our midst will be missed. May our dear friend and patron, Mr. Lifshitz and his entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Rabbi Leima Minkowicz Executive Director Associated Beth Rivkah Schools 310 Crown Street Brooklyn, NY 11225
