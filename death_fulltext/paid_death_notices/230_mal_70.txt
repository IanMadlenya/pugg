        BISNOFF--Roy. Passed away peacefully in Boca Raton, FL, after a long struggle with emphysema, on March 4th, 2006. Beloved for his acerbic wit and self-depricating humor, Roy was a sought after companion for many devoted friends during his 76 years as a resident of New York and Florida. Roy and his late wife Elaine, who predeceased him in 1985, settled in Jericho, NY, and raised their two children, Susan (Julian), now of Florida and Kenneth (Michelle), now of California. Three beautiful granddaughters gave Roy tremendous joy: Emily (9), Isabella (9) and Jessica (2); he adored watching them grow and collecting their photos. Roy leaves behind his dear and only brother, Alvan (Claude) of Manhattan, and beloved brother-in-law, Burt Simon, of Brookville, LI, as well as his nieces and nephews: George, Julie, Lauren and Steven, all of New York. Roy, many may miss you, but we adored and loved you. May you truly rest in peace. Graveside services Wednesday, March 8th, 11 am, Old Montefiore Cemetery, Queens. In lieu of flowers the family would welcome donations to Schneider Children's Hospital, North Shore Long Island Jewish Medical Center; 516-465-2550.
