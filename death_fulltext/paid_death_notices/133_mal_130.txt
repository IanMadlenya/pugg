        BROWN-Raymond. The Officers, Board of Governors and Members of Elwood Country Club mourn the passing of its esteemed member Raymond Brown. Ray was a low key individual, whose view on life was that the glass was always half full. A truly warm man, Ray had only good things to say about people, a viewpoint on life that is unfortunately not shared by everyone. A member of Elwood for many years, Ray's presence will be missed. Our sincerest condolences to his wife Gerry and to his family. Lawrence Itkin, President
