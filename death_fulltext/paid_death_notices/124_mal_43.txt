        RACKMAN-Ruth. We extend our Kos Tanchumim to Rabbi Emanuel Rackman, Michael and Honey Rackman, Bennet and Ruth Rackman and Joseph and Elian Rackman, upon the loss of his beloved wife and their cherished mother and mother-in-law. May the family have loving memories of a wonderful wife and mother and may they be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
