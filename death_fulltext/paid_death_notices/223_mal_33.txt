        CORVINO--Alfredo. The entire Juilliard community deeply mourns the passing of Alfredo Corvino. A pillar of the Dance Division as a faculty member from 1953 to 1995, his artistry, professionalism, and integrity made him a beloved and deeply respected teacher and colleague. We extend our condolences to his entire family, and especially to his daughter, Andra Corvino, who is a current member of the Juilliard Dance faculty. Joseph W. Polisi, President Lawrence Rhodes, Director of the Dance Division
