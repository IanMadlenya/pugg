        GRUEN - Ernest. We deeply mourn the passing of our dear cousin Ernest. In his 95th year. We are eternally grateful to him for having rescued from certain death in the Holocaust no less than seven of our family members. For 32 years Ernest was associated with the Double-bass section of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra. Our heartfelt condolences to Gertrude, his wife of 63 years. Eva and Mark Firestone, Rennie and Cathy
