        MARTIN-Esmond Bradley, a graduate of Princeton and Columbia University, and the grandson of Henry Phipps, the Pittsburgh steel magnate and partner of Andrew Carnegie, died peacefully on Sunday, June 16, at the age of 87 at his family estate of ''Knole'' in Old Westbury, New York. Esmond Martin had an astonishing mind, alive with dynamism and originality that knew no horizons. Often a paradox, he was shy yet gracious and always a gentleman. His creative mind was interested in everything around him. He was a brilliant chess player, having been selected as a backup to Samuel Reshevsky in an international tournament. He was a discerning philatelist of long standing, a well-known orchid cultivator, with a patent on a species of his own creation, as well as a collector of fine pocket watches, books and English antique furniture. His magnificently restored estate and elegant gardens appeared in many feature films over the years and in the Smithsonian Institute. He was a very talented amateur lawn and court tennis player, having beaten the likes of Pierre Etchebaster, the then reigning 20 year world champion in court tennis, and even chalking up a 60 victory over Pancho Gonzales during a challenge match in the course of Gonzales' reign as world champion. For many years he was the world's fly-fishing record holder for Atlantic salmon that he landed on the Cascapedia River, Canada, in 1939. He excelled in many of his personal financial affairs, successfully wildcatting in gas and oil and other varied investments. Esmond Martin is survived by his twin brother, Alastair, his daughter, Serina Sanchez of Palm Beach, Florida, his two sons, Esmond, Jr. living in Kenya, and Peter, resident of the S.W. of France and five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. A funeral Mass will be celebrated Thursday, June 20th, at 10 A.M. at St. Brigid's Church, 50 Post Ave., Westbury. Attendees are invited to Knole for a repast.
