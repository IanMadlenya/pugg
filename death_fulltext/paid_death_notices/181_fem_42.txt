        MANDEL-Florence. Wife of Joseph C. Mandel, passed away Saturday, February 2, 2002. Until recent years when Alzheimers disease severly limited her activities, Florence participated with her husband in numerous philanthropies focused primarily in Cleveland, Florida and Israel. She was particularly devoted to the causes of health, social sciences and Jewish Education. As a young woman, she volunteered her time at Mt. Sinai Hospital and was an active member of Hadassah and ORT. Florence's illness along with Joseph's concern for others affected by Alzheimers, led to the establishment of the Joseph C. and Florence Mandel Alzheimers Care Giving Institute at Case Western Reserve University's Mandel School of Applied Sciences. In addition to her husband, Florence is survived by her two daughters Michele Beyer (Lawrence) and Penni Weinberg (Stephen), six grandchildren and five greatgrandchildren.
        MANDEL-Florence. As we all are arriving at the stage of life when there is time to savor our best memories, the passing of Flo Mandel reminds us of treasured dinners and travels to wonderful places with wonderful friends. We hope that Penny, Mickey and Joe will find comfort in their own memories of a great lady. Sylvia and Lewis Lubitz Sara and Mort Richter
