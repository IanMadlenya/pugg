        LIEF-Arthur. On April 10, 2002, at Franklin Hospital, at the age of 93. Devoted husband of the late Libbie Pollack Lief, dear father of Ruth (Irving) Malin, and Nancy Kelley (Burt) Hunter, proud grandfather of Mark (Rina) Malin, and John Reed Kelley, adored great grandfather of Andrew Scott, M. Charles, and Arthur James Malin. Survived also by brother Matthew (Jeanne) Lief, and brother-in-law Harold (Ruth) Pollack, nephew & faithful correspondent, Donald Lief, and many nieces. Something in his face made all who saw him, love him, including caregivers and health professionals during the last months of his life at Orzac Geriatric, where he fought very hard to recover from a fall and regained his strength, only to suffer a sudden reversal and decline. He gave away his big red Cadillac, stopped playing Scrabble, and just recently stopped tracking his stocks, but he still wore his yellow fishing hat on his trips to dialysis, and almost to his last day, picked winners at Aqueduct. He was the best friend a daughter could have had. Funeral service Friday 11:15 at Sinai Chapels, 162-05 Horace Harding Expressway, Fresh Meadows, New York.
