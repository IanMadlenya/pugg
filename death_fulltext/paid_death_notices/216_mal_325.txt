        CARSON--Johnny. The Friars Club mourns the loss of its esteemed Member, Johnny Carson. His passing leaves a void not only among the Friars, but also in the world of entertainment. For over 30 years he presided over late night television with wit, wisdom, and a comfortable charm that was welcomed into homes across America. The Friars are honored to have been recipients of this gifted raconteur's boundless humor. He was a formidable presence at Roasts and Dinners/a consummate performer who added a ribald sophistication to any event over which he presided. We gratefully acknowledge with heartfelt sympathy the rich legacy of humor and a treasure trove of memories that thankfully Johnny Carson has willed to all who love laughter.
