        BEDER--Eileen. Died on September 21 joining Abner, her love of 46 years on the second anniversary of his death. She began a career at Merrill Lynch, leaving to raise a family. Resuming her career, she became a certified financial advisor and, finally, a Vice President at Ryan Beck. Her true life's work, however, was as mother, sister, aunt, cousin, friend and grandmother. Her smile, warmth, generosity and love will be missed.
