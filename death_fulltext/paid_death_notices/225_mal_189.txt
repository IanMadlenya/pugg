        $(6$)LAUB--Joseph. We are saddened at the passing of the founder of Trail's End Camp, Joseph Laub. Over the 40 years that Mr. Laub served as owner and Director of Trail's End he touched the lives of countless campers and staff. Mr. Laub was a visionary in the summer camp industry, taking a 400 acre piece of land in Beach Lake, PA, and creating a haven where young people would come to make memories that would last a lifetime. Mr. Laub coined the phrase ''better for having been at Trail's End Camp.'' The staff and campers which he led over the years are a testament to this phrase. Together we thank him for the memories and express our heartfelt condolences to Mr. Laub's children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. The Goldberg and Honigfeld Families
