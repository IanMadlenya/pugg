        COLODNER-Patricia. The family of Gregory Colodner and Courtney Colodner Dallaire mourn the tragic loss of their stepmother, Patti. For their darling siblings, for Warren, whom we have known since he was 16, and for dear Grandma Sylvia, our hearts ache. We express our profound sorrow and extend our caring and concern for all. We know of Patti's loving pride for her children, so evident as we shared together a happy time just two days before the savage attack. All our prayers. Merrilee Colodner/The Messiano's
