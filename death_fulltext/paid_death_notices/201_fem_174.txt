        CHANOWITZ--Karen Olshan. No one knows better than I, the daily contributions Karen made to the company where we worked together for many years. She had an extraordinary intellect and a devotion to integrity that made her stand out in every respect. Karen spent no time dwelling on the challenges she faced; all of her time spent doing what she did best. We call that grace. I shall dearly miss my colleague and my friend. Bruce Meyers
