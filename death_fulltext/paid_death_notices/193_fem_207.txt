        SKYDELL-Dr. Ruth. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Rabbi Adrian Skydell on the loss of his beloved wife. An active and longtime member of the National Women's Division Board, Ruth was a special lady, whose kindness touched so many. A Golden Founder of the Medical Center, together with her husband, her modesty and acts of tzedekah were the hallmarks of her life. May Rabbi Skydell, Laurie, Bernard ''Buddy'', Harry, grandchildren and the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. American Committee for Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem
