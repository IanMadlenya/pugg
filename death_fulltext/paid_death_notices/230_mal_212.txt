        ALLOY - Herb. In sym pathy--The United Cerebral Palsy Association of Nassau County, Inc. deeply regrets the loss of a devoted Board member and tireless supporter of our agency, Herb Alloy. Mr. Alloy became actively involved with UCPN in 1959, joining the Board of Directors in 1977. The following year he was asked to serve as one of the Association's Vice Presidents, a position he held until 1991. Among Mr. Alloy's many achievements was the founding of the organization's Business & Industry Fundraising Campaign, which raised over $2 million under his Chairmanship. He was currently a member of the Executive Committee as well as Admissions & Discharge, Budget & Finance, and the Bayville Committees. Herb Alloy's 47 years of dedication and involvement have had a profound impact on the services provided to the children and adults with disabilities at UCPN, and his wisdom and guidance shall be sorely missed. We express our deepest sympathies to his wife, Natalie, and his family and friends. Thomas Connolly, President
