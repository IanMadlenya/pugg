        TIMPANARO -- Sylvester ''Timmy.'' March 1, 1933-November 13, 2004. It was never Sylvester, always just Timmy. To his family and his friends (he had hundreds of friends) always just Timmy. Everyone who knew and loved Timmy will miss him too much to explain. Over time empty places in our lives get filled in with daily obligations and the gentle sifting of time. But there will always be a place that can be filled with memories of Timmy. Just Timmy. Timmy was the son of Rose and Sylvester Timpanaro, Sr. He grew up in Astoria, Queens, joined the Army after high school and was a combat infantryman in the Korean war. Timmy found his life's work in the film production industry. He rose to become the head of the optical division at EUE Screen Gems. He then became president of TVC Productions and later was an executive VP and general manager at Rhinoceros Productions. After a distinguished career lasting 42 years, Timmy retired to his home in Amagansett, Long Island, in March of 2003. Timmy suffered sudden heart failure on November 13, in Amagansett. He is survived by his beloved wife Abby (nee Sheridan) and his cherished children, Denise Borgia, Patricia Riess, Cindy Connolly, Michael Timpanaro and James Timpanaro. He is also survived by his much loved older brother George. Timmy also leaves behind 14 grandchildren who were the joy of his life. Mass was held at 10 am, Wednesday, November 17, at Most Holy Trinity Church, East Hampton.
