        CARRUS-Gerald. The Columbia University Department of Surgery mourns the passing of Gerald Carrus, an outstanding philanthropist and friend. Soon after we established the Department's Surgical Science Division, Mr. Carrus and his wife, Janet, generously endowed the Gerald and Janet Carrus Professorship of Surgical Sciences and of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics in our Department. We are immensely grateful for the Carruses' recognition of the importance of basic research to the advancement of medical practice. Their benefaction will have a lasting impact on scientific and medical progress as we learn more about disease processes and apply this knowledge to patient care. We extend sincere condolences to Janet and the Carrus family. Eric A. Rose, M.D., Chairman Columbia University Department of Surgery Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center New York-Presbyterian Hospital
