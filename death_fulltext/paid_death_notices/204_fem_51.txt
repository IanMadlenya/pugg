        NYE--Shirley, on January 1, 2004, after a brief illness. Beloved wife of the late Edgar, she is survived by her son Richard, her grandchildren Timothy, Amy and Kate and her great-grandchildren Jack, Ted and Moppy. An expert collector of Chinese and Korean ceramics, devoted to her family and friends, she will be greatly missed. ''Thou art not gone being gone, where'er thou art thou leave'st in him thy watchful eyes, in him thy loving heart.'' In lieu of flowers contributions may be made to Lenox Hill Hospital. Interment is private. A memorial gathering will be scheduled at a future date.
