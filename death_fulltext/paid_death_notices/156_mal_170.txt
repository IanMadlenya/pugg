        KRENTS-Milton. The American Jewish Committee is deeply saddened by the death of Milton Krents, a beloved colleague whose career with AJC began in 1937 and spanned more than four decades. Milton served as Director of Radio and Television and, in 1969, established and directed AJC's William E. Wiener Oral History Library until his retirement in 1977, when his wife Irma became the Library's Coordinator. Milton remained as a consultant to the Library until 1986. A unique treasure under his loving guidance, the Library transcribed nearly 2000 memoirs, recording the 20th Century American Jewish experience through the recollections of those who had contributed, directly or indirectly, to the evolution of American Jewish life. In 1990, AJC donated the collection to the New York Public Library where it is housed in its Jewish Division. We send our heartfelt condolences to Irma, his children and grandchildren. David A. Harris, Exec. Director Shulamith Bahat, Assoc. Exec. Dir.
