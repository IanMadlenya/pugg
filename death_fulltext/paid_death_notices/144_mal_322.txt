        HARRISON-Bennett. The sudden loss of Bennett Harrison, Professor of Urban Political Economy at the Robert J. Milano Graduate School of New School University, is mourned by his many friends and colleagues. A generous human being with extraordinary powers to illuminate our world has been taken far too early. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Joan, his father Leo, and his sister Deborah Kuperman. M. Bryna Sanger, Acting Dean Robert J. Milano Graduate School Jonathan F. Fanton President, New School University
