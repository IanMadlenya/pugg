        CHUDNOW - Joseph. The American Friends of The Hebrew University (AFHU) and The Hebrew University of Jerusalem mourn the loss of Joseph Chudnow. Known for his devotion to Israel and to The Hebrew University, Joe was active in philanthropic activities on local & national levels. Joe fulfilled significant leadership roles within AFHU. He served as National Vice President and chaired the Board of the Wisconsin Chapter. In 1991 he received AFHU's highest honor, the Scopus Award. A Benefactor of The Hebrew University, he served on the International Board of Governors. He supported many university projects, including the Koret School of Veterinary Medicine and was made an Honorary Fellow of Hebrew University in 2001. We extend our deepest sympathies to Joe's beloved wife Marian, to their children, Donald, Yaffa and Debra and their families, including their six grandchildren. His extraordinary legacy will alway be remembered. American Friends of The Hebrew University Ira Lee Sorkin, President Keith L.
