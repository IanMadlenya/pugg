        BARUCH-Sulamita, M.D. The physicians and staff of QueensLong Island Medical Group, PC, are deeply saddened by the passing of our beloved former colleague and we extend our condolences to her family. Dr. Baruch was a distinguished and dedicated internist with our group for more than 16 years, who also served as the Director of Emergency Medicine at LaGuardia Hospital. Her work with us and later with Hospice Care Network reflected a life dedicated to healing and comforting others. We are honored to have known her.
