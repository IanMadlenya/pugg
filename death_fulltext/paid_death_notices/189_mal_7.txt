        KANAS-Stuart, Hazzan. The Cantors Assembly records with sorrow the passing of the revered colleague of over three decades. A wonderful Cantor, he quietly and gently served the spiritual needs of his congregations in New York and Florida. He served with dignity, warmth and care and his kindness, humanity and his davening inspired us all. We extend our sympathy to his wife Roz and his children. May his memory abide as a blessing. Hazzan Sheldon Levin, Pres. Hazzan Stephen J. Stein, Executive Vice President Hazzan Abraham B. Shapiro, Executive Administrator
