        DAVID--Else. We mourn the passing of an extraordinary woman of valor who devoted her life to the needs of the Jewish people worldwide. A Diamond Founder of the Hospital and a generous supporter of the Jesselson Heart Center and the Woman & Infant Center, she was a righteous woman who personified the highest qualities of dignity and elegance. She was a cherished friend who will be deeply missed. May the family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. American Committee for Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem
