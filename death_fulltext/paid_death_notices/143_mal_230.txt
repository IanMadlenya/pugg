        GADDIS-William. The faculty, Board of Trustees, and administration of Bard College mourn the passing of author and former faculty member William Gaddis. His novels made an inmeasurable contribution to american letters and his fine mind enriched the intellectual life of the college from 1976-1978. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his family.
