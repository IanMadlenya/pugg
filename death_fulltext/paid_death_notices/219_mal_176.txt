        OSTROW--Barnet. The officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Barnet Ostrow, whose legacy of support for the Jewish community continues through the benevolence of his family. We extend our deepest sympathies to Barnet's beloved wife, Annette; his son Ronald, and his wife, Batsheva; his granddaughter Alonna Ostad, and her husband, Michael; his in-laws, Shoshanna and David Wingate; and the entire family. Morris W. Offit, President Susan K. Stern, Chair of the Board John S. Ruskay, Exec. V.P. & C.E.O.
