        CRUZ-Eric. Died July 5, in NYC. All his friends and family mourn the passing of our beloved Eric, who gave so much unconditionally and warmly. We will always miss his sense of humor, style, kindness and his quaint, essential pursuit of bringing elegance and panache, not only to his life, but to all of those whose lives he touched. Eric, you waged a courageous battle with a lot of valor and dignity. May you rest in peace now. Your music will live forever.
