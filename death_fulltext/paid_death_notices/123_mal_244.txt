        FEDER-Henry, who owned and ran Joel's dress shop on Church Street in West Chester, Pennsylvania for more than 40 years, died on April 20, 1997 after a long and painful illness, at the home of his brother, Samuel L. Feder, M.D.,in Lenox, Massachusetts. He was 85. Joel's was a successful family business established more than 60 years ago by Joel and Anna Weiss, Feder's sister. After Feder's service in the military during World War II, he joined his sister in the store in 1947. He quickly fit in. His personal charm and exquisite taste won him a loyal following among fashion-conscious women of West Chester and neighboring communities. Feder was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the ninth of the 11 children of Max and Fanny Feder. After attending high school in Philadelphia, he went to Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. Early on he cultivated a taste in literature and particularly the theater, and he numbered many leading stage and screen figures among his close friends, frequently entertaining them at his West Chester home. Feder was among the first young men inducted into the Army in 1940 and he spent the next six years in the Pacific Theater, where he rose through the ranks to become a major. The friendships he forged in the Army stayed with him throughout his life. In 1956 he married Frances Rains (nee Propper) and embarked on the bon vivant style of life that became his hallmark. The couple traveled to all parts of the world year after year spending weeks exploring London or Paris, Venice or Madrid, Jerusalem or Cairo. On one of the trips they retraced the battlefield route he followed in the Pacific. Feder is survived by his wife, Frances, his stepdaughter, Jessica Rains, a granddaughter, Abigail Lentz, his sisters Sylvia Kohn and Mathilda Brailove and brothers Daniel and Samuel Feder.
