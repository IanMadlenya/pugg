        RAPEE-George N. Died peacefully April 1, 1999 in his Floral City, FL home at the age of 83. Beloved husband of Joellen Hall Rapee. Loving father of Christina Winkler. Proud, caring grandfather of James Governale and William Winkler, Jr. He retired to central Florida following a successful career in New York as a commercial real estate lawyer. George's two passions were his animals and playing bridge. He was a World Champion three times over, earning the highest possible rank, World Grandmaster. Funeral services will be private with a memorial service to be held in New York at a later date in May.
        RAPEE-George. To my dear friend of 37 years, my national championship bridge partner for the past 23 years, I cannot adequately express my sorrow or the emptiness in my life which comes with your death. To Jodi, Christina and the boys, my deepest sympathy at your loss. George, I will miss you very much. John Solodar
