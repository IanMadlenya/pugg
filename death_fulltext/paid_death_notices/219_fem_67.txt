        SCHULMAN--Gloria P. My lovely and loving wife died on April 9. During the course of our almost 50 year marriage, she gave me the space to become a man. Predeceased by son Jeffrey A. Schulman, M.D., she is survived by husband, Robert, most devoted daughter, Dana (son-in-law Richard), and her three grandchildren -- adored grandson Jeremy, and beautiful twin granddaughters, Halley and Julia. Also survived by sister, Linda and mother, Rose. This very special lady will be sorely missed, but her memory will live on in the faces of her three grandchildren. Services Sunday, 10 a.m., Plaza Funeral Home, 91 Street and Amsterdam, Manhattan.
