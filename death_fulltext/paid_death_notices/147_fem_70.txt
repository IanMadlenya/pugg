        PROUNIS-Monica. The Rye Country Day School, Class of 1980 expresses its deep sadness at the loss of our classmate, Monica Mittelstadt Prounis. Monica was a true class leader, an unusually bright and influential presence at our school. We will always remember her laughter and energy in the classroom, the hallways and on the playing fields. We extend our sympathies to Mr. and Mrs. Mittelstadt, Chuck, Simone, Othon, Alexa, and the rest of the Mittelstadt and Prounis families.
