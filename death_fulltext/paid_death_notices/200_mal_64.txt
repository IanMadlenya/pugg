        MESSNER -- Christopher G. On September 5, 2003 at age 44. Brother of Thomas and his wife Terry and Patricia and her husband Antonino Giresi. Godfather of Zachary Messner, uncle of Patrick and Matthew Sinclair and Antonino and Melissa Giresi. Chris never grew up (happily by the way) and despite years of earning his daily bread and Leberkase in the advertising business remained innocent, susceptible to few of the blandishments of the modern world. Friends may call at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Ave at 81 St, Sunday Sept 7, 2-5 and 7-9PM. Mass of Christian Burial Monday 10am, St Ignatius Loyola R.C. Church, Park Avenue at 84 St. Interment to follow.
