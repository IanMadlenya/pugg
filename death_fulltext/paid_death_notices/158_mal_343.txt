        DRILLMAN-Rabbi Solomon. Yeshiva University and its affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary mourn the passing of an eminent rosh yeshiva and Torah educator who was Eva, Morris, and Jack K. Rubin Memorial Professor of Rabbinics at RIETS. Warmly revered as scholar and mentor, the devoted alumnus was a distinguished faculty member and administrator-at our High School as well as RIETS--for over a half century. The University honored him for outstanding service to the Jewish community and higher education with our 1984 Rabbinic Alumnus Award. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Chaya; children, Rabbi Yaakov (and Sara) Drillman, Rabbi Yechiel (and Leah) Drillman, and Rabbi Yehoshua (and Nechama) Drillman; grandchildren; and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University David S. Gottesman, Chairman YU Board of Trustees Judah Feinerman, Chairman RIETS Board of Trustees
