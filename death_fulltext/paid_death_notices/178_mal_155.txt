        FISHER-Vincent J., MD. It is with deep sadness that we send condolences to the family of Dr. Vincent (Vince) Fisher. We extend our deepest sympathy to Natalie as she has lost her husband of 50 years, to his children Barbara, Maureen, Kevin, Brian, Theresa and Clairemarie they have lost their father and his many grandchildren, they have lost their grandfather. We the Members of the Department of Physiology and Neuroscience have lost a wonderful colleague and a gentle friend. As course director for the Physiology Course for many years, Vince injected humor and enthusiasm to a course that can be quite challenging for a first year medical student. He was an inspiring teacher, and a draconian defender of the role of physiological studies in the forging of physicians. We will miss him immensely. Dr. Rodolfo Llinas, Chairman All Faculty and Staff Members Department of Physiology / Neuroscience New York University School of Medicine
