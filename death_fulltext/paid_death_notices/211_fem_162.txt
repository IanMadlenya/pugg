        REMMER -- Patricia Cady. Passed away peacefully, surrounded by her family, on August 19, 2004. Pat was an incredible woman devoted to her family and friends. Known for her charm, enthusiasm and positive outlook, she exuded warmth to everyone who met her. Supportive and caring, independent and strong, Pat was somebody that you could always count on. Whether bird hunting with her husband Gene, playing bridge with her friend Al, skiing with her children, or camping in Tanzania with her grandchildren, Pat was always a great sport. She was born in South Bend, Indiana, on February 4, 1924, to Marcella and George Donahue. Educated on full scholarships to St. Agnes School in Albany and Barnard College in New York, she married Gene Remmer in 1945. An Old Greenwich resident for over forty years, Pat was tremendously active in community organizations as New York City Outward Bound Director, Columbia College Advisory Board Member, Barnard College Board Vice-Chairwoman, Chair of the Remmer Family Foundation and Trustee of Girls, Inc. of Jacksonville. After Gene's death in 1988 Pat served as Chair of EHR Investments. Pat is survived by her four children, their spouses and ten grandchildren, as well as her dear friend, Albert Lewis. Memorial services will be held at First Congregational Church, Old Greenwich, Connecticut, on Saturday, August 28, at 3 pm. In lieu of flowers, memorials may be made to the Patricia Cady Remmer Scholarship at Barnard College or the Vicars Landing Scholarship Fund.
