        PORTE-Sheldon H. The entire Nassau Association for the Help of Retarded Children family mourns the death of Sheldon H. Porte. A long time board member, Shelly, was always the first to volunteer to lend a hand. His warmth and good humor touched everyone around him. He was a strong advocate and true friend to all children and adults with developmental disabilities. He will be deeply missed at AHRC, where he has been a member for over 40 years. Our deepest sympathy to his wife Anne, his son and daughter-in-law Randall and Eileen, his daughter Janis, and all his family and friends. Jack Garofalo, President Michael Mascari, Exec Director Association for the Help of Retarded Children Nassau County Chapter
