        ROBBINS-Bernard. The Philharmonic-Symphony Society of New York, Inc., notes with sadness the death of Bernard Robbins, a valued member of the Orchestra's violin section from 1955 to 1983. In addition to his long tenure at the Philharmonic, Mr. Robbins performed with the NBC Symphony under Toscanini and with the Stradivarius String Quartet, the NBC String Quartet and the Canadian Quartet. His legacy of high standards and deep regard for his colleagues will long enrich our lives. We extend our sincere condolences to his family, including his wife, Libby, and their children.
