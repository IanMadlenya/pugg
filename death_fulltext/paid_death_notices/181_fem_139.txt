        SCLOVE-Louise Herzog. Died in Amherst at 92. Formerly of NYC and Westport CT. Died February 8 in the Center for Extended Care in Amherst, MA. Born February 3, 1910 in New Rochelle, NY, she was the daughter of the late Joseph L. and Eleanor (Guiterman) Herzog. Louise Sclove graduated from Wellesley College, class of 1931, where she formed lifelong friendships, and earned a graduate teaching certificate from Bank Street College of Education in New York City. During her varied professional life, Mrs. Sclove worked as a nursery school teacher, designer of retail displays for children's toys, public opinion poll administrator, mutual fund salesperson, publisher of a professional psychology journal, publicist, public education advocate, Jewish oral historian, and enthusiastic community and social activist. She enjoyed outdoor activities ranging from downhill skiing, for which she was an East Coast Pioneer, to tennis, golf, sailing, ice skating, hiking and camping, as well as international travel, chess and bridge. She read continuously. She continued cross-country skiing, swimming, skating (and unfortunately driving) into her eighties. She was fascinated by children, the younger the better. Her cute sense of humor stayed with her to the end. Her husband, Abraham Bernard Sclove, died in 1954. She is survived by her sons Richard E. Sclove of Amherst and Edward M. Dreyfus of Mar del Plata, Argentina and by four grandchildren. A private memorial service will be held in Amherst for family, friends, and her devoted following of younger people whom she counseled, supported and loved.
