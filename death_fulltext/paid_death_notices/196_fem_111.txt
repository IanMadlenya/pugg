        PERGAMENT - Irene. The Tel Aviv Foundation expresses profound sorrow to the Pergament family on the passing of Irene-a tremendous loss. She was a valiant and elegant woman. The Irene and Murray Pergament Writers House and Gutman Museum in Neve Tzedek donated in memory of their daughter Sherri P. Koeppel would not have been possible without their generosity. It is a landmark in the city-full of life and energy-and their legacy. The Tel Aviv Foundation, Ron Huldai, Mayor of Tel Aviv-Yafo Admiral (res) Abraham BenShoshan, Director General Geannie Gerzon, Executive Director, American Committee
        PERGAMENT-Irene. Solomon Schechter Day School of Nassau County mourns the passing of our devoted benefactor Irene Pergament who, with her late husband Murray, were committed not only to our school but to numerous Jewish institutions. Without them, our community has now been greatly diminished.
