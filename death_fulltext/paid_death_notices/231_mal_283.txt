        $(6$)KAUFMAN--Edward G. The NYU community mourns the death of its friend of many decades, Edward Kaufman, a graduate of our College of Dentistry in 1943 who went on to become a faculty member and then serve as dean from 1985 to 1998. He was dedicated to NYU and to the profession of dentistry. He was a model dean, a builder of facilities and programs. Dean Kaufman was beloved by the Dental College community, and especially its alumni/ae. His absence will be keenly felt, and we offer our deepest sympathies to his family.
