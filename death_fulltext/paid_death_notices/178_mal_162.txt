        LUDWIG-William Frank. Died November 8, 2001 in Vero Beach, Florida from complications of lung cancer. Loving husband of Gaye, devoted father of Bill, Amelia, Jack and Julia, beloved grandfather of Stacey, Lydia, Anna and Zachary and brother of Judy and Donald. Friend and colleague to many as Vice President at JP Morgan and partner at Morgan Lewis G&A. Born February 2, 1930 in Sanford, Florida, Bill graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1951, and Columbia Law School in 1958, after military service as an officer in the US Naval Reserve. Bill began a 26-year career at JP Morgan & Co. in 1958, first as legal counsel, then as Vice President serving the banking needs of many of America's largest companies. Bill interrupted his career at Morgan in the mid 1960s, heeding the call of John F. Kennedy for public service. He led the Latin American Lending Division of the US Agency for International Development. Bill was the first head of the workout department of Morgan in the 1970s and was named a director of Penn Central when that company emerged from bankruptcy. In the mid-1980s he created and led the bank's leveraged buyout activities. Bill's vigorous independence of mind, pragmatic approach to business and ability to find humor in almost any situation impressed all with whom he came in contact. From long standing business relationships grew many fast friendships. At the suggestion of a bank colleague, Bill met his second wife, Gaye McIntosh, just over 20 years ago. In 1986, Bill left JP Morgan to become partner in the leveraged buyout firm of Morgan Lewis G&A. After 7 years of creative and successful deal making, Bill and his family moved to Vero Beach, Florida to be close to his Florida roots. A memorial service was held Saturday, November 10th at his home in Vero Beach. Contributions in Bill's memory can be sent to the University of Pennsylvania's Penn Fund.
