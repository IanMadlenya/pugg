        ALEXANDER-Diane Davenport. Died peacefully November 17, 1999, at Longboat Key, Florida; age 74. Formerly a resident of Westport, Connecticut. Beloved wife of Charles J. Alexander, Jr., loving mother of Lauren Helmetag of Brooklyn Heights, New York, Leslie Luhring of Brooklyn Heights, Charles J. Alexander III of North Miami, Florida, and Sara Jane Henderson, of Fairfield, Connecticut. Adored grandmother of Max Alexander Helmetag, Alexander Lawrence Luhring, Peter Charles Henderson and Kyle Alexander Henderson. Also survived by many cousins, all grandchildren of the late W. L. Smith and Anne Elizabeth Barlow Smith, of East Liverpool, Ohio. Dede was the daughter of the late Edmund and Sarah (''Sal'') Davenport of New Canaan, Connecticut. She was a graduate of Rosemary Hall School, and in 1948 received a degree of Bachelor of Fine Arts from Yale University. She was an accomplished, devoted artist; at an early age, her ''miniaturistic dexterity'' was acclaimed in a New Yorker review of young artists' work. She was listed in Who's Who in American Art, and was a member of the National Association of Women Artists, the Silvermine (CT) Guild of Artists and Longboat Key Art Center. Dede's blithe spirit, bright wit and thoughtful caring for her family and legion of friends will be missed, but remembered joyously, by all who knew her. A memorial service will be announced later.
