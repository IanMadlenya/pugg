        GOLDMAN--Robert. With deep sadness, we regret the loss of our cousin, Robert Goldman. To those who knew him, he was a creative and successful businessman, a lover of sports and a fierce but fair competitor in all areas of life. He was a loving husband to his wife, Frieda, a proud father to his sons, David (Mitchi), Danny (Julie) and Michael (Charlotte) and adored grandfather to Sam, Sarah and Max. We will all miss his optimism, sense of humor, generosity and wonderful intelligence. Joann, Noel, and Zeke Eisenberg
