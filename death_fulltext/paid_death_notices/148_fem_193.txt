        THURNAUER-Maria. The Board of Directors, staff and music school students of the Jewish Community Center on the Palisades deeply mourn the loss of Maria Thurnauer who dedicated her life to supporting music and the arts. Maria and her husband William endowed the JCC Thurnauer School of Music, and their continued dedication to the life and growth of this school has been immeasurable. All at the JCC are indeed blessed to have known Maria, whose memory will remain with us reflected in her beautiful photographs which grace the halls of the Center. We offer our deepest sympathy to William, son Andrew, daughter Joan and the entire Thurnauer family. May the Lord comfort them among all the mourners of Zion. Edward A. Grossmann, President Avi A. Lewinson, Exec. Director
