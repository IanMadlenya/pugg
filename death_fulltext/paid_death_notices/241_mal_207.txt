        ZIPPER--Jacob, on February 5, 2007, in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Born April 29, 1910, in Zaboike, Galicia (Ukraine). Chazzan and rabbi of Congregation Ahavas Israel in Greenpoint from 1949 to 2007. Already as a young man, his wonderful voice earned him the title of Angel of Tarnopol. Having survived WWII fighting in the Polish Army, Jacob and his wife, Rifcia, settled in Greenpoint in 1949. He assembled a wide circle of friends and admirers that included Chassidim, Polish immigrants and many new arrivals to North Brooklyn. Thanks to his spirit, Congregation Ahavas Israel remains ready to serve Jews of all denominations. He is survived by nieces Rozia Hirsch and Rosalyn Suchow, greatnephews Eddy and Leon Friedfeld and Joseph Hirsch, great-niece Helene HirschWingens, and his caretaker for over 20 years, Irena Lefanowicz. He is reunited with his beloved Rifcia and has forever joined the choir of the angels. May his memory be a blessing for all. In lieu of flowers please consider a donation to Congregation Ahavas Israel, P.O. Box 32, Brooklyn, NY 11122-0032.
