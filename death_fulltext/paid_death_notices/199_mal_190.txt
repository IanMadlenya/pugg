        McNELIS--Edward, 72. New York University Department of Chemistry mourns the passing of our beloved colleague Edward McNelis, professor of chemistry and former department chair. An active scholar and devoted teacher, he served NYU for 36 years, making numerous contributions to the field of organic chemistry. Our heartfelt sympathies go to his wife, Katrina, his sons, John and Joseph and the entire McNelis family.
