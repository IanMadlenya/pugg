        STERN-Chaim. The clergy, staff and members of Temple Beth El of Northern Westchester are profoundly saddened by the untimely death of our Rabbi Emeritus, Chaim Stern. As our Senior Rabbi for thirty-three years, he will be remembered with great fondness for his wisdom, humor, and influence on our Reform Movement as its foremost poet and liturgist. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his beloved wife, Lea, his sons, David, Philip, and Michael, and his stepsons, Rand and Cary Lane. A Memorial Service will be held at Temple Beth El, 220 South Bedford Road, Chappaqua, NY, on Sunday November 11, 2001 at 2 P.M. May his memory be for a blessing. Alan D. Fuchs, Rabbi Dana S. Anesi, Cantor Stephen Adler, President
