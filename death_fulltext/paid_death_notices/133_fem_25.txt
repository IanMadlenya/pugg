        COTTERELL-Viola L. The firm of Cotterell, Mitchell & Fifer deeply mourns the passing of Viola L. Cotterell, the widow of our founder, Wesley Cotterell. On January 30, Mrs. Cotterell, died after a short illness in her 99th year. Until her last few weeks, Mrs. Cotterell lived unassisted in her longtime home in Garden City. In ways large and small, Mrs. Cotterell contributed to the success of this firm and maintained a lively interest in its progress until her death. With her husband, she shared a lifelong devotion to the promotion and strengthening of Colgate University, and her beloved ''DKE's'', Mr. Cotterell's fraternity. Of petite natural stature, her guileless character loomed like a giant to all who knew her. A memorial service is planned for the spring at Colgate University.
