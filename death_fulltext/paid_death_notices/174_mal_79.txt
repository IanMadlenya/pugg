        FLAHERTY-Kevin F. This warm, witty, charitable and well respected young man died July 3, age 45, of cancer. His too brief career included work as a soloist at St. Bartholomew's Church, arranging speaking engagements for wellknown political and theatrical personalities as a partner with New York Speakers Bureau, Inc., and as an attorney for the law firm of Gibbons, Del Deo, et al. Kevin leaves behind two brothers, Tim and Mike Flaherty, a sister, Sue Huggans, and his companion of ten years, Greg Grimes, who will miss him greatly, as will many friends. A memorial service will be held Wednesday, July 11th, at 7:30 PM, First Presbyterian Church on Fifth Avenue, between 11th and 12th Streets. Grimes and Flaherty family
