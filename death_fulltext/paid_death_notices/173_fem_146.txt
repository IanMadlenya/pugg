        KAHN-Ruth. Age 75. Beloved mother and grandmother, community leader and neighborhood activist, distinguished psychiatric social worker and advocate for human services. She raised two daughters as a single mother after the early death of her cherished husband Dr. Seymour Lion Kahn, and was a tireless advocate for social and political causes.

Daughter of the late Louis and Rachel Lesselroth, she is survived by her daughter Karen and son-in-law William Baskett of Northampton, England, daughter Janice and grandchildren Jill and Robb of Chestnut Hill, MA. Contributions may be sent to the New York Foundation for Senior Citizens, or Volunteers of America of Greater New York. Memorial service, July 22, 4-6 PM, at Holland House, 351 West 42nd Street.
