        KARAGHEUSIAN - Leila. Union Settlement's Board of Directors and staff mourn the passing of Leila Karagheusian, who served as a Director from 1924 to 1995 and as an Honorary Director for the balance of her life. She was a graduate of Barnard College and Columbia University School of Social Work. As a lifelong resident of Manhattan, she cared deeply about the quality of life in the city and dedicated her time and resources to the East Harlem community. In the '20's she worked as a volunteer in the Union Settlement Thrift Shop. She was instrumental in securing a major gift for the construction of the agency's Leggett Day Care Center. She had a tender heart and a valiant spirit. She was selfless, thoughtful and generous.
