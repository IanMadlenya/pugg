        KONER-Pauline. The Juilliard School mourns the passing of Pauline Koner, dance faculty member from 1986 to 1999. She was an extraordinarily powerful performer who could hold the stage with both bold movement and subtle gesture. Although her stage career ended many years ago, she generously shared her profound understanding of the elements of dance performance with her students. She will be deeply missed.
