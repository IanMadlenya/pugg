        MARX-Dorothy (Sachs), 79, peacefully on January 30, 2001. after a courageous, high-spirited struggle with illness for five years. She was the glowing center and the welcoming heart for all who knew and loved her. We grieve her loss as we are inspired by her all-caring love, her exquisite taste and style, and her insistence on recognizing the goodness in everyone she knew: Herbert L. Marx, Jr., husband; Tedra Schneider, daughter; Michael Levine, son; Ellen Levine, daughter-in-law; Violet Lapides and Eva Marcus, sisters. She is also survived by step-children Jonathan Marx, Timothy and Nan Marx, and Alison Marx; grandchildren and step-grandchildren Gregory, Andrew and Hilary Schneider; Benjamin and Samuel Levine; Victoria and Robert Frank; Alyssa, Ariel, Benjamin and Sophie Marx; and three generations of nieces and nephews who adored their ''Auntie Mame''. Dorothy was a graduate of New York University. She served as Personnel Director of Nytronics, Inc. and Personnel Manager for the national office of Hadassah. Later, she became the active proprietor of Dorothy Marx Art and Antiques Acquisitions. She was formerly married to Maurice Levine.
