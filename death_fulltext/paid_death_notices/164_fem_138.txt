        TUROBINER-Alice. Ohr Torah Stone Institutions of Israel records with great sorrow the untimely passing of Alice Turobiner, a most beautiful, elegant, generous and sensitive benefactor of our people. The students of Midreshet Lindenbaum in Jerusalem will forever be grateful for the Auditorium which Alice and her beloved and caring husband Harold dedicated last year. May the Almighty comfort the entire family among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Rabbi Shlomo Riskin Chancellor
