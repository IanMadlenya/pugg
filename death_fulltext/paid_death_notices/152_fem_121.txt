        KARAGHEUSIAN-Leila. The Columbia University School of Social Work notes, with deep sadness, the passing of Leila Karagheusian, a 1944 graduate who was an extremely supportive friend and benefactor of the School for many years. Miss Karagheusian established scholarship funds at the School in memory of her parents, Miran and Zabelle, which have provided much needed financial aid to our students for more than three decades. Columbia students will continue to benefit from her vision and generosity far into the future. Miss Karagheusian's tireless and long standing dedication, especially to the less fortunate among us, will be greatly missed now and in years to come. Ronald A. Feldman, Dean Columbia U Schl Social Work
