The Center for Modern Psychoanalytic Studies, its Board of Directors, faculty, and students mourn with deep sadness and loss the passing of Dr. Benjamin Margolis, a founder of the Center for Modern Psychoanalytic Studies, a member of its Board of Directors, and an active faculty member until his death. He inspired all those he taught and supervised. A pioneer in efforts to advance psychoanalysis as a discipline for all individuals, regardless of academic background, he wrote extensively on the theory and technique of Modern Psychoanalytic principles and was a master teacher. We as a community extend our deepest condolences to his wife Deborah and his daughter Helen Michael and her family.
