        SCHWAB--Terrance W. Died April 25 in his wife's arms after a short, sudden illness, comforted in his last days by his wife Eileen, his children Matthew, Kate and Claire, Matthew's wife Johanna, Kate's husband Paul Welykoridko, and Claire's boyfriend Stephen Vogel. Also surviving him is his spectacular, much loved granddaughter Ainsley Welykoridko. He was a good man and will be sorely missed. A memorial service will be held at 10 am, on Wednesday, April 28, at the Church of the Ascension, 221 West 107th St. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that contributions be made in Terry's memory to Caramoor, 149 Girdle Ridge Rd, Katonah, NY 10536.
