        BLOOMFIELD-Bernard M. The Officers and Board of Directors of the West Point Jewish Chapel Fund are greatly saddened by the loss of their dear friend and supporter, Bernard M. Bloomfield, a great American and a great patriot. Bernard was an early and ardent supporter of our Chapel at West Point, contributing many valuable pieces of Jewish antiquity, all of which greatly enhanced the beauty of the Chapel. We will be eternally grateful to him for his friendship and support. Our condolences to his lovely wife Vera. Herbert M. Ames, Chairman Louis Gross, President West Point Jewish Chapel Fund
