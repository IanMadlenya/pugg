        THOMPSON -- Hugh Smith. Named for an uncle who was killed in aerial combat in the waning days of World War I, and with the same name as his great grandfather, governor of South Carolina in the 1880's, Hugh was born on June 8, 1924 and grew up in Larchmont, NY. After attending Exeter, he served in the U.S. Army including two years in Hawaii as a sergeant in the Signal Corps. Hugh matriculated at Yale University where he majored in English, Art History and languages. In his junior year at Yale, he studied at the Sorbonne where he perfected his language studies particularly French. On his return to New York, he worked for Wood and Hogan, a well known antique furniture firm where he specialized in antique British furniture and made frequent trips to England. In the 1970's he purchased an historic Victorian mansion in Sag Harbor, Long Island and spent several years restoring it into his home which was filled with antiques. In 2003, Hugh moved to the health care unit of Peconic Landing in Greenport, Long Island where he died on July 24, 2006. He is survived by his younger brother, William Glasgow Thompson of Greenport and a first cousin, John Means Thompson of Phippsburg, Maine. A memorial service will be held at St. Ann's Episcopal Church on Friday, August 25, at 11 A.M. In lieu of flowers, contributions in Hugh's honor may be made to St. Ann's Episcopal Church, P.O.
