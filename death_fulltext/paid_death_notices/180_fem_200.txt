        SCHNEIDER-Leah. The Board of Directors and staff of the Manhattan Valley Development Corporation and Manhattan Valley Management Company Inc. mourn the recent passing of Ms. Schneider, long our Executive Director, inspirational leader and board Member. Over the past thirty years, Leah's deeds have been manifested by the revitalization of the Manhattan Valley section of the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Her vision and determination transformed a deteriorating predominately low-income neighborhood into a paragon of affordable Housing development and community preservation, which attracted visitors and researchers from across the seas and our country. The community she rebuilt will sorely miss her leadership, kindness and wisdom. Mildred Dweck, President of MVDC Board Donna-Marie Gibbons, Executive Director, MVDC Jose Valerio, Executive Director, MVMC
