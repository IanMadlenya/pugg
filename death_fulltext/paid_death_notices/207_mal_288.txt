        VISCARDI--Henry, Jr. With the deepest sadness we mourn the passing of a champion in the field of rehabilitation medicine. In the halls of Congress and the New York Legislature he forcefully articulated the needs of the disabled worker for vocational training and for a special model school for the physcially disabled child. Together with Dr. Rusk they laid the groundwork for rehabilitation medicine--the restoration of individuals to their maximum capacity. To my mentor, colleague, friend, and a faculty member for over 50 years-our gratitude. To Lucile, his devoted wife, and family-we share your loss deeply. Amici Nunc et Semper.
