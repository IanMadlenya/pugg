        AHERNE-Eleanor de Liagre. 90, died at home after a short illness in Boca Grande, FL. Wife of the late film and stage actor Brian Aherne and sister of producer Alfred de Liagre, Jr. She is survived by her daughter Leonie Labrot Gately of Annapolis, MD. Five grandsons and six greatgrandchildren. An unusual lifetime network of great close and diverse friendships-spanning the early arts colony in Woodstock, NY to Hollywood and from New York City to Europe. She will always be celebrated and loved for her warmth, immense charm, her sense of fun and almost total and complete eccentricity. The laughter and great good nature will live on. Memorial Services will be held in January in Boca Grande, FL.
