        REUBHAUSEN -- Oscar M. The Association of the Bar of the City of New York mourns the passing of Oscar M. Reubhausen, President of the Association, 1980-82. An outstanding lawyer, he was devoted to the Association, overseeing its reorganization and building renovation. Oscar was dedicated to what he saw as the lawyer's role as an architect of society, helping to shape public policy in the sciences and many other fields. We were honored to have the benefit of Oscar's leadership for so many years.
