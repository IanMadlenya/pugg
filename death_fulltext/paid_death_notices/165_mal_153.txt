        NEEDLEMAN-Max, MD. The entire Beth Israel Medical Center family joins with the physicians and staff in the Department of Psychiatry in acknowledging with sadness the passing of our dear friend and beloved colleague, Max Needleman, M.D. Beginning with his residency in 1935, Dr. Needleman served with great distinction as a member of our medical staff for more than 55 years, including tenure as Director of Psychiatry. He established the hospital's first psychiatric inpatient unit and will forever be remembered as an outstanding clinician and teacher. He also was a longtime member of the Beth Israel Medical Board and the Doctors Alumni Association, and was a recipient of the Alumnus of the Year Award. In recognition of his outstanding career, the Psychiatry Department established in 1984 the Max Needleman, M.D. Award for teaching excellence. To his son, Dr. Jack Needleman, his family and friends, we extend our heartfelt condolences. Morton P. Hyman, Chairman, Board of Trustees Matthew E. Fink, MD, President and CEO Henry S. Singman, MD, President, Medical Board Arnold Winston, MD Chairman, Dept. of Psychiatry Robert L. Salant, MD, President, Doctors Alumni Assoc.
