        CARTER-Pauline. Mom, life without you to talk to, and reminisce with, is unimaginable. You brought unbridled joy into my life. Your sense of humor ensured that every phone call and visit was filled with happiness. Your loving and sweet voice will be heard forever. The fullness of your life could be measured by the simple things that brought you pleasure: talking with your children and grandchildren. Knowing that you are happy is my sole comfort at this sad time. I will always think of you and remember your smile, your hugs and kisses, your exuberance, and your belief in me. You always said that you were my best audience. You are finally with Dad once again-the heavens will reverberate with the two of you trading stories! Rest in peace. With all the love in the world, Donny.
