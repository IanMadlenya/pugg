        $(6$)NATHAN--Evelyn. You were one of a kind, glamorous and beautiful. My happiest childhood memories include times shared, playing innocently and endlessly, with Terry in your gracious house. Thank you ''Aunt'' Evelyn for those warm and loving memories, but most of all, for sharing your treasured daughter, Terry, my most wise, fun and wonderful best friend of the past 55 years. With love, Jill Weinick Iscol
