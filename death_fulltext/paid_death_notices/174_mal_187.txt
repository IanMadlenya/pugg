        MAIT-Julius. We mourn the loss of our first cousin Jules who was more like our brother. Jules celebrated life every day. He shared joyfully with Doris for 62 years, with his three sons and daughters-in-law, his two sisters, his eight grandchildren and two greatgrandchildren, and with each person who knew and adored him as we did.
