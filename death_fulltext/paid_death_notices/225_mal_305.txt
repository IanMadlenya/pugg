        WHITE--Don. On behalf of the Board of Trustees, staff and volunteers of Thirteen/ WNET New York, we express our deep sadness at the passing of our longtime colleague Don White, manager of financial planning and analysis. A kind and thoughtful man, Don could be counted on to conduct his professional duties with a unique personal touch. He was a good listener always brimming with encouraging words. We will remember Don as a gentleman with many interests, and as a considerate co-worker who took great pleasure in his brisk daily walks and volunteer activities. He will always be missed by those fortunate enough to have known him. Our heartfelt condolences are with his family. Steven Rattner Chairman William F. Baker President
