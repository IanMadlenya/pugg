        KING--James. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of the distinguished dramatic tenor, James King, a beloved artist and friend. He made his Met debut in 1966 as a noble Florestan in ''Fidelio'' and holds the record for most Met performances of two of the most challenging roles in the tenor repertory, Bacchus in ''Ariadne auf Naxos'' and the Emperor in ''Die Frau ohne Schatten'' which he sang in the work's company premier. His repertoire with us also included works by Puccini, Wagner, Berg, Bizet, and Britten. We extend our deepest sympathy to his family and friends. Joseph Volpe, Gen'l Manager James Levine, Music Dir
