        PALEN-David S. It is with the greatest sorrow and regret that we note the death of David S. Palen, a Managing Director of The Chase Manhattan Bank and our Senior Country Officer for Korea. David died tragically September 30, 1997 in a car accident in Poland, along with a fellow Chase Officer, K.Y. Lee, a Vice President and head of Chase's Korea Desk in London. David had been our dear friend and loyal colleague since joining the bank in 1981. We will miss him. Our expressions of heartfelt sympathy go to David's wife, Betty, and his three children. We will remember David at a memorial service on Friday, October 17, at 1 PM, at St. Bartholomew's Church, Park Avenue and 50th Street, New York City. In Lieu of flowers contributions may be made to the Palen-Lee Education Fund, which has been established to benefit the children. Contributions may be sent to Julian Bub, US Trust Administration, The Chase Manhattan Bank, 1211 Avenue of The Americas, 34th Floor, New York, New York, 10036.
