        GELLMAN--Charles. Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA) mourns the passing of Charles Gellman, former GNYHA Chairman and a true legend in the annals of New York health care management. From a champion boxer in his youth to a champion of Jewish Memorial Hospital to, in his retirement, a champion for the needs of former boxers, Charles was always charismatic, compassionate, and deeply committed. He was a one-of-a-kind person who helped shape New York's health care system. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Ruth and the entire Gellman family. Kenneth E. Raske President, GNYHA
