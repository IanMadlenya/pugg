        BROWN-Earle. Earle Brown was not only one of our great composers but an outstanding leader in the new music community. As a conductor, musical thinker, and as former president of the Board of the American Music Center, Earle Brown's contributions to the field will continue to resonate with everyone whom he has touched. And through his wonderful music, he will continue to inspire all of us. Our sympathies to his wife, Susan Sollins, sister, Marilyn Krysil, and the entire family. Earle was a superbly generous human being and we will miss him dearly. The American Music Center
