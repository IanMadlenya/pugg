        POPKIN-Henry. Died peacefully at his home in Brooklyn on Thursday, October 24. He was born in Providence, R.I. on April 20, 1924. During his long writing career he contributed to the N.Y. Times, the Times of London, the Financial Times, and many other publications, writing about his passion, the theatre. For nearly 30 years he was a professor of English at SUNY Buffalo. Early in the life of the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis he was its dramaturge. Henry will be sorely missed by his wife, Judy, and his daughter, Sarah. They will remember him as a man of simple tastes, rigorous thought, and a deep love of the theatre and his family. Services will be held on Friday today at 12 noon at the Weinstein Garlick Kirschenbaum Chapels, 1153 Coney Island Avenue, Brooklyn, N.Y.
