        MEYERSON--Martin. The Board of Directors and staff of the Monell Chemical Senses Center mourn the death of Martin Meyerson, Chairman of the Board. He will be greatly missed. A longterm supporter and advocate for the Monell Center, he was an inspired and dedicated leader. We extend our deepest sympathies to the Meyerson family.
