        POLIAK-Saul. The Board of Directors and Staff of the American Civil Liberties Union mourn the passing of a dear and generous friend, Saul Poliak. A respected innovator and business leader in the field of industry trade shows and also a devoted civil libertarian. He leaves behind a stronger and more secure First Amendment, thanks to his unfailing commitment and philanthropy. The ACLU will miss his devotion, humor, and intellect.
