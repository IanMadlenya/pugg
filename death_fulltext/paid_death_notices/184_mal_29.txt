Jay was Regional Vice President of Clear Channel Radio Sales. He led a full, active life, achieving more in his brief life than many who live much longer. Among other enthusiasms, his zest for sports was realized with his two-hour Sunday morning radio show ''For Sports'' on Los Angeles Station 1150. Jay's courage during a long illness, his steadfastness and love and devotion to family were shining examples of how life should be lived and adversity faced. He will never be forgotten. There will be a Memorial Mass at St. Ann's Roman Catholic Church, Wildwood, New Jersey, on May 23, 2002, at 11:00 A.M. In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to the Jay H.
