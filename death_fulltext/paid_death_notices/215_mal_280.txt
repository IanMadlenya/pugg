        NATKINS -- Mortimer J. Peacefully at home in Naples, Florida, surrounded by his family. Longtime resident of Great Neck, and, for 54 summers, Lake Oscawana in Putnam Valley, NY. Beloved husband of Elaine and the late Lucille Goldberg Natkins; generous, proud and sweet father of Amy, Priscilla and Mara, and their husbands, Richard, Seth and Jerry. He was an adoring and lovable brother to Eph Natkins and Sheila Reh, and to his honorary sister, Marcia Feingold. Beloved grandpa to Sarah, Molly, Lianna, Justin, Levi, Joel and Jacob. Loving uncle to many, and loyal step-dad to Liz Silver. Our dad was a lifelong ''boy from the Bronx'' who delighted in good lox (sliced thinly), The Times op-ed page, spirited political conversations, the view from his office on the 30th floor of the Empire State Building and long summer weekends at the lake with his family. He built a law practice by listening carefully and advocating articulately, and was proud to serve as Thomaston Village Justice. Shiva will be observed at Mara Natkin's and Jerry Fagliano's home in Philadelphia on January 3, at Priscilla Natkin's and Seth Novatt's home in Scarsdale on January 4, and Amy and Richard Lipton's home in Greenwich, CT, on January 5. A memorial service will be held in Naples, Florida, on January 30. In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation to the ACLU or a tsunami relief effort. Daddy, you ate your bread with gladness and drank your wine with joy. Rest in peace; we'll always love you.
