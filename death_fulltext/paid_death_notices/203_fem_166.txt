        TUCK--Jill Hope, nee Greenberg. 41, of Larchmont, NY. Born at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan, NY, Jill was an amazing mother and wife. She is survived by her father Paul Greenberg, her best friend and husband Fred and their four children, Lauren 14, Amanda 12, Jake 10 and Will 5. Jill was the daughter of the late Lenore Greenberg and sister to the late Gwen Greenberg. All three of these incredible women were tragically taken from us in an automobile accident near Akumal, Mexico on Saturday, December 20th. Jill lived with her family in Westchester County. She found a passion for horses when she was 8 years old and competed in the Hunter Class into her early adulthood. Jill's equestrian skills qualified her to show at the National Horse Show at Madison Square Garden. She graduated from the University of Virginia with a major in history and started her career at a law firm in Manhattan. She went on to work in commercial real estate at Integrated Resources. She met her soul-mate, Fred, at a Halloween party in the city and they were married two years later on Halloween day. She gave up real estate several years later to pursue her life's work as the devoted mother of her four children. In 1992, Fred and Jill moved to the Village of Larchmont in Westchester County. They soon became a moving force for the community. Jill's extensive involvement in Larchmont included being the Commissioner of the Girls' Junior Soccer League and a number of important fundraising efforts. Virtually every aspect of the community was touched by her contribution. Being a full-time mother to her four wonderful children in no way diminished her willingness to give of herself in her signature calming, self-possessed, effective and intelligent manner. She had a quiet but powerful way of bringing out the best in those around her. Our hearts are broken. Services Friday, December 26th, 10 A.M., at Larchmont Temple, 75 Larchmont Avenue, Larchmont, NY 10538.
