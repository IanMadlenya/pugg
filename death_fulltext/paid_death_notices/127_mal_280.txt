        SCHWARCZ-Dean Ernest. Queens College, its President, Trustees and Alumni celebrate the life and mourn the death of one of the great figures in its sixty year history, our beloved Dean Emeritus Ernest Schwarcz. He died tragically on August 26, 1997 at the age of 76. Born in Hungary, a survivor of the Holocaust and a profound philosopher, he broadcast to the world remembrance, learning and compassion through tireless devotion to education for everyone at any age. As Dean of General Studies, he was a great builder of continuing education, ACE, the Center for Jewish Studies, the Jewish Lecture Series, Ethnic Studies, the Black-Jewish Dialogue, and programs in China and Israel. The respect and affection he commanded in our hearts and in the world at large are boundless. We share deeply in the grief of his wife Marta, always by his side and his true compass. He made Jewish Studies and humane studies at Queens College ''a garden of learning'' that will flourish forever.
        SCHWARCZ-Ernest. The City University of New York deeply mourns the passing of Dr. Ernest Schwarcz. During nearly thirtyeight years of service to Queens College as philosophy professor; Dean of the School of General Studies; Director of ACE, the pioneering degree program for older and nontraditional students; and founder of the Center for Jewish Studies, he served with exemplary distinction and dedication. We extend deepest condolences to his family. Anne A. Paolucci, Chairwoman Board of Trustees W. Ann Reynolds, Chancellor
