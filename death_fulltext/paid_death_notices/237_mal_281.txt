        BROTMAN--Richard, Ph.D. The staff, board, and patients of the Center for Comprehensive Health Practice (CCHP) mourn the loss of Dr. Richard Brotman, our leader for the past 46 years. He was a champion of the need to make interdisciplinary health and human services available to everyone through a variety of community settings. As a professor of psychiatry at New York Medical College, he helped establish one of the nation's first federally funded community mental health centers at Metropolitan Hospital in 1966. He developed CCHP's current structure in 1974 by organizing faculty from several clinical departments under a common administration. He developed a community approach to caring for individuals and families affected by alcoholism and substance abuse that utilized a continuum of treatment interventions rather than a single modality. His concern for children and families resulted in the establishment of numerous programs, including the Early Childhood Development Center begun through collaboration with the New York City Junior League; the PAAM Program, a comprehensive service for opiate-addicted women; and a family-oriented HIV treatment program. He advocated the expansion of primary care medical training and practice long before it was fashionable. Most important to him was the perspective of the patient, and he promoted the role of ''patients as teachers'' in medical student education. He spoke often of the importance of ''one door of care'' and the idea that ''we were put on earth to serve others.'' The Staff and Board of Directors Center for Comprehensive Health Practice
