        SWIFT--Rebbetzin Ruth. Congregation Ahavath Torah deeply mourns the loss of our beloved Rebbetzin Ruth Swift. For decades, Rebbetzin Swift stood by the side of her esteemed husband, the late Rabbi Isaac Swift, of blessed memory, as together they built our community. During the years following Rabbi Swift's demise, Rebbetzin Swift continued her extraordinary work within our community and beyond. She visited the ill, comforted the bereaved, counseled those in need, established Sabbath hospitality rooms at Englewood Hospital, developed a network to visit the homebound, and aided those around her in countless other ways. She helped make us who we are as a community and always modeled who we could be. We will miss her deeply and extend our deepest sympathy to her children, grandchildren and great grandchildren. Rabbi Shmuel Goldin Kenneth Eckstein, President Englewood, NJ
