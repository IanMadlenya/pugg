        DANZIGER-Martin B. We are mourning the loss of Martin B. Danziger due to a tragic accident on July 12, 2002, on his way to his vacation home. His wife Joan, sisters Joyce and Robin, and niece Karen are saddened by this unexpected event. Martin was most recently a principal of the Danziger & Mack law firm in Washington, DC. He was formerly a founding partner of the DC office of Barst & Mukamal. Martin's exceptional career included posts as Commissioner of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, Deputy Commissioner of the INS, Director of Health and Retirement Funds for the United Mine Workers of America, and Director of the Office of Criminal Justice of the US Department of Justice. Martin was an outdoor enthusiast with passions for hiking, cycling, swimming and the training of his many German shepherds. He was a great teacher and advisor to both colleagues and young professionals.
