        COHEN -- Edward S. Ed served the New York Youth Symphony for ten years as volunteer, Board President, and Board Vice Chair. He was the very soul of the organization's mission to educate young musicians and give them the chance to perform. He applied brilliant skills as businessman and manager to the challenge of making the Symphony more effective, always asking first if a change was good for the musicians. He was a beloved leader of the board and a trusted friend to all. The staff adored him. His absence will be hugely felt, but even more important is the extraordinary legacy he has left for future generations. Heartfelt thoughts go to his loving wife Rhea, children Jonathan, Amy, Andrew, and four exceptional grandchildren. Board of Trustees New York Youth Symphony Leslie J. Garfield, Chair Robert L.
