        KART-Harold. You left us too soon. The years we spent together will be cherished forever. We will miss your smiling face and your practical jokes. We will miss your sincerity, honesty, generosity and loving friendship. Your love for your family and friends will be admired forever. You have left a void in our hearts. We love you and will surely miss you. Hold a spot for us at the first tee! Roberta and Richie

        Harold. His family will miss his loving guidance, his many charities lost a wonderful producer and cheerleader, but his many many friends lost their star. The brightest light is out. Bunny and Martin Mann and Family
