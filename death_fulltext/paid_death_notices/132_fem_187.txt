        ROGERS-Pearl. We will miss your smile, spirit and sense of humor, and thank you for some of our most cherished memories. Most of all, we will miss you as a warm and loving friend and mother, and you shall remain in our hearts forever. Respects at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home, 1076 Madison Ave. at 81 Street, NYC on Friday, January 23, from 10 AM to noon. In lieu of flowers please make donations in her memory to the American Cancer Society. With Love, Beth, Debbie, Bruce and Les
