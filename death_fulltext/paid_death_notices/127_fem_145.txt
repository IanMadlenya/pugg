        DORFMAN-Janis. The Lord has given and the Lord has taken away, praised be the name of the Lord. As we mourn the untimely passing of Janis Dorfman, we are painfully reminded that life itself is but a loan. And so, as we come to grips with our mortality and the brevity of our lives, we can only look back with gratitude on the fond memories we have-and will always have-of this precious jewel entrusted to us. To our esteemed Board Members, Chai Founders, generous supporters, but most of all, cherished friends, Stanley and Evelyn Marks, and Janis' entire family, we offer our profound sympathy. Janis' incredible courage and determination is a legacy of inspiration for all. And, her family's love, care and devotion brought light where there was darkness, hope where there was despair. We pray that G-d will grant courage and strength to the bereaved family and help them rise above the painful sorrow which has befallen them. May G-d destroy death forever and wipe away tears from every face. Josh S. Weston, Chairman Rabbi Moshe Linchner, V. Chmn. Rabbi Ronald L. Gray, Exec. VP
