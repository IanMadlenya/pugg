        EDELMAN-Albert I. The Rockefeller University community is deeply saddened by the passing of our cherished friend, Albert Edelman, a dedicated member of the RU Council for the past decade. His generous support of the University's mission has made possible many advances in biomedical research. We will miss his warmth, his engaging wit, and his sincere interest in the life of the University and in the progress of science. We extend our deepest condolences to our Council member Eleanor, to her children Gwen, Thomas, Jennifer, and Cornelia, to her granddaughters Elizabeth and Eleanor, and to the late Mr. Edelman's brother, Daniel. Thomas P. Sakmar, Acting President Richard M. Furlaud, Chairman, RU Council Richard B. Fisher, Chairman David Rockefeller, Honorary Chairman
