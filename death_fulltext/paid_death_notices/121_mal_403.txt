        ROSSETTI-Roy, 64, passed away on February 26, 1997. Born in New York to a family coming from Siena, Italy, Mr. Roy Rossetti served as Executive Secretary of the Italy America Chamber of Commerce for twelve years, until 1995, working with six different presidents, thus becoming a focal point amongst the business community that lives and operates in this area, trading between Italy and the U.S. Hard working, loyal and imaginative, Mr. Rossetti carried out the activities of the Chamber, initiating and cultivating business and commercial contacts both in Italy and the United States. He proved to be instrumental in shaping the guidelines of the Chamber and creating new programs aimed to its improvement and development. His leading presence in the Chamber assured the continuity of the commercial bonds between the two countries and was therfore of key importance. It is also thanks to him that the Italy-America Chamber of Commerce, the first Chamber in this country linking Italy and the United States, founded in 1887, is the main point of reference for business men of the two countries. For all these reasons the President of the Republic of Italy, Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, bestowed upon him the honorific title of Commendatore in the Order of Merit of the Republic of Italy. Mr. Rossetti is survived by his beloved wife, Paola, daughter Claudia, along with relatives and numerous friends. Services to be held in Miami on February 28, 1997, Van Orsdel Funeral Chapel (305) 446-4412.
