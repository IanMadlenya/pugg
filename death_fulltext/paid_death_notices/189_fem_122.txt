        NELSOVA-Zara. In loving memory of our late, gracious friend Zara Nelsova, brilliant performer, inspiring teacher, perhaps the greatest female cellist of the 20th century, who concentrated all of her intelligence, physical energy, and artistry into every performance, and gave so generously to her art and to all those who knew her. From her students and faculty colleagues, who plan a musical tribute to her early in 2003. Dept of Music, Mason Gross School of the Arts, Rutgers University
