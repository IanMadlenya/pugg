        SEIDEN--Harold (Hal) of New Hyde Park was born on August 1, 1920 in New York. He passed away in his sleep on January 11, 2003, having just achieved his 60th wedding anniversary to his devoted and beloved wife, Jessica Greenberg Seiden. A graduate of Brooklyn College, Hal was a well-known and highly regarded motion picture cameraman, and long-time member of I.A.T.S.E. Local 644. His father Joseph was a motion picture pioneer, and a producer and director of Yiddish films. Hal was fortunate to have turned a life-long passion and hobby into a career--photographing presidents, numerous sports events including the summer and winter Olympics, ABC Wide World of Sports, Major League Baseball, and golf, and working on award-winning documentaries and commercials. He is succeeded by his wife and soul-mate Jessica; his sister, Marilyn Bloom; his three sons, Michael, Richard, and Matthew; and four beloved grandchildren, Marc, Miles, Carolyn, and Laura.
