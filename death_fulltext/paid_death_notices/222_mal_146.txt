        LAUTMAN--Benjamin Harris. With profound sadness, William and Wendy (King) Lautman mourn the loss of their dearly loved son, Benjamin Harris Lautman, whose little heart failed on July 14, 2005. His four short years filled his family with tremendous joy and an extraordinary appreciation for the simple things in life. His smile brought laughter and love to everyone whose life he touched. He is the adored grandson of Susan and Robert King of Westport, Connecticut, and Dan and JoAnn Lautman of Los Angeles, California, and the beloved great grandson of Margery B. Neuhaus of Baltimore, Maryland. He will be deeply missed by his special treasure of friends...Thomas Percy, James, Gordon, Toby, Emily, Chocolate Percy, Edward, Ben, Bill, Henry, Salty, Diesel Ten, Dirty Percy and a trainload of others. The family asks that in lieu of flowers, all contributions in honor of Ben be sent to the Bless Your Heart Fund at Columbia University, c/o Lautman, 201 W. 70th St., Apt 39E, N.Y., N.Y. 10023. A memorial service will be held at 10AM Sunday, July 17, 2005 at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 W. 76th Street at Amsterdam Ave, New York City, followed by a graveside service in Tucson, Arizona on Monday.
