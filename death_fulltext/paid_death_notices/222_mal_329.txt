        JACOBSON--Ishier. The staff and directors of Silver Hill Hospital mourn the passing of Ishier Jacobson, a Director since 1988 and Chairman of the Board of Directors from 1990 to 2002. Ishier guided the hospital with unfailing wisdom, clarity and devotion. His commitment to the mission of the hospital and his concern for the well being of its staff were an inspiration. While we will miss his active leadership, his imprint on our hospital will endure.
