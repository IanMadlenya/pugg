        WILLIAMS--James. It is with deep sorrow that William Paterson University mourns the passing of our colleague and friend, James Williams, a gifted jazz pianist, composer and educator. James embodied the connection between performance and teaching. He had a wonderful, rare and unusual combination of qualities: he was the consummate musician and pianist, had a deep, soulful commitment to the music and its history, and had the gift of being able to communicate that to students at all levels of experience. As associate professor of music and director of William Paterson's Jazz Studies Program since 1999, James was instrumental in bringing jazz legends such as Clark Terry and Billy Taylor to work with our students. He also was active in establishing the Thad Jones Archives at the University and arranging the permanent residency of the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra and played a central role in further developing William Paterson's critically ac claimed Jazz Room Series. James brought his array of musical and life experiences to the William Paterson campus each day and he will be greatly missed. We extend our deepest condolences to his family, friends, and the international jazz community. Arnold Speert, President
