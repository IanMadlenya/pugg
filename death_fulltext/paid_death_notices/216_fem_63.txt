        DREZNICK -- Rachelle. On January 6, 2005. Beloved wife of the late Henry Dreznick. Beloved mother of Dr. Jeffrey Dreznick, Dr. Elliott Dreznick and Lisa Dreznick Waller, Esq. Beloved motherin-law of Carol Fisher Dreznick, Esq. and Dr. Scott Waller. Beloved bubbe of Randa, Courtney, Stephen and Benjamin. Beloved sister of Mary Tolmatch, Leah Fixman, and the late Reva Nachfolger Kurtzman. A dedicated, devoted and beloved educator, she enlightened many students' minds and remembered not only all her students but where they even sat. Rachelle attended McGill University on a scholarship despite religious quotas, but had to leave after her freshman year to care for her terminally-ill father. She then graduated from Sir George Williams University in Montreal and obtained her Master's from Brooklyn College. Vibrant, vivacious, and so full of life, she waged a valiant battle against an aggressive, relentless illness. Poet laureate and president of her synagogue's Sisterhood for the past 14 years, Rachelle was also a wonderful friend, aunt and nurturer. Mom, you were a selfless, wonderful and caring individual who, like Dad, lived life for your family. We will miss your effervescence, charm and wit and we'll miss you to no end. We hope you take our love for you with you and we hope you are at peace. There will never be a day when we don't think about you. Our love forever, your family. Services will be held Sunday, January 9, at 1:15PM at Sinai Chapels, 162-05 Horace Harding Expressway, Fresh Meadows. For shiva information call 646-831-7807
