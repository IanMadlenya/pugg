        HIRSCH--Irene Ruth Rosenberg Frede. Died suddenly in Sunny Isles Beach, Florida, on December 30, 2004. Adored wife of the late Sidne Frede and the late Richard Goodman Hirsch, beloved mother of Adria, Francine and Candace Frede and stepmother of Nancy Hirsch, and devoted grandmother of Sidne and Joshua Koenigsberg. Frankly, she was terrific.
