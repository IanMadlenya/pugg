        FAHERTY--George E. Adelphi University mourns the passing of former athletic director and basketball coach, George E. Faherty. The recent recipient of Adelphi's President's Award of Merit, he served Adelphi with distinction from 1951-1966, elevating the caliber of the athletic program and earning the respect and devotion of athletes and colleagues. Under his leadership, Adelphi teams played in 5 NCAA and NAIA postseason tournaments, won the prestigious Schoenfeld Sportsmanship Award three times, and were selected as Number One in the East by the ECAC. His devotion to the highest standards in sportsmanship and performance continue to inspire Adelphi's athletic program and will be exemplified in the new sports center being designed. Our thoughts are with his daughter Victoria Pineles and the entire Faherty family. The family requests contributions in his memory be made to the University's George E. Faherty Fund. Robert A. Scott, President Steven N. Fischer, Chairman, Board of Trustees Robert Hartwell, Director of Athletics John S. Borden, V.P. for University Advancement
