        CHERNOTSKY -- Leila. We extend our sincerest condolences to Rachel (and Paul) Glasser, Sandy (and Barry) Nussbaum, Harry (and Elaine) Chernotsky, and Isaac (and Sherry) Chernotsky on the loss of their beloved mother. A spirited, sensitive and caring person with an infectious love of life and love of people, her dignity, integrity and positive attitude, even under adversity, made her a role model par excellence to her adoring children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and many friends. May the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. American Committee for Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem Family
