        SCHWEITZER--Nathan, formerly of Manhattan. On March 22, 2005. Beloved husband of Ava J. Cherished father of Patricia Joy of Montclair, N.J., and the late Nancy Schweitzer. Loving grandfather of Julia Rubenfeld. Nathan attended The Horace Mann School, Cornell University, and was President of Nathan Schweitzer Meat & Poultry Corporation. A World War II veteran, he was also a long-standing member of the Masons and the Park Avenue Synagogue. As a resident of The Hebrew Home in Riverdale, he became an accomplished and prolific painter. Endowed with a sweet, smiling, sanguine nature and unflagging courage in the face of severe disability, Nathan touched the spirits of all around him and will be sorely missed. Memorial service at a later date.
