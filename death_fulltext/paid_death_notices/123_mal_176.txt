        CANTWELL-Dennis, M.D. The faculty and staff of the Child Study Center of the New York University Medical Center and New York University School of Medicine mourn the loss of their esteemed colleague, Dennis Cantwell, M.D., the Joseph Campbell Professor of Child Psychiatry at UCLA. Denny was the quintessential child and adolescent psychiatrist, a clinician extraordinaire, a gifted teacher, a productive researcher and a caring and generous colleague. He will be missed by his patients and their families and by all of his colleagues who benefited from his mentorship and wisdom. We extend our condolences to his wife Susan and their children.
