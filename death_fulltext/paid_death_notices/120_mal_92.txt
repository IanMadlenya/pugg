        HEYMAN - Samuel. The community of West End Synogogue is Saddened by the death of this longtime member. We extend our condolences to his wife Esther, his daughter Rachel, his son and daughter-in-law Dan and Fran, and to his grandchildren Tevye, Caleb and Hannah. Sam's long illness obscured his passion for life and prevented hm from continuing to be the outgoing, vital man he had been. We remember his warmth and his great love for his family. May his memory always be for a blessing.  Donald Shapiro, Chair  Rabbi Avi Winokur  Cantor Nancy Abramson  West End Synogogue
