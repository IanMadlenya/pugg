        OSTERWEIS--Steven L. The 92nd Street Y Board and staff mourn the passing of long time Board Member Steven L. Osterweis. A devoted member of the Y community since 1970, Steven was a successful and respected businessman, who devoted himself to the organizations in which he believed. We will miss his dedication and his enthusiasm for all that the Y does-in particular, the classic music and childrens' education programs. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Harriet, their children, Marian, Laurie, and John, grandchildren Sarah, Max, Ariel, and Daphne, and great grandchild, Cecilia. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Michael Goldstein, Pres Matthew Bronfman, Chrmn Sol Adler, Exec Dir
