        ROSS--Edythe ''Moms''. Today I have lost the best part of me--YOU! My lifelong friend, my beautiful role model, my mother. I can only find solace in the knowledge that you are at peace and no longer struggling to live. Every child should be blessed with a mother like you. Those who are whisked away by material things are paupers in the eyes of G-d. Lori
