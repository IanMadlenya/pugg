        HOELLERING--Michael F. The Board and staff of the American Arbitration Association are deeply saddened by the passing of Michael F. Hoellering, longtime General Counsel of the Association and recognized international leader in the field of arbitration and mediation. Mr. Hoellering devoted many years of exceptional service to the Association, marked by his wisdom, grace, and high personal standards. Joining us as New York Regional Director in 1959, he moved to serve as General Counsel for 19 years until his retirement in 1999. Mr. Hoellering continued to contribute his skill to the field post-retirement, serving as a preeminent arbitrator and mediator on our commercial and international panels. In recognition of his distinguished service as counsel and champion of alternative dispute resolution procedures, the Association established the Hoellering Fellowship in his honor. The fellowship is awarded to an outstanding individual committed to advancing international dispute resolution. We extend our most sincere and heartfelt condolences to Mr. Hoellering's family.
