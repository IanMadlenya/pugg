        THOMAS-Alexander, M.D., Professor of Psychiatry. The NYU School of Medicine and the Department of Psychiatry wish to express our profound sympathy to the family of Dr. Alexander Thomas, on his untimely death. Dr. Thomas was a devoted, highly prized member of the Department of Psychiatry and made significant contributions as a scientist and administrator. With his wife, Dr. Stella Chess, he was in the forefront of studies in temperament. He wrote extensively and was internationally recognized. He served for more than ten years as Director of Psychiatry at Bellevue Hospital Center. Dr. Thomas graduated from NYU School of Medicine as the youngest member of his class in 1936, and was elected to Alpha Omega Alpha. After World War II, he returned as a resident in psychiatry and joined the faculty in 1948. He is responsible, with Dr. Chess, for the training of child psychiatrists on an international basis. We are deeply saddened by the loss of his future contributions to us all. He will be sorely missed. Robert M. Glickman, M.D., Dean, NYU School of Medicine Robert Cancro, M.D., Chairman, Department of Psychiatry, NYU School of Medicine
