        GLATZER-Dr. Henriette T. You were a joy-filled friend; you were a wonderful teacher; you pinch-hit as a parent and grandparent; you never missed an important event. You gave more than we can give back. We will try to carry on what mattered most to you. We love you. Rest in peace. Priscilla, Daniel and Melanie
