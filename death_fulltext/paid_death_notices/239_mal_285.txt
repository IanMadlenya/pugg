        SHWEDER--Jerry My dear sweet man, my dear sweet man, my dear sweet man. 63 years -we shared everything Bun
        SHWEDER--Jerry The most humble master of life and sacrifice. A diamond. Multifaceted. A holy Knight who showed the way. Rob, Martha, Gabe and Jaya.
        SHWEDER--Jerry of Great Neck, NY On December 23, 2006. Soul mate and precious husband of Bonnie Shweder (Miller). Cherished father of Richard and Candy, Robert and Martha, Robin and Falguni, and Ronni, who died toosoon. Grandfather of Jeremy and Sylvia, Tamar and Matthew, Lauren and Matthew, Gabriel and Jaya. Greatgrandfather of Mia and Harrison. A gorgeous man with no vanity. Dad was the hub. Weekend phone calls kept the wheels of his far flung family turning: what will Saturday mornings be without him? A sweet devoted son. The father every child wants. His children and grandchildren loved him to high heaven. A 1940s Brooklyn college intellectual, kept up with political affairs, daily read his New York Times. A true friend. Sensitive, understanding and generous. He would say, ''Put your right foot forward.'' We feel only grief and the depth of our loss.
