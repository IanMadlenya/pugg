        COGEN-Charles. The Officers and members of the United Federation of Teachers mourn the loss of Charles Cogen, the founding president of the UFT. By winning the nation's first contract for teachers he set the stage for current education reforms and was a pioneer in the continuing struggle to win professional dignity and respect for teachers everywhere. We extend our deepest sympathy to the surviving family. Public school teachers and students throughout the nation owe him a great debt of thanks. The Officers and Members of The UFT Randi Weingarten, President
