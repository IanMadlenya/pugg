        GRUNWALD--Henry A. The American Austrian Foundation deeply mourns the loss of Ambassador Henry A. Grunwald, an effective, creative leader of our work, having served with distinction as the United States Ambassador to Austria. As Ambassador and as a dedicated member of our board, he worked tirelessly to bring together his native Austria and his beloved America. His focus, insight and wise counsel will long continue to strengthen those ties. We extend our sincere condolences to his wife, Louise, and to his devoted children and their families. Milton A. Wolf, Chairman William J. vanden Heuvel, Vice Chairman Thomas J. McGrath, President
