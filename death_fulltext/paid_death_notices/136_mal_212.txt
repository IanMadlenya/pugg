        McINTYRE-James C. Died unexpectedly in his sleep on May 15, 1998 at his country home in Pennsylvania. Jim has a legacy of success in arts management from North Carolina to Carnegie Hall to the Big Apple Circus. He left each organization in better shape then when he arrived, a real accomplishment in this day and a testament to his management skills. More important, he maintained the friendship and respect of his colleagues throughout his career. His wit, laughter and caring nature will be missed by all whose lives he touched. Services are scheduled for Wednesday, May 20th, 5PM at the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine (1047 Amsterdam Avenue at 112 Street, NYC.) There will be a brief reception following the service at the Cathedral. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Big Apple Circus, Clown Care Unit.
