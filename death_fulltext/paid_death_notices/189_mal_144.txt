        WALSH-Albert J. What a great shock and what a great loss to the people of The City of New York. Al was the premier expert in the field of subsidized housing for persons of limited income. Having served as Deputy Commissioner of The State Division of Housing, and Community Renewal, and thereafter, as Commissioner of Housing for The City of New York, Al was the power behind many of the large-scale subsidized housing developments in our City that made available much - needed, affordable housing. ABO was honored that he served as our Chairman for our Mitchell-Lama Housing Committee. He was a special talented and rare human being whom we shall miss deeply. Our sincerest condolences are extended to his charming and devoted wife, Nan.
