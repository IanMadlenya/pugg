        GATEHOUSE -- Suzanne. A lovely flower has wilted: the earthly life of Suzanne Gatehouse that lit so many lives with her unstinting effervescence, exuberant laughter and sheer joy, passed on January 19 at South Nassau Community Hospital in Oceanside, Long Island (NY 11572), close to her home in Lawrence. She was the daughter of the late John P. Gatehouse and Marie Kennedy Gatehouse, and is survived by her first cousin, Charles C. Bingham, many second cousins, and numerous devoted friends. A Mass of Christian burial will be said at 10 A.M. on Friday, January 23, at Saint Joachim's Church at 614 Central Avenue, Cedarhurst, Long Island (NY 11516). Donations in her memory may be made to the hospital or church.
