        LEBOW-Sylvan. The Officers and Board of the North American Federation of Temple Brotherhoods and Jewish Chautauqua Society record with profound sorrow the passing of Sylvan Lebow, former Executive Director of NFTB and JCS for 25 years. A pioneer for the Brotherhood Movement, Interfaith Relations, and Reform Judaism, Lebow left an indelible mark on the men's arm of the Reform Movement in America and its interfaith program, one of the oldest in the United States. Known for his creativity and innovations, Lebow's contributions to his faith, his people, and community were invaluable. May his memory be a blessing for future generations.
