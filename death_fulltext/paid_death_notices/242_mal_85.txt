        ZEISLER--Richard S. The Trustees and Staff of The Museum of Modern Art mourn the passing of Richard S. Zeisler. A MoMA member since 1950, Richard joined the Board of Trustees in 1979 and was elected a Life Trustee in 1995. He served with distinction and dedication as a member of the International Council (1960-2007 and its Treasurer from 1989-1991), the Committee on Painting and Sculpture (since 1972), and as an honorary member of the Committee on Architecture and Design (since 1989). We are grateful for his generosity to the Museum's recent expansion project, and for the gifts of outstanding works of art now in our collection, including Rene Magritte's, The Lovers. Richard will be sorely missed. He will be remembered with affection and respect for his intelligence, thoughtfulness, and commitment to MoMA. We extend our deepest sympathy to his family. David Rockefeller, Honorary Chairman Ronald S. Lauder, Chairman Emeritus Agnes Gund, President Emerita Robert B. Menschel, Chairman Marie-Josee Kravis, President Glenn D. Lowry, Director Brian Urquhart, Chairman Emeritus Agnes Gund, Chairman Jo Carole Lauder, President The International Council of The Museum of Modern Art
