        DOCKSTADER-Frederick J. The Board of Trustees and staff of the Huntington Free Library and Reading Room mourn the death of friend and colleague, Frederick J. Dockstader. A trustee of the library for almost 30 years, we will remember him for his unwavering support of the library, his significant contribution to Native American studies, and his sunny disposition. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Alice.
