        MILLER-John L. We are saddened by the loss of a founding member of the North Shore University Hospital family. Years before North Shore became a reality, this civic leader sprearheaded a drive to build a community hospital. As superintendent of the Great Neck School System, he understood the need for a fine, local medical facility and worked for decades to insure its completion and success. He contributed a host of skills, helping to shape the medical facility that has become the premier health-care system in the region. Our deepest sympathy is extended to his family members. Saul Katz and Roy J. Zuckerberg, Co-chairmen, Board of Trustees John S. T. Gallagher and David R. Dantzker, M.D., Co-President and CEO North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System
