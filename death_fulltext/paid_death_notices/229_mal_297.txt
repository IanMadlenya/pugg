        COHANE--Jakob T., MD. Jaks sheer brilliance, his mastery of seven languages, his insight into human nature and his gentleness endeared him to all those lives he touched. Against all odds, Jak put himself through medical school, he became a renowned internist, specializing in endocrinology, then recognizing the emotional pain of so many of his patients he became a Psychiatrist. His psychiatric residency was at New York Hospital Cornell Medical Center followed by a private practice in psychiatry. He retired in 1995. Jak will be sorely missed and leaves us all with loving memories. Andy, Joyce, Devona, Andrew & Jakob Morrissey
