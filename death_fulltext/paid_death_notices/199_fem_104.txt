        FRIEDMAN--Sylvia N. The HIAS (Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society) family mourns the loss of Dr. Sylvia N. Friedman, of New York. An active Jewish community leader, Dr. Friedman had served on the HIAS board since 1980 and was made an honorary member in 1998. She was active with several causes on the national and international levels. A former president of NYANA, Dr. Friedman also served on the UJA-Federation of New York, the American Joint Distribution Committee and the Council of Jewish Federations, among other organizations. Her husband, Harold, was a past president of HIAS, from 1969-1973. Their son, the Hon. Lewis R. Friedman, also served on the HIAS board, from 1981 until his death in 1998. A granddaughter, Karen Friedman, is a current member of the HIAS board. Leonard Glickman, President & CEO Jerome Teller, Chairman of the Board
