        FEERICK-Donald J. He had no sounding that it was the twilight of his years when he turned his steps toward Daytop to walk among a Town's walking-wounded young and to offer his saving hands. A Man of infinite gentleness, Donald Feerick was on a spiritual mission. Oscar Wilde best captured it: ''And somehow life is bigger after all than any painted angel; could we see the God that is within us!'' The Board of Governors and the legions of Daytop young people mourn his passing and offer prayerful support to his beloved Meg and Family. (Msgr.) William B. O'Brien President, Daytop Village, Inc.
