        WOODD - CAHUSAC -- Sydney A. The Rockefeller University deeply mourns the loss of our beloved friend Sydney A. Woodd - Cahusac, former treasurer and counsel, and a dedicated member of The Rockefeller University Council. He fostered generous support for a great many University endeavors, particularly clinical research initiatives in the University's Hospital, while freely sharing his wisdom, warmth, and passion with all members of the Rockefeller community. He will be remembered with the utmost admiration for his pursuit of greater enlightenment and his service to the community, from his leadership at Iwo Jima to his career in the law and business, leading ultimately to his canonship in the Episcopal Church. He was foremost a friend and will be greatly missed. We extend our heartfelt condolences to the entire Woodd-Cahusac family. Richard B. Fisher, Chairman David Rockefeller Honorary Chairman Richard M.
