        RATZKER--Paula. We mourn the loss of this exceptional matriarch. A woman of strong personality and strong will, she used these qualities to help herself and her family overcome the tragedies and suffering of the Holocaust. A loving mother, grandmother and great-grandmother who loyally supported Shaare Zedek for decades, Mrs. Ratzker personified the characteristics of honesty and compassionate caring. She dedicated her life and left a legacy to her family of the loftiest values of Jewish tradition and ethics. Sincerest condolences to children Menno and Helen; grandchildren Paul and Malkie, Michael and Drorit, Jeff and Stefanie; and greatgrandchildren Zachary, Jake, Carlie, Tommi, Alex, Gabrielle, Emily, Sophia, Ben, and Kyle. May they be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
