        FISHMAN--David, 90 years old, January 7, 1915-May 13, 2005. Dear Dad, you are the heart and soul of our family. You taught us to have the strength of our own convictions. Your devotions and love to mom was unconditional and her love to you was the same. Both you and mom were the bond in our family. Your sweet smile and twinkle in your eyes will be in our memories forever. We will miss you dearly and we are sure Atlantic City and the mall walkers will miss you too! We love you. Melvin, Amelia and Edward.
