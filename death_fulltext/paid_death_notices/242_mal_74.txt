        CAMPBELL--Charles J., M.D. We are deeply saddened by the passing of Dr. Charles J. Campbell, the former ophthalmologist-in-chief and executive officer at the E.S. Harkness Eye Institute of NewYork Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center, where he served with distinction for 30 years, until his retirement in 1987. Surgery-sparing optical diagnostic and treatment tools that he developed, including the first laser to be successfully employed in the treatment of ocular disease, continue to benefit countless patients. A superb and compassionate clinician, skilled teacher, gifted researcher and gentleman, Dr. Campbell was a personal friend and beloved by all. Our heartfelt condolences are extended to the Campbell family. Herbert Pardes, M.D. President & CEO Steven J. Corwin, M.D. Executive Vice President & COO NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital
