        PETTY-William L. Former Executive Director and Board member of Clearpool, Inc., passed March 21, 2000. There are no words adequate to express the void his loss creates for all who knew and loved him. Bill's extraordinary record of service during World War II and almost 40 years of devoted service to children while Executive Director of Clearpool form a legacy of remarkable achievement. We will miss him greatly. Clearpool, its staff, Board and friends offer sincere condolences to the Petty family. Contributions in his memory may be made to Clearpool, Inc., 107 Washington St., 3rd Flr., NY, NY 10006
