        ELYACHAR-Anna Tulin. The Yeshiva University family mourns the passing of a dear friend, a distinguished communal leader who, with her late, beloved husband Colonel Jehiel R. Elyachar, was a YU Benefactor. Her participation and interest in Yeshiva University over the years will be sorely missed. May her stepdaughter, Ruth Elyachar Turner, and the enire Elyachar/Tulin family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University Robert M. Beren, Chairman Board of Trustees
