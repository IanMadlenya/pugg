        MARCH-Jerry. 68. Professor Emeritus. Jerry March, a recently retired professor of Organic Chemistry at Adelphi University in Garden City, died December 25, 1997 of pancreatic cancer. Dr. March was born on August 1, 1929 in Brooklyn, NY. He received a B.S. from City College in 1951, a Master's Degree from Brooklyn College in 1953, and a Ph.D. from Penn State University in 1956. Dr. March taught at Adelphi University for 41 years. His seminal reference-Advanced Organic Chemistry-is known worldwide and has been a mainstay among chemists for 30 years. He co-authored several other texts on chemistry as well as contributing to The Encyclopedia Britannica. For several years he was asked to participate in the nomination of Nobel Prize Laureates. He had a life-long love of music and opera and participated in many amateur theater and singing groups. For the past decade, he volunteered time to Recording for the Blind. He is survived by his wife, Beverly, of Garden City, NY; children, Gale Ackerman, David March and June Price; grandchildren, Justin, Jennifer and Jessica Ackerman, Nancy Hutchins, Rachel, Nathan and Ben Price; and brother Fred March. He ultimately wanted to be known as a teacher-a profession to which he dedicated his life. Memorial service to be held at Adelphi University in Garden City, NY is being planned for January.
