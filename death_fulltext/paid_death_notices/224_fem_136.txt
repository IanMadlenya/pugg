        WARREN--Roz. Your leaving has created a void which can never be filled. I shall forever miss the sound of your voice, your great laugh and your sense of humor. You have two beautiful daughters, as I have, which we joked about, you saying you followed me in doing this. You possessed the ultimate in elegance and an innate talent for creating beauty in all your surroundings. I love you and shall forever miss you, Roz. Mae Buchbinder
        $(6$)WARREN -- Rosalind. Our deepest condolences go out to Gene, Shawn, Jennifer, Bill, Steve, Ryan and Jessica. Roz was a great lady--a fashion maven, a wonderful wife, a caring mother and a truly lovely person. She was part of our family as well as yours. Love, the Rhodie Family
