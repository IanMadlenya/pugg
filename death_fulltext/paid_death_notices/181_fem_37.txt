        BERNSTEIN-Martha. An extraordinary life has ended, nearly a century after it began, and we are poorer for it. As matriarch of the Bernstein clan, she had the steely resolve to encourage and support her sons as they founded Sanford C. Bernstein and Co., and a tender touch to spread her love throughout her extensive family. Survived by son Paul, grandchildren Claude, Leslie, David, Stefanie and eight great-grandchildren; ''grandnana'' will be missed, but we are comforted knowing she finally is united with her husband Jacob, sister Edith and son Zalman. Paul, Peggy, Elaine, David and Stephanie
        BERNSTEIN-Martha. On February 3, 2002. In lieu of flowers, expressions of sympathy may be sent to the Dotan Scholarship Fund, c/o Sanford C. Bernstein, 767 Fifth Ave, New York, NY 10153.
