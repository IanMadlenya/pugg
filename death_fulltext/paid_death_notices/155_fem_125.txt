        CHALL-Jeanne S., Dr. We note with sadness the passing of Dr. Jeanne S. Chall, an outstanding teacher and researcher in the field of developmental and remedial reading. While at the Educational Clinic of City College of New York, she inspired many graduate students in psychology and in education. Dr. Chall had a profound influence, and we are grateful for her enduring legacy. Susan H. Blumenthal, Ed.D. Miriam T. Brous, Ed.D.
