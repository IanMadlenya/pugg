        SHAPIRO--Doris Mintz, 89, of West Hartford, CT, died on Sunday evening, May 13, 2007 after a long illness. A lifelong reader and keen observer of American history and politics, Mrs. Shapiro worked as a librarian at Trinity College, Hartford, before retiring 28 years ago. She was married for 53 years to Isaac Shapiro, who died in 1995. Born in Hartford, she was the daughter of the late David and Rose (Marholin) Mintz. Mrs. Shapiro graduated from Hartford High School and received her bachelor's and master's degree from Mount Holyoke College. Her 1940 graduate thesis examined leadership of the American women's rights movement. After retirement, Mrs. Shapiro was a devoted volunteer at the Deborah Library of Congregation Beth Israel, in West Hartford. She is survived by her three daughters and their families: Joan and Franklin Green of New York City; Phyllis Shapiro and Partha Bagchi of Readington, NJ; and Ruth Shapiro and Bruce Frankel of Larchmont, NY. Mrs. Shapiro was a loving grandmother to her four grandchildren: Jeffrey Green and his wife, Amy von Sydow Green, Julia Green and her fiance Andy Shane, Max Frankel, and Alison Frankel and to her great-granddaughter, Kitty Silveria Green. $(6$)SHAPIRO--Doris Mintz.
