        ISRAEL-Richard J., Rabbi. Hillel Council of New England notes with sorrow the death of our founding Director, Richard J. Israel. Dick's strength, intelligence, commitment and humor were major factors in the development of the community's concern for the needs of Jewish college students, particularly those at small schools without a Hillel Foundation. Our deepest sympathy to his beloved wife and our good friend Sherry and their children and grandchildren. ''Thou shalt be missed because thy seat will be empty'', 1 Samuel 20:18. Ruth Savin Greenberg, President Samuel I. Mendales, Executive Director Hillel Council of New England
