        GARBER - Sherry. Darling wife, sister, mommy, Oma. You are the ''iconic'' eshet chayil. A woman who was born with a selfless devotion to every aspect of her family's lives. You didn't have to show it by ''doing'' it. Your very ''being'' sufficed. The many gifts you had--comedy, drama, culinary expertise, motherhood, worrier, warrior, winner--are in each and every one of us. Just being around you made us better, happier, fuller. We will smile with you as you smile upon us forever.
