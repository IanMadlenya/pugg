        RACHLEFF--Jack. DRS Technologies, Inc., mourns the passing of our former board member Jack Rachleff. Jack was a good friend to Leonard Newman, encouraging and supporting his founding of DRS in 1968. Jack will be remembered as a visionary, whose interest in technology and innovation helped to guide the course of DRS in its early years. He was a member of the DRS Board from 1968 until his retirement in 1998. Mark S. Newman, Chairman, President and CEO of DRS considered Jack a mentor, confidant and friend. His ability to inspire and achieve will be missed by all. We extend our condolences to his wife Lillian, son Andrew, daughter-in-law Debbie, and grandchildren Shelby and Jake.
