        TRESCHER--George. It's just possible that The Municipal Art Society would not have survived to celebrate its 100th birthday, let alone last year's 109th had there been no George Trescher to organize and bully us into one beautiful and beautifully profitable fundraising dinner after another. The more nervous we became as the evenings approached, the cooler George was; the more loose ends we tripped over, the quicker George came to our rescue. He was the best in his business, and when we needed him most he was our best friend. The Municipal Art Society of New York
        TRESCHER -- George. The city that never sleeps owes more than a little of its glittering reputation to the extraordinary work of George Trescher. A charming, caring gentleman with rigorous standards, George never let anyone down. A consummate professional who cared deeply about the charities he served, he was a fierce defender of the things that matter in New York. Things will not be the same. Stephen C. Swid, Chairman Emeritus, Municipal Art Society of New York >>AD#
