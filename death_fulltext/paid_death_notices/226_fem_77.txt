        SALMANOWITZ--Betty (nee Pollack), 80, but young at heart, on November 9, 2005 in Naples, Florida. Beloved and patient wife of nearly 60 years of Harold; loving and devoted mother of Barbara, Richard, John and David; doting and proud grandmother of Rebecca, Josh, Michael, Jenny, Rachel and Natalie; and great-grandmother of Gad and Odelia. She loved winning at tennis and bridge, her daily crossword puzzle, dressing up and being out and about. We will fondly remember her for the loving, active, vivacious, generous, stubborn and feisty lady that she was. A remembrance gathering will be held at 1 P.M. on Monday, November 14 at Fuller Funeral Home in Naples. No flowers please. Contributions to Hospice of Naples, EMS of Collier County, or Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brookline, MA., would be appreciated.
