        ALLEN-Steve. The Officers, Governors and Members of the New York Friars Club deeply mourn the loss of their esteemed longtime Member Steve Allen. He put the gold in the golden age of television, not to mention the rhythm. His genius for comedy and for music has given him an esteemed and valued place in the annals of show business. We are honored and proud to have been touched by this pioneer of American Television. Alan King, Abbot Freddie Roman, Dean Sally Jessy Raphael, Prior David B. Cornstein, Treasurer Stewie Stone, Scribe Jean-Pierre Trebot, Executive Director
