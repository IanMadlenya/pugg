        MANDELA--Makgatho. The American Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR) joins the Mandela family and the people of South Africa in mourning the passing of Makgatho Mandela, 54, who died of AIDS-related illness in Johannesburg on Thursday. Though theirs is an enormous loss, the Mandela family does not grieve in silence and they do not grieve alone. They join millions of South Africans who have lost loved ones to HIV/AIDS, many having suffered needlessly from the prejudice, scorn and misunderstanding that still shrouds HIV in mystery. More than five million women, men and children in South Africa are living with HIV infection. Millions more are affected every day by the stigma and discrimination that defeat the generosity of spirit and courage that have always characterized the tireless advocacy of Nelson Mandela. amfAR stands with him and all of those South Africans who look forward to a life free of fear and hatred.
