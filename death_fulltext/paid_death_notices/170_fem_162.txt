        SOUTHGATE-Anna F. Of Manchester, Massachusetts, died on Sunday, March 18, after a short illness. She was 71 years old. Mrs. Southgate was for many years a director of the Barringer Crater Company, and she wrote a history of the Meteor Crater discovered in Arizona by her grandfather. The publication will be released later this year. For 20 years, she was also a gallery instructor at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. She was born Anna F. Hart in Philadelphia in 1929, and grew up in Princeton, N.J., attending Miss Fine's School, and later graduating from Smith College with honors in 1950. She is survived by her husband, Richard W. Southgate of Manchester; 4 children, Richard W. Southgate Jr. of Essex, Mass, Sarah Barringer Gordon of Philadelphia, Rebecca Southgate of Paris, France, and Jay Southgate of Marshfield, Vermont; and six grandchildren. There will be a small family gathering, but in accordance with her wishes, there will be no public service. The family asks that in lieu of flowers, donations may be made in her memory to either the Hospice of the North Shore, the American Friends Service Committee, or the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.
