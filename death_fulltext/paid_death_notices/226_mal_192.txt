        SARACHEK--Bernard. The Yeshiva University family mourns the passing of Bernard ''Red'' Sarachek, a legendary coach and proud Jew. He led and inspired generations of YU athletes as head basketball coach and athletic director from 1940 to 1969. A revered basketball strategist, he willingly lent his unparalleled expertise to coaches and players throughout the United States and Israel. Red Sarachek has been immortalized at YU through its annual national Jewish high school basketball tournament that proudly carries the ''Coach's'' name. Our heartfelt condolences to his children, Arlene (and Joseph) Weissmann, Esther (and Bert) Blitner, Jules, and Michael (and Jane), his eight grandchildren and three great grandchildren. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel, President Norman Lamm, Chancellor Morry J. Weiss, Chairman Board of Trustees
