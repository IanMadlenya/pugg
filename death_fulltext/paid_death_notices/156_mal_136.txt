        WASSERMAN-Robert A. All of us at Owens Group mourn the loss of our friend and partner. Bob was a unique insurance professional whose advice and counsel were deeply valued by our clients. His dedication throughout the past 33 years has been extraordinarily inspiring. Even when afflicted by illness, he never ceased caring about the interests of his clients and colleagues. We will miss him. We thank his wonderful family for sharing him with us and pray that they will find comfort together with all the mourners of Zion. Herbert and Robert Owens
