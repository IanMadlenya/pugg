        BERNSTEIN-Dorothy. The Board of Directors and staff of the National Association of Family Development Centers, Family Head Start, and Family Day Care, extend their heartfelt condolences to all the bereaved members of the Bernstein family. For 30 years Mrs. Bernstein was the Assistant Director of our agency as she administered to the total needs of families and children of preschool age while simultaneously acting as an inspirational role model to professional co-workers and staff with varied problems. A pioneer worker and builder of the Hebrew Day School movement in the United States, she labored tirelessly for religious Israeli causes and acted as a consultant to many worthy religious and secular Head Start and Day Care projects. Her life emulated her deeds. She will be sorely missed, and her memory will always be etched in our hearts. David Schwartz Chairman of the Board Dr. Alfred Schnell Executive Director
