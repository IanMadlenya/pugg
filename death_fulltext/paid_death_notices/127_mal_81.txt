        ABEL-Reuben. The New School and its Graduate Faculty of Political and Social Science have lost a deeply beloved and respected member on the passing of Reuben Abel. The University extends its heartfelt condolences to his wife, Marion; their children, Richard and Elizabeth; and their four grandchildren. Reuben Abel has been part of our community since 1938. After receiving the Ph.D. in Philosophy at the New School in 1952, he taught for four decades in the Graduate Faculty and other academic divisions. His gifted teaching, animated conversation, and uplifting disposition will be greatly missed. Jonathan F. Fanton, President, New School Judith N. Friedlander, Dean of the Graduate Faculty
