        GLUCK-Melvin C., M.D. The Department of Medicine of New York University School of Medicine notes with sadness the death of our colleague Dr. Melvin C. Gluck. A 1960 graduate of the NYU School of Medicine, resident and Chief Resident in Medicine at NYU Medical Center and Bellevue Hospital, Dr. Gluck was a founder of the Nephrology Division. He served as a Director of the Nephrology fellowship training program and continued to be actively involved in teaching through the course of his illness. His courage and dedication, and the dignity with which he faced his final illness were an inspiration to his many patients, students, and colleagues. Martin J. Blaser, M.D. Chairman, Department of Medicine
