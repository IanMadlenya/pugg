        GOEBEL--Sandy. Respected colleague: a man for whom integrity, manners and patience were the norm, not the exception. For more than sixteen years at BBDO, his clients depended on him unreservedly. In addition to his professional respect, Sandy enjoyed great personal affection. He never took anything for granted. He was a lover of life and devoted to his wife, Doris, and son, Alex. He especially liked to travel to Italy at Christmas and to Saint Barth's. In the same fun-loving vein, he had a beach house in the Amagansett Dunes, that was a great refuge for many years. A coworker once described Sandy at having the best laugh of anyone in the agency. If you made Sandy laugh, you really got your money's worth. We're grateful for having known Sandy. And having heard that laugh. Your friends at BBDO
