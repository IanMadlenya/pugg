        SCHWED--Antonia Holding, 86, died peacefully in her New York City home on September 10. A published novelist, writer and poet, she was particularly well-known for her exceptionally crafted enamel jewelry and wood-based sculptures. The beloved wife of the late Peter Schwed, she is survived by her four children, Kathy, Greg, Laura and Roger, and six grandchildren, Alex, Emily, Sarah, Griffin, Ben and Stephen. We will miss her and love her always.
