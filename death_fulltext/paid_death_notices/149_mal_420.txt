        STAVISKY-Leonard P. The City University of New York deeply mourns the passing of New York State Senator Leonard P. Stavisky, distinguished 1945 graduate of City College, former faculty member and administrator at City College, Brooklyn College, Kingsborough Community College, and Queensboro Community College and former member of the New York City Council. He was an unwavering supporter of accessible and high quality public higher education as chairman of the State Assembly Education Committee and as ranking minority member of the State Senate Higher Education Committee. His vigorous advocacy for CUNY in the Legislature will be long remembered. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Toby, son Evan, and the entire Stavisky family.
