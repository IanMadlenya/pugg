        McNULTY-Edward C., D.M.D. With profound sorrow the faculty, students and staff of The New York University College of Dentistry record the sudden passing of our esteemed colleague, teacher and friend, Dr. Edward C. McNulty. A distinguished educator and clinician, Dr. McNulty served the NYU College of Dentistry as clinical professor and acting chairman of the Department of Orthodontics. He was admired by all who knew him, and will be deeply missed. We extend heartfelt sympathy to his wife, Lynn, and her entire family. Michael C. Alfano, D.M.D., Ph.D. Dean
