        GUERETTE-Donald R., 66. Died July 5 while scuba-diving in Belize, doing what he loved best, enjoying life with his family. He is survived by his loving wife Roberta, his sons Nathan and Marc, his daughter-in-law Katherine, his sister Lee Gidge, his nephews, grandnephew and niece, his sister-in-law and brothers-in-law, many cousins and countless friends. He will also be missed by his dog Max and 3 granddogs. Born in Nashua, NH he was a recently retired Vice President at Time Warner. Don had a laugh that was not only infectious, but thundering and overwhelming. His generosity was more than legendary among his friends and peers and his benevolence was known well beyond his circle. Integrity was not an accessory he wore on convenient occasions, it was an integral part of his constitution. The power of his word more reliable than ink on any contract often shocked and delighted his colleagues. Funeral Mass will be held at Saint Gregory the Great, 144 West 90th Street, Friday July 12, at 11 AM. Memorial reception to follow immediately at Union Theological Seminary, 3041 Broadway at 120th Street. Contributions can be sent to Doctors Without Borders, PO Box 1856, Merrifield, VA, 22116 or National Alliance For The Mentally Ill, PO Box 79972, Baltimore, Maryland 21279-0792.
