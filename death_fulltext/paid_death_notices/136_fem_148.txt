        ZELLER-Belle. The University Faculty Senate of the City University of New York mourns the loss of Professor Emerita Belle Zeller. She was a political scientist by trade and advisor to the administrations of President Roosevelt and Truman and inspiration to generations of students who studied under her at Brooklyn College. Her monument is the numberless graduates who are committed and politically active in virtuous causes. Bernard Sohmer, Chair, The University Faculty Senate
