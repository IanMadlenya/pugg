        STEWART-Albert B., M.D. Age 93, died after a short illness, in Fort Lauderdale, formerly of New York, NY, on Saturday, October 20. He was a wonderful father, and a good-hearted man, who never said a harsh word about anyone. He was a physician, an anesthesiologist, a ''renaissance man,'' whose vast knowledge of so many subjects astounded his family up until the end, as he always had a drop of wisdom to share. He is survived by his second wife, Meri Sherman Stewart, an artist (his first wife and mother of his children was Estelle P. Stewart, a New York City school teacher who died in 1984); his children, Barbara Stewart Consiglio, M.D., & Connie Stewart Slow, M.D., and their husbands, Michael A. Consiglio, M.D., and Jan Slow, M.S.W.; his grandchildren, Gabrielle and Peter, and a sister, Koti Max in Australia. He will be sorely missed and never forgotten. Contributions may be made in his memory to the American Red Cross. Burial to be private.
