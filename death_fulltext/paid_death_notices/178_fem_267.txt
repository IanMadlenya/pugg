        GREENBURGER - Ingrid (nee Gruttenfien). Born July 14, 1913, in Berlin, Germany, died November 25 in New York. Mrs. Greenburger was a painter, writer, literary agent and book scout. She is the widow of Sanford J. Greenburger, the founder of the Sanford J. Greenburger Literary Agency. Her family and many friends mourn her passing. A person of charisma, outspokenness and integrity, no one was unmoved by her. She leaves a place in our hearts no one else can fill. Mrs. Greenburger is survived by her sons, Andre, of Colrain, MA, a photographer, and Francis, of New York, NY, a real estate investor and sponsor of several arts programs, daughterin-law Isabelle, an architect, grandchildren Michael, Holleran, Morgan, Noah, Julia, Claire, and a nephew, Peter Stonehill. A memorial service will be held Thursday, November 29 at 5:00 P.M. at Calvary Episcopal Church, Park Avenue South and 20th Street. Donations may be made to the Ingrid Greenburger Fellowship at Art Omni, 55 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10003.
