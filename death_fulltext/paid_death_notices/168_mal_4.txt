        SCHUSTERMAN - Charles. The Hillel family extends its profound sympathies to our dear friend Lynn Schusterman and her family on the tragic passing of her beloved partner Charles. Charles, the co-chair of Hillel's International Board of Governors, was a philanthropic visionary who believed passionately in the renaissance of Jewish life in the United States, Israel and the former Soviet Union. His support for Hillel helped create a new generation of student, professional and lay leadership. The Schustermans work in the FSU is introducing Jewishness to college students and their families. Charles's warm, personal approach to all that he did will be sorely missed. A mensch and a mentor has left us. His legacy continues through his family and through the lives of countless Jews and people of good will around the world. May his family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Edgar M. Bronfman, Chairman Board of Governors Michael Steinhardt, Co-Chair Chuck Newman, Chair Board of Directors Richard M. Joel, President
        SCHUSTERMAN - Charles. The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) mourns the passing of this dedicated, generous and innovative benefactor. A member of JDC's International Advisory Coucil, together with his wife Lynn, a member of JDC's Board of Trustees, he pioneered new ways of involving young people at home, in Israel and the former Soviet Union, especially his visionary support of Jewish Campus life which sparked the Jewish Renewal Movement. He was involved in Israel in many ways and had a special concern for children at risk, establishing an emergency center in Jerusaleum that served as a model for the rest of the country. We shall deeply miss this wise and caring man and we extend our condolences to his beloved wife and family. Eugene Ribakoff, President Jonathan W. Kolker, Bd Chrmn Michael Schneider, Exec V.P.
