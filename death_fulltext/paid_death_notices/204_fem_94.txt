        DAME--Dr. Enid Sue Jacobs. It is with the deepest regret that we mourn the passing on December 25, 2003 of a poet, editor, teacher, essayist and Jewish feminist whose life and work was a paradigm of character, courage and compassion. She received her baccalaureate from Towson State College, Maryland, her Master's from City College of New York, and her Ph.D from Rutgers University. As a teacher she was revered by her students for her concern and sensitivity. As a poet her work was widely published and anthologized, and her readings well-received and attended. She was considered by several national critics to be one of the ten best Jewish poets in America and was a runner-up for Poet Laureate of Brooklyn. Her last national featured reading was in Ann Arbor, Michigan; her last tristate reading was at Poets and Teachers in Union Square, Manhattan. Her work combined nostalgia and humor with poignancy and purpose. Her early work featured characters such as Lilith, Superwoman and Vilda Chaya, a wild woman who sought counsel from cats and plants even as she climbed down the economic ladder. Enid Dame inherited her political activism and a desire for justice and truth from her parents, the late Morton and Bernice Jacobs. She is survived by her husband, Donald Lev, with whom she founded Home Planet News, which recently celebrated its 25th year of publication. All who knew Enid loved her for her grace, charm, humor and intelligence. She was always glad to meet friends and always went out of her way to support them. She is also survived by her brother, Philip Jacobs, his wife, Lisa and their two daughters Diana and Emily. Adieu mon amie, ma soeur, ma belle. Namaste. Careufel de Lamiere
