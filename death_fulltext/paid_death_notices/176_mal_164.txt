        FOLGER-Jane. The members and staff of Herzfeld & Rubin PC join with our colleague Michael Folger in mourning the death of his mother who perished with his aunt in the unspeakable September 11 terrorist attack on their plane. We pray that he and his family will take comfort in the memory of her love and kindnesses. Herbert Rubin, Sr. Member
