        SHELKAN-Gregor, Hazzan. The Cantors Assembly records with sorrow the passing of one of our founding members, past President, beloved colleague, teacher, friend and tireless worker on behalf of the Assembly and Hazzanut. The possessor of a magnificent voice, he quietly and gently served the spiritual needs of his congregants with dignity, warmth and care. We extend our sympathy to his family and loved ones. May his memory abide as a blessing. Hazzan Chaim Najman, President Hazzan Stephen J. Stein, Executive Vice President Hazzan Abraham B. Shapiro, Executive Administrator
