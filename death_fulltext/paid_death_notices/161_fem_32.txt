        ISAACS-Helene. AMIT is deeply grieved by the untimely passing of our beloved past Director of Programming in America and Israel. A true ''woman of valor,'' Helene Isaacs, in her long Jewish communal service career, taught us all how to love, cherish, and appreciate Torah values, the State of Israel and Yiddishkeit. Her loving kindness, dynamism and caring heart will be missed by the thousands who call her ''a dear friend.'' Shiva is being observed at her home in Israel. Heartfelt condolences to her beloved husband Kim, children Rebecca, Shira and Judah, and the entire family. Sondra Sokal, President Marvin Leff, Executive Director
