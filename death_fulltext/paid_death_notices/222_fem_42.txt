        MARKUS--Marie (Rita). The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn the passing of Rita Markus, a devoted benefactor and friend. With her husband Frits, she endowed a fund for the acquisition of drawings, which they--and after his death, she--continued to support generously each year. Her love for her native country, The Netherlands, and her special dedication to the Metropolitan's Department of Drawings and Prints have enhanced the museum's holdings of Dutch and Flemish drawings enormously. Her grace and generosity will be greatly missed, and we extend condolences to her entire family. James R. Houghton, Chairman Philippe de Montebello, Director Emily K. Rafferty, President
