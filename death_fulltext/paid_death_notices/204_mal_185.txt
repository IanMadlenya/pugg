        GAMBLING -- John. The members of The Nature Conservancy's Mashomack Preserve Board of Trustees and staff wish to express their deep sorrow at his passing, and convey our sympathies to his family and friends. As a former Trustee, he served as Chairman of the Board from 1994 to 1997. He was also for several years a popular, charismatic and very effective auctioneer at our annual Dinner Dance. We are grateful for his leadership, conservation ethic and his generous support throughout the years.
