        SEIDENBERG--Dr. Bernard. With deep sadness we mourn the loss of our esteemed Board Member, Dr. Bernard Seidenberg. We were honored by Bernie's invaluable service to Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center and thus to the community, during a critical time in the history of the institution. He served on the Joint Conference and Compensation Committees and was a member of Boards of the Rutland Nursing Home and Holding Company, KHCF, Inc. In 2004, he received the United Hospital Fund's Trustee of the Year Award for his distinguished service to Kingsbrook. He breathed new life into Kingsbrook with his wise counsel, integrity, kindness, interest and caring for others. We extend our sincerest sympathy and kind wishes to his family. Henna White, Chairperson Board of Trustees Edward Lieberstein Chairperson RNH Board of Directors Linda Brady, MD President and CEO Kingsbrook Jewish Med. Ctr.
