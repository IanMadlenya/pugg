        LEVINE--Joshua. The attorneys and staff of Davis & Gilbert LLP are profoundly saddened by the death of our partner and mentor Josh Levine, a brilliant lawyer, compassionate friend, and loving husband, father and grandfather. A ''lawyer's lawyer'', Josh joined our firm in 1937 and, but for his service in the United States Army during the Second World War, gave his next 49 years to our practice, retiring in 1986. Even then, he would return often to offer his guidance, support and warmth of heart. Once described by Mary Wells Lawrence as the best agency lawyer in the business, Josh was an expert in, indeed he developed much of, the law of advertising. Among his many devoted clients, was William Bernbach with whom Josh formed the advertising company Doyle Dane Bernbach, precursor to todays Omnicom Group Inc. We are deeply indebted to Josh for his professional abilities, his leadership, his vision and integrity, all of which enhanced our practice and greatly enriched our lives.
