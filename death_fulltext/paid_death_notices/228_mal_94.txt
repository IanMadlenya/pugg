        TURNER--David Reuben. On January 6th after a brief illness. Born NYC, December 9, 1915 to Charles and Eva Moscowitz. Mr. Turner was a pioneer of self-study exam and how - to - do - it books, founding Arco Publishing in 1937 and authoring over 300 books. He felt fortunate to have assisted so many people in furthering their education and careers. Proud of his alma mater, City College, and his Bronx roots, Mr. Turner loved watching the sunset over the river from his Croton-on-Hudson home of 56 years. He was a self-described polyglot who cherished a lifelong ambition (nearly accomplished) to speak at least one phrase from every language. A lover of tennis, humor, music, the Volunteer Fire Department, of which he'd been an active member, he is survived by former wife Ann-Louise Perkins Turner, daughters Eve Watters and Ruth Turner, granddaughter Hannah Watters, sister Ruth Ganeless, sister-in-law Jeana Turner, five nieces and one nephew. His loss is especially felt by his devoted long-time companion Gemma Langley and her four daughters.
