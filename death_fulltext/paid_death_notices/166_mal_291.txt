        FIELDS-Louis W. The partners of the former firm of Fields, Fischgrund & Aerenson CPAs mourn the passing of our very much loved partner and friend. Lou possessed a level of competency and technical skills rarely achieved by one in his profession. He combined this with a keen insight into the development of the best of relationships with clients, friends, employees and partners. Our heartfelt sympathy to his beloved wife, Esther, his daughter Jacqueline, his daughter-in-law Gloria and their families. He will remain forever in our hearts and thoughts.
