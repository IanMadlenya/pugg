        WECHSLER-Edith Friedman. Of Westboro, MA. Beloved, precious jewel of all of our lives. Daughter, Sister, Wife, Aunt and Mother like no other. The grace, beauty, charm and wit of a diva. A Saint to those she loved, a tigeress against those who put her loved ones at risk. A lover of nature, flowers, seascapes and all things beautiful. A sophisticated taste for fine foods and a master chef of all things mundane to gourmet. An artist with a passion for oils, water colors and pastels. A reader of all things-of everything. A thinker, a philosopher, a teacher. A devotee of the NYT Puzzle. Not a moment passed that you were not there for us. Your passion for your friends and family will always be unsurpassed. Thank you for your love, your kindness and endless devotion to all of us. Whenever there is a problem, just remember your special day on the boat, and know that not a day goes by without you in our thoughts and prayers. You will live forever in our hearts.
