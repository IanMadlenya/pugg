        KLEIN-Dr. Arthur Luce, born March 31, 1916, to Joseph Klein and Jennie Kallish, in Carbondale, PA, died of a heart attack on April 7, 1997, in New Rochelle. Dr. Klein was an actor, director, and consumate raconteur. He founded Spoken Arts Inc., the distinguished recording company which was among the earliest ventures devoted to the preservation of the voices of contemporary poets and novelists, as well as to literary and educational recordings. Dr. Klein earned his bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. He was a captain in the Army Signal Corps during WWII. Among the beneficiaries of Dr Klein's generous philanthropy were the Sound Shore Medical Center of Westchester, the New Rochelle Boys' Club, and the police and fire departments of New Rochelle, NY. He is survived by his wife Luce; his children, Judith E. Klein of Manhattan, Florence Klein of Santa Barbara, CA, Joel Klein of Baltimore, MD, and Rosine Klein of New Rochelle, NY; seven grandchildren; and his sister Sylvia Meil of Scranton, PA. Services were held at Temple Israel of New Rochelle on Thursday, April 10th. He was a unique personality who touched many with his creative fire, his love, and his courageous insistence to always live to the fullest despite obstacles life offers. We will miss him and we pray that he finds peace and comfort with the Most High.
