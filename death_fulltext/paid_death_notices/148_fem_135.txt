        COLES-Joan C. The members of the Nature Conservancy's Mashomack Preserve Board of Trustees record our deep sorrow at her passing and express sympathy to her husband, children and grandchildren. We are forever grateful to her as a great benefactor, organizer and friend of Mashomack, who served on its board with distinction and who had been an untiring volunteer and generous supporter of Mashomack since its inception, ensuring that it will remain wild and beautiful forever.
        COLES-Joan. The Trustees, Friends and Staff of Inner-City Scholarship Fund extend deepest sympathy to Michael Coles and family in their loss. Joan's generosity and compassion touched the lives of thousands of inner-city children.
