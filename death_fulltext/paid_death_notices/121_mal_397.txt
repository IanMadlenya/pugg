        KIRKWOOD-William C. The Board of trustees, medical board, administrative staff and employees of New York Methodist Hospital mourn the loss of our beloved vice chairman and treasurer, William C. Kirkwood. A member of the board since 1978, Bill's association with the Hospital actually dated back much farther; he was born at the Hospital. He became vice chairman of the board in 1982 and served on the Executive Committee, chaired the Finance and Budget Committee and was a member of many other board committees. In honor of his many contributions, the board of trustees had voted to rename our West Pavilion the William C. Kirkwood Pavilion at its January 1997 meeting. We are deeply saddened that Bill will not be with us at the dedication ceremony. Those of us who were privileged to know Bill Kirkwood will miss his warmth, his friendship and his gentle sense of humor. Those who worked closely with him will miss his untiring dedication and his intelligent, wise and perceptive counsel. All of us at New York Methodist Hospital express heartfelt condolences to Bill's wife, Gladys and to his son, daughter-inlaw and grandchildren.
