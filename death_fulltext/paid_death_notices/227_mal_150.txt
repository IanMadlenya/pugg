        SANDOR - Gyorgy. The House of Steinway & Sons notes with great sadness the passing of the renowned pianist Gyorgy Sandor on Friday, December 9 in New York at the age of 93. Mr. Sandor was a highly valued member of our Steinway Artist family beginning in 1944; a sixty-one year association of which we are enormously proud. A native of Hungary, Mr. Sandor was a pupil of Bela Bartok and he championed the composer's works throughout his illustrious career, both in performance and in acclaimed recordings. He was a featured artist in Steinway & Sons' Centennial concert at Carnegie Hall in 1953, and his devotion to the Steinway piano and to our Company knew no bounds. In addition to his worldwide concert appearances, Mr. Sandor was a celebrated writer and teacher, whose gifted students represent an enduring legacy. He will be deeply missed. To his son Michael and to his family, we extend our heartfelt condolences. Bruce A. Stevens, President Peter B. Goodrich, V.P. Worldwide Concert and Artist Activities.
