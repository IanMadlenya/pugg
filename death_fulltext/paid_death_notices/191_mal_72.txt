        SPIEGEL-Daniel. Our heartfelt sympathy to the family, friends and associates of our esteemed colleague, Dan Spiegel. To his wife Mickey, son Peter, and daughters Jan and Peggy, our sincere condolences and admiration. Dan was a valued member of the Tishman team for more than 25 years.

He was a key player in many of Tishman's most prestigious projects: The World Trade Center, The John Hancock Building in Chicago, Epcot Center in Florida, the renovation of Carnegie Hall and numerous others. We will sorely miss his intuitiveness, creativity and sense of humor. John and Dan Tishman
