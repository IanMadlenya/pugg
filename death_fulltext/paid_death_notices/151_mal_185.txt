        COHLAN-Sidney Q., M.D. KiDS of NYU Medical Center mourns the passing of Dr. Sidney Cohlan. He was a gifted physician and teacher. His wisdom and generosity of spirit inspired us to create this organization. We, together with the countless children and families of KiDS, have lost a wonderful friend, but one whom we will always remember with enormous gratitude and love.
