        GENN--Colman. The Board and staff of the Center for Educational Innovation-Public Education Association are overwhelmed with sadness at the sudden death of its beloved friend and colleague Colman Genn. Cole was a great educator, devoted to improving the lives of all children, especially the children of the poor. He exemplified Tikkun Olam (to repair the world). His generosity was legend. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Brenda and to the entire Genn family. His wisdom and friendship will be missed by all who were fortunate to know him. Seymour Fliegel, President Judy Berkowitz, President of the Board
