        SCHWARTZ NARDI - Shulamit. Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, mourns the passing of a lifelong Zionist and Hadassah activist. From 1931-1933, she served as national president of Junior Hadassah. In 1934, she emigrated to Israel, where she worked closely with Henrietta Szold on Meir Shefeyah, Hadassah's youth village. In the 1940s, she served as editor of the Hadassah newsletter, the forerunner to Hadassah Magazine. In March, 2002, she received Hadassah's prestigious Women of Distinction Award at a Knesset ceremony. She leaves behind an extended family in Israel and in the U.S. May they be comforted among the mourners of Jerusalem and Zion. The family has asked that contributions in her memory be made to Meir Shefeyah, C/O Hadassah, 50 West 58th Street, New York City 10019. Bonnie Lipton, National President
