        SCHLINGER-Shirlee K. She was a teacher and school administrator and an avid bridge and tennis player. Her loving, giving, kind, considerate spirit will live forever in the hearts of her family and many friends. We are sad for our loss, but feel great pride to have had our lives touched by her greatness. We were blessed. She is survived by her husband Sol, her children Andee Jorisch, Robert Schlinger, Lisa Schlinger, her brother Joseph Karroll, and grandchildren Ben and Michael Jorisch.
