        MEARA--Naomi M., Ph.D. The Nancy Reeves Dreux Professor of Psychology Emerita at the University of Notre Dame died February 28 at the age of 70. Originally from Columbus, Ohio, Naomi spent nearly two decades as a member of Notre Dame's Psychology faculty, where she served a term as chair of the department, did research on counseling language analysis and ethics, and mentored countless students. Among her many achievements, Naomi was President of Division 17 of the American Psychological Association in 1988-1989. She was especially proud of her role in advancing the cause of women in psychology. She was a scholar, a teacher, a mentor, a cherished colleague, a devoted sister, a doting and playful ''great'' aunt, a patient listener, a wise counselor, an eloquent speaker, the repository of family lore, and an unconditional friend. She leaves behind her brother and sisterin-law, Joseph F. and Johanna Meara, nephews and nieces Joseph P. (Karen Rebholz), Karen (Jay Bainbridge), Matthew (Kelley), Kevin (Briana Cahill) and Ellen (Ezro Luttmer) and grand nieces and nephews, Rowan, Aidan, Cory, Nicholas, Sean, Audrey, Patrick, Isabel Naomi, Frans and Rose. She also leaves behind a host of loving and devoted friends. We will miss her sharp wit, her calming voice, her curious mind, and her generous and compassionate spirit. Friends may call at the Welsheimer Funeral Home, 17033 Cleveland Rd., in South Bend from 2-6 pm, Sunday, March 4 or in Columbus, OH at the EganRyan Funeral Home, Tuesday, March 6, 3-7 pm.
