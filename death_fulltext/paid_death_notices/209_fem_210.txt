The Reconstructionist Rabbinical College expresses its heartfelt sorrow to her sons, Daniel, William and David, and to her grandchildren, Sarah and Samuel; Anne, James and Leslie; Michael, Ruth, Benjamin, Rachel and Jordan on the death of Dorothy, mother and grandmother. Beloved wife of the late Sidney B. Becker, she was a dedicated Zionist and a passionate supporter of Reconstructionist Judaism in North America and in Israel. She was an active member of the College's Board of Governors, and received the Keter Shem Tov award recognizing her embodiment of Judaism's finest values, unimpeachable integrity, intensive pursuit of intellectual endeavors, and boundless generosity. May the memory of her dedication to klal Yisrael, careful study and the pursuit of a purposeful Jewish life be both a blessing and a charge. Aaron Ziegelman, Gen. Chair; Donald Shapiro, Chair, Bd. of Governors; Dan Ehrenkrantz, President; David Teutsch, Past President
