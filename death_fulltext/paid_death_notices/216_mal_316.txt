        DIAMONDSTONE -- Law rence. We are saddened to have received the news of the passing of Larry Diamond. He was an innovator in his approach in marketing in his business. He was a cocontributor to the founding and sustaining of Millmar Paper Sales. A man of his word always, his guidance and stewardship towards Millmar will never be forgotten. Once there were four and only one remains. He feels no more pain because now he is with his Father in heaven. May Hashem bring him close. May his light always shine in the memories of those who are near to him and knew what he was truly about. We humbly offer condolences to his family for their loss. God looked around his garden and found an empty place, He then looked down upon the earth and saw your tired face, he put his arms around you and lifted you to rest, God's garden must be beautiful, He only takes the best. He knew that you were suffering, He knew you were in pain, He knew that you would never get well on earth again. He saw the road getting rough and the hills were hard to climb, so He closed your weary eyelids and whispered, ''Peace be thine.'' It broke our hearts to lose you, but you didn't go alone, part of us went with you, the day God took you home. If tears could build a stairway and heartaches make a lane, we'd walk a path to heaven to be with you again. The Feldman Family
