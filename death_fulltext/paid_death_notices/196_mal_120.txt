        KRIEGSMAN-Jack. The Officers and Directors of the Public Schools Athletic League Memorial Fund regret the untimely passing of our co-director. Jack was a leader in the field of health and physical education. He served as an exemplary Assistant Director of the Public Schools Athletic League for many years. As our co-director, he was recognized as a ''man for all seasons'' and the conscience of high school athletics in the New York City Public Schools. Most of all, his every professional effort was aimed at improving life for the students whom he served. The Board expresses its heartfelt sympathy to his dear wife Selma and his daughters and grandchildren. We will all sorely miss him. At the request of the family, memorial scholarship donations may be made in his memory to the Jack Kriegsman Scholarship at the PSAL Wingate Memorial Fund, C/O Heisman Foundation, Downtown Athletic Club, 19 West St., New York, NY 10014-1006. Services will be conducted on Thursday, May 15 at 12:00, at the Menorah Chapel, 2145 Richmond Ave, Staten Island. 718-494-7700.
