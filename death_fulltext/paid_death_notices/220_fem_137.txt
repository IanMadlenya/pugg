        FARKAS--Ellen Tanner. The American Jewish Committee is profoundly saddened by the death of Ellen Farkas, a cherished member of AJC's National Leadership Council and a generous supporter who gave of herself with heart and soul. She endowed AJC's Ellen and Benjamin Farkas Fellowship to expose young leaders to the Jewish public policy agenda and strengthen their commitment to the Jewish community.
