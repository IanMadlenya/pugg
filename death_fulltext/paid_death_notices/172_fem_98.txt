        SAIMOVICI-Adelina. On Friday, May 4, (retired) pharmacist in Romania and Israel, after a long illness. She is survived by her son Liviu B. Saimovici, MD, Ophthalmologist in Manhattan. She was loved by all as she touched their lives with her kindness and beautiful smile. She will be sorely missed! Heartfelt thanks to my fiance, Amy; to Maria and all of those who supported us during the difficult times. Love Always, Liviu
