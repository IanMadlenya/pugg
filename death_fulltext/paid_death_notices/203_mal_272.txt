        RUSSELL--Thomas W. Jr. The Board of Directors of the Metropolitan Opera Guild mourns the passing of their esteemed Board member, Thomas W. Russell Jr. Tuck joined our Board in 1970 and served for many years with great distinction on our Executive, Audit and Pension Committees and as Chairman of our Merchandising Committee. During the last few years, he was a member of our Emeritus Board. His energy, wisdom and candor will be sorely missed. We extend our sympathies to his daughters, Jennifer and Sarah, and his son, Tom.
