        STEINER-Lee N. The members, attorneys and staff of Loeb & Loeb LLP mourn with profound sadness the loss of Lee N. Steiner, our partner for more than 40 years. A towering figure of international renown in the entertainment industry, Lee was a pioneer in the practice of entertainment law. Lee was an inspiring leader within the firm, an outstanding mentor and a great friend. We enjoyed his warmth and humor and greatly admired his dedication to his family, his clients and a myriad of philanthropic endeavors. We will miss him dearly. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his beloved wife, Roz, his cherished daughters, Cathy, Terry and Nancy, and the entire Steiner family.
