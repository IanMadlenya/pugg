        SHEREFF-Henry David. The Directors and members of the Townsend Harris Alumni Association are deeply saddened by the death of Henry Shereff, a founder and past president of the Alumni Association, and a member of the Townsend Harris Hall of Fame. Gentle, kind and generous, Henry Shereff was one of the driving forces behind the re-opening of Townsend Harris as a leading public high school in New York. To his wife, Meta, and their three sons and granddaughter we send our love and condolences. Those wishing to contribute to a scholarship fund being established in his memory may do so by sending a check to the Townsend Harris Alumni Association, Box 1274, Gracie Station, New York, NY 10028.
