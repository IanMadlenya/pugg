        TRESCHER -- George. The patients and staff of the AIDS Care Center of the New York Presbyterian Hospital mourn the passing of our friend. George was very wise in the ways of New York. After taking our program to heart more than a decade ago, he shared that wisdom to nurture our growth. We will miss his loyal support and counsel. Jonathan Jacobs, M.D., Executive Director Samuel Merrick, M.D., Medical Director
        TRESCHER -- George. George, you were our mentor, teacher, and friend. Everything we know, we learned from you. You challenged us and expected nothing less than one-hunderd precent. Nobody will ever replace you. We are honored to have known you and blessed for having had the opportunity to work for you. We loved you and will miss you.
