        KANAREK-Adele. We extend sincerest condolences to Dr. Irwin Kanarek on the loss of his beloved wife, Adele. To anyone who had the good fortune of knowing her, she personified dignity and elegance and was a source of happiness and joy. She was an active board member of the National Women's Division for many years. As Silver founders of the ''Hospital With a Heart'', the Kanareks played a vital role in helping to provide state-of-the-art and compassionate care to the people of Jerusalem. May Irwin and the entire family have warm and loving memories of this very special, caring individual. May they be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
