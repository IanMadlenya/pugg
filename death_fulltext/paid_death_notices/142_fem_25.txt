        BUZDOVACIC-Damira. Nov. 1, 1998. Loving daughter, sister, aunt & friend to all who came into her path. Exceptionally gifted, deeply religious & profoundly benevolent, she left us too young and too soon. Her guiding light and generosity of spirit will be dearly missed. May she rest in peace. A Memorial Mass will be held Saturday, Nov. 7 at Church of Notre Dame, 405 114th St. at Morningside Drive, NYC, at 9:45 AM. All are welcome. Buzdovacic Family and her Loving Friends
