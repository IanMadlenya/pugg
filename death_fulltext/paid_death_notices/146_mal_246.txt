        ALPERT-Leonard B. Of Briarcliff Manor, NY, on March 9, at age 68 died, as he wished, quickly and quietly in his own bed at home after a brief heart-related illness. Despite the physical limitations of quadriplegia and part time dependency on a respirator because of polio contracted in 1955, Lennie lived a life full of the realization of his goals and visions. His 26-year career at Sears Roebuck was marked by achievements in the early years of data processing and systems development. In 1980, he and his wife Marie opened Images Art Gallery in Briarcliff Manor. Both at Sears and at Images, he was mentor and friend to so many whose lives were touched by the quiet grace, dignity and incredible sense of humor with which he lived. He died just one day after his childhood hero, Joe DiMaggio, and the words which described the elegance of the athlete could well apply to Lennie. He will live on in the hearts of all whose lives he touched, but mainly in his wife Marie Pantuosco Alpert who has never known where she began and he ended and in his nephew Larry Friedman, his niece Ellen Friedman, their spouses Holly Holmes and Jeff Cowan; great nieces Rachel, Celia and Molly; great nephew Sam and sister and brother-in-law Blanche and Jack Friedman. A memorial service is planned for a later date.
        ALPERT-Leonard B. A wonderful friend and a loyal America. Lenny was brilliant, sensitive, courageous, perceptive and irrepressibly optimistic. The world of art will mourn your passing, as will the citizens of Briarcliff Manor, for many years to come. Love Alice, Stanley, Deborah and Eric.
