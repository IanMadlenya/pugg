        DINSTEIN-Haim. The American Friends of Tel Aviv University mourn the passing, in Israel, of Haim Dinstein, the beloved father of the President of Tel Aviv University, Professor Yoram Dinstein. Haim Dinstein was a distinguished Israeli lawyer who practiced law until his 90s. During his youth in Russia he was an ardent Zionist leader and was imprisoned for his Zionist activities. He came to Israel from Russia in 1924 and was one of the founding fathers of the pre-State Jewish community in Palestine. He was a man of great virtue and integrity who along with his wife, lived exemplary lives and bestowed upon their children a love of decency and a great respect for humanity. Our heartfelt condolences to his wife, sons, daughter, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. The American Friends of Tel Aviv University Bernard Rapoport, Chairman, Board of Directors Melvin S.
