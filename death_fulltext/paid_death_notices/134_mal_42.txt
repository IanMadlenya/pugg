        LEVY-Walter. The Officers, Board of Directors and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Walter Levy, a generous and ardent supporter of UJA-Federation. He was a dedicated leader and cherished friend of the Long Island Jewish community who served as Chair of our Rockville Centre Community Campaign, and as a member of our South Nassau Cabinet. We extend our deepest sympathies to his beloved wife, Beatrice; his 2 sons, Peter and Ronald; and his 2 grandsons, Jacob and Benjamin. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair Louise B. Greilsheimer, President Martin Rosenman, Chair, Long Island Cabinet Stephen D. Solender, Exec. V.P.
