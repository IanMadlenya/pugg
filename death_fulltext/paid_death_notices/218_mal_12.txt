        POLLITT--Basil R., 85, born December 26, 1919 in Huntington, WV, died February 25, 2005 in Brooklyn, NY, of a cerebral hemorrhage. Harvard 1940, Army Air Corps 1942-45, Columbia Law School 1948. Of his many legal and political activities, Basil was proudest of his service to the United Electrical Workers, his defense of Steve Nelson, Andy Onda, John Killian and others during the McCarthy era, and his many decades of work for civil liberties and social justice. His meticulously researched brief demonstrating the unconstitutionality of racial and gender discrimination in grand jury selection helped lead to the reform of the system by which grand juries are chosen. In his later years he developed housing cooperatives for people of modest means. The beloved ''mayor'' of Sidney Place, he enjoyed gardening, reading, researching family history, dinner at The Queen, and helping his many friends and neighbors with their legal issues. Predeceased by his wife, Leanora Levine, survived by his daughter Katha, granddaughter Sophie PollittCohen, brother Daniel, sister Betty Kenney, companion Marlyn Klee, in-laws Zeena and Harry Kassel and thirteen nieces and nephews. ''While there is a lower class, I am in it; while there is a criminal element, I am of it; while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.'' In lieu of flowers, donations would be welcomed to the Rosenberg Fund for Children or Berea College (KY). Memorial service April 2, 2 PM at Grace Church, 50 Grace Court, Brooklyn Heights.
