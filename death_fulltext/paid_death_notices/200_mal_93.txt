        JOSEPH--Paul R A wonderful and devoted husband, son, stepfather, grandfather and friend, left us much too soon, at age 52 on September 6, 2003 in Plantation, Florida. Paul leaves behind his adoring wife, Dr. Lynn Wolf, his loving stepchildren, Brian and Nikki Kopelowitz and Jill Kopel and Skimmer Hellier, his beloved granddaughter Abigail Kopelowitz, and his loving parents, Lawrence and Joany Joseph and Charles Brittin. Paul was predeceased by his mother, Barbara Acoff Brittin. Paul graduated from Goddard College, earned his JD from UC Davis and his LLM from Temple University. Since 1984, he has served as a faculty member and Associate Dean of International and External Programs at Shepard Broad Law Center, Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale. Paul served as President of Florida ACLU and on the ACLU National Board. He was a Trustee of Goddard College for many years. Paul, whose warmth, intellect and refreshing lack of cynicism earned the devotion of friends from all over the world, gave Lynn and their family fifteen profoundly happy years together. Donations in Paul's memory can be made to The Shepard Broad Law Center of NSU, the Florida ACLU, American Cancer Society or National Public Radio, as you wish.
