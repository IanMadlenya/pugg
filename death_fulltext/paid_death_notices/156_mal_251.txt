        ABBELL-Joseph J. The Jewish Theological Seminary family records with sorrow the death of longtime friend and supporter, Joseph J. Abbell. An exceptional man with a kind word for everyone, Joe loved his family, his Judaism and his community. Devotion to JTS was a family affair reflected by Joe's generosity, that of his late brother Max and that of his daughter Louise Holland who serves on the library board of overseers. Our hearts go out to daughter and son-in-law, Louise and J. William Holland, grandchildren, Ethan and Elizabeth and the entire family. May his memory be for a blessing. Ismar Schorsch, Chancellor Gershon Kekst, Chairman
