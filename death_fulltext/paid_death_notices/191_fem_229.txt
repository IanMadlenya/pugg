        MALTZ-Ann. Passed away peacefully on December 24, 2002 in Boca Raton, Florida after a long illness. Her loving husband Albert and her adoring children Debra Goldberg and Richard Maltz were at her side. She leaves a legacy of love and kindness to them and to her grandchildren Lauren, Peter, Adam and Matthew and to her son-in-law and daughter-in-law Walter and Nancy and to the countless family members and friends whom she generously showered with her warmth and affection, her boundless energy and wit, and her unfailing willingness to listen and always to help. She will be long remembered and greatly missed. In lieu of flowers the family suggests that contributions be made to the charity of your choice.
