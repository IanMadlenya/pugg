        PRICHEP-Annette. With great sorrow, we mourn the passing of our beloved mother, devoted grandmother, mother-in-law, sister, sister-in-law, aunt and dearest friend. Having fought a two-year battle with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, she succumbed peacefully at home on Saturday, August 1. A role model of strength, dignity, elegance and love, she will be missed immeasurably. Her impact on the lives of all who knew and loved her immortalize her memory. In lieu of flowers, please send contributions in her name to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Lymphoma Service, for the research of Dr. A. Goy. Services today at 11 AM at ''The Riverside,'' 76th and Amsterdam.
