        STRAUS - Gwendolyn. The Yeshiva University family mourns the passing of the beloved wife of the late Joseph Straus, of blessed memory, who was a kind, gentle, loving mother, and an active leader in many organizations on behalf of Israel and Jewish education, including valiant service as a respected member of the Board of Directors of our own Stern College for Women (SCW).

(and Zahava) Straus, YU Benefactors, Trustee of Yeshiva University and its affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS), and Chairman of the Board of Directors of our Azrieli Graduate School of Jewish Education and Administration (AGS), who established the Joseph and Gwendolyn Straus Chair in Talmud at RIETS and the Gwendolyn and Joseph Straus Chair in Jewish Education at AGS and SCW in her honor; Yeshiva College Board of Directors member, Daniel E. (and Joyce) Straus, YU Guardians who, together with Moshael and Zahava Straus established the Joseph Straus Kollel Fellowship at RIETS; Bethia Straus (and Paul Quintas); and Adina (and Dr. Jeffrey) Rubin; sister of Annette Renick of Florida, and beloved grandmother of thirteen loving grandchildren. May the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University Ronald P.
