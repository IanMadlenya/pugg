        LUXENBERG-Herbert. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) deeply mourn the loss of Herbert Luxenberg of Cleveland, a generous and dedicated leader of the ATS. Chair and immediate past president of the Cleveland Chapter, Herbert, along with his wife Mickey, demonstrated their deep commitment to the ATS, the Technion and Israel by attaining the rank of Technion Guardians. They established the Herbert and Marianna Luxenberg Academic Chair in the William Davidson Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management, and helped fund numerous regional projects initiated under Herbert's leadership such as the Cleveland Creative Design Student Laboratory Fund; Northern Ohio Chapter Mathematics Incubator Fund; and the Elton B. Katz SelfStudy Multimedia Library, part of the Luxenberg Center for Self-Study in the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Mickey and the Luxenbergs children, brothers Leonard and Norman, and the entire Luxenberg family.
