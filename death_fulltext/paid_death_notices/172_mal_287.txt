        GRYNBAUM - Bruce B. The Trustees, Faculty and Staff of NYU Medical Center mourn the passing of Bruce B. Grynbaum, MD, a distinguished physician and educator in the grand humanist tradition. Dr. Grynbaum emigrated to this country from Eastern Europe moments before W.W. II shook the world as he knew it. After earning his medical degree at the Columbia College of Physicians & Surgeons in 1943, he completed residencies at The Mount Sinai Hospital and Goldwater Memorial Hospital in his chosen specialty-clinical rehabilitation medicine. During more than 50 years of outstanding service to our institution, he ascended rapidly to positions of leadership. He was Clinical Director of Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine and Vice Chairman of the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine at NYU Medical Center from 1984 to 2001, as well as Professor of Clinical Rehabilitation Medicine at NYU School of Medicine. His humanitarian activities spanned the city and the globe. In 1987, he spent months treating Armenian earthquake victims-just one example of his generous, caring spirit. Dr. Grynbaum was one of a kind. He was a remarkable man and a superb physician who will not be replaced. Kenneth Langone, Chairman NYU School of Medicine Foundation Board of Trustees Robert M. Glickman, MD, Dean NYU School of Medicine Theresa A. Bischoff, President NYU Hospitals Center
