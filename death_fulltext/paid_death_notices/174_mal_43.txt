        RUBINSTEIN-Benjamin, Dr. Died peaceably and courageously on July 2. He was a devoted and loving husband of Irene for over 65 years. He adored his sister Shirley, and an inordinately proud father of Larry, Peter and John. Loved by his daughters-in-law Robin, Kerry and Blair. He saw his future in his grandchildren Mara and Jeff Tanzman, Eve, Michael, Noah, James, Jill and Adam Rubinstein. He relished being a great grandfather to little Noah. Of strong constitution and opinions, he served as a caring dentist to generations of patients and maintained loyalty to the Educational Alliance and Surprise Lake Camp for their support of his growth and development in his youth. As a proud and loving Jew, he supported the state of Israel from its birth and always cared about the well being of synagogues. His memory will be a blessing.

        RUBINSTEIN-Dr. Benjamin. Surprise Lake Camp mourns the loss of Dr. Benjamin Rubinstein. This extraordinary man had a fierce love for Surprise Lake Camp that lasted his entire life. He started as a camper in 1922, went on to be a member of the staff, and served on our Board of Directors for 37 years, where he was a tireless champion of the camp's scholarship tradition. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife Irene, to his three children Peter, John and Larry, and to his grandchildren.
