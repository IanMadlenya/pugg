        SHEFFER--Ralph. The Board of Trustees and Staff of the Westport Public Library mourn the passing of our dear friend, Ralph Sheffer. His leadership of the Library while serving on the Board of Trustees from 1982 to 1990 and his Presidency from 1989 to 1990 provide inspiring memories to us all. His commitment to the Library and its central place in the community were unparalleled. We will miss him, and we extend our heartfelt sympathy to his family. James D. Seymour, President Westport Public Library Board of Trustees
