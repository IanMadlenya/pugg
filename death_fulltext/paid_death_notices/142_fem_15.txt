        GALLEN-Betty. Daughters of Miriam Center/The Gallen Institute, a long-term care and rehabilitation facility located in Clifton, NJ, lost a close friend and benefactor with the passing of Betty Gallen. A champion of the elderly and steadfast supporter of the Center, Betty and her husband Herbert, endowed the subacute program. In recognition of their generosity, the facility is named The Gallen Institute for Subacute Care. Currently, the 36-bed unit is undergoing an expansion. At the conclusion of the renovation, the state-of-the-art institute will be able to accomodate 66 patients and will serve as a model in the delivery of subacute services in northern New Jersey. Betty Gallen's legacy will serve as an inspiration to the many lives she touched.
