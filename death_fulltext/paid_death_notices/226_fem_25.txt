        BRADY--Helena Real. Age 75 passed away Wednesday, November 2, 2005 at her home in St. Augustine, FL. Helena was an extraordinary person. She was a model of courage, decorum, integrity and honesty. The list of her academic awards and accomplishments is too long to recite here, but they range from the Fordham University Gold Medal for ''leadership, scholarship and character'' awarded to the outstanding graduating senior to inclusion in Who's Who. She conducted worldwide tours for students at Pace University in New York City where she was a professor of political science, international relations and history. She was dedicated to her students and was known as the ''go-to'' professor if a student had academic or even personal problems. Students not even in her classes would seek her out for counsel and advice. Helena's excellence in teaching was recognized when she received a university award for excellence in teaching. She did not confine her contributions to just the classroom. She was also very active in community service, serving on youth boards and in county agencies that helped the poor and needy, including the Red Cross where she achieved lifetime membership. Helena truly had a compassionate, full and active life, one which will surely earn her a place in heaven. Helena is survived by her loving husband, Gene Brady. Helena's family will receive friends Saturday and Sunday between the hours of 5-7 PM at Craig Funeral Home. A funeral mass will take place Monday at 9 AM at St. Anastasia Catholic Church.
