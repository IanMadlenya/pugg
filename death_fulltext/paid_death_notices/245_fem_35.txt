        BRIGHENTI--Laura, born October 2, 1954, Desio, Italy; died New York City, April 27, 2007, after a painful battle with cancer. Beloved wife of Peter Homel and devoted mother of William, she will be greatly missed by family, friends, and colleagues. No flowers: contribute to a cause fighting cancer or stupidity. ''E pur si muove''.
