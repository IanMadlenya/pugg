        KASINDORF--Stella. Age 77, on August 13, 2004 in Norwalk, CT, after a long illness. Beloved wife of Ira Kasindorf, mother of Barry and Mark Kasindorf, grandmother of Alan and Evan Kasindorf, sister of Martin Sobelman and Mickey Tolkov. Her warm smile and bright intelligence enriched all who knew her. A long time resident of Weston, CT, she was for many years the Treasurer and a board member of the League of Women Voters of Weston, CT. She will be sorely missed.
