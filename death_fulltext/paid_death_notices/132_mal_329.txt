        LYDGATE-William A. The entire family of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center mourns the passing of former Trustee William A. Lydgate. A former Chairman of the Earl Newsom & Co. public relations concern, he was named Trustee of the Year by the NYS Hospital Trustees Association in 1986. The ''quintessential trustee,'' he was a revered and distinguished leader of our institution and will be sorely missed. To his wife Cynthia and his family, we offer our profound condolences. Lawrence S. Huntington Chairman of the Board Ronald C. Ablow, MD President Richard P. Fried, MD President of the Medical Board
