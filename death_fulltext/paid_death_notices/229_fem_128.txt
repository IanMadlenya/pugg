        MEYERS - Judith. The Trustees & Staff of Jewish Child Care Association are deeply saddened by the untimely death of Judy Meyers, Director of JCCA's tutoring program, Two Together for 11 years. Under her leadership the program grew from one site to four; the number of children & tutors doubled; parents became even more involved in their children's learning & Judy communicated her passion for teaching & learning to a new generation of young people. Her colleagues at JCCA, Two Together tutors, families, & most of all, the children who learned not only to read, but to love books will miss her terribly. Our heartfelt sympathy to Judy's husband, Howard & her whole family. Leonard Elman, President Barbara B. Mann, Chair Richard Altman, CEO
