        MEHLMAN--Benjamin Wm. The Members of West End Synogogue, along with the entire nationwide Reconstructionist community, express our very deepest regret at the loss of Judge Mehlman. Bill was the embodiment of Reconstructionist Judaism. Retaining his scholarly passion for text study, Bill became more liberal, open minded and all-embracing as he aged. His original thinking, his courage and passion for generous inclusivity into the tents of Abraham far surpassed the sentiments of many younger thinkers. With his twinkling blue eyes, he was loveable, funny, swift as he was stubborn and, while his teaching and spirit will remain with us always, we will miss his all-weather attendance at Shabbat services in his usual place in the West End sanctuary, on the left side of course. Our warmest sympathies go to Bill's three daughters and their families, and to all those to whom he was so very dear. West End Synagogue, A Reconstructionist Congregation Rabbi Yael Ridberg Cantor Mordechai Schram Pres. Janet Rosenberg
        MEHLMAN--Benjamin Wm. Along with his words intoning our new status as husband and wife when he and our two rabbis married us, we will hear his many words of wisdom and have before us his endless examples of how best to live our life together. Our love to all his dear ones. Donald & Jane Weprin Menzi
