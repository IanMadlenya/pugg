        SHECHET--David, beloved father, grandfather, and husband of the late Jean Shechet, died peacefully at his home in Manhattan on February 15, 2007. He was a man of great integrity, brilliance, generosity, and faith. David's personal and philanthropic generosity was known to many but was never done for public acclaim. He was especially proud of being a founder of the Central Queens YM & YWHA and the Young Israel of Forest Hills. His love and wise counsel will be dearly missed by his children, Arlene and Arthur and their spouses Mark and Marilyn, his grandchildren, Sonia and Will, and Ben and Ellie, his friends, and all who knew him. He and Jean had homes in Forest Hills, New York, and Delray Beach, Florida. His funeral will be on Sunday, February 18, 2007 at 9:30 am at Riverside Memorial Chapel on 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue in Manhattan. Contributions in his memory may be made to the Visiting Dr. Service at Cabrini Hospice, 227 East 19 St., NYC 10009.
