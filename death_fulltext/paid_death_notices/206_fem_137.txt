        HACKETT--Dr. Elizabeth. 73, of New York, NY, and Cannes, France, passed away on March 8, 2004. A graduate of the Fieldston School and Radcliffe College, Dr. Hackett received her Ph.D. from Harvard. In 1969, she joined Pfizer Pharmaceuticals where she made major contributions to the development of drugs in Pfizer's Central Nervous System Program, with her most noteworthy contribution on the anti-depressant Zoloft. In addition, she was the primary clinician for a number of Pfizer clinical trials and contributed to many publications. After retiring from Pfizer in 2001, Liz split her time between her apartments in New York, where she volunteered at the Museum of Natural History and Cannes, France, where she volunteered at a local library. Predeceased by her beloved husband John, Liz is survived by a close knit family of cousins from the New York area, present and former Pfizer co-workers, and many others on both sides of the Atlantic. A memorial service will be held in her honor on Friday, March 19, 2004, at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street at 3:30 PM, in the Madison Room.
