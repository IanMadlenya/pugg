        POLSKY--Howard W. All of Elem/Youth in Distress in Israel, staff, Board of Directors, professionals, colleagues, students, and friends in both Israel and America are deeply saddened by the sudden loss of Howard Polsky. Many of us have known and loved Howard since the beginning of Elem in 1982. Besides caring personally for him, and considering him our longtime friend, his professional interest and knowledge, his continuous involvement in all the important issues of Elem, and he and his wife, Ronni Berger's generous use of their professional expertise to positively expand the knowledge of so many Elem youth and Elem staff in Israel, all of this cannot be replaced. Howard was a distinguished educator, researcher, and author. We and the whole social work profession benefitted from his many books, such as the classic, ''Cottage Six, The Social System of Delinquent Boys in Residential Treatment.'' He made major contributions to the social work field and shared his immense knowledge regularly to better the lives of many Israeli troubled youths. He will be greatly missed, but often remembered by his lifetime of contributions to the field. Ann Bialkin, President
