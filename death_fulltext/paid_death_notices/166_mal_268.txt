        FEUER-Phillip. The officers and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the untimely passing of Phillip Feuer whose life embodied the world of our values and the compassion of our mission. As a member of our Commission on Jewish Identity and Renewal and our Westchester Business and Professionals Group, he was a beacon of righteous deeds and Jewish community leadership. His dedication to those in need was as passionate as his devotion to his family. Our deepest sympathies go to his loving wife, Sarene Shanus; his two teenage daughters, Rose and Abigail; his brother, Marvin; his sister, Susan; and the extended Feuer & Shanus families. May all who benefited from Phillip's kindness and wisdom be consoled among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. James S. Tisch, President Larry Zicklin, Board Chair Marion Blumenthal, Chair, Commission on Jewish Identity & Renewal John S. Ruskay, Exec VP & CEO
