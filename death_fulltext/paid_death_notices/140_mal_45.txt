        MANN-Jonathan, M.D., M.P.H. We, the Board of Directors and staff of the American Foundation for AIDS Research, mourn the loss of our valued colleague, friend, and Director Emeritus who stood passionately and fearlessly on the front line of the global fight against HIV/AIDS. His leadership in marshalling an international response to the AIDS pandemic has challenged the world to acknowledge the link between public health and human rights, between the well-being of society and the well-being of the individual. Today, we thank him for his vision and his guidance, and we rededicate ourselves to the mission he so bravely championed.
