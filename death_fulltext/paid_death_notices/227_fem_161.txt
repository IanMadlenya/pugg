        HUNT--Cathi Morgan. December 25, 2005, age 66, of New York, NY. She died after a brief hospital stay following a fall and a fractured pelvis. Her passing was quick and she suffered little, comforted by her family. Beloved mother to two sons, Kevin and Ron. She is also survived by her mother, brother, sister, and four beautiful grandchildren. A lifelong learner, she was a graduate of Cornell University '59, Columbia Business School '78 and was a passionate Consumer Affairs professional. She was truly blessed to have so many friends throughout her life. Her great love was for the City of New York. In lieu of flowers, expressions of sympathy can be made in her memory to Lutheran Social Services--LSSNY, 475 Riverside Ave., New York, NY 10115 which helps thousands in the City every year. She will be sorely missed.
