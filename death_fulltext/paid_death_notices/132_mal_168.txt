        BRUCKER-Manuel. The Management and Staff of TotalTel USA Communications, Inc., with great sorrow, mourn the passing of our Founder and former Chairman. He planted the seed from which the company has grown to a successful and respected participant in the exciting world-wide telecommunications industry. He was a true friend, mentor and inspiration to all of us who have had the pleasure of working with him. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to the entre family, most especially his wife, Carol, who endured the suffering of his last years. May his memory be a blessing.
