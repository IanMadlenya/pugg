        WITKIN-Shirley. We are deeply saddended by the death of Shirley Witkin. As a philanthropist and a member of a noted philanthropic family, her generosity was essential in creating North Shore University Hospital's Julia and Israel Waldbaum Dialysis Center. She was also an admired member of the hospital staff. We extend our deepest sympathies to her family. Saul Katz, Chairman, Board of Trustees North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System
