        REILLY--Conor. The partners, associates and staff of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP mourn the tragic and untimely passing of Conor Reilly, our friend and partner in the firm's New York office. Conor was well known and highly respected in the legal community for his brilliance, energy and wit. He was an exceptional lawyer whose legal skills knew no bounds. He was as comfortable closing a corporate deal as he was litigating a court case, and later in his career, he became a leader in the New York bankruptcy bar. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife Margaret and his two children, Kate and Mike. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP
