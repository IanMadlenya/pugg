        DANA-Bessie. The Trustees, Faculty and Staff of Mount Sinai School of Medicine and The Mount Sinai Hospital of Mount Sinai NYU Health deeply mourn the passing of our dear friend and esteemed colleague, Bessie Dana, MSW, Professor Emerita of the Department of Community and Preventive Medicine, who was associated with Mount Sinai for more than three decades. An expert in developing collaborations and team interrelations, Professor Dana contributed in a major way to the integration of medicine and the social components of caring for people. She was responsible for the design of medical education for the Department of Community Medicine, working with all departments and divisions in the medical school. She will be sorely missed. We extend our sincerest smypathy to her sister, Helen Schless and other members of her family. A memorial is to be planned in the near future. Helene L.
