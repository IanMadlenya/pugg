        SPIEGEL-Motoko Ikeda. We regret to advise the community that Motoko Ikeda Spiegel passed away suddenly on February 14, 2000 at the age of 72. She was the loving wife of Si Spiegel and devoted mother of Kazuko Ono, Ray Spiegel, and Tamio Spiegel. She leaves five loving grandchildren and a saddened community. Motoko was an artist in oils, woodblock prints, and photography. A 1978 graduate of SUNY Purchase, she was a tireless advocate of the rights of mistreated peoples, particularly Japanese-Americans who suffered internment during WWII and the Ainu people of Northern Japan. She was a generous, caring, and nurturing friend to many artists and activists. A Memorial Service celebrating Motoko's life will be held on Saturday, February 26 at the Nippon Club, 145 West 57th Street, NYC. A selection of Motoko's artwork will be on display at the Nippon Gallery there from February 24 through 26. In lieu of flowers, the family requests contributions to the Motoko Ikeda Spiegel Memorial Fund, 10 W. 66th Street, NYC 10023.
