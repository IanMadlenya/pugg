        PARKS - Gordon was so much to so many people, he became an Icon of his time. He was a beloved figure of multiple talents, but at ICP we knew him principally as a photographer. Cornell Capa included him with seven other photographers in his book ''The Concerned Photographer II'' published in 1972. We hosted a solo exhibition of his work in 1975, and included his work in exhibitions in 1974, 1983, 1988, 1989, 1993, 2003-2005. His spirit, his drive, his passion will inform our lives for as long as we can remember, and for that we are humbled and grateful. We express our sorrow at his passing, but venture to say that he will always be with us in his dignity and in his ability to connect with and express the human soul. Willis Hartshorn, Director Cornell Capa, Founding Director Emeritus For the Staff and Board of the International Center of Photography
