        KOGEN--Rabbi David C. The Joint Retirement Board for Conservative Judaism notes with profound sorrow the passing of Rabbi David C. Kogen, a trustee since 1959. He headed the Nominations Committee for many years, served as Board Chairperson in 1989 and 1990, and was instrumental in arranging a high quality retirement savings plan for rabbis, cantors, executive directors, educators and support staff of synagogues and agencies of Conservative Judaism. Rabbi Kogen will be greatly missed but his memory will be a blessing. Our condolences are extended to Dena, his devoted wife of 58 years, and his children. Rabbi Matthew H. Simon, Chairperson Nina Rone, CPA, C.O.O.
