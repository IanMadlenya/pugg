        COX--Donald M. The trustees and staff of the American Federation of Arts are deeply saddened by the loss of our dear friend and Vice President of the Board, Donald M. Cox. We will be forever grateful for his many contributions and immense generosity to the organization during his 26 years as a member of the Board, five as Board President. He was a man of integrity and thoughtfulness who cared deeply about art. His philanthropy, including the New Initiative Fund he established for the AFA, was visionary as well as munificent. He will be greatly missed. We extend our sincere condolences to his wife, Maria, and his nieces and nephews. Gilbert H. Kinney, Chairman Frank B. Bennett, President Julia Brown, Director
