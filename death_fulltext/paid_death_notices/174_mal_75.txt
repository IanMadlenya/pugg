        RADDOCK-J. Joseph. The administration, faculty and students of Florida Atlantic University and the Board of Directors of the FAU Foundation express their deepest sympathy to the family of Dr. J. Joseph Raddock, a member of the Board of Directors since 1990. An enthusiastic supporter of FAU, he and his wife Sharon provided funds for FAU's Raddock Eminent Scholar Chair for Holocaust Studies, The Sharon Phillips Raddock Professorship in Holistic Nursing and a scholarship endowment for the Honors College. We are greatful for his leadership and commitment to FAU, and his untiring efforts on behalf of higher education.
