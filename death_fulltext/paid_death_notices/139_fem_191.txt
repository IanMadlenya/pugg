        NACHMAN-Charlotte K. on August 28, 1998, peacefully at home at age 101. Beloved wife of the late Arnold N., who died in 1943. Survived by her daughter Marjorie and son-in-law Howard Rosenthal; son Richard and daughter-in-law Sarah Gifft; grandchildren Ann, Ruth, Jesse, Elizabeth, David and Eric; six great grandchildren; and by her devoted care-givers Maud Morgan and Ruby White. Charlotte arrived in America from Hungary at age five with her mother and two brothers. Orphaned four years later, she grew up in the Hebrew Orphan Asylum, where she remained until she was 18. She graduated from Hunter College in 1918 and later was a remarkable elementary school teacher in the NYC public schools for almost 40 years. Not content to just ''retire,'' she learned Braille so that she might translate books for the blind. Then, for some 30 years, as a volunteer at the Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged on West 106th St., she created and directed a library for the residents. Charlotte will be missed and lovingly remembered by many. A memorial service will be held later.
