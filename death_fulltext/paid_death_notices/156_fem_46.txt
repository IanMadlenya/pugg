        LIPPMANN-Zilla. The New Dramatists Community of Playwrights, Board members, staff and friends deeply mourn the passing of our President Emerita, Zilla Lippmann on December 27, 1999. Zilla was our guiding spirit over three generations. Through the John Golden Fund, named for her beloved uncle and mentor, Zilla fostered the support and production of new American playwrights in New York. She made possible the purchase of New Dramatists' beautiful home on West 44 Street, a mecca for playwrights from around the world, giving hope and inspiration to hundreds of theatre artists. She was a writer's champion for much of the 20th century. We will miss her always. Our heartfelt condolences to her daughter, Jill Allgauer, and to her grandchildren Sarah, Dina and Jorg, and to her friends and colleagues everywhere, and to her fellow Board members of the John Golden Fund. New Dramatists will host a memorial service for Zilla on Wednesday, January 19th at 5PM. In lieu of flowers, contributions in Zilla's memory may be sent to New Dramatists, 424 W. 44 St, N.Y., N.Y. 10036.
