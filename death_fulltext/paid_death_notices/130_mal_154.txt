        HOCKNEY-Donald J., Ph.D. The Board of Trustees, President David C. Chang, the faculty, alumni and students of Polytechnic University mourn the passing of their colleague Donald J. Hockney, professor of computer science and humanities. During his 21 years at the University, Dr. Hockney was a major force in enhancing Polytechnic's reputation as a research university. He held prominent leadership positions, including vice president for strategic initiatives, vice provost for academic computing and director of Advanced Software Kinetics. He helped build Polytechnic's well-respected computer science programs and counseled many young faculty members on how to obtain research funding. An accomplished scientist who had also earned a doctorate in philosophy, Dr. Hockney believed that college was a time for students to stretch their intellectual boundaries and study diverse subjects. Professor Hockney was an inspiration to those who worked and studied with him. We will sorely miss his presence, fellowship and dedicated service and extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Helen; son, Richard; and daughters, Sarah and Tanya. Services at 10:30 A.M., Monday at Cobble Hill Chapels, 171 Court St., Brooklyn.
