        DAVIS--Doris Rosenbaum (Dee Dee), 87, author and artist extraordinaire, died peacefully at home on June 14th. Her loving and beloved children, Laurie Gilkes and Peter Davis, her adored and adoring grandchildren Amy Gilkes Loe and Conner Davis, and her dear grandson-in-law Brad Loe miss her already. Fabulously feisty, she was surrounded by people who loved and respected her. She lived by her father's oft-quoted words, ''Let nothing disturb the harmony of your thoughts''. A memorial service is being planned. The family will be receiving guests at Dee's home on Sunday and Monday. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Visiting Nurse Service of NY Hospice Care and to Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center.
