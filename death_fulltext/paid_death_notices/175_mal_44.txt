        SEGALL-Arthur A. The Attorneys and Staff of Loeb & Loeb LLP deeply regret the passing of our former partner Arthur A. Segall. Arthur was a long-time name partner of Hess, Segall, Pelz, Guterman, Steiner & Barovick, which merged into Loeb & Loeb in 1986. Arthur was a dean of the tax certiorari bar in New York and was a distinguished figure within our office for more than sixty years. We extend our deepest sympathies to his son Matthew, daughter Ann and the entire Segall family.
