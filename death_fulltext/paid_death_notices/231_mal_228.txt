        STONE--Robert G. The Flag Officers and Trustees of the New York Yacht Club note with sorrow the passing of former Commodore Robert G. Stone, Jr. Commodore Stone played a central role in the club's leadership for over 40 years. He was Commodore from 1981-1983 and served as Chair of the Nominating Committee from 1988-2003. In 2003, he was awarded the New York Yacht Club Medal, the club's highest honor. Our warmest thoughts are with his wife Marion and his family at this sad time. George R. Hinman, Jr. Commodore
