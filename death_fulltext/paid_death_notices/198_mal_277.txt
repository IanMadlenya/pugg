He did publicity for the WPA and worked as an advertising executive for Metromedia and Winston Network, retiring at the age of 80. He loved music, politics and his New York Times. Dad, we loved you so much and miss your humor, wisdom, kindness and concern for your family and the family of man, your sense of fairness and almost childlike wonder of the world. >>AD#
