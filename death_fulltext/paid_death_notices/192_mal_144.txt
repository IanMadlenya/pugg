        MATHER - John R. The American Geographical Society family mourns the death on January 3rd of Russ Mather, whose friendship, sound judgement, and devoted service to the Society have been invaluable. As a Councilor from 1981 through 2000 and Secretary from 1983 through 2000, he earned the gratitude, respect, and affection of colleagues and staff. In 1999 the Society awarded him the Charles P. Daly Medal, established in 1902 for ''valuable and distinguished geographical labors.'' He will be long remembered as one of the stalwarts who loyally supported the Society in difficult days and rejoiced in its growing strength. We will sorely miss him. John E. Gould, Chair Jerome E. Dobson, President Mary Lynne Bird, Exec Dir
