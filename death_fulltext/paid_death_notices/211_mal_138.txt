        KELLY--George A. Msgr. In an age of 'the Ordinary' how refreshing it became for many of us to meet 'the Extraordinary.' Such was the dynamic priest, George Kelly. Not unlike his own mentor, John Monahan, he found himself in his younger days on the front lines of the struggling labor union movement. Soon thereafter, he graduated to confront the siege situation of the American family by launching the National Catholic Family Movement. In his final chapter, no less colorful than earlier ones, he entered the fray battling for the minds of a nation's young on the blackboards of America's Catholic Universities by awakening leadership to the treasury of learning in Aquinas and the tenets of Catholic Scholarship! He founded the Fellowship of Catholic Scholars. The landscape of our lives is measurably diminished! Heaven favor his journey home! William B. O'Brien
