        BAUMEL-Claire, 71, of Delray Beach, FL, on April 1. The members of Women's American ORT are deeply grieved over the death of Claire Baumel, an Honorary Vice President who was the embodiment of public service for more than 40 years. Passionate and vibrant, an inspiring personality and speaker, Claire was an active member of the national leadership, serving as Vice President, Chairwoman of the National Organization Subcommittee, National Financial Secretary and NAtional Treasurer. In her work for ORT, she traveled extensively throughout the United States and abroad, conveying her fascination with ''an organization devoted to freeing people from hopelessness through education.'' We extend our loving sympathy to Claire's husband, Win, her children, Mally, Jeff and Ellin, and her grandchildren, Brian, Danny and Matthew. A memorial fund in memory of Claire will be established at Women's American ORT, 315 Park Avenue South, New York, NY 10010. We will sorely miss her.
