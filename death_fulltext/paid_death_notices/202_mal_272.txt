        KLEINER -- Eugene. The Board of Trustees, administration, faculty and students of Polytechnic University mourn the passing of Eugene Kleiner, an alumnus, trustee and a 1989 Honorary Doctorate of Engineering recipient of the University. As a founder of Fairchild Semiconductor, the first successful company to manufacture the silicon-based transistor, and later a founder of the venture capital firm of Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield and Byers, which launched over 300 companies, Eugene Kleiner's enormous contributions to the field of information technology are legendary. Among the many honors bestowed upon him, Eugene was inducted into the Silicon Valley Business Hall of Fame, and in 2000 was named Outstanding Mechanical Engineer of the Century by Polytechnic University. His gentle humor and generous spirit will be very much missed. Our sympathies are with his son, Robert, and daughter Lisa Kleiner Chanoff and their families. Stewart G. Nagler, Chairman David C. Chang, President Polytechnic University
