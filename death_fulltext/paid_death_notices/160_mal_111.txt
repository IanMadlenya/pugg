        SHORR-Jay. The members of the New York Psychoanalytic Institute and Society mourn the loss of their revered and beloved colleague, Dr. Jay Shorr. He was a training and supervising analyst who was valued as a teacher, mentor and clinician. The combination of kindness, along with his teaching skills, made him very sought after by our students. During his tenure as Chairman of the Educational Committee he instituted many important reforms. He also served for many years as associate director of our Treatment Center. We will miss his wise and benevolent counsel. We extend our sincere condolences to his wife, Cynthia Shorr, and his children, Nicholas and Emily. There will be a memorial service held at a date to be announced. Contributions in his memory may be sent to the New York Psychoanalytic Institute Foundation. Albert M. Sax, M.D. President/Society Eslee Samberg, M.D. President/Institute
