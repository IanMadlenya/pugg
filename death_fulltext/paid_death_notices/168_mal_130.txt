        READ-Dr. David H.C. We mourn the death of our founding VicePresident, Dr. David H.C. Read. A voice of conscience and compassion, he was an invaluable colleague in our work on behalf of religious freedom. We recall his lasting contributions on our missions to Northern Ireland, the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia in pursuit of justice, peace and tolerance. To his beloved wife Pat and son Rory, and the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church community, our deepest sympathies. Appeal of Conscience Foundation Rabbi Arthur Schneier, President Rev. Joseph O'Hare, S.J., V. Pres. Steven J. Dorn, Sect.-Treas.
