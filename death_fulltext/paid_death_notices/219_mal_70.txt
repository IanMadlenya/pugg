        BACOT--J. Carter. The New York Philharmonic mourns with deep sadness the loss of our dear friend, J. Carter Bacot, who served on the Philharmonic's Board of Directors for 16 years. Mr. Bacot was an extraordinarily committed director, who was steadfast in his devotion to the orchestra. His leadership and wise counsel will be sorely missed. He chaired the Finance Committee, served on the Executive and Nominating and Governance Committees, and participated generously in all of the organization's fundraising activities, including chairing its Opening Night Gala. Most importantly, he loved the orchestra and enjoyed many wonderful concerts in Avery Fisher Hall. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Shirley, and his daughters, Elizabeth and Susan. Lorin Maazel, Music Director Paul B. Guenther, Chairman Zarin Mehta, President and Executive Director
