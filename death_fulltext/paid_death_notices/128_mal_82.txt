        RUDOLPH-Paul. The board, officers and staff of the Architectural League of New York mourn the passing of the eminent architect, Paul Rudolph, a longtime member of the League. Paul Rudolph influenced generations of architects in the United States and abroad through his leadership of the Yale School of Architecture from 1958 to 1965, and through his powerfully sculpted built forms and masterful drawings. He is remembered with respect and admiration. Walter F. Chatham, President Rosalie Genevro, Exec. Director
