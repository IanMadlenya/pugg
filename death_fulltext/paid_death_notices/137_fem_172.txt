        STEINDECKER-Erna. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Els Bendheim and the Steindecker family on the loss of their beloved Erna. To anyone who had the good fortune of knowing her, she was a source of happiness and joy. Mrs. Steindecker was a righteous woman who personified the qualities of elegance, grace and extraordinary dignity. Throughout her life she exemplifed the values of intergrity, kindness and modesty and was ever-faithful to the legacy of the Bendheim-Salomon-Steindecker families' devotion to Am Yisrael, Torat Yisrael and Eretz Yisrael. May the family have warm and loving memories of a very special and caring wife, mother and grandmother. May they be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
