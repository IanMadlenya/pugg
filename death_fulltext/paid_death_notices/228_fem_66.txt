        LEVINE--Frances, February 18, 1916-January 1, 2006. Our beloved mother, grandmother and great-grandmother, passed away leaving us without our head cheerleader and maven on life, love and politics. Now she is with her beloved Irving and we'll just have to listen harder to hear her pearls of wisdom and laughter. Memorials may be made to Team Bobby JDRF 121 2nd St., San Francisco, CA 94105. Love Claire, Pete, Rebecca Anne, Bob, Christopher, Rebecca Sharon, Bobby, Anniepie, Danny and Henry
