        BOELZNER--Gordon. Peter Martins and the dancers, musicians, staff and Board of Directors of New York City Ballet deeply mourn the passing of Gordon Boelzner, a pillar of the Company for over 45 years. Gordon joined the Company as a rehearsal pianist and later became a conductor and an acclaimed solo pianist, performing at the premieres of such works as George Balanchine's ''Ballade'' and ''Robert Schumann's Davidsbundlertanze,'' and Jerome Robbins' ''Dances at a Gathering'' and ''The Goldberg Variations.'' He was named Music Director in 1990 and held that position until he retired in 1999, then assuming the title of Music Advisor, which he retained until the time of his death. Gordon was admired for his exceptional intelligence and sensitivity, his wit and immense charm, as well as for his great wealth of musical knowledge and his consummate professiona lism. His devotion to George Balanchine and to New York City Ballet was a source of inspiration to all who worked with him and his remarkable presence in our family will be greatly missed. We extend our sincere condolences to his brother, Gary, and sisterin-law, Joyce.
