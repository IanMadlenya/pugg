        LEVITT--Mortimer. On July 12, your great and courageous heart could no longer sustain life in you. During the 98 years you spent on this earth you were known as merchant prince, philanthropist, producer, author, and above all as a confirmed iconoclast. You wanted to live to 104, but you will live much longer because we will carry forward your vision and your dreams. Your wife Mimi, your daughter Elizabeth, and your son Peter, will miss your strong presence and your wonderful sense of humor. You influenced the lives of many people with your intelligence, your creativity, your exquisite taste and your zest for life. We will celebrate your remarkable accomplishments and your extraordinary spirit at a memorial tribute a la Mortimer in September. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be sent to Young Concert Artists, 250 West 57 St., New York, NY, or Friends of the Levitt Pavilion, 85 East Holly St., Pasadena CA. 91103. To receive information about the memorial service send an email to: MortimerMemorial@aol.com
        LEVITT--Mortimer. The Writing Center at Marymount Manhattan College notes with sadness the passing of our great benefactor and dear friend, Mortimer Levitt. Mortimer once observed that ''Endless troubles are the price we must all pay for the gift of life. There are no exceptions,'' and he urged us all to adopt his motto and philosophy ''Keep smiling,'' to best deal with the absurdity of the situation. To his wonderful wife, Mimi, his great love and guiding spirit, and the rest of his family, we send our deepest sympathies. Lewis Burke Frumkes, Director
