        HAMBURGER-Anna Matson. The Board of Directors and staff of the International Rescue Committee note with great sorrow the passing of our dear retired colleague, Anna Matson Hamburger. As a director of our operations in Europe for many years after World War II, Anna worked with energy, compassion and resourcefulness to help thousands of refugees from Soviet Bloc countries resettle in the United States. Subsequently, as a leader of the American Jewish Philanthropic Fund, she played a vital role in resettling thousands of additional refugees. On behalf of the Board and staff, we extend our condolences to her family. Winston Lord James C. Strickler, M.D. Co-Chairmen of the Board George Rupp, President
