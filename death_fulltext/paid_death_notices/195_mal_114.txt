        SMEAL-Frank P. The Board and staff of the Greater New York Councils, Boy Scouts of America mourn the loss of Frank P. Smeal, Eagle Scout, our former President, our generous and consistant supporter and, most importantly, our friend. His generosity and leadership has had an enormous impact on the lives of thousands of children and will be fondly remembered and continue to serve as an example to us all; he will be dearly missed. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the Smeal family during this difficult time. John F. McGillicuddy, President Daniel R. Gasparo, Scout Executive
