        REICHMAN-Julian. The American Jewish Committee is deeply saddened by the passing of Julian Reichman, past national vice president and honorary member of AJC. Recipient of AJC's Institute of Human Relations Award in 1980, we will remember him for his tireless hands-on dedication to community service, and will miss his unrelenting optimism and humor. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Genie; his daughter, Nancy; his son, John, and the entire family. Bruce M. Ramer, President Shula Bahat, Acting Exec. Dir.
