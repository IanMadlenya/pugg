        SHASHA-Maurice. My eldest brother. Circumstances forced him to become the head of the family and the family's business at the young age of 21. A very decent and honorable man. Lived in several countries and adjusted well everywhere. Will be sorely missed by me and the rest of the family. His good memory & accomplishments will remain with all of us. Alfred A. Shasha
