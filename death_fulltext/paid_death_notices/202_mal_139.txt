        PORDY--Leon, M.D., F.A.C.C. 84, died Friday, November 14th, 2003 at his home in Manhattan after a valiant battle with a long illness. His accomplishments were bountiful. Graduating Phi Beta Kappa from NYU in 1938, he went on to receive a Master's in Biochemistry prior to attending Louisiana State University Medical School where he graduated first in his Class of 1943. He was an incredibly remarkable person and received humanitarian awards as well as alumni recognition awards from Mt. Sinai, authored a world famous computer electrocardiography textbook, penned countless articles published in prestigious medical journals and served as Captain and Head of the hospital in Udine, Italy during WWII. Even more so, he had two completely diverse careers as he was Chairman and CEO of Chock Full O'Nuts for 10+ years along with his medical career at Mt. Sinai and was brilliantly successful at both. He is survived by his wife, Ruth, three children, Dr. William, Dr. Robert, and Melissa Pordy, daughter-in-law, Dr. Cathryn Devons, and three grandchildren, Rachel, Jessica and Matthew Pordy. Services will be held on Sunday, November 16th, 2003, 11 AM, at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Ave. at 81 St., NYC, 212288-3500.
