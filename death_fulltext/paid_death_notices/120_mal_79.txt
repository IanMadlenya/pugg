        MURPHY - Eugene E. D.D.S. On January 3, 1997. Loving and devoted husband of Bernadette . Dr. Quentin M. Murphy, Malcolm S. Graham, and Robert J. Doherty mourn the passing of our dear friend and colleague. Gene was the most dedicated of professionals whose demanding standards of practice were an inspiration to us all. His innate ability to combine his wit and good humor with his consummate skills as a practitioner brought joy and light to all those fortunate enough to have made his acquaintance. We record with profound sorrow his passing - his like will not soon be forgotten.
