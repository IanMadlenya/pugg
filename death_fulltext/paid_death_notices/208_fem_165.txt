        BALSAM--Joy. We mourn the passing of our friend and colleague, Joy Balsam, a woman of extraordinary energy and spirit. Joy's passion for Jewish life, and her high standards of excellence, inspired us all. We will miss her. May her husband, Jerry Balsam, and the rest of her family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. The Trustees and Staff of Avi Chai
