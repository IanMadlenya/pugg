        WEINER-Josephine. The National Board of the National Council of Jewish Women is deeply saddened by the loss of a distinguished leader and dear friend, Josephine Stern Weiner. As NCJW President from 1967-1971 she set an extraordinary example by her dedication to improving the lives of women, children and families here and in Israel. During her presidency, NCJW published ''Windows on Daycare'' a groundbreaking study of the severe lack of quality, affordable childcare in the nation, and launched RIFIE, NCJW's Research Institute for Innovation in Education at Hebrew University. Under her leadership NCJW became a founding member of Women in Community Service (WICS), an interfaith coalition that finds meaningful employment for women living in poverty in urban centers. A respected civic leader in her hometown of Detroit, a series of lectures on volunteerism at Wayne State University bears her name. Jo's dynamic leadership and her loving kindness will remain an inspiration to NCJW and everyone she touched.
