        SCHILD-Alice. On Jan. 13, 2003. It is with great sadness that our family marks the death of Alice Schild, sister of Marge and Bob LeVine and Lore and Mel Mallin, loving aunt of many nieces and nephews. She was a world traveler and a business woman who lived and died her way. She will remain in our hearts forever. Donations to Make a Wish Foundation.
