        GREEN -- Stanley Joseph, Ph.D. In profound sorrow we mourn the loss of husband, father and grandfather who died on August 10, 2004 at age 84 in Palo Alto, CA. Devoted husband of Alice (Denenholz). Beloved father of David, Douglas and Ronald. Grandfather of Andrew, Joshua, Ashley, Matthew and Kevin. He was Director of the Steam Generator Project Office, Nuclear Power Division, at the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) in Palo Alto, CA which he retired from in 1991. From 1954 to 1977 he worked at the Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory of Westinghouse Electric Corporation. Dr. Green worked on the Manhattan Project during WWII. His work in the area of heat transfer advanced the applied technology for steam generators in nuclear power plants. Though he was a wellknown authority in the heat transfer field, he will be most remembered by his family and friends for his integrity, ethics and quest for knowledge. Graveside services Sunday, August 15, at 1 PM, King Solomon Memorial Park, Dwaslane and Allwood Rd., Clifton, NJ 07012
        GREEN--Stanley. A kind and gentle friend. Our love and sympathy to Alice, David, Ronald and our adored son-inlaw Douglas. Edwina and Marvin Marks
