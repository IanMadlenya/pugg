        BARISH--Murray, 94. Died peacefully in his Manhattan home early Tuesday morning. Predeceased by his cherished wife of 71 years, Sylvia, he personified the American dream. A Polish immigrant, he arrived in this country at nine years of age and was orphaned at 13. On his own he had the confidence to build a highly respected textile business. More importantly, his honesty, generosity and strong family values instilled a legacy for his adoring family to follow. He will be greatly missed by his children, Marilyn and Mel Manin, Joan and Al Chasen and Carl and Rose Barish, his 7 grandchildren and 10 plus great-grandchildren. The pain of losing him is eased by the knowledge that he is at peace beside his beloved Sylvia. A graveside service is planned for Thursday, November 9 at 1 P.M. at Sharon Gardens Cemetery, Valhalla, NY.
