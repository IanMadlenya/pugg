        GONZALES-Felicitas. On December 18, 1999. Mrs. Gonzales's friends and co-workers at New York Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia Presbyterian Center, send their heartfelt condolences to the Gonzales family. Mrs. Gonzales, who worked at the Hospital for more than 30 years, was supervisor of the core laboratory. She has tragically been taken from her family and from us. We will miss her greatly.
