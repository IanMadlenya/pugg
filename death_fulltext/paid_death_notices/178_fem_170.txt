        WEXNER-Bella. We join with world Jewry in mourning the loss of Bella Wexner, a wonderful friend of the Pardes Institute of Jewish Studies in Jerusalem. Through her special efforts, Jewish educators from Columbus, Ohio have been able to enrich the depth of their experience and learning and that of their students through study at Pardes. Her legacy will continue to be a shining example of dedication to Jewish education and values. Rabbi Daniel Landes, Director and the Board of Trustees of the Pardes Institute of Jewish Studies
