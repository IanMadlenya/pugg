        UHLAND-Werner. The Meltzer family and the employees of Triangle Building Products Corp. deeply regret the passing of an old friend and former associate. Our heartfelt sympathies are extended to his wife Jean and the rest of his family and friends. He was a man of distinction and integrity who will be missed by all who knew him.
