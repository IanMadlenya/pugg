        QUINN--Charles C. It is with deep regret that the Realty Advisory Board announces that its former chairman, Charles C. Quinn, died on October 20, 2005. Mr. Quinn was associated with the Realty Advisory Board and the real estate industry for 27 years providing guidance, direction, and support to all who worked in the industry. He was invaluable in contract negotiations offering insight and understanding to achieve mutually beneficial goals. His warmth, his humor, and his genorosity of spirit will be missed.
