        LESSER--Ruth, Ph.D. The Interpersonal Orientation of the New York University Postdoctoral Program in Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis deeply mourns the loss of Dr. Ruth Lesser, our beloved colleague and friend, a woman who spearheaded the Interpersonal movement at NYU and championed its tenets throughout her long and distinguished career. Dr. Lesser was a feisty advocate and untiring supporter of freedom, individuality, and the influence of culture on human development. In her work, a positive blending of compassion with confrontation, she made seminal contributions to the understanding of the enduring effects of sibling attachments on later interpersonal relations. She was unique and the likes of her shall not pass this way again.
