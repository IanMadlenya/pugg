        MOORE -- Joseph Adrian Clairmont, 76, passed away peacefully on March 15th. He leaves behind the legacy of a loving family; Mary Somers Moore, his sister Patricia Ryan, his children Christopher Somers Moore, Frederick Clairmont Moore II, Mary-Elizabeth Ward Moore, Anne Clairmont Moore, and Alison Moore Harris, his longtime companion Bernard Baxter, his grandchildren Emerson Moore, Timothy Moore, their mother Juliet Faber Moore and his son-in-law King Harris. Early on, he learned firsthand the rudiments of international business from his Canadian father, Frederick C. Moore, who joined the fledgling General Motors Corporation during its formative years. Mr. Moore retired from a career that spanned four decades of successfully resolving a wide variety of public relations challenges. During his career at Eaton Corporation, he pioneered the broad multinational corporate approach to doing business when he spearheaded the corporate communications staff. In 1971, Moore edited PR Quarterly's two issue special on multinationalism --then a brand new word coined by Business Week. He later established Moore & Company, whose clients included Prudential-Bache Securities, Brunschwig et Fils and numerous non-profit foundations. His love of history and antiques manifested itself in his last endeavour, Moore & Company Antiques. A memorial service will be held on April 21st, 10:30 AM, at St. Thomas More Church, 89th Street between Park and Madison Avenues. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to Calvary Hospice, New York.
