        PETERSON-Esther. Consumers Union, publisher of ''Consumer Reports'' Magazine, mourns the death of Esther Peterson, a great woman, and a great consumer leader and activist. During her entire life, Esther served the public interest: in the women's movement, the labor movement, and the consumer movement. Fighting for a good cause filled her with energy and happiness. She was a strong leader and ally: you couldn't fool her, you couldn't scare her, you couldn't stop her when she was fighting for what she believed in. As Consumers International's representative to the UN, she lobbied the UN successfully to adopt the UN Guidelines for consumer Protection. They've become the basis for many consumer protection laws around the world, especially in Third World Countries. In the process, Esther became a standard-bearer for the world consumer movement at the UN. Her death is a great loss to her country, to the consumer movement and to all her causes. James Guest, Chair, Board of Dir Rhoda Karpatkin, President Consumers Union of U.S.
