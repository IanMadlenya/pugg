        BARNETT-A. Doak. The Board of Directors, Members, and Staff of the National Committee on United States-China Relations mourn the passing of A. Doak Barnett, esteemed colleague, distinguished scholar, and dear friend. A founding member of the National Committee, Professor Barnett helped guide us over the past 33 years, serving as Chairman 1968-1969, Director, and most recently Vice Chairman. His wisdom, knowledge, spirit, and friendship will be profoundly missed.
