        LEE-Francis (Francesco-Sardo-Fontana), age 85. Rare pioneer of independent and avant-garde film. As an official wartime cameraman, he survived the second wave of D-Day landings on Omaha Beach. He used the footage in one of his best known works, ''World War II and Me.'' His footage of the Liberation of Paris so thrilled Charles de Gaulle that he was given a Croix de Guerre. Much loved and missed by friends and family, he will be remembered for his inspiration, determination and tremendous courage. Survived by son, Michael West Lee. Service Wednesday June 3, 11AM, Krtil Funeral Home 1297 First Avenue.
