The Members, Directors and Officers of The Soldiers', Sailors', Marines' and Airmen's Club deeply regret the sudden and untimely passing of their great friend & benefactor, William Willis Reese, on 29 December, 1999. Self-effacing, quietly generous to a degree unparalleled, Bill could not help himself but help those less fortunate. A deep sense of loss has now become reality to all of us who knew him. And all of us at SSMAC send our deepest condolences to his widow, Sonya, and his family. R.I.P. Ivan Obolensky, President
