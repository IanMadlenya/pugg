        BERGER--Esther and Bernard. Each 92 of New York, loving husband and wife of 53 years, died two days apart. They were the wonderful parents of daughter Terri and son-in-law Jerry and grandparents of Sarah. They expanded the lives and horizons of many people in their long careers with the City of New York--Esther as a social worker and teacher and Bernie as Director of Training and Development, who was admired in his profession for his high standards and integrity. They enjoyed art, music, literature and intellectual discussion, but are best remembered for their kindness and compassion. They will be sorely missed.
