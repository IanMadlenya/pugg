        AMMON-R. Theodore. The board, staff and artists of Jazz at Lincoln Center are profoundly saddened by the death of our chairman, R. Theodore Ammon. Ted was a great and loyal friend of this organization, since joining the board in 1996 and becoming chairman in March of this year. A tireless supporter, Ted brought his passion for jazz and his tremendous enthusiasm for our mission to everything he did. His strong belief in the power of jazz to bring all kinds of people together will remain a source of inspiration. We all loved him very much, and he will be sorely missed. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his family and friends. Wynton Marsalis, Artistic Director Bruce MacCombie, Exec. Director
