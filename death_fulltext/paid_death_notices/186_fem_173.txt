        BLOOMBERG-Florence Ehrlich on July 29, 2002 at home in Manhattan. She reveled in life, and loved her family and friends and they, in turn, adored her. Her children, Jane and Peter, Alice and Michael; her grandchildren, Craig and M.J., Karen, Wendy and Liza; her great-grandchildren, Nicholas, Claire and Owen; and her ''Sister Natalia'' will miss her vivacious spirit and ''Auntie Mame'' qualities.
