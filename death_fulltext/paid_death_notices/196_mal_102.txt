        MOORE-Bishop Paul, Jr. For many New Yorkers, Episcopal Bishop Paul Moore, Jr., was, from his consecration as Bishop in 1969 until his recent death, in a real sense the Spirit of the City. A courageous and highly decorated former Marine, he was also a priest with a deep faith in the one holy, catholic and apostolic church, which faith called him to challenge the injustices he saw around him. The Episcopal lay men and women of the Church Club of New York note with deep sorrow the death of their Bishop, who for so many years was the conscience of New York City.
