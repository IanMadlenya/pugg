After being honorably discharged, Mrs. Blueweiss returned to New York, married twice and had four children. She settled on Long Island in 1955 where she and her husband Murray lived and raised their three children; her eldest daughter Susan died in 1994. A devoted mother, she returned to the work force as a customer service manager in order to help put her children through college and law school.
