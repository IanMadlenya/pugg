        SCREVANE-Paul R. He came to the side of the walking-wounded young of this Town and their anguished families 35 years ago when New York was in tumult and darkness about drugs and kids. He brought the weight of City-concern as Deputy Mayor and never left our side over these years. No one stands so tall as when he bends so low to lift a child to hope & recovery. The Board, Staff and legions of the young of Daytop Village mourn his loss as we return his Soul to a God who favored such a noble calling. Our prayerful support for his family. (Msgr.) William B. O'Brien President, Daytop Village, Inc.
