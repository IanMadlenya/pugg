        STRAUSS--Gideon, 89, on February 26, 2005 in NYC. An extraordinary, multi-faceted man -banker, diplomat, art collector, musician -his rich life spanned most of the 20th century in Europe, Palestine/ Israel, and New York. Arriving in Palestine from Europe in 1935, he spent 13 years with the Anglo-Palestine Bank; he later opened the first New York branch of Bank Leumi Le-Israel. In 1948 he came to New York, and was immediately recruited to work for the new State of Israel, which he served as Consul for two years. From 1966 to 1999, he was a senior officer at Rosenthal & Rosenthal, a private finance company, where he created a subsidiary devoted to art financing. He completed and published his memoir in late 2004. Predeceased by his wife of 45 years, Renate Cale Strauss, he is survived by his devoted children Yair, Noa, Sharon (Mark), Eran (Geula) and Adin (Yoko); loving grandchildren Namane, Goapele, Nave, Eli, Ari, Naomi, Aya, and Reina; beloved partner Eva Popper; brother Peter Ettlinger; relatives and friends in Israel, Europe and the US. Plans for a memorial service will be announced later. A truly special person of immense intellectual curiosity, his death leaves a huge vacuum in the hearts of those who loved him. But we are grateful to have had the joy of sharing his life for so many years. ''We shall not see his like again.''
