        ROSENBERG-Sylva. Passed away Thursday night. Sylva was the loving and devoted wife of Louis. She was the beloved mother of Meir Rosenberg and Sue Thau. She is the cherished grandmother of eleven and great-grandmother of two. Sylva posessed a kind and gentle soul while maintaining great strength and character. We will dearly miss our precious Sylva.
