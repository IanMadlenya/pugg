        GREENHAUS-Edwin. Died July 20, 1999. He was born on April 3, 1932. Most of the time you could find my brother sitting in front of his store. This store was his temple. He lived in it and he died in it. His life was his prayer. My mother and I miss him more and more every day. We choose to remember his birthday rather than the day he died.
