        SCHWARTZ--Rabbi Gershon. The Jewish Theological Seminary community mourns the sudden and tragic death of Rabbi Gershon Schwartz, loving husband of Dr. Shuly Rubin Schwartz, Dean of JTS's List College of Jewish Studies. Rabbi Schwartz attended the undergraduate program at JTS and was also ordained at the Rabbinical School of JTS. A beloved rabbi, he served in the pulpit for many years in Long Island and Pennsylvania, in addition to being a Judaic scholar, author and teacher. Rabbi Schwartz' passion for conservative Judaism, Israel, the Hebrew language and all things Jewish inspired everyone who knew him. His intelligence, warmth and wit will be missed by all. We extend our heartfelt and deepest sympathy to Shuly, Tali, Hadar, Moshe and Aviva and the extended Schwartz family. May all be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Ismar Schorsch, Chancellor Gershon Kekst, Chairman
