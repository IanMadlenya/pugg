        HAGEMAN-Rev. Dr. Lynn L. Forty years ago, Dan Wakefield, in his striking challenge to the conscience of this Town, issued his poignant narrative of crushing poverty and abandonment on just one City Block, 101st Street off First Avenue. It was his 'Island in the Sun.' One figure stood almost alone in the dust of that Block's agony, Rev. Lynn Hageman. And Exodus House, the by-product of that Block's agony, stands so proudly as a monument to Lynn's indomitable spirit in holding out the branch of safety when droves of the abandoned, addicted young were being swept downstream. Will we ever see his like again? Alexander Pope in his 'Essay on Man' wrote: ''Who sees with equal eye, as God of all, a hero perish or a sparrow fall?'' A New York Hero, indeed! May Heaven welcome him home! And may his beloved Leola and his Family feel our prayerful support! (Msgr) William B. O'Brien President Daytop Village, Inc
