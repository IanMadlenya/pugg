        STERN--Stanley R. On January 24, 2004, our beloved friend and companion for 50 years passed away. Simply stated, Stanley Stern was a man whose loyalty, generosity, kindness and intellect transcended normal human bounds. He found intellectual pursuit the most nourishing of forces, and he saw it as a glorious school for the heart...his wisdom and intellect were free of disillusionment. We profoundly mourn the untimely death of our dear friend. His loving exuberance remains strong in our hearts and minds. We are confident but pray that he encounter a kind and gentle providence, and extend our most sincere love and sympathy to his beloved dear wife Lorrie, all of the children and grandchildren, all of whom he held so dear. Lee & Ralph Kern & family
