        SELZNICK-L. Jeffrey. The President, Board of Trustees, staff and extended family of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute mourn the passing, on May 12, of our esteemed friend & benefactor L. Jeffrey Selznick. Mr. Selznick will be remembered for his loyal commitment to Dana-Farber's mission of providing expert, compassionate cancer care and pursuing innovative, life-saving research. In the tradition of his grandfather, Louis B. Mayer, and his mother, Irene Mayer Selznick, Mr. Selznick has played a major role in the growth of Dana-Farber through the Louis B. Mayer Foundation, a five-decade supporter of the Institute. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Barbara, and to his family and friends. David G. Nathan, M.D., President Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
