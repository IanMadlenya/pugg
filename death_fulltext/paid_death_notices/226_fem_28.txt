        PEREIRA--Ana. The Heritage Health and Housing, Inc. Board of Directors and staff join the Pereira family in mourning the loss of our beloved Ana Pereira. She was 72. As Executive Director of Heritage Housing and Community Services--an organization she helped to found 28 years ago--Ms. Pereira was a champion to New York's neediest. Her vision, drive and determination transformed a storefront operation into a widely respected service and development agency, which delivered service-enriched housing services to the homeless and those with special needs. Under her vision and leadership, Heritage helped the city become a warmer place for those who have been historically disenfranchised. Today, as we mourn her, we are also entrenched and steeped in our commitment to continue the vision and extend ourselves caring for those who remain in need, assuring quality of care, forever building on a legacy of love and devotion. Charitable contributions in honor of Ms. Pereira's legacy can be made to the Ana Pereira Memorial Endowment Fund, 416 W. 127 St, New York, N.Y. 10027. Funeral will be held Saturday, November 5, 10AM at St. James Presbyterian Church, 141 St. and St. Nicholas Ave. The Repast will be held at Heritage Health and Housing, Inc., 416 W. 127 St, New York, N.Y. 10027.
