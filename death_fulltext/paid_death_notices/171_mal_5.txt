        CHUSID-Joseph G., M.D. The Medical Board, Medical Staff, and Department of Neurology of Saint Vincents Catholic Medical Centers of New York-Manhattan are deeply saddened to hear of the death of Joseph G. Chusid, M.D., Founding Director and Director Emeritus of the Department of Neurology. He served the institution for 40 years during which he established a successful training program for neurologists. He was a well-respected teacher and a caring and sensitive physician who carried out the mission of St. Vincent's and that of the Sisters of Charity. He worked in experimental epilepsy in primates and was internationally known and respected. Upon his retirement, his loyal service to St. Vincent's, its patients, and the Sisters of Charity was honored through the establishment of a library in his name. His colleagues, students and other members of the St. Vincent's staff join us in extending our sincere condolences to his family. His son and daughter, Michael and Joanna, request that donations be made to the Chusid Library, Department of Neurology, St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center of New York, 153 West 11th Street, New York, NY 10011. Enrique A. Bonfils-Roberts, M.D., President of the Medical Board Michael Garofalo, Jr., M.D., Chairman, Dept. of Neurology
