        MARX--Gertie F., MD. The Administration, Community Advisory Boards, Auxiliaries, and Medical Staff of Jacobi Medical Center mourn the death of Dr. Gertie F. Marx, Professor Emerita of Anesthesiology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, and longtime Anesthesia attending at Jacobi Center of the North Bronx Healthcare Network. An exceptional clinician, researcher, and teacher, Dr. Marx devoted her professional career to the provision of safe and effective methods of pain relief during labor and delivery. She is considered the ''mother of obstetric anesthesia,'' and the Gertie Marx Spinal Needle continues as the standard used today for administration of the epidural block used during labor. Her efforts to improve the care of mothers and their babies during childbirth have earned her worldwide recognition, respect, and admiration. Her passing is a sad loss to the medical community, and our hearts go out to her family and to all those who loved her. The Administration of the North Bronx Healthcare Network (NBHN); The Community Advisory Boards of the NBHN; The Auxiliaries of the NBHN; The NBHN Department of Anesthesia
