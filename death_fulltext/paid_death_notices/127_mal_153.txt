        HAAS-Albert B., MD. The entire community of New York University School of Medicine mourn the loss of our distinguished and loyal colleague Dr. Albert B. Haas. Over the years, his serivce to NYU as a foremost member of the faculty brought immeasurable knowledge, talent and grace to our academic programs. Dr. Haas graduated from medical school in Budapest. In 1940 after France fell to the Nazi's, Dr. Haas and his wife Sonja joined the French Resistance. The Haases were arrested and transported to separate concentration camps. Dr. Haas was imprisoned in Dachau and other camps where he was ordered to perform surgery even though he was not trained as a surgeon. Dr. Haas was able to acquire basic surgical skills by self study and assistance by other surgeons. These skills enabled him to save many prisoners. His extraodinary personal account-''The Doctor And The Damned''-was published later and received widespread acclaim. Dr. Haas immigrated to the United States and completed a residency in Bellevue Hospital. Thanks to the encouragement of Howard A. Rusk, Albert Haas joined the NYU Faculty. For over forty years Dr. Haas taught, conducted extensive research and co-authored with Dr. Rusk scientific papers on pulmonary diseases. The NYU faculty is greatly diminished by the passing of our dear friend, colleague and hero of WWII, Dr. Albert B. Haas. We are deeply saddened. All of us were fortunate to know him and benefit from his vast expertise and appreciate his kindly manner. We extend our deepest sympathy to Francois Haas, Ph.D., an Associate Professor of Rehabilitation Medicine at NYU Medical Center's Rusk Institute, and to Sheila, his wife, and their two daughters: Ariane and Alex.
