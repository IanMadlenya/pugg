        HECKELMAN-A. Joseph. Rabbi. 75. It is with deep sorrow that we mark the passing of our dear husband and father (may his memory be blessed). Yet we are comforted by the richness of his life and by the effect he had on the lives of others. He was the son of committed Jewish parents, Jack and Anna Heckelman, of Brooklyn, NY. Joe served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and earned a degree in electrical engineering from Columbia University. He put his radar expertise to use when he and his young bride, Tziporah, volunteered to serve in the Israeli Army during Israel's War of Independence in 1948-49. Upon returning to New York, he joined his father's business, the Olympic Glove Company, and took the helm following his father's death. At age 35, Joe decided to study for the rabbinate. He graduated from the Jewish Theological (Conservative) Seminary and was ordained in 1966, becoming Rabbi at Temple Beth El in Waterbury, CT. Ten years later, he and Tziporah made ''aliyah'' to Safed, Israel where they founded Kehillat Shalva, the first Conservative synagogue in Galilee. He was Kehillat Shalva's spiritual leader for 24 years until his death on February 1, 2001, Tet Shvat, 5761. His wife Tziporah, his brothers Sol and David, his son Yaqub (Joshua) and daughter Sara survive him. His children are both living in Jerusalem. Those wishing to make donations can contribute to a fund created in his memory to enable Kehillat Shalva to continue in its current location: Keren Yosef, C/O Kehillat Shalva, P.O. Box 1195, Safed, Israel. A memorial service will be held on March 4 at 11:00AM at B'nai Shalom Synagogue, 135 Roseland Avenue, Waterbury, Connecticut 06710.
