        KLEIN-Kurt. 1920-2002 The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and its governing Council deeply mourn the passing of Kurt Klein, a cherished friend of the Museum, and husband of Gerda Weissmann Klein, a member of the Museum's Council who, with her husband, has been a tireless advocate of Holocaust education, human rights, and tolerance. Together, they founded the Gerda and Kurt Klein Foundation, which promotes education, works to lessen prejudice and discrimination, and empowers students across the United States through education and community service. Born in Walldorf, Germany, Kurt fled the Nazi oppression in 1937 at age 17 and emigrated to the United States, leaving behind his parents, who ultimately perished in Auschwitz. As an American soldier he met Holocaust survivor Gerda Weissmann when he liberated her from a death march on May 7, 1945. Their marriage and inspirational story are known world-wide, recounted in Gerda's acclaimed autobiography All But My Life; the Academy-Award winning documentary One Survivor Remembers; their published letters, The Hours After, Letter of Love and Longing in War's Aftermath; the PBS documentary America and the Holocaust; and through their work and appearances across the world. To Gerda Klein, her children and grandchildren, we extend our deepest condolences. Fred Zeidman, Chairman Ruth Mandel, Vice Chair Sara Bloomfield, Director
