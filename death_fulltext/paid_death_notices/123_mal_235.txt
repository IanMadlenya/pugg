        WIRTH-Gunther. The Council, Officers, and Members of the University Club mourn the death on April 17, of Gunther Wirth, our esteemed and devoted Manager. Mr. Wirth served the Club and its Members superbly for the past twelve years. His leadership and dedication to the Club and its traditions were truly extraordinary. He was, above all, a gentleman, and we will miss him very much. We extend our profound sympathy to his wife and family. Paul J. Curran, President The University Club
