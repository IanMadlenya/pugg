        LEVITT -- Mortimer. New York City Opera mourns the loss of Mortimer Levitt, champion of the arts and dear friend. We will remember especially his candor and creativity, but most of all, his friendship. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife Mimi, daughter Elizabeth, and son Peter. Susan L. Baker, Chairman Paul Kellogg, General and Artistic Director Jane M. Gullong, Executive Director
