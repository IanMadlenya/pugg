        GOLD--Elliott. SonnenblickGoldman mourns the passing of Elliott Gold, a member of the SG team for almost 25 years. Elliott was always willing to assist his colleagues and clients, worked hard to close complex real estate financings, demonstrated unquestioning loyalty to SG and to clients, was a skilled finance professional, a nice person with a great smile, and a consummate team player. He will be missed. We extend our deepest sympathies and condolences to his family. Sonnenblick-Goldman, LLC
