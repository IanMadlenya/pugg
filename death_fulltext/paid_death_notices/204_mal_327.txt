        MERRIAM--George R. Jr., M.D. The faculty and staff at the Edward Harkness Eye Institute mourn the loss of Dr. George R. Merriam Jr., professor emeritus, a beloved physician and colleague. A leader in ophthalmology and in the department, he made enormous contributions to the radiation treatment of eye tumors, and established safe limits of radiation to and around the eye. To his patients, he was the most concerned, skillful caregiver. We will miss ''Bud,'' an outstanding doctor, scientist and great friend. Deepest sympathy to Martha, George III, John, Charlotte, Susan and many grandchildren. Stanley Chang, M.D. Dept of Ophthalmology Columbia University Medical Center
