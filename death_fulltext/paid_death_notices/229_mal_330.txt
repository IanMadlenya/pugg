        $(6$)MISHRICK--Abdallah S., M.D. The North Shore-Long Island Jewish (LIJ) Health System is deeply saddened by the passing of our dear friend and colleague, Abdallah S. Mishrick, M.D. Dr. Mishrick had a long and distinguished relationship with The North Shore-LIJHealth System, starting in the late 1950's when he did part of his surgical training at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset. He practiced at North Shore for about forty years before he was appointed senior vice president for medical affairs at North Shore-LIJ's Syosset Hospital in 1997, a title he also held at Plainview Hospital. Last year, he was appointed to the North Shore-LIJ Health System Board of Trustees. We extend our sincere condolences to his entire family, especially his wife, Jacqueline; son, Shukre; daughters, Orianna Cyprus and Shareen Mishrick; and step daughters, Andrea Harder, and Stacey Brennan. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to The NS-LIJ Foundation in memory of Dr. Mishrick, c/o D. Tascone, 221 Jericho Turnpike, Syosset, NY 11791. Michael Dowling, President Daniel de Roulet, Chairman North Shore-LIJ Health System
