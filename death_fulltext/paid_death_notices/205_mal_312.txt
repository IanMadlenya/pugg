        ACKERMAN -- Murray N. Adoring and beloved husband of Jean Gurin, married for 55 years. Devoted father of Robert (Randi) Ackerman and Susan (Irwin) Leibowitz, and cherished grandfather of Sean, Brittany, Jessica and Lauren, has silenced his song; but his melody lingers on. He fought valiantly and courageously with humor and strength. He lost his battle on Sunday, February 22. Service Wednesday, February 25, at 10 AM, Plaza Chapel, 91st Street and Amsterdam Ave.
