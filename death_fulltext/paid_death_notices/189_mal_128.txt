        ROTH-Sidney. Beloved husband of Maria Roth died on August 20th, 2002. Loving husband, brother, brother-in-law and uncle. A simple, generous man with a firm handshake and an easy smile, he was most at home on the open road. He served his country with honor and distinction, first in the U.S. Army during W.W. II and then in the Cold War as a member of the Counter-Intelligence Corps. He is survived by: his wife, Maria, brother, Melvin, brother-in-law Rabbi Julius Neumann (Esther), sisters-in-law Lily Gruen (Rabbi Isadore), Dr. Elizabeth Neumann, nieces, Frances, Nina, Veronica and nephews, Stanley, Tully, and Jeffrey. His wit and laugh will be missed.
