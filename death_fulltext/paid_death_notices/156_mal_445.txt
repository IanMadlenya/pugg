        SILBERMAN-Samuel J. A man of unparalleled wisdom and humility, a caring colleague and a trusted friend, Bud's passion for the entire Jewish people has been the cornerstone for Avi Chai's activities from when he participated in its founding in 1984. He left an indelible mark on all of us who had the privilege of learning from him. We join Lois and the family in mourning his passing this past Saturday, January 29.
