        WALSH-Wanda. The Trustees, Faculty and Staff of NYU School of Medicine note with great sorrow the passing of Wanda Walsh, MD, a beloved pediatrician and teacher for generations of students and residents who trained at Bellevue Hospital. With deep connections to our institution, Dr. Walsh earned her medical degree at NYU in 1950, joined the faculty in 1953 and became Associate Professor of Clinical Pediatrics in 1971-a position she held with grace and dignity until her retirement last year. Early on, at Bellevue Hospital, she worked closely with Dr. Saul Krugman on measels vaccine development, and remained an attending pediatrician there for 50 years. Her work in the clinics at Bellevue with children and their families was exemplary. Our deepest condolences to her husband, mother and children, with warmest appreciation for a remarkable woman who will be sorely missed. Kenneth Langone, Chairman NYU School of Medicine Foundation Board of Trustees Robert M. Glickman, MD, Dean NYU School of Medicine Wade P. Parks, MD, PhD Professor/Chairman of Pediatrics NYU School of Medicine
