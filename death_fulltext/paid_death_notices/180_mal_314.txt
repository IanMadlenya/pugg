        GOLDSMITH - David H. The Grand Street Boys' Association and The Grand Street Boys' Foundation express their deep sorrow at the passing of David H. Goldsmith, Chairman of the Board and past President of the The GBSA and distinguished Board Member of the GSBF. His total involvement in the charitable affairs of our organization and foundation were only exceeded by his devotion to his family, his wife Karen, their sons Jeffrey and David, their spouses and grandchildren. Notwithstanding his responsibilities as an active practicing attorney and partner in a law firm, he unselfishly gave of himself for the benefit of his fellow man. With Karen's constant support at his side, until her death last year, he provided inspirational leadership to GSBA over many decades, enabling it to carry on its' well known hobbies program as well as many other charitable endeavors. Under his guidance and wise counsel, the Foundation has provided financial support to 501(C)3 organizations far and wide. His Herculean efforts on behalf of Grand Street were equally matched by his Masonic works. We will miss his enthusiasm, his courage, his gentlemanlyness, his kindness and total concern for the welfare of others. Our heartfelt sympathy to his loving family.
