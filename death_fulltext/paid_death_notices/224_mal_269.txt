        EISENBUD--Leon. It is with a profound sense of loss that we, his former students and residents, note the passing of our beloved teacher and mentor, Dr. Leon Eisenbud. Dr. Eisenbud was our Professor Dumbledore, our Gandalf, who magically molded young dentists into thoughtful, educated, responsible, and caring doctors. Dr. Eisenbud taught socratically and by personal example. He had the ability to inspire his residents to excel through hard work and meticulous preparation. Like no other, Leon Eisenbud shaped our professional and personal lives. He was our benchmark, our gold standard. We were fortunate and privileged to have served under this kind and loving teacher and friend. The former Oral and Maxillofacial Surgical, Pediatric Dental, Oral Pathology, Dental Anesthesiology, and General Dental Residents of the Department of Dental Medicine, The Long Island Jewish Medical Center
