        KAYE - Arthur. 9/23/60 - 4/29/98. Passed away after a fierce, long and courageous battle with AIDS. Beloved son of Connie and Bob Kaye. Brother of Mary Wikowicz and John Kaye and uncle of many nieces and nephews who were so dear to him. Cherished friend of Jim Spera, Sandy Edelstein, Dean Taylor, Bob Andrews and many, many others. Arthur was respected and admired during a rich and rewarding career as an advertising industry executive. Strong and brave, loving and kind. He lived life more in 37 years than 10 men live in twice that time. Music lover, world traveler, chef and violinist are just a few of his varied interests and passions. Arthur lived this life with unfailing grace, unwavering dignity and unmatched style. He was a truly beautiful man, both inside and out. The lives of all who he touched-and there were many-have been immeasurably enriched by knowing him, and the light that he brought to all of our lives is sadly dimmed at his passing. He will be terribly, terribly missed. Though Arthur would have loved nothing more than to receive dozens of flowers, donations should be made to the AIDS charity of your choice. Mass to be held in West Palm Beach, Florida the week of May 4. Memorial service to take place in Los Angeles in June-exact date to be announced.
