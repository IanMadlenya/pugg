        COOPER -- Norman. The members of the Department of Pathology of the NYU School of Medicine mourn the loss of Norman Cooper, M.D. After graduating from Columbia University and the University of Rochester Medical School, Norman came to the Department in 1944 as a resident and stayed on as a faculty member. He served as Chief of Pathology at the Manhattan VA for 30 years and made significant contributions to the study of arthritis and understanding of the clinical manifestations and pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases. His compassionate, generous, and wise leadership was deeply appreciated by students, residents, and colleagues; his thoughtful counsel will be missed by the pathology community at NYU and beyond. We extend our deepest sympathies to his family. Vittorio Defendi, M.D., Ritter Professor of Oncology and former Chair of Pathology David B. Roth, M.D., Ph.D., Irene Diamond Professor of Immunology and Chair of Pathology, NYU School of Medicine
