        GOLDMAN--Enid. Our hearts cry out in profound sorrow at the loss of our beloved cousin. The world is diminished, its light darkened, by the passing of Enid who faced unspeakable odds with enormous courage and enduring optimism. Determined to leave a legacy of hope for all those afflicted with pancreatic cancer, she founded the Pancreatic Cancer Research Fund for Dr. Robert Fine at New York Presbyterian, Columbia. Compassion and love were the hallmarks of Enid's life. After a successful career as a talented interior designer, she pursued her dream to help others and became a psychologist specializing in the treatment of substance abuse victims. Throughout her life, Enid was deeply devoted to her family who were everything to her. To us, she was more than a cherished cousin; she was closer than a loving sister, a wise mentor, and a caring confidant with whom we shared our joys and our sorrows. This brilliant woman with her tremendous love, sublime beauty and gentle goodness has been taken from us. As we mourn her loss, we extend our heartfelt condolendes to her children Richard and Sharon Goldman, Jonathan and Elizabeth Goldman, Danny and Beth Shak, and their families. We will forever remember our beloved and precious Enid. Shelby and Bill Modell and the entire Modell Family
