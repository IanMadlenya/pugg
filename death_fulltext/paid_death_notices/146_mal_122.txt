        LEPERCQ-Paul. The partners, associates and staff of Lepercq, de Neuflize & Co. are profoundly saddened by the loss of Paul Lepercq, who died in Paris on February 27 of lymphocytic lymphoma. Mr. Lepercq was born in France, raised in Prague until age seven, and later educated in France. He emigrated to America in 1948 to attend the Harvard Business School and in 1949 joined Andre Istel & Co., which became Istel, Lepercq & Co. and later, Lepercq, de Neuflize & Co. He has been a resident of Bermuda since 1985. Mr. Lepercq served on the Boards of Director of Schlumberger Limited, American Saint Gobain, Groupe Danone, Gaumont S.A., Chargeurs, and Pathe. He also served as Chairman of the Board of the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) from 1971 to 1976. The Lepercq Space in BAM's main building was named in his honor in 1973, in acknowledgment of his early role in helping BAM develop into one of the world's foremost centers for contemporary performing arts. A funeral service will be held in Paris on Monday, March 8 at 11:00 A.M. at the Church of Saint Sulpice. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Francoise Stoll-Lepercq, and daughter, Edmee. He will be sorely missed by all of us. Francois Letaconnoux, President Lepercq, de Neuflize & Co. Inc
