        STOLIAR-Joan. On June 18, 2000, a woman of rare talents and unique dignity, understanding and warmth. She gave unsparingly of herself until her long-term bout with cancer took her suddenly and peacefully with her loved ones by her side. An award winning book designer and avid fly fisher, she devoted her later years to helping impaired and elderly attain good fishing and getting school children from New York City and upstate New York to understand more about the environment and clean water by raising trout in their classrooms. She is survived by her adoring husband of 47 years, Arthur, her devoted children, Lee Stoliar Dufresne of Charlotteville, NY, and Evan Stoliar of New York City, beloved grandchild Abby Dufresne, and treasured sister, Dr. Virginia Stein of Somerville, NJ. Funeral service Tuesday, June 20, at 1:15 PM, at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 W. 76 St, NYC (212) 362-6600. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations to a charity of your choice in Joan's name.
