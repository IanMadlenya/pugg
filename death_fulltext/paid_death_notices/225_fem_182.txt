        KRANZ--Mania. We mourn the loss of a true Aishet Chayil who taught the highest values and ethics of Judaism to her family. She was the mother of our esteemed Women's Board member, Fran Kupietzky, who is a Golden Founder and chair of our Development Committee. Sincerest condolences to Fran and Jonah Kupietzky, Rachel Lipsitz and the entire family. May they be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
