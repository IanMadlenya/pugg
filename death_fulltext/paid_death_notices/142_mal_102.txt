        de PAUR-Leonard. It is with great sadness that The Board, staff and friends of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Inc. mourn the passing of Leonard de Paur, former Director of Community Relations for Lincoln Center, a position he held for 17 years. His creative vision and commitment to making the arts available to everyone lives on in the programs he created. Twenty-eight years ago Mr. de Paur founded Lincoln Center Outof-Doors which today thrives as one of the largest free public performing arts events in the country. Each summer Lincoln Center Outof-Doors makes accessible the highest caliber of dance, music, and performance artistry from around the globe to over 200,000 people. Mr. de Paur leaves an unparalleled legacy of passion for and devotion to the arts. His enlightening wisdom and guidance will be sorely missed. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his wife Norma, his son Leonard C., his daughter Norma Lynn and his three grandchildren. Beverly Sills, Chairman Nathan Leventhal, President Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Inc.
