We had the pleasure of knowing him through his wife, Mrs. Barbara Fleischman, who has long been part of the Thirteen/WNET family, as a member of our Board (1975 to 1984) and former chairperson of the Friends of Channel Thirteen. Barbara, you have shared your gifts of leadership and friendship with us for many years, and we are with you and your children, in our hearts, during this difficult time of mourning for your husband.
