        GARTENBERG-Irving L., 78. On October 5, 2001. Dear husband of Lois. Proud father of Julie and the late Jim (Jill). Adoring ''Pa'' of Nicole. World War II vet; NYU and Harvard Law School graduate. Loving and lovable; caring and cared about; interesting and interested; sensible and sensitive. A man of honor with exemplary values. Dedicated the majority of his life to the practice of corporate law while remembering, thanks especially to his children and grandchild, the importance of ''fun''. His brilliant mind and sharp sense of humor, complemented by his gentle nature, will be missed by family and friends, near and far. Services were private.
        GARTENBERG-Irving L. Dearest and beloved friend, mentor and revered employer in excess of 43 years. Your passing leaves an enormous void and ache in my heart. I will treasure the memories of our lifetime together. You will be forever missed. Shelly deeply mourns with me. Zichrono Li' Vracha Fanny Handel
