        PETERKA-Harryetta. The American Academy of Dramatic Arts announces with sorrow the tragic passing of Harryetta Peterka, Director of Instruction, on Tuesday, June 2. Herself a graduate of the Academy, she was a recipient of the Jehlinger Award in 1958, the highest honor bestowed upon an Academy student. She toured as a member of the school's post-graduate performance ensemble, the Academy Repertory Company, in the 1958-59 season, playing Abigail in ''The Crucible,'' and Elizabeth I in ''Young Elizabeth.'' She began teaching at the Academy in 1964 while still acting professionally, eventually becoming Director of the Evening School, and Associate Director of the Professional Training Program, prior to being named Director of Instruction in 1992. She is survived by her beloved husband, William Damon. To her students and colleagues, Harryetta was a unique and powerful force, a friend, mentor and guiding light. Her dedication to the theatre and to all the students who pursued a life in the theatre was without limit. Her love of the craft of acting forced her to continue to educate herself and those around her, and her love and concern for her students carried on beyond their enrollment at the Academy. She will be missed, but never forgotten, and she will live on in the hearts of those whose lives she touched. A memorial service will be held in the near future.
