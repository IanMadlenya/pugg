        PASTERNACK - Winifred. With tremendous sorrow I note the untimely death of my valued and dedicated partner in the law firm of Halpern & Pasternack, a superb lawyer and staunch civil libertarian, and a close friend for over 30 years. Winnie loved poetry and had a passion for good literature. She was a beloved friend of my entire family, my wife Carol and our children Matt, Jane and Tom, and all of us will miss her terribly. We send our profound sympathy to her devoted daughters, Karen and Ellen, and her entire family. Jerry Halpern
