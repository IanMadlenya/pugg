        BAMBERGER--Maria. It is with great sadness that Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion records the death of Maria Bamberger, the dear wife of the late Fritz Bamberger, my teacher, beloved member of the HUC-JIR faculty and treasured advisor to my predecessors, Nelson Glueck and Alfred Gottschalk. Maria was a dramatic presence in Israel and instrumental in the founding of our Jerusalem campus. Her life, and that of Fritz, reflected an abiding devotion to HUC-JIR. May the family find comfort together with all those who mourn for Zion and Jerusalem and may Maria's memory be a blessing to all who knew her.
