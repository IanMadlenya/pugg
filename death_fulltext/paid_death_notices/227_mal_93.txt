        RUTTENSTEIN -- Kalman, ''Kal.'' Senior Vice President, Fashion Direction. June 9, 1936--December 8, 2005. Kal has been part of our family for 28 years. He lived life on the edge of fashion and entertainment. He discovered. He taught. He mentored. He knew what was hot before it was. He loved dining and dishing at the restaurant of the moment. He had a unique sense of humor and was a master of style. He was larger than life, and life at Bloomingdale's without him will be different. We are all so sad. Michael Gould Chairman & CEO Bloomingdale's
