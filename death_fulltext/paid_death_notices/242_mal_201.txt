        ZEBROWSKI--Kenneth P. With great sorrow, the New York State Assembly mourns the passing of our friend and colleague, Assembly Member Ken Zebrowski. Speaker Sheldon Silver and the members of the New York State Assembly offer our sympathy and our prayers to the Zebrowski family, to Assembly Member Ken Zebrowski's many friends, and to the citizens of New City, Haverstraw, and all of Rockland County. From the moment he was elected to the county legislature in 1973, Ken Zebrowski served the communities of his beloved Rockland County with dedication and joy. Elected to the Assembly in 2004, Ken Zebrowski was known for the profound respect he held for the law, and for his unshakable faith in the legislative branch of government. Throughout his service, Ken was guided by three simple and oft-stated maxims: The Legislature is the people's best window for immediate access to their government. Legislation offers the most direct and effective response to my constituents' concerns and problems. The needs of every Rockland County resident are my concern. In the State Capitol, Ken Zebrowski was admired for his leadership and integrity, his wisdom and wit, his compassion and most of all, his generous spirit. Ken was a valued member of several Assembly committees. He was committed to improving public education, reforming the state's healthcare system, protecting the elderly, and assisting those communities hurt by the Mirant Utility Company bankruptcy and assessment challenge. It was an honor to serve with him and a privilege to know him both as a friend and as a colleague. We will miss him dearly. Sheldon Silver Speaker of the NYS Assembly
