        STEERE-Dorothy Osborne. The Board, Staff and Friends of the New York Botanical Garden are deeply saddened by the loss of our beloved friend Dorothy Osborne Steere. Dorothy was the widow of William Campbell Steere, Sr, distinguished international botanist, mentor to generations of researchers, and Garden President from 1958 to 1972. Known with great affection as the ''First Lady of the Garden'', Dorothy touched the lives of Garden staff from the 1950s to as recently as last week. We will cherish the memories of her delightful sense of humor, spirited curiosity, unfailing acumen, and enduring warmth. We extend our heartfelt condolences to her son William C. Steere, Jr., Vice-Chairman of the Garden, and his wife Lynda, her daughter Alice Steere Coulombe and her husband Joseph and her grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Wilson Nolen, Chairman Thomas J. Hubbard, Chairman Emeritus Gregory Long, President Brian M. Boom, Ph.D, Vice-President for Botanical Science and Pfizer Curator of Botany Patricia K. Holmgren, Ph.D, Director Emeritus, NYBG Herbarium
