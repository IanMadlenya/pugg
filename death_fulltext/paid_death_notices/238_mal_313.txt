        BESSO--Victor. The Baruch College community mourns the passing of Victor Besso '47, Trustee Emeritus of The Baruch College Fund and a devoted friend and supporter of his alma mater over several decades. An urbane and witty man who spoke several languages, Besso had a long career as a highly successful international trader and rejoiced in the cultural richness and many languages of Baruch College. Fittingly, his last gift to Baruch was in support of international programs and internships. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Nidia and to all his family and friends. His friendship and generosity to Baruch College will be sorely missed. Kathleen Waldron President Baruch College Larry Zicklin '57 President The Baruch College Fund
