        SCHWARTZ - Elizabeth. Naflah Ateres Roshainu. The Young Israel of Oceanside is grief-stricken in announcing the death of our beloved Rebbetzin, Liz Schwartz, Z.T.L. Her impact upon our community cannot be measured by the too few years that she graced us, but rather by the indelible impact that she has left upon us. Our entire community sits with our Rabbi and their daughter Ayala in mourning for her. In this period of national mourning for the Jewish people, may the family be comforted among those who mourn for Zion and Jerusalem. Evan Torczyner, President Herb Wallenstein, Chairman of the Board
        SCHWARTZ-Elizabeth. Temple Avodah expresses deepest sympathy to Rabbi Jay Yaacov Schwartz and family on the death of his wife Elizabeth. She was a respected member of this community and will be missed by all. Board of Trustees
