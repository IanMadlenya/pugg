        COHEN-Donald J. The Joseph Slifka Center for Jewish Life at Yale mourns the passing of our great friend and former President, Donald J. Cohen. Donald exemplified what it means to live a Jewish life. He was a warm and caring friend to generations of our students, a wise and inspiring leader of our Board and the brilliant general of the campaign to create our Center. In every word and gesture we could see an expression of his lifetime of engagement with Jewish learning and values. May our Center always embody his spirit of openness and inclusion and his love of Jewish life. We offer our prayers to Donald's family. May the remain part of the Slifka Center for generations to come.
