        KEENE - Constance. The Manhattan School of Music mourns the loss of Constance Keene, esteemed member of the faculty since 1969, who also served as former chair of the School's piano department, and since 1997 was a member of its Board of Trustees. As one of the world's leading concert pianists and distinguished piano teachers, with her impeccable musicianship, artistry, intellect and grace, Constance shaped generations of pianists who have had an enormous positive impact on the profession. Her performances, both onstage and through her recordings, enriched the lives of so many and her invaluable warmth and giving endeared her to her many students and colleagues. Manhattan School of Music honored her in 2004 with a degree of doctor of musical arts, honoris causa. She will be deeply missed by the entire Manhattan School community. Our most heartfelt condolences to her beloved Milton. David A. Rahm, Chairman Board of Trustees Robert Sirota, President
