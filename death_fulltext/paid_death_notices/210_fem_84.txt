        BERINI--Bianca. The Metropolitan Opera deeply mourns the death of our colleague Bianca Berini. A committed artist steeped in the great musical traditions of Italy, she was a vivid exponent of the great Verdi mezzo-soprano roles as well as leading parts in the Verismo repertoire. Following her Met debut on tour in Atlanta in May 1976, she gave almost 100 performances with the company and was heard in our house as Amneris, Azucena, Eboli and, most notably, Ulrica in ''Un Ballo in Maschera'' which she sang over 30 times. Her last appearance was at our centennial gala in 1983. We extend our deepest condolences to her family and friends. Joseph Volpe, General Manager James Levine, Artistic Director
