        LIBERMAN-James B. The Directors and Officers of GPU, Inc. mourn the passing of James B. Liberman, who for more than 50 years provided his wise counsel, persuasive advocacy and unlimited strength of purpose in good times and in bad. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Nadine, his daughter, Lee, and his brother, Lee, and to all of his extended family.
