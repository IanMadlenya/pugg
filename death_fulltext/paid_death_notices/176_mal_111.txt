        COHEN-Sylvan M., Esquire. ICSC, its Trustees, Staff and Members mourn the passing of our beloved Trustee, friend and shopping center pioneer. A founding member, ICSC Chairman 1976-1977, member of the Law Conference Committee, Chairman of the Government Affairs Committee and Chairman of the Political Action Committee, Sylvan was one of the earliest recipients of the ICSC Trustees Distinguished Service Award. If a life can be described in two words, then ''distinguished'' and ''service'' are the ones for Sylvan Cohen. We send our heartfelt sympathy to his wonderful family on their loss. Michael Kercheval, President John Riordan, Vice Chairman International Council of Shopping Centers
