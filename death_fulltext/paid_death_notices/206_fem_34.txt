        ENGELHARD -- Jane. The Trustees, Fellows, and staff of The Pierpont Morgan Libary mourn the death of Jane Engelhard. She served as a valuable member of the Board of Trustees from 1974 to 1986 and was a Trustee Emerita from 1986 to 2004. Jane, exceptionally intelligent and deeply committed to the highest standards in all things, was a singularly inspiring presence at the Morgan Libary, to which she made contributions of lasting importance. And her kindness, like her elegance and generosity, will not be forgotten. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to her family, especially to her daughter Annette de la Renta, a Trustee of the Libary, as well as her daughters Sophie Craighead, Susan O'Connor, Sally Engelhard Pingree, and Charlene Engelhard Troy, Fellows of the Library. Charles E. Pierce, Jr., Dir S. Parker Gilbert, Pres, Board of Trustees
        ENGELHARD--Jane. A beautiful, remarkable woman and a friend for more than 40 years. My deepest sympathy to her family. Aaron Shikler
