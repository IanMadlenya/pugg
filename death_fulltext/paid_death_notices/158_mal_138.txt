        NEIMAN-Harold. In Las Vegas, NV, on March 9. Beloved husband of Ruth; loving father of Laurie, Melissa, Jennifer, Alphonse, Neal and Steve. Adoring grandfather of Elyse, Hayley and Jeffrey; and very dear brother in-law, uncle and friend. He was a WW II veteran, an NYU Business School graduate and former President of Flexi-Van Corp. His warmth and sense of humor will be missed.
