        FISHER-Harry, 92, soldier, pacifist, writer, activist, died March 22, after participating in a demonstration against the war on Iraq. He grew up in the Hebrew National Orphan Home, became a labor organizer, fought fascism in Spain with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, and served as a B-26 turret gunner in World War II. Married to Ruth Goldstein in 1939, they shared an office, a daily walk to work, and a passion for life until her death in 1993. In 1998 Harry's Spanish Civil War memoir, ''Comrades,'' was published in the U.S. and subsequently in Germany and Spain, leading to speaking tours around the world. Just before his death, Harry finished his second book, ''Legacy.'' He is survived by his son and daughter, John and Wendy; their spouses, Dena and Geoffrey; grandchildren, Paul, Emilia, and Rachel, as well as the Becker, Grad, Henley, Weisman, and Goldstein families. Harry Fisher is also survived by an ever-growing number of antiwar comrades, and will be sorely missed by his family and the great many people he touched in his short 92 years.
