        LUBELL-Mary. The Yeshiva University family is deeply saddened by the passing of a highly respected member of the Jewish community, beloved wife of our devoted friend & coworker, Arthur Lubell. Mrs. Lubell received the Valiant Woman award at last year's Spring Luncheon of the YU Women's Organization. Mr. Lubell is a leading member of the University's Planned Giving Committee. A trustee of the Sidney Weisner Estate, he helped established a research program at our Albert Einstein Colleg of Medicine, a chair in political science at YU, scholarships at Yeshiva College and Stern College for Women, and Rabbinic Kollel Fellwoships at our affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary-all in memory of Sidney Weisner. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Arthur Lubell; children, Ruth, Diane, and Lewis; grandchildren, and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University David S. Gottesman, Chairman Board of Trustees Judah Feinerman, Chairman RIETS Board of Trustees Dinah Pinczower Chairman, National Board, YUWO
