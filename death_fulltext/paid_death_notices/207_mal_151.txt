        USLAN--Seymour. June 12, 1921-April 11, 2004. Cherished father, devoted grandfather and great-grandfather, and friend to many. He is survived by his daughter Sheila Jacobs and her husband Harvey; grandchildren Ari Jacobs and his wife Melissa, and Matthew Jacobs and his wife Robin; and great-grandchildren Alex and Ethan Jacobs. He was predeceased by his devoted wife Minna. Known to all as Sy, he rallied friends and family to find love and humor in everyday living. Sy earned a degree in engineering and served his country with honor and distinction during WWII, obtaining top secret clearance to work on projects that brought an early end to the War. Sy founded AMPHOTO, a photographic book publishing company. In his retirement, he was a resident of Classic Residents by Hyatt, where his dynamic personality created an atmosphere of warmth and liveliness. Sy will be sorely missed.
