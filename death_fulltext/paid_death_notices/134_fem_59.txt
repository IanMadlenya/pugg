        WASSERMAN - Miriam. The Board of Directors, council, staff and friends of the Hudson Guild note, with deep sorrow, the passing of our generous and devoted friend. A member of the Board of Trustees from 1962 to 1998, Mrs. Wasserman showed her devotion to the Guild in countless ways. Her commitment to the mission of the Hudson Guild will continue to inspire us long after her passing. She will be greatly missed.
