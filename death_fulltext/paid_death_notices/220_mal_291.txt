        BEDER--Michael. Died on May 27, 2005, after a long and courageous battle with Alzheimer's Disease. He was the dedicated son of Adele and Sam, beloved brother of Alan, cherished friend of exwife Marta and her husband Harvey, and loved and loving father of Nicole and Joel and grandfather of baby Emma Orchid. Above all a true friend, Michael was a man of fierce love, lavish feeling and unending compassion; he gave to us and anyone in need unselfishly, unquestioningly and completely. His generosity and strength of character will be missed. In lieu of flowers, donations in his memory may be made to the Alzheimer's Association or to moveon.org. Service Thursday, June 2, 5:00 p.m. at ''The Riverside'', 76 Street and Amsterdam Avenue.
