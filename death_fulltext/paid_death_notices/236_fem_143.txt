        LAZAR--Judy. It is with profound sadness that we mourn our friend, colleague and SAJES Board member, Judy Lazar. Judy was a dedicated supporter of Jewish education and a beloved member of this community. Judy touched many lives in many ways--chairing events and taking on countless leadership roles. Most important was her role as trusted friend, advisor and wise counsel. Judy's loss is immeasurable-for us at SAJES, the Suffolk YJCC and our UJA-Federation family. Our sincere condolences to Joel and to her beloved family. May Judy Lazar's memory always be for a blessing. David I. Rosenberg, President Deborah Friedman,Exec. Dir. SAJES
