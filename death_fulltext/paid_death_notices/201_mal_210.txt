        FRIEDENTHAL -- Meyer ''Mike''. During a battle in France, American GI's lay wounded on a mine field. Dr. Meyer ''Mike'' Friedenthal, a young medical officer, volunteered to lead a rescue. One soldier in his squad lost a foot to a mine. But all returned alive, bringing home the wounded. Mike received the Silver Star for his valor. A gifted diagnostician, Mike was a hero to his patients too. Many of them, too poor to pay their bills, received loans instead. Mike never bragged. Even his movie star looks seemed unexceptional to him. At 90, having suffered a stroke, and confined to a wheel chair, Mike died of heart failure. Mike is survived by his two sons, step-daughter, step-son, three grandchildren and wife, who loved him and always will.
