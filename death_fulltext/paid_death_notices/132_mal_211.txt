Mr. Stone practiced law in New York for many years, at one time associated with Root, Clark, Buckner & Ballentine, with Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton, later with Stone, Malone, Driver & McNeill, and then for a number of years before his death under his own name. Mr. Stone had attended Harvard Law School, transferred to Columbia Law in 1930, and received his L.L.B. in 1932. He ran for the State Assembly in 1932 and thereafter worked for the State Legislative where he drafted the New York Public Housing Act. In addition to practicing law, Mr. Stone wrote poetry and his poems appeared in many leading poetry magazines. He is survived by Mr. and Mrs. James Martin Stone of Boston, by Eugene Robert Stone of New York, and two beloved grandchildren, Curtis Henry Stone and Lauren Kelly Stone. Mr. Stone was a member of the California Bar and probably the oldest volunteer fireman in the Pelham, NY, Volunteer Hose Company #
