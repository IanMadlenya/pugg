        LEPERCQ-Paul. BAM and I will deeply miss Paul Lepercq. Paul stood out in his aristocratic demeanor, his idiosyncratic ways, his sharp intelligence and his cultivated wisdom. He was a mentor to me for over 30 years at BAM, and I turned to him time and again for advice and counsel. BAM and I have lost a true friend. We send condolences to his wife and daughter and to his beloved protege Francois Letaconnoux. Harvey Lichtenstein, President Brooklyn Academy of Music
