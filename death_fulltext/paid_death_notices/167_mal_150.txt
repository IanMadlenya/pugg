        LEVY-Jack. December 9, 2000. Thank you for being the dearest, sweetest, most devoted, wonderful father. You will be with me every day. Be at peace with my mother Joyce, your wife of 60 years. Your loving daughter, Donna Cohen
        LEVY-Jack. Our thoughts and prayers are with Jason, Lisa, Donna and the Levy family on the loss of their grandfather and father. He was a good man and will be fondly remembered. Linda and Stephen R. Cohen
