As a student of Hans Hoffman at the Art Students League in the 1950's, he was in the vanguard of young painters who achieved fame as the New York School of Abstract Expressionism. He taught at U.C. Davis, and at Otis Art Institute in CA, later returning to Manhattan to teach at the School of Visual Arts. Born in Brooklyn, August 17, 1923, he was the son of Lillian Gordon and Max Forst. His first marriage to Barbara Forst ended in divorce.

His unrivaled zest for French and Chinese cuisine, world literature, especially James Joyce, art in its countless forms, and jazz, will continue to enliven his nieces, nephews, students, and friends. Visitation will be Sunday April 9, at the Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 W. 76th Street at Amsterdam Avenue, between the hours of 2-5 and 7-9 pm.
