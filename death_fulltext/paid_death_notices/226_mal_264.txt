        DUBERSTEIN--Judge Conrad B., St. John's University notes with sorrow the passing of a most distinguished alum, supporter, and special friend Judge Conrad B. Duberstein, United States Bankruptcy Judge for the Eastern District of New York. As a distinguished graduate of St. John's, Judge Duberstein was honored by the University with the University Medal of Honor (the highest award given to a graduate) in 2001 and an honorary Doctor of Laws degree in 1991. Judge Duberstein's love for the law was eclipsed only by the true and everlasting love for his wife Anne, his daughter Elysa and his grandchildren. Donald J. Harrington, C.M. President
