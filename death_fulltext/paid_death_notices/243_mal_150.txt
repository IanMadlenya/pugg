        YOUNG--Edgar. The Juilliard School extends its deepest condolences to the family of Edgar Young. An individual of great intelligence, he helped build the Lincoln Center concept and was instrumental in realizing many of the initiatives developed for the new arts center in the 1960s. His contribution to the creation of Lincoln Center and the move of The Juilliard School to its current home will always be deeply appreciated by the Juilliard Community. Bruce Kovner, Chairman Joseph W. Polisi, President
