        GREENFIELD-Alvin K. The Officers, Board of Trustees and Rabbis of Temple Avodah in Oceanside, N.Y. express their deepest sympathy to Sybil Greenfield and family on the passing of our dear friend, Alvin K. Greenfield. He was one of the founding fathers of this Temple and a beloved past President. He also inspired us for many years by blowing the Shofar on the High Holidays. His generosity and forethought enabled us to thrive throughout the years.
