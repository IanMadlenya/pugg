        STRAUSS-John (Hans), 85. Died September 6, 1998. The family of Hans Strauss mourns the loss of their beloved husband and father. Born and raised in Vienna, Austria, Hans earned his Doctorate of Law from the University of Vienna in 1938. That same year, to escape Nazi persecution, he and his wife, Irma, emigrated to the U.S., settled in NYC and created a new life. He founded Atlas Traffic Consultants in 1958 and was its President until his retirement in 1978. His volunteer activities included teaching in an adult literacy program, FEGS, translating central synagogue archives. He was an avid stamp and coin collector. He satisfied his passion for journalism by writing and publishing stories, poems and articles in German and English. His lifelong love of language and learning never diminished. He was outspoken in his commitment and concern for those less fortunate. He leaves his wife of sixty years, Irma, his two daughters and their families, Susan, Sandy and Daniel Jacobs, Connie, Mark, & Michael Kolber, his brother, George Strauss, several cousins, nieces, nephews, and many valued friends. A service in his memory will be held Thursday, September 10, at 3 PM at Gutterman Funeral Home, 8000 Jericho Turnpike, Woodbury, Long Island.
