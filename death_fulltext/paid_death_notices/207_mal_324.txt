        SOBERMAN--Robert J., M.D., The faculty and staff of the New York University School of Medicine express their deep sadness over the death of our friend and colleague, Robert J. Soberman, M.D., Professor of Medicine and Associate Dean for Post-Graduate Programs at the NYU Post - Graduate Medical School. Dr. Soberman was a respected faculty member whose career at NYU spanned more than 50 years. A graduate of NYU School of Medicine, he completed his internship and residency at Bellevue Hospital. After joining the faculty in 1951, he became a prominent figure in the field of nephrology, especially in kidney and pancreas transplantation, and helped develop national regulations for fair organ procurement and distribution. Through his enduring commitment to medical education, Dr. Soberman played an important role in strengthening programs for physicians to gain new skills throughout their careers. We will always remember Dr. Soberman for his skills as a physician, his concern for his patients, and his tireless dedication to NYU School of Medicine. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Beatrice, his children, Roy, Diane, and Nina, and the entire Soberman family on this sad occasion. Robert M.
