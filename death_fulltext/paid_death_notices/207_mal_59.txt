        BRONSTHER--Burton, M.D. It is with sadness that we acknowledge the untimely death of our friend and colleague, Dr. Burton Bronsther. Dr. Bronsther was one of the founding pediatric surgeons on Long Island. He served with distinction as a member of the staff of Pediatric Surgery at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center for over 40 years. He played a vital role in the establishment of the Schneider Children's Hospital and it was through his vision that the Children's Hospital was established. A renowned surgeon, Dr. Bronsther was a man with many interests, a devoted husband, a loving father and grandfather. He had an outstanding ability to interact with his patients, their families, peers, members of the nursing staff and everyone with whom he came in contact. He was a man of humor and integrity and was loved by his patients the world over and respected by his peers. The faculty and staff of the Schneider Children's Hospital mourn his passing and acknowledge the loss of one of its finest doctors. Condolences to his loving wife, Ellyn, his children and grandchildren. Philip Lanzkowsky, MD Executive Director and Chief of Staff Schneider Children's Hospital
