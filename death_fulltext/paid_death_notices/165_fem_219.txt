        HENDRICKSON-Rita G. Goodbye, Rita. A good family friend for over ninety years. We will always remember your stories about your early years on East 88th Street ....your big sister, enjoying a little beer and some Limburger cheese with black radish on black pumpernickel with your father. Sorry you couldn't wait for the end of the World Series. Pour yourself a Dewar's tonight, there's plenty of ice. Eisenkramer & Brown Families
        HENDRICKSON - Rita. Central Synagogue records with profound sorrow the passing of its member, Rita Hendrickson. We extend heartfelt sympathy to her bereaved family. Peter J. Rubinstein, Rabbi Samuel Wasserman, President
