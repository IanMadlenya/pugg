        VAN NOSTRAND--Judy. The Board of Directors of the Isabel O'Neil Foundation and the members of the Isabel O'Neil Studio Workshop are deeply saddened by the loss of our fellow Board member, teacher and beloved friend. She was a founding Board member, generous supporter and avid painter for over forty years. We shall miss her dearly and send our deepest sympathy to her family.
