        GRUBER-Jessie. 90 years young, of Brooklyn Heights, NY. On December 8, 1999. Loving sister to Golden, Eva and Mary. She also leaves behind nephew Morton and niece Susan, whom she treated as her own children, their families, five grandnieces and one greatgrandniece. The planet lost a unique individual whose quick mind and irreverent, yet loving, nature made a lasting impression on all. Adios. Her family and friends are asked to celebrate her life at her home on Saturday, December 18, from 1 to 4 PM.
