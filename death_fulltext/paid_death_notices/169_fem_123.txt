        CUNEO-Gloria. The Catholic Traditionalist Movement (CTM) mourns the passing into Heaven of its co-founder and, for the past thirty-seven years, General Secretary. While traditionalist Catholics the world over will gratefully remember her behind-the-scenes self-effacing dignity and grace that made the traditional Roman Catholic Mass in Latin available to them via weekly shortwave radio and daily internet, she will be even more deeply missed at the CTM headquarters' Ave Maria Chapel in Westbury, Long Island, where her loving and caring ways in so many different capacities made her the community's leading traditionalist lay person, especially endearing herself to the children of two generations. With lasting gratitude, I will personally offer the traditional Latin Roman Catholic Requiem Funeral Mass for at our Ave Maria Chapel, 210 Maple Avenue, Webtbury, Long Island, N.Y. at 10 A.M. this Thursday. Rev. Dr. Gommar A. De Pauw Founder-President Catholic Traditionalist Movement
