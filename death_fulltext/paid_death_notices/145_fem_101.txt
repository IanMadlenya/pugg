        SILVERMAN-Betty Sue (nee Goldin), on February 9. She was a wonderful, warm and loving person and a vital part of the community. She had a great laugh and made everyone feel special and important. To have known her is a privilege. Our love to her family who she treasured above all: Gene, Judy, Gail, Marsha, Matt, Glen, Hannah, Charlotte, Rachel and Rebecca. Betty will always live on in our hearts. Elaine, Jay, Laura, Douglas, Austin and Alex
