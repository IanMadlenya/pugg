        LIEBERMAN-Minnie. AMIT is deeply saddened by the passing of our cherished benefactor and beloved sister of our dedicated patron, Leon Miller. A woman who cared deeply for the disadvantaged children of Israel, Minnie Lieberman established the AMIT Mishpachton Residential Facility in Jerusalem. Her legacy of compassion, loving-kindness and philanthropy is a model for us all. Heartfelt condolences to the entire family. Evelyn Blachor, President Marvin Leff, Executive Director
