        WHITNEY-Lisa Lentnek. The officers and staff of UJA-Federation of NY mourn the untimely passing of Lisa Lentnek Whitney whose parents, Donald and Ruth Lentnek, have been our dedicated supporters for many years. Her commitment to those in need was as passionate as her devotion to her family, and she will be missed by so many. Our deepest sympathies go to her parents; her husband, Klaus; her children, Matthew and Steven; her sister, Marci; and the entire family. May all who benefited from Lisa's kindness and wisdom be consoled among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. James S. Tisch, President Larry Zicklin, Board Chair John S. Ruskay, Exec VP & CEO
