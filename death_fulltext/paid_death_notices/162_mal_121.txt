        HEJDUK-John. The Irwin S. Chanin School of Architecture of The Cooper Union mourns the loss of its leader, Dean John Hejduk. We express our condolences to Gloria, Rafael and Renata and all of the Hejduk family. As an architect, an administrator and as an educator, we are all the beneficiaries of Dean Hejduk's generosity of thought and depth of spirit. Thanks to his dedication and vision, the school is a unique place where creativity, leadership and innovation thrive. Dean Hejduk's independence and his commitment to independence were an inspiration for over half a century. It was and will continue to be a privilege for us to work and learn in his Foundation Building. John Hejduk was a gentleman and a gentle man. His example will continue to inspire us all. John, you will be deeply missed. The Irwin S. Chanin School of Architecture of The Cooper Union
