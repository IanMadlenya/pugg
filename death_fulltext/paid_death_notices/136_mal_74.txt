        PROTA-Anthony. On May 5, 1998. Respected Senior V.P. of Wolf Gordon, Inc. Tony was one of four founders of our firm, which became and remained one of the largest independent suppliers of commercial wall covering in the United States. Tony will be sorely missed by all of us at Wolf Gordon and by everyone dealing with our company as much for his warmth and upbeat personality, as for his expertise in our field. We personally have lost a special friend. Mel, Bernie, Rick, David, and Rob.
