        APPLEBY--Thomas L. The past and current members of the Board of Directors and staff of the United Nations Development Corporation mourn the passing of Thomas Appleby. Tom Appleby was the Corporation's first President taking office in 1969. His vision, spirit and extraordinary leadership during 23 years of service to the Corporation were instrumental in the successful planning of the United Nations Development District and construction in the District of the architecturally distinguished buildings at One, Two and Three UN Plaza to help meet the needs of the United Nations for office and related facilities. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Tom's wife, Doris, to their three children and to Tom's entire family. George Klein, Chairman Senator Roy M. Goodman, President and CEO Jeffrey Feldman, Executive Vice President
