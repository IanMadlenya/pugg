        SELLARS -- Louise Roy, whose life's work was dedicated to service and volunteerism, died peacefully July 6 in Mount Vernon, NY. In her work with the Red Cross, Girl Scouts, March of Dimes, UNICEF and the League of Women Voters, she inspired partnerships and collaborations among people. At the March of Dimes she pioneered health programs involving young people and civic and social leaders. During her 15 years as a full-time volunteer with UNICEF, she received many awards for her leadership and vision and, as president of the Bronxville League of Women Voters, she continued to empower others. She saw the natural synergies between individuals and groups, creating positive outcomes for the participants and beneficiaries. Among her survivors is her grandson, Peter Sellars, the theater and opera director. All who knew this great lady will deeply miss her. A memorial service will be held in her honor Sunday, August 7, at 2 PM, at the Women's Club, 136 Midland Ave., Bronxville. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to U.S. Fund for UNICEF, 333 E. 38th St., NYC 10016; March of Dimes, 1275 Mamaroneck Ave, White Plains, NY 10605; the League of Women Voters, PO Box 321, Bronxville, NY 10708.
