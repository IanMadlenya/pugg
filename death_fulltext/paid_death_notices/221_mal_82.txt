        TEBET--David W. The Officers, Governors and Members of the New York Friars Club deeply mourn the loss of their beloved member, David Tebet. A member of the Friars Club for almost five decades, David was fierce in his dedication, talent, and efforts in producing the Friars legendary Testamonial Dinners, which are an integral part of the Club's legacy. His showcasing of the giants of Hollywood elevated the Friars Club to become a major force in entertainment. We are deeply indebted to the personal guidance he provided while serving as a Board member and as the Chamberlain of the Friars. The Club could not have had a better friend, a more loyal brother and a more valued Friar than David Tebet. Private services will be held in Los Angeles.
