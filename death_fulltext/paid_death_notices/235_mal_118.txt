        HERTER--Richard Eric. Born August 13th, 1962 died August 10th, 2006. Beloved son, brother, uncle and dear friend. Showed exceptional strength and courage in his battle against a relentless disease. It was a reflection on how he lived his life. A fine musician, and a fierce competitor on the tennis court and in all he attempted. A great person very well loved and respected. A tremendous loss to all those who knew him.
