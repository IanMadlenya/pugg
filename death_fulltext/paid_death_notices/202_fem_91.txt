        MINCIELI--Millie. On November 11, 2003. Beautiful wife of Michael Mincieli, loving mother of Michael and Dennis, adoring great-grandmother ''GG'' of Jack and Will Allee. She was one of the lucky ones--a lively, beautiful woman blessed with an extraordinarily loving and gentle husband, devoted family, good health and a long life--one week short of 90 years. We will love you always Millie. Mike, Michael, Dennis and Debra Friends may call at Frank E. Campbell on Thursday, November 13, 2 to 4 and 7 to 9 PM. Funeral on Friday, November 14 at St. Ignatius of Loyola Church. Contributions to St. Aloysius Gonzaga Boys Program, 223 W. 132 St.
