        KEENAN-Marie T., 74. Died Saturday in White Plains surrounded by her family. Marie was an inspiration to her three daughters Terry Keenan Kass and Linda Erin Keenan of Manhattan, and Joellen Keenan Gardner of Albany. She worked full time running her own business and still found plenty of time to be a loving mother. Marie was especially devoted to her four grandsons James Patrick Keenan, Nicholas and Andrew Gardner, and Benjamin Keenan Kass. She will be dearly missed by her two surviving sisters, and 18 nieces and nephews. Friends can call from 4-8 PM Tuesday at the Hearley Funeral Home in Albany, NY. Funeral services will be held on Wednesday at 10 AM at St. Mary's Church in Albany.
