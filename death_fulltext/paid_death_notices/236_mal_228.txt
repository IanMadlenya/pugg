        LUBELL--Nathaniel, 90 of Fort Lee, NJ died in his home on Sat., Sept. 17th. He was the beloved stepfather of Robert Dow, of Tuxedo Park, NY and Lawrenceville, NJ, and the beloved uncle of David Buskin of NYC; John Buskin of Montclair, NJ; David Lubell of Ossining, NY; Elizabeth Kozart of Philadelphia, PA; Jack Kaplan of NYC; and Gail Kaplan of NYC. Loved and respected also by the spouses and children of all the above, he represented the last vestige of his generation to his large extended family. Nathaniel Lubell was born in 1916. He graduated from the City College of New York, where he first began to achieve renown as a world-class fencer. His 1936 CCNY Fencing Team won the New York City Championships, and he is a member of the CCNY Athletic Hall of Fame. He went on to become a three-time Olympian ( 1948, '52 and '56 ). He was the U.S. National Foil Champion in 1948, and at the 1951 Pan American Games, he won the bronze medal in the individual foil and helped the team capture the gold medal in the team foil and saber. He was a lifelong member of The New York Fencers' Club, serving as its President during the 1970's. He also coached fencing at West Point from 1962-1966. Fiercely independent and aggressively iconoclastic, his acerbic wit and characteristic irascibility were a source of considerable family lore. He was an institution among his many descendants, and he will be greatly missed.
