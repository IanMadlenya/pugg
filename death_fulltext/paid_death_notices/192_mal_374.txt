        SOLOMON-Irving I. January 28, 2003, in his 84th year of a life fully enjoyed. He was first the husband of the late Frieda Solomon who together were the parents of Maxinne (Irwin), Stephanie, Marc and Charisse and the grandparents of Lori, Gayle, Debra, Jason and Joshua, all of whom survive him and the late Adam. In terrible sadness, he leaves to mourn him as well his second wife, Shira Stein, who in the renaissance of his life helped Irving to believe that love can happen again. He is also survived by Wallace Jordan, whom he mentored and cared about deeply. Irving was special to so many, by dint of his patience and wise counsel, his unflagging optimism, his devotion to his family and all that he contributed in trying to make this world a more reasoned and compassioned place. We are blessed that the Eternal took him gently....this kind and wonderful man. A memorial service will be held at Temple Shaaray Tefila, 250 East 79th Street on Thursday, January 30, at 4PM. Contributions in Irving's memory may be made to the Rabbi's Discretionary Fund or the Cantor's Discretionary Fund at Temple Shaaray Tefila.
