        KETCHAM--William T. The Governors, membership and staff of The Rockaway Hunting Club note with sorrow the death of our esteemed fellow member of sixty-five years, William Tredwell Ketcham, Jr. A many time Club champion in squash and tennis, Treddy was the longest serving Club president (1987-2003) in our history, a wise and progressive leader, and a friend to all with whom he came in contact, young and old alike. He can never be replaced and will be sorely missed. We send our heartfelt condolences to his family. Arthur C.A. Nicol, President
