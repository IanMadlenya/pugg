        SEVUSH-David. With his passing on January 19th, 1998, the world became a poorer place. Born on June 29, 1922, he fought for his country in World War II and returned from the Pacific to marry and raise a family. Though he had to leave school during the Depression, he was a lover of learning and returned to school in his later years, receiving a college degree from Kingsborough Community College at the age of 65. Throughout his life, he was an active and integral part of his beloved Brooklyn through his involvement with the Boy Scouts, Youth Baseball, Coney Island Community Council, and the Sea Gate Community Council and Board of Directors. He was a passionate and tireless advocate for the truth. He is survived by his bride of fifty years, Norma; their three sons, Steve, Herb and Ralph; their daughters-in-law Elaine, Aline and Tobe; their four grandchildren Jeremy, Jennifer, David and Jamie; his two younger brothers, Leo and Jack, and relatives, friends, neighbors and coworkers who mourn their loss. Services will be held at Parkside Memorial Chapel, Flatbush Avenue and Avenue V in Brooklyn on Wednesday, January 21 at 11:30 AM. The family requests, in lieu of flowers, contributions may be made in his name to the charity of their choice.
