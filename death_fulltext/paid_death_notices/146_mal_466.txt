        HIDALGO-Arthur J.. With profound sadness, we mourn the passing of Arthur J. Hidalgo, Vice President of Student Affairs and Administration. In our hearts, he can not be replaced. Through his wit, his intelligence, and his commitment to education, he made our time with him an enriching experience. Arthur's dedication to excellence, wealth of ideas and tireless hard work was, and is, an inspiration to all of us. He was the keystone and anchor for all of our efforts and he touched the lives of all of the students, staff, faculty and administration of our school. In the words of school President Alex Shchegol, ''he built this school.'' Arthur, as a friend and colleague, you will always be missed but never forgotten. The administration, faculty, staff and students of ASA Institute of Business & Computer Technology
