        GENSEL-The Rev. John Garcia. The pastors, people and staff of Saint Peter's Church, 619 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, mourn the death of our Pastor Emeritus John Garcia Gensel. We give thanks to God for his life, his faith and his gifts as our Pastor and as the ''Shepherd of the Night Flock'' who cared for, supported and served members of the jazz community and who pioneered jazz both as an art form and as a medium for worship. We rejoice that he now shares fully in the abundant life of Christ which he so joyfully proclaimed. In celebration of Pastor Gensel's life and ministry, Saint Peter's Church announces the establishment of the John Garcia Gensel Memorial Jazz Fund for the support of both the artistic and spiritual dimensions of jazz. We encourage all of Pastor Gensel's friends and supporters to allow time for his beloved wife Audrey and his family to mourn in private. In consultation with the Gensel family, we plan two memorial services for Pastor Gensel at Saint Peter's Church. A Mass of the Resurrection on Saturday, April 18, 1998 and a jazz celebration on Sunday, April 19, 1998. Amandus J. Derr, Senior Pastor Saint Peter's Church 619 Lexington Avenue New York, NY 10022-4610
