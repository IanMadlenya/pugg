        ELLIS-Larry. The New York Road Runners Club mourns the passing of our friend Larry Ellis, a pillar of the sport of track and field and long distance running. A runner of star quality, he used his talents to develop and coach generations of new runners and Olympic athletes. His administrative skills helped bring this sport to a new level. We and the entire running community will miss him greatly. Allan Steinfeld, President and CEO New York Road Runners Club
