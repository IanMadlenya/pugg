        KALLIR--Lilian. All of us at ICM Artists mourn the loss of pianist Lilian Kallir, a great artist and a remarkable human being. Our hearts go out to her beloved husband, Claude Frank and her daughter, Pamela Frank. Claude and Pam tended to her so lovingly as she fought valiantly during her long and terrible illness. Peace to her memory. David V. Foster President and CEO Byron Gustafson Executive Vice President Jenny Vogel Executive Vice President Patricia A. Winter Senior Vice President
