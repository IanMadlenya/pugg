Dr. Kerner was Emeritus Professor of Physics at the University of Delaware, having retired in 1999 after 37 years of service as a Professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy. Dr. Kerner was born in New York City on April 22, 1924. He earned a Bachelor's Degree from Columbia College in 1943, and a Ph.D in Physics from Cornell University in 1950. Dr. Kerner was interested in theoretical physics very broadly. He studied and contributed significant research results in biophysics, relativity, gravity, and the foundations of quantum mechanics. Recently, he had published an article and was working on others in the area of uniform field theory, i.e., how particles and waves interact at a subatomic level. He was preceded in death by son Jeffrey C. Kerner. He is survived by his wife Barbara B. Kerner; brother George H. Kerner; son Benjamin Kerner; and daughter Winifred Kerner.
