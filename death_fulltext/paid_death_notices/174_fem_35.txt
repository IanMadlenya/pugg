        FENSTERSTOCK-Gertrude. We extend heartfelt condolences to Blair and Jason Fensterstock on the loss of their beloved mother. Gertrude combined an inner strength, love of life and keen intellect, with an intense devotion to Israel and the Jewish people. As a Platinum Founder and a generous supporter of the Jesselson Heart Center and the Nuclear Medicine Institute, her outstretched hand of kindness and warm smile helped to provide ultra-modern and compassionate healing to thousands. May the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Amer. Comm. for Shaare Zedek Med. Ctr. in Jerusalem
