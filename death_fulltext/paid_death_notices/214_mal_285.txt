        WACHTLER -- Morton. He was always concerned with the needs of others. Most of those needs were filled with his love and compassion, a need which only he could fill and one which will not diminish with time. We were blessed by having and loving him as a brother, and will always be grateful for his legacy of strength and devotion. Joan and Sol
