        BLOOM--Frances Roller. The Chapin School community is deeply saddened by the death of Frances Roller Bloom, Chapin's Director of Studies and mother of the late Haven Bloom, Class of 2002. A dedicated and distinguished faculty member since 1973, she became Head of the History Department, a member of the Administrative Team and Director of Studies. Among her greatest gifts to our school were her scholarship and her unbounded devotion to her students. We extend our profound sympathy to her husband, Barry, and to her entire family. Ella M. Foshay '65 President, Board of Trustees Dr. Patricia T. Hayot, Head of School
