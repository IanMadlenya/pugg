        DONNENFELD-Hyman, MD. The Medical Staff of Saint Vincents Hospital and Medical Center of New York expresses its deep sorrow at the loss of one of its most honored and respected members, Dr. Hyman Donnenfeld. Dr. Donnenfeld enjoyed a thiry-year career with Saint Vincents as a Neurologist and Neuropathologist, for many years serving as the Chief of Neurosciences and Neuropathology. Born in Quebec, he trained at Ottawa University, followed by a Fellowship at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center from 1964-67, before starting his association with Saint Vincents. Dr. Donnenfeld will be remembered as an accomplished and caring physician as well as superb teacher and compassionate human being. His gifts, skills, friendship and humor will be dearly missed, and his absence sorely felt by the caregivers, administrative staff and patients of Saint Vincents. We express our heartfelt condolences to Dr. Donnenfeld's family, his daughters Caroline and Sherry, and his son, David. Eduardo M. Gonzalez, MD, Pres. for the Medical Staff of Saint Vincents Hospital and Medical Center
