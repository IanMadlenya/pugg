        CAPOLARELLO--Grace Auditore (December 11, 1920January 3, 2005). Mom would often end a phone conversation with us with the words ''Do everything right.'' How appropriate since that is how she tried to live her life by doing the right thing, always. Mom was the most optimistic person we knew. Her cheerful disposition and optimism had a childlike quality, yet she was also the most maternal person we knew. Strangers she met would easily tell her their troubles and she made them feel relieved and comforted. Needless to say she was a source of comfort for her family as well. She was our home base. She was our heart. A big piece of us goes with her and yet so much more of her will remain with us forever. Let us remember her playing in Cobble Hill, going to school, becoming a beautiful young woman, and going to Giardini, Italy, through Naples to marry our father, nervous and bewildered. Let us remember her walking on Court Street on Sundays with her husband and 3 children, going to the Court Street Pastry Shop and then stopping by her sister Annette's home with some fresh biscotti and lemon ice. Let us remember her in the early fall, the cold of winter and when spring then summer came and the light, smells and sounds changed, smiling proud of her life and her family. Mom, we love you & will remember you always. Love, Joe, Rita, & in spirit, Dominick
