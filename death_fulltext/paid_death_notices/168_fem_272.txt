        WOLF-Roslyn Zehman. The Officers, Board and Staff of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) mourn the passing of the beloved wife of our distinguished past President Ambassador Milton A. Wolf. She worked with her husband to provide assistance to those in need throughout the world. When her husband represented the United States as U.S. Ambassador to the Federal Republic of Austria, she served with him in Vienna. She was the leader of the spouses of the 105 ambassadors serving in Vienna, where she hosted the SALT II talks, attended by Presidents Carter and Brezhnev. Mrs. Wolf will be remembered for her warmth, generosity, and extraordinary good will. Mrs. Wolf had a lifetime involvement with the Jewish community and truly embodied the quality of a ''Woman of Valor.'' We extend our heartfelt condolences to her husband, children, grandchildren, family and friends. Eugene Ribakoff, President Jonathan W. Kolker, Bd Chrmn Michael Schneider, Exec V.P.
