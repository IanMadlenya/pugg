        LEVENSON-Ruth A. Those at Columbia University's Heyman Center for the Humanities and the Society of Senior Scholars express their great sense of loss at the death October 18 of our colleague and friend Ruth A. Levenson, former Associate Director of the Center. Her intelligence and energy encouraged in countless ways the work done there, and she will be sorely missed. Wm. Theodore de Bary Carl F. Hovde,
