        WALTON--John T. It is with great sadness that the InnerCity Scholarship Fund family notes the passing of one of the founders of Children's Scholarship Fund. We are so grateful for Mr. Walton's profound commitment to children-in-need throughout the country, and especially to those boys and girls in the Archdiocese of New York. Without the help of Children's Scholarship Fund and his own championing of school vouchers, thousands of children would not be attending the schools of their choice. His generous spirit will never be forgotten. Our hearts go out to his wife, Christy, son Luke, and the entire Walton family in this time of loss.
