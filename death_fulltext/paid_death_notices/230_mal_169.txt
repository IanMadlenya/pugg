        YANOFF--Allen, a quintessential physician; he was the doctor's doctor. We went to him for advice about pedestrian problems because his judgement was sound and unerring. We went to him to discuss matters of extraodinary medical complexity, seeking and finding solutions that were not to be found in journal articles, textbooks or perhaps anywhere else. He was mindful of the need to keep high-quality medical care alive, and to this end he championed a Medicare voucher system as a means of revitalizing our ailing healthcare system. He was tough, never complained even when facing bleak prospects and worked until the day before he died. He was a great doctor.
