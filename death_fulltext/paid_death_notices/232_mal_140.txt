        TORSNEY--Gerard F. We mourn the passing of our dear friend and colleague, Gerard F. Torsney, on April 29, 2006. We will greatly miss Gerry's brilliant counsel, wit, and repartee. He was an educated gentleman, whose generosity, compassion and integrity is a loss for all. Gerry was truly the finest example for all to aspire. Our deepest sympathies to Gerry's brothers, Denis and Tim Tornsey, and their families. A Memorial Service followed by a champagne and food reception will be held at 6:30 P.M. on Saturday May 20 in the Landsdowne Room, Burlington Hotel, Dublin. In lieu of flowers, donations in Gerry's honor may be made to: Save The Children, PO Box 940, Westport, CT. 06880. As a legacy to Gerry, the family requests anecdotes, stories, unique memories and photos be sent to: inmemoryofgerry@ yahoo.com
