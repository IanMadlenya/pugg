        ROSS--Frederick Jerome. It is with great sadness and a deep sense of loss that we say goodbye to our devoted friend Frederick Jerome Ross. We are sure that all of his dear friends at the Great Neck Senior Center where he was an active board member for 20 years would like to join us in bidding him a fond farewell. He will be profoundly missed by his ''lady'' Evelyn Barkin and her family; Ellen and Ronald Perelman, George and Lana Barkin, Jack and Romy Byrne, Samantha and Caleigh Perelman and Deborah and Gideon Gil. He brought love and joy to all who knew him and we feel blessed to have had him in our lives. ''I shall miss you my darling and will hold you in my heart as I know you hold me in yours.''
