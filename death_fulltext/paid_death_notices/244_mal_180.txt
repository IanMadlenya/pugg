        GRAHAM--Colin (1931-2007). Opera Theatre of St. Louis dedicates the 2007 season to the memory of Colin Graham, our artistic director since 1985. An acclaimed director and librettist, he was ''a force in living opera,'' staging 48 new OTSL productions and a record 56 world premiers in the US and the UK. He advanced the careers of many young artist and will be sorely missed.
