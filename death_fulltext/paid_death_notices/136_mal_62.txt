A remarkable clinical specialist in contact lens therapy for more than 4 decades, he built a program at the SUNY College of Optometry and was renowned nationally & internationally, as a teacher and scholar, in an emerging field of visual function. He was an original staff professional in the Optometric Center of New York with a fervent devotion to his students, to his colleagues and to his institution that was unwavering in his commitments and unstinting in his professional and personal friendships.
