        WALLER--Wilhelmine Stewart Kirby. The Officers and Directors of The Garden Club of America express deep sorrow on the death of their former President, Wilhelmine Kirby Waller, and extend deepest sympathy to her family and friends. She served the Garden Club with great distinction and extraordinary ability as its 17th president (1965 to 1968) and in many other capacities that began with her membership in the Bedford Garden Club. Her most memorable contributions were in the area of environmental legislation on both local and national levels. She served tirelessly on many national and state commissions and held a seat on the President's Citizen Advisory Council on Environmental Quality under three presidential administrations --Nixon, Ford and George H. Bush. She is credited with the formation of the Garden Club's National Affairs and Legislation Committee, which has been active for many years in promoting sound conservation policy through legislation. Mrs Waller made considerable contributions to the Garden Club, to Westchester County, to New York State and to the Nation. She will be remembered fondly by the many people whose lives she touched.
