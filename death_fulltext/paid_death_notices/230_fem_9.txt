        NOETHER - Hannah. We mourn the loss of a cherished friend. For 25 years Mrs. Noether expertly arranged the program for our Annual Concert and brought the majesty of classical music to New York. Blessed with an uncanny ability to recognize upand-coming talent, she featured virtuosos who were destined for greatness. A Golden Founder, she will be greatly missed. May the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. American Committee for Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem
