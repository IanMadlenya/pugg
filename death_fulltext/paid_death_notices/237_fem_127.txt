        FAJEN--Marion. The employees, management and Directors of American International Group, Inc. (AIG) are deeply saddened by the death of our dear friend and long-time colleague, Marion Fajen. Marion served AIG for many years in a number of roles, including as Corporate Secretary, Vice President and a member of the Board of Directors, the first woman to be named an AIG Director. She believed her selection for that position was an incentive to other women in the organization, demonstrating what hard work and dedication could do. Marion retired from AIG in 1986 and moved to Iowa, but she remained a member of the Board of Directors until May 1994. Marion had a significant impact on the organization and on the lives of many AIG people. Her wise counsel was heard not only at Board meetings and in senior management discussions, but also privately with ther peers and associates in the Law Department. Marion was a mentor to many and a friend to all. She loved AIG and contributed importantly to the company in many ways. She was, to all uf us, a very special person and we will miss her. Marion's husband William died in 1998. She is survived by their four children, Richard, James, John and Catherine, and ten grandchildren. We extend our deepest sympathies to Marion's family and friends. For those who might wish to remember Marion, her family has suggested that contributions be made to either Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, P.O. Box 27106, New York, NY 10087, or to Hospice of Central Iowa, 401 Railroad Place, West Des Moines, IA 50312. Martin J. Sullivan President and CEO American International Group, Inc.
