        BELFER-Ben, Cantor. The President, Chancellor, Boards of Governors and Overseers, faculty, administration and students of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion records with profound sorrow the death of Cantor Ben Belfer, beloved faculty member of the School of Sacred Music for more than four decades. The recipient of the first Master Degree awarded by the School of Sacred Music, Cantor Belfer was a gifted composer and teacher who nurtured generations of S.S.M. students. May his memory be a blessing. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his dear wife, Florence, and daughter, Cantor Shira Belfer. May they find comfort together with all those who mourn for Zion and Jerusalem. Rabbi Sheldon Zimmerman, Pres. Burton Lehman, Chair, Board of Governors Cantor Israel Goldstein, Dir., School of Sacred Music
