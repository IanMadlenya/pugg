        KANTOR--Thomas. The faculty and staff of NYU School of Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, express their deep sadness over the death of Thomas Kantor, M.D., a distinguished member of the faculty for over 50 years. Dr. Kantor achieved international recognition for his contributions to rheumatology, especially for his seminal descriptions of connective tissue diseases and their treatments. Dr. Kantor, who embodied the finest traditions of the medical profession throughout his career, was an inspiring teacher and raconteur. Generations of NYU-trained rheumatologists will always treasure his morning rounds at Bellevue Hospital where with wit and wisdom he taught them that the secret of patient care was to care for the patient. Dr. Kantor will always be remembered with respect and admiration. Our deepest sympathies go to his wife, Deirdre, and the entire Kantor family.
