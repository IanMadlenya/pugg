        RUBENSTEIN-Jean Evans. Died at her home in Lexington, MA. January 20, 2000 attended by her husband Neal and children Elizabeth and David Edward. Born in San Diego, CA., the daughter of Dr. Edward Ellsworth Evans, U.S.N., and Elvira Jeannette Thurlow, both deceased, she grew up in many places, meeting her husband when they were at Reed College together. Jean was the Executive Secretary of Mass. PAX in the '60s and '70s, an active opponent of the war in Vietnam, worked for Shirley Chisholm for President, and was an Aide to Paul Tsongas for more than twenty years, beginning as his Executive in Middlesex County. She did these things because she knew they were necessary, the right things to do. As Paul said, ''She took the moral high ground and let the rest of us fend for ourselves.'' Jean had a deep love and a fierce loyalty for her friends and family, and in her last years, delighted mostly in two grandchildren, Rachel and Evan.
