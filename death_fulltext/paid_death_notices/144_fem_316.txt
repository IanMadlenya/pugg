        McCANN-Helen M.. The Barnard College Community mourns the death of Helen M. McCann, class of 1940, and Director of Admissions at the College from 1952 until 1977. To College counselors and school heads across the country, and to twenty-five classes of Barnard Alumnae, the name of Helen McCann was synonymous with Barnard. In her years at the College, Ms. McCann supported and advanced the mission of the College with her uncompromising committment to excellence and to access based on individual promise and achievement. We remember her fine intelligence, wit, and devotion to the College and extend our heartfelt sympathy to her sister Maureen McCann Miletta, class of 1950 and nieces Alexandra Miletta and Jennifer Miletta Adams, class of 1986.
