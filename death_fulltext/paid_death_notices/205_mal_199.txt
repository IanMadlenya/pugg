        MATHERLY -- John. The Trustees and Staff of The Hudson River Museum record with great sorrow the passing of John Matherly, Design Director at the Museum since 1981. Through his wide ranging skills he influenced every aspect of the Museum's public face. He will be sorely missed. Our thoughts go out to Laura, Evan, Justin.
