        FELDMAN - Vita. The Trustees, Faculty, and Staff of The Mount Sinai Medical Center are saddened by the passing of Vita Feldman. Vita, together with her late husband Gus, founded The Jack Martin Fund, which has supported important programs at Mount Sinai for more than 50 years. Through the efforts of the Feldman family and their colleagues in the apparel industry, The Jack Martin Fund made its first contribution to Mount Sinai in 1952 to purchase equipment to treat polio. More recently, Alan Feldman, Vita and Gus's son, and a group of dedicated colleagues under Alan's leadership, created The Jack Martin Fund Clinic, and are endowing the Division of Oncology in The Jack and Lucy Clark Department of Pediatrics. Vita Feldman's personal generosity, and her family's commitment to Mount Sinai, will long be remembered. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Alan Feldman and the entire family. Peter W. May, Chairman of the Board, The Mount Sinai Medical Center Kenneth I. Berns, M.D., Ph.D., President and CEO, The Mount Sinai Medical Center Larry H. Hollier, M.D., President, The Mount Sinai Hospital Kenneth L. Davis, M.D., Dean, Mount Sinai School of Medicine
