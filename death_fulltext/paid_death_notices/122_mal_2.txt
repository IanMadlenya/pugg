        COHEN-Judah, a very special person whose life was devoted and dedicated to his children. His never ending concern and pride in his children, unwavering respect for his father and sensitivity to the needs of others will be his legacy. He will be sorely missed. May Shlomo Chani, Avi and Max be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Family and Friends
