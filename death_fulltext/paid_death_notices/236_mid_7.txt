        STERN--Pearl. The Yeshiva University family laments the demise of a wonderful Jewish communal leader who, with her late husband, Israel Stern, was a YU Guardian and his partner in developing the Upstate New York YU dinners and established scholarships for deserving and needy students. Heartfelt condolences are extended to her devoted son, Jules (and Lila) Stern, and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel, President Norman Lamm, Chancellor Morry J. Weiss, Chairman Board of Trustees
