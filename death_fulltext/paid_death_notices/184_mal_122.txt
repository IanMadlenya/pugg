        LOHF-Kenneth A. The members of the Council of The Grolier Club are deeply saddened by the loss of Kenneth A. Lohf, a member since 1961. In addition to heading many of the Club's committees, he served on the Council from 1987 to 2002 and was president from 1990 to 1994. We will sorely miss the guidance and sage advice of this skilled librarian, passionate collector, shrewd administrator and consummate bookman. Carolyn L. Smith, President Eric J. Holzenberg, Director and Librarian
