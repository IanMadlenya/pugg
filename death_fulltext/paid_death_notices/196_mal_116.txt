        ANGELIDES - Alexander Constantine, M.D., March 16, 1934 to May 11, 2003. Passed away peacefully surrounded by his loving family after a courageous battle with cancer. Born in Berlin, New Hamsphire, to Greek immigrant parents, he was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Amherst College and a graduate of Cornell Medical College. He went on to fellowship training in hand surgery with Dr. Robert E. Carroll and opened his practice in the South Florida area in 1968. He went on to develop a successful group practice and throughout his thirty years became a prominent surgeon and a published author in his specialty of orthopedic hand surgery. He was a member of the prestigious American Society for Surgery of the Hand. He was a co-founder and Chief of Staff of Palmetto General Hospital. He traveled the four corners of the world in quest of his love of life, culture and art. He was an avid skier and sailor. He was a gifted artist, painting until the end of his life. He was also an accomplished photographer who had the rare privilege to be trained by Ansel Adams. He was a patron of the fine and performing arts in both South Florida and New York. His last great journey was to Antarctica shadowing the trail of Shackelton's adventure on the ship ''Endurance''. Through this adventure Alex embodied the true meaning of the word ''endurance'', carrying this inherent courage through his battle with cancer. He is survived by his loving daughters, Alexandria, Christina and Nicole and his loving grandchildren, Austin, Isabel, Hannah, Gillian and Elijah Alexander. A private memorial service will follow.
