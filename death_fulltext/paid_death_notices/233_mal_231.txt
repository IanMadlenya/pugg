        LAMB--Bill. The Trustees, Staff and Volunteers of Educational Broadcasting Corporation (EBC) lament the passing of Bill Lamb, one of the founding members of EBC's flagship station, Thirteen/WNET. A member of the team that brought Thirteen/WNET to life in 1962, Bill also oversaw the creation of some of public televisions most outstanding offerings, including: ''Nature,'' ''Great Performances,'' ''American Playhouse,'' ''The Brain'' and ''Heritage: Civilization and the Jews.'' We join his companion, Marcie Setlow, and his family in mourning the loss of a dear friend and colleague. Steven Rattner Chairman William F. Baker President
