        STACK-J. Philip. The Vision Fund of America (VFA) is deeply saddened by the passing of Phil Stack, a founding member and first Chairman. Through the VFA, Phil, a retiree of the Sony Corp., worked tirelessly to encourage professionals within visual media industries, to ''give something back.'' For nearly twenty years, VFA's support of Lighthouse International has assisted in promoting independence for individuals who are blind or partially sighted. We extend our sincere condolences to his wife, Gayle. Donations may be made in his honor to the VFA Memorial Funds, 111 East 59th Street, New York, New York 10022.
