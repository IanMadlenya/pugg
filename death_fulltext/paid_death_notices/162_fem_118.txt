        SPECTOR-Ruth. Those of us who were privileged enough to have Ruth Spector touch our lives were blessed. She taught us through example what it meant to be an exemplary human being. No one was a better wife to Walter, mother to Alice and Susan, a devoted daughter to Benjamin and Gussie, a wonderful grandmother to Glenn, Felisa, Robin, Stefanie and Samantha, a caring mother-in-law to Roy and Ron and a joyful greatgrandmother to Savannah. She loved her brother Harry and her sisters Beverly and Lillian without reservation. A special thank you to her dear friend Ed. The hole she left in our hearts will never mend. We love you Mommy. A. and S. Services today, 1:00 PM at ''Gutterman's'', 8000 Jericho Turnpike, Woodbury, Long Island.
