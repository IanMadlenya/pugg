        MARCUS-Stanley. The Board of Directors and staff of the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum are deeply saddened by the passing of Stanley Marcus, one of the Museum's first Board members. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to his wife, Linda, who is currently a member of our Board, and to his family. Stanley's generous support, leadership, enthusiasm, friendship and keen artistic judgment were instrumental in the Museum's inception and success. We shall miss him greatly.
