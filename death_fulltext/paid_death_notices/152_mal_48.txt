        MANDRAKOS-Leo. The Trustees, Fellows and staff of the Manhattan Institute greatly mourn the loss of our good friend Leo Mandrakos. ''He held his seat; a friend to human race. Fast by the road, his ever open door obliged the wealthy, and relieved the poor.'' Homer. We shall miss him-his passionate ideals and practical support-and our hearts and prayers are with his family.
