        FINK-Jack. We record with deep sorrow the passing of one of our dearest friends and major benefactors. A Holocaust survivor, Mr. Fink's devotion to Am Yisrael, Torat Yisrael and Eretz Yisrael was exemplified by his most generous sponsorship of several significant projects at YBA Or Etzion, Meron and Ner Tamid. May his deeds live on as a shining example for all who knew him. May the family be consoled among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. American Friends of Yeshivot Bnei Akiva
