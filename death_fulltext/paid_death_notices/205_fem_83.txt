        BIMEL--Natalie. The Board and staff of the Correctional Association mourn the untimely death of Natalie Bimel, our friend and colleague in advocating on behalf of the vulnerable and powerless people caught up in the criminal justice system. Natalie's tireless commitment to social justice, her personal honesty, her vital spirit, and her unfailing good humor endeared her to us over the years, inspire us now, and will do so into the future.
