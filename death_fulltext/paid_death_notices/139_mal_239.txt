        NEWMAN-Norman, Esq. Yeshiva of South Shore and its affiliates are deeply saddened by the passing of our beloved, dedicated president, who served our organization with devotion and distinction. Norman was a devoted husband, father, son and brother whose brilliant mind and compassionate heart were always available to help others. He was an exemplary community leader who, as president of the Yeshiva, helped us forge our way into the next century. He will be greatly missed. Rabbi Benjamin Kamenetzky Dean
