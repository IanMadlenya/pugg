        JOSEPH-Robert L. Writer and producer, age 79. A totally cerebral, extraordinary mensch with an inquiring mind, never satisifed with the ''pat'' answer. An intellectual surgeon who drew much more out of people than they felt they had. Always a playwright and author searching for a different dimension. A catalyst who brought people together and brought people to him. From that special generation of theater people -the wonderful greats -a world of theater which is no longer with us, and of which he was a part. A man who never censored what he had to say. A man who left pople feeling loved and worthy. Died Monday, April 29, the result of head injuries sustained in a fall at his home in East Chatham, NY, April 27. A memorial will be held in NYC at 333 East 56th St, 12 noon, Friday, May 10.
        JOSEPH-Robert L. March 10, 1923-April 29, 2002. Our esteemed cousin: a remarkable character. A man with an extraordinary mind and a sharp, often hilarious wit. He cared deeply about progressive causes and politics, and passionately about the Jewish people. Bob never tired of participating in heated discussions, whether current events, history, or literature, and, of course, theater, movies or TV. Perhaps, above all, was Bob's involvement with his family. Particularly late in his life, Bob kept in touch with all of us. He kept us thinking and laughing, and certainly, by prodding us to be in touch, helped us to love each other. He will be sorely missed. The Haft cousins: J. David, Elsie Jane, Billy, Ann, Judith, Burt, Richard, Norman, Bobby and Herbert; and with ongoing love, respect, and affection for our special cousin Phyllis Joseph
