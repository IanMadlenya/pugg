        VASTESAEGER-Maria R., M.D., passed away at the age of 55 at her home in Scotch Plains, New Jersey, on June 28, 2002. Beloved wife of Dr. Balendu Vasavada and cherished mother of Jasmine, Natasha, and Zubin, Mia is also survived by her parents, Lodewyk Vastesaeger and Bertha Martens of Leuven, Belgium, and her nine sisters and brothers. An internist by vocation, an artist by avocation, she was happiest in her garden and her workshop. She had a rare gift for combining the whimsical and the practical, and her boundless creativity brightened everything she touched.
