        ALEXANDER--Nicholas, died July 12 at home at age 81 after a life of adventure beginning in Romania, taking many dramatic turns, and successfully ending in the United States--the country he loved and whose citizen he chose to become. Professionally a civil engineer and entrepreneur; at heart a soccer player and outdoorsman; and to the many who so loved him a constant presence of love, acceptance, tranquility, and groundedness. Survived by his devoted wife of 49 years, Mary; his only daughter, Raluca; his dearest grandchildren Raleigh and Percy; and his son-in-law, Jody. He will be sorely missed and always remembered. Private services will be held for the immediate family.
