        TICHNOR-Alan J. The United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism mourns the passing of Alan J. Tichnor, International President of the United Synagogue from 1989 to 1993 and longtime leader of the USCJ, New England Region. The driving force behind creative religious and educational programs, he was steadfast in his devotion to Jewish living and to the State of Israel. Respected both for his kindness and his compassion, he will long be remembered not only for his tireless efforts on behalf of the Jewish community, but also for his desire to share his love of Conservative Judaism with all he met. We extend our sincere condolences to his wife Marjorie and his children Susan and Howard Alfred, Michael and Karen Tichnor, Amy, and Nancy and Sidney Lejfer, as well as their families. Stephen S. Wolnek, Int'l Pres. Rabbi Jerome M. Epstein, Executive Vice-President
