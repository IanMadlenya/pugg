        VEERHUSEN-Pamela. The volunteers and staff of Planned Parenthood Federation of America deeply mourn the death of our friend and colleague, Pamela Veerhusen. Passionately committed to the health and rights of women, she joined Planned Parenthood in 1956 and served in a variety of roles at the local and national levels for 40 years, becoming a model for several generations of family planning activists. The Planned Parenthood family will miss her warmth, wisdom and humanity. Our deepest sympathy is extended to her family.
