        GURFEIN--Jay J., passed peacefully in his sleep March 9, 2007. Our mighty oak has fallen, but his spirit lingers on. Jay enriched all who knew him, lovingly sharing his knowledge and wit. He had an elegant presence and great love of family, giving pleasure wherever he walked. Very charismatic, filled with high energy and joy of life. The legal profession has lost one of its eagles. He will be missed by all those he touched. Beloved husband of Maggie, loving father to Michelle, Robin, Jim, and the departed Doug. Fun loving grandfather to Jackson, Dillon and Cameron. Son-in-law to Randy and Josh, sister-inlaw to Ginger and Linda, brother-in-law to Joe and Al, wonderful brother to Helene. You will never leave our hearts.
