If you needed something fixed--''just ask Kitty, she'll do it.'' A devoted wife to our late father Jack and his constant companion for over 62 years, she thrived on her very special relationships with her sons, Michael and Stewart, their wives Cheryl and Phyllis, her four grandchildren and her four greatgrandchildren. Mom, we will remember you always for being our tower of strength and setting the standard for all of us. We will miss you dearly. Memorial contributions may be made to the Mount Sinai Visiting Doctors program.
