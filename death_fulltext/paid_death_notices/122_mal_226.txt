        DYSON-Charles H. The board of trustees and staff of the Metropolitan Opera Association mourn with profound sadness the loss of Charles H. Dyson, distinguished managing director of the board for more than a decade until his retirement in 1996. We recall with great affection his personal enjoyment of the Metropolitan Opera and his dedication to the Met, both as a board member and as a generous leader in our activities, including the Centennial Fund, Silver Anniversary Fund and our Golden Horseshoe Program. His example will continue to be an inspiration for generations to come. We deeply appreciate the Dyson National Council Endowment Fund recognizing his commitment to nurturing the talents of young artists seeking careers in opera, especially the Metropolitan Opera. He will be missed by all his friends and colleagues. We extend our deepest condolences to the entire Dyson family. James W. Kinnear, Chairman of the Board Bruce Crawford, President and Chief Exec.
