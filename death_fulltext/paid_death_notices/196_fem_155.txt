        SILVERSTEIN - Sadie. The Yeshiva University family is saddened by the passing of a compassionate, kind, generous and long-time friend and supporter of Jewish education who, with her late husband, Rabbi Israel I. Silverstein (a former Trustee of the affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary), was a Yeshiva University Guardian who memorialized their late, beloved son, Dr. Jerrold Silverstein, with a science laboratory in Yeshiva College and an endowed scholarship fund at RIETS. Heartfelt condolences are extended to her devoted daughter Lorraine (and Dr. Leonard) Dauber; and to her grandchildren: Paul Dauber, Jane (and Michael) Lewittes, and Daniel (and Dina) Dauber. May the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University Ronald P. Stanton, Chairman YU Board of Trustees Julius Berman, Chairman RIETS Board of Trustees Joshua Muss, Chairman YC Board of Directors
