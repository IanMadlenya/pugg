        WOOD--Paul W. The officers, board and congregation of Temple Emanuel mourn the passing of Paul W. Wood and extend heartfelt condolences to Jacqueline Wood and her family. Paul's artistry and insight into the deeper meaning of Jewish symbols are concretized in the magnificent stained glass windows, ark and eternal light that grace our sanctuary. As we are moved by his works on levels that are intellectual and emotional, so we responded to the man, whose keen mind and gentle ways nourished and inspired us. May his memory be a benediction. Funeral Service is at St. Peter's Church, 1327 Port Washington Boulevard, Port Washington on Saturday, August 30 at 9:30 AM. Dr. Robert S. Widom, Rabbi Mandell Dalis, President Temple Emanuel of Great Neck
