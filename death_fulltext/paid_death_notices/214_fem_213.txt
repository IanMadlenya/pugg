        STONE -- Lyudmila. Passed away November 28, 2004 after a year-long bout with cancer. Beloved daughter of Dr. Zoya Tsukerman and the late Dr. Izyeslav Tsukerman. Dear wife of Andy Stone. Loving mother and motherin-law of Anna and Albert, and best-friend of Mishka. Mila was a person of quiet warmth, strength, and compassion, qualities consistently lived in every facet of her life. These were especially reflected in her involvement in charitable and humanitarian organizations. Throughout her life many sought her council and few were disappointed by her honest, compassionate and forthright advice. Never one to boast about her own hard earned success, she was a modest woman who loved making others happy. She skied, played Mah Jong, and took much joy in entertaining in her home. Mila put her family above all else and we are forever grateful for her profound contemplative generosity. Mila's serenity in approaching her untimely death will forever serve as an inspiration to family and friends. She will be missed and fondly remembered by all those whose lives she touched. Services will be held Tuesday, November 30, 2004 at Wandy Memorial Chapel, 1841 New York Avenue, Huntington Station, NY 11746 at 1PM. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Colon Cancer Alliance, 175 Ninth Ave, New York, N.Y. 10011 or the American Cancer Society 800-ACS-2345.
