        ENDE-Jonathan. His beloved friends mourn his untimely passing. An exceptionally perceptive person, there was never a better or more even-minded friend. He was a man of bizarre carnivorous tastes with all the sensitivity others generally attribute to vegetarians. He had an exuberant curiosity and was a devoted advocate for people with AIDS. Service Sunday, 10AM, Plaza Memorial, 91st Street at Amsterdam Ave.
