Paine, Jr. of Willsboro, a sister, Francisca Paine Irwin, three grandchildren and five great grandchildren. He was the retired CEO of Great Northern Nekoosa Corporation, and a long time director of the Irving Trust Company, Consolidated Edison and Continental Insurance Company. He also served as President of the Museum of the City of New York and as Chairman of The Juilliard School of Music. He was a Board member of Lincoln Center and a trustee of the Astor and Bodmin Foundations, and of Fort Ticonderoga. He was as committed to the conservation of the farms and forests of his native Champlain Valley as he was to the social and economic well being of the area. His efforts led to the conservation of 10,000 acres of working farms and forests and nature preserves, plus some 16 miles of shoreline. A kind gentleman with a sparkling wit, he will be deeply missed by his family, colleagues and friends. Contributions in his memory may be made to: The Juilliard School, the Adirondack Nature Conservancy, Fort Ticonderoga, or the Nature Conservancy of Florida.
