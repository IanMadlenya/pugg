        DANTZKER-Mary L. Born October 18, 1911 in Los Banos, Ca., she died January 10, 2001 in Walnut Creek, Ca. at age 89 after a long illness. She will be remembered lovingly by her husband Morris (Dan), her three children Steven, Bruce and Lynn and her five grandchildren Anna, Alicia, Sarah, Nicholas and Elizabeth. She was intensely devoted to her family and enriched the lives of others who needed a helping hand. She was a strong supporter of a clean environment and enjoyed a special rapport with animals. All who knew her will miss her enthusiasm and panache that pervailed before her illness.
