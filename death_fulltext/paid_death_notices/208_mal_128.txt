        AMOLS--William, M.D. The Department of Neurology of Columbia University deeply regrets the death of William Amols, M.D., on April 20. Dr. Amols trained in neurology at the Neurological Institute of the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center and was chief resident in 1952-1953 before joining the neurology faculty. He retired in 1982 from the Mary Imogene Bassett Hospital, a major teaching affiliate of Columbia University, as clinical professor of neurology. Dr. Amols gained an international reputation for introducing the use of drug therapy for trigeminal neuralgia, a form of facial pain. He was a skilled and devoted clinician and a popular teacher. We extend our condolences to his wife, Jacqueline, and his children. Timothy A. Pedley, M.D. Chairman, Department of Neurology Columbia University Lewis P.
