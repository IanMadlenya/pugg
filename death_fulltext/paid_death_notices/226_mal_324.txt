        FRANKLIN--Ben A. The trustees and staff of the Public Concern Foundation mourn the passing of our great friend and colleague Ben A. Franklin, who served with quiet distinction for more than 12 years as the editor of the Washington Spectator. We extend our deepest sympathies to his widow, Jane, whom we admire for her tenacity, courage and wit, and to his daughters Abigail, Betsy and Clare. We are grateful beyond words to Ben for his constant intelligence, his integrity, his well-aimed indignation, and his gift for language. We will miss him always. Hamilton Fish, President Public Concern Foundation
