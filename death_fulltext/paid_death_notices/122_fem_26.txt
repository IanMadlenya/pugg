        LANGSAM-Annette (nee Kwestel). Age 87. Widow of Nathan Langsam, loving mother of Sara Lee, David and Sandra, adoring grandmother of Melissa and Nina, devoted aunt and great-aunt to Langsam, Schrader and Kwestel families, and caring friend to many in New York and California. Nettie was the last survivor of four siblings, a 1942 graduate of the Columbia University School of Social Work. We will miss her a lot.
