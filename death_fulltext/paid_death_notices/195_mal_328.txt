The Trustees, Faculty, Students and Staff of Poly Prep Country Day School mourn the passing of Edwin Saul Marks, beloved alumnus, Class of 1944, whose generous support led to the construction of The Nancy and Edwin Marks Center for Science & Technology in 2000. Throughout his life, he embodied the essential spirit of Poly-where character supersedes all else. We are deeply saddened and extend our condolences to his wife Nancy; his three daughters, Constance, Carolyn, and Linda; their husbands; and the entire family. Donald Carswell, Chairman David B. Harman, Headmaster Poly Prep Country Day School
