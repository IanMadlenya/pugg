        HOUDE--Raymond W. The staff of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center mourn the death on March 8th of Raymond W. Houde. Dr. Houde served at MSKCC for more than 50 years and was recognized as an international authority on evaluation of drugs for pain relief. He pioneered the development and use of methods to assess pain and drug therapy for patients with cancer and was one of the first to investigate the sites of action, potency, and efficacy of morphine and other analgesics in patients with pain. The methods he and his MSKCC colleagues developed continue to serve as models for evaluating the efficacy of new analgesics and for measuring patients' differing sensitivity and tolerance to these drugs. His many awards include the 1992 Bristol-Myers Squibb Award for Distinguished Achievement in Pain Research. We extend our condolences to his family. Robert E. Wittes Physician-in-Chief Lisa M.
