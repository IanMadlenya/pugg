        WEINBAUM -- David. We mourn the passing of an extraordinary man, a true gentleman. There was no more devoted husband, father, grandfather, great - grand father and brother. A noted antique importer for over 50 years, he was a decorated veteran of WWII. He will always be remembered for his kindness, generosity and his devotion to his family. His spirit will remain in our hearts forever. His family deeply grieves his loss. Beloved husband of Tobie, devoted father of Eileen and Barry, cherished grandfather of Meredith, Matthew, Benjamin, Steven and Alex, and greatgrandfather of Evan and Kate, loving brother of Marvin. Services Friday 9AM at ''The Riverside,'' 76th St. and Amsterdam Ave.
