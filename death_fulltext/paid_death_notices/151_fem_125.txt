        RUBENSTEIN-Natalie (nee Katz). We mourn the loss of our mother who died August 11 in Far Rockaway, NY. She was 77. Supervising science reference librarian, she helped build and lead the Science and Business Division of Mid-Manhattan Public Library where she served for over 21 years before retirement in 1992. Her family and community life was devoted to mitzvot. She was a lifelong member of Hadassah and an independent and original thinker who inspired the feminism of her children. She will be deeply missed by her children Asa and Fortune Rubenstein of Brooklyn, NY, Diane Rubenstein and Philip Protter of West Lafayette, IN, and Susan Rubenstein and Carl Sabath of Gaithersburg, MD. She greatly enjoyed her granddaughter Rachel Protter. She had the gift for friendship and the art of listening and will be profoundly missed by her friends and colleagues. Donations may be made to Memorial SloanKettering Library Fund, the Gilbert M. Rubenstein Memorial Fund, English Department, Pace University and Haddassah.
