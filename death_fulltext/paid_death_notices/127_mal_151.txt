        AL-JUNDI-Akil. The staff, including 1199 and the Association of Legal Aid Attorneys, the management and the Board of Directors of the Legal Aid Society mourn the death of Akil Al-Jundi, who devoted the last 20 years of his life to assisting persons caught up in the criminal justice system and was an inmate survivor of the Attica rebellion. He died Wednesday night in New York Downtown Hospital at the age of 56 after a complicated illness. Akil worked as a foresnic services assistant in the Criminial Defense Division, where he assisted clients who had been charged with crimes and recomended alternatives to incarceration. In 1992, Akil received the Society's Marden Award for outstanding service and dedication to clients. His work has been recognized by the Correctional Association of New York and the Osborne Association. Akil, who carried the scars of Attica, was one of the inmates in the Attica prison riots in 1971 and the named plaintiff in the civil liability lawsuit that followed. In 1976, he was parolled after serving fifteen years and emerged from prison as a Muslim. He went to work for the Society and earned a reputation for relentless advocacy. Akil was the senior delegate for 1199 and a strong advocate for his co-workers. Funeral services will be held at 4 PM, Friday, at the Masjid Malcolm Shabazz, 102 West 116 Street, N.Y. Public viewing will be held from 1-3 PM, Friday at Marcus Jackson Funeral Home, 2461 8th Avenue, N.Y. We express our profound sympathies to his wife Evelyn, son Ronald, two daughters Wanda and Monique, two granddaughters Niasia and Daria and three grandsons Brandon, Austin and Ronald.
