        ROSENBERG-Helen N. October 25, 2002. Helen Rosenberg knew how to live. For 86 years, friends marveled at her energy, intelligence and fiery spirit...and of course, her style. Born Helen Natalie Goldstein, she graduated from Brooklyn College in 1936 and worked as a legal secretary with Rubin, Baum & Levin. Independent and fearless, Helen lived in Greenwich Village, but traveled solo throughout the world. At home, she sought out new challenges, studying language at L'Ecole Francaise and taking writing and film classes. She volunteered with Americans for Democratic Action, and was for more than 20 years an active, beloved member of the Duke Ellington Society, serving as both a board member and treasurer. Sharply observant, Helen had plenty of opinions and loved to share them. Her stories, letters and poems appeared in many New York publications, including The Times. Her last, perhaps prophetic, contribution to Metropolitan Diary ran on June 4, 2001 under the title, ''Prayer.'' It read: ''When I start out on that last trip to meet my maker,/Let me not hear those fateful words, 'Change at Jamaica.''' Helen, we're sure you caught the express.
