        VELEZ--Alvaro. June 8, 1944 June 14, 2004. It is with great sadness that Swanke Hayden Connell announces the passing of Alvaro Velez. He worked with the firm from 1971 to 2002, achieving the position of Associate Principal. The major portion of his career was spent in New York, where he contributed substantially to the growth and design excellence in Interior Design. In 1989 he moved to Miami where he became a celebrated leader of Interior Design in South Florida. For all who knew him, he was the definition of spirituality and joy. His family will miss him very much. He is survived by three sisters and two brothers who loved him very much.
