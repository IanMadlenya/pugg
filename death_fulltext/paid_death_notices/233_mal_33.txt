        $(6$)CANTOR--Sol. How does one accept the loss of a friend of 70 years? The days spent on the golf course as a twosome followed by lunch and bridge. He was brilliant, an avid reader and thoroughly knowledgeable in current events. Every minute spent with him was a pleasure. We will miss him. Pat & Harry Markowitz
