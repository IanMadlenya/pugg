        CHAPIN-Harold. With profound sorrow the Rabbis and Cantor, Officers, Trustees and members of Congregation Emanu-El express to our colleague and friend, Rabbi Richard S. Chapin, deepest sympathies on the occasion of the death of his beloved father, Harold. A man of impeccable integrity who lived his life with unshakeable values, Harold Chapin has left a legacy to be cherished and revered. The hearts of those whose lives he touched will hold precious his rememberance forever. To Richard, his mother, sisters and all the other members of the family, we reach forth with affectionate care and loving concern. May they be comforted among the mourners of our people, knowing that the memory of Harold Chapin will endure as a beautiful blessing. Rabbi Ronald B. Sobel Rabbi David M. Posner Rabbi Amy B.
