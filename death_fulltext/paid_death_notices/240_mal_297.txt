        MELLONI--Vincent R. We mourn the death of a beloved friend and law office associate who brought joy to work. He was a most astute and knowledgeable attorney, always friendly, dignified and above all, optimistic. To his dear wife Dot, his children and grandchildren, we share your loss. Our wonderful friend and your loved one was a shining star in the galaxy of life. Natalie and Alvin Mitchel and family
