        POST-Sheldon. September 5, 1936June 25, 1988. Founder Chelsea Pines Inn. Chairman NYC Gay Men's Chorus. Board, Congregation Beth Simchat Torah. As we begin Gay Pride weekend it is important to remember those in the gay community who were lost in the still raging AIDS war. Sheldon was an out and proud gay man who dreamed of a better world and fought to make his dream come true. He was a beloved companion, son, brother, uncle, friend. Please join Tom Klebba and me in a moment of reflection this weekend as we recall those who have gone too soon: Mark Fuschetti, Peter Monette, Gary Olde, Jon Flaherty, Gary Brubach, Benn Brown and Wayne Kell, Tom Bradley, Garon Douglas, Jay ''Peggy Sue'' Farrar, Dean X Johnson, Allan Kendric and Ron McSwiggen, Bob Levine, Eddie Peters, Quinton Johnson, Norman Sweet, Eddie Tilchen. ''Not a day goes by, not a blessed day...'' Sheldon, my love, know that you will always be missed and cherished. All will be remembered and celebrated as long as we live. Jay Lesiger
