        GUTERMAN -- Abraham S. The Board of Trustees of the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law and the entire Cardozo community is deeply saddened by the death of one of its founding members. Abraham Guterman served on the Cardozo Board from the founding of the Law School in 1976 through 2000, when he continued as an honorary member of the Board. From the beginning, he was a visionary for and active supporter of the Law School. Each of us has dreams for what he can do for the good and advancement of others, but not all of us can make these dreams a reality. Mr. Guterman's ability to effect change, to influence generations of students in their development and learning, and to inspire in others the desire to do the same was his special gift; one that is deeply appreciated and celebrated by the Cardozo community. He will be sorely missed. We send our condolences to the entire Guterman family. Earle I. Mack, Chairman, Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law David Rudenstine, Dean
