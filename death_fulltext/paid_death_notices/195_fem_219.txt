        RYCHTARIK-Gertrud. With sadness we report the passing of our dearly beloved mother, mother-in-law, and grandmother on April 28 in her 91st year. But we celebrate a life filled with goodness and compassion, with love and understanding, with vitality and joy of life, and with deep and long-lasting friendships. A life made richer through her wide-ranging interests in and knowledge of all things cultural, as well as her sense of business and of social graces. She was active in several philanthropic endeavors, and music organizations and also libraries benefited from her generosity. Her husband, Richard Rychtarik, artist, stage designer and architect, passed away in 1982. She is survived by her daughter Ann, her son-in-law John Trayna, and her grandson Andrew of Wayne, New Jersey, and a sister Lotte Reyersbach and a nephew and niece, Drs. Peter and Jane Reyers of Tucson, Arizona. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the American Cancer Society, 1800-227-2345
        RYCHTARIK-Gertrud S. We mourn the loss of Trude Rychtarik, a special client and a unique woman. Her grace and elegance touched and enriched the lives of many. We extend our deepest sympathies to Ann, John and Andrew. Rose & Kissin, LLP
