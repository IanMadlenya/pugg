Bob graduated from Brooklyn Law School in 1953 and served in the Air Force Judge Advocates Office during the Korean War. He was a developer and manager of real estate in his working years, but his passion was the ocean. Bob spent the last 25 years of his life sailing, fishing and living on the water.
