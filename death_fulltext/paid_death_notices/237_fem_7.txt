        ROBINTON--Madeline Russell on September 13 2006, at the age of 97. Wife of the late Hermann Robinton. Beloved Aunt of Anne Russell Sullivan, great-aunt of Kyle and Sean Sullivan. Professor Emeritus of History, Brooklyn College, from its formative period in 1931 to her retirement in 1976. Graduate of Hunter High School and an Honors and Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Barnard College in 1929, she won an international fellowship after receiving her Bachelor's degree that permitted study in England and Germany. Professor Robinton earned M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Columbia University in 1931 and 1944. She served as Trustee of Barnard College and a Fellow of the British Royal Society of the Arts, volunteer for Phi Beta Kappa and a History Book Review Editor for its Key Reporter. Professor Robinton was a gifted and inspirational teacher. Her many students kept in touch with her through the years, dedicating publications and awards to her and always commenting that her guidance had a profound effect on their scholarly endeavors and their perspective on life and the world around them. Graceful and articulate until the end, Professor Madeline Robinton will be sorely missed by her family and friends.
