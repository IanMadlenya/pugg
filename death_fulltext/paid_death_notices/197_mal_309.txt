        WASHINGTON--Rev. Dr. Preston R. Sr. Congregation Rodeph Sholom mourns the passing of our friend and brother, Rev. Dr. Preston R. Washington Sr., Senior Pastor of Memorial Baptist Church. Rev. Washington inspired our congregation as well as his own with his brillance, passion and faith. Our congregations built a unique relationship which now becomes a part of his remarkable legacy. We will sorely miss him. Our condolences go to his wonderful wife, Executive Pastor Rev. Renee F. Washington, their entire family, and the Memorial Baptist family. May God bless you all. Robert N.
