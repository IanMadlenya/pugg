        DREWES-William. Died at the age of 72, after a brief illness. Bill, a graduate of Columbia College and Cambridge University, went on to an illustrious career as a management consultant, lecturing and publishing two books on the subject. His true passion, however, was in pursuing the mystery of Catholicism. He wrote the children's book, ''Discovering God.'' He loved and was loved by his wife, Jean, two children, Bill and Margaret, seven grandchildren, and his devoted cousin Frederick. He was a distinctive individual with a sharp intelligence, and an idosyncratic manner, a great sense of humor and a huge capacity for the enjoyment of life. The wake will be Thursday and Friday at Doyle B. Shaffer, Little Neck, NY. In lieu of flowers donations may be made to your charity of choice.
