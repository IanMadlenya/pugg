        DeLOCA--Cornelius E. The Executive Committee, Foundation Board and staff of the Metropolitan Golf Association mourn the passing of their former President and Chairman on December 1st. Connie DeLoca was more than a dedicated volunteer, he was a friend and leader. His many contributions to the MGA, and in particular to junior golf, will have a lasting impact on the game he loved. We offer our deepest sympathies to his wife Ann, children, grandchildren and to the entire DeLoca family. Donald J. Hendler, President Jay Mottola, Exec. Dir.
