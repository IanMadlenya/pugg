        BENEDICT -- Jane. Board Members, staff and volunteers of the Metropolitan Council on Housing were deeply saddened by the death of founder and longtime chair Jane Benedict on Saturday, June 18, 2005, at the age of 93. Jane was unflagging in the fight for tenants' rights and a passionate and persistent advocate for ecomonic and social justice across the board. At Met Council, she was not only an inspirational leader but also our energy, our teacher, our mentor, and our dear friend. Our love for her and her late husband, Peter Hawley, is matched by the dedication to activism and justice she instilled in all of us.
