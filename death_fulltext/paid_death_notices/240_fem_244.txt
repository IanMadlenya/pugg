        FIORATO--Joelyn. Peter Martins and the New York City Ballet mourn the passing of Joelyn Fiorato, beloved wife of our long-time Music Director and current Conductor Emeritus, Hugo Fiorato. An author and artist, Joelyn had a larger-than-life spirit that made her a treasured member of the New York City Ballet family. We extend our deepest condolences to Hugo and the family. She will be missed.
