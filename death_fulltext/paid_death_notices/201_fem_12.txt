        STARK -- Florence, whose high energy and continued buoyant spirit made her a mother we admired to our cofounder and co-chairperson, Toby Lynn Perlman, and mother-in-law to Toby's husband, Itzhak. As a dedicated grandmother to five and great-grandmother to two, and friend to many, she communicated a musical inspiration and love of life to all of us involved with The Perlman Music Program. With fond memories from the Board, staff, students and faculty of The Perlman Music Program.
