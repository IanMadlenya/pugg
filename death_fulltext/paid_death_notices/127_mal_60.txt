        PRAGER-David A. 1913-1997. David Prager was a past-President, an indispensable Trustee, and a best friend of the Municipal Art Society for over thirty years. Whenever a work of municipal art was endangered, from Grand Central Terminal to the Guggenheim Museum to a faded WPA Mural; whenever excessive bulk and density threatened to cast too long a shadow; David, passionate but always civil, was there. We miss him already. Whatever will we do without him? Municipal Art Society of New York
