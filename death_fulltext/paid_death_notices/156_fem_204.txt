        PARKER-Doris. The faculty, staff and candidates of the Columbia University Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research mourn the passing of our beloved former librarian, Doris Parker. For 25 years, Doris nurtured and raised our candidates and faculty. She will be sorely missed. Robert A. Glick, M.D. Director
