Dr. Rall headed the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and served as U.S. Assistant Surgeon General for nineteen years. A longtime Environmental Defense Fund Board member and recognized pioneer of modern environmental medicine, Dr. Rall was a dedicated scientist, and tireless advocate for public health and a clean, safe environment. His life and work will always be an inspiration for medical and environmental professionals. We extend our sincere condolences to his wife, children, grandchildren and brother.
