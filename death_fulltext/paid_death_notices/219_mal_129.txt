        HILLEMAN--Maurice R. The Board of Trustees and Scientific Advisory Council of the Albert B. Sabin Vaccine Institute note with great sorrow the loss of Dr. Maurice R. Hilleman, on April 11, 2005. A true giant among scientists, Dr. Hilleman is credited with developing more vaccines than any other individual in history, including eight of the ten routinely recommended vaccines. His selfless dedication to eradicating disease saved countless millions of lives and prevented suffering among millions more. His intellect, integrity, and unwavering commitment to serve society inspired two generations of scientific researchers worldwide. Dr. Hilleman, recipient of the 1997 Albert B. Sabin Gold Medal, leaves behind many friends and colleagues whose lives were enriched for having known and worked with him. His vision and his friendship will be deeply missed. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Lorraine, his children, Jeryl Lynn and Kirsten, his brothers, Victor and Norman, and his five grandchildren. H.R. Shepherd, DSc, Chairman William R. Berkley, Co-Chair Sabin Vaccine Institute Board of Trustees Dean D. Mason, Pres. & CEO Peter J. Hotez, M.D., Ph.D., Chair, Sabin Vaccine Institute Scientific Advisory Council
