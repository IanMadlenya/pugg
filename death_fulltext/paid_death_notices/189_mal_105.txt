        ANNENBERG-Walter H. The Trustees and staff of the British Museum, the Chairman and staff of the British Museum Development Trust and the Directors and staff of the American Friends of the British Museum, record with great sadness the death of Walter H. Annenberg. He was a great man and a much valued friend of Britain who left an indelible mark on British life, not least in the arts and education. Together with his wife Leonore he did so much to enhance the cultural scene in Britain, both during his Ambassadorship to the United Kingdom and indeed ever since. Mrs. Annenberg is President of the American Friends of The British Museum and a source of constant inspiration. Mr. Annenberg's generosity was of a unique scale, discriminating and matched by the passion with which he gave and the pleasure he derived from seeing the impact of his support. The professionalism he brought to his philanthropy was well known, as was the charm and sense of humour he was imbued with. The generosity of the Annenberg Foundation towards the British Museum has been of seminal importance, per manently recognised in the Walter and Leonore Annenberg Information Centre. This is located in the Museum's Round Reading Room, and epitomises the visionary support that characterised Walter Annenberg's philanthropy, and was most notably opened by HM The Queen. We send our heartfelt sympathy to Mrs. Annenberg and the Annenberg family. Sir John Boyd, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the British Museum Neil MacGregor, Director Lord Moser, Chairman British Museum Development Trust Judith Ogden Thomson Chairman of the American Friends of the British Museum
