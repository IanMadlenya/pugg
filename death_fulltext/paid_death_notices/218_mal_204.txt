        LESTER--William M. BenGurion University of the Negev and American Associates, Ben-Gurion University deeply mourn the passing of our dear friend and long time supporter William M. Lester. A mechanical engineer, William Lester revolutionized the plastics industry 70 years ago with his design of an automatic molding machine. He was an active philanthropist and founder of AABGU. We extend our deepest sympathies to his beloved wife Gloria, his children Kenneth and Gay, and to his entire family. May his memory be a blessing. Lis Gaines, President Vivien K. Marion, Exec VP
