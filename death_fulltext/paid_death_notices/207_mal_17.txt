        HAMILTON--George Heard. The trustees and staff of the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute note with sorrow the passing of George Heard Hamilton, director of the Clark from 1966-1977. As one of the foremost historians, critics and scholars of the twentieth century, he left an indelible impact on the Clark and the museum world. He established the research and academic foundation for the Clark through the founding of the Clark's art history library and the establishment of the Williams College/Clark Art Institute Graduate Program in the History of Art, which too has become one of the leading programs of its kind in the United States. Professor Hamilton also initiated the Clark's full scale exhibition program in 1976; and oversaw an important building addition in 1973. His noteworthy acquisitions include Monet's ''Rouen Cathedral.'' We are grateful for the strong foundation George built for us, and extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Polly, and their family. Michael Conforti, Director Francis Oakley, President Board of Trustees, Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, Williamstown
