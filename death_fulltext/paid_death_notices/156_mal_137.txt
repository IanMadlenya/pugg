        YARMOLINSKY-Adam. For 33 years, Adam Yarmolinsky was a deeply engaged and supportive trustee of the Vera Institute of Justice. His wide experience, interesting and analytic mind, and commitment to those often neglected by society, both here and abroad, strengthened our work immeasurably. A thick file of correspondence-questions, comments, offers to help-testifies to his involvement. We will miss him. Frederick A.O. Schwarz, Jr., Chair Christopher Stone, President
