        GOLDSTEIN-Leon M. CUNY has lost one of its most imaginative and productive sons. His work has had a transforming effect on Kingsborough Community College and beyond. On a personal basis, I've lost a special friend. Maggi and I convey our heartfelt condolences to Mary, Lisa and Michael and other members of his family. Matthew Goldstein
