        McSWEENEY-Edward F. III (Dooley). Seven years have rolled by and somehow you seem to continue to touch the lives of the legion of friends you left behind. Ryan has learned the ''business of the business'' while Goldstein has become a Joycean Scholar of his usual evangelical intensity. Berg and Gardner found themselves spending the first hour of a recent dinner on ''Dooley Stories.'' Some of us are catching the scent of something called ''roses'' .... which causes you to be missed all the more. Thanks for the memories babycakes. See ya! Your pal, JPK.
