        DENMAN-M. Dolores. The Pattern Jury Instructions Committee of the Association of Supreme Court Justices of the State of New York expresses its grief at the passing of its member, the Presiding Justice of the Appellate Division, Fourth Department on January 17, 2000. The loss to her loving family, the state, the judicial system and our committee is profound, but Justice Denman has created for us imperishable memories of a great public servant and a uniquely remarkable human being. Leon D. Lazer, Chair of PJI
