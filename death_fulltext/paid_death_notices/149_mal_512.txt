        BLOOM-Samual M., M.D. The Mount Sinai Alumni express profound sorrow at the loss of our esteemed colleague and friend. Dr. Bloom joined the staff in 1935 and for over 50 years distinguished himself as teacher and clinician in his chosen field of otolaryngology. Devoted to his patients whom he cared for with expertise and compassion and a conscientious mentor who touched the lives of countless students and residents, he was respected by his peers and loved by his patients. During W.W. II, while serving in the phillippines with the U.S. Medical Corps, Dr. Bloom was captured and held in several military prison camps. Handicapped by a completely inadequate medicinal supply and starvation rations, he worked tirelessly and faithfully to curtail the physical and mental deterioration among fellow prisoners. For the heroism which he demonstrated, his dauntless spirit, untiring devotion to duty and unwavering courage, Major Bloom was awarded a Bronze Star Medal. Our deepest condolences are extended to his family. Avi Barbasch, M.D., President Jeffrey S. Freed, M.D. Vice Pres. Maria Padilla, M.D., Secretary William G. Stein, Treasurer
