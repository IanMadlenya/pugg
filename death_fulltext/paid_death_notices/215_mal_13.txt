        SCHLEIEN--Howard. It is with great sadness that the family and friends of Howard Schleien mark his passing on November 30th. His laughter and smile will be missed by all of us forever. He was the husband of the previously deceased Carol, the father of his beloved daughters Susie and Jackie and welcomed Michael and Steven as his sons when they married his daughters. He loved his grandchildren Tara, Jake, Brandon and Austin. He loved music and Broadway, golf and children. To know him was to be his friend. He brought laughter and joy to every situation and lived a full, happy life. He will live on in the hearts of his family and friends.
