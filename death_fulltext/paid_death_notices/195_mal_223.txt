        EHRLICH - Cantor Moshe. Congregation Beth Sholom is profoundly saddened with the sudden passing in Israel of our revered and beloved Chazzan and teacher Moshe Ehrlich, who had served us for almost 50 years. He devoted his life to his family, his community and the people of Israel. May the memory of his sweet voice continue to inspire us and give comfort to his beloved wife Reva and the family.
