        LABALME-Patricia Hochschild. The Trustees and staff of the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation fondly remember our colleague and friend Patsy Labalme. Patsy was our senior trustee who, in many important ways, shaped the work and goals of the foundation. Her intelligence, character, good judgement, and grace set the tone for our deliberations. The way she lived and her achievements are the best arguments imaginable for the salutary effects of placing the humanities at the center of one's life. We join her many friends among the community of scholars in extending our condolences to her husband George and their family. We will do our best to continue her work at the foundation, and to measure up to the high standards she set for us all, but most of all, for herself.
