        ALLISON-Karen Hubert. On December 16, 1997, 49 yrs old, of breast cancer. It is with great sadness that we mark the loss of our dear friend, Karen, poet, writer, teacher, artist, chef, and loving mother. For thirty years and more, she has so generously shared herself with us and so many others. A wonderful, funny storyteller who fought for life until the very last moment. We will miss her most profoundly. Our hearts are with her family, Len, Halley, Luke, Matthew, & Wendy. Carol and Peter Marsh Joan Banach and Wayne Lavender
