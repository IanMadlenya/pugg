        TROTTA - Geraldine. Geri died at her New York City home recently. The Barnard graduate, author and editor packed her 90 years full of adventure, travel and food. She shared them with the world in many publications. An editor of Harper's Bazaar and longtime Gourmet Magazine correspondent, she was a million mile traveler and authored three novels. Geri Trotta was full of zest and opinions to the end. She wanted no fuss made when she arrived there, but this unique woman's passing could not go unremarked by those who respected and loved her.
