        CARRUTHERS - Tony, artist, teacher, bon vivant. On October 19, 1999. Much loved by friends, colleagues, collaborators and extended family, Tony is survived by his cat Wenckebach and countless absurd and inspirational moments. He taught and worked in the USA, England and Europe; most recently at Bennington College in Vermont, where he was in midst of a multimedia course on the social physicalization of death. A memento mori with photos, drawings and videotapes will be open on Friday evening November 12 thru Sunday, November 14th at 537 Broadway in Manhattan, and a celebration of his life and work will be held in Bennington, Vermont on December 11th, 1999. More information on these events is available at (212) 539-3537. His own bio is perhaps his best epitaph-Tony Carruthers: Once worked in a brewery. He makes video; designs performances and watches TV, but he also watches the light outside his windows.
