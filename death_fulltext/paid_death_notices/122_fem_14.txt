        JOACHIM-Florence B. The staff of Printing News/East announce with deep sorrow the death of our beloved Editor and Publisher on February 28, 1997 at the age of 84. A native of San Luis Obispo, CA, Florence was the loving wife of the late Leo H. Joachim, who in 1929 founded Printing News, the weekly publication she served continuously from 1948 until failing health forced her retirement earlier this year. During that time she acted as production manager, editor, associate publisher, sales director, and publisher. She also collaborated with Leo on the Production Yearbook and other special publications for the graphic arts. After her husband's death in 1985, Mrs. Joachim guided Printing News through several changes of ownership to its present successful association with PTN Publishing Co's Graphic Arts Network. A legend among printers in the NYC Metro area for her tireless efforts to promote their interests in the pages of Printing News, she is remembered with special affection as the author of Pi a la Mode, a weekly column on the doings of the paper's many close friends throughout the industry. She held nearly all of the printing community's highest honors including induction into the New York Printers Wall of Fame, the Luminaire Award from Women in Production, and the Navigators Service To Industry Award. Florence was educated at the University of Southern California where she earned membership in Phi Beta Kappa for her studies in Greek. In keeping with Florence's wishes cremation took place privately. Further information will be published in Printing News/East.
        JOACHIM-Florence. Our dearly beloved mother, goodbye from Laurance, Robin, Marco and Barbara Joachim. We will miss you.
