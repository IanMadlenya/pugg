        HOBERMAN -- Henry, D., M.D., Ph.D. Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University records with profound sorrow the passing of our distinguished professor emeritus of biochemistry. A member of our founding faculty, in 1953, Dr. Hoberman, was instrumental in helping the College attain its status early on as one of the leading medical schools in the country. An outstanding scientist with particular expertise in kinetics and physical biochemistry, he was also a dedicated physician who for more than two decades cared for patients at our affiliated hospital, Jacobi Medical Center. His warmth and optimism touched all who knew him. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Hilda, his children John, David, Ruth and Michael and his five grandchildren. Dominick P. Purpura, M.D. The Marilyn and Stanley M. Katz Dean Albert Einstein College of Medicine
