        FOLDES-Francis F., M.D. The President and the Board of Trustees of Montefiore Medical Center and the entire Montefiore community are profoundly saddened by the death of Francis F. Foldes, M.D., 86, Chairman Emeritus of Montefiore's Department of Anesthesiology. Dr. Foldes, Montefiore's first Chairman of Anesthesiology, was a dedicated physician and scientist, and a respected mentor to generations of students. His research, including pioneering work in muscle relaxants, had an enormous impact on the practice of anesthesiology and surgery. Dr. Foldes was awarded many honors, including the Distinguished Service Award and the Award for Excellence from the American Society of Anesthesiology. He was the first American to serve as President of the World Federation of Societies of Anesthesiologists and was Chairman of the Medical Advisory Board of the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation. Born and educated in Budapest, Dr. Foldes and his wife, Edith, emigrated to the United States in 1941. He authored numerous clinical articles and coauthored four books. In 1997, the Medical Center established the Francis F. Foldes, M.D., Chair of Anesthesiology in his honor. Our deepest condolences are extended to his wife, Edith; his children, Eva Travers, Barbara Wolkowitz and Judy Dickson; his grandchildren and entire family. Spencer Foreman, MD, President Jay B. Langner, Chairman Board of Trustees Montefiore Medical Center
