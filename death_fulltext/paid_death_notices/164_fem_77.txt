        SCHONBERGER-Lois. The partners and personnel of Fawn Associates and its affiliated companies mourn the passing of Lois Schonberger, beloved wife of our partner and friend, Eli Schonberger. Lois's steadfast refusal to concede defeat to medical probability was an inspiration to all who knew her. May her indomitable spirit live on in Eli and her children and grandchildren.
