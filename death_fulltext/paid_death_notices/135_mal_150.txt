The President, Chancellor, Boards of Governors & Overseers, faculty, administration and students of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion record with profound sorrow the death of Rabbi Samuel Cook, the beloved father of Prof. Michael Cook, a member of our Cincinnati faculty. As a devoted rabbi and educator, Rabbi Cook was the National Director of the National Federation of Temple Youth of the UAHC. His gifts of leadership and spirit made his pioneering work among our youth a singular success. During World War II he served as an Army Chaplain and administered to the needs of our men and women overseas. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his dear wife, Ray Clara, and their sons and grandchildren, whose loss we share. May the family be comforted among all those who mourn for Zion and Jerusalem.
