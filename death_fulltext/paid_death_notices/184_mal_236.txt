        YOUNG-Jeremy S., 39, on May 11, 2002. Too young, too soon. Loving son, brother, nephew, cousin, friend and co-worker at Sungard Data Systems and Financial Technologies International. Jeremy lived life to the fullest, combining tennis with writing poetry; squash with using computers and the Internet; table tennis with stock trading and travel with listening to contemporary music. He was graduated from Cornell in 1985. Jeremy will be deeply missed.
