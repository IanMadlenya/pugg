        GOLDSCHMITT-Otto. On September 14, 1999 at his home in Manhattan in his 90th year. He was the loving husband of Susan for 54 years and the father of Paulette (Reda) and Marv. Born on December 9, 1909 in Ebersheim, Germany, he survived the tortures of Auschwitz with a zeal for life that brought him to America to establish a new home and family. It is with great love that we honor his memory, and give thanks for his honest, dignified and tireless efforts to provide his family to live a life that begged the horrors of his own. He will be missed and will always be remembered. A Memorial Service will be held at The Woolworth Chapel at Woodlawn Cemetery, at 1 P.M. on September 16th. Donations can be made in his memory to DOROT, 171 West 85th Street, New York.
