Cutting-edge painter and graphic designer, adventuresome motorcyclist, accomplished violinist, voracious reader, animal lover, who for two years valiantly fought a rare stomach cancer, succumbed to its ravages peacefully at home surrounded by her beloved mother, sister, brother-in-law, boyfriend, and dog. She will be remembered, loved, and missed for her many talents, beauty, courage, style, wit and humanity. ''E un fior che nasce e muore...ah, tutto, tutto fini.''
