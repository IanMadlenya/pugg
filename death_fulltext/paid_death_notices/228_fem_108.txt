        CHERNOW--Valerie. January 12, 2006. My wife was a woman of rare beauty, elegance, and grace, a warm and radiant presence in many lives. Although supremly accomplished--she was an expert linguist, a gifted sculptor, a fine teacher at New York City Technical College, a mentor in volunteer programs--she excelled in matters of the heart. She had an infinite capacity for love, an empathy that embraced everyone she met, an unmatched purity and sweetness. She was simply incapable of malice, cruelty, or guile. I bid you adieu, best of wives and best of women. Ron Chernow
