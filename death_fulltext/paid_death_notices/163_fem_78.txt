        LOCKWOOD - Henrietta Ellery Sedgwick. Her commitment to The Horticultural Society of New York in general and her support of our library in particular, spanned many decades. To say that Netta will be missed falls too far short of what we feel institutionally and personally. She was imbedded in the warp and the woof of The Society, and like a strong silk thread in a tapestry, she will be always be there, always remembered, always an integral part of what holds The Society together, keeps it grounded in its history and therefore able to move forward.
