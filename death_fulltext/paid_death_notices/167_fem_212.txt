        UCHIMA-Toshiko, age 82, on December 18. Beloved wife of the late Ansei, loving mother of Anju and wife Yoko, proud and adoring grandmother of Maya and Lenn, and dear sister of Teruyuki Aohara and Sachiko Ashihara. The widely esteemed artist of many exquisitely crafted box assemblages exhibited in New York and in Japan over many years, evoking cherished times, places and people, real and imagined, steeped in romance, fancy, love and wit. She was admired for her grace, sincerity and unwavering appreciation of life's beauty and wonder and for her uncommon resolve, courage and dedication. She will be especially missed for her great warmth and devotion to the many whom she held dear.
