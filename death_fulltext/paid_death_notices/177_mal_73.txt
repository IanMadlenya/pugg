        LAPORTE-William. The faculty, staff, students and alumni of Columbia University's Health Sciences Division mourn the passing of our good friend William Laporte, an esteemed trustee of Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. Over many years of service to both the hospital and the University, Mr. Laporte was generous with his time, expertise and spirit-resulting in important advances and new directions in research, clinical care, education, and community service. We offer our deepest condolences to his children, Suzanne, Lynn and William, and to his nine grandchildren. Gerald D. Fischbach, M.D. Executive Vice President for Health and Biomedical Sciences, Columbia University Health Sciences
