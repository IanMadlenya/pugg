        WEIDENBACHER--Richard L. Jr., M.D., aged 76, a psychiatrist on the Forensic Psychiatry Service at Kings County Hospital since 1973, died suddenly on May 10, 2006. He was a graduate of Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania Medical School. Dick, who was well known for his sharp intellect, elegant writing, and compassion for his patients, was involved in psychiatric evaluations for the courts for some of the area's highest profile criminal cases. He placed a premium on objectivity, loved to teach colleagues and students. Driven by his love of medicine he did residencies in pathology and surgery. He also studied Arabic, Japanese, Greek, comparative religions, and anthropology. After completing his residency in general psychiatry at Kings County Hospital in 1968, he joined the U. S. Navy Medical Corps as a psychiatrist attached to the First Marine Division in Da Nang. Upon his return he did a residency in child psychiatry at Columbia Presbyterian. Survivors include his sister, Lee Winborne and many nieces and nephews to whom he was very devoted. The family suggests donations in his memory to St. Andrew's Presbyterian College, 1700 Dogwood Mile, Laurinburg, NC 28352. A memorial gathering will take place at Kings County Hospital on June 28, 2006, 3 PM, at Kings County Hospital, G Building.
