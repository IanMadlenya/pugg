He was employed by CBS, Inc. from about 1983-until 1995, and worked as a Media/Broadcasting/Cable analyst for the past nine years at Merrill Lynch. Keith, a loyal and loving husband to his wife Sally, was an inspiration to all of us with his love and compassion for his extraordinary child, Sam and a proud father of his two wonderful daughters, Elizabeth and Rebecca. To Keith, his children were his life's greatest achievements. He is also survived by his aunt, Mary Ann Patterson, sister, Chris Janssen, brotherin-law Joe Janssen, two nephews, Peter and Ethan Janssen. His mother-in-law, Elizabeth Ness, misses him dearly.
