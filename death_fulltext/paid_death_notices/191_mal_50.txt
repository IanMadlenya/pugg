        CASTIGLIONI-Achille. The Museum of Modern Art notes with sadness the death of design master Achille Castiglioni. Mr. Castiglioni's ties to the Modern reach far back in time beginning with the acquisition of several of his early works and culminating with a 1997 retrospective. A pillar of the history of design, he leaves behind a legacy of creativity, ingenuity, wit, and hundreds of unforgettable objects. He is especially remembered for the sell out performance he gave in 1997 in conjunction with his exhibition. He was loved, admired, imitated and none the less always humble and understated. Achille Castiglioni will live on in the way we all appreciate design. The Department of Architecture & Design The Museum of Modern Art
