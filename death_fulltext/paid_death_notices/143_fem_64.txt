        WOODS-Gertrude B. The family of Gaby Woods grieves for the loss of this devoted wife, mother and grandmother. Her many friends remember her honesty and zest for living. Gaby showed special courage in her final year, when she gallantly withstood cancer until finally succumbing on December 4, at age 71. She was a loving wife to William, devoted mother to Michael, sympathetic mother-in-law to Lois, and delighted grandmother of Tyler and Christopher. We miss her deeply.
