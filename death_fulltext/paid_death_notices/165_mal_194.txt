        ROSANO-Michael. Political activist, respected publicist, and devoted friend. He began his career in public television at Channel 13. He worked for Manhattan Borough President and City Council President Andrew Stein as deputy press secretary and for City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman as a community liaison. He served the gay and lesbian community as political director of the Empire State Pride Agenda and of the Anti-Violence Project, and served all New Yorkers until his passing as Deputy Communications Director to State Senator Martin Connor, Minority Leader of the New York State Senate. A faithful supporter of Congresswoman Bella Abzug throughout her career, a democrat in all senses, Michael was warm, generous, witty, and loving: loyal to his friends, to the causes he believed in, to the public interest he served with selflessness, dignity, humor, and honor. In our sorrow, we remember the strength, courage, and grace with which Michael endured until the end, and we join the Rosano family in grief.
