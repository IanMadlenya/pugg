        ANY--Marcelle. A rare jewel. Marcelle Any, beloved wife of Albert, cherished mother of Alan and Carol, loving grandmother of Lauren, Eileen, and Andy, devoted sister and daughter, died peacefully on Thursday evening, September 7th, 2006. She was 84 years old. Born in Bombay, India, to Iraqi Jewish parents, she came in 1947 to the United States, where she married and settled in NYC. In 1960, she and her family moved to Larchmont, NY. Generous and gentle, consoling and self-effacing, for nearly 60 years she was the emotional mainstay of her family, succoring and soothing them through their troubles with her steady guidance and unwavering encouragement. An accomplished seamstress, knitter, and crocheter, she made whole wardrobes of unique and delightful clothes for her children and grandchildren. Nearly everyone who met her was captivated by her beauty and gentle kindness. The Book of Proverbs asks, ''Who can find a woman of valor?'' Her husband did. She is and will be forever missed.
