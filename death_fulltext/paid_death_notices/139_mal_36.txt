        LEFKOWITZ-Rabbi Leopold (Leibish). The World Council of Orthodox Jewish Communities, has suffered the profound loss of its President and dynamic leader who, as head of the Crystal Clear Industries, shared all of his energies, precious time and hard-earned wealth with his poorer brethren worldwide. We join in the heartfelt sorrow of his devoted wife, daughter, son and grandchildren in mourning his passing, Saturday, Tishah B'Av, and being interred Sunday in Kiryas Joel-Monroe, one of the many projects he had realized. May his bereaved family be consoled among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Eliezer (Louie) Kestenbaum, Chairman Executive Committee Rabbi Hertz Frankel, Vice President Rabbi Chaim M. Stauber, Executive Vice President
