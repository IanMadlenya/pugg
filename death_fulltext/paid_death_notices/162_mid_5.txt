        LITT-Mary S. The Officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York are deeply saddened by the lost of Mary S. Litt, a dear friend of the Jewish community. As president of the Litt Foundation, Mrs. Litt embraced the humanitarian concerns of her late husband, Solomon, a remarkable leader admired for his wisdom and generosity. Their son, Mark, is perpetuating his family's cherished philanthropic traditions through his exceptional leadership and support. We extend our sincerest condolences to Mark; to Mrs. Litt's daughter, Susan McLeod; her grandchildren, Lauren, Steven, Cindy, Helen, Tammie, and Phillip; her great-grandchildren; and to the entire family. James S. Tisch, President Larry Zicklin, Board Chair John S. Ruskay, Exec VP & CEO
