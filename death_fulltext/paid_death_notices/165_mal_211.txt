        LEWIS-Stanley A. He died the way he lived-stubbornly refusing to take no for an answer. His last battle was fought with courage, strength, perseverance and dignity. His tenaciousness was also reflected in his business and charitable endeavors. His fierce love for his family will never be forgotten. His absence will leave a profound void. Survived by his wife Judy; his children Jordan, Jonathan and Elizabeth; mother Mae; brother Robert and Phoebe Lewis; and sister Margery and Stuart Frost. Service Monday, 1:15 PM, ''Riverside Memorial Chapel,'' 76th St. and Amsterdam Ave. For those who wish to make a donation in his memory the family would appreciate that it be made to The City of Hope, 1500 East Duarte Road, Duarte, CA 91010, Attention: Stephen J. Forman, M.D., Director of Hematology-BMT.
