        ABORN--Louis. The staff of Tams-Witmark Music Library mourns the loss of our Chairman Emeritus, a scholar and gentleman, whose integrity, generosity and wisdom touched us all. His long life remains an extraordinary example of tireless devotion to serving the art and artists of the musical theatre. Farewell, Mr. Aborn.
