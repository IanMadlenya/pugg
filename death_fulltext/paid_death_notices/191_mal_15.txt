Wharton, MD, a prestigious pediatrician at MassGeneral Hospital For Children and Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Boston, and the son of Irving L. Wharton of Floral Park, NY, an honorary chairman of the North ShoreLong Island Jewish Health System Board of Trustees. In April 2002, Dr. Wharton was the recipient of the first Doug Flutie Jr. Award for his lifelong commitment to children with autism and their families. His sensitivity and love of children were attributes that distinguished him as a person and a pediatrician. In addition to Dr. Wharton's father, a former chairman of Long Island Jewish Medical Center, we extend our sympathies to his wife, Dr. Karen Levine, and three children, Sarah, Katie and Seth. Roy J.
