        STEVENS-Sanford, M.D. The members of the Psychoanalytic Association of New York and the faculty of the NYU Psychoanalytic Institute mourn the passing of their distinguished colleague, Sanford Stevens. A graduate of the Institute, and training analyst for many years at both NYU and Columbia, his skilled teaching, scholarly contributions, and devoted treatment of his patients enriched us all. He will be sorely missed. Leonard Barkin, M.D. President, PANY Arthur Lew, M.D., Secy., PANY Michael Singer, D.O., Director NYU Psychoanalytic Inst.
