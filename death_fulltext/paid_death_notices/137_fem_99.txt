        MOWSHOWITZ-Libby. Z'l. Hillcrest Jewish Center mourns the passing of our beloved Rebbitzen emeritus. She devoted her life and was dedicated to the Jewish world and will be sorely missed. All the arms of the synagogue were touched by her guidance as were all the synagogue members for decades. May her loved ones be comforted amongst the mourns of Zion and Jerusalem. Geoffrey Botnick, Rabbi Martin Resnick, President
