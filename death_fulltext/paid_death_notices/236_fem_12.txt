        LUBIN--Tillie K. We note with sadness the passing of Tillie Lubin. Her warmth, spirit, and generosity were greatly admired by those fortunate to know her and treasured by her devoted family. We send our deepest sympathy to Sara and Axel Schupf, and to her loving circle of grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
