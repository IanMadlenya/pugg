        SHEINKMAN--Jack. The administration and board of Amalgamated Bank mourns the death of Jack Sheinkman, former Chairman of the Bank and President of the Amalgamated Closing and Textile Workers Union (now known as UNITE!). An exceptional fighter for labor in the boardroom and on the ground, Mr. Sheinkman pioneered the area of corporate governance when, in 1992, he founded a set of institutional investment funds, the LongView Funds, to enhance shareholder value through active and involved ownership. He also led the labor union in two historic struggles: the campaign to bring social and economic justice to 4,000 workers at the Farah Manufacturing plants in Texas in 1972, which took 22 months before its successful conclusion; and the struggle to unionize J.P. Stevens textile plants, which took over four years and ended in a contractual agreement in 1980. His passing is a sad loss to banking and labor communities, and our hearts go out to his family and all who loved him. The Administration & Board of Amalgamated Bank and UNITE! Labor Union
