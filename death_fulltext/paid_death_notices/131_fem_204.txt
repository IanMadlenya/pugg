        COOPER-Sylvia Rauch Edelstein, eighty, on December 24th, 1997. Beloved mother of Philip and the late Mary, grandmother of Marcy and Kate, aunt of Jackie, Phyllis, Marty and Ellen. Will be dearly missed by her family and friends. Born in the same year as President Kennedy, 1917, she lived a life that espoused to the fullest a famous Kennedy statement: ''Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.'' As a librarian and teacher for fifty years she gave a great deal to our nation's youth. Many children and adults were positively influenced by her love of learning and her willingness to give of herself. Sylvia lost two husbands and a young daughter, yet she perservered and lived long enough to have two beautiful grandchildren, whom she dearly loved. We who loved her, mourn her passing but celebrate her life of service and sacrifice. Donations may be made to the New York City Public Library.
