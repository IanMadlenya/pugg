        EDELMAN--Isidore S. Our Columbia University Medical Center community mourns the death of Isidore S. Edelman, the Robert Wood Johnson Jr. Professor Emeritus of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics at Columbia University's College of Physicians & Surgeons (P&S). ''Izzy'', as he was universally known, made landmark contributions during his 26 years with us. After spending 26 years at the University of California, San Francisco, he joined P&S in 1978 as chairman of biochemistry. He built the department into one of the premier biochemistry departments in the world. The caliber of people he brought into the department and the areas he designated for scientific focus set standards for decades to come. In 1991, after becoming professor emeritus, he began a new undertaking with the founding of the Columbia Genome Center, which he directed until 2000. A notable scientist whose leadership advanced our academic and scientific enterprise in many ways, he received numerous national and international honors. He studied enzymes that transport crucial molecules into and out of cells. His legacy as a scientist, leader, and adviser will set a high standard for coming generations. We extend our sympathies to his wife and children. Funeral services will be Wednesday, November 24, 10 AM at Riverside Chapel, Amsterdam and 76th St. Gerald D. Fischbach, M.D. Executive Vice President, Columbia University Medical Center Dean, Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons
