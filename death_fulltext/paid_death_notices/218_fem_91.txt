        FLEMING -- Shirley. New York City Opera joins the entire classical music world in mourning the passing of our colleague and very dear friend, Shirley Fleming. As a longtime writer, critic, and the editor of Musical America, she has been a respected member of our community for over 25 years. It is difficult to imagine future seasons without her. Her kindness, her integrity, and her support for our company has been stalwart throughout the years. We will miss her gracious friendship. We extend our deepest sympathies to her family and her many friends around the world. Paul Kellogg General Director
