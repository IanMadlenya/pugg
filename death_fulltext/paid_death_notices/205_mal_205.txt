        STRAUS--Philip A. With deep regret, the Board of Directors and Staff of the Center for Defense Information, note the passing of Philip A. Straus, a mentor and pillar of support for CDI since 1974, when he joined its Board of Advisors. His wisdom and brilliant analysis aided CDI's quest for rational US defense policies. His sponsorship of the Intern Program brought hundreds of young people to work and learn at CDI in Washington, DC. His vision and support inspired CDI to use TV to reach millions of people with information and alternative perspectives and for 14 years, CDI's award-winning ''America's Defense Monitor'' TV series was produced in the Straus Studio. Phil was committed to citizen diplomacy. During the Cold War, his travels to China and North Korea with CDI fostered dialogue between their military leaders and Americans. He leaves us a wonderful legacy and we offer our heartfelt sympathy to his wife Lynn and the entire Straus family for their loss. Board of Advisors and Staff Center for Defense Information
