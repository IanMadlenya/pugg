        MEYERSON--Martin. The Directors of the Marconi Society at Columbia University recall the extraordinary contributions of its former chairman and Board member, as a wise, devoted friend and leader. A pioneer in urban planning and a towering figure in higher education, Martin Meyerson tirelessly devoted his energy and acumen through the Society to extending public understanding of the global communications revolution for the benefit of humanity. With sadness, the Society expresses its deep sympathy to his wife Margy and their family.
