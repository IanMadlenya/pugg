        KELLERMAN -- Sam. One month shy of 30. Killed in Los Angeles. Sam was a cosmic influence on everyone. He was a writer without compare, a professional actor, director, book editor, recording artist, columnist, Yiddishist, humanist, Shakespearean scholar and Yankee fan. He was a person of integrity. His vision was vast, and he had the brightest future. His friends were multitudes. Mostly he was devoted to his family--brothers Max, Harry and Jack, and loving son to mother Linda and father Henry. Survived also by his maternal grandmother Ms. Mildred Turkel. He was a devoted grandson to his late maternal grandfather Irving Turkel and to his late paternal grandparents, his Bubba and Zeida, Esther and Sol Kellerman. Goodbye Sam. We all loved you and we all love you! Services Sunday, October 24th, 11:45AM, ''The Riverside'', 76 St and Amsterdam Ave.
        KELLERMAN -- Sam. Sam, we are so sorry that we're left to wonder what your future would have held. We send our love and comfort to Henry, Linda, Max, Harry and Jack. Debbie and Jorge and family
