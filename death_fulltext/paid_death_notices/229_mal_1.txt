        COLEMAN--Henry S. Austin E. Quigley, Dean of Columbia College, The Columbia College Board of Visitors and The Columbia College Alumni Association mourn the passing of Henry S. Coleman, of The Class of 1946 on January 31, 2006. Harry, as he was known, served in many administrative positions during a career of devoted service to Columbia College from 1948 to 1979, including Director of Admissions, Interim Dean of The College, Dean of Freshmen, and Dean of Students. He also served his classmates as their Class Correspondent for The College Alumni Magazine since 1981. He was a 1996 recipient of The College's John Jay Award for distinguished professional achievement. The Dean, The Boards, and The College community extend their deepest sympathy to Harry's widow, Lila, and their family.
