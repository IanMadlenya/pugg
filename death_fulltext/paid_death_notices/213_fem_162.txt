        WEINTRAUB -- Doris. We mourn the loss of Doris Weintraub, adored wife of Jack, devoted mother of Judy Hodson and Rabbi Peter and Ellen Weintraub, cherished grandmother of Daniel and Michael Fadel, Rachel and Bertie Bregman, Tara and and Justin Brass, David and Sara Weintraub, Joseph and Benjamin Weintraub, great grandmother of Noa, Daniella and Susanna, sister of Mort and Marilyn Perlman.
