        McCARTHY-Michael A. The current and former Partners of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP mourn with great sorrow the passing of our esteemed colleague and friend Michael A. McCarthy. Michael joined SOM in 1964 and, due to his extraordinary talent and discipline, was made a Partner less than ten years later in 1973. We are ever mindful of his tremendous contributions to our firm and to its body of work. His dedication to design and the built environment resulted in such notable projects as Columbia Presbyterian and St. Luke's/Roosevelt Hospitals in Manhattan; the Islamic Cultural Center, also in Manhattan; the former Texaco Inc. headquarters in Harrison, NY; numerous buildings around the world for The Chase Manhattan Bank, including the two - building Operations Center at Metrotech, Brooklyn; and the Joint Banking Center in Kuwait. It is impossible to think of Michael without remembering his love for all the arts - painting, sculpture, opera, music and theaterand his passionate pursuit of knowledge of these disciplines. We will remember him fondly and always. The Partners of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP
