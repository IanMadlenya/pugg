        WAGNER -- Rodney. World Wildlife Fund mourns the loss of our long time board member and dear friend, Rodney Wagner. He has been mentor, colleague and a stalwart and insightful supporter of WWF for almost 20 years. He was a thoughtful, quiet, yet forceful advocate for the environment and promoted creative financial solutions to the world's environmental challenges, including conceiving the innovative debt for nature trades which have been used to raise the priority and lower the cost of conservation in developing countries. His wisdom, kindness & commitment to safeguarding our planet for the benefit of wildlife and humans alike will be deeply missed. William K. Reilly, Chairman Kathryn S. Fuller, President and CEO World Wildlife Fund
        WAGNER--Rodney B. Chairman of the Board of Robert College of Istanbul from 1979-2002 and a Trustee from 1968. His knowledge of and devotion to Turkey were legendary and his counsel sought by many. He led Robert College through decades of change gracefully, generously and with great enjoyment. His contributions will be remembered and celebrated for years to come. The school community and, indeed, many in broader Turkish society deeply mourn his loss and offer sympathies to his family.
