        TAUBIN-Bill. The Art Director's Club of NY mourns the loss of one of the great pioneer art directors of the Creative Revolution and former ADC president. Taubin's oeuvre helped transform the very ethos of advertising in the '60s and '70s. He brought to his ad campaigns at Doyle Dane Bernbach a talent driven by a humanity and warmth unmatched by any creative ad thinker before or since. ''You don't have to be Jewish to love Levy's'' is but one of his delicious concepts. Bill Taubin will remain forever a national treasure, a leading stalwart in our Art Director's Hall of Fame.
