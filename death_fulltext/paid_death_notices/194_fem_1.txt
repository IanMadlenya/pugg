        MYERSON-Margaret. The Normandy mourns the loss on February 26, 2003 of our friend and neighbor, Peg Myerson. From her service on our Board of Directors in the early days of our co-op, to her many years as editor-inchief of The Normandy News, and in countless other ways, Peg contributed enormously to the quality of life in The Normandy. She never let her battle with multiple sclerosis prevent her from enjoying travel, the performing arts and fine dining, and from being an active and interested member of our community. Her sound judgement and ready wit, and deft editorial pen, will be sorely missed. Our hearts go out to her husband Howard, companion of 50 years, and we share in his grief. Normandy Owners Corp David Goldblatt, President
