        OBERMAN--Jerome, Ph.D. The Board of Trustees of Long Beach Medical Center records with profound sorrow, the passing of our esteemed colleague Jerome Oberman. A man of intellect and principle, Jerry faithfully served the Medical Center for 19 years as a member of the Board. As chairman of our Personnel Committee Jerry had a profound appreciation of our employees and could be counted on to represent their interests to the Board. His wisdom, warmth and caring spirit will be sorely missed. We extend our deepest sympathies to his beloved wife Edith, his daughter Ellen and to his entire family. Alfred I. Osterland Chairman, Board of Trustees Bernard Kennedy, President Board of Trustees Douglas L. Melzer Chief Executive Officer
