        MOSS--William J. The Officers and Trustees of The Flagler Museum are saddened by the death of their longtime friend and colleague who, with brilliant mind and clever wit, served the Museum safely for 28 years as Secretary, Treasurer and Trustee. His consummate insight, leadership, friendship and charming sense of humor cannot be replaced. We express our deepest sympathy to Casey, his loving wife of 58 years, his nine children and 18 grandchildren. Bill, we will miss you. The Flagler Museum might well not exist today and be the strong institution that it is were it not for your foresight, dedication, steadfast support and lasting leadership. George Matthews, President Robert Hanke, Vice-Pres. William Matthews, Treasurer Thomas Kenan, Secretary
