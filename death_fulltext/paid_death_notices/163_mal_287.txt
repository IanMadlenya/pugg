        KAYE-Robert Neil. It is with profound regret that the employees of the Kings County District Attorney's Office and I mourn the passing of our friend and dear colleague, Deputy District Attorney Robert Neil Kaye. Robert Kaye was an extraordinary individual and an expert in criminal justice, who served the people of the State of New York for over 30 years. He distinguished himself serving 3 District Attorneys and the former Mayor of the City of New York, Edward I. Koch. Robert Kaye was a person of impeccable integrity and compassionate humanity. We will miss him deeply and we offer our sincere condolences to his beloved daughter Rebecca and his entire family. Charles J. Hynes, Kings County District Attorney
