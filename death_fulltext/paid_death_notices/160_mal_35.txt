        OPPENHEIM - Henry. Yeshiva University and its Sy Syms School of Business mourn the passing of a dear friend, a leader of the Jewish community who, with his late wife, Selma, was an SSSB Fellow. We extend heartfelt condolences to their sons, Steven-a YU Guardian and SSSB Founder who established a scholarship fund in their honor at the Business School-and Richard; grandchildren; and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University David S. Gottesman, Chairman Board of Trustees
