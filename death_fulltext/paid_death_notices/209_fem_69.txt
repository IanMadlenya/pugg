        ABRAMSON--Ruth, M.D. The Department of Medicine faculty of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine mourn the loss of their esteemed colleague, friend and mentor, Dr. Ruth Abramson. Dr. Abramson was a graduate of the NYU Medical School, completed her residency at Maimonides and her renal fellowship at Mount Sinai. For the past 38 years, she has been a role model as a physician scientist for generations of trainees. She was a compassionate physician, a gifted teacher, and a rigorous scientist. In many ways, Ruth Abramson was the soul of our Department and we will miss her greatly.
