        PORTNOY--Samuel, 84, died March 8 in Portland, Oregon, from cancer. Beloved husband of Theo, loving father to Lois and Eli, son-in-law Dean Richards and granddaughter Anna, brother to Martin and the late Minna Ring. Orignally from Queens, he graduated from Union College and NYU School of Dentistry. He had been a resident of Scarsdale and Amagansett, L.I. and practiced in Manhattan and Scarsdale for over 50 years. He resided in Orlando, FL until his illness where he practiced pro bono dentistry for the Coalition for the Homeless. A lover of people, the life of any social gathering with a keen ability to relate to anyone and devoted to his patients, he will be greatly missed by all who knew him.
