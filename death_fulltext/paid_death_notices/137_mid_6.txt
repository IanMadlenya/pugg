        ROSEN-Helen V. Of New York. Died June 12, at the age of 91. Mrs. Rosen assisted her husband, the renowned ear surgeon Dr. Samuel Rosen, during his travels around the world teaching his new surgical procedure to relieve a common form of deafness. Dr. and Mrs. Rosen were honored by many countries, and, in 1971, became among the first Americans invited to visit the People's Republic of China. A lifelong progressive activist, Mrs. Rosen was one of the last and closest friends of the late singer and actor Paul Robeson and was the focus of considerable media attention in connection with this year's 100th anniversary of Mr. Robeson's birth. She was the daughter of Julia and Emmanuel VanDernoot, mother of Dr. John F. Rosen and the late Judith Ruben, grandmother of five and great-grandmother of four. Contributions in her memory can be given to the Ramapo-Anchorage Camp, PO Box 266, Rhinebeck, NY 12572. A memorial service will be announced.
