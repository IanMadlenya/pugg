        DENHOFF--Lee. The Board of Trustees, Associate Board, Parker League, Administration & staff of Parker Jewish Institute for Health Care & Rehabilitation are deeply saddened by the passing of Lee Denhoff, beloved mother of our friend, Trustee and Assistant Secretary of the Board, Mike Denhoff. In her later years, Lee Denhoff faced illness with remarkable courage, grace, faith and independence. Her magnificent spirit will live forever in the minds of all whose lives she touched. An eloquent advocate for the health care of older adults, she will remain a beacon of hope for those who face physical challenges, and a guiding light for those who care for the elderly. It is our hope that fond memories, love of family, and the heartfelt condolences of friends help the Denhoff family during this very difficult time. Jerry Landsberg, Chairman of the Board Michael N. Rosenblut, President/CEO
