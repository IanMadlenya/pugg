        ROSENTHAL-Alexander H., MD. It is with deep sorrow that we note the passing of Alexander H. Rosenthal, M.D., Chairman Emertus of Obstetrics/Gynecology at Long Island Jewish Medical Center. During his tenure from 1954 until 1971, he pioneered teaching activities that included the development of a major residency program and a post-graduate course for area-wide positions. Today the community is richly endowed with physicians in this specialty due, in large measure, to his efforts. Clinician, teacher and scientist, Dr. Rosenthal was among the ''greats'' who chartered LIJ's future direction. We offer our deepest sympathy to his daughter, Jane Rosenthal Carlantonio and granddaughter Jenny. Roy Zuckerberg, Chairman David R. Dantzker, MD, President and CEO
