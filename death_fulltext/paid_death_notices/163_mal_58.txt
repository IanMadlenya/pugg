        LASKY-Burt. It is with deep sadness that we note the passing of Burt Lasky, a cherished friend and co-worker. His devotion to family and affection for friends and colleagues, warmth and dedication to his work, gave strength to those who were associated with him. He accepted his triumphs with humility and defeats with humor. He refused to surrender to despair or diminish his dignity following the loss of his beloved wife. He assisted all who needed him and brought light and happiness to those who sought his counsel. To all who were lucky enough to know him, he was just one nice guy. He will be missed, our condolences to his son Andrew and to the rest of his family. The Officers, Directors and Employees Green Bus Lines, Inc. Triboro Coach Corp. Jamaica Buses, Inc.
