        MAY-Ernest M. of Summit, NJ died on December 6, 2002, age 89. Larger than life in all qualities, he will be greatly missed by his family and many friends at Christ Hospital, Montclair State University and Youth Consultation Service (YCS). Over the years, Ernie became a passionate advocate for early childhood development, and YCS in 1991 named their special education center in Union City, NJ the Ernest M. May Academy. Recently he received the ''Thea Bry Award'' from YCS for ''a lifetime of service to others, giving a voice for those who have none''. Devoted husband and Pater familias, Ernie is survived by Betty, his wife of 62 years, his sister Helen Strauss, his sons Ernie D. and Jim, his daughter Susan, ten grandchildren and six greatgrandchildren. May God grant him peace. A memorial service will be held on Saturday, December 14, 2002 at 11 AM at Calvary Episcopal Church, Summit, NJ. In lieu of flowers donations in his name may be made to YCS Endowment Fund, 284 Broadway, Newark, NJ 07104.
