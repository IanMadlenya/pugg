        BURACK-Zahava. It is with deep sorrow that we record the death of Zahava Burack, a Vice President and past Guest of Honor. Zahava was a dedicated worker for education in the State of Israel. A deep void will be left in our ranks with her passing. To her son Jeff and her sisters, we offer our sincerest condolences.
