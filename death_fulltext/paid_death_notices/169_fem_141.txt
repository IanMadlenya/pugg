        BEZAHLER-Hannah. Died February 14, 2001 in her 93rd year, in Miami, Florida. Widow of Joel Bezahler, mother of Arline Schwartz and Donald J. Bezahler. Her sonin-law Mac, her daughter-in-law Suzanne, her brother and sister-inlaw George and Mindy, her sister Syd, her grandchildren Ellen, Renee, David and Amber, and her great grandchildren Ryan and Adam all mourn her passing. To the end, Hannah was tough. She succumbed only after a bitter fight against illness and advanced age. She loved everyone in her own way, and is finally at peace with herself and with those whom she loved. The last eight months established an entirely new bond between her and her children, and, for that, we are eternally grateful. Interment at Mount Hebron Cemetery in Flushing, NY, Sunday, February 18th at 10:30 A.M. In lieu of flowers, please donate to your favorite charity.
