        WEINSTEIN-Laurence A. The Board and Staff of the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research mourn the passing of our friend and esteemed Board member, Laurence A. Weinstein, on October 27, 1998. His was a genuine commitment to preserving and teaching the rich Yiddish culture of East European Jewry. Through his support of the Max and Frieda Weinstein Archive of Sound Recordings at YIVO, Laurence Weinstein helped preserve rare field recordings of the Y.L. Cahan Folklore Club, interviews with refugees in German D.P. camps, cultural events and music, much of it in Yiddish. This sound archive is at the heart of the current Yiddish cultural renaissance. YIVO sends our deepest condolences to his family. May his memory be for a blessing. Koved zayn ondenk! Bruce Slovin, Chairman YIVO Institute for Jewish Research
