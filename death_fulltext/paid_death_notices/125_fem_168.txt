        ROSE-Elaine Asher. The members of the New York Wellesley College Friends of Art mourn the untimely passing of their longtime associate Elaine Asher Rose. The Friends of Art and the Davis Museum and Cultural Center at Wellesley have benefitted immeasurably from her vision, energy, and sound advice over many years. She will be sorely missed. To honor her, a memorial fund has been established at the College for the purchase of a work of art in her name.
        ROSE-Elaine. The Volunteer Organization of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourns the loss of Elaine Rose, our friend and colleague of 25 years. Her dedication and courage continue to be an inspiration to all of us. We will miss her companionship, and we extend our deepest sympathy to her loving husband, Kenneth, and to her children Karen and Michael.
