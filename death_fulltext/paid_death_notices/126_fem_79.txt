        MONROE-Phyllis. We mourn the untimely loss of our dear friend and former colleague, Phyllis Monroe. She was a highly capable and intelligent lawyer, a warm human being who possessed a wonderful sense of humor. She will be sorely missed and may she rest in peace. Robert M. Morgenthau and the Staff of The New York County District Attorney's Office.
