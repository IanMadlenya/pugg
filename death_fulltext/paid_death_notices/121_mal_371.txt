        O'CONNOR-Wilfred R. Judge of the Civil Court, former Director of the Legal Aid Society's Prison Legal Assistants' Program, and former Associate Attorney-In-Charge at the Queens Supreme Court Branch of the Legal Aid Society, on January 23, 1997 at Calvary Hospital. The Board, members and staff of the New York State Defenders Association mourn his death. He was a founding member of our association, who served with distinction as President (1978-1989), and brought us into the spirit by which he lived - pure devotion to the belief that everyone, including the disadvantaged, have a right to the equal protection of the law. Our friend Bill will be greatly missed and we extend to his family our prayers and deep sympathy.
