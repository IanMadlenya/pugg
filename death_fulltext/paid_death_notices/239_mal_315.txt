        SMYTH--Craig Hugh. The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn the passing of Craig Hugh Smyth, a highly revered scholar of the Renaissance as well as an inspiring colleague and friend. He was an Honorary Trustee of the Metropolitan since 1968, and during his more than two decades as director of the Institute of Fine Arts at NYU, coorganized with this institution many educational programs that benefited art students, experts, and the public. His many contributions to the art world will not be forgotten. We extend condolences to his wife Barbara and to his entire family. James R. Houghton, Chrman Philippe de Montebello, Dir Emily K. Rafferty, President
