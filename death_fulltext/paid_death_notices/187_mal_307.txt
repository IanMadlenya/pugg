        MARGOLIES-Jacques. The New York Philharmonic notes with grief and sadness the death, on August 29, of Jacques Margolies, 85, a deeply valued member of the Philharmonic's violin section. Mr. Margolies, who received a Philharmonic-Symphony Society of New York scholarship at age 13, originally joined the Orchestra in 1942, but left in 1946 to pursue a solo career. He returned to the Philharmonic in 1964, and was due to retire on October 1, 2002. Over the years he enjoyed an extremely varied career, including recitals in Europe and at Town Hall and Carnegie Hall; serving as concertmaster of Ballet Theatre Orchestra under Antal Dorati, Carnegie Pops, the orchestra of Jackie Gleason's ''The Honeymooners'' television series, and the ''My Fair Lady'' orchestra; playing in dance bands, in radio orchestras, including the NBC Symphony under Toscanini, and even for tea at the Plaza Hotel. He was a member of the Philharmonic on November 14, 1943, the history-making day when Leonard Bernstein took the podium to fill in for an ailing Bruno Walter. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife Ruth, his daughters Eva and Caryn, his granddaughter Rachel and to his entire family. Funeral services will be private. Members of the Orchestra Paul B. Guenther, Chairman Zarin Mehta, Exec. Dir.
