        WICZYK--Yaakov. The true greatness of a man's achievement in life is measured by how many lives he touched. For us, your kindess, caring and concern was always there. Through the years you were the foundation of our family. You were our rock. You touched us by your gentle smile. You were our guardian angel. Our deepest sympathy to the family. We have not only lost a beautiful son-in-law, dear brotherin-law and great-uncle, but a truly great man. You will always be in our hearts forever.
