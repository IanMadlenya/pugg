        JACOBOVITS-Rabbi Lord Immanuel. Esteemed member of Board of Directors of Medical Research Foundation of Israel. We will miss his support, advice and leadership. He was a shining light of morality in a confused world. A man of peace. A master of communication. He followed the lead of our forefathers, opened his house in Dublin, New York and London to welcome congregants and strangers. A moralist in medicine and in life. A penchant to act against the unjust. Our condolences to his dear wife Amalie. He spiritually enriched our lives. Derek Enlander, President Lawrence Friedland, Vice Pres. George Dallal, Treasurer
