        SCHNEIDER-Ruth (nee Anhang). It is with great sadness that we record the passing of Ruth Schneider in New York on December 10, 1997 (11 Kislev 5758) after a 28year battle with scleroderma. Despite the near-constant pain and suffering, she courageously and with great determination led an active and productive life and taught in Winnipeg, Toronto, Israel and New York. She is survived by her loving and devoted husband Dr. Samuel Schneider, her loving children Solomon Bernard and Stephanie Cheryl, her loving mother Mina of Toronto and three loving brothers, William of Montreal, Jacob of Toronto and Abraham of Winnipeg, and their families. She was laid to rest in Toronto on December 12, 1997. She will be deeply missed and never forgotten. Contributions may be made to the Scleroderma Federation, New York University Medical Center and Yeshiva University.
