        $(6$)FISHMAN--Stuart. Finally the suffering is over! You always set an example for me on how to live one's life -family first, caring for friends and concern for the community. It's easy for me to understand why I was so proud that you were by big brother. I will always love you, miss you and think of you everyday. Jackie Kaminsky
