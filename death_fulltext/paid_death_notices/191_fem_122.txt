        FERMAN-Bernice. On December 11, 2002. Devoted wife of the late Robert Ferman, mother to Pam and Seth, mother-in-law to Nick and Miriam, and grandmother to Robbie, Jake, Samantha and Rae-four children who enjoyed an open invitation to her candy dishes. She was born to Max and Bluma Chariton in Philadelphia and raised during the Depression. She showed artistic talent at an early age and received several art scholarships. She enjoyed her art work throughout her life and at age 65 her sandblasted, handpainted glass vessels were being shown in galleries around the world. Bernice and Bob had a close and happy marriage. They traveled extensively and shared laughter in all corners of the globe. When Bob began suffering from a debilitating illness, Bernice's selflessness and devotion to him grew even stronger. A woman full of love and kindness, Bernice had no place for negativity or pessimism in her life. Instead, she was always quick with a smile. She cared deeply for those close to her and was always willing to invite new friends into that group. She saw the good side of people and eagerly embraced it. She was an exceptional woman who will be terribly missed. Services Sunday, 11:15 AM, at The Riverside, 180 W. 76th St.
