        GOODWIN--Jacqueline. TheSouthampton Fresh Air Home, a camp for physically challenged children, mourns the loss of Jacqueline Goodwin, a member of its Board of Directors and a former President. Mrs. Goodwin's loyalty, generosity and commitment to the Home brought joy to many, many children who spent summers there during her long tenure as a Director. Her sense of beauty and her empathy for physically challenged children and their families were a model of leadership for all who knew her and worked with her over the years. She will continue to be a source of strength and an inspiration to her friends and colleagues at the Southampton Fresh Air Home, who remember her as a fun loving, sports minded person, who always pitched in to help her friends whenever she was needed. She will be dearly missed and fondly remembered. The Home extends its deepest sympathy to Mrs. Goodwin's family, whom she loved so much.
