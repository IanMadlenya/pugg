        KHAN--Karen. With deep sorrow we announce the passing of Karen Khan. She is survived by her loving partner Riva, her children Christopher, Kisha, Sarah and Esther, her sisters and brothers Suzi and Bob, and David and Nancy, her niece Morgan Lily, her nephews Nick, Tyler and Julian, and countless other people whose lives she nurtured. Karen lived life with passionate joy, great patience and kindness, and understanding of possibility. We will miss her forever. Services Thursday, 3PM, Plaza Jewish Community Chapel.
