        FREUND--Vivian. We extend heartfelt condolences to Robert Freund, Lilly Mansbach, her six children and many grandchildren on the loss of his wife, her daughter, their mother and grandmother. A warm and kind person, her positive attitude and modest demeanor made her a role model to those who had the good fortune of knowing her. A Silver Founder of the Medical Center together with Robert, her outstretched hand of kindness touched many. May the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
