        KAY--Sid. Died on September 18 in New York Hospital. Leaving behind the love of a family that will miss him deeply: his adored and adoring wife of 62 years, Rose; siblings Estelle, Jack, Mel, Herbert, Gloria and Alvin. Nieces, nephews, great nieces and great-nephews. Mr. Kay, who founded Miss Youthform Lingerie and Peacock Linens had interests that included religion, politics, journalism, literature and theatre. The key to Sid's personality was his ability to read, to listen, to learn and then to speak profoundly and knowledgeably. He was a gentleman and a gentle man. Mr. Kay was put to rest in Hebrew Friendship Cemetery in Baltimore, MD. His family will be home September 22-24 from 12-8PM at 220 E. 72nd, NYC. We bid him farewell and a peaceful journey.
