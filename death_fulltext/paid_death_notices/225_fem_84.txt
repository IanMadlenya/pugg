        McNEILL--Charlotte. The partners, associates and staff of Chadbourne & Parke LLP mourn with great sadness the passing on October 9, 2005 of our cherished friend and colleague. Charlotte joined Chadbourne in 1952 and was an integral part of Chadbourne for 53 years. During her long journey with the firm, she assumed numerous responsibilities, rising to become the firm's secretarial supervisor. Charlotte was a loving and generous person, a wise and kind mentor and teacher, always a bundle of energy, and an inspiration to all who worked with her. She will be greatly missed. A funeral mass will take place on Thursday, October 13, at 10:30 AM at Our Lady of Visitation R.C. Church, 234 Farview Avenue, Paramus, N.J. Donations may be made to St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, 501 St. Jude Place, Memphis, TN 38105.
