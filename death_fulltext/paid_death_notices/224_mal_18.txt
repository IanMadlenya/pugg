        COHEN--Herbert. Bronx native, 65, died after a long and difficult struggle with hydrocephalus. He was predeceased by his beloved wife, Cecilia Collins Cohen, and is survived by his adoring children, Dorothy and Emily Cohen. In addition to being a devoted husband and father, Herb was above all a teacher. He served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Ankara, Turkey, a city he returned to twenty years later as a Fulbright Scholar. Herb earned a PhD at the University of Iowa. He enjoyed a twenty-five year career at Arizona State University where his passion for teaching and education inspired countless students, including his daughters, to become teachers. Though friends and family deeply mourn his loss, all are comforted that Herb finally has rejoined the wife and dogs he so greatly missed. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be made to the Hospice of the Valley.
