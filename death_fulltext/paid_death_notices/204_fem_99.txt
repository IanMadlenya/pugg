        PRYSTOWSKY--Rose, MD. The President and Board of Trustees of Montefiore Medical Center are deeply saddened by the death of Rose Prystowsky, MD, beloved mother of Michael Prystowsky, MD, university chair, Department of Pathology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine and pathologist-in-chief, Montefiore Medical Center. Dr. Prystowsky, a child psychiatrist, died in a house fire early Wednesday that critically injured her pediatrician husband, Milton, and also killed her live-in nurse. Dr. Prystowsky was the only woman graduate in her medical class and she received her training in psychiatry at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York City. She also held a Master's degree in public health from Johns Hopkins University. She and her husband raised five boys, all of whom became doctors. The medical community, the thousands of patients she cared for, and the entire Montefiore family grieve this tremendous loss. Our condolences go out to her husband, Milton, and her sons, Dr. Stephen of New York City, Dr. Eric of Indiana, Dr. Barry of Nutley, NJ, Dr. Richard of California, and Dr. Michael of New York City, and her 14 grandchildren. Spencer Foreman, MD, President Jay B. Langner, Chairman Board of Trustees Montefiore Medical Center
