        ROSENTHAL--Herbert Martin. To the many friends, family members, colleagues, children and animals who knew and loved my father well, he was unequivocally like a god; unequivocally like a god. On September 30, from 2-5 pm, there was held a second memorial service in remembrance to two little legends of Woodstock long ago. They were Herbert Martin Rosenthal (1913-1997) and his remarkable wife Irmgard Helene Busenhart-Rosenthal (1920-1989). Again at the barn on the Peter Whitehead Estate in Upper Byrdcliffe, the lovely old artist colony in Woodstock, above Glasgow Turnpike.
