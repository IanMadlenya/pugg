        BROWN-Earle. We respected him, as did so many, for his humanity, his music, and his tenacity. Although his music has not yet been as widely appreciated as it deserves, Earle's legacy will live on, continuing to inspire all who come after him. We send our deepest sympathies to his wife, Susan Sollins, and to their families. Agnes Gund & Daniel Shapiro
