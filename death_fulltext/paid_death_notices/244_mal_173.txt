        MURPHY--Bernard Carl, 67, died May 16th, 2007, of lung cancer in Manhattan. A consummate New Yorker, Mr. Murphy was an avid collector of New York City books and memorabilia, many of them extremely rare. He died at Cabrini Hospice with his much loved Chrysler Building outside the window. He was a commercial artist at Sudler & Hennessey, the leading medical ad agency (a division of Y&R), for over 40 years, and retired just three years ago. Bernie also was an accomplished portrait painter and had studied at the Arts Student League. He was born in Easton, Pennsylvania, but raised in Newark, New Jersey. He came to New York City 50 years ago this year. He is survived by his loving partner of 38 years, Terry Lilly, his nephews Timothy Fahey (Fredericksburg, Virginia), Patrick Murphy (Modesto, California), and Jim Murphy (Fredericksburg), his niece Kelly Sigethy (Woodbridge, Virginia), his sister-inlaw Carleen Murphy (Fairfax, Virginia), nine grandnieces and -nephews, as well as scores of loving friends. He is preceded in death by his father Carl Murphy, his mother Geraldine, his brother Patrick and his beloved sister, Jacqueline Fahey. Donations in his memory may be made to Cabrini Hospice, who took beautiful care of him. A memorial service will be announced in the near future.
