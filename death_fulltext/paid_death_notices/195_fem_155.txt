        FUCHSBERG - Shirley G. Touro College Jacob D. Fuchsberg Law Center mourns the loss of our cherished friend, wise counselor, and generous benefactor. As a member of the Law School's Board of Visitors, Shirley was a source of strength and wisdom, providing leadership and guidance-always tempered with reality, humor and style. She was a true philanthropist-giving generously of her time and talent, along with her financial support. Her love of life and generosity of spirit will be sorely missed. She was intensely devoted to her family, but yet found the time to share her smile and her warmth with countless friends and charitable endeavors. To Roz and Dick, Susan and Ralph, Janet and Peter, and Alan and Robin along with her many grandchildren and greatgrandchildren, we extend our deepest sympathies and join you in celebrating her life. Howard A. Glickstein, Dean
