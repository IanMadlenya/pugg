        JOHNSON -- George. The Board of Directors, officers and employees of Mutual of America record with deep sorrow the passing of George E. Johnson. Mr. Johnson was a former acting president, member of the Board of Trustees, and a dear friend. In later years, he made his home in Tucson, AZ. For close to fifteen years, he shared with us his extensive knowledge of the insurance industry. Before joining Mutual of America, he served as Vice President and General Counsel of TIAA, as well as founder and president of both VALIC and EALIC. In 1961, Mr. Johnson wrote ''Variable Annuities and Variable Life Insurance, Variable Pensions, Investment Annuities, Economic Index Annuities, Separate Accounts: The Most Complete Book Ever Written on Variable Annuities.'' At the time, it was the most comprehensive book written on this subject. In 1967, along with Donald S. Grubbs, Mr. Johnson wrote, ''The Variable Annuity: A New and Exciting Financial Tool.'' Mr. Johnson was a member of the New York Bar Association, a Chartered Life Underwriter, a Fellow of the Life Office Management Association Institute, a Fellow of the Gerontological Society and a past member of the Life Insurance Council. George Johnson was a man of ideas. Through his work on the Long-Range Objectives Committee, he helped plan for the future needs of Mutual of America's clients. To him we owe a great debt of gratitude. His wife Elizabeth and son George E. Johnson, III, preceded him in death. We extend our sincere condolences to his children, Susan Hartdegan, and Robert A. Johnson. William J. Flynn, Chairman of the Board Thomas J. Moran, President and CEO Mutual of America Life Insurance Company
