        BERNSTEIN--Harold. Rabbi Jeret found the essence of Harold saying, ''He was the greatest man I ever knew''. To me he was the mentor, father I never had, and the grandfather Kathy always wanted for our children. Because our grief is so heartfelt, we know the loss to Helen and the family is beyond words. Our deepest sympathy is extended to them. The Leinbach Family
