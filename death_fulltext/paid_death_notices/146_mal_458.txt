        KANOF-Abram. The Trustees and staff of The Jewish Museum mourn the loss of Dr. Abram Kanof, past Board President and longtime friend, colleague and supporter of The Museum. An acknowledged leader in the field of Jewish Cermonial Art, Dr. Kanof's collecting and patronage combined his love of Judaism and art. His enthusiasm, scholarship and vision influenced the creation of The Tobe Pascher Workshop devoted to the creation of contemporary cermonial art. Our deepest sympathy is extended to his entire family. Robert Hurst, Chairman Philip Laskawy, President Joan Rosenbaum, Director
