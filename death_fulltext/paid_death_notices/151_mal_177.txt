        KIRKLAND-Lane. The officers, members and staff of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union mourn the loss of retired AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland. He was a champion of working people not just in the United States but throughout the world. His words and actions gave voice to the yearnings for dignity, democracy and freedom of those whose own voices were all too often muted by intimidation in the workplace at home or by the abuse of power abroad. Lane Kirkland believed in the dignity of work and working people and devoted his life to the struggles for justice and freedom. We witness his legacy every day wherever working people strive for, achieve and enjoy the rights and freedoms they deserve. Our heartfelt sympathy goes out to his wife, Irena. Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, UFCW, AFL-CIO, CLC Stuart Appelbaum, President Charlie Hall, Sr., Secretary-Treasurer Lenore Miller, President Emeritus
