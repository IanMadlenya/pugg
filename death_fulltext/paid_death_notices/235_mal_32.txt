        SIMRING--Noah. The Horace Mann School is in deep anguish at the tragic passing of its cherished student Noah Simring '03. A charismatic, principled, iconoclastic student, he was respected and admired by all who knew him. An active member of the HM community he greatly contributed to the life and mind of the school. OUr thoughts and prayers are with his parents, Drs. Ruth and James Simring, his sister, Mia '99, and all his friends who cherished his time on earth. We share in your grief. Dr. Thomas M.
