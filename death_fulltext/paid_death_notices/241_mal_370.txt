        SCHACHTER--Rabbi Melech. The Yeshiva University and RIETS family mourn the passing of a distinguished Torah scholar who, for 46 years, was the central pillar of the Halachah L'Maaseh program at RIETS where he held the Rabbi Dr. and Mrs. Leon Katz Professorship in Rabbinics. His writings on a wide range of Torah studies, his mentorship, and passion for Torah learning inspired countless numbers of students-including his own sonand won the love and admiration of his colleagues. Husband of Clair, of blessed memory, in addition to son Rabbi Hershel (and Shoshana) Schachter, Rosh Kollel, Adina and Marcos D. Katz Kollel and Nathan and Vivian Fink Distinguished Professor of Talmud, he leaves a daughter, Sara (and Yisrael Mayer) Steinberg, 12 grandchildren and 33 great grandchildren. May the family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M.
