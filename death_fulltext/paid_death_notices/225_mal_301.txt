        MARA--Wellington. We deeply mourn the loss of Wellington Mara, the great patriarch of the New York Giants football team. He was an ideal partner, a wonderful person, and most of all a great family man who extended the feeling of ''family'' to the entire Giants team. We send our deepest condolences to his wife, Ann, his children and grandchildren. Bob and Joan Tisch Jamie and Steve Tisch Laurie Tisch Jonathan Tisch
