        GUEDALIA--Judah. Those privileged to worship under his steady eye, dignified demeanor and commanding presence, will forever revere his memory as the guardian of the Minhagim; the rituals of which Shearith Israel, forever remains the American guardian par excellance of our English and Dutch forebears. May his light be perpetuated by our presence. Alvin Deutsch, Hon. Parnas
