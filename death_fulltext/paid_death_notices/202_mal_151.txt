        KARLIN--Leonard. On November 14, at age 81, following a brief illness. Editor, wordsmith, writer of elegance and wit. He had a lifelong association with Long Island University, where he taught journalism, directed public relations, and served on the Polk Awards Committee from its inception. His wife, Lee Karlin, died before him, as did his sisters, Ethel and Gertrude, and his brothers-in-law, Isidore Cytron and Meyer Isenman. He is survived by his daughters: Elisabeth, of Manhattan; Katherine, of Pittsburgh; Susannah, of Long Beach, LI; by his sons-in-law, Joshua Zaret and Christopher Remple; and by many nieces, nephews, grandnieces and grandnephews of the Cytron, Isenman and Schor families. We loved him. A service will be held on Sunday, November 23, at the Riverside-Nassau North Chapel, Great Neck, at 1 PM; 516487-9600. In lieu of flowers, please send contributions to the Len Karlin Scholarship at Long Island University.
