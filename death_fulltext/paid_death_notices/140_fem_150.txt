        EDEY-Helen Winthrop, M.D. The William Alanson White Psychoanalytic Institute is grieved at the loss of an extraordinary colleague. After graduating in 1962, Dr. Edey distinguished herself in many areas & became a member of the Institute's Board of Trustees in 1969. Her implacable social consciousness and the depth and breadth of her devotion to the betterment of humankind lit our way. Of those who will miss her and of those who will remember her, we are among the countless. Profound condolences to her beloved family. Charles C. Harrington, Ph.D. President, Board of Trustees Marylou Lionells, PhD, Director, White Institute
