        SCHWARTZ -- Simon. The United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism mourns the passing of Simon Schwartz, International President of the United Synagogue from 1977-1981. During his many years of dedicated service to our organization, he demonstrated a firm commitment to Jewish education and to the State of Israel. A kind and compassionate man, he will long be remembered for his tireless efforts on behalf of the entire Jewish community. We extend our condolences to his wife Ruth, and to his children.
