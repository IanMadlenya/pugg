        RESNICK-Pearl. The Joseph L. Morse Geriatric Center and the Morse Women's Auxilary mourns the loss of longtime friend, supporter and benefactor, Pearl Resnick, and extends its sincerest condolences to the entire Resnick family on their loss. Pearl was a strong advocate of the Morse Geriatric Center and the Women's Auxilary and helped create many annual fundraisers to benefit the Center's residents. In December 1989, Morse Geriatric Center was able to expand through the generosity of herself and late husband Jack Resnick, with the dedication of the Resnick 160-bed nursing pavillion. She served as an inspiration to the entire Jewish community and to everyone she touched with her compassion and grace. She will be greatly missed by all of us.
