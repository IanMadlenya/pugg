        HERNDON-Venable. New York University's Tisch School of the Arts and the Dramatic Writing Program express their deep sorrow at the passing of Venable Herndon, longtime beloved teacher of screenwriting. He was a gifted writer whose work was an exemplar to our students. We extend our sincere condolences to Sharon Anson and her family. To honor his memory, the School will establish the Venable Herndon Scholarship Fund. Donations may be sent to NYU Tisch School of the Arts, 721 Broadway, 12th Floor, NY, NY 10003, Attn: Donna Consolini. A memorial is planned for February.
