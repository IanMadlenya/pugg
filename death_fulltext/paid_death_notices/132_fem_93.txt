        WALLACH-Phyllis. The officers and members of the United Federation of Teachers mourn the loss of a revered officer, a remarkable teacher, a respected pension expert and a beloved colleague and friend. She served her union and all its members brilliantly as a teacher member of the Retirement Board where her caring concern for members drove every decision. Her dignity, her dedication, her wisdom and her patience in advising UFT members will be remembered personally by the thousands she helped at crucial points in their lives. We will sorely miss her counsel, her knowledge and her infinite common sense. Our deepest sympathies to her husband Victor, her children, Barbara, Rebecca, and Steven, and her daughter-in-law, Ilana. Sandra Feldman, President United Federation of Teachers
