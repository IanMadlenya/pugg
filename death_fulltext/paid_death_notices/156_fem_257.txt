        ROBERTS-Bettina. The American-Israeli Lighthouse and its affiliate chapters mourn the passing of their dear friend and benefactor Bettina Roberts, beloved wife of Norman Roberts. Her devotion and dedication to our work for Israel's blind will be greatly missed. They made possible the establishment of the Bettina and Norman Roberts Low-Vision Clinic. We are most grateful for their compassion and support of our programs throughout the years. We extend our deepest sympathy to Norman. Mrs. Leonard F. Dank, President
