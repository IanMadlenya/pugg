        SCHEIN-Eliot DeY. Of South Salem, NY. On April 2, 1999 after a courageous struggle, at age 58. President of Schein/Blattstein Advertising, professor at Pace University, author, columnist, speaker, past president of NY Direct Marketing Club and a leading voice in the industry. Eliot was a devoted son of the late Max and Claire (Rosenwald) Schein. The loving partner of Elizabeth Krajcsik. A good-hearted and loving nephew and cousin. A caring and cherished ''adopted'' uncle. And an attentive and unswervingly loyal friend. He loved life and all that was good and fine in it. He touched many lives and will be missed by all. To those who wish to pay tribute Eliot would no doubt suggest live each day, savor its gifts, and do the right thing. A Memorial Service will be held 4pm on on Thursday, April 15th, at ''The Riverside'', 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue.
