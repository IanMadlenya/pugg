        KAMENY-Ellen. A wonderful person, with a host of good and faithful friends. Caring, gentle, always concerned with the comfort and well-being of others, with their joys and pains. A special area of her life was devoted to music which she deeply loved. She was dedicated to her family, especially her grandchildren whose photos and sayings she often shared. I'll miss her friendly calls, our concert visits, our dinners, the special cookies she baked for me and above all, our easy warm friendship. Helen Kaufmann
