A music lover in the purest and most profound sense, and a consummate gentleman, his contributions to Aston Magna were many and important. His intellect, gentleness, decency and good, common sense will be sorely missed by all who were privileged to know him. Board of Directors Aston Magna Foundation for Music and the Humanities, Inc.
