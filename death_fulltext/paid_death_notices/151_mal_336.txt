        KAHN-Harry. Harry Kahn's heart was immense and it was in all the right places. He was a brilliant economist who cared deeply about how people are influenced by economic policy. He believed passionately in the first amendment and devoted himself to its protection. He revelled in the beauty that art brought into our lives and our world. We will miss his presence, spirit and his commitment to the American Way. Carole Shields, President, People for the American Way Barbara Handman, Vice President/Director NY Office, People for the American Way
        KAHN-Harry. People for the American Way, its board and staff and everyone who cares about justice, tolerance and equal opportunity in America have lost a great friend in the passing of Harry Kahn. I looked forward to every moment with Harry and I came more and more to appreciate his innate goodness and common sense. I will miss his smile, his person and his counsel. Norman Lear, Chair, People for the American Way Foundation
