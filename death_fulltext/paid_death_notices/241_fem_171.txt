Miss Rogers served on the original Consumer Council of the American National Standards Institute, on the Governors Council of Women, appointed by thenGovernor Nelson Rockefeller of New York and was selected as one of the Distinguished Women of New York. A native of Jackson, Tennessee, Miss Rogers was appointed in 1969 by President Nixon to assume responsibility as White House Consumer Affairs Adviser. But she withdrew her nomination when Congressman Ben Rosenthal (D-NY) objected, citing possible conflict of interests with her employer, Good Housekeeping Magazine. Per her request, funeral services are to be private.
