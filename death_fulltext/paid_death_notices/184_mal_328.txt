        BUCHBERG-Abraham S., MD. The President and Trustees of Montefiore Medical Center are profoundly saddened by the passing of Abraham S. Buchberg, MD, an esteemed colleague and friend. Dr. Buchberg was a devoted teacher and senior attending physician in the Division of Pulmonary Medicine when he retired in 1998. He served as director of the division from 1965 until 1972 and was on the medical staff for over 50 years. Dr. Buchberg inspired three generations of pulmonary physician scientists and was one of a select group of Clinical Professors of Medicine at Montefiore. He was honored by the Medical Center's Staff and Alumni Association in 1994 for his superb clinical skills combined with genuine compassion and integrity. Our heartfelt condolences are extended to his dear wife, Vera; his children Karl and Lisa; his two grandchildren, and his sister, Irene. Spencer Foreman, MD, President Jay B. Langner, Chairman Board of Trustees Montefiore Medical Center
