        KABAT--Herbert, 89, a 37 years resident of Bay Harbor Islands, FL, passed away on June 18th, 2006. Born in Cambridge, MA on June 24, 1916, he moved to Brooklyn, N.Y. as a child where his love for the Dodgers was formed. He first arrived in Miami Beach in 1943 for basic training in the U.S. Army Air Corp. where he would rise to the rank of 2nd lieutenant in the 505th Bomber Group, earning seven battle stars in the Pacific theatre. Following WW II he took the knowledge of radios and communications that he learned in the service into the field of Consumer Electronics where he would become a pioneer in the industry. In 1957 as President of Delmonico International, he became the first to import Sony radios into the United States. Subsequently Delmonico would open the U.S. market to compact refrigerators from Ignis of Italy as well as stereos and televisions from the Victor Company of Japan (JVC). Televisions from Sanyo and Gold Star would follow while he was President of Olympic International in the 1970's. He is survived by Hortense, his loving wife of 59 years; children Lawrence, Harry and Caryn; grandchildren Rebecca and Steven and sister Debra Zion.
