        BROOKS--Harvey. It is with deep sorrow that the American Academy of Arts and Sciences mourns the loss of Harvey Brooks, distinguished physicist, science policy advisor, and President of the Academy from 1971 to 1976. Throughout his fifty-three years as a Fellow of the Academy, he worked to advance its historic mission to bring together accomplished individuals from all fields and professions in service to society. He broadened the scope of the Academy's work in every direction, from its studies on international security, the environment, and social issues, to its role as the catalyst in the creation of the National Humanities Center in North Carolina. With his remarkable range of interests and concerns, he epitomized the value of the interdisciplinary enterprise, championing the importance of science in the public interest and the significance of the humanities as a critical presence in civic life. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Helen; his family, and all those touched by his brilliance, his grace, and his generosity of spirit. Patricia Meyer Spacks, President Leslie C. Berlowitz, Executive Officer Louis W. Cabot, Vice President Emilio Bizzi, Secretary John S. Reed, Treasurer
