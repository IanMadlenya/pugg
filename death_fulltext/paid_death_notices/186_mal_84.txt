        FRENCHMAN-Gerald L. 68 years old, son of the late Mildred and Harold Frenchman, loving husband and father of four, died on Saturday after a long and courageous battle with complications following heart surgery this past October. He is survived by his wife Cynthia; his four children (and daughters-inlaw) Peter (Suzie), Robert (Geraldine), Kenneth (Raquelle), and Jill; his sister Harriet (Murray); and his four grandchildren Alexander, Phoebe, Tyler, and Ashley. Jerry was a devoted family man who supported his children in all their endeavors, spending many seasons coaching his children's teams while they were young. This support evolved into other forms of mentorship in later years. Utilizing his business expertise, as well as his strong moral fiber, Jerry set an example for his children that was unmatched by others. A tax accountant by trade, Jerry became one of a small nucleus of inside executives at Continental Grain Company, where he worked in excess of 35 years. Upon retiring in 1999, Jerry and Cindy relocated from Scarsdale, where they had lived 25 years, to Cordillera Colorado. In Cordillera, Jerry had planned to continue his consulting and investment activities, while taking the time to enjoy a life of skiing and golfing in the Colorado sunshine. Jerry was a fierce competitor who participated in a variety of athletic activities, including skiing, marathon running, triathlons, cycling, basketball and (belatedly) golf. Even after the onset of Parkinson's disease, Jerry continued to pursue those activities that defined him. Whether it be cheering for his beloved Colorado Buffaloes, running that 26th mile, or persevering beyond anyone's imagination, Jerry gave it his all. He will be missed by all. Services to be held at The Riverside Memorial, Amsterdam at 76th Street, New York, New York. Following services, the family will sit shiva through Friday at the Frenchman's home, 74 Jared Drive, White Plains, New York.
