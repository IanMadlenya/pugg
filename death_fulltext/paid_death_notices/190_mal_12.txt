        MANN-Bernard. To know Bernie was a special gift and one that we will cherish for the rest of our lives. Bernie was a man who never said no and his favorite expression was ''Do you need anything''. All we ever needed from Bernie was his love, happy face and friendship which will never be duplicated. To know Bernie was to love him and we already feel our hearts broken. We love you, Bernie. Hank and Elena Spierer
