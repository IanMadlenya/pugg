        FLEISCHNER -- Irwin. Sur prise Lake Camp mourns the loss of Irwin Fleischner, our Past President and Board member for over 30 years. He epitomized the kind of wit and wisdom nonprofits covet on their boards, and he inherited and passed on a unique and special commitment to our agency on the part of generations of the Holman/ Fleischner family. We extend our deepest sympathies to his lovely wife Ruth, to his children, Ben, Jennifer, David, Judy, and to his grandchildren.
