        LANE--Jodie S. The faculty, staff, administration, students and trustees of Teachers College, Columbia University profoundly mourn the tragic passing of Jodie Lane on Friday, January 16. Jodie received her M.S. in 2002 and was a fifth-year doctoral student in our program in Clinical Psychology. She was an excellent student, researcher and clinician. She was working on a book for children who suffered from OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder). She had published articles in professional journals and was an extremely talented therapist who cared deeply about her patients. Jodie was a rare and wonderful woman who will truly be missed by all. Our condolences to her mother Karen, father Roger and stepmother Jill, brother Jacob and boyfriend Alex. A memorial service at Teachers College is scheduled for Thursday, January 22, at 6PM in Milbank Chapel. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Jodie S. Lane Memorial Fund, Wells Fargo Bank, 10400 Research Blvd, Austin, TX. 78759. Arthur Levine, President, Teachers College, Columbia University
