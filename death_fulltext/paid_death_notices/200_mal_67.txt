        BASSO -- Dominic Walter. Died suddenly on August 22, 2003. A graduate of the H.S. of Art & Design and Pratt Institute, he founded Dominic Basso Design in the early 1980's, becoming nationally renowned for his unique architectural and decorative styles. He was a devoted brother, a beloved uncle, and a cherished friend whose sense of humor was only matched by his thoughtfulness and compassion. Although his time here was short, his impact on those around him was tremendous. He left us with empty hearts, but his goodness will live on in each of us. A memorial to be held at a future date, will be attended by family and friends.
