        MELAMED-Moises. On March 17, 1998. Devoted father of Deborah Melamed and the late Steven Melamed, and like a father to Vicki Passman. A uniquely kind and generous man with boundless energy and love, who took such good care of all of us. We are indescribably sad at losing him. Services Thursday, March 19th, 1:15 PM at ''The Riverside'', 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue.
