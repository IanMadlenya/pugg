        ELLIOTT-Timothy Charles Venn. Tim, passed away at home in Manhattan, early morning December 30 after a short but courageous battle with pancreatic cancer, at age 51. Born in Dorset, England, educated at Harrow School, Cambridge University, and in the far flung reaches of the world, Tim's humor and selfless concern for others remained intact until the end. While several global advertising agencies have lost a rare breed of leader, the world has lost an irreplaceable eccentric and lover of life far too soon. May his generosity, spirit and enthusiasm be remembered with more than the glasses that will be raised to him. Tim is survived by Daryl, his wife and partner in life's great adventures, family members in England and Canada and a legion of godchildren, friends and admirers around the world. A service will be held in celebration of his life on Friday, January 7th at 1:PM at St. Vincent Ferrer Church, Lexington Ave and 66th. Contributions in his memory in lieu of flowers can be made to Visiting Nurse Service of NY, 1250 Broadway, 4th Flr, NY, NY 10001, care of Renee Martinez or The Lustgarten Foundation for Cancer Research, P.O. Box 2141, New York, New York 10116.
