        FRANCO--Anthony, on March 16, 2007. The longterm resident of Mamaroneck, NY arrived in Chicago from Italy in 1963. His brilliance and passion gave him the strength and vision to learn English and start an incredible career that saw him from the mail room at First Chicago to being one of its V.P. He later joined Banca Popolare di Milano as President and made it a great Italian presence in the U.S. He was magnanimous in his love and his spirit lives on through the many lives he touched. Many were blessed to have him as a father figure. Beloved husband to Sylvi, cherished father to Christina, Michele and Anthony, loving stepfather to Kara, proud and adoring grandfather to Anthony, Damian, Zach, Grant and Alex. Dear brother to Rita, Raffaelle and Aldo. Caring uncle to Vincenzo and Dina. Funeral services will be held at St. Augustine's Church in Larchmont, NY on Saturday, March 24th, at 10 am. Donations in his name can be made to the Eleanor and Lou Gehrig MDA/ALS Research Center at Columbia University. 710 West 168th St., New York, NY 10032.
