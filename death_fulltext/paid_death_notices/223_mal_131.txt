        GALLAGHER--Cornelius. On behalf of our entire organization, we wish to extend our heartfelt sympathy to the Gallagher family on the passing on August 11, 2005, of our Senior Vice President and Managing Director, Cornelius Gallagher, a distinguished New York City real estate broker for more than 45 years and recipient of the Real Estate Board of New York's coveted Henry Forster Award. An icon to all who worked with and competed against him--he was the epitome of grace and professionalism. He will be sorely missed but never forgotten as he was a very special man.
