        MEYER - Sheldon. Oxford University Press mourns the loss of its friend and legendary editor, Sheldon Meyer, who for more than half a century made a distinctive contribution to the worlds of scholarship and serious nonfiction publishing. Sheldon's devotion to ideas, his commitment to his authors and his friends, and his appetite for life in all its many manifestations-from history to music to baseball-will live on in the books that he so expertly helped bring into being. We know we speak for the thousands of Sheldon's authors and fans when we say that he will be greatly missed. Our thoughts and sympathies are with his family and friends.
