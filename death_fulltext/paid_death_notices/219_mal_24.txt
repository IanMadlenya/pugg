        GALASSO--Ralph. All of us at David Yurman deeply mourn the untimely passing of our beloved friend, counsel and Board member, Ralph Galasso. We miss his intelligence, humor and compassion. We express our deepest sympathies to his wife, Jane, and their children, Ali and Chris, and to all who were touched by his tenderness.
