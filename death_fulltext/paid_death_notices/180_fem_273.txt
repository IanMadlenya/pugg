        LEVINGER-Leah. All of us at Bank Street College of Education and its community mourn the passing of Leah Levinger, longtime friend and colleague, who died on January 22nd. Leah touched so many lives in so many important ways. In 1997, Bank Street College awarded Leah an honorary doctorate. Throughout her long career, as a college proffessor and a clinical child psychologist, Leah exemplified a moral and intellectual commitment to improve the lives of children. Her contributions to Bank Street and society at large will be felt by all of us for many years to come. A memorial service is being planned.
