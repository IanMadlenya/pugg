Tom served with distinction for over 40 years. As Treasurer and Chairman of our Strategic Planning Committee, Tom's vision brought to fruition many of the Hebrew Hospital Home's successful programs. Our sincere condolences to his wife Jeanne and sister Frances Gallo. Tom was a supportive and generous friend and a vital part of our organization. He will be sorely missed.
