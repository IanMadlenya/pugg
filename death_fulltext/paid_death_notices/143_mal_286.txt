        VARTANY-Alexandre, M.D. The Medical Staff at Metropolitan Hospital Center/New York Medical College notes with deep regret the passing of their friend and colleague, Alexandre Vartany, M.D., on December 19, 1998. Dr. Vartany served on the staff of Metropolitan Hospital Center for thirty-two years as a pediatric surgeon, most recently as an Associate Professor of Clinical Surgery and as an Emeritus Attending. Dr. Vartany was a dedicated physician who was held in high esteem and regard by his colleagues, staff and patients. His dedication to the patients of the East Harlem community was unwavering. Dr. Vartany's presence and guidance will be sorely missed and his colleagues wish to express their deepest sympathy to his family.
