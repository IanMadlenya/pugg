        RAMPAL-Jean-Pierre. Decades of golden music making and joy for the world and for us are JeanPierre Rampal's gifts which will always be in our hearts and memories. His joie de vivre, gentle humor and grace will be greatly missed, and his incomparable dedication to performing and to the teaching of young flutists set standards to which future generations will aspire. We are thankful and priviledged to have worked with him for forty years. Colbert Artists Management Agnes Eisenberger, President and Staff
