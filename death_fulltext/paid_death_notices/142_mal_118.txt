        DUGGAN-Stephen P. The Institute of International Education joins the Duggan family in mourning the loss of Stephen P. Duggan, an extraordinary individual whose dedication to the Institute was unparalleled. Mr. Duggan served as a Trustee, and then as a Life Trustee for almost 50 years and was a tireless advocate of international education. Mr. Duggan continued the tradition of the active role of the Duggan family in IIE affairs. He was the son of Dr. Stephen Pierce Duggan, who helped found the Institute in 1919. Respected as an exemplary leader and a good friend, Mr. Duggan's wisdom strengthened the Institute immeasurably and his spirit inspired us. He was known and beloved by staff and trustees for his dedication to the Institute. His talent, companionship, warmth and leadership will be truly missed. The Institute wishes to extend its deepest sympathies to Mr. Duggan's family. Henry Kaufman, Chairman, Board of Trustees Victor J. Goldberg, Vice Chairman Diane Paton, Vice Chairman Thomas Johnson, Chairman, Executive Committee Allan Goodman, President & CEO
