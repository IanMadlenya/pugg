        LEVINE-Leonard. After a very long and courageous battle our dear friend and associate Lenny was taken from us on Wednesday, December 19. His gentle nature and loving kindness will always be cherished as his gift to all of us. Our condolences to his wife Mimi, his children Andrea, Debra (Robert Berks), and Lisa (Steve Karczmer). His grandchildren Pamela, Jennifer, Lauren, Melissa, Rachel, Stefanie, Nicole, and Emily. And his sisters Ruth Mogul and Judy Altman. Al & Mickey & Steve, Richard Shankman Peerless Electronics Inc.
