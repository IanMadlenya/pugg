        PEAK--Robert M. We are shocked and profoundly saddened by the sudden passing of Robert M. Peak, our Partner, on Tuesday, May 13, 2003, at 48 years of age. A graduate of Georgetown University and Harvard Law School, Bob Peak joined us in 1982, became a leader in product liability defense and played a major role in our commercial, ERISA and telecommunications practices. We will miss him as a friend and colleague, and remember his unselfish attention to the interests of our firm and his willingness to take on any task asked of him.
