        SOLMAN-Ruth. 90, wife of the New York artist Joseph Solman (for 65 years), died in her sleep Saturday morning, July 17. A Ukranian-born US immigrant (1923) and NYU graduate (1932), she was a candidate for the New York State Assembly in 1952 (on the American Labor party ticket), a PTA president (at the Little Red School House), an art gallery director, Russian translator, energetic hostess and dedicated partner in the career of her husband, whom she fiercely loved, as she did her children (Paul and Ronni) and her grandchildren (Rachel Solman, Sara Rushton, Joanna Freeman-Solman and Evan Rushton). She was loved fiercely in return. Her chief illness was Parkinson's disease, from which she was in decline for the past four years. Her death was a peaceful release. She will be remembered in portraits by numerous American artists and by all who knew her. The family is receiving at home today. There will be a memorial service in the fall.
