        CASADESUS-Gaby. The House of Steinway & Sons notes with profound sadness the passing of its beloved friend and devoted Steinway Artist Gaby Casadesus, on November 12, 1999 in Paris at the age of 98. A native of Marseille, Mme. Casadesus was first taught by her mother and continued her studies at the Paris Conservatory under Marguerite Long and Louis Diemer. After a brilliant solo career in which she championed the music of such composers as Faure, Moszkowski, and Ravel, she married the renowned pianist and composer Robert Casadesus in 1921. Their collaboration resulted in one of the most celebrated piano duos in history. An acclaimed teacher, Mme. Casadesus' master classes at the Ravel Academy in St-Jean-de-Luz, the Mozarteum in Salzburg, and the Fontainebleau School were legendary. She was a co-founder of the Robert Casadesus International Piano Competition in 1975. Mme. Casadesus' discography, including a recent reissue of live performances from 1942 to 1948 by Dante Productions, will keep her legacy alive for future generations. To her daughter Therese, son Guy, and her entire family we extend our heartfelt condolences. She was an inspiration to us all, and her loss is deeply felt. Bruce A. Stevens, President Peter B. Goodrich, V.P., Worldwide Concert and Artist Activities
