        STARK--Howard E. Cleveland native, a pioneer in television broadcasting, passed away March 12, 2007, at age 92, in New York City. He is survived by brothers Sol (Doris) of West Palm Beach, FL, and Cleveland, Mort (Mae, deceased) and Al (Joyce); and sister, Marilyn Micohn (Al), all of Cleveland; and numerous nieces and nephews throughout the country. He was preceded in death by a sister, Gertrude Rosenstein (Ben, deceased). Following graduation from John Adams High School, Stark left Cleveland, eventually settling in New York City. Stark is credited with single-handedly creating what is now the multi-billion dollar television and radio station brokerage industry; unheard of and unimagined until envisioned by Stark in the 1950's. Over his 50 year career, he was instrumental in virtually every strategic ownership transaction in the industry. Stark was called upon to broker the transaction that created WNET, the nation's first public television station in 1962. Never working with any more than a personal assistant, his client list spanned a generation of media giants including the Walt Disney Company, RKO, Metromedia, Knight Ridder, Viacom, Taft Broadcasting, Allbrittion Communications, Gannett, The Tribune Company and dozens more. In the 1970's when Wall Street began competing, Broadcast & Cable Magazine listed Stark as having closed over $1 billion in transaction in a single year, more than all of the combined Wall Street media transactions. Howard Stark lived in NY and did business throughout the United States and Europe. He was a world traveler and sophisticated business executive, yet privately he was a modest man, a fine tennis player and raconteur. Howard Stark was devoted to his extended family in both NY and Cleveland. He was a remarkable man who led a remarkable life. Known to all as simply, ''Howard'', his generosity and modesty was only exceeded by his style and wit. He will be deeply missed. Funeral services were private.
