        HERLING-Erwin. Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem mourns the loss of an extraordinary man whose selflessness and kind heart helped to write a new and glorious chapter in the history of ''The Hospital With A Heart''. A Holocaust victim, he helped to build and strengthen vital institutions on the memory of the ashes, that would rebuild the Jewish nation's body and soul. Today, Shaare Zedek's Herling Building rises above the skyline as a beacon of hope to the thousands of patients who are cared for with ultramodern care, compassion and dignity. His overwhelming generosity will benefit the people of Israel for generations to come. Sincerest condolences to his beloved wife, Tova.
