        LEVINE-Leona. The American Committee for the Weizmann Institute of Science notes with deep sorrow the passing of a cherished long-time friend. She shared the passion and vision of her late husband Harry Levine, one of the founding fathers of the Weizmann Institute and its American Committee. Among the many endeavors they sponsored at Weizmann were the Levine Institute of Applied Science and the Levine Chair of Neurosciences. Their devotion to the Weizmann Institute is an inspiration to us all. We extend heartfelt condolences to the entire Levine family. Gershon Kekst, Chairman Weizmann Institute of Science Haim Harari, President S. Donald Sussman, Chairman American Committee Robert G. Begam, President Fran Ginsburg, Exec Director Bernard N. Samers, Exec VP Emeritus
