        ECCLES--Mary, Viscountess. The Trustees, Fellows, and staff of The Pierpont Morgan Library mourn the death of Mary Eccles, widow of the 1st Viscount Eccles. In 1949 she became a founding Fellow of the Library, and in 1966 she joined the Board of Trustees, serving as a valuable member for 37 years. She was an accomplished scholar of English literature and a distinguished book collector, especially of Samuel Johnson and Oscar Wilde. Passionate in her support of the Library and its collections, she was also a generous and beloved patron. We will greatly miss her and extend our heartfelt sympathy to her family and friends. S. Parker Gilbert, President Charles E. Pierce, Jr., Dir.
