        ZEVON-Renee S. On March 25, 1998, age 50. With profound sadness, we mark the passing of our beloved and compassionate friend and mentor. Renee touched us for too short a time, but ever so deeply, with her senses of humanity and of humor and with her zest for life. She was the great communicator and we will miss her terribly. Our greatest love and deepest sympathy to Richard, Elizabeth, Amanda and Michael. Stephanie Mudick David Gottlieb
