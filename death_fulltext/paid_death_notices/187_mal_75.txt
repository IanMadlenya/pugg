        GORMLEY-Frank J. On August 5, 2002, retired from Citibank and Siemens, served aboard The USS Bennington. Dearest and truest friend, a sweet and lively companion, courageous and passionate about life & love, an adoring and forever adored husband. Frank loved the sea and ships, music, especially jazz, good food-especially mine, films and books about history and intrigue. Above all, he loved to talk and exchange ideas. As his illness robbed him of one and yet another of these earthly pleasures, he continued to accommodate each loss without complaint or bitterness. He remained independent and each day went through exhausting health rituals just to stay alive. Survived by his wife and soul mate, his caring and loving mother-in-law, Jennie Sini, and sisters-in-law, Evelyn and Yolanda Sini, and Peggy Gormley (widow of dear deceased brother, Jack), nieces, Betty and Kathleen, and nephew, John. My deepest gratitude to the entire Medical Staff at Victory Memorial. I could not ask for more or better. Thank you for touching me and Frank so gently. Visiting on Wednesday and Thursday, August 7th and 8th, 2-4 and 7-9 P.M. at Clavin Funeral Home, 7722 Fourth Avenue, Brklyn. Mass of Christian Burial Friday August 9 at 10 A.M. Saint Anselm's Church, 82nd Street & Fourth Avenue, Brooklyn. Thank you with love from Frank and Eileen.
