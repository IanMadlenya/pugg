        O'NEIL-Thomas F. It is with profound sorrow that the Officers, Board, and members of United Cerebral Palsy of New York City note the passing of Thomas F. O'Neil, former Chairman of RKO General. Tom was a staunch supporter of people with cerebral palsy and related disabilities over many, many years. Through his efforts RKO sponsored UCP's annual telethon broadcasts over its New York station WWOR-TV (Channel 9). For this and for his many other generous contributions, he was awarded UCP's Humanitarian Award in 1984. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Claire and all the family. Leo Hausman, President Jack Hausman, Founder UCP of NYC, Inc.
        O'NEIL-Thomas F. Tom was a good friend to me and a special supporter of United Cerebral Palsy. He is already missed by those who knew him. Jack Hausman
