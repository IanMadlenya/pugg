        COHEN--Fannie. A woman of valor. Devoted wife of the late Samuel Cohen. Beloved mother of Hanna and Julian, grandmother of Jeremy, Ava, Ali, and Julia, greatgrandmother of Sam and Billy. Loving mother-in-law of Pat and Jeffrey, grandmother-in-law of Kirsten, Bogart, Peter, and Darren. Born in Vishnevetz, Ukraine, in 1907, she made a new life in New York, the city she loved and never left. Family was everything to her, but she had countless friends and made them family too. Her proud spirit, wicked humor, and enormous curiosity about the world will live on in all who knew her. Funeral services at Plaza Jewish Community Chapel, Tuesday, at 11 am. No flowers, please: donations to American Jewish World Service gratefully received. Always in our hearts, wherever she may be.
