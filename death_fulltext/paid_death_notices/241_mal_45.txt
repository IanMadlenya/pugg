        JOYCE--George Robert McClellan, Huntington Beach, CA, died peacefully on January 20, 2007, with daughters Maggie Joyce Bailly (Mrs. Jeffrey Bailly) of Newburyport, MA and Brigid Joyce Harris (Mrs. Jeffrey Harris) of San Rafael, CA at his side, and daughters Andree Joyce Gordon (Mrs. John Gordon) of Lebanon, NJ and Lonnie Joyce of Phoenix, AZ in his heart. Bud will be missed by his four grandchildren, Megan Bailly, Richard Bailly, Thomas Bailly and Emmy Gordon and his dear cousins, Barbara Traphagen of Vero Beach, FL and East Hampton, NY and Winslow Tuttle of Greenwich, CT. He attended Columbia and the NY Institute of Finance, and served as the President of Flamemaster Corp. for 20 years before retiring to pursue other interests. Born in 1931 on the 4th of July, he will always be our Yankee Doodle Dandy. His spirit and his wit soothe our mourning souls. A memorial mass will be held in East Hampton in June.
