        FERBER-Russell. The staff, past and present, of the Village Community School extends its heartfelt sympathy to David, Dorothy and Jordon on the tragic and untimely passing of their son and brother and our beloved alumnus Russell. His spirit was larger than life and will continue to fill the hearts, the halls, and the basketball courts of VCS. He will be deeply missed. Eve Kleger, Director
