        WHITE-John F., Jr. The Board of Directors, Administration, Medical and Dental Staff of Brookhaven Memorial Hospital Medical Center express their profound sorrow on the death of John F. White, Jr., former President of the Board of Directors and Founding Board Member of the Medical Center. Mr. White served the Medical Center in its formative years as Secretary of the Board of Directors and from 1963 to 1968 held the office of President. In 1990 he was elected Director Emeritus. His vision and wise counsel commanded our highest respect and his continued dedication to the health of our community resulted in the prestigious ''TR'' award from the Nassau/Suffolk Hospital Council in 1968. His leadership and devotion set an example for us all to follow. We extend our deepest sympathy to his entire family. Fredric Rose, Chairman, Board of Directors Gopal A. Bhandarkar, MD, President, Medical and Dental Staff Thomas Ockers, President and CEO
