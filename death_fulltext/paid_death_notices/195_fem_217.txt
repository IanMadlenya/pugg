        NEWHOUSE-Caroline. Artists, Board, and staff of The Parsons Dance Company extend deepest sympathy to the family and friends of Caroline Newhouse, a continuous inspiration and motivating force for all of us. Dearest Caroline was always there for us with her wit, support and energy, and we will deeply miss her shining presence and her example of how to live life beautifully and generously.
