        BERMAN-Henry. 95, left us March 11, 2001. He arrived at 7, on Ellis, from London, then to New Bethlehem, PA, Persia, The Arctic, and finally New York, meeting his life love, Tuni. His gaze often shifted to the invisible. From the first crystal radios, tapping the ether, to Carl Zeiss microscopy, and the continent contained on a glass slide. Finally, to the blues and stripers, under the Fire Island surf, into which he will soon return. Those he touched include, Harry, Sarah, Ben, Boobie, Sissy, Fran, Carl, Bernice, Susan, Harry, Buff, Milton, Cole Porter, David Smith, and Dorothy Dahner, and his loving family, Zeke, Laura, and Lilly.
