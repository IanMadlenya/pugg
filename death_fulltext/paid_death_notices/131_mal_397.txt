        DILWORTH-J. Richardson. The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art deeply mourn the passing of our beloved former Chairman, J. Richardson Dilworth, one of the Institution's most devoted and valued leaders. His more than three decades of exemplary and devoted serviceas longtime Trustee and Trustee Emeritus, Vice President, Vice Chairman, and Chairman of the Board-were marked by wisdom, judgement, and generosity. A Fellow for Life since 1961, he was elected as Benefactor in 1980, and served as Chairman from 1983 to 1987, presiding over an era of major growth in Museum programs, building, collections, and attendance. A guiding light and an indomitable force, he will be deeply missed. Arthur Ochs Sulzburger, Chairman William H. Luers, President Philippe de Montebello, Director
