        QUINN-Kevin. It is with deepest sadness that we share the news of the passing of Kevin Quinn, Lower Eastside Center's Senior Vice President. Kevin died at Calvary Hospital on October 30, from kidney cancer. Kevin will long be remembered for his 27 years of utmost dedication to LESC. Kevin first joined LESC in 1973, as a vocational supervisor. In 1974, he was promoted to Administrator of Residential and Day Treatment at Su Casa. In 1978, he was promoted to Administrator of LESC and subsequently Senior Vice President. In his final years, Kevin oversaw the Su Casa renovations and while his involvement was increasingly peripheral, he considered his limited participation a welcome distraction from his illness. He often expressed a wish to see the renovation through to completion, but, in time, recognized that his dream would not be realized. In loving memory of Kevin and his deeplyfelt commitment to this project, at Su Casa's grand reopening ceremony, LESC plans to name the newly renovated facility ''The Kevin Quinn Building'' In this way, he will remain an integral part of Su Casa's history and future. His love and devotion to his family and the joy and light he brought to all who knew and worked with him will be deeply missed and remembered always. Visitation: Thursday,, November 2 from 7-9PM and Friday, November 3 from 2-4PM at Higgins Funeral Home. Funeral Services Saturday, November 4 at St. Gregory's Church at 9:A.M. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Stony Point Volunteer Ambulance at 6 Lee Avenue, Stony Point, New York 10980.
