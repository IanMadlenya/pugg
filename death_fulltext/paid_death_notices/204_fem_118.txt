        SEAGLE--Janet M. Of Mendham, NJ, Golf historian, lecturer, and Curator and Librarian of the Museum and Archives of the United States Golf Association in Far Hills, N.J. We lost our beloved aunt December 25, 2003. She was born in Spokane, WA and grew up in the East. She attended Ohio Wesleyan University and earned a degree in Art from New York University. Before joining the USGA in 1963, she was a professional photographer. She doubled as art director for the Golf Journal until 1985. In 1989, she retired as the USGA's Curator and Librarian with continued duties as a consultant. A dedicated golfer, she played in three USGA Senior Women's Amateur Championships. She was an active Christian Scientist and a member of the Mother Church in Boston. She wintered in Riverbend in Tequesta, FL., where she won the Riverbend Women's Amateur Championship in 2003. She was a board member of the Riverbend Golf Association, a member of Somerset Hills C.C., gardened at the Cross Estate Gardens and supported The Edna Hibel Society, The Smithsonian and The Royal Oak Foundation. She was a fervent supporter of the arts. Her favorite saying was, ''Age is only a number and mine is unlisted.'' To know her was to know a well-traveled, interesting and learned woman. She is survived by her niece Karen Mead of Largo, FL., nephews Bill Caryl Jr. of Waterford, M.I. and David Caryl of Rochster, NY; and six grandnieces and grandnephews. We will be celebrate her life January 24 at 1 P.M. in a memorial service at Golf House, the USGA headquarters in Far Hills, N.J. Memorial donations may be made to the New Jersey Historical Garden Foundation, P.O. Box 712, Bernardsville, N.J. 07924, or The United States Golf Assocation, P.O. Box 708, Far Hills, N.J. 07931-0708.
