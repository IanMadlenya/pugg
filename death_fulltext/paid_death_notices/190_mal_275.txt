        MARKS-Stanley. Boys Town Jerusalem records with sorrow the passing of a cherished member of its extended family. Stanley's dedicated efforts on numerous fronts enabled the school to fulfill its mission of turning young boys from limited backgrounds into young men with limitless futures. He organized an inaugural New Jersey gathering which would evolve into the all important Bergen County Friends of Boys Town. In Florida, he sponsored and hosted events which strengthened the Florida Friends of Boys Town. Stanley shared his professional expertise in helping the school maintain state of the art printing and graphic arts facilities when its vocational track featured these programs. Together with his beloved Evelyn, his partner in life and charity, he was a Chai Founder and dedicated a major scholarship endowment. As a Board Member and member of the Executive Committee, his wise counsel will be missed. Most of all, we mourn the loss of a valued friend. Sincere condolences to the entire family. Rabbi Moshe Linchner, Dean Michael J. Scharf, President Josh S. Weston, Honorary Chairman Raphael Benaroya, Chairman Rabbi Ronald Gray, Executive Vice President
