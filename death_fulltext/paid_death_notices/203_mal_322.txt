        SWEDER--William, DDS. A special man-the enbodiment of brilliance, kindness, warmth, sensitivity and sincerity. We, who called him Uncle Bill, are devastated that his wonderful wife, Aunt Edna, is currently without her soulmate of more than sixty years. That his children, grandchildren, and greatgrandchildren, will keep his memory alive, is testimony to the kind of man he was on earth. Uncle Bill, you will be in our hearts forever. Much love, Bunny and Charles, Amy and Brian, Stacy and David, Jennifer and Keith
