        BERMAN-Edith. November 10, 1998. A woman of surpassing qualities: extraordinarily devoted wife, exemplary mother, patient, adoring grandmother, loyal, unwavering, and generous in her love for those dear to her. In her gracious, lovely, and endlessly unassuming way, she occupied a place in our hearts so outsized, so far beyond the roles of sister-in-law and aunt. We will miss her ready laughter, her quick wit, her gifted brilliant mind. The joy and contentment she found in everyday life set a standard to strive for. Her loss is devastating to our family. Nothing will be the same without her, but she will live on forever in our hearts. Marlene, Richard, Jamie, Kerry, Kenneth, and Julie Grau, Neil, Carolyn, Marla, Adam, and Jennifer Berman
