        MICHAEL - Catherine Barbara Whitten. The Brooklyn Hospital Center expresses deepest sympathy to the family of Catherine Michael who for seven years directed our Department of Nursing with great warmth and professionalism. A fellow of Wharton School, Catherine was an accomplished nurse, writer, lecturer and speaker, who rose to a position of prominence in her chosen profession, having served on numerous national, regional and city-wide healthcare and nurisng policy committees. Despite her busy and demanding professional and personal life, she always kept an open door to all members of her staff and gained respect through her warmth and friendliness towards all. We will greatly miss her. Seth S. Faison Chairman, Board of Trustees Frederick D. Alley President and CEO The Brooklyn Hospital Center
