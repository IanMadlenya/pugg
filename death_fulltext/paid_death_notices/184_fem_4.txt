        SILVERMAN-Annie Bronstein. The Metropolitan Montessori School community is deeply saddened by the loss of Annie Bronstein Silverman. Annie will be remembered for her wonderful smile, generous heart and her immense capacity to love. Our sympathies to her husband, Larry; her son, Micky; and all other members of the family that was so important to her.
