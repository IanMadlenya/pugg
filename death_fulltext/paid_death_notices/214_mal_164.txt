        LOEB--Peter. The Board and staff of New York City Center deeply mourn the passing of our devoted Board member, Peter Loeb. For eleven years, he served on City Center's Board of Directors and generously gave his time, wisdom and support in so many ways. He was passionate about young people, and as Chairman of our Education Committee, worked tirelessly to help insure that New York City school children experienced the arts firsthand. We will miss him deeply--his enthusiasm, his counsel and caring nature. We send our deepest condolences to Jeanette, his children and their entire family. Raymond A. Lomontagne, Chairman Arlene Shuler, Pres. & CEO
