        COLM--Werner E. We mourn the loss of a dear and special friend whose outstretched hand of kindness helped to heal so many. A man of quiet modesty, his life experiences made him understand the true significance of the State of Israel and the importance of providing its people with the utmost in medical care. May the family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. American Committee for Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem
