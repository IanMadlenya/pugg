        MOSKOWITZ-Morris. Age 91, passed away on November 29. ''Whitey,'' ''Buddy''. Devoted husband and father, extraordinary grandfather and great-grandfather. A self educated man, he was the founder of the industry leading, eponymous maker of fine leather handbags and accessories. A man committed to those around him and possessed of a tremendous heart and spirit. A fiercely proud man who took the greatest pride in the accomplishments of his family. Generous to all, he never ceased giving of himself for the betterment of his family and those close to him. Morris was a man whose religious bearing helped guide him in his life's pursuits. The second of five children, Whitey grew up on the Lower East Side during the Depression and was forever committed to a life free of need for his family and friends alike. He is survived by Adeline, his wife of 63 years, Judy and Alan Benjamin, his daughter and sonin-law, Sheri and Dean and Gabrielle Benjamin, his grandchildren and granddaughter-in-law, Jeremy and Caroline Benjamin, his greatgrandchildren, his brother Jerry and sister Molly. Donations may be made to the Jewish Guild for the Blind, 15 West 65 St, NY, NY 10023.
