        LUDGIN--Chester. New York City Opera deeply mourns the passing of Chester Ludgin, leading baritone with our company from his debut in 1957 as Dr. Falke in ''Die Fledermaus'' until his 1991 engagement as Tony in ''The Most Happy Fella''. He sang all the leading Verdi and Puccini roles here, but is perhaps best remembered as a passionate advocate of new American opera, creating leading roles in NYCO world premieres including ''The Crucible'', ''The Golem'', and ''The Good Soldier Schweik''. Though his busy career also took him to the opera companies of San Francisco, Houston, Boston, Vienna, La Scala, and Rome, as well as numerous orchestras and musical theatre stages, we are proud that NYCO was always his artistic home. His unforgettable voice, powerful stage presence, unfailing collegiality, and infectious joie de vivre endeared him to all of us. We have lost a great artist and a great friend, and we will miss him. Contributions in his name can be made to Opera New York, 205 West End Avenue, NY, NY 10023, earmarked for the Chester Ludgin Memorial Fund. Paul Kellogg General Director
