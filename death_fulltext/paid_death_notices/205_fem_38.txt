        STANKARD--Catherine A. It is with deepest sympathy and our fondest memories that we mark the passing of our beloved Catherine ''Kitty'' Stankard. Her 45 years of devoted service to the members of the Lawrence Beach Club will remain in the hearts and minds of all who knew her. She was a true lady in every sense of the word and an inspiration for all who will follow. We will miss her dearly. With love, Her Family of Friends at The Lawrence Beach Club.
