        MANUGUERRA-Matteo. Opera Orchestra of New York mourns the death of this great baritone. He sang seven operas with OONY: L'Africana, Francesca di Rimini, I Masnadieri, Lucrezia Borgia, Il Duca d'Alba, La Battaglia di Legnano, and La Wally. He was always a joyful colleague. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his wife, Michelle, and their children. Eve Queler, Music Director
