        KLEIBER--Carlos. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of Maestro Carlos Kleiber. His association with the company led to a series of brilliant performances acclaimed by audiences and critics alike. Following his debut in 1988 leading an historic cast in ''La Boheme,'' he conducted 18 memorable performances of ''La Traviata,'' ''Otello,'' and finally a sweeping ''Der Rosenkavalier,'' his last performances in our house in 1990. A master musician of powerful intellect and impassioned originality, he will be greatly missed. We extend our sincere condolences to his family and friends.
