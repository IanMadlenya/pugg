        MUSS-Ruth. The Yeshiva University family and its affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS) mourn the passing of a deeply cherished friend, a kind, gentle, and lovely grand lady who, together with her late, beloved husband, Rabbi Hyman Muss, a member of the RIETS Board, was a Benefactor of Yeshiva University. Recipient of an honorary degree from YU in 1996, she recently established, together with her children, The Rabbi Hyman Muss Torah Learning Center and Beit Midrash in the Ruth and Hyman Muss Residence Hall, which she and her husband and children established many years ago at the Wilf Campus in Washington Heights. She was the founding President of the Queens Chapter of the Yeshiva University Women's Organization, and has played an active role in YUWO over the years. Our heartfelt condolences are extended to her children, who follow in the legacy of their parents as Yeshiva University Benefactors in thier own right: Toby and Stanley Muss; Harriet (a member of the YUWO Presidium) and Joshua Muss, (a member of the Yeshiva College Board of Directors); grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Robert M. Beren, Chairman YU Board of Trustees Julius Berman, Chairman RIETS Board of Trustees Jay Schottenstein, Chairman Yeshiva College Board of Directors Dinah Pinczower, National Chairman of the Board YUWO
