        HARIRI--Rafic. The Trustees of the American University of Beirut are shocked and saddened by the news of the calamity that has befallen Lebanon and the world in the loss of Rafic Hariri, our fellow Trustee. Not only was he one of the great leaders in the Middle East, but he was also admired and respected in all the capitals of the world, across the political spectrum. This is a great tragedy for Lebanon. It is also a great tragedy for AUB, which has lost a most esteemed and inspirational trustee of long standing over many years, as well as a philanthropist whose generosity has supported so many students and so many programs of the University. We have been grateful to have him as a colleague, and we shall miss him sorely. Richard A. Debs, Chairman John Waterbury, President American University of Beirut
