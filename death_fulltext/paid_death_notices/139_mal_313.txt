        WILDERS-Reverend Monsignor James Gabriel. The people, clergy and staff of St. Thomas More parish on East 89th St. express sorrow at the death of our former Pastor, who entered into Eternal Life on August 25, 1998. He was a faithful friend and father to all. May he rest in the peace of Christ.
