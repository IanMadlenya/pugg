        SEIDNER-David. The Board, Staff and Volunteers of the Community Research Initiative on AIDS (CRIA) mourn the passing of our friend, advocate and Board Member, David Seidner. One of the earliest champions of CRIA's efforts to find new AIDS treatments, David's innate scientific curiosity and strong sense of urgency could always be counted on to make critical contributions to our research program. He lent both his time, talent, and boundless creativity to numerous CRIA fundraising efforts. David's keen eye for perfection, forthright honesty and zeal for living will be sorely missed in our lives and in our work. Ross Bleckner, President J Daniel Stricker, Exec. Dir.
