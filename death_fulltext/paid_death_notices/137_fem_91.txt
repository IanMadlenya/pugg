        LUNAU-Elizabeth, 87. Beloved mother of Dominique Avery and grandmother of Carola Morrone of Simsbury, CT, died June 5 at her home in Manhattan. She was the daughter of Ludwig Marum, a minister in the Weimar government who was taken prisoner by the Nazis in 1933 and killed a year later. Elizabeth passed her exams to become a lawyer three days before Hitler's government barred Jews from practicing law. She fled Germany in 1936 and joined her mother, sister and brother in France, where they were put in concentration camps. Her sister died in a camp in Poland. Elizabeth was eventually released and made her way to New York in 1941. She supported herself and her daughter by working as a maid, eventually becoming executive housekeeper at a number of Manhattan hotels. To keep the memory of her family alive, Elizabeth published two books in German, a collection of her father's writings and one of her relatives' letters during World War II, which was also published in French. She travelled to Germany frequently to speak to young people about the Holocaust. A Memorial service will be held Sunday at 11 A.M. at Gannon Funeral Home, 152 East 28th Street. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made in her name to the Leo Baeck Institute, 129 East 73rd Street, New York, New York 10021.
