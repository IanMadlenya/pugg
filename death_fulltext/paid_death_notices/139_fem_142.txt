        FIDALGO-Norma. 1/1/46-8/2/98. In memory of a fleeting shimmer in the pages of Harper's Bazaar and Vogue, as transient as the clouds and for the term of her days, a talented and compassionate woman, has passed away. The understanding of beauty was her sensitive emotional choice, goodness was her gift. Norma is, was and isn't anymore, and will never be again. We hold her lovingly in our hearts. Dora Fidalgo, Linda de Frances Otto Stupakoff
