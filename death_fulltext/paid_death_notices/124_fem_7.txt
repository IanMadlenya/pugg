        SILVER-Sally (nee Sarah Gany), on April 29th from a weak heart despite a tenacious will. Born on April 14, 1918, she lived until the end ''at age 27'' in Riverdale, and is survived by many siblings, a loving husband of fifty-six years Al Silver, children Victor Silver and Sharon Silver-Regent, grandchildren Stacey Simensky, Nicole Regent, and Rebecca Silver, and great-grandchildren Amanda and Jamie Simensky. All will dearly miss her quirky charm, straightforwardness, baked sweets, and lemon soup. In lieu of flowers send contributions to American Heart Association.
