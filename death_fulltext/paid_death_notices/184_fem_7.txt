The Jewish Museum notes with much sadness the passing of Lenore Klein, a devoted and long-standing volunteer who, together with her beloved late husband Howard, was a generous donor and ardent supporter of our exhibitions. She will be missed by staff and volunteers alike. Joan Rosenbaum, Helen Goldsmith Menschel Director
