        BATSCHA-Robert M. On July 4, 2003. The Board of Trustees and the staff of The Museum of Television & Radio in both New York and Los Angeles mourn the untimely passing of our beloved President. His commitment and unwavering belief in the Museum and its mission were instrumental in securing the Museum's reputation as a leading cultural institution. His dedication, vision, determination, and unfaltering leadership guided and inspired us for more than 20 years. The loss to the Museum is immeasurable, and he will be sorely missed and long remembered by everyone who knew and admired him. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his son Eric and the rest of his family. Services are private. A memorial service will be held at a later date. Frank A. Bennack, Jr., Chairman of the Board of Trustees
