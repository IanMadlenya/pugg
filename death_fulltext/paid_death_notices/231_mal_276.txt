        SABBAH--Maurice ''Chico''. Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, expresses its deepest sorrow at the passing of a devoted friend and visionary leader of the Jewish people. Cherished husband of Zmira, beloved father of Leeor and Ronee, brother of Joyce, and uncle of Glenn and Gary Drew, his legacy will live on through his commitment to Jewish education and his generosity to the Jewish people in the U.S. and Israel. He will be sorely missed by the community of students whose lives he touched and by all who knew him. We extend our most heartfelt condolences to his loved ones. May his memory be for a blessing, and may the family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. June Walker, National President Morlie Levin, National Executive Director
