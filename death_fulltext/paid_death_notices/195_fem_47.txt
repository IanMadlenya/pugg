        DUNCAN - Barbara Doyle. The International Council of The Museum of Modern Art expresses great sadness upon learning of the passing of Barbara Duncan. A member of the Council since 1964, Barbara was a passionate advocate of the art of Latin America. She was a key part of our Program Committee and Latin American subcommittee for many years. An avid traveler and devoted friend, Barbara will be deeply missed. Our most sincere sympathies are extended to her husband John and children Gale, Craig and Lynn. Sir Brian Urquhart, Chairman Emeritus Agnes Gund, Chairman Jo Carole Lauder, President The International Council of The Museum of Modern Art
