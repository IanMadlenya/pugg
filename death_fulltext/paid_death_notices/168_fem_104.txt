At the age of seven she was sent from relative to relative between Ohio and New York due to the death of her mother. In New York she learned the attributes that took her through life, her independence, self-determination, and, most of all, her strength. As a teenager she lived with her older brother and his wife in Manhattan, moving from apartment to apartment when the rent was due. She met and married her husband, Peter Ferrara, a good-looking young Brooklyn man. After many years of marriage, Peter died, July, 1969. For the past 31 years, Sunnie once again displayed her strength and endurance living life to the fullest in her new home in Pompano Beach, Florida. She reigned over her family with the utmost love and respect. She is survived by her children, Adeline (Addie), Carole, Alex and Jo (Josephine), her grandchildren, Nycole and Jodi and her cherished great grandson, Gavin; her brother, Anthony and Frank Castle; her sister, Rose Mac Sems.
