        STRAX-Dr. Philip. He was far more than a physician. He was far more than a medical pioneer. He was also a loving uncle always there to guide us, to inspire us, to cheer us, and to stand at our sides in moments of both happiness and sadness. He was as gentle as any, but also as strong as necessary in teaching us, his family, the blessings of life and the continuing need to do for others what they could not do for themselves. He taught us humanity and also inspired all of us with his professional dedication to his patients. He will live in our memory and in our hearts forever. He will always be with us, smiling upon us, and we shall remember him forever. We will always love you, Uncle Phil Richard, Julie & Daniel Goldstein London
