        STOLLMAN-Phillip. The Yeshiva University family mourns the passing of a longtime friend who, with his late brother Max and late sister-in-law Frieda, was a YU Guardian and a Founder of our Albert Einstein College of Medicine. We extend our heartfelt condolences to son Dr. Gerald (and Leila) Stollman and daughters Shirley, Annette, and Rochelle; grandchildren; great-grandchildren; and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University David S. Gottesman, Chairman Board of Trustees
