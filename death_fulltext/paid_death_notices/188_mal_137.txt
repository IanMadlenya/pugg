        ABRAHAM-Alexander. The President, Board of Trustees, staff, and extended family of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute mourn the passing on August 25 of our esteemed friend, colleague, and benefactor, Alexander Abraham. Mr. Abraham's ardent belief in the possibility of progress in childhood cancer research being conducted at DanaFarber inspired his fellow trustees. His generosity was instrumental in advancing our mission to lead the way in researching, treating, and preventing cancer. The Institute will be forever grateful to Mr. Abraham for his foresight and generosity in establishing the David Abraham Clinical Investigators Program and the David Abraham Fellowship Fund. We extend our deepest sympathies to his family and friends. Edward J. Benz, Jr., M.D. President, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
