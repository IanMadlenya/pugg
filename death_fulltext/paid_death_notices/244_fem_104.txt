        WHITE--Carla. Died peacefully at home in NYC, May 9, 2007. Ms. White devoted her life to artistic exploration and growth as a jazz singer. She was born in Oakland, CA and raised in Bellport, NY. Completing two years at London's prestigious Webber-Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art, Ms. White returned to New York City, embarking upon a 30-year career for which she garnered critical praise: ''One of the most impressive performers to come along in years...an unusually accomplished interpreter,'' Howard Reich, Chicago Tribune; ''A singer who blends interpretive intelligence with a solid musical grounding and a sure sense of swing,'' Don Heckman, Los Angeles Times. Career highlights include New York's Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall, Town Hall and the Texaco Jazz Festival; The Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.; the Ottawa International Jazz Festival; the Chattanooga Riverbend Festival; and the Mellon Jazz Festival in Philadelphia. Success is playing with the musicians I love to play with in situations where the audience is receptive and appreciative,'' Ms. White said. She is survived by her mother, Mrs. Frederick Ayer of Seattle, WA, and three stepbrothers, James, Anthony, and Frederick Ayer and her partner Anne Stamper. Ms. White was predeceased by her father, brother and sister, Penny and Miles White. A memorial celebration will be held June 8, 2007 at St. Peters Church 619 Lexington Avenue at E. 54th St. NYC at 5:00pm. In lieu of flowers donations can be made to the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation and the Jazz Foundation of America.
