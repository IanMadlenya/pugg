        KLASFELD -- David. His friends and colleagues mourn the sudden death of a loyal, honorable and beloved friend and send their condolences to his wife Hila, his daughter Rebecca and mother Pauline. A long career in public service gave Klasfeld a ready outlet for his love and committement to New York City. At the behest of Chancellor Harold O. Levy, Klasfeld served as Deputy Chancellor of the New York City School System, directing the schools' post-September 11th recovery efforts and reforming the Public Schools' Athletic League. As Counsel and then as Chief of Staff during the Koch, Dinkins and Giuliani Administrations, Klasfeld was involved in the revitalization of Times Sqaure, the renewal of Lower Manhattan and the creation of the Hudson River Park. Klasfeld also practiced at Skadden, Arps, Meagher and Flom, where he served as plaintiffs' counsel in the United States District Court case McLean v. Arkansas, which found that creation science was not science and could not be taught as a competing theory with evolution.
