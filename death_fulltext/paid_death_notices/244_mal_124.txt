        STRAUSS--Lawrence M.D., died on May 10th. He is survived by his beloved companion Esther Schwinger, children Leslie Strauss of Sausalito, CA and Bob Strauss and grandchildren Jillian and Kelsey Blakkan-Strauss of Muskegon, MI, sister and brother-in-law Bobbie and Judge Simons of Florida, sister-in-law and brother-in-law Wilfred and Sandra Calmas of Chestnut Hills, MA and nephews Larry and Cary Simons, Richard, James, and Steven Calmas and nieces Mona and Randy Simons. He was the loving husband of Myrna who died in 1995 after 50 years of marriage. Larry celebrated life with unmatched enthusiasm as a caring healer, mentor, devoted husband, beloved companion and nurturing father, grandfather, brother and uncle. Following graduation from Columbia University, where he also excelled at multiple varsity sports, he graduated from Medical School in Massachusetts, and then went on to become one of the founding fathers of North Shore Community Hospital and a much respected and loved personal physician in family practice in Great Neck, NY. Following his retirement he continued his education at CW Post, Long Island University, with active involvement in the Hutton House Lectures, where he was an advisory board member emeritus. As a poet extraordinaire and tireless pursuer of knowledge, his joie-devivre was matched by his all consuming kindness, generosity, and compassion for family, friends and patients. He was truly a man for all seasons.
