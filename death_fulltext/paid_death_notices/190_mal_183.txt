        COHEN-Shragai. The Officers and Staff of State of Israel Bonds mourn with profound sorrow the passing of a passionate champion of Israel who served with great ability and tireless devotion as a senior member of its professional staff from the organization's founding 51 years ago. Shragai was a leader of the religious Zionist movement who dedicated his life to building Israel as a haven and homeland for the Jewish people. Throughout his Israel Bonds career, he spearheaded numerous campaigns to strengthen Israel's economy and was an invaluable liaison with every Israeli Prime Minister and major political leader. He created and was the driving force behind the International Elie Wiesel Holocaust Remembrance Dinner, which has raised hundreds of millions of dollars over the last 18 years among Holocaust survivors and their children. All his friends at Israel Bonds extend sincere condolences to his wife Hannah, daughter Rochelle, and sons Dov and Hillel. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.

        COHEN-Shragai. Small in stature, but a giant modern day Patriarch of the Jewish People. Shragai was driven by his passionate commitment to Eretz Yisrael, Am Yisrael and Torat Yisrael. He was a role model par excellence who taught by example. Shragai's legacy will endure as a lasting inspiration. May his dear family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Rabbi Moshe Linchner, Dean Josh S. Weston, Honorary Chairman Raphael Benaroya, Chairman Michael J. Scharf, President Rabbi Ronald L. Gray, Exec. V.P.
