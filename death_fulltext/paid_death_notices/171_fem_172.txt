        KLEINER-Rose. The Board of Trustees, President David C. Chang and other members of the Polytechnic University family express heartfelt sorrow and join in mourning the passing of Rose Kleiner, beloved wife of Trustee Eugene Kleiner, founding partner of Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers. Mrs. Kleiner was a gracious supporter of the University and held a deep affection for its students and mission. An immigrant, she had an unwavering sense of compassion, a special loyalty to her new homeland and, through her generous philanthropy, a genuine and sustained commitment to helping those less fortunate than she. We extend our condolences and profound sympathy to the entire family upon its loss.
