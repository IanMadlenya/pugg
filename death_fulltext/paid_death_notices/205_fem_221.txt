        ROSENFELD--Juanita. Died February 17th, at peace and at home in Los Angeles, surrounded by family. Survived by John, her loving husband of 60 years, her daughter Susan and son Gus. Also surviving: vast areas of recreational open space remaining within our treasured Santa Monica Mountains, much the result of her over 40 years of voluntary and undaunted service to the local and statewide community. At one time, a resident of Middletown, CT, and, seasonally, Weston, VT. In lieu of flowers, she had requested donations in her name to the League of Conservation Voters. A Memorial Service will be announced and is to take place in the early Spring. Nita will be dearly missed as a wife, mother, an ever energetic activist and friend to many.
