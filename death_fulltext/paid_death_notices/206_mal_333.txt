        SADIN--Sam. Sam was our mother's cousin but undertook after we lost our parents to fill the role of father, mentor, advisor and especially friend to all of us. He and Terry made their home our home and made our wives and our children part of their close family. They were there to celebrate with, to share in our joys and our sorrows, to applaud our successes and to comfort us at times of loss. Sam was a constant presence in our adult lives, available whenever we needed him--the best listener, the most understanding and perceptive of men. Even in his waning days we saw flashes of his great wit and incisive intelligence. He led the fullest of lives, a man of great passion for social justice, of great appreciation for poetry and art and music, of deep love for friends and family. He inspired all of us and in memory will continue to do so. Michael, Jesse, & Ed Levine
