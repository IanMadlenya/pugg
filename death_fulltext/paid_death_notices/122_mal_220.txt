        SAUDEK-Robert. The Musicians, Trustees and Staff of the Marlboro Music School and Festival extend their deepest sympathy to the family of Robert Saudek, who served as a valued member of the Board of Trustees since 1968. We celebrate his lifelong love of music and his wonderfully creative use of television for the arts. His gentle but innovative spirit brought to Marlboro an enthusiastic advocate and friend whom we will all miss. Stephen Stamas, Chairman Board of Trustees Marlboro Music School & Festival
