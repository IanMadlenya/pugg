        CROCKET-Philip. With reverence and respect, we mourn the passing of Philip Crocket, a former commander in the American Navy stationed in England during WWII, a Rhodes Scholar, former Wall Street broker, the second husband of the late Ruth Dill Johnson who was the former wife of the late Seward Johnson. Mr. and Mrs. Crocket were married for 50 years before she passed away at the age of 84. Philip Crocket was born Memorial Day, 1898, and died July 4th, 2001, at the age of 103, at the Parker Nursing Home which was built on land donated by Ruth Dill Johnson Crocket and where Mr. Crocket lived until 1999, when he himself moved into the Parker Home. He leaves behind three step-children and their families.
