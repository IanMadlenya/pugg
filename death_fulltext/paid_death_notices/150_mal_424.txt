        GINSBURG-Martin. Abe Ginsburg, his wife Sylvia and their children Bernice and Marvin, Howard and Randi, and Jaclyn and David sadly mourn the loss of their beloved brother and uncle Martin. He will always be remembered for his gentle, caring personality and utmost devotion to his wife, family and friends. Martin was a sensitive and creative individual gifted in painting, sculpting and music. He was very philanthropic and a major contributor to schools and youth centers in Israel as well as other charities such as the Mount Sinai Hospital in Miami Beach, the Byalstoker Home For The Aged in New York, Technion in Israel and UJA Federation. His lifelong kindness and love are memories that will not be forgotten and he will be missed by all of us who loved him dearly.
        GINSBURG-Martin. We are deeply saddened by the loss of our cousin Marty. An astute businessman with a creative and artistic spirit, he was a true gentleman who will be greatly missed. Our love to Bobbe, Allan and Carolyn, Bonnie, Abe & the entire Ginsburg family. The Chestnov Family
