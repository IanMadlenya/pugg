        CHU-Caryn, Ph.D. The students, staff and faculty of the Pathology Department of Mount Sinai School of Medicine mourn the untimely loss of our friend and colleague, Dr. Caryn Chu. Dr. Chu's tireless and dedicated research in cell and molecular pathobiology has yielded important clues to the function of cells in heart muscle, the nervous system and in cancers. Her recent breakthroughs have opened up new areas of research which will stimulate important new findings for years to come, and will surely lead to better lives for patients with cancer, heart and neurologic diseases. A Ph.D. graduate of Mount Sinai's Graduate School of Biological Sciences, Caryn touched the lives of everyone with her cheerful, friendly and consumately unselfish ways. She will be truly missed.
