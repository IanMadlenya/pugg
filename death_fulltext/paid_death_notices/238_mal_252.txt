        WERBER--Jack. We mourn the passing of Jack Werber, supporter, leader, friend, and remarkable human being. He entered the Buchenwald concentration camp in 1939 and was one of only 11 inmates (and the only Jew) who survived for 51/2 years until their liberation in 1944. But Jack Werber did more than survive. He helped save the lives of over 700 Jewish children imprisoned in Buchenwald. For this incredible achievement, and for his subsequent good deeds, he will be remembered by all who knew and loved him, especially his wife Millie, his children, David and Martin and their families. May his memory be a blessing and inspiration for all. Radomer Mutual Cultural Center Samuel Feldman, President
