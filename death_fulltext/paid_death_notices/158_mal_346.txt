        GRANT-Virgil V., 87, died March 29 in Atlanta after a long illness. He was Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and a Director of Caterpillar. He had been elected Treasurer in 1946 at the age of 33, then the youngest officer in the company's history. He was named president of Caterpillar Overseas in 1960 and moved to Geneva, Switzerland, for two years. When he returned in 1962 he was made a Vice President; he was elected Executive Vice President in 1971. For most of his career Mr. Grant was involved in international finance, establishing Caterpillar companies in a dozen foreign countries. His first trip to England was by ship; he was soon flying ''like a bird'' in small planes that could not yet climb above the clouds. In 1954 his plane crashed on landing in Rio de Janeiro Bay; he helped other passengers get out on a wing before they were picked up by the Brazilian Coast Guard. Virgil Grant was born on Feb. 25, 1913, in Southern Illinois, the son of Robert and Dorothy Simmons Grant. He graduated from a small high school in 1930, but driven by a desire for higher education, won a county scholarship to the U. of Illinois, where he earned a BS in accounting. Survivors are his wife, Esther Grant, whom he married in 1936, and his daughters, Lois Grant of Atlanta and Linda Grant of Rye, New York. He leaves three grandchildren and two great grandchildren. The family asks in lieu of flowers contributions in his memory to the United Negro College Fund.
