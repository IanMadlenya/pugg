        SCHNEIDER--Noel. We deeply mourn the passing of Noel Schneider on August 31, 2005, at age 85. Beloved devoted husband of Adele, his wife for more than 55 years; cherished dear father of Adam/ Sandy and Tracy; adored and adoring grandfather of Marna, Lorin, David, and Emma; revered brother of Joan Bodie; esteemed uncle to many nieces and nephews; and treasured by many relatives and longtime friends. He was a gifted, award-winning artist, recognized in Who's Who in American Art since 1973, whose works were beamed abroad by the U.S.I.A.'s Voice of America. He was a proud WWII volunteer veteran who survived more than four years of active service. After his retirement, he earned two associate degrees with honors, in Fine Arts and in Marine Technology. He was loved by all who were privileged to know him, and the memory of his long and wonderful life will live on in our hearts as a permanent tribute and celebration. Donations may be made to Families With Children From China Orphanage Assistance Program (www.fccny.org or P.O. Box 237065, Ansonia Station, New York, NY 10023) or to your chosen charity.
