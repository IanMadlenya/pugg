        LAUTMAN--Benjamin Harris. Dearest Wendy and Bill, we grieve for the loss of sweet Baby Ben. While barely four years old, he was indeed an Old Soul, who touched all of our lives. His fight was valiant and inspirational. We will remember and rejoice Ben & his spirit forever. With much love: Miranda; Stephanie, Stephen & Alexander; Margie, Warren, Samantha & Jacqueline; Leslie, Mark, Emma & Sam.
        LAUTMAN--Benjamin Harris. Our deepest sympathies and prayers are with the Lautman and King families. The Students, Staff, Board, and extended family of the TEAK Fellowship
