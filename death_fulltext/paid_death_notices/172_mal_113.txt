        KOPPEL-Richard U. On May 8 2001, attorney extraordinaire whose limitless devotion a nd loyalty to his clients earned him the respect of all. Richard's en thusiasm for the law and the intensity with which he approached each matter he worked on knew no bounds. For nearly fourteen years, I was privileged to practice with this giant of a man whose every action typified the word ''mensch''. He will be sorely missed both personally an d professionally.
