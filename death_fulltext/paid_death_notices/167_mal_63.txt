        MORRISON-William M. 74. Born Abbington, Pa. With great affection, he will be remembered for adventuring in to many kinds of different worlds, for extreme courage while battling years of cancer and the beautiful quality of making all he came in contact with feel special. May he be as free as the hawks he loved so much.
