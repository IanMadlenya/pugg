        BRACKEN-Kevin H., 37. Of Manhattan (formerly of Central Islip). Kevin was a firefighter with Engine Company 40 on the Upper West Side. He lost his life heroically in the line of duty at the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. An eight year veteran of the FDNY and former member of Engine Company 23, Kevin always had a joke & a smile for everyone he met. Cherished husband and best friend of Jennifer Liang, the two shared their passion for NYC, sports, sushi and travel. Devoted son of Hugh and Mary Bracken of Sandwich, MA (formerly of Central Islip). Loving brother of Billy Bracken & sisters Chickie Carlson, Kathy Brown and Patty Sample. Known by teammates as ''Coach Pugsley,'' Kevin coached and played on a co-ed softball team with Jen and also played on a team for his firehouse. An allaround athlete, he was an avid golfer and hockey player. Friends coined the term ''The Bracken Bounce'' to describe Kevin's uncanny luck and ability to get a shot into the woods back out onto the middle of the fairway. Along with many close friends, Kevin is also survived by a large & loving family including sister-in-law Nancy Bracken and brothers-in-law Ritch Carlson, Jim Brown and Chuck Sample, nieces Kerin, Keara and Mallory, nephew Joel, and uncle and Godfather Michael Norton. Kevin's quick wit, warm smile and companionship will be deeply missed by his family and friends. We love you very much and we will never be the same again. A memorial mass will be held at 9:30 AM, Wednesday, November 7, 2001 at St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan. In lieu of flowers, contributions to aid the families of missing members of Kevin's firehouse may be made in his name to the ''E-40/L-35'', 131 Amsterdam Avenue, NYC 10023.
        BRACKEN-Kevin Hugh. F.D.N.Y. Engine Co. 40. To his wife, our niece Jennifer, his parents Hugh & Mary, his family and many friends we send our prayers and sympathies. Brave Kevin, rest in peace. Cecilia and Hark Yip
