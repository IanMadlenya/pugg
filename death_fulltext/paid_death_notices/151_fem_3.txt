        HOLMAN-Constance Friess, M.D. The faculty and staff of New YorkPresbyterian Hospital and Weill Medical College of Cornell University are saddened by the passing of their esteemed colleague, Dr. Constance Friess Holman. Graduating at the top of her class at Cornell University Medical College in 1932, Dr. Friess was also the first woman to be named chief resident in medicine at The New York Hospital. Subsequently, she had a long and distinguished career in private practice in Manhattan while continuing on the medical staff and voluntary faculty of The New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. She and her late husband, Dr. Cranston W. Holman, also a distinguished member of the faculty and medical staff, were much beloved by patients, friends, and colleagues alike. Our deepest sympathies are extended to the entire family. New York-Presbyterian Hospital David B. Skinner, M.D. Vice Chairman, President & CEO Weill Medical College of Cornell University Antonio M. Gotto, Jr., M.D. The Stephen & Suzanne Weiss Dean Ralph I. Nachman, M.D. Chairman, Department of Medicine
