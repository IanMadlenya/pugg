        BERSTLER--Steven. The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn the passing of Steve Berstler, our brilliant and committed Chief Investment Officer and Treasurer, who for the past 10 years oversaw the museum's endowment with impressive acumen. He was universally respected both here and among his peers at other cultural and educational institutions. Despite his achievements, Steve was always modest and softspoken, and he was extraordinarily loyal and dedicated to the museum and the people who worked for him. We will miss him deeply and send heartfelt condolences to his wife Pam, his children Samantha and Spencer, and the entire family. James R. Houghton, Chrman. Philippe de Montebello, Dir. Emily K. Rafferty, President
