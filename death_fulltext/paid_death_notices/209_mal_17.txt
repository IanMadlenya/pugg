        NEWMAN -- Frank. The Teachers College community grieves the loss of our colleague, Frank Newman. Frank was a dreamer; a person of integrity, vision, warmth and humor; who spent his career battling for excellence, equity and a better tomorrow for education. He was a giant and there is no one to fill his shoes. The TC community sends condolences to his wife, Lucille, and the family he so deeply loved. Arthur Levine, President Teachers College, Columbia University
