        CLOWARD-Dr. Richard A. The Faculty, Advisory Council, Alumni Association, staff, and students of the Columbia University School of Social Work note with sadness the death of Professor Richard A. Cloward on August 20, in New York City. A 1950 M.S. graduate of the School and member of its faculty for 47 years, he was a prolific author, social activist and humanitarian whose scholarly writings and lifetime achievements brought distinction to Columbia and to the social welfare field. He will be long remembered for his unwavering commitment to the ideals of his profession and the welfare of the disadvantaged. His impact on social programs, education and the community will last long into the future. Sincerest condolences are extended to his wife, Dr. Frances Fox Piven; his children, Leslie Diamond & Daniel, Keith & Kevin Cloward, and other members of the family. Dr. Sheila B. Kamerman, Interim Dean
