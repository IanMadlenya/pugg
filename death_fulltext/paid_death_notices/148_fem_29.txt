        MANCUSO-Harriet Stein. Of New York City. Beloved wife of Robert, devoted mother of Rebecca, Miranda and Paul; daughter of Bernice and Bernard and sister of Frank, died on Wednesday, May 5, 1999 at age 48. The love of her family helped strenghten her during an almost four year struggle with pancreatic cancer. Her courage, especially during this past year, inspired her many friends and loved ones. Although her life was tragically cut short, her talents, love of family and generous spirit were abundant and will last forever. An honors graduate of New York University and Cornell Law School, she was a gifted and accomplished lawyer rising to partner at Davis and Cox. All who knew Harriet will miss her, each in a different and special way, for she touched all who were lucky enough to be her friend. In lieu of flowers the family suggests donations be made to The Calvary Hospice Fund, 1740 Eastchester Road, Bronx, New York 10461. Services were private.
