        LEW--Ruth. New York University mourns the passing of Ruth Lew, mother of Jack Lew, Executive Vice President. Together with her late husband, Irving, a graduate of NYU, Ruth Lew raised a wonderful family, managed a law office and a rare book business. She continued to work into her 70s and was a model of dignity and independence in aging. Our heartfelt sympathies go to our friend, Jack, and to the entire Lew family.
