        KRAMER--Burton, 74 years young, died on November 11, 2006, in his home after a two year hard fought battle with lung cancer. He is finally at peace. My best friend, confidante, devoted husband for 47 years to Ellen (Marx)Kramer, loving father of Judith Kramer McEvoy, a daughter who has a true heart of gold and son in law, Kevin, two wonderful children whom he loved dearly. Proud grandfather of Jacob and Max, the wait was worth it. Dad's heart was complete with their birth. They will carry on his pride and tradition in the Jewish faith. Survived by his 95 year old mother, Lily Kramer, and his two brothers. May his memory be a blessing to all of us who loved him. You will never be forgotten.
