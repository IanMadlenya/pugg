        DAVIS-Amanda. 32, author of ''Circling the Drain'' and ''Wonder When You'll Miss Me,'' on March 14, in a plane crash outside of Asheville, NC, while on a book tour for her just published new novel. Also perishing in the crash, her father and mother, Jim and Francie Davis. She is survived by her sister Joanna of San Francisco and her brother Adam of Lancaster, PA. All who loved Amanda-her family, friends, colleagues in the literary world and her students at Mills College, Oakland-mourn her untimely death, taken from us in the very flowering of her life. A memorial will be held at a later date.
