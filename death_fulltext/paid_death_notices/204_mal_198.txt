        WEINGOLD--Jonathan Mark. The Board of Directors, members, staff, and participants of the Association for the Help of Retarded Children/NYC mourn the passing of Jonathan Mark Weingold, 60, on January 11, 2004. Beloved son of Joseph and Barbara Weingold, he worked at the AHRC Betty Pendler/New York League Workshop for nearly 40 years, lived at the Jacobs Residence on West 81st St., in Manhattan, operated by AHRC and has been supported by AHRC's Guardianship Program since 1978. He was, to his father, Joseph Weingold, the first Executive Director of the New York State Association for Retarded Children, and to his mother, a loved and respected son. The memorial service will be held January 13, 2004 at 11:30 am at Riverside Memorial Chapel (Amsterdam Ave & 76th St). Himself a zealous advocate for the rights of others with disabilities, Jonathan will be missed by all who knew him. Genevieve O'Niel, President Michael Goldfarb, Executive Director AHRC
