        LILIENFELD--Arthur, born July 8, 1915, of West Palm Beach, Fla., and for more than 60 years of New York City. Died peacefully April 13, 2005. Arthur, loving and devoted husband of Margaret for 53 years, will long be remembered by his many friends for his wonderful good humor, cheerfulness, optimism, and much admired character. Having escaped his country of birth, Poland, just as World War II broke out, Arthur volunteered for active service in the British Royal Air Force in which he proudly served from 1940 to 1947, although he could have stayed away from the war in Argentina, where he was, for the duration. After the war, Arthur came to New York and was active in the Manhattan real estate industry for decades. Arthur was a very dear friend whose smile will glow in the memory of many for many years to come. With tenderest memories of 60 years of close friendship, Robert Laudau
