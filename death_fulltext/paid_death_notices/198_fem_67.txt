        MARKWITZ--Adele, a prominent Audiologist/Speech Language Pathologist of great professional acclaim, died on July 7. A founding member of the New York City Speech-Language-Hearing Association, a charter member of the New York State Speech - Language Hearing Association and a member of the American Association of Audiology, Markwitz was a certified member of the American Speech-language-Hearing Association. When the New York State Department of Education established licensure status for her profession Markwitz was appointed as a member of the first licensure board. She was among the first of her profession in New York State to establish an independent practice. Early on in her career she directed her practice toward the development of verbal language among hearing - impaired children. With the strong belief that a universal ''inborn language mechanism'' operates normally only when children are given exposure to an adequate sample of language at an early age, Markwitz practiced what she described as a developmental psycho - lin guistic approach to language acquisition for hearing-impaired children. With this approach, her children have developed to live productive and often professional lives, fluent in verbal language. She shared this approach with colleagues in numerous presentations as well as with students at New York University, where she taught. She will be sorely missed. Ruth Turner Annette Zaner
