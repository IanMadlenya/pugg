        MANN-Kalman Jacob. Hadassah, WZOA, mourns the passing of Professor Kalman Jacob Mann, beloved former Director General of the Hadassah Medical Organization from 1951-81. Seventh generation Jerusalemite, Professor Mann was the builder of the Hadassah Medical Center at Ein Karem and rebuilt Hadassah Hospital on Mt. Scopus after its liberation in 1967. A pioneer of health care administration and public health care in Israel, he was renowned as a visionary and a pragmatist, and was awarded the Israel Prize for his service to his people. A devoted father and grandfather, an educator and author, mentor and friend, Professor Mann was universally loved and respected for his warmth and wisdom. He will be greatly missed by all who knew him. Our deepest condolences to his wife Bluma, his children and grandchildren. May his memory be for a blessing, and may the family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Marlene E. Post, National President Beth Wohlgelernter, National Executive Director
