        SHEPARD-Sue. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) express profound sorrow at the loss of Sue Shephard of Saint Louis, the generous, loving and supportive partner of her husband, Irving, ATS Chairman of the Board. He was a founding father of the ATS Saint Louis Chapter and continues to be a guiding local, national and international force. As Technion Guardians, the Shepards demonstrated the highest level of commitment for the Technion. In recognition of their exemplary devotion, they were awarded the Albert Einstein Award in 1983, the highest honor bestowed by the ATS. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Irving Shepard and the entire Shepard family. American Society for TechnionIsrael Institute of Technology Lawrence S. Jackier, President Melvyn H. Bloom, Exec Vice Pres Alvin A. Wolff, Jr., Saint Lewis Chapter President Marvin Wool, Saint Lewis Chapter Chair Fred Greenberg, West Central Region Director
