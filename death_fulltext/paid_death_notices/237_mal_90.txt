        TURNER--Paul Stephan Age 72, died on the morning of October 7th, at UCLA Medical Center after six years of a courageous, and always hopeful, struggle with mantel cell lymphoma. Those who loved him, especially Linda, his wife of 43 years, their daughter Rebecca and her husband Scott Anthony, and Paul's beloved sister, Barbara Turner Sachs--as well as his numerous friends, relatives and associates, will never forget his kindness, humor and high intelligence applied to everything from music and literature to the law. His writings on business law were prodigious and his presentations in every legal situation were eloquent and beautifully reasoned. A light has gone out of our lives. Funeral services will be private. Memorial service pending. In lieu of flowers, contributions to Tower Cancer Research Foundation, 9090 Wilshire Boulevard, Beverly Hills 90211, will be appreciated.
