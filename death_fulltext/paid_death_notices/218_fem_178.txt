        CHILEWICH--Virginia Kaye, formerly Bloomgarden, nee Dottenheim. Her sudden death leaves behind a bereaved husband, Simon; her two sons, David and John Bloomgarden; her stepchildren, Mel and David Chilewich and Sandy Sultan; 12 grandchildren; and five greatgrandchildren. Virginia had a long career in theater, television and radio, where she was an exceptionally gifted interpreter of human experience and emotion. She was enormously proud of her service as senior hostess of the Stage Door Canteen during World War II, as it contributed to the breaking down of racial barriers in our armed forces. Funeral arrangements will be announced shortly. Simon and family
