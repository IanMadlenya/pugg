        NAYER-Herman R. (Hank) died in his sleep on April 23, 2003 in Oakland, California. He was 93 years old and had been living at St. Paul's Towers in Oakland, CA for the past 16 years. A graduate of Yale, class of '30, and of the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia, class of '34, Dr. Nayer was an internist who specialized in pulmonary medicine. He practiced at his office on 86th Street and at the NY Veterans Administration, Montefiore and Beth Israel Hospitals over a career that spanned 53 years and which included being a founding member and Medical Director of the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York (HIP), a president of the New York Lung Association and a Medical Officer with the New York City Fire Department. During WW II, Dr. Nayer served in the Army as a Captain and Chief of Medical Services as part of the European African Middle Eastern Campaign in Persia. A Renaissance man of extraordinary intelligence, he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and Alpha Omega Al Phi (medical honor society). An avid reader and scholar, he was a lover of Shakespeare, Freud and mathemathics and his curiosity ranged from politics to poetry. Herman Nayer was beloved by his patients for his kindness, expertise and sense of humor and will be sorely missed by his daughters, Anne of Davis, CA and Louise, of San Francisco, son-in-law Jim and granddaughters Sarah, Laura and Lily. (His wife Dorothy died in 2001).
