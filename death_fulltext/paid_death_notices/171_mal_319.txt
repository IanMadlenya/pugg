        FUERSTEIN-Saul. The Board of Trustees and staff of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation deeply mourn the loss of Saul Fuerstein, who retired in 1988 as Chief Preparator after 36 years with the Museum. His dedication to the care and preservation of the Guggenheim's collection for over three decades was unsurpassed, and his commitment and love of art will live on. We extend our most heartfelt sympathy to the members of his family. Peter B. Lewis, Chairman Peter O. Lawson-Johnston, Honorary Chairman Thomas Krens, Director Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation
