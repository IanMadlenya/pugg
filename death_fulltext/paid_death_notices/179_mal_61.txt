        RIEGNER-Gerhart. We mourn and honor the valiant courier who helped inform the world of the systematic Nazi attempt to murder the Jews of Europe, and who became a postwar champion of human rights, an elder statesman of interfaith dialogue. His voice will be sorely missed. Seymour D. Reich, Chairman Dr. Leon Feldman, Secretary International Jewish Committee On Interreligious Consultations
