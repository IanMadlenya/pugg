        GOTTLIEB--Lester, on June 7, 2006 at the age of 92. Loving husband of Ruth, patient father of Pamela, Michael, and Gabrielle. Grandfather of Audrey, Joshua, and Alexandra. Great grandfather of Kaitlynn and Josh. He was a bringer of light, music, and humor to the world. He sang with a clear, ringing, joyful, tenor voice until the end of his life. He will be terribly missed by all who knew him.
