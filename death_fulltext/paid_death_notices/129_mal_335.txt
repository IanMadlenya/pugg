        RICE-James P. The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) notes with sadness the passing of an outstanding Jewish Civil Servant who, for a decade after World War II, played a major role in JDC assisting Holocaust survivors in a variety of postings: in Salzburg, Paris, Geneva and Frankfurt. He served as JDC liaison with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, International Red Cross, International Council of Voluntary Agencies, as well as the U.S. Army. We extend condolences to his sons, Michael and Bill Rice, and grandsons. Jonathan W. Kolker President Michael Schneider Executive Vice President Ambassador Milton A. Wolf Chairman of the Board
