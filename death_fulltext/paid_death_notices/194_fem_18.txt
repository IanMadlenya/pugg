        CHIA-Frances T.C. Died on February 27th, after a long and courageous battle with cancer. A devoted wife and mother, Mrs. Chia always put the needs of others before hers. She was a woman of boundless generosity and kindness to her family and far-reaching circle of friends around the world. As a part of her dedication to philanthropic activities, Mrs. Chia served on the Board of Trustees at the American Red Cross, Westchester County Chapter, and NYU Downtown Hospital, and she was a member of the Advisory Council of The Rockefeller University. Mrs. Chia was also the co-founder and President of the Chia Family Foundation, a non-profit organization that funds various projects, including public health initiatives in China and in New York City's Chinatown. Mrs. Chia is survived by her husband, Pei-yuan Chia, a former Vice Chairman of Citicorp-Citibank; one son, Douglas, of New York City; two daughters, Katherine, of New York City, and Candice, of Philadelphia; and three grandchildren. A memorial service will be held at The Stanwich Club, Greenwich, CT, on March 5, 11:30 AM.
