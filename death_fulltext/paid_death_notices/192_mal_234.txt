The idea of a dinner theater was his and bore fruit with the Meadowbrook Dinner Theater in New Jersey. In Sacramento he managed Music Circus in the Round and the musicals at the California State Fair in collaboration with Howard and Young. He then managed the touring company of ''Camelot'', with Richard Burton and went on for many years to undertake the same role for Marcel Marceau in his American tours. With San Francisco as his base, he worked as manager of the Curran Theater and helped in the revival and managing of the Orpheum Theater. He will always be fondly remembered by friends and theaterfolk worldwide for his professionalism and for his joie de vivre and bon vivant charm.
