        OPPENHEIM-Selma. The Yeshiva University family is saddened by the passing of a dear friend who, with her beloved husband, Henry, was a Fellow of our Sy Syms School of Business. Dedicated to the advancement of higher education and the welfare of the Jewish people, they established SSSB's Selma and Henry Oppenheim Scholarship Fund-ensuring the perpetuation of their honored name for future generations. We extend our heartfelt condolences to children, Steven and Richard, grandchildren, and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University David S. Gottesman, Chairman Board of Trustees
