        JEZER--Marty. Marty Jezer, 64, activist and author, died June 11, 2005 at home in Brattleboro, VT. Born and raised in the Bronx, he influenced four decades of progressive politics. He considered his greatest accomplishment his co-founding of the Working Group on Electoral Democracy and co-authoring of ground-breaking model legislation for publicly financed election campaigns. He wrote a widely distributed column for the Brattleboro Reformer and authored highly praised biographies of Rachel Carson and Abbie Hoffman, a postwar history of the U.S. (1945-1960), and a personal memoir about his life as a stutterer. Marty is survived by his loving partner of the past twelve years, Arlene Distler, his daughter Kathryn Ruth Jezer-Morton, her husband Gray Miles, Kathryn's mother Mimi Morton, and step-children Josh, Aaron, Rachel, and Ezra Distler.
