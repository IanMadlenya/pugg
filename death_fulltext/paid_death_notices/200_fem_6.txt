        WEISS--Doris. We were more than just mother and daughter, we were best friends, the two of us, a circle of love, never to be broken, never to be forgotten. Our mornings spent doing the Times crossword, 12 daily phone calls back and forth, driving around doing our errands together, winters on Fisher Island and of course, spending your 70th in Paris. All this and so much more will be deeply missed. These past 18 months I have been so proud of you as I fought beside you for your life. I let you go now with my blessing so that your suffering may end. You have given me the greatest gift a daughter could recieve in your never ending love and I pass this on to my children and future grandchildren. I love you. Your are in my heart forever. Love, Wendy
