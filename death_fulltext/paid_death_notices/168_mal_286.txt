        HOFFMAN-Mendl. The YIVO Institute for Jewish Research mourns the passing of our distinguished emeritus trustee, Mendl Hoffman, visionary businessman, ardent supporter of Yiddish language and culture, who served on the YIVO Board for more than two decades. His connection with YIVO dates to 1945, when as a teenage Holocaust survivor, he helped identify looted YIVO library books (shipped by the Nazis to a warehouse near Frankfurt am Main). In 1947 these books were repatriated to YIVO in New York. He became a volunteer cataloger of these books, and then a Board member. His unique contributions to YIVO will be sorely missed. May his memory be for a blessing. Bruce Slovin, Chairman Dr. Carl J. Rheins, Executive Director
