Doctor Reis trained more than one hundred scientists around the world and received numerous awards for his work throughout a long and illustrious career. A memorial service is scheduled at the Century Association, 7 West 43rd Street on Friday, November 17th at 4 PM.

        REIS-Donald J., MD. The Boards, Faculty and Staff of Weill Medical College of Cornell University and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital are deeply saddened by the passing of Dr. Donald J. Reis, the George C. Cotzias Distinguished Professor of Neurology and Neuroscience and the founder and director of Weill Cornell's Laboratory of Neurobiology. A leading investigator in neuroscience who trained more than a hundred scientists now working around the world, Dr. Reis was noted for his contributions to the understanding of how the brain is organized to express emotional behaviors and how it controls blood pressure, protects itself against strokes and generates neurotransmitters, especially those affecting mood and behavior. His findings on stroke, dementia, Parkinsonism and schizophrenia have had a broad impact not only on neurobiology but also on internal medicine, psychiatry and psychosomatic medicine. His warmth, intelligence and humanity will be sorely missed. We extend our deepest condolences to his entire family.
