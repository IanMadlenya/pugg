        BERK -- Irving A. Passed away June 16, after a short illness. He died peacefully at home surrounded by some of his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, as well as his beloved companion of eight years, Judy, and her daughter Sandy. He was in excellent health for 100 years, going to work six days a week until three weeks ago. Although the Berk Trade School, the Berk Plumbing Company, and the Berk Management Company were his passions for the last 66 years, he always had time for family and rarely missed a family function. We will all miss him dearly. He was married for 54 years to Ann until her demise. His daughter Bascia predeceased him. He is survived by Bascia's four children, Julian, Allan, Joyce and Ronald, his son Joel and his two children, Michelle and Kevin, and his son Harvey and his three children, Diana, Haley and Daniel. His eight great-grandchildren are Sara, Stephanie, Melissa, Lindsey, Courtney, Brian, Alexa and Charles. Services will be held Sunday at 11:30 AM, at the Sherman's Flatbush Memorial Chapel located at 1283 Coney Island Ave., Brooklyn, followed by the interment at New Montefiore Cemetery.
