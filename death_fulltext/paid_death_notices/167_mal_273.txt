A surgeon at The New York Hospital -Cornell Medical Center since 1949, he gained an international reputation for his innovations in hernia surgery. Incorruptible, affectionate, and generous, he was a model of common sense, intelligence, and simplicity. His inquiring mind and his joy of living were legendary. Dr. Wantz contributed so much to surgical science, especially hernia surgery, and to the lives of generations of surgeons whose paths and careers he guided. We extend our condolences to his family.
