        VALDIMER-Bleu, 30, of NYC. Family and friends mourn the loss of a devoted son and friend. As an entrepreneur, designer and cofounder of Project Dragon, Bleu's generosity, talent and warmhearted spirit touched the lives of countless individuals. He will be deeply missed by all those who had the privilege of knowing him-especially his father Ed, his mother Terry, his sister Leigh, his partners Stash and Futura, and Missi, the love of his life. He will always be in our thoughts. Funeral service Sunday at 1:45 PM, at Riverside Memorial. ''When you coming home Dad, I don't know when, but we'll get together then.''
