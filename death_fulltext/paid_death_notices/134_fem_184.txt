        SCHWARTZ-Justice Hilda G. The Board of Justices of the New York State Supreme Court, First District, deeply mourns the loss of our illustrious former colleague, Justice Hilda G. Schwartz. Justice Schwartz served with the greatest ability, first on the New York City Magistrates Court, then on the New York City Civil Court, and then on the New York State Supreme Court, for a total of 24 years. She was one of the very first women to sit on any New York court, and she lent distinction to all of them. Our heartfelt sympathy goes to all her family. Beatrice Shainswit, President
