        HARMANN--Vincent William. 72, died peacefully June 17, in the arms of his loving wife Victoria. His survivors, brothers Robert, sisters Jone Robinson and Margie Shenk, daughter Karen Onesti, sons Mark, Michael and Brian and daughter Diana will always remember him as a hard worker who never complained. No matter what complication life faced him with, he conquered it feeling ''just fine.'' His perception of the world was unlike any other, and that is something we will carry with us forever. Services Tuesday, 11:45 AM, at ''The Riverside'', 76th Street and Amsterdam Ave.
