        RUBIN-Rose Natalie On August 21 in Los Angeles, California. Mrs. Rubin lived in New York City and was the widow of William Morris Rubin. Mrs. Rubin graduated from Radcliffe College in 1929, traveled to the Ukraine in 1935 to visit the village of her family's origin, and worked with the Russian-American Institute and Russian War Relief during World War II. In December 1956, she and her partner, Mr. Michael Stillman, founded Monitor Records. Today Monitor Records continues as part of the Smithsonian Recordings Collection. Rose is survived by devoted family members Nancy B. Mikelsons, Adam C. Mikelsons and Donald H. Goldhamer of Oak Park, Illinois, and Susan Rubin and Charles Degelman of Los Angeles, California. Rose was a fighter of injustice all her life, a wonderful friend and an inspiring mother. In her later years, she took particular delight in encouraging and supporting younger generations as they started their life journeys. She will be deeply missed, and her life will be celebrated by people of all ages. A memorial celebration will be held at her home in New York City on Saturday, October 16, details to be announced. In lieu of flowers, donations to Monthly Review, 122 West 27th Street, New York, NY 10001 will be deeply appreciated by her family.
