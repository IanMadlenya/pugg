        YEE-James T. The Staff and Board of The Independent Television Service (ITVS) mourns the loss of the former Executive Director, James T. Yee, who passed away on March 17, 2001, in Piedmont, CA, after an eighteen month battle with cancer. Yee, a long-time crusader for plurality in public television and an advocate for independent media producers, was the Executive Director of ITVS from 1994 through 2000, and The National Asian American Telecommunications Association (NAATA) from 1981 to 1994. He was a trusted ally, a formidable but fair adversary to those who dragged their feet in the campaign to diversity the images seen on American television and a seasoned producer who received a National Emmy Award for ''aka Don Bonus.'' We send our deepest condolences to his wife, Betty Quan Yee, children, Jane and Liam Lee, his brother, Calvin Yee, and sisters, Diane Weirck, and Geraldine Eng, and their families. Memorial contributions may be sent to: James T. Yee Mentorship Program, NAATA, 346 9th Street, San Francisco, CA 94103. A Memorial Service will be held Friday March 23, 2001 at 10:30 A.M. at Chapel Of The Chimes, 4499 Piedmont Avenue, Oakland, CA. Judy Tam, Actng Exec Dir David Liu, Dir Prog Devlpmnt
