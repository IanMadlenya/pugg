        LEAHY--Joan E. (nee Gomez-Franco), on September 28, 2003 in Henderson, NV from lung cancer. Born 1934 in New York City to Harry and Ada Allen Gomez-Franco, Joan moved with her family to Mexico City in 1938 where she spent much of her young life. She returned to the US to finish high school and attend Fordham University earning a BA in 1956. In 1957 Joan began a long career in advertising sales with A.C. Nielsen Co., and later BBDO and SSC&B. She began a nearly 25 year career with the NBC television network in the early 1970s. For most of her career with NBC, Joan was a prime-time network sales account executive and, for a time, Vice President, Marketing and VP of daytime and late-night network sales. Although too humble to acknowledge the fact, Joan was a trailblazer in the then male-dominated field of Advertising and helped break the ''glass ceiling'' for many of the women who followed. According to family lore, which may in fact be true, Joan was the first woman to be served a drink at the bar of ''21 Club'' in NYC where she often met with clients. Joan was a long time resident of Manhattan, and concurrently Sag Harbor, NY. After she retired from NBC in 1996, she moved to Santa Fe, NM and later the Las Vegas area. Joan is survived by three sisters, Linda Royer of Malverne, NY, Suzanne Mantone of Oyster Bay Cove, NY, and Barbara White of Arroyo Grande, CA. She was preceded in death by her sister, Eleanor Rofheart in 2002. Joan is also survived by several nieces and nephews, and many friends throughout the Country. Aunt Joan, as she was known to many in the family, will be greatly missed for her sharp intellect, good humor and straight forward, no-nonsense way. At Joan's request, no memorial services were held.
