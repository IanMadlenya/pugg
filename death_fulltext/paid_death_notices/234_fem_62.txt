        BRECHER--Roslyn K. Hadassah, WZOA, mourns the passing of Roslyn K. Brecher. Wise counsel to all and mentor to many, she has been a member of the National Board since 1957. As such, there is not a major decision or project she has not influenced with her intellect, passion for Zionism and commitment to the organization. She will be sorely missed. We send our deepest condolences to her beloved husband, Walter, and their three children and grandchildren; may they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. June Walker, National President Morlie Levin, National Exec. Dir.
