        GREENBERG-Filomen D'Agostino. The entire NYU Law School community is saddened by the loss of Filomen D'Agostino Greenberg (Class of 1920). Fil, one of our most vibrant alumnae, had a lifelong commitment to the Law School. From her good counsel to seven deans to her extraordinary generosity to the School, she was an invaluable member of our family. She and her late husband, Max E. Greenberg (Class of 1919), always will be remembered for their support of the Greenberg Faculty Research Fund, the Greenberg Professorship in Contract Law, the D'Agostino Residence Hall, and our beautiful Greenberg Lounge. Throughout her career, Fil was a trailblazer and a truly extraordinary role model for our students and alumni. Our hearts and thoughts are with her family and friends.
