        LEE-Emily S. Turtle Bay Music School mourns with great sadness the passing of our chairman, Emily S. Lee. Em Lee joined the School's Board of Trustees in 1928 as a charter member and has remained a Trustee ever since. Her passion, vision and drive have made an indelible stamp on TBMS. Throughout her tenure, Em Lee was an unwavering supporter of the School. She chaired successful campaigns to acquire the present building, construct the concert hall, and strengthen the building and endowment funds. In addition to her active involvement with TBMS, Em was an accomplished amateur ice skater and enjoyed painting and gardening. Em Lee once said that her life ''has been bound up with Turtle Bay Music School since its earliest days.'' Our most heartfelt condolences to the entire Lee family on the loss of this remarkable woman.
