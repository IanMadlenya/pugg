        PECHENIK-Norma. The officers, leadership, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Norma Pechenik. Her daughter, Marjorie Rosenthal, is a longtime leader and supporter of the Women's Campaign, a member of the Board of Directors, and chair of the Resource Line Governing Committee. We extend our deepest sympathies to her children, Marjorie, Stephen, and Linda Montague; her sisters, Sue Shapiro and Lilly Edelstein; her brother, Barry Berns; her grandchildren; great-granchildren; and the entire family. May her memory be for a blessing. Larry A. Silverstein, Board Chair Louise B. Greilsheimer, President Mady Harman, Campaign Vice Chair, and Women's Campaign Chair Stephen D. Solender, Exec.
