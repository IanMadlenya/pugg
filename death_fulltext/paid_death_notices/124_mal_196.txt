        ROTHENBERG-Richard, Dr. On May 15, 1997. The entire Stuyvesant Family - students, staff, administration, alumni and parents, deeply mourn the sudden and untimely loss of their dear friend, teacher and colleague, Richard Rothenberg, Assistant Principal, Mathematics. A graduate, Class of 1963, Dr. Rothenberg epitomized the best of the academic and scholarly tradition of Stuyvesant High School. This kind and compassionate, gentle man, will be sorely missed for the strength of his character and his contributions to this Institution. His memory will live on in the hearts of his thousands of devoted students. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Rita, his children, Terri, Fran, and Jonathan, and his entire family.
