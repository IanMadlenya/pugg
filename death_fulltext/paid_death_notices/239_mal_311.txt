        FORD--Gerald R. With great sadness we mourn the passing of our very dear friend, President Gerald Ford. We feel so lucky to have shared so many happy times with President Ford and Betty as well as having them as beloved role models. We feel privileged to have memories that will last forever. President Ford was a great supporter of my career from the time he joined the board of Shearson Loeb Rhodes back in 1980 to the times at American Express to the new start at Commercial Credit through the formation of Citigroup. He always worked so hard and with great wisdom to help guide our company on a path towards greatness for shareholders, employees and customers. Though our hearts are heavy, we feel so privileged to have had the President and Betty as part of our lives. Our thoughts, prayers, and love are with Betty, the children and grandchildren. With Love, Joan and Sandy Weill
