        HISCOX-Elizabeth Ann Wilson, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist, died of heart failure on October 23 in her Manhattan home. She was 81. Dr. Hiscox, born in Ada, Okla., was a former director of counseling services at New York University and Baruch College and also had a private practice. Her family, friends, colleagues and clients mourned her loss. Her luminous spirit, wisdom and compassion were a bright beacon to those she guided. She lives on, cherished, in our hearts. In keeping with her wishes, no memorial service was held. Donations may be made to a battered-women's shelter or to Planned Parenthood. Jeanne Broadbent, Joseph De Cola Susan Rubinowitz
