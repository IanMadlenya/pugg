        GARFUNKEL-Harold J. The Officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Harold J. Garfunkel, a cherished friend who was deeply devoted to the Jewish community. As a dedicated leader, he embraced the compassionate commitment of his father, who was a founder of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York, the predecessor to UJA-Federation. Following in his father's footsteps, he served as a life trustee of Federation, and was a longtime officer of Altro, one of our earliest beneficiary agencies. We extend our sincerest condolences to his daughter, Marjorie Baker Bachrach, and his son-in-law, Robert Lee Bachrach; his daughter, Deborah G. Bloch, and his sonin-law, Robert W. Bloch; and his entire family. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair James S. Tisch, President Stephen D. Solender, Exec V.P.
