        GRAHAM--Ruth Bell. Ruth was a great pioneer of faith and a full partner with her husband, Rev. Billy Graham, in spreading the Word and God around the world. Her many writings told a vivid story of living a life of commitment and service to the Lord. We mourn her loss as we also celebrate her exemplary life. American Bible Society
