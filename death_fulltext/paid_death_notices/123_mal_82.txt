        ROSEN-Herbert S. On Sunday, April 6, a month after the death of his wife of 58 years, Shirley. He was a devoted husband, beloved and loving father of David Rosen and Jane Barowitz. Father-in-law of Barbara Goren and Elliott Barowitz and perceptive and indulgent grandfather of Zack and Jordan Barowitz, Nick, Adam, Annie and Sarah Rosen. An executive, a builder and developer and a business consultant, Herbert Rosen brought energy, imagination and passion to all his endeavors. Deeply attached to life, he endured years of illness with heroic optimism and tenacity. We miss him very much.
