        FLANIGAN--Brigid. The Patrons Program staff is profoundly saddened by the death of our longtime friend Brigid Flanigan. Together with her husband, Peter Flanigan, they transformed St. Ann School in Manhattan and many other inner city schools in the Archdiocese of New York. Their collective wisdom, passion and generosity impacted thousands of elementary school children for almost 20 years. We will miss her smile, warmth and charm. We extend our deepest sympathy to Peter and the entire Flanigan family. Jill Kafka, Exec Dir William Finneran, Chairman of the Board Patrons Program
