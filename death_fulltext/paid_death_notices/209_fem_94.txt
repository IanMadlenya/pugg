        GROSS--Aasta. Age 70, died suddenly on Saturday, June 12, 2004. She was the beloved wife of Donald, mother of Gary and Eric and grandmother of Amanda, Austin and Spencer. Along with her extended family, both in Norway and here, we all mourn the passing of a true ''lover of life.'' All who have known her have been touched by goodness, warmth and love, which will remain with us forever.
        GROSS--Aasta. To our beautiful friend Aasta, we know how much family meant to you and am so glad our two families could spend many wonderful times together. We will miss you. Judi and Charlie Friedlaender
