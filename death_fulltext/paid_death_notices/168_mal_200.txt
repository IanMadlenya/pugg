        FRANKEL-Rabbi William. We record with profound sorrow the passing of our beloved colleague who served several pulpits becoming founding rabbi of Am Yisrael Conservative Congregation in the Chicago area in 1968, a synagogue he served until his retirement in 1994. We express our deepest condolences to his widow, Toby Durbin Frankel, his children, David, Joshua, Daniel and Dr. Deborah Brigell and to all who were touched through his rabbinate. Rabbi Vernon H. Kurtz, President Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Executive Vice President The Rabbinical Assembly
