        CREEL-Dana S. The Board of Directors and the staff of Boscobel Restoration, Inc. express their sincere sympathy on the death of Dana Creel, for many years a director, a friend, and an advisor. His wise counsel in the areas of restoration and preservation will be sorely missed by Boscobel and other historic sites.
