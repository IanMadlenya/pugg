        CORDOVANO-Frank, 84, of New York City. Died September 24. Beloved husband of Mary for 60 years. Loving father and father-inlaw to Felicia Cordovano, Larry and Mary Ann Caputo, Frank and Laura Cordovano. Proud grandfather to Alicia Cordovano, Larry, Frank and Christina Caputo and Julia Cordovano. Affectionately known as ''Poppi'' by all who loved and adored him. His giant bearhugs and kisses, his gentle teasing, his deep care and concern for all he loved and his strong helping hands will be profoundly missed by us all. For ''Poppi,'' family was everything and our lives were immeasurably enriched as a result. May God bless his gentle and loving soul and reward him for his great goodness. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to Columbus Citizens Foundation Twin Tower Fund, 8 E. 69 St, NYC 10021. True to his nature and all that he lived for, in his final days he was greatly concerned for the families of the victims of the World Trade Center tragedy.
