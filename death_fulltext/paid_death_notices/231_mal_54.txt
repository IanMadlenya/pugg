        IRIS--Herbert. We mourn the loss of Herbert M. Iris, beloved husband, father, friend and a compassionate visionary leader of the Jewish Community of MetroWest, NJ. Mr. Iris died April 4, 2006 in Palm Beach Gardens, FL. A successful real estate developer in his profession, Mr. Iris was a ''builder'' of the Jewish community, serving as General Campaign Chair for UJC Campaign, among many roles. The MetroWest Community is deeply saddened by this loss and extends its heartfelt sympathies to the family. His legacy will live forever.
