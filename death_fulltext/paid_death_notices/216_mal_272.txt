        CARTER--Sidney, MD. The Board of Trustees, Administration and Medical Staff of Blythedale Children's Hospital notes with deep sorrow the passing of our dear friend and colleague. For more than 15 years, Sidney was a leader in our Department of Neurology. His unique knowledge and experience provided superb medical care to our children. A warm, wonderful person whose kindness and compassion touched all those he came in contact with, Dr. Carter made a profound positive difference in the lives of his patients and left a lasting legacy to students and colleagues alike. We extend our deep and sincere sympathies to his wife Elizabeth (Buff) and his entire family.
