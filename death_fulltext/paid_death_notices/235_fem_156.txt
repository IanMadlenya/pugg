        OBOLENSKY--Mary Elizabeth Morris. Officers, Directors and Members of the Soldiers', Sailors', Marines' and Airmen's Club are saddened by the death on 21 August, 2006 of their esteemed Board Member and friend, Mary Obolensky after a long illness. Born in Asheville, NC of Navy parents in 1934, her first job with the FBI was in Seattle, WA. Some years later, she served with distinction as a Supervisory Flight Attendant with TWA. In New York City and marrried, she became known for her dedication and easy-going efficiency during her many years of support for worthy philanthropic organizations. The International Debutante Ball, April In Paris, Children's Cancer and Blood Foundation, The N.Y. Hospital, Russian Nobility Association, Musician's Emergency Fund, Masonic Charities, Holland Lodge, Police Athletic League and our own SSMAC, were all beneficiaries of her legendary charm. But it was her good humor and the just plain fun that she inspired in all of those she touched that was key to her success. A Celebration of her good works will be held at 11 AM on Wednesday, 30 August, 2006 at Church of the Incarnation, Madison Ave. at 35th Street, New York with reception to follow at SSMAC, 283 Lexington Ave. at 37th Street, where donations in lieu of flowers would be most welcome. Interment will be held privately at noon on Thursday, 31 August at the Astor/Obolensky family plot in the Rhinebeck, NY Cemetery. R.I.P. Ivan Obolensky, Chairman/CEO William McShane, President
