        LANDE-Anita. We deeply mourn the sad passing of our dear friend and loving neighbor, a resident of 325 Central Park West for 63 years. Supporting the ideals of the West Side Urban Renewal Area, her passion and advocacy was invaluable in the creation of our cooperative. A brilliant writer and voice of reason and kindness. She will be missed by us all. We send our deepest condolences to her husband Robert and all her family. Residents of 325 Cooperative, Inc.
