        WASSERMAN-Eric. Central Synagogue, its Board of Trustees and members, record with heartfelt sorrow the passing of Eric Wasserman, the beloved son of our Vice President, Samuel Wasserman and Sandra Wasserman and cherished brother of Robert and Cary. We also extend condolences to his mother, Pat LaPedus. Eric brought joy, friendship and humor to his family and to all who were fortunate to have known him. In the words of the Psalmist, he ''lived with integrity, did what was right, and spoke the truth in his heart.'' We offer our profound sympathy and great love to his family. Peter J. Rubinstein, Rabbi Martin I. Klein, President
