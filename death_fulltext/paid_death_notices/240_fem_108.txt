        VLADECK--Judith. An unflagging advocate, she was also was a superb teacher and mentor. She taught us how to reason, how to fight, and the importance of practicing law with passion and grace. Our condolences to the Vladeck family, especially to Anne, Bruce, and David. Christopher D. Berner Carrie H. Cohen James D. Essek Edward Hernstadt
