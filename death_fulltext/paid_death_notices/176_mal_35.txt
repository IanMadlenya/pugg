        BARUCH-Marcel. The Board of Trustees, administration and staff of The Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center and the Schulman Schachne Institute for Nursing and Rehabilitation record with profound sorrow the untimely death of our beloved and distinguished past Senior Vice President for Long Term Care. Mr. Baruch joined Brookdale in 1965 and in 1970 was appointed Administrator of the Samuel and Bertha Schulman Institute. In 1993 he became Senior Vice President for Long Term Care until his retirement in 1999 due to illness, but continued to provide his wisdom and guidance as our consultant until his death. Although combating cancer for many years, he was a man with an abiding concern for the welfare of others. Marcel Baruch was a valued friend to all who knew him. May the memory of his countless good deeds help ease his family's pain. We will sorely miss him. Our condolences to his wife, Miriam, daughters, Karen, Susan and Rona, and their families. Alvin I. Kahn, M.D., FACP, Chairman, Board of Trustees David P. Rosen, President and CEO Edwin L. Schulman, President Emeritus, Board of Directors, Schulman Schachne Institute Dr. David I. Schachne, President, Executive Committee Cosmo J. LaCosta, FACHE, Executive Vice President for Long Term Care Richard J. Fogler, M.D., Senior Vice President and CMO
