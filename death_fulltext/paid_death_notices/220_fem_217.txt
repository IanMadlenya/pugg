        ANGLIN -- Helen, Grand Dame of New York City, dies at 102. Helen Anglin was born in Youngstown, Ohio to John and Elizabeth Verosic in 1902 and had six siblings: Michael, Louis, John, Joseph, Stephen and Elizabeth. She left Youngstown to pursue her dreams of opening a millinery store in New York City at the age of 15. She lived on the Upper East Side and Atlantic Beach and met the friends that she would have for the remainder of her life. She was married to Michael Angelino in the late 1920's but chose divorce after four years and spent the remainder of her life as a fun-loving single woman. The love of her life was Phillip Bookbinder, with whom she spent 25 happy years until his death. Her great-niece, Janet Carlson Sanders, was made her legal guardian in 1996, and then Helen moved to her home in Brooklyn Heights and lived her remaining years with Janet, her husband John and their children, twins Helen (named for her great-great aunt) and Harry. Her beloved nurses, Shari Collazo and Ann Holder, who became members of her family, cared daily for Helen. She was a well-known and infamous figure in her neighborhood and was active in her church, St. Charles Borromeo. Mass of Christian burial at St. Charles Borromeo on Saturday, May 28, 2005 at 10AM.
