        LIVINGSTON - Elisabeth Sloan Pratt, age 96, died at her home on March 8, 2002. Born and raised in Brooklyn, she had resided in Oyster Bay Cove, NY since 1939. John Holyoke Livingston, her husband of 64 years, died in 1995. An avid golfer in earlier days and an active watercolorist until age 95 when failing eyesight forced her to quit, Mrs. Livingston was well known in Brooklyn and on the North Shore of Long Island for her philanthropy. A memorial gathering will be held on a date to be announced. Contributions to the Art League of Long Island or Packer Collegiate Institute of Brooklyn would be appreciated.
