        BLOOM--Shirley (nee Okon). 73 years young on June 19, 2004. Vivacious, brave and multi-talented, eager to learn and to teach, she embraced life fully and often ''pushed the envelope''. Survived by husband Bob, children Wendy and Paul, daughter-in-law Michele and the most recent delights of her life--grandsons Daniel, Theodore and Nathaniel. She will be deeply missed by her family and friends.
