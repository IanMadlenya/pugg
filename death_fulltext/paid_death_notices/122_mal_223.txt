        ABRAMOV-S. Zalman. The officers, members, and staff of the American Jewish Committee are deeply saddened by the death of Zalman Abramov, chairman of the Israel Advisory Board of AJC's Institute on American Jewish-Israeli Relations (IAJIR) from 1983 to 1994. In a distinguished career, Dr. Abramov served as a former deputy speaker of the Knesset and as a member of the Israeli delegation to the U.N. General Assembly and of numerous Jewish organizations. A prolific author and scholar, he dedicated his life to the betterment of the Jewish condition worldwide and to greater understanding and cooperation between American Jews and Israelis. His wise counsel will be sorely missed. We send our condolences to his wife Ayala, his three children, and the rest of his grieving family. Robert S. Rifkind, President David A. Harris, Executive Dir. Morton Kornreich, Chair, U.S. Advisory Board, IAJIR Dr. Steven Bayme, Director, IAJIR
