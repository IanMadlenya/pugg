        CILENTO-Orazio ''Ray''. The NYC Central Labor Council, its officers, staff and members are saddened by the sudden death of our friend, longtime labor activist and 40year-member of L.3 IBEW. Ray was truly a ''volunteer extraordinaire'' to this Council, not only for the outstanding job he did in putting together our annual Labor Day parades, but for the millionand-one daily details, and for the permits and sound systems for rallies and demonstrations of our many affiliates. Ray was a warm friend to all, always joking and laughing, so loved his beautiful granddaughter Jessica, and was extremely proud of his daughter Lenore (a teacher), and his son Mario (NYS AFL-CIO public relations) and was looking forward to Mario's upcoming marriage to Andrea Curro. To his wife, Aurora, sister Erminia, his son-in-law George Viola, all his family, friends, and co-workers, our heartfelt sympathies. Ray will be sorely missed by so many.
