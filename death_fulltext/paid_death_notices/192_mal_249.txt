        KRUK-Ariel ''Eric.'' The Officers, Board of Trustees, Rabbi Stephen Berkowitz, Rabbi Emeritus Robert Lehman, the Affiliates and the Membership of the Hebrew Tabernacle Congregation extend our heartfelt condolences to the family of Ariel ''Eric,'' to his father, our own Cantor of the Hebrew Tabernacle, Michael Kruk, to his mother, Polina, sister, Nili, and grandparents, Sara and David Tovarovsky and Tovah Petel, on the untimely passing of their extraordinary son, brother and grandson. He blessed us for 18 years with his ebullient youth and sweet presence. We hold the most beautiful memories and he will be remembered forever with love, never to be forgotten. A Shiva service will be held at the Hebrew Tabernacle on Monday, January 20, at 4 PM. Donations may be made to the Hebrew Tabernacle-Ariel ''Eric'' Kruk Memorial Camp Scholarship Fund.
