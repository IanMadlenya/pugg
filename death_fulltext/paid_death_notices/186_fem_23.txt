        GLASSMAN-Harriett S. Died on July 5 after a long and courageous battle with cancer. Loving wife of Jay Glassman. Mother of Mimi (David) Rukeyser & Julie Glassman. Sister of Susan (Ken) White. Adoring grandmother of Emily and Sara. Harriett was a devoted wife and wonderful mother. She always had time to listen, loved to cook, read and knit. In the summertime Harriett's favorite place to be was sitting on the dock at her summer home in Maine. Harriett's friends and family were lucky to have known her and will miss her terribly. Harriett devoted the last eighteen years of her career working at The Children's Rehabilitation Center at St. Agnes, where she was the Assistant Director of Education. Her passion was counseling the parents of disabled children. Because of her great love for the children's center her family strongly requests that any donations be sent to The Children's Rehabilitation Center at St. Agnes, 305 North Street, White Plains, New York 10605. Services will be held Sunday, July 7th, at 11:30 A.M., at the Zion Memorial Chapel, Mamaroneck, New York.
