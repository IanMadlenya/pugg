A staunch advocate of individuals with developmental disabilities, he served as Associate Executive Director of ACRMD (now known as Lifespire) until his retirement in 1991. For well over a quarter century, Mickey advocated at all levels of government for needed services and is well-known for ''blowing the whistle'' on government. The reference to ''blowing the whistle'' is the result of a demonstration at City Hall during which Mickey distributed thousands of whistles to demonstrators. Mickey was an early supporter of Special Olympics. A well-liked and respected leader in his field, he served on the Board of the Inter-Agency Council and a number of committees and commissioners panels. Mickey was a WWII veteran who served with the Coast Guard in the Philippines. Mickey's loss will be deeply felt by the Board of Directors and the staff of Lifespire whose lives he touched.
