        SHAPIRO -- Edna K. The Trustees, Administration, Faculty, Staff, and Alumni of Bank Street College of Education mourn the passing of Dr. Edna K. Shapiro, Distinguished Research Psychologist, Emerita. Dr. Shapiro joined the Research Division at the College in 1951, and served as a lead researcher and faculty member until her retirement in 1986. The author of numerous articles, she continued to be active in projects at Bank Street after her retirement. She co-edited, with faculty member Nancy Nager, a book on the history of progressive education and its evolution over time. ''Revisiting a Progressive Pedagogy: The Developmental-Interaction Approach'' was published by SUNY Press in 2000. Edna is greatly missed at Bank Street, and the entire College community extends its deeply felt condolences to her sons Saul and Daniel and to their families. A memorial honoring Edna and her work will be held at Bank Street on November 11, at 4 P.M.
