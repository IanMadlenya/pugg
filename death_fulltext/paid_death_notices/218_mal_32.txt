        GRUNWALD--Henry A. The Salzburg Easter Festival, through its American Friends, wishes to express deepest sympathy to the family of Henry Grunwald, a founding Board Member of AFSEF. His love of music and his love of life encouraged us all to look toward a future better than the past. We are grateful for his support, guidance and friendship. To Louise, the children and grandchildren, our fondest thoughts at this time. Harold Chumaceiro, Pres. American Friends of the Salzburg Easter Festival
