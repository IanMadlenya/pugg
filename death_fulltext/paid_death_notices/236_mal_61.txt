        KATZ--Abraham. The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center notes with great sadness the passing of its longstanding patron and friend, Abraham J. Katz. Mr. Katz loved classical music, particularly the art of chamber music. He possessed a thorough knowledge of its composers, its repertoire, and its performers. He demonstrated this love over many years through his generosity to the Chamber Music Society. He will be remembered by all of us for his loyal support of live performances and the gift of the finest grand piano for our concert stage. The wisdom, dignity, and great clarity of thought that characterized his every decision enabled our institution to thrive. We cherished his presence with us at concerts and missed him when he could no longer attend. We miss him now and remember him with great affection. We extend our sympathies to his wife Monica Pier Katz and his sons Peter, David, and Alexander.
