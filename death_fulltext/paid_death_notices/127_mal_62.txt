        SIMON-Sidney. The Boards of Trustees and Governors and the staff of the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture mourn the passing of the School's last surviving founder and its long-time friend, Sidney Simon. Sidney and three fellow artists founded the School in 1946. Sidney was a faculty member through the 1950's, served as the Director of the School from 1980-1983, and was an active member of Skowhegan's Board of Governors from 1962 to the present. Sidney's talent, wit, and dedication have helped shape Skowhegan's history. He will be deeply missed by everyone at the Skowhegan School. We send our condolences to his family.
        SIMON-Sidney. The Art Students League of New York deeply mourns the passing of sculptor Sidney Simon, an esteemed and beloved member of our faculty. He brought to us not only his vast knowledge, open mind and enormous talent, but also his wisdom, charm and wonderful sense of humor. He was a giving teacher with a generous spirit who cared deeply for not only the League, but for all that was art. We will miss you! We extend our heartfelt condolences to his family and to his many, many friends.
