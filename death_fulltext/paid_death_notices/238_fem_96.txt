        DINES--Ellen T. We mourn the death of our long-time trustee and very good friend, Ellen T. Dines. As an administrator in the New York City public school, Ellen Dines fought for the kind of education she felt that children deserved. She brought to our organization experience, intelligence, and wisdom, always expressed in a steady voice that made problems seem solvable. We will miss her warm and lovely manner.
