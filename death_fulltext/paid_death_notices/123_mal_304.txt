        BEYDA-Joseph D. Of all that we deem valuable accumulated over a lifetime, one of the most precious is a true friend. Joseph D. Beyda (A''H) was a friend, mentor, problem-solver and benefactor to all who knew him. His vision, wisdom and generosity were far reaching within and beyond our organization and community. He helped Jewish communities, institutions and individuals throughout the world. As President of Sephardic Bikur Holim from 1991 to 1995, he was a beacon of guiding light. Always growing, he became an instrument of growth for all of us. In his quest for excellence, he inspired us to excel. His profound kindness inspired passion. His boundless energy inspired enthusiasm. His generosity opened our hearts and his creativity opened our minds. His unique vision inspired us to dream. Carried by his greatness, we rose like the foam on an ocean wave. As President of Sephardic Bikur Holim, no hurt, problem or project was too small to address, no difficulty, crisis or project was too big for his insurrmountable determination and drive. He successfully lead Sephardic Bikur Holim in the re-settlement of over 2500 Jews from Syria. He instilled in our youth the importance of doing and giving to those less fortunate. Knowing that we are put on this earth to give, he used his resources, wide range of talents, unique gifts and abundant blessings to better the lives of all he touched. Although our lives are darkened by his passing, his light is not extinguished and continues to guide us. Cut down himself at an early age, his eternal vineyard of good deeds will bear fruit for generations to come. Our condolences to Barbara and all the children. From the Board of Directors, staff and volunteers of Sephardic Bikur Holim
