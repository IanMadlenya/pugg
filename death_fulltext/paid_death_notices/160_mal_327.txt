        BRILL-Robert. The American Jewish Committee is deeply saddened by the death of our dear friend, Bob Brill, who has been an integral part of the AJC family for more than three decades. Bob, a nephew of our former National PResident Elmer Winter, was a member of our national Board of Governors and a past President of our Milwaukee chapter. His wisdom, humor, and hands-on style made him not only a successful businessman, but a cherished and trusted civic leader in his home town and within the larger Jewish community. His desire to foster more positive and constructive intergroup relations inspired much of his professional and communal work, and will surely be one of his lasting legacies. We are greatful for Bob's generosity and his tireless commitment to AJC as we sought to build these human bridges of mutual respect and understanding together. We send our heartfelt condolences to his beloved wife, Marian, his three daughters, five grandchildren, and the rest of his grieving family. Bruce M. Ramer, President Jack Lapin, Chair, Board of Governors David A. Harris, Exec. Director Shulamith Bahat, Assoc Exec Dir
