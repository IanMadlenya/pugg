        LIQUORNIK-Chaim. We mourn the loss of a true Ba'al Chesed in the world of Jewish philanthropy and we extend heartfelt condolences to Rivka Liquornik and Sisel Klurman on the passing of their beloved husband and brother. Chaim personified the highest values of Jewish tradition and ethics and his outstretched hand of kindness made an invaluable contribution to the people of Jerusalem and Israel. A Patron of Medicine of the Medical Center, Mrs. Klurman selflessly devotes her time to the healthcare needs of the Jewish people. May the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Amer. Comm. for Shaare Zedek Jerusalem Med. Ctr.
