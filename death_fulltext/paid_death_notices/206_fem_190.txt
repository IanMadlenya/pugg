        FISHER--Grace S. Passed away on March 20, 2004, at the age of 57, after a brave struggle with pancreatic cancer. She was the loving daughter of the late Dr. Morris and Myrtle M. Fisher, the adored sister of Estelle Comay, and Susan, Frank, and Gordon Fisher, and their spouses, Dr. Bruce Rabin, Gary Schieneman, Lynn Fisher, Wesley Scott, and the late Sholom Comay. She was cherished by her brother-inlaw Joe Wasch and his wife Laurie, and sisters-in-law Barbara and Michelle Wasch. She doted on her nieces and nephews, Laura, Arthur, Reid, Joe, Todd, Samantha, Elyse, Adam and Hillary, as well as her grandnieces Morgan and Madeline, and her grandnephew Andy. She made her husband, Monte Wasch, happy and proud of her accomplishments for 34 wonderful years. She was loved and admired by her many cousins, as well as colleagues and friends. Her honesty and integrity, sense of humor, and passion for justice and common decency made her a role model for everyone who knew her. A gift to WAMC/Northeast Public Radio, PO Box 66600, Albany, NY 12206 (or at www.wamc. org) in her memory will help to keep her spirit alive. Services Monday, 9:45 am, at ''The Riverside,'' 76th St and Amsterdam. Burial at Beth Shalom Cemetery, Pittsburgh, PA, on Tuesday.
