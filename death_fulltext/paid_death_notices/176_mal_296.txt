        MURRAY-Archibald R. Fordham University and the Board of Trustees mourn the loss of our alumnus and colleague, Archibald R. Murray. A graduate of the Fordham School of Law, he applied his significant legal talents to serving the public interest throughout his career and most especially during his leadership of the Legal Aid Society. His service as a Trustee and Chair of the Board's Student Affairs Committee exemplified his characteristic commitment to Fordham University and the needs of its students. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Kay Crawford Murray, and their family. Paul B. Guenther Chair of the Board of Trustees Joseph A. O'Hare, S.J. President
