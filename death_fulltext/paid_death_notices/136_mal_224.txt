        HARRIS-Harold Leo, M.D. The officers, members and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) express profound sorrow at the loss of Dr. Harold Harris of Evanston, Ill. As a Technion Guardian, he demonstrated the highest level of commitment to the TechnionIsrael Institute of Technology, the ATS and Israel. He supported scholarships and a project to make the campus handicapped accessible, as well as teaching annually for many years at the Faculty of Medicine. He served as past president and chairman of the Chicago Chapter and on the National Board of Directors and Board of Regents. A passionate supporter of Israel, Dr. Harris often said that the highlight of his career was when he volunteered during the Yom Kippur War in the Burn Unit of the Israel Defense Forces. His lifetime commitment influenced his son, Ron, who endowed the Dr. Harold Leo Harris Academic Chair and the Margaret Mosenfelder Harris Academic Chair at the Technion in honor of his father and mother. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Dr. Harris' wife, Margaret, and the entire Harris family. American Society for TechnionIsrael Institute of Technology Irving A. Shepard, President Ben Z. Sosewitz, Chairman of the Board Melvyn H. Bloom, Executive Vice President Joel Rothman, Chicago Chapter President Jerold A.
