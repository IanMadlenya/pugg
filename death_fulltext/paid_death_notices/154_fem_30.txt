        FRIEDLAND-Dr. Beatrice L. The Yeshiva University family expresses profound sorrow on the passing of a longtime friend whose dedicated service to our Stern College for Women spanned five decades. As its first professor of biology; chair, biology department for 23 years; and, more recently, member, Board of Directors, she played a pivotal role in the College's creation and development. The University recognized her unique contributions by naming her professor emerita in 1978 and awarding her an honorary degree last year. The Beatrice Lashin Friedland Endowed Scholarship Fund was established at SCW in her honor by her son and daughter-in-law, Robert and Sheila Friedland. We extend our heartfelt condolences to children, Robert (and Sheila) Friedland, and Kenneth (and Jane) Friedland; grandchildren; and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University David S. Gottesman, Chairman Board of Trustees Lea Eisenberg, Chairman SCW Board of Directors
