        VIRGILIO-Lucille. December 14, 1917-November 27, 1997. Wife of the late Edward J. Virgilio. Survived by five children: Edward, Fredric (deceased), Peter, Ray (deceased) Martina; six grandchildren: Stephen, Ric, Rachel, Ray, Michelle. Lucille was born in Brooklyn, married Edward in 1938 and raised her five children in Brooklyn and then Queens. She was known for her generosity in many ways, always giving to her family and her community. She had many foster children, was a Den mother, Girl Scout Director and a volunteer worker in New York's Sloan-Kettering Hospital and The Foundling Hospital where she was given the award of ''Woman of the Year''. Her helping and giving did not stop in her later years. Both in East Hampton and Florida she helped many seniors enjoy the day by sharing slides of her world travels. She did this with a detailed narration. She truly enjoyed her six grandchildren, giving them memories to last forever. Ironically some of those memories are wonderful Thanksgiving weekends in East Hampton. Little did we know she would leave us on this 1997 Thanksgiving, but the word ''Thanksgiving'' does describe her perfectly. So if it was her time, the day itself says volumes about her. She will be missed in many ways, by many people, especially her family. Visitation Thursday 7-9 PM and Friday 2-4 and 7-9 at the Williams Funeral Home of East Hampton, 99 Newtown Lane, East Hampton, NY. Funeral Service Saturday 11 AM Most Holy Trinity RC Church, East Hampton. Interment of cremains following Parish Cemetery.
