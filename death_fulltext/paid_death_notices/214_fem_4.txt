        BENDHEIM--Bea, daughter of Ludwig and Steffi Bendheim, was born in 1918. She passed away peacefully in the Jewish Home in Rockleigh, N.J. on November 1, 2004. Bea grew up in her Jewish home in Nuernberg, Germany until her immigration in 1938 to the U.S.A. We had met in 1934 as teen-age students in Montreux, Switzerland, and I enjoyed her close, loyal friendship all these years. Bea was a practicing, professional baby-nurse for over 60 years. She was respected by hundreds of clients and served multi-generations within many families. Bea, fondly known as ''Auntie Bea'', was loved for her sparkling good sense of humor, her quick wit and a profound compassion for everyone. Lilo Goldenberg-Thurnauer
