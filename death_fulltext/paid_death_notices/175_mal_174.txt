        BARNETT-Henry L., M.D. the National Kidney Foundation of NY/ NJ, Inc. mourns the loss of our founding member and the first Chairman of our Medical Advisory Board. His presence and leadership was a sparkling light at a time when parents of children with Kidney Disease had no hope. Through his leadership and research, he developed new therapies which resulted in a better quality of life for children all over the world. He set the high standards for the specialty of Nephrology, of which he was one of the founders. We surely will miss him.
