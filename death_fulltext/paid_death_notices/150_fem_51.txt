        OESTREICH-Spo. In her 93rd year, passed away of natural causes Thursday night at her home in New York City. The widow of Charles H. Oestreich, she was also the cherished mother of David Oestreich, Joan Kend and the late Richard Oestreich, the adored grandmother of Debra Rubin, Elizabeth Fein and Caren Cohen, and the devoted great-grandmother of Henry, Charles, Catherine, William and Abigail. A graduate of Hunter College, a poet and an art collector, she was a brave and beautiful lady who will live in the hearts of her loving friends and family forever. May God grant her sweet repose.
