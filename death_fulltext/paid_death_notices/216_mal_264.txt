        WOLF--Greg. Our firm is in deep mourning over the death of Greg Wolf, the son of our beloved and adored Managing Director, George Wolf. For more than two years Greg has been battling leukemia with the resolve, confidence and strength of character that marks the noble warrior. All the while, he completed his studies with excellence so he could graduate with his '04 Duke class, and despite painful and seemingly endless treatments, including a bone marrow transplant, Greg maintained his keen sense of humor and adorably mischievous persona to the delight of his parents, five siblings, many friends and teams of doctors and nurses. We have never seen the likes of the love, devotion, caring, loving-kindness and bonhomie that each member of the Wolf Family showered on Greg and on each other throughout Greg's ordeal. Their example simply takes our breath away. Greg, you are our hero! ''Good night, sweet prince, and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!'' Everyone at Herrick, Feinstein LLP
