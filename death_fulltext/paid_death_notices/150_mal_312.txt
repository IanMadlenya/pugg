        SHOOMAN-Robert. The Neighborhood Cleaners Association International mourns the untimely death of our Director of Special Projects. Robert had just finished designing and teaching the first certification class to licensed dry cleaners when a tragic car accident took his life. His energy, enthusiasm and dedication to the work of the NCA-I was only surpassed by his joy of life, his warm heart and his good soul. He was a true friend to all who knew him.
