        GIBLIN-Denis R., M.D. The entire Beth Israel Medical Center family joins with the faculty and staff of The Alan and Barbara Merkin Department of Neurology in mourning the passing of Denis R. Giblin, MD, Professor of Neurology at The Albert Einstein College of Medicine (AECOM) and attending physician at BIMC. Dr. Giblin's contributions were considerable as a practitioner, mentor and teacher. He helped Beth Israel build a first rate clinical and teaching program which resulted recently in the establishment of the Denis R. Giblin Prize for Excellence in Teaching, which will be awarded annually to a graduating resident from the nurology training program at AECOM. We offer our heartfelt condolecnes to Susan Schwartz-Giblin and Dr. Giblin's entire family. Dr. Giblin's wisdom and experience will be missed by us all. Matthew E. Fink, MD, Pres & CEO Beth Israel Medical Center James S. Breslaw, MD, President of the Medical Board Susan B. Bressman, MD, Chairman, Alan and Barbara Merkin Department of Neurology
