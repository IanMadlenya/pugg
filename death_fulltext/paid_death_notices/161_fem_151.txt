        TROPPER-Yetta. Our heartfelt condolences to Rabbi Dr. Daniel Tropper, founder of Gesher, our Honorary President David Tropper, and the entire Tropper family on the passing of their beloved mother, wife, grandmother, greatgrandmother and sister. She was an extraordinary inspiration to all who knew her. May the family be comforted among the mourners of Zion. Philip Schatten, Chairman, Gesher Foundation
