        ABRAMOV-Dr. S. Zalman. The President, Chancellor, Boards of Governors and Overseers, faculty, administration and students of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion record with profound sorrow the death in Jerusalem of Dr. S. Zalman Abramov, Chairman of the Board of Overseers of our Jerusalem School. A generous benefactor of the College-Institute, Dr. Abramov, with his wife Ayala Zacks-Abramov endowed the S. Zalman and Ayala Abramov Library on the Jerusalem campus of HUC-JIR. An outstanding public servant and a former member of the Israeli Parliment, Dr. Abramov was a tireless champion of the cause of Liberal Judaism in Israel and a dedicated and faithful friend of HUC-JIR. May his memory be a blessing for us all. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife Ayala Zacks-Abramov, his children, grandchildren and great grandson. Rabbi Sheldon Zimmerman, President Burton Lehman, Chair, Board of Governors
