        KLAIMITZ-Miriam (nee Gross). Beloved wife of Jakob. Respected and loved mother of Heidi and Leni and her husband Mitchell Berg. Caring and loving grandmother to Alexander and Madeline. Sweet peace has come to her after so many brave battles. We shall always miss this remarkable person - her intelligence, humor, style and good nature.
