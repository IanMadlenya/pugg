        TUCK-Edward Hallam. The Drawing Center is deeply saddened by the loss of their distinguished Board member, Edward Tuck. Mr. Tuck had been a Board member since the founding of The Drawing Center in 1976. He also served as Chairman of the Board during the institution's first five critical years. Through his leadership, loyalty and impeccable judgement, he made immeasurable contributions to The Drawing Center, for which we will always be indebted. We extend our sympathies to his wife Lily, and to his entire family. Board of Directors & Staff The Drawing Center
