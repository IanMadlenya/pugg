        GOLDSTEIN-Neil. It is with profound sorrow that the partners, and staff of Konigsberg Wolf & Co., P.C. mourn the passing of their partner Neil Goldstein. Neil was a devoted member of our firm. He was a dear friend of many and he will be sorely missed. To his wife, Amy, and family we extend our heartfelt sympathy.
