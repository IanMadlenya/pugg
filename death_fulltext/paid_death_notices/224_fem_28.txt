        MacNAIR--Susan. 1939-2005 The soul of generosity, kindness and warmth, Susan MacNair died on August 31, 2005 after an extended illness. Sue spent most of her adult life in the theatre and film worlds, working closely with such giants as Mike Nichols, Nora Ephron, Edward Vilella, Lauren Bacall and the late Michael Bennett. She served in various production capacities on Mike Nichols' DEATH AND THE MAIDEN, SOCIAL SECURITY and HURLYBURLY, and on the Michael Bennett musicals, SEESAW, A CHORUS LINE and BALLROOM, winning a Tony nomination as a producer of BALLROOM. Her film credits include Monte Hellman's TWO-LANE BLACKTOP and Mike Nichols' SILKWOOD, HEARTBURN, REGARDING HENRY, GILDA RADNER, POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE and WORKING GIRL. Sue had an adventurous spirit and loved more than anything to cook for and travel with her husband, Artie Sicardi. Her family and friends will miss her deeply and wonder how, without Sue's help and guidance, they will know what restaurants to eat at in Rome, where to stay in Maine, where to find the best cheese, pastries, lobsters, bagels, lox and unconditional emotional support. Sue is survived by, her husband, Artie, and Artie's family-Artie, Jr., Drew, Laurie, Melanie and Cody--her mother, Hilda MacNair, and her brother, Duke MacNair, and Duke's family -his wife, Gayle, his son, J.D., and J.D.'s son, Houston. The family will have a private funeral with a memorial service to be announced at a future date. At Sue and Artie's request, please send any gift to Columbia University Lung Cancer Research Fund, in care of Mark B. Stoopler, M.D., 161 Ft. Washington Avenue, New York, NY 10032.
