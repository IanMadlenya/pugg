        NEAMAN-Cecilia. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society express profound sorrow at the loss of Cecilia Neaman of New York City and Oceanside, CA. Together with her husband, Sam, she was a legendary supporter of the American Technion Society, the Technion and Israel. They founded the Samuel Neaman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the Technion, the leading ''think tank'' in the Middle East. An interdisciplinary institute, it searches for solutions to significant Israeli public policy problems through advanced research, workshops and publications. As Technion Guardians, Cecilia and Sam demonstrated the highest level of commitment for the Technion. Admired and loved by many, Cecilia was a master of the ''art of living,'' living every day with creativity and passion. She affected the lives of many who will sorely miss her vibrant presence. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Sam Neaman. American Society for TechnionIsrael Institute of Technology Lawrence S. Jackier, President Irving A. Shepard, Chairman Melvyn H. Bloom, Exec Vice Pres Dr. Andrew Viterbi, San Diego Chapter Chair Robert Blumberg, San Diego Chapter President Gary Leo, Vice President Western Region
