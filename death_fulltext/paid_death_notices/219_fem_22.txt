        BURTON--Deena Elise, PhD, age 56. Our wonderful Deena lost the struggle with her vicious Cancer and died Sunday, April 3. Deena received her BA from the Univ. of Wisconsin, an MA in Arts Administration from Columbia and subsequently an MA and PhD in Perfomance Art from NYU. She taught theatre arts at the Eugene Lang College of The New School. Deena's passion was Indonesian dance. Many thanks to the arts community and the Indonesian Consulate for the performances and tribute in her honor on Feb 5. We are grateful to her many friends, colleagues and students who were so devoted and supportive throughout the ordeal. Our special appreciation for the help from the Frank and Sperling families. Deena is survived by her mother, Bebe Soloway, her husband Skip LaPlante, her son Roan LaPlante and a half brother Richard Burton of California. Cremation is private and a memorial is planned. Skip and Bebe will be receiving in Queens. Please call.
