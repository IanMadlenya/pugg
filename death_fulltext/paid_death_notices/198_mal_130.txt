        NOVACK--Rabbi Julius. Congregation Hope of Israel and its Sisterhood sadly note the passing of our esteemed Rabbi, spiritual leader and mentor. For over 30 years, Rabbi Novack, a brilliant student of the learned Rabbi David Leibowitz, labored tirelessly to maintain the vitality of our daily minyons, festivals and sabbath services. He devoted his life to enriching congregations, yeshivas and nursing homes in Brooklyn, Manhattan and the Bronx. He will be dearly missed by our congregation, his family, and his loving wife Judith. >>AD#
