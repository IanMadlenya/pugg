        ALVAREZ - Ernesto. The Board of Trustees and Staff of Casita Maria, the oldest settlement house in New York serving the Hispanic communities of the South Bronx and East Harlem, are deeply saddened by the sudden loss of their esteemed colleague and fellow Trustee, Ernesto Alvarez. His longtime and steadfast devotion to Casita Maria was exemplary. His warmth, wit and creativity will be sorely missed by all who knew him.
