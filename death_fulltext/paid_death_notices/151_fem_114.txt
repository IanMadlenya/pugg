        LICHTENDORF-Susan Rae (Siegel). On August 11, 1999, at age 58. Beloved wife of Arthur. Loving mother of Victoria. Caring sister of Richard, devoted daughter of the late Harry & Mildred Siegel. Susan, contrary to her small stature, displayed enormous talent and tremendous courage. A progressive voice for women's health issues, she also mastered art history, Dickens, scientific journalism and all seven continents. A peerless parent and partner, she stood out in our unruly metropolis for solid old-fashioned strength of character.
