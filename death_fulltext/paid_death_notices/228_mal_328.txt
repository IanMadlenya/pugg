        WORGUL--Basil Vladimir. Passed away January 19, 2006. A Professor for Radiation Biology in Radiology and Ophthalmology at Columbia University which he joined in 1974, he received his B.S. at University Miami (Biology) and his Ph.D. at University Vermont (Cell Biology). He defined the mechanism of radiation cataract development; discovered the ''Terminal body''--a cellular organelle; described the preferred dynamic reorientation of the mitotic spindle; the cataractotoxic load theory, and the current classification of congenital cataracts. His work on low dose radiation effects led to the adjustment of radiation protection levels. A brilliant thinker and inspiring researcher with the gift to bring about the excitement of science, conveying independent thought and creativity, he was a fascinating lecturer, engaging, entertaining and convincing. Born June 30, 1947, in New York, his favorite city on earth, he was a budding scientist early on, but also a poet, an artist, an astronomer, his interests seemed unlimited. Basil loved language and was an avid reader of fiction, non-fiction and his beloved New York Times. If his sense for fair conduct was violated, he spoke up regardless of personal consequences. Basil was our ever loving and caring son, husband, companion father, grandfather, and brother. He was our best friend and the first to turn to--he always took the time to listen and help. We know him for his thoughtfulness and concern, and his never resting intend to make us smile, to comfort us when we were hurt, to advise if we were lost, and to embrace and protect us with his love. He left too soon and will always live on in our memory. Stephanie, Kathy, Anna, Ronald, Michael, Suzanne, Dan, Holly, Ryan, Vito, John
