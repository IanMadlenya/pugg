        BOTWINICK-Bessie. The officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Bessie Botwinick, beloved mother of Elaine Wolfensohn and a cherished friend of UJA-Federation. Bessie and her late husband, Benjamin, expressed their devotion to the Jewish community in countless ways, both in New York and in Israel. Their legacy continues through the exceptional philanthropy of Elaine and her husband, James, and their children, Sara, Naomi, and Adam. Sara actively supports UJA - Federation's mission through the Jewish Leadership Forum. We extend our deepest sympathy to the Botwinick and Wolfensohn families. Larry Zicklin, President Morris W. Offit, Chair of the Board John S. Ruskay, Exec. V.P. & C.E.O.
