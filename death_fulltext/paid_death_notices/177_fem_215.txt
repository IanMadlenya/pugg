        SESINOVA-Alena. On Sept. 11th, 2001 in the WTC. Taken from us physically but not spiritually. She will live on forever in our hearts and in our minds. Alena was an avid reader with a sharp intellect. She knew more and cared more about America than most natural born citizens. Alena's love for freedom prompted her courageous flight from communist Czechoslovakia & for 30 years she lived the American dream. She lived her life as a hero and died a hero. I will always cherish our friendship, love & life we shared. Alena is survived by her 2 cats, loving companion, many friends and a mother and brother still residing in the Czech Republic. Donations can be made in her name to The Humane Society. Memorial Service will take place on Oct. 27th at 6PM at Hampton Cares, 109 W. 27th St, NYC, 3rd floor. Barbara Cattano.
