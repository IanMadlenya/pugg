        TSIEN-Kia Kwei. Beloved father of Dawn Tsien, devoted husband of the late Lois Ing Tsien, and loving brother of Lily Sze, Daisy Shih and Maud Chow, passed away peacefully at the Mt. Sinai Medical Center on June 8, 2001 from complications arising from a fall. Born in Beijing, China on July 27, 1918, he became one of the earliest members of the Secretariat of the United Nations, starting out as a translator and rising to the post of Deputy Assistant Administrator of the U.N. Development Programme. In this capacity he served the U.N. and many nations of the world with tireless effort, impeccable tolerance and profound respect for all cultures. He was mentor to a host of younger colleagues at the U.N. He will be missed most for his modesty, his erudition and his generosity to all. A memorial service will be held at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel on Saturday, June 23rd, at 11:30 A.M. In lieu of flowers, donations in his name may be made to Trees for the Future.
