        LARRABEE - DOERMANN - Elea nor, AIA. The members of the American Institute of Architects New York Chapter, mourn the death of our colleague Eleanor Doermann Larrabee. A member of the AIA New York Chapter Architecture Dialogue Committee. She was devoted to the well being of the community and its architecture. A graduate of Radcliffe College and Columbia University, a Trustee of Barnard College, a member of the Alliance of Women in Architecture, she had an abiding concern for knowledge and education, which was manifest in her distinguished work for more than four decades as an architect, and leader in the planning and design of libraries for colleges and universities. One of her libraries was hailed as ''a national model of urban community colleges preparing its non traditional student body for the cultural and economic mainstream.''
