        HOWELL-Betsy (Mrs. J. Taylor). It is with sadness that the Goddard Riverside Community Center acknowledges the passing of our longtime Board member. She served with diligence and devotion in every phase of our community work with particular emphasis on our Creative Arts programs. Betsy was an inspiration and joy to all of us. Elaine Postley, Pres. Bernard J. Wohl, Exec. Dir.
