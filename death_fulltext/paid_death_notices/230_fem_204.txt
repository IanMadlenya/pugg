        CALDWELL--Sarah. The Metropolitan Opera deeply mourns the death of our dear friend and colleague, conductor Sarah Caldwell. The first woman ever to conduct at the Met, she was not only a trail blazer, but made an incalculable contribution to opera in this country. Her probing intelligence, ready wit, and seemingly boundless energy will be sorely missed. Joseph Volpe, Gen. Mgr. James Levine, Music Dir.
