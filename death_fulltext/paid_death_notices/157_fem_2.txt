        CLARK-Anna. The Board of Directors and members of the Women's City Club of New York mourn the passing of our beloved member, Anna Holbrook Clark, and we send our deepest sympathy to her family. Anna joined the WCC in 1926 and in 1986 she was honored by us for her outstanding dedication to New York City and the WCC. A third generation member, her contributions toward many of our policy initiatives, including charter reform, transportation and government operations, were unparalleled. Elizabeth Lubetkin Lipton, Pres. Women's City Club of New York
