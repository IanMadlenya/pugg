        KEPES--Dr. Edith, Professor Emeritus of Anesthesiology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, died at the age of 92. Born in Hungary, she received her medical degree in Vienna, Austria and fled to England at the beginning of WWII; during the Blitz, she worked as a midwife until she was accepted as a physician. She chose anesthesiology as her specialty, emigrating to the U.S. in 1946. In 1951 she joined the staff of Montefiore Hospital as Chief of the Anesthesiology Department. She was a pioneer in the treatment of chronic pain, starting the first pain center in the tristate area which became the model for the centers throughout the U.S. The Academy of Medicine, on the occasion of her 90th birthday, honored her for her substantial professional accomplishments. She molded generations of young doctors. Her approach to life and medicine was an inspiration to all those lucky enough to be her students. Her love of art and culture inspired her to travel and study well into her late 80's. She took up sculpting as a hobby, winning several awards. As an example of her unique spirit, in 1955 as a widow, she adopted a baby, embodying the idea of a modern woman. She is survived by her daughter, Judy, son-inlaw, Jeff, two granddaughters, Sasha and Alana, and her dearly loved sister, Alice Pless.
