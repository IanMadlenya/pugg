        WILLIAMS-David. The Board of Directors, staff, & volunteers of God's Love We Deliver are saddened by the loss of David Williams, dearly loved father of Vaughn C. Williams, our valued Board member. As a lawyer and then as both a state and federal judge, he was a champion for justice his entire life & enriched the lives of those who knew him. Through his dedication to the principle of equal justice for all, he made a difference in the lives of thousands of Americans throughout his career. We extend our deepest condolences to Vaughn & the entire Williams family, as well as his many friends & colleagues.
