        JESSELSON-Ludwig. On the occasion of the fifth yahrzeit of Ludwig Jesselson, of blessed memory, we remember this extraordinary and humble man whose very being radiated kindness, dignity and modesty. A captain of industry, he viewed his charitable activities, undertaken with his wife and partner Erica, as strengthening the future of Israel and K'lal Yisrael. Surely his leadership and patronage of so many vital organizations helped to shape the history of the Jewish People in our generation. As a devoted benefactor and friend of Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Luddy was a true visionary and leader par excellence. Together with Erica, they made the dream of a comprehensive heart institute a reality. The Jesselson Heart Center has developed an international reputation for state-of-the-art medical excellence and compassionate care. As the beneficiaries of his wise counsel and guidance we miss him dearly. American Committee and International Board of Governors Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem
