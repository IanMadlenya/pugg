        ROEMER -- Ruth J. (nee Rosenbaum). On August 1, 2005 after a short illness, at age 89. After receiving her law degree from Cornell in 1939, she represented the United Electrical Workers (UE) in Washington during the 1940s, later moving into the field of health law, and over the past 50 years did important work on hospital patients' rights and admissions laws, water fluoridation, abortion and reproductive rights legislation, and health manpower law. She initiated what later became the international Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, adopted by the WHO in 2003, served as president of the APHA and was professor emerita at the School of Public Health at UCLA. These accomplishments comprised but a small part of the person she was: a loving mother and grandmother, Ruth also mentored scores of students and friends, often redirecting their careers. Her dinner parties, co-hosted for many years with her husband and collaborator Milton, who died in 2001, were legendary, and continued until her death. She leaves a son, John, of New York City, a daughter, Beth, of Berkeley, a daughter-inlaw Natasha, six grandchildren, two great grandchildren, a sister Hilda Kahne, and a large extended family. Contributions in her memory may be made to the Ruth Roemer Scholarship Fund at the UCLA School of Public Health, Box 951772, Los Angeles, CA. 90095.
