        MORIARTY-Patrick J., CSW. The NYC Chapter, National Assoc. of Social Workers mourns the loss of our long-time member, colleague, & friend. He was the consummate social worker, with an exquisite sense of principle, purpose and spirituality: he touched people at their deepest level. The core of his existence was to serve others, and in doing so, he made a difference to so many. As an older person living with AIDS, he confronted and lived his life with courage & grace. We are grateful for his example and privileged to have known him. Memorial service Wed., November 19, 6:15 PM, Holy Trinity RC Church, 213 West 82 Street, NYC. Robert Schachter, DSW, Exec. Dir. Carmen Hendricks, DSW, Pres.
