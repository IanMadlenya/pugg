        FISCHBACH--Marilyn C. The associates and the artists of Fischbach Gallery are extremely saddened by the passing of Marilyn C. Fischbach who died in Paris on June 15th. Marilyn Fischbach, a vibrant art dealer, had the courage to recognize and present young talent. She founded the gallery in 1960, and exhibited the work of many important artists including Eva Hesse, Ronald Bladen, Alex Katz, Robert Mangold, Robert Ryman, Jane Freilicher, and Leigh Behnke. Her unique vision continues to nurture the gallery today. We extend our most heartfelt condolences to her husband, Herbert, her children, Peter, John, Sally and Jimmy, her sister, Sheila, and her entire family. >>AD#
