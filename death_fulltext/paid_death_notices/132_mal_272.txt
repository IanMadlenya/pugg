        VINITSKY-Chaim. The Officers, Trustees and Staff of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee express their deep sorrow at the loss of Chaim Vinitsky, known as ''Mr. Israel'' by so many JDC, UJA, and top Federation leaders. A man of warmth, decency and caring, he labored valiantly for the unity of the Jewish people. His love of Israel was contagious. He will be missed. Condolences to his widow, Pnina, and family.
