        PERERA-George A., M.D., Med. Sc.D. The Department of Medicine notes with sadness the passing on September 14th of Dr. George A. Perera at the age of 91. Dr. Perera graduated from Princeton College in 1933 and from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1937. Following a chief residency in Medicine at the Presbyterian Hospital, Dr. Perera joined the Columbia Univeristy faculty and the Presbyterian Hospital staff. He served both University and Hospital with distinction until his departure in 1971. He was highly regarded as an expert in the field of hypertension, his work having been recognized by election to both the American Society for Clinical Investigation and the Association of American Physicians, and Columbia University awarded him its Alumni Medal in 1980. As a Professor of Medicine and as Associate Dean of the College of Physicians and Surgeons he guided more than a generation of medical students with wisdom, energy, and dedication. We express our enduring gratitude for his many contributions. Joseph Tenenbaum, M.D. Interim Chairman, Department of Medicine Columbia University
