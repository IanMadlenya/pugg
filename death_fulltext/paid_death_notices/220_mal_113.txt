        WASSER--Adolph, grieving the recent loss of Sylvia, his beloved wife of 56 years, died Sunday, May 8, at age 84. Beloved father of Steven (Stephanie) and Daniel (Marcia) and grandfather of Jacqueline, Merrill, Maddie, Caryn and Melissa. He was a leader in the field of Jewish social work, serving as executive director of the Central Queens Y for 35 years and cofounding the Central Nassau Y. A man of gentle strength and intellectual vigor, he was blessed with devoted and loving family and friends.
        WASSER--Adolph E. The Board, Staff and Members of the Central Queens YM & YWHA mourn the loss of our revered Executive Director Emeritus, Adolph E. (Adi) Wasser. Adi was director of the Y, and its predecessor in East New York for 34 years. During his tenure, he helped build two community buildings and brought into operation Camp Edward Isaacs. He taught a generation of professionals their craft, and guided Board members in their responsibilities. He is predeceased by Sylvia, his beloved wife of 56 years. Our hearts go out to sons Steven & Daniel, their wives Stephanie and Marcia, and granddaughters Jacqueline, Merrill, Maddie, Caryn, and Melissa. May they be comforted among the mourners of Jerusalem, and may Adi's memory be as a blessing in all our lives. Shep Porter, President David E. Posner, Executive Director Central Queens YM & YWHA
