        BERNSTEIN--Leonard. At age 73, at home in New York City, surrounded by his books and pictures and reminders of his years of travel. The most loving and generous of men to Carol Schoen, his beloved companion, his dear nephew David Bernstein, David's wife Nirit, their children, Alon & Matan & to his friends and extended family, he had a gift for happiness and for transmitting it to others. He retired 15 years ago from Lehman College where he taught English. For the last five years he was an enthusiastic member of the Institute for Retired Professionals at The New School. His death is a profound loss to the many people who loved him. Services will be held on Thursday May 4 at 11:15AM, Riverside Memorial Chapel, 76th Street and Amsterdam Ave., NYC.
