        WARD--Samuel Stuart. On September 23, 2003. Sam died peacefully at home following an accident in a taxicab. The son of the late Jennifer Ward and James Ward and the brother of Lea Ward, Sam would have been 41 years old on October 6. His life was filled with love, concern and care for others. In spite of his modest view of himself, he showed great strength in the face of challenge, and delighted us with his bright and sardonic sense of humor. Sam is also survived by his many friends, among them Katie, George, Jarred and Ronnie, and Sam's crazy cats, Virgil, Vindra and Broadway, who are probably pretty darned angry at being left behind (but are now in a good home). In lieu of flowers donations may be may be made in his name to the Humane Society of New York, 306 East 59th St., NY, NY 10022. A Memorial Service will be held at 2:30 PM on Sunday, October 12, 2003, at the Church of the Epiphany, York Avenue and 74th Street, followed by a reception at the church.
