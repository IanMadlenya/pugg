        MILLER - Robert Myles. Dear Rob, our friendship began on September 5, 1933, and saw no interruption until last Thursday. Your concern and encouragement for me had no peer. Unselfishness or self-promotion were not part of your repertoire. Whether it was lunch at The Friars Club or a ride in your boat on Candlewood Lake-the event was a special occasion. You founded the Lee Myles Advertising Agency and by your originality and creativity, the world knew more about Pete Seger and other folk singers through Folkways Records. Your absolute dedication to others will never be forgotten Art Aaron J. Marcus, M.D.
