        SOKOLOW--Arthur D. Age 77, passed away peacefully at his Riverdale, N.Y. home on March 2, 2006. Beloved brother of Martin Sokolow and the late Ruth White and great friend of Jane Genth. A graduate of Horace Mann School and Colorado College, he served as a 1st Lieutenant in the 45th Infantry Division in the Korean War, and later worked as a financial and real-estate professional in Arkansas and New York. A gourmet cook and opera lover, Arthur was unfailingly kind, courageous, loyal, and hilarious--with a runaway laugh that his many friends will remember and miss. A memorial will be held in the spring. Donations may be made to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, NY, NY 10021.
