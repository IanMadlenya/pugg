        TAISHOFF-Ruth Saltzman. I am deeply saddened and mourn the passing of my dear friend for over 35 years and then the joy of having her become family as the wife, for too short a period, because of the death of my loving brother Gilbert. My husband Charles, family and I will always cherish having had Ruth to share in our lives. I will forever remember and be grateful for the blessing of our mutual concern and love.
