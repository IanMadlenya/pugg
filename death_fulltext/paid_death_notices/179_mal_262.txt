        HUMPHREYS-George H., II, M.D. The Boards, Faculty, and Staff of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons are deeply saddened by the passing of Dr. George H. Humphreys II. From 1946 to 1969, Dr. Humphreys was Attending Surgeon and Director of the Surgical Service at The Presbyterian Hospital in the City of New York, and Valentine Mott Professor of Surgery and Chairman of the Department of Surgery at the College of Physicians & Surgeons. He led the Department of Surgery through a period of growth and achievement, and was among the first to perform several procedures of pediatric and thoracic surgery, a field in which he had a special interest. Born in New York City in 1903, he was educated at Harvard College, Harvard Medical School, and the College of Physicians & Surgeons, and began his career at the Hospital as an intern in 1930. He was a beloved surgeon, who trained generations of the nation's leading surgeons and professors of surgery. We extend our deepest condolences to his family.

Fischbach, M.D. Executive Vice President for Health and Biomedical Sciences Dean of the Faculty of Medicine Columbia University
