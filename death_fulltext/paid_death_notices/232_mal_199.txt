From Nursery Years to the Grasshopper of Lower School to Middle School to your leadership in the Upper School, you excelled in every way. You taught us how to love, to learn and live life to the fullest. As Valedictorian in June, 2004, you said to us ''Live for this moment; the past is present now.'' Alex, you will always be in our present--today and forever. Our hearts are with Karen, Jacques and Katherine.
