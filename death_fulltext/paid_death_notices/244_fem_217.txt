        GRASS--Louise. American Friends of The Hebrew University (AFHU) and The Hebrew University of Jerusalem mourn the passing of our cherished friend Louise Grass. A dedicated humanitarian known for her work on behalf of Israel, the Jewish people and the cause of higher education, Louise Grass, along with her beloved husband Alex, maintained a longstanding commitment to advancing human progress in myriad ways. Louise and Alex Grass, a former Chairman of the Board of Governors of The Hebrew University and an Honorary Vice President of AFHU, enhanced the University's intellectual growth and international stature in ways that have benefited Israel's people and humanity. Collectively and individually, the Grasses have made the world a better place. We extend our profound sympathies to Alex and the entire Grass family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. The Hebrew University of Jerusalem Prof. Menachem Magidor, President AFHU Ira Lee Sorkin, Chairman George A. Schieren, Pres. Peter T. Willner, National Exec. Dir.
