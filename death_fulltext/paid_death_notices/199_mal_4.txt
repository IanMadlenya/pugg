        PAPP--Steven. The faculty, staff and students at Columbia University Health Sciences mourn the loss of our friend and colleague, Steven Papp. For the past 25 years, Steven was Deputy Director for Administration at NY State Psychiatric Institute and Associate Vice President in the Faculty of Medicine at Columbia University. Steven brought a wealth of knowledge and experience to both Columbia and the Psychiatric Institute. He was at once a world class administrator, a leader, a mentor, and most importantly, a friend. We extend our deepest sympathies to his family and friends. He will be deeply missed. Gerald D. Fischbach, M.D., Exec Vice President & Dean, Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons
