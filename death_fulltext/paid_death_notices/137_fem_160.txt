        CARDINALI-Mary T. (nee Russo). On June 16, 1998. Wife of the late Louis. Cherished mother of Barbara. Loving mother-in-law and confidante of Morton Toffler. Dear step-grandmother of Elise and Hilton. Beloved sister of Josephine Swanson, fond aunt of Edwin and Roger Swanson, and Rudolph and Robert Russo. Pre-deceased by sisters Pasqualina Frazette, Rose Romano & brother Michael Russo. A lifelong resident of Greenwich Village, Mary was a lovely, energetic, enthusiastic, vibrant woman, affectionately referred to by some friends as the ''Flower Lady'' since her husband was the owner of a well known, long established Village flower shop on Bleecker Street. Courageous in the face of daunting obstacles, thereby heightening her sensitivity to the pain in others, she left priceless legacies of love, compassion, caring words and actions, all done with a gentle heart. She demonstrated these acts many, many times, always ready to help another, whether family, friend, or even stranger. If she could help, she would. Honest, faithful & wise, she would listen intently &, most important, without criticism, before giving counsel. Mary had dark, sparkling eyes, with a true zest for living, & a spontaneous, genuine, sunny smile, radiating joy, warmth and merriment, which proved to be healing to others. She brought light to many with her generosity of spirit. We were so blessed to have known her, and it was our privilege to be her daughter and son-in-law. She will be forever cherished in our memories, and we will continue to be enriched by her inspiration in our lives. Memories are the treasures of the heart and balm for the soul.
