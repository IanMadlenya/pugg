        BLUM-Loretta, well-known Dallas fashion retailer, passed away August 23 after a brief illness. Loretta was highly respected throughout the fashion industry, both in the United States and Europe, for her innovative sense of style. She attended Ohio State University and Tobe Coburn in New York City. After graduation, she became a buyer for Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman-Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue. In 1975, she returned to Dallas to open her own women's specialty shops featuring many new American and French designers. She was still dressing the fashion-conscious ladies of Dallas at the time of her death. A celebration of her life is planned for a date to be announced.
