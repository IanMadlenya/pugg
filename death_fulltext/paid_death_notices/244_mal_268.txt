        COLTEN--Harvey R. M.D., was an esteemed colleague who contributed to Columbia University Medical Center in immeasurable ways during his time as vice president and professor of pediatrics. In administering our research and academic programs as CUMC vice president, Dr. Colten added value to our research infrastructure and refined our criteria for faculty appointments, promotions, and searches. His role at Columbia followed a long successful career in patient care, education, and research at some of our country's leading academic health sciences institutions. He served as dean of Northwestern University's medical school, chairman of pediatrics at Washington University's medical school, clinical professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco, professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, director of the cystic fibrosis program at Children's Hospital in Boston, and an NIH researcher. We were honored to benefit from the scientific acumen, boundless energy, and interdisciplinary wisdom that made Dr. Colten one of academic medicine's best. We offer our condolences to his family.
