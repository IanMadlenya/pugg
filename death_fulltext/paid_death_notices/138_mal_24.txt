        CAPECCHI-Renato. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of our friend and colleague, Renato Capecchi. His Met career spanned forty-three years and encompassed a wide variety of roles. We will remember him especially for his many fine comic interpretations, but also for his personal charm and thorough professionalism. We offer our sincerest condolences to his family and friends.
