        GROSS--Jerome B. Merrill Lynch mourns the passing on December 12 of Jerry Gross, whose 59-year career at Merrill Lynch took him from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange to a seat on the firm's board of directors. Jerry loved his work and loved to help others. He was a friend to all, and his colleagues and clients were like family to him. A veteran of World War II, he began his Merrill Lynch career on September 20, 1946, as an account executive in the sales office at 70 Pine Street. In 1951, he was recalled to the Army during the Korean War and returned to the firm 18 months later. In 1966 he was named head floor broker on the floor of the American Stock Exchange and that same year was elected to the board of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. Nine years later, he was appointed head floor broker for all of the firms' brokers on the floors of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the CBOE, as well as the Midwest, Pacific Coast and Philadelphia Stock Exchanges. A piano player, jazz lover and Yankees fan, he kept himself in good shape by playing singles tennis three times a week and walking everywhere. He worked nearly to the end, making the walk to his office on 53rd Street daily from his home on 57th Street. He is survived by his wife, Barbara - Ruth Thackston Gross; and three daughters by his first wife Alexandra: Marjorie Steinman, of Albany; Jill Gross-Marks, of Manhattan and Ellen Gross Polkes, of Scarsdale. Funeral services will be held on Friday, December 16, at 9:30 a.m., at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Ave. at 81st St.
