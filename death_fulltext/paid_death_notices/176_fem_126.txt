Until retirement, she taught social studies and history for many years chiefly in Brooklyn high schools. Helen loved opera, music, theater, reading and travel. Among her lifelong relationships were her friendships with Florence Nelson and Pearl Wolfert. The eldest in a close family, she actively served as mentor to 2 surviving sisters and a brother; they will miss her practical insights and her deep-seated curiosity about current events and ongoing cultural programs. A private memorial service is scheduled for 1:30 PM, Sunday, September 23, in her former apartment.
