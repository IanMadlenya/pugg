        RAMOS-Paul. It is with profound sorrow that the Board and staff of the AIDS Service Center of Lower Manhattan mourn the loss of our beloved Board Chair, Paul Ramos. He was a staunch advocate, a powerful, compassionate, wise and giving man. As a founding Board member of ASC and fearless leader of the Betances Health Unit, Paul led with authority and respect, and was an inspiration to all. He will forever remain a guiding force in our lives. Heartfelt condolences to Roni and all of Paul's family and the staff and Board of Betances.
