        FIUME--Sarah. It is with heartfelt sorrow that we record the passing of our esteemed colleague. A dedicated member of the Board of Directors of the Sephardic Nursing and Rehabilitation Center and past president of the Ladies Auxiliary (LASHA). For many years Sarah gave of herself with great devotion on behalf of our elderly residence. She chaired many successful fund raising events, including LASHA weekends. We extend our deepest sympathy to her daughter, Valerie Fiume, son Daryl and Gayle, grandchildren, Shane, Spencer, Samantha, Steven and Lisa and great granddaughter Layla.
