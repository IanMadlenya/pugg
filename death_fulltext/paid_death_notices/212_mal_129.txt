        THOMPSON -- Arthur. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of baritone Arthur Thompson, a distinguished artist and wonderful colleague. In a Met career spanning a quarter century, he sang more than 300 performances of 26 roles. We extend our deepest sympathies to his many friends. Joseph Volpe, General Mgr James Levine, Music Dir.
