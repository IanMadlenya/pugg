        HILL--Marcia. Boca Raton, FL died peacefully on December 11, 2004, her family at her side after a long and courageous three year battle. She is survived by her beloved husband of 43 years, Robert Anthony, and her loving children Mardi, Karen, Wendy, Gina, Bob, and Gary. Devoted mother-in-law of Chris Kane, Howard Katz, Amy Hill, and Kathryn Hill. Adoring grandmother of Gavin, Lauren, Sophia, Michael, Emma, Megan, and Aidan. Marcia was a wonderful, devoted elementary school teacher for 20 years in Northport, L.I. While teaching, she earned the degree of Master of Science from L.I.U. She and her husband raised their family in Huntington, L.I. Thereafter, they resided at Boca West Country Club for many years. She will be missed by all her friends; especially her tennis group to whom she was known as Ms. Boca West. Marcia's love of art, books, theater, opera, and music motivated her entire family. She was a remarkable woman by any measure. Though she will be missed dearly, her love will live on with us forever. Plans for a joyous celebration of her life will be announced later.
