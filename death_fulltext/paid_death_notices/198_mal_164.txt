A graduate of Choate (1954), Brown University (1958), and Columbia Law School (1966), Richard Seid moved to Mexico in 1972 following his marriage to Maria Victoria Llamas, a Mexican writer and broadcast journalist. There, he became a wellknown English-language columnist. Over the years, his opinion pieces and columns were published in the ''Christian Science Monitor,'' ''The News of Mexico City,'' and ''The Mexico City Times.''

Over the years he monitored presidential elections to guard against electoral fraud, worked on his wife's congressional campaign, and was active in many civic and human rights groups. In addition to his political activism, he taught such courses as Speech, Ethics, and Critical Thinking at the Mexico City campus of Massachusetts - based Endicott College, and continued to practice law at Goodrich, Riquelme y Asociados. He also was a champion table-tennis player. He is survived by his wife Maria Victoria Llamas de Seid, his children Alan and Marivi, his mother Shirley Seid and his brother John Seid. His father, a New York attorney, Herman Seid, died in 1984. >>AD#
