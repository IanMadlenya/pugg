        GROSSMAN--Dr. William. The members of the New Jersey Psychoanalytic Society mourn the abrupt and premature passing of our beloved colleague, Dr. William Grossman. It is hard to imagine our psychoanalytic lives without his remarkable presence. He was a brilliant thinker, a generous friend, a majestic man. Although gone, he will live on in all of us. Gisela Zerykier, M.D., President New Jersey Psychonanalytic Society
