        KAHN-Melvin, M.D. The Trustees, Faculty and Staff of Mount Sinai School of Medicine and The Mount Sinai Hospital of Mount Sinai NYU Health mourn the passing of our distinguished colleague, Melvin Kahn, M.D., Clinical Professor in the Samuel Bronfman Department of Medicine, who was associated with Mount Sinai for more than 45 years. Dr. Kahn joined Mount Sinai as an intern in 1953, after receiving his medical degree from Tulane University. He served at the Bronx Veterans Affairs Medical Center, then in the United States Air Force, and returned to Mount Sinai as a Fellow in cardiology. He joined the Attending Staff of The Mount Sinai Hospital in 1959, and was appointed to the faculty of the School of Medicine upon its establishment in 1968. He was admired as both teacher and clinician for his dedication to students and patients. He will be remembered most fondly, and he will be sorely missed. We extend our sincere sympathy to his wife, Barbro, to his sons Jonathan and Mark, to his grandson and to the entire family Helene L. Kaplan, Chair, Mount Sinai School of Medicine Stephen M.

        KAHN-Melvin, M.D. The Mount Sinai Alumni express profound sorrow at the loss of our esteemed colleague and dear friend. A member of Mount Sinai's staff for over forty years, Dr. Kahn represented the best tradition of the Medical Center. His fusion of scientific skill and compassionate concern for his patients, his warmth and keen sense of humor, earned him the respect of all who knew him. Our deepest condolences are extended to his family. Avi Barbasch, M.D., President Jeffrey S. Freed, M.D., Vice Pres. Maria Padilla, M.D., Secretary William G. Stein, Treasurer
