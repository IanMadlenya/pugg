        KINDMAN--Jerry. With deep sorrow and affection we mourn the passing of Jerry Kindman on November 12, 2004, at the age of 67. He was surrounded by family and friends. Beloved husband of Gloria, devoted father of Hillary, Jennifer and the late Stewart. He was both an intellectual and an adventurer, with an encyclopedic mind and a gentle soul. He was a connoisseur of life, and will be missed by all who knew him. A memorial service celebrating the life of Jerry will be held at Riverside Memorial Chapel, Amsterdam Ave. and West 76th St., on Sunday, November 14, at 1 pm.
