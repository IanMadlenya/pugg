        FUCHS-Joseph. On October 30, 2000. A born & bred New Yorker, residing in Greenwich Village for over 50 years. Proud to be an American, and proud to be Jewish. He joined the Navy at 18, and at 23, The Merchant Marines, serving with courage in the North Atlantic and Pacific in World War II. An elected official in The National Maritime Union, he negotiated for the rights of ordinary seamen. A man of principle, integrity and generosity.
