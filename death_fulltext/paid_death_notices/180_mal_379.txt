        SHEBA-Dov. With great sorrow we announce the passing of Dov Sheba on Jan. 18, 2002, in Israel. A founding member of Kibbutz Eilon, Dov worked tirelessly in recent years for the establishment and expansion of the Keshet Eilon Violin Mastercourse. In honor of his memory, his many friends would appreciate contributions to American Friends of Keshet Eilon Inc., P.O. Box 284, Mamaroneck, New York 10543. Dov Sheba will be forever in our hearts.
