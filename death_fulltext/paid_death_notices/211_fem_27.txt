        LEFF--Fredda S. Yeshiva University and its Wurzweiler School of Social Work deeply mourn the passing of the vice chair of the Board of Governors of the Wurzweiler School. A former social worker and Wurzweiler alumna, Fredda joined its Board in 1990 and became one of the school's most insightful, enthusiastic, and devoted members. She was a dynamic and multi-talented individual and a leader among women in both philanthropy and business.

We extend our most heartfelt condolences to her husband, Bruce; children, Matthew Evan and Fara Kate; and to all the members of Fredda's family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel, President Norman Lamm, Chancellor Ronald P.
