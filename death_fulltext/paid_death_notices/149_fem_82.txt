        REASER-Bernice Dalziel, a pianist and teacher for more than 60 years, died June 5, 1999 at Abbey Delray, Delray Beach, Florida. Born in Algona, Iowa, she was the daughter of Harry and Julia Tellier Dalziel. She graduated from the Fort Dodge, Iowa schools and attended Grinnell College. She was a pupil of E. Robert Schmitz and of Abby Whiteside. In 1925, while teaching in a Fort Dodge music school directed by Jennie Ringland Smeltzer, she was married to Robert Alden Reaser, artist-son of Willbur A. Reaser, New York portrait painter. After some years of European study, Mrs. Reaser was given her first hearing at the Minneapolis home of Mr. and Mrs. Sumner T. McKnight, early patrons of the Minnesota Orchestra, for whom their concert hall is named. She gave the first of many New York recitals in 1945 at Town Hall. Mrs. Reaser collaborated with her husband in an original entertainment called ''Recitals in Black and White'' in which they portrayed the action of several ballets by means of swift line drawings, music, and commentary. These programs were successful in schools and colleges during the Depression Years and were presented in New York at Carnegie Recital Hall and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Reasers also taught music, art, and sailing at ''Pomemah,'' a girls' summer camp in Kent, Connecticut. In Florida, Mrs. Reaser was active in the Palm Beach Music Teachers' Association, had taught for a time at Gulf Stream Private School, directed music at St. Paul's Episcopal Church, and had recently given many recitals at Abbey Delray, where she has lived since 1986.
