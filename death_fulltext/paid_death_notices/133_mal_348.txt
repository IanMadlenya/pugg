        DUNTON-H. Donald, M.D. The Executive Committee, faculty, staff and candidates of the Columbia University Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research, express our deepest sorrow over the death of our colleague, H. Donald Dunton. He was a distinguished training and supervising analyst at the Columbia Psychoanalytic Center and chair of child psychiatry at Columbia University. We will miss not only his warmth and vitality but his creativity and intellectual vigor. We extend our sympathy to his wife Patricia, his children, Craig, Timothy and Lese, and his eighteen grandchildren. Robert A. Glick, M.D., Director
