        ESSERMAN-Paul R., M.D. The Partners and Staff of Concorde Medical Group are saddened by the loss of our esteemed and beloved colleague. He was admired by his patients for his humanity and caring, and respected by his peers for his knowledge and skills. To us he will always be the paragon by which other physicians are judged. We will miss him greatly.
