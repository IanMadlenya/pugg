        PODGAINY--Marilyn Spiner, Esq., of Dix Hills, September 24, 2003. Beloved wife of Dr. Martin, loving mother of MSgt. Vivian L. and Mark D., adored grandmother of Elizabeth and Edward Goldsworthy, Lila and Georgia Podgainy, dear sister of Frances Dembling, dear motherin-law of Thomas Goldsworthy and Lisa Usdan. There was nothing that she couldn't do, once she made up her mind to do it. LSAT, law school and bar exams of 3 states--all after the children were grown. The only battle she lost was to lung cancer. G-d, you picked a winner. In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to Temple BethEl of Huntington, NY, Good Samaritan Hospital Medical Center (Dr. Marvin Bernstein Memorial), West Islip, NY, Good Shepherd Hospice, Babylon, NY, and the Pastoral Care Dept. at Our Lady of Consolation, West Islip, NY.
