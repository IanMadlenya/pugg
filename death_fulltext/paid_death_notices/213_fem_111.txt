        WEEKES--Daphne, a wellknown pianist and Caribbean personality, passed away quietly on October 8, 2004 at her residence on Park Place in Brooklyn. With her versatile Caribbean orchestra, she was instrumental in bringing together Trinidadians in NY, especially during the preLenten Carnival and Calypso celebrations since her arrival here from Trinidad in 1947.
