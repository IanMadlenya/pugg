        ROBERTS-Mitchell S., 9/7/13-7/17/ '97. A gentle man and a gentleman has succumbed after a long and brave battle. Pre-deceased by his loving wife, Irma. Varied career included instructor at CCNY and Director of AMREP Corp. Already missed by surviving children, Seth and Ronna and Ross; grandchildren Adam and Ethan mourn the loss of their beloved Poppy Mike. Often an inspiration, always supportive, his kind words and deeds smoothed our paths. He was loved and respected by all who had the pleasure of knowing him. In accordance with Mike's wishes, there will be no service. The family will observe a brief period of mourning at Seth and Ronna's home.
