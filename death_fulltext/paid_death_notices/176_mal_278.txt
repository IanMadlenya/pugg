        BERRY-Joseph John. Of Saddle River, N.J. Joe was a victim of the World Trade Center tragedy. Beloved husband of Evelyn. Cherished father of Joseph Scott, Todd Patrick and Kimberly Ann. Our family and community have lost a person of great integrity, generosity and unbridled love for his fellow man. His children have lost their mentor, best friend and guiding light in all things. His wife has lost her partner, her best friend, her love. Joe was a man that always had a smile on his face and his family was his first priority. We are grateful to have had such a man in our lives and his spirit and philosophies will live through us and guide us always. Joe grew up in Woodhaven, Queens, attended Molloy High School, received his BA in Economics and Math from Queens College and his MBA from St. John's University. He was Chairman and Co-CEO of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc., an investment banking firm headquartered in the World Trade Center. For the last two years, Joe was honored as one of the top fifty Irishmen on Wall Street by Irish America Magazine. A Memorial Mass will be celebrated at 12:30pm on Saturday, September 22 at St. Gabriel's Church, 88 East Saddle River Road, Saddle River, NJ. No flowers please.
