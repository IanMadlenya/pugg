        FRIBOURG--Eugenie M, January 28. Eugenie would have been 99 years old on February 13. We will remember her for her love of life; her deep commitment to community and medicine; her passion for sailing and swimming; her sense of moral outrage and ethics; her closeness to family and friends. Loyal to Brooklyn her entire life, Eugenie was born into the Merzbach Fribourg family in 1908. She was enormously proud of her French and German Jewish heritage. After graduating from Barnard College, she spent some time in the fashion advertising business, until she found her life's calling in the field of medicine. She attended the Medical College of Virginia, graduating in 1939. She was married to Phil Tykulsker from 1948 until his death in 1961. As a doctor in Brooklyn, she was affiliated with Brooklyn Hospital for almost 60 years. Her twin brother, Louis was a judge, and her older brother Albert was also a lawyer. She is survived by her sister-in-law Anna Rose Tykulsker and Ruth Fribourg; nieces Ann Fribourg, Deborah Schwartz and Joy Matsuura; her nephews, David and Robert Tykulsker; grandniece's, Nadia and Vera Tykulsker; cousins, Jack Werner and Eugene Levy; Laurie, Eric, Ben and Susie Raisher; Michael, Karla and Rebecca Luxner. She is also survived by her friend and care giver, Jacqueline Etienne. We are inspired by Eugenie's spirit and strength and we will miss her terribly. Contributions in her memory should be directed to the Brooklyn Community Foundation, c/o Independence Community Foundation, 182 Atlantic Ave., Brooklyn, NY 11201
