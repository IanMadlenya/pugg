        FRIEDMAN--Gerald J. The faculty, staff, and students of New York University School of Medicine express their deep regret and sadness on the death of our friend and colleague Gerald J. Friedman, M.D. He graduated from NYU School of Medicine in 1937 and was appointed to the Faculty in 1938, remaining in the Department of Medicine until his death. His contributions to medicine, particularly in the areas of nutrition and diabetes have been reflected in leading medical journals, with numerous citations throughout the world. Dr. Friedman and his family have been longtime benefactors of the School of Medicine, and their generosity has touched the lives of students, colleagues and many other members of our community. We extend our deepest condolences to the entire Friedman family. Kenneth G. Langone, Chairman NYU School of Medicine Foundation Board of Trustees Robert M. Glickman, M.D. Dean NYU School of Medicine
