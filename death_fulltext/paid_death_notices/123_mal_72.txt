        DOVER-Pliny Giles, of Millburn, NJ, on April 4, 1997. A retired transportation engineer, he was the New Jersey Turnpike's original Engineer of Design from its inception in 1949 through its opening and first five yars of operation and expansion. He was instrumental in developing the geometric design standards and features that brought the Turnpike national prominence among major highways for safety and efficiency. Many of these design concepts saw further use and success in the Interstate Highway program that followed. Mr. Dover later headed the highway design section at the consulting engineering firm of DeLeuw, Cather and its affiliates during which time he served two years in Perth, Australia. Surviving are his daughter, Pamela Finney of Bronxville, NY, his sister, Mary Jane Lott of Richmond, VA, his brother, John R. of New Vernon, NJ, six nephews and nieces and their children. Contributions in his memory may be made to The Thogmorton-Dover Scholarship Fund, Central Methodist College, Fayette, MO 65248 or The Corner Store Dance Company, 1428 Midland Ave., Bronxville, NY 10708.
