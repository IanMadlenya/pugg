        EDWARDS-Lillian. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society are deeply saddened by the loss of Lillian Edwards of Houston and Palm Beach, a devoted supporter. As Technion Guardians, she and her late husband Milton demonstrated the highest level of commitment to the American Technion Society, the Technion and Israel. They funded numerous scholarships, academic chairs and lectureships, and a dormitory, many of these anonymously. A gracious hostess, who annually welcomed Technion students and professors, Lillian was an active member of the Southern Region in Palm Beach, before relocating to Houston to live with her daughter, Susan, a member of the Houston Chapter Board of Directors. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Susan and the entire Edwards family. American Society for TechnionIsrael Institute of Technology Lawrence S. Jackier, President Irving A. Shepard, Chairman of the Board Melvyn H. Bloom, Executive Vice President Hershel M. Rich, Chairman, Southwestern Region Isaac Dvoretzky, President, Houston Chapter Coleman D. Caplovitz, Honorary Pres., Houston Chapter Paul R. Chanin, Chairman, Palm Beach Chapter Paul Wieseneck, President, Palm Beach Chapter
