        REEVES--Jean. She never stopped learning and loving. She gave more than she received. She is survived by her daughter Sharon Walker of Bluffton, South Carolina, two sons William of Dayton, Ohio, and Michael of New York City, a sister Carmen Jackson of Summerfield, Florida, three grandchildren and three great grandchildren. She will be greatly missed.
