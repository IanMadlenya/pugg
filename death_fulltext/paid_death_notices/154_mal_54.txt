He was instrumental in the development and success of Max Blau & Sons, Inc., a company that is now run by the third and fourth generations of his family. He brought a certain charisma and charm to everything he did.

His favorite section of the newspaper was the ''Bids Wanted'' in the legal advertising section. Raymond was always willing to take on any project or bid, and successfully brought in business from all over the world. He was a wealth of knowledge to all who knew him, and a mentor to many people. His kindness and gentle nature will not be forgotten. He was a dedicated and loving family man. There was nothing that he would not do for his family. Raymond was the loving husband of the late Hope Blau for over 59 years. He is survived by his loving daughters Maxine Blau and Adele Blau Cass and grandsons David and Gregory Cass. Raymond and Hope will forever be remembered in our hearts.
