        STRAUSS--Herbert A. The directors, officers and members of the American Federation of Jews from Central Europe deeply mourn the passing of Professor Herbert A. Strauss, longtime President of the Research Foundation for Jewish Immigration and a Board member of the Federation. A native of Wuerzburg, Germany, Professor Strauss survived WWII in hiding. After coming to New York, he rose to a Professorship at the College of the City of New York and became the Director of the Center Against Anti-Semitism at the Free University of Berlin. His life was dedicated to his work, his family and his many friends. A kind, modest and warm scholar, a brilliant mind and a prolific and meticulous lecturer and writer, he leaves an unfillable void. Our deepest sympathy goes out to his widow, daughter and grandchildren. Fritz Weinschenk, Pres. American Federation of Jews from Central Europe
