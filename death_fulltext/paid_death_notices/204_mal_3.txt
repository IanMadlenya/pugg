        DWORMAN -- Menachem. With deep sorrow we note the passing on December 28, 2003 at age 73 of our dear friend Menachem Emanuel (Manny) Dworman, owner of the Olive Tree, Comedy Cellar and proprietor of the Cafe Feenjon, the legendary Near Eastern Club-all in Greenwich Village. He too was a legend, bringing together hundreds of performers and thousands of fans of disparate background. His vision, music, talent and heart will be with us forever. Services at Riverside Chapel, Amsterdam at 76 Street at 11:45 AM Friday. His wife Ava, his son Noam and his many friends and colleagues
        DWORMAN -- Menachem. Your Cafe Feenjon brought together music and people. Arab and Jew, Turk and Greek, Russian and American, opening a wonderful world to many and inspiring my radio program ''Music From Around the World''. I shall remember you and those ''good times'' forever. Erev Sholem. Erwin Frankel and Family
