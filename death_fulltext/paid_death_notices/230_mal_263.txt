        BEUTEL--Bill. The Board and Administration of Southampton Hospital and the Southampton Hospital Foundation mourn the loss of Bill Beutel, whose warmth, talent and friendship embraced our cause. A loyal friend, he shall be dearly missed. We offer our deepest sympathy to his wife, Adair, a much-admired former member of our Board, and to his family.
