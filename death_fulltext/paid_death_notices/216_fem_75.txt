        HERBST--Eugenia Victoria (nee Levin). On January 7, 2005. Beloved wife of the late Frank F. Herbst. Loving mother of Edward and Peter and mother-in-law of Beth Skinner and Ann Colin Herbst. Dear sister of Mimi and Rhoda. Adoring grandmother of Nico, Gabrielle, William and Nicholas. As an administrator for H.I.P., Ombudsman for City Council President Paul O'Dwyer, head of the Quality Improvement Program for the NYC Department of Health, Supervisor in the Office of Municipal Labor Relations and member of the NYS Office of Medical Conduct Ethics Panel, Jean fought tirelessly to make the public health system truly serve the public. Jean was a warm, nurturing and loving mother, motherin-law, and grandmother, but what made her so exceptional was that she extended these qualities to so many other people all over the world. Jean had friends in Indonesia, Thailand, Nepal, England, Ireland and Japan, where she recently spent two weeks on an exhaustive visit. Her openness to new people, new experiences, and new cultures was unique. We, her family, will miss her beyond expressing, as will so many people in distant places. Service Monday, 11:15 am, at ''The Riverside,'' 76 St and Amsterdam Ave. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in her name to the Bread and Roses Cultural Project of 1199 SEIU, Esther Cohen, Executive Director, 330 W. 42 St., NY, NY 10036.
