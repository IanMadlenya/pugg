She survived adversity, fighting Nazis in the French Underground during WWII, rescuing American and British Air Force pilots. She was a breast cancer survivor, having fought and vanquished that disease in her late 40's. She was truly made of the ''right stuff.''

She worked a full fiveday week until seven months before she died, never wavering in her dedication to ''right vs. wrong.'' Loving wife to the late Richard Robin. Devoted and loving mother to Jacky and Jeff Clyman, doting and proud grandmother to Mark and Liz Clyman, and Scott Clyman, beloved sister to Bernard and Lulu Jessier. She will be sorely missed by her family, friends and colleagues. Services Monday, November 6, 2006, at Riverside Memorial, 76th and Amsterdam.
