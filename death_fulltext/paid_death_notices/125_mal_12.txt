        BRINDELL-Harold. Hazzan. The Cantors Assembly records with sorrow the passing of the Hazzan of West Surburban Temple Har Zion of River Forest, IL for more than four decades. He served the spiritual needs of his congregants with great dignity, warmth and care. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Florence, his children, grandchildren and all his loved ones. May his memory abide as a blessing. Abraham Lubin, Pres. Henry Rosenblum, Pres. Elect Abraham B. Shapiro, Exec Admin
