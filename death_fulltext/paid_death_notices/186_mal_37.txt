        JORDAN-Joseph. Of Manhattan on July 1. Born in NYC 96 years ago. Beloved father of Vance Jordan and Jill Jordan Spangler, both of Manhattan. He is also survived by twin grandsons, Ian and Noel Spangler. The first American Director of Boys' Towns of Italy and American Relief for Italy, later Public Relations Director for LAI (now Alitalia), Mr. Jordan raised funds for many similar charitable organizations in the 1940s and '50s. He also wrote scripts for several early television dramas, and in 1966 established a talent agency for children which still bears his name. Though he outlived most of his old friends, he found many new ones in recent years, and all deeply regret the loss of his humor and charm. No service is planned.
