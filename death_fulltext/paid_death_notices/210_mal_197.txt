        DRUCKER--Burton N. We mourn the loss of our dear friend, Burt, who died in Phoenix, AZ on June 12th, 2004. Burt was, above all, a dedicated Democrat who gave unstinting loyalty to the party both in NYC and Phoenix. For 25 years we had the pleasure of visiting Burt in Phoenix and exchanging political ''war stories.'' We loved him and will miss him greatly.
