        LEHNER-Daniel A. The Boards of St. Francis-Mercy Corporation express their deepest sympathy on the sudden passsing of our esteemed trustee, Daniel A. Lehner. As a prominent business and civic leader, he championed community health services and was an active supporter of Mercy Medical Center. He will be remembered for his generosity and concern for those in need, and will be sorely missed by the countless friends he has made among us. The prayers of the entire Mercy Medical Center and St. Francis Hospital family are with his wife, Remy and his children, on their tragic loss. Leslie C.
