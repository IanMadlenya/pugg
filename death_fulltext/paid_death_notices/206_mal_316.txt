        MARTINSON--Paul. The partners, counsel, associates and staff at Phillips Nizer LLP deeply mourn the passing of our distinguished former partner and mentor. Together with Louis Nizer, he counseled business leaders, entertainment luminaries and government officials during his forty years with the firm. He will long be recognized for his brilliant work in the landmark case of John Henry Faulk vs. AWARE which served to defeat blacklisting in the 1950's. Countless attorneys credit him with teaching them the art of advocacy, and many institutions of music and art benefited from his sage advice. He will be sorely missed. We extend our deepest condolences to his beloved wife, Frances, and his family. Perry S. Galler, Chairman Executive Committee Phillips Nizer LLP
