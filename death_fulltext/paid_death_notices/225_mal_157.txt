        KLOTZ -- Alexander Beau masche. On October 12, six weeks after his ninety-ninth birthday, passed away peacefully in his sleep. Beloved patriarch, he is mourned by his daughter Anne Klotz Siviglia, his son-in-law Peter Siviglia, two granddaughters Ellen Siviglia Cutshall and Judith Siviglia, and four great grandchildren, Jacob, Alexis and Rebecca Cutshall and Alexander Griffin Giviglia. Alexander Klotz practiced law for over forty years, first as a single practitioner and then in partnership with his brotherin-law in the firm Klotz and Gould, which continues in practice today. A member of the bar in three states, New York, New Jersey, and California, he retired from the law in 1973, moving to Rancho Bernardo, California where he taught adult education classes, one of which, on interpreting the media, continued to meet as a discussion group for over twenty-five years. He was one of the founders of Temple Adat Shalom, now thriving in its 31st year. A member of the Masonic Brotherhood for almost seventy years, at Emanuel Lodge he worked tirelessly to send inner city boys to summer camp. A man of great intelligence and generous heart, he strove always to make the world a better place. He touched the lives of countless people, many of whom remained unaware of his contribution to their betterment. His presence will remain as a loving benediction. Services Sunday, October 16, 10 A.M.
