        ROOSEVELT--Oliver Jr. The Board and Staff of Ballet Hispanico feel the deepest sympathy for our esteemed Executive Director Verdery Roosevelt on the loss of her father, Oliver W. Roosevelt Jr. In addition to serving for more than 30 years as fine arts editor and music critic for the Birmingham News, he taught Music Appreciation at local colleges and was a member of the boards for the Birmingham Chamber Music Society and the Red Mountain Chamber Orchestra. He also was choir director for several Episcopalian Churches. We extend condolences to all members of the family at this sad time.
