        CASTELNUOVO-Dr. Lamberto. The Queens-Long Island Medical Group and the Nassau-Queens Region mourn the death of one of its founders, Dr. Lamberto Castelnuovo. Dr. Castelnuovo has been a major force in the success of the group, particularly the Flushing Center, where he had worked for the past 37 years. His energy and determination, as well as his compassionate and caring demeanor have made him one of the most valuable physicians in the group. He will be sorely missed by his colleagues, staff and patients.
