        HINTON - James. The Trustees and Staff of the Hudson River Museum record with sorrow the passing of Jim Hinton, Trustee of the Museum. He was a researcher, teacher, filmmaker, photographer and, above all, an artist whose photographs bear eloquent testimony to the tragedies and triumphs of African-Americans and are a powerful witness to an important part of American history.
