        WALSH-James. The Kaplan family, Ruth, Joe and Ken, mourn the loss of an old and good friend, James Walsh. Although prominent as a philosophy professor at Columbia University, we knew him best as a long time neighbor in Suffern, NY. Mostly we rememeber this warm, one-of-akind as a ski, hiking and fly fishing buddy. Our fond nostaglic thoughts are with his ailing wife, Carol Jean and his sons, Johnny and Jimbo.
