        WALLENSTEIN -- Maxwell, on June 19, 2005. Loving husband of Rosalie and the late Pearl, father of Barry and David, grandfather of Daniel, Jessica, Marc, and Matthew. He was a strong, loving and dynamic person, a major presence in the wholesale meat industry--founder and owner of White House Beef Co. He will be missed very much by all who knew him.
