        ROSENTHAL--Paul. The entire Royce Hosiery family mourns the passing of Paul Rosenthal, Vice President Information Technology. Paul was a most valuable member of the Royce team for over a decade. Paul, through his diligent and organized approach, developed business systems that have enabled our company to prosper. We will miss his acumen, warmth and friendship. We offer our deepest condolences to his wife Barbara, their children Hailey and Jordan, his entire family and many friends.
