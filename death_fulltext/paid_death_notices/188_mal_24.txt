        HAMPTON-Lionel. The Officers, Governors and Members of The New York Friars Club deeply mourn the loss of their beloved and esteemed member Lionel Hampton. A member of the Club for the last 52 years, he helped us preserve the rich theatrical roots of the Friars Club. He was a musical genius with enormous talent, who shared a legacy of commitment to the very best. We are honored and proud to have been touched by the legend that will always be Lionel Hampton. Services will be held at Riverside Church, 490 Riverside Drive (at 120th St), on Saturday, September 7, 10 AM. Alan King, Abbot Freddie Roman, Dean Sally Jessy Raphael, Prior Stewie Stone, Scribe Fred C. Klein, Treasurer Jean-Pierre Trebot, Executive Director
