        DECOSSE-Jerome J., M.D., PhD. The Boards, Faculty, and Staff of Weill Medical College of Cornell University and New York-Presbyterian Hospital mourn the passing of our distinguished colleague Dr. Jerome J. DeCosse. Dr. DeCosse was the first holder of the Medical College's Lewis Thomas University Professorship and had been Professor & Vice Chairman of the Department of Surgery since 1978. The author of more than 250 articles and books, he was a leader in establishing guidelines for the detection, treatment, & prevention of colorectal cancer. He expanded our understanding of patients with hereditary colon cancer by recognizing their special needs. An outstanding educator of medical students, surgical residents, and surgeons, he served on innumerable professional and national committees, and, despite illness, he worked tirelessly until his death for the Department of Surgery, the Hospital, and the College. His intelligence, his keen wit, and his personal warmth will be sorely missed. We extend our deepest condolences to his family. Contributions to an endowed professorship in Dr. DeCosse's name may be sent to the Development Department, Weill Cornell Medical College, 525 E. 68th St., Box 123, New York 10021. Antonio M. Gotto, Jr., M.D. Dean, Weill Cornell Medical College Herbert Pardes, M.D. President and CEO, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital John M. Daly, M.D. Chairman, Department of Surgery
