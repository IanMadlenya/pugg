        BAREST--Herman, MD. The Department of Ophthalmology of the Montefiore Medical Center mourns with great sadness the passing of Dr. Herman Barest, esteemed colleague and neuro-ophthalmologist. He will be especially remembered for his commitment and devotion to teaching residents during a career that spanned more than fifty years. He will be sorely missed.
