        TEIDOR--Esther, age 91, died April 19th with the courage and beauty that always defined her. Mourned by loving sister Lillian Hack, adoring nieces and nephews Joel Park, Patti Kenner, Madeline Dreifus, Dennis Askwith, Jessica Hack, Stephanie Swoveland, Kathy Franklin, devoted brother-in-law Bert Askwith, caring nephew-in-law Charles Dreifus. She was a blessing and inspiration to her family and friends. Her heroes were Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr, Dr. Benjamin Spock, Golda Meir, Mahatma Gandhi. She marched in Selma. She spoke against injustice. She loved us unconditionally. She now joins in eternity her older sister Rose Teidor Park, her twin sister Sylvia Teidor, her younger sister Miriam (Mimi) Askwith. We feel emptiness with the loss of her physical presence in our lives, yet we give thanks for how her spirit will forever fill our souls. She has bequeathed us a precious legacy. Private services were held.
