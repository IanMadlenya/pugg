        WATERS-DASHEVSKY-Hallie Sarah departed from this world on October 15, 2006 at the age of 22. Her gifts and accomplishments are too numerous to recount here. She was a poet, a writer, a collage artist, a performer, and a dedicated friend. Although words were her primary creative medium, words could not fully convey her wisdom, compassion, and wit, and in the end could not hold her spirit. Hallie was a senior at Bard College, in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, and had also attended Union County College in Cranford, New Jersey. Hallie was a certified yoga instructor, a member of the First Presbyterian Church of Cranford, and spent some of her most joyful moments on stage at the Cranford Dramatic Club. She is survived by her mother Virginia Waters of Cranford, (her father, Sidney George Dashevsky passed away in 2003), her brother Adam, of Cranford, her sister Anne Dashevsky of Neptune, NJ, her sister Karen Dashevsky of Charlestown, MA, and all who continue to love her. A memorial celebration of her life will be held at the First Presbyterian Church of Cranford at 11 AM on Saturday October 21, with a reception to follow at the Church. Hallie wished that donations be made to the John Drulle Memorial Lyme Fund, 702 Brewers Bridge Road, Jackson, New Jersey 08527. For information The Gray Memorial Funeral Home, Cranford, NJ
