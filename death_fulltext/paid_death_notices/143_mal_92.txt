        JEFFREYS-Jeffrey M. This is a big one, friends. Jeff has died at 59, on December 3, 1998, at his home in Greenwich Village. He had cancer, but the end was fairly quick as these things go. (Jeff did tend to disapprove of pain and suffering except at the opera.) Born in Iowa, he came to NYC in 1957 and only left it to serve as a Navy Medical Corpsman or for his many trips abroad. He worked mostly as a theatre treasurer and had been at Radio City Music Hall since 1992, but sometimes he performed, notably in 1973 in Jean Dubuffet's ''Coucou Bazar'' in NY and Paris, and with ''Liquid Theatre'' at the Guggenheim. A charismatic and charming guy, he had a passion for two islands, Manhattan and Vieques. He will be much missed in both. Officially survived by his sister, Joan J. Mayer of Falkville, AL. Jeff has a large family of friends, and though final arrangements are private, there will be a memorial TBA. Donations to Broadway Cares/EFA.
