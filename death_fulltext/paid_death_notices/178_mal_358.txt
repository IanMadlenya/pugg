        BARRETT-William L. While Bill always reminded his listeners that he was a product of Jesuit schooling, he grew into being the Rabbi to many giants in the real estate industry who considered Bill a true friend, advisor and mentor, not just for the immediate but of lifelong duration. He was charitable to many causes, attending few functions in person, but always by contributions and sharing. He never said no. May his memory be a consolation to his family, friends, clients, and all who had the privilege of knowing this gentle gentleman. Agins, Siegel & Reiner, LLP Solomon J. Freedman
