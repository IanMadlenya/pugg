        CORELLI--Franco. The Metropolitan Opera deeply mourns the passing of one of the twentieth century's greatest tenors, Franco Corelli. From the time of his Met debut in 1961, he became a favorite of New York audiences. Although he began his career in Italy, the Met became his home theater, and we were privileged to have him perform 368 times over 24 years with our company. His large, vibrant voice and his tall, strikingly handsome stage presence perfectly fit the great romantic tenor roles of Verdi and Puccini. The thrill of hearing his fullthroated tones flooding the theater became operatic legend, and rightfully so. Few singers of any era have had so loyal and devoted a following. We join in the bereavement of his admirers everywhere and extend our sincerest condolences to his wife, Loretta. Joseph Volpe General Manager James Levine Artistic Director
