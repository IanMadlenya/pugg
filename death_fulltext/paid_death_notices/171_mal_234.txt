        LIGNON-Alfred. The Board of Directors, other volunteers and staff of the United Hospital Fund are deeply saddened by the loss of a dear friend. For more than a decade, Fred served as a devoted, thoughtful and enthusiastic Fund volunteer and active hospital auxilian. His keen interest in health care issues, engaging personality, and commitment to better health care for all New Yorkers were an inspiration to the many people he touched. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Tina, and daughter Monique and other members of his family. Howard Smith, Chairman James R. Tallon, Jr., President Suzanne Pred Bass, Chairman, Committee on Voluntary Initiatives
