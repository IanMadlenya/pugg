        NAF-Dr. Ulrich. A noted biologist and botanist died on May 1, 1998 at Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York at the age of 76 after an extended illness. A resident of Riverdale, New York for over 30 years, he was born and raised in Switzerland where he served in the Swiss Army at the border with Germany during the Second World War. Dr. Naf developed his interest in nature as a boy observing and studying the play behavior of mountain goats in the Alps. He moved to the United States in the late 40's and obtained a Ph.D. in Biology from Yale University in 1953. For several years he did research at Rockefeller Institute on a variety of topics, including tumors that occurred spontaneously on hybrid tobacco plants, before joining the faculty of Manhattan College in 1962. At Manhattan College, he concentrated his research on the reproductive processes of fern plants. He retired from Manhattan College in 1981 as a Professor of Biology. Also an expert on birds and their behavior, butterflies, mammals and other natural elements, he continued this work after retirement, taking particular interest in the fauna and flora of neighboring Van Cortlandt Park, where he tracked the appearance and disappearance of various species of plants and animals. He wrote for several scholarly journals, including ''The American Journal of Botany,'' ''Science,'' and ''Nature'' and was a member of numerous environmental organizations, including the American Botanical Society and American Society of Plant Physiologists. He is survived by his sister and brother-in-law Heidi and Albert Laeuchli Naef and two brothers and sister-inlaws, Walter and Esther Naef and Robert and Christine Naef, all residing in Switzerland. Funeral arrangements were private.
