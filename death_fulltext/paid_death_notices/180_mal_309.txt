        PREVOR-Irwin. Age 70, of Atlanta, GA, formerly of NYC, died unexpectedly December 14, 2001. He was born in Brooklyn, NY, in 1931. Before leaving to join the staff at the American Cancer Society, he worked for Forbes Magazine. Irwin came to Georgia in 1988 to continue his career as Vice President for Benefits and Insurance Planning when the American Cancer Society relocated there. Throughout his career, Irwin never stopped devising new and better employee benefit plans, including cancer screening tests, long term disability, tax deferred annuity and HMO medical plans to the society's total benefits package. By providing post retirement medical, dental and life insurance coverage, he ensured a good retirement package for every retiree. He earned a reputation among his non-profit peers as a leader in the employee benefits field. Irwin is survived by his wife, Marilyn. A memorial service is pending.
