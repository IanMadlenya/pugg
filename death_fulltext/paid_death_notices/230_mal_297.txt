        GERMAIN--Lawrence In loving memory of my dear husband, Lawrence, who passed away March 24, 1991. God Bless you Lawrence in your grave, God keep you in his care. And may He listen to my heart And hear my fervent prayer. May you have peace and rest at last From every care and woe, And may you sleep in comfort From the winds and rain and snow. God Bless you for your caring ways And all you tried to do, To bring me happiness on earth And make my dreams come true. Til the roses lose their petals And the heather sheds its dew Til the end of time, Dear Lawrence, I will love and pray for you
