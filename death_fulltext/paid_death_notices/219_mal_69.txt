        WELLIVER--Neil. It is with deep sadness that we mark the death on Tuesday of our dear friend Neil Welliver. The magnificent light filled paintings of his beloved Lincolnville woods will live on along with his great and generous spirit. Our condolences to his wife Mimi and surviving children Titus, Ethan and John. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be sent in Neil's memory to Waldo County General Hospital, PO Box 287, Belfast, ME 04915. A memorial service is planned for 11 AM on July 22 at St. Margaret's Episcopal Church in Belfast. Phil Alexandre Alexandre Gallery, New York alexandregallery.com
