        GREEN-Arthur. Colleagues, students, fellows and families at Babies & Children's Hospital and the Department of Pediatrics of the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University mourn the loss of Dr. Arthur Green who recently died after eighteen years of devoted service to this hospital. A pioneer in his chosen field, child abuse, Dr. Green was one of the first (and still few) psychiatrists capable of assessing troubled parents, children and their relationships in a psychoanalytically and therapeutically oriented way. A co-founder and medical director of both the Family Center and Therapeutic Nursery at Babies & Childrens Hospital, Dr. Green also (wrote the book) on sexual abuse & was a major respected and innovative clinician, investigator, mentor and teacher nationally, and internationally. He will be missed by his many admirers in Italy, in Croatia, in Holland and in the countries where he conversed fluently, gave unstintingly of himself, worked and played energetically and was ever eager to help a maltreated child regardless of bureaucratic barriers, right up to the final days of his oh-so-full life.
