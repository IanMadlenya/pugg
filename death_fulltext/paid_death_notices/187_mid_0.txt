        GORDON-Barbara. The Montefiore-Einstein Heart Center is sad to announce the untimely death of Mrs. Barbara Gordon, the wife of our friend Dr. Garet Gordon, longtime Montefiore physician and administrator. Barbara was a gifted artist, teacher, writer and awardwinning editor as well as a dedicated wife and mother. She was a wonderful friend to those of us who were fortunate to know her. The entire Montefiore Cardiology community express its condolences to Dr. Gordon and his family.
