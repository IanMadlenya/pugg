        FUCHSMAN--Eric, 51. Of Barrington, IL., formerly of New York City, died on November 13, 2005 after a valiant battle against brain cancer. He was a creative force in the world of music, promoting concerts and encouraging performers. He is survived by his wife Laura of Barrington, his mother Vera of Ossining, N.Y., his daughter Alexandra of San Diego, his brother Paul of Newburgh, N.Y. and his inlaw parents Jack and Annette Westheimer of Long Grove, IL. We mourn deeply that a life so excitingly creative and so loving should be cut off so young.
