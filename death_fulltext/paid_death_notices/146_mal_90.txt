        LACK-Herbert. An elegant gentleman in the classical sense, a loving devoted husband, a truly solicitious father, a loyal, warm and affectionate friend. Our heartfelt condolences to Margery, Joanne and Penny. We share your great loss and envy the wonderful years you enjoyed with him. Larry Strauss & Esther Schwinger
