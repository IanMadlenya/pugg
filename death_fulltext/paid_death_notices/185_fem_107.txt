        FELDER-Betty. The Board of Directors of the Girls' Vacation Fund deeply regrets the passing of one of their founding Board Members, Mrs. Thomas B. Felder. Mrs. Felder was an active Board member for over 50 years serving side by side with her daughter, Bettina Felder in her last years on our Board. We extend our deepest sympathy to Bettina Felder and to her family and friends. Mario Diaz-Cruz III, Esq. President
