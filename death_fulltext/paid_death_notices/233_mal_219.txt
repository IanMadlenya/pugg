        MURRAY -- James J. Of Bronxville, New York and Londonderry, Vermont. Passed away peacefully on June 18, 2006 at age 67, following a long and heroic battle with cancer. Loving husband, father, and son. Graduate of Bishop Loughlin High School Class of 1957, Manhattan College Class of 1961, and Fordham Law School Class of 1964. An accomplished attorney who practiced in New York for over 40 years, his varied career included positions at Legal Aid, a Wall Street firm, and, ultimately, a smaller practice where he applied his skills to what fulfilled him most; advocating for the laborer and the vulnerable individual. Jim was a man of formidable intellect and legal acumen, but his chief legacy to his family and to those who knew him is a model of inexhaustible selflessness, unshakable devotion to family and friends, humility, and Christian manhood. Words are an inadequate medium for expressing the magnitude of his loss to his family and to the scores he touched throughout his life. Though he left us too soon, we are immeasurably richer for having been a part of his life. He lives on in all of us. Jim is survived by his wife of 34 years, Mary Jane Riordan Murray, his children John, Elizabeth, and James, his mother, Belinda Murray, his brother Peter and his wife, and many beloved friends and relatives. Wake Wednesday, June 21 at McGrath Funeral Home, Bronxville, New York from 2-4 and 7-9 P.M. Funeral Mass Thursday, June 22 at the Church of St. Joseph, Bronxville, New York, at 11 A.M.
