        SLATER-Michael. The staff and board of Friends of the Earth wish to express our deepest sadness on the untimely passing of Michael Slater, former president of Friends of the Earth Foundation. A pioneering activist, he was a true friend of the earth-humanitarian and environmentalist both. Throughout his life, Michael worked tirelessly to remind us all of the immense responsibility we have to leave a better world for the generations that follow us. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Teri, and his sons, Eric and Edward. At the family's request, donations may be made in his honor to Friends of the Earth, 1025 Vermont Avenue, NW, Suite. 300, Washington, DC, 20005.
