        GEE-Timothy S., M.D.. He was our good and compassionate friend and doctor-for our daughter, Lauri; for our dear friend, Herman Kannatt, and as chairman of the Medical Board of our Foundation. Tim, you will be missed. To Carol and family, we mourn our mutual loss and express our deep sympathy. Evelyn and Herb Strauss and all of the Lauri Strauss Leukemia Foundation Members
