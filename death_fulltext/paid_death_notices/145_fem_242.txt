        LONG-Ruth Stoddard, M.D. The Medical Staff of Saint Vincents Hospital mourns the passing of a beloved and distinguished member of our staff. Dr. Long, pioneer female ophthalmic surgeon, joined the staff in 1970 and developed and lead the retinal service. She trained three generations of ophthalmologists in retinal diseases who now practice throughout the United States and the world. Dr. Long will be remembered for her distinctive and unique style as well as her combination of glamour and intellect. Our condolences and prayers for Robert D'Amico, M.D. and her son, Justin.
