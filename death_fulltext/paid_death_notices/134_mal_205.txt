        ONGLEY-Patrick A. The Trustees, Officers and staff of the China Medical Board of New York, Inc., mourn the passing of a former President, Dr. Patrick Ongley. We extend our sincere condolences to his beloved wife, daughter, son and grandchildren. Dr. Ongley served as President and Trustee from January 1, 1970 until June 30, 1989. He led the China Medical Board's return in 1980 to the support of medical educational institutions in China. Furthermore, his unique understanding of the complex social, economic and political problems in Asia contributed much to the rapid progress of the China Medical Board's programs in various countries. The Board will miss him.
