        FESHBACH-Herman. It is with deep sorrow that the American Academy of Arts and Sciences mourns the death of Herman Fesbach, Institute Professor Emeritus at MIT and President of the Academy from 1982-1986. A renowned theoretical physicist and a leader in the development of nuclear reaction theory, he worked tirelessly on behalf of arms control and freedom for scientists throughout the world. During his tenure as President of the Academy, he expanded its studies of international security issues. The Academy extends its condolences to his wife, Sylvia, to his family, and to all those who learned and benefited from his passion for scientific truth and human rights. President James O. Freedman; Past Presidents: Leo L. Beranek, Harvey Brooks, Jaroslav Pelikan, and Victor Weisskopf; Executive Officer Leslie C. Berlowitz
