        KERR-M. Dorothea, MD. 8/13/183/20/98. Friends, colleagues and patients of Dr. Kerr were deeply saddened to learn of her passing on 3/20/98. Dr. Kerr began her medical career as a nurse almost sixty years ago, continued her education to earn her M.D. from Columbia University, and became the first woman to hold an internship in Internal Medicine at St. Luke's. Following a residency in Pathology, Dr. Kerr became an assistant medical examiner for the New York City Health Department. Her desire to bring empathy, understanding and effective care to patients led her to undertake a residency in Psychiatry at the Payne Whitney Clinic becoming one of the first women psychiatrists on staff. Dr. Kerr was Clinical Associate Professor of Psychiatry emeritus at Payne Whitney and Associate Attending Psychiatrist at the New York Hospital. In recent years, in addition to her private practice, Dr. Kerr worked with the Board of Education, evaluating adolescent behavior. Well loved and highly respected, she will be sorely missed and long remembered for her wisdom, wit, warmth and compassion.
        KERR-M. Dorothea, MD. Happy 80th birthday. Sadly missing you, but I know you are celebrating with Ernie and Faye-together again-and beloved Woody is at your side. I will always remember you with much love and gratitude. XO, Sue
