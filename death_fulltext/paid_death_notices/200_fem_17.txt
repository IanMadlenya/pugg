        DARTIGUE--Esther, retired educator and widow of Haiti's former Minister of Education and UNESCO's former Chief of Mission to the Congo, has died in Paris at 94. Born in Hungary, she earned degrees from Wooster College (Ohio) and Columbia's Teachers College, before moving to Haiti in 1931, where she directed a private nursery and elementary school, introduced sports for girls and worked with a number of charities. During 1948-56, she taught at New York's Mills College of Education and directed several nursery schools in Great Neck. From 1956-66 she directed the UN Nursery School in Paris and later taught English for a year in Burundi. She was the author of several articles on education and was a member of NEA in the US and of OMEP and UCA (which she helped found) in France. At 84, she wrote a biography of her husband, first published in France, which she then translated into English and brought out in the US as ''An Outstanding Haitian: Maurice Dartigue.'' She is survived by a son, John, of Los Angeles; sister Susan Rose and brothers John and Arthur Reithoffer, of Ohio; and nieces, nephews and beyond in Ohio, Illinois, Florida, Haiti and Jamaica.
