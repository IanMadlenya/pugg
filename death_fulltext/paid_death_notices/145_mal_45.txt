        MARX-Harold. We deeply regret the passing of our former president, Mr. Harold Marx. His enthusiasm and vision helped propel the growth of the Holliswood Jewish Center and the Holliswood community. As one of the true leaders of the past generation, he will be sorely missed. Young Israel of Holliwood Holliswood Jewish Center Rabbi: Marc Penner Presidium: Norman Horowitz, Esq. Neil Stein, MD
