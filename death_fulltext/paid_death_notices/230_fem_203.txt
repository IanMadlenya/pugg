        ANGELICH--Gina L. (Donatelli). Of White Plains, NY, at age 32, received the Lord's embrace on December 27, 2005, after a courageous battle with lymphoma. Gina was the cherished wife and partner of George and the loving and attentive mother of Gretchen. She was fiercely devoted to family, and her sense of humor will be sorely missed. Gina's gentle nature concealed a powerful woman. Through her service as a Eucharistic minister, volunteer projects, and commitment to persons with disabilities, she was an example of how to live a virtuous and graceful life. Gina was dedicated to her students at Vassar College, where she empowered young minds to achieve their full potential. Previously, she educated students at Our Lady of Sacred Heart in Pgh, PA, where she succeeded in turning young people into scholars. Gina was a graduate of Duquesne University where she earned undergraduate and two graduate degrees. She is survived by a large family who deeply mourn the profound loss. The family thanks the Lymphoma Service at MSKCC, especially Dr. Hamlin, and Dr. O'Connor. Gretchen and I need you here, but God needed you more. We miss and love you honey. Until we meet again.
