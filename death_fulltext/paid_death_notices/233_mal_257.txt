        GROSSMAN--William I., M.D.The Philoctetes Center for the Multidisciplinary Study of Imagination mourns the death of its Board Member, Dr. William I. Grossman. Psychoanalyst, scholar, and teacher, Bill's graceful brilliance and gentle presence lit the world for those who knew him. Freud wrote, ''The voice of the intellect is a soft one, but it does not rest til it has gained a hearing.'' Such was Bill's voice, and in the work he has left with us, it will ring out for a long time to come. We grieve with his wife Chanie, sons Eric and David, and all those who loved him. Edward Nersessian, M.D. Francis Levy, Co-Directors The Philoctetes Center
