        KAY-Nan Bennett. Vassar College mourns the loss of our trustee Nan Bennett Kay, Class of 1960. Nan Kay also served recently as president of her class and as a member of the Development Leadership Council. A warm, witty and generous woman, Nan had a fierce commitment to education, to young people, and to the arts. We extend our condolences to her husband, Stephen, and family.
