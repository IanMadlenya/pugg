        DUBE-Jackson E. Like Scaramouche, he was born with the gift of laughter and a sense that the world was mad. A native New Yorker, Jack died at the age of 79 on May 29 at his home in Chapel Hill NC with his wife Patricia and his family at his side. His dynamic career as a film importer and distributor gained him friends throughout the entertainment world. Always ready with a quip and a witty comeback, Jack stole the show. A UNC alum, he was a long-time member of the Friar's Club and a WWII Veteran. He joined the U.S. Airforce and served in Squadron 15, flying B-24's. Jack will be remembered as a ''bonhomme'' and a good guy whose sharp intelligence and irrepressible spirit inspired all who knew and loved him.
