        FORELAND-Sister Aasta. Her friends and colleagues at Lutheran Medical Center mourn the loss of Sister Aasta Foreland. Born on a small farm in Norway, Sister Aasta entered the Lutheran Deaconess program in 1929, becoming a nurse in 1936, and a consecrated Deaconess in 1937. In 1960, she was inducted into the office of Directing Sister, making her the seventh in succession to Sister Elisabeth Fedde, who founded Lutheran Medical Center in 1883. Following her retirement, Sister Aasta continued to volunteer countless hours to the hospital, and quietly went about doing unsung acts of kindness for many people in the community. In 1977, the hospital's new chapel was dedicated in her honor. For her exemplary life, Sister Aasta was awarded Norway's Saint Olav's Medal in 1981. All of us who knew her will be forever grateful for her warmth, friendliness and caring disposition. We offer our heartfelt condolences to her family and many friends.
