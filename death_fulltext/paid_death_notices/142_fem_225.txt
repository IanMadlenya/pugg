        CAMPBELL-Marion Danielson, of New York and Groton, Mass., former president and major stockholder of the Atlantic Monthly Company, died on November 24 in New York City at the age of 77. Mrs. Campbell's family acquired The Atlantic Monthly in 1938. Her own association with the venerable magazine began in 1943 as an editorial assistant. She was elected a director in 1953 and in 1957 became the major stockholder of the company and succeeded her father as president. She continued as president and director until the company was sold in 1980. She was also a director of the Providence (R.I.) Journal Company. A graduate of Foxcroft School and Vassar College (B.A. 1943) she worked in the editorial department of the Washington Post in 1944 and as a staff aid caseworker for the American Red Cross from 1944 to 1946. She was a major benefactor of many charitable institutions in New York, Boston and Groton and served on the boards of the Boston Museum of Science, The Deaconess-Nashoba Hospital, the Groton School and Lawrence Academy among other institutions. She maintained her family's ties to the Groton community, owning and successfully operating Gibbet Hill Farm, raising prizewinning black angus cattle, and Gibbet Hill Orchard. She was married to Douglass Campbell in 1962, formerly Vice President of the New York Central Railroad, and previously to the late Rev. Malcolm Strachan, who was Chaplain of Groton School. In addition to her husband she is survived by her sons, Richard Strachan of Portland, OR., & Stephen M. Strachan of Denver, CO, her daughter-inlaw, Deborah K. Strachan, and one grandchild, Kammer Douglass Strachan. A memorial service will be held at the St. John's Chapel of Groton School at a later date.
