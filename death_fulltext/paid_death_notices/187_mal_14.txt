        DAVIS-Louis. Irrepressible, and irreplaceable, our dear friend & tireless benefactor. It is with deep sadness that all of us at the Alzheimer's Association bid farewell to Lou, who for all these years was our own ''Hometown Hero''. He will be sorely missed. Our hearts go out to Barbara and Arnold, Robert and Linda, and the entire Davis family. The Board, Staff, Volunteers and Friends Alzheimer's Ass'n., NYC
        DAVIS-Louis. Daddy, you were the best in the world. Always there for me, loving, giving and supportive. I'll always be your Tootsie and Baby. I love you forever, Barbara
        DAVIS-Louis. Dad, the greatest compliment I ever received was being told ''you're just like your father''. I love you and I'll miss you, but now you'll be back with Mom. Love, Robert
