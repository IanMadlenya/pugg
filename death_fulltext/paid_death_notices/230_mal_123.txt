        WHITE--William J., 81, a resident of Vero Beach, FL and East Hampton, NY, (formerly of Woodbury, NY), lost his courageous battle against cancer on March 6, 2006. Survived by his wife Betty and her daughter, Caryn (Sylvain), loving children by his late wife, Shirley: Ann (Tom), David (Harriet), Marie (Gene), Amy (Wayne), Mark, his cherished grandchildren Tom, Nicole, Noelle, Stefan, and Derrick and his beloved sister Eileen Roeder. Pre-deceased by his parents John P. and Marie Gertrude White and his brothers, John, Richard, and Charles. Bill's illustrious career in advertising spanned many years with The New York Times Magazine Group. A man of consummate wit, taste, intelligence and integrity, Bill was a lover of the the arts and a ready fourth at the bridge table or on the golf course. In lieu of flowers, the family would appreciate donations to VNA/Hospice of Vero Beach, Florida. A memorial celebration of Bill's life is planned for a later date.
