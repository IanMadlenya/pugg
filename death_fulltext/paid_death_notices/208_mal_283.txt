        JOHNSON--Samuel C. Cornell University mourns the loss of a devoted alumnus and trustee emeritus, Samuel C. Johnson, a visionary leader whose entrepreneurial spirit, deep commitment to his family, and loyalty to the University were extraordinary. A member of the Class of 1950 and a much - honored executive whose dedication to education and to the environment were legendary, he joined S.C. Johnson Inc. in 1954 and later became president and CEO. He championed policies of corporate philanthropy, community service, social responsibility, and a familyfriendly work life. He became a Cornell trustee in 1966 and served on numerous committees, and from 1990-1995 he co-chaired the campaign council during the University's capital campaign. He was a member of the Cornell University Council and served as a Presidential Councillor. In 1984, he and his family made the largest gift ever to a graduate school of business. As a result of his extraordinary generosity, the University named the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management in honor of his great grandfather who founded the family business in 1886. He chaired the advisory council at the Johnson School and, among many other thoughtful and wise investments, endowed a professorship in sustainable global enterprise in 2003. He was a benefactor of Cornell's Laboratory of Ornithology and made innumerable gifts to support scholarships, campus life, and many other areas. Throughout the Cornell campus the Johnson name is synonymous with business education, the arts, and stewardship of natural resources. We express our sincere condolences to his wife, Gene Powers Johnson, and to his daughters, Helen JohnsonLeipold and Winnie Johnson Marquart, and his sons, Curt Johnson and Fisk Johnson. Peter Meinig, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, Cornell University Jeffrey S. Lehman, President, Cornell University
