        BARTEL-Harry, 35, died at his home in Manhattan, on Sunday, September 5. He is survived by his spouse, Brian Landeche; his mother, Eileen Bartel, of Scottsdale, Arizona; his father, Harry Bartel, of Sarasota, Florida; his sister, Donna Bartel, of Seattle; and his brother, Michael Bartel, of Phoenix. Mr. Bartel, together with Mr. Landeche, opened Splash bar in 1991 on 17th Street in Manhattan. It was an immediate hit and was credited with helping to spark the transformation of Chelsea into one of the nation's most celebrated gay neighborhoods. As one of New York's entertainment guides put it: ''Splash was in Chelsea before Chelsea was cool.'' Mr. Bartel was a familiar face at the bar, greeting regular patrons as well as visitors from around the world. He was active in charity work, supporting the Gay Men's Health Crisis, God's Work We Deliver, Amfar, the Anti-Violence Project, the Gay and Lesbian Switchboard, and the Gay Games of 1994 and 1998. He was a Log Cabin Republican, and worked closely with the community boards in lower Manhattan. He had many interests and was an avid tennis fan, gardener and cook. Mr. Bartel was born in 1964 in Astoria, Queens. He was raised in Scottsdale, Arizona, and was a graduate of Arizona State University with a degree in finance. Services are to be held on Friday at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue (at 112th Street). Viewing will take place from 10:30 to 11:45 AM and the memorial service will begin at 1 PM. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the Stonewall Foundation for the maintenance of the Harry Bartel Scholarship.
