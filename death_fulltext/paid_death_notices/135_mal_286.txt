        BEYER-Clarence. The Officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation note with deep sadness the death of our dedicated supporter Clarence Beyer, founder of Beyer Farms. He was devoted to our organization, serving as UJA Federation chair at Maspeth Jewish Center and chair of the Milk and Allied Industries Division. His son Henry, former chair of the Milk and Allied Industries Division, carries on the family tradition of philanthropy. We extend our sincere condolences to his wife, Bernice; his children, Maureen and Henry, and Heidi and Michael; his grandchildren, and all the members of the family. May they be consoled among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair Louise B. Greilsheimer, President Stephen D. Solender, Exec. V.P. Steven Schwartz, Chair, Milk and Allied Industries Div.
