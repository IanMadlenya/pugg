        FLEISHMAN--Naomi. The officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Naomi Fleishman, beloved mother of Stanley Fleishman, and mother-inlaw of Martine Fleishman. A cherished friend of UJA-Federation, Martine served on the Executive Committee for many years and was a past Chair of the Women's Campaign in Westchester. She was recently named the 2004 Women's Vice Chair for Flame Level Giving. We extend our deepest sympathies to the entire family. Larry Zicklin, President Morris W. Offit, Chair of the Board John S. Ruskay, Exec. V.P. & C.E.O. >>AD#
