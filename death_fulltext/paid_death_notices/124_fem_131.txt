        FLEISIG-Robin. Suddenly and untimely, on May 16. Beloved and loving wife and best friend of Roger Greene, loving mother of Eric and Perry Fleisig-Greene, dear daughter of Beverly and Earl Fleisig and cherished daughter-in-law of Ruth Greene and the late Murray Greene, beloved sister of Merrill and dear sister-in-law of Lloyd, Sharon, and John, and loving aunt of Emily. We will miss her tremendously.
        FLEISIG-Robin. Loving wife of Roger, mother of two extraordinary children, Eric and Perry, and wonderful friend; a woman whose life intersected with ours in so many ways that will now never be the same. How shall we manage a pas de quattre without you? Judy, Nick, Alexandra, Natasha Bunzl
