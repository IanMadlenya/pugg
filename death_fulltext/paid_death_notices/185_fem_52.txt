        BUCKNALL-Ann H. Graced the Board of Directors of The Horticultural Society of New York (HSNY) for nearly two decades, serving as its chairman from 1993 to 1996. The Board and Staff will miss her wise counsel, her energetic commitment to bringing the beauty of nature to the City, and particularly her work with children in our GreenBranches gardens at public libraries throughout the City. As Chairman of the New York Flower Show Committee, she was a driving and creative force in reestablishing the event. Most of all, we will miss her graciousness, her good cheer, and her warmth, which enveloped all who knew her. The Horticultural Society of New York
