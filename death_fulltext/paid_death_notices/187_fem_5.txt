        KAPETANAKIS-Betty. July 29, 2002. The staff, the Board of Directors, the Community Funding Board, the Advisory Board, and the grantee and donor community of the North Star Fund mourn the tragic death of our beloved Executive Director. We extend our most profound condolences to Betty's wonderful, loving and supportive family. A lifelong, tireless champion of social justice, gender, racial and sexual equality, workers' rights, empowerment, internationalism and peace, Betty was an inspiration to all of us in the progressive activist community. In her 15-year tenure at the North Star Fund she helped raise and distribute millions of dollars to thousands of grassroots organizations in New York City. She was our source of strength, our beacon, our North Star.
