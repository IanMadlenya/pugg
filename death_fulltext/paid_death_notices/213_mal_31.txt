        SILVERSTONE -- Horace (Ace). On September 26, 2004 at the age of 94. Born in New York City on April 23, 1910. Cherished and deeply appreciated by his daughters, Joan Greenfield and Carol Silverstone, son, Richard Silverstone, grandchildren, Lisabeth Hall, M.D., Adam and David Heckendorn, Gabe and David Silverstone, niece, Betty Sullivan and nephew, Walter J. Perner. He will be profoundly missed, yet his buoyant spirit, jokes and oneliners will be quoted by all who knew him and laughed with him. A member of NYSE for over 50 years, he started as a runner in 1925 at age 15. A family service will be held. There will also be a remembrance gathering at the Stock Exchange on Monday, October 18th.
