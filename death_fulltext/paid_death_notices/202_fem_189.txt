        WONG--Nancy E. (Leo). In Monroe, CT, formerly of Rye, NY, and Houston, TX, loving wife of Kellogg, mom of Eric, Leta, and Trina, grandma to four grandchildren. Began her journey peacefully on November 8, 2003 after keeping lung cancer at bay for many months through the practice of Medical Qigong as taught by Master Benhui He. Her work as artist, designer, church worker and teacher in spiritual energy enriched our lives. Her exceptional quiet beauty, compassion and unconditional love, touched the hearts and souls of many throughout the U.S. and Asia. A Founding Member of The Houston Chinese Baptist Church, she was also Deaconess, Elder, and Clerk of Sessions of the Rye Presbyterian Church. Those who miss her, take solace in the belief that she will resume her good works at a new time and place. A celebration of her life will be held at the Rye Presbyterian Church at 3 P.M. Saturday November 29, 2003. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made in her memory to the World Institute For Self Healing, 250 Lackland Drive, Suite 10, Middlesex, NJ 08846
