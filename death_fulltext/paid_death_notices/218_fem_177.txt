        WINSLOW--Sadie. The Board of Directors of Louise Wise Services deeply mourn the passing of Sadie Winslow, an esteemed member of our Board for over 50 years. A passionate advocate for human rights and an outspoken critic against social injustices, she always recognized the specific needs of young children and senior citizens and committed herself to improving their lives with unrelenting determination and dedication. Her career was distinguished by many accomplishments and by her leadership in the AfricanAmerican community. She served with great distinction on the boards of prominent civic organizations, educational institutions and charitable foundations. Her elegant manner, her wise counsel, her zest for life, and her loyalty to the Board will always be remembered. We extend our sincere sympathy to her niece and to the rest of her family and friends. Glenna Michaels, President Herman Bagley, Vice Pres.
