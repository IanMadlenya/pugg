        CHINN-C.O. Legendary Civil Rights figure in Canton, Mississippi. Afraid of no one, he gave courage to those around him, helping make Madison County the first covered by the '65 Voting Rights Act. He lived to see son Robert and daughter-in-law Mamie elected judges. He is survived by his wife, Minnie Lou, sons Robert and Henry Lee, grandchildren and great-granchildren with whom we share pride in knowing him and sorrow at his passing. Charney V. Bromberg William H. Forsyth, Jr. Tom Manoff
