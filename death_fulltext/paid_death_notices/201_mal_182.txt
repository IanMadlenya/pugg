        COSTELLO -- Timothy W. Adelphi University mourns the passing of our former President Timothy W. Costello. For 13 years he served with distinction as the University's sixth President, sharing his knowlege and commitment to educational excellence with the Adelphi community. Under his leadership, the University formed several new departments, launched its adult degree program, added the Derner Institute for Advanced Psychological Studies and built new facilities including the Olmsted Theatre and a new home for the School of Social Work. We will build upon his legacy through our commitment to the highest academic standards and civic-minded initiative. Our thoughts are with his son Peter, a member of our faculty, and the entire Costello family. Robert A. Scott, President Steven N. Fischer, Chairman The Adelphi University Board of Trustees
