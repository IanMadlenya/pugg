        KLEIN-Morton. The faculty and staff of the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science of Columbia University deeply mourn the loss of our dear friend and colleague, Morton Klein. Professor Klein was one of the first scholars to apply the analytical methods of operations research to industrial engineering. He was the driving force behind the development of the field of operations research and the creation of the Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at Columbia, where he taught for forty-five years. He was extraordinarily devoted to his Department and the thousands of students whose lives he touched during his long career. His legacy at Columbia will be long lasting. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his loving wife Gloria and family.
