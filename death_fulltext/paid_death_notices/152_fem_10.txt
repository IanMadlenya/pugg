        BOILLOT-Lynn Hochschild. The Trustees, faculty, staff and students of Paul Smith's, The College of the Adirondacks, mourn the loss of Lynn Hochschild Boillot, a leader among the College's Board of Trustees. An articulate advocate of the College's initiative to create a regional super-library, and a generous supporter of the College's scholarship fund, her insight and infectious spirit will be missed by the College community. She loved the Adirondacks and was passionate about the education of the region's young people. The combination, coupled with an enthusiasm and sense of humor matched by few, made her a joy with which to work. Our deepest sympathies are extended to her two sisters, Ann Poole and Patricia LaBalme, and her four sons and two daughters-in-law.
