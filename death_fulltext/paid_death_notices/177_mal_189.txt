        EIGEN-Morris. In memory of our father, a gentleman, who lived his life to the fullest and loved us enough to teach us to be independent while emphasizing decent, loving, charitable values. Judy and Lewis
        EIGEN-Morris. I consider myself both privileged and honored to be counted amongst Morris Eigen's friends. He was a person who had in equal measure wisdom and a sense of humor endowed in him, and a strong sense of not only knowing what is right, but being an epitome of it. Sashi Kumar, New Delhi, India. One of the most affectionate people I ever met and loved. Ritu Kumar
