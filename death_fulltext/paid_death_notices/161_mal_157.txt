        SEGAL-GEORGE. The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art are deeply saddened by the passing of George Segal, who added an element of private, inward-looking humanity to the often brash vocabulary of a new American Art that concentrated on commercial culture. Ghostly in appearance, his signature plaster figures yet managed to embrace a solid earthiness. Both the work and the artist will remain as widely liked and admired as they have for the past forty years. We extend our most sincere sympathy to his wife, Helen; his children, Rena and Jeffrey; and his brother, Morris. Ronald S. Lauder, Chairman Agnes Gund, President Glenn D. Lowry, Director The Museum of Modern Art
