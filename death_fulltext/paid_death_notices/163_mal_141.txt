        THOMASES-Fred. Temple Emanu-el of Englewood, New Jersey extends its deepest sympathy to Mrs. Florence Thomases and her children and grandchildren on the death, at the age of 92, of the head of the family, Fred Thomases. He was a central figure in our congregation and in the Jewish and civic communities for nearly 60 years. His good deeds were without number. We mourn the end of an exemplary life, and we rejoice in what he taught us. May his family be consoled among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
