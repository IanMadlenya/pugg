        deSIMONE--Jack. The Board of Trustees and staff of Carnegie Hall mourn the loss of our dear friend and colleague, Jack deSimone. Jack played a distinguished role in the history of Carnegie Hall. A tireless advocate on the Committee to Save Carnegie Hall, he joined the Board of Trustees of the newly formed Carnegie Hall Society in 1960, and became an Honorary Trustee in 1988. All of us at Carnegie Hall are grateful to Jack for his vision, his leadership and his love for this institution. We send our heartfelt condolences to his daughter, Diane; his brother, Anthony; his sister, Frances; and to his many friends. Sanford I. Weill, Chairman of the Board Clive Gillinson, Executive & Artistic Director
