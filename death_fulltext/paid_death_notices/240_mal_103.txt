        FEINERMAN--Rabbi Judah. The Yeshiva University/ RIETS family is saddened by the passing of a devoted alumnus who was widely recognized for his leadership on behalf of Jewish education. A past member of the YU Board of Trustees, he also served on the Board of Trustees of the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS) and was its Chair for many years. Heartfelt condolences are extended to his beloved wife, Ruth ''Shepsie'' Feinerman, who, with him, is a YU Guardian; to their children: Elliot (and Carol) Feinerman, Sharon (and Dr. Abraham) Herzberg, Rabbi Rodney (and Raisie) Feinerman, Ira (and Rabbi Sholom) Schlessel; to his sisters: Rickie (and Dr. Irving) Goldstein and Dr. Esther (and Rabbi Dr. Maurice) Wohlgelernter; and to his seventeen grandchildren and four greatgrandchildren. May the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel, President Dr. Norman Lamm Chancellor Morry J.
