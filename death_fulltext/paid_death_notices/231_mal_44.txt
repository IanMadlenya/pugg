        $(6$)KIERSTEAD -- Wilson. The residence and staff of 901 Lexington Avenue are thankful for his life that much enriched ours. As a neighbor and long-serving Board President, Wil shared with us his regard for the house and the men by judicious deployment of poise, wit, and common sense. Few communities are favored with so deft a disposer of spurious Gordonian Knots; 901 was thus endowed--as we continue to be by his family.
