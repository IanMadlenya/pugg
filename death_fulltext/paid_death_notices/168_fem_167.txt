        ENO-M. Kathryn. Friends mourn the loss of their dear friend, Kathryn. She died on January 15 after a lengthy illness. She will be remembered for her vitality and deeply missed by her countless friends, who worked with her in the State Dept. and MOMA, and those who knew her through the religious organizations to which she donated so much of her time and spiritual guidance. Kathryn was a world traveler, an avid reader, and a most wonderfully inspiring person. She will always be missed.
