        EWBANK-Weeb. The New York Jets have lost a great coach, a great mentor and a great friend. Weeb symbolized the best tradition and commitment and sportsmanship sought and admired in professional sports. His inspirational motivation and extraordinary management skills produced the unique record of winning championships in two leagues, and winning the hearts of everyone fortunate to have been associated with him over a 92 year lifetime.
