Professor Emerita (sociology), University of California, Santa Cruz; Norma had also been Senior Research Associate at the Institute for the Study of Social Change, University of California, Berkeley, and Bunting Fellow at Harvard University. She was founder and first director of the National Judicial Education Program to Promote Equality for Women and Men in the Courts (NJEP), sponsored by the NOW Legal and Education Fund and the National Association of Women Judges, which led to the creation of over fifty gender bias task forces for the state and federal courts, most of which were chaired by the Chief Justices of the state court systems. She was also a frequent advisor to court systems abroad. Her several overlapping careers included the sociology of the legal, medical, and military professions and the establishment of an organic pineapple industry in Costa Rica. Norma co-authored the first children's booklet on organic agriculture that is now used throughout Costa Rica's primary school system. She will be missed by her large and adoring family, by friends and colleagues worldwide, and by the children and working people of Rincon de Salas.
