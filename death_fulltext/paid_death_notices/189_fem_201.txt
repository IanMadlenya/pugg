        TIGER-Edith. We mourn Edith Tiger. For over a generation, Edith played a major role as Executive Director of the National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee in the never ending struggle to protect and extend civil liberties in the U.S. Working with our partner and ECLC's general counsel, the late Leonard B. Boudin, and with our firm, Edith and ECLC were in the forefront of the fight against McCarthyism and HUAC; provided legal counsel and support for the civil rights and peace movements; established essential legal support for political refugees from Haiti and other countries; and won recognition of important civil liberties, including the rights of Americans to travel internationally, to receive and read foreign journals and literature not approved by the government, and to invite and hear foreign visitors who wish to speak to U.S. audiences on subjects of public concern. We were honored to work with her on these and other critical issues and cases. Victor Rabinowitz Eric Lieberman Michael Krinsky Rabinowitz, Boudin, Standard, Krinsky & Lieberman
        TIGER - Edith. Beloved friend, pioneer in the ongoing struggle for human and civil rights. We travelled together deep into the heartland of Mississippi where we introduced youth to the events that lead to the signing of The Civil Rights Act that enabled black men and women to vote.
