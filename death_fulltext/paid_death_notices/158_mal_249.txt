        YANKAUER-William P. The Trustees, Faculty and Staff of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine and The Mount Sinai Hospital are profoundly saddened by the passing of our long-time friend and magnanimous donor William P. Yankauer, a staunch supporter of the Institution for many years. As an early member of the Committee of 1000 of the School of Medicine and a benefactor of the School from its founding days, he will be sorely missed. We extend our deepest sympathy to his nephew and other members of the Yankauer family. Helene L. Kaplan, Chairman Mount Sinai School of Medicine Stephen M. Peck, Chairman The Mount Sinai Hospital John W. Rowe, M.D., President Mount Sinai NYU Health Arthur H. Rubenstein, MBBCh., Dean, Mount Sinai School of Medicine
