        MAYER--Egon, Prof. We greatly mourn the passing of Prof. Egon Mayer, husband of Marcia Kramer Mayer, who is a member of the Board of Directors of the League Treatment Center. He was a Professor of Sociology at the Graduate Center at CUNY. Egon was born a week after his mother escaped from the Nazis in Hungary. He was a brilliant scholar devoted to the principles and spirit of Judaism. His work in the study of intermarriage has become a standard in the field. Egon was optimistic, calm and supportive of friends. He will be missed by his loving wife, Marcia, daughters, Daphne, Reina and Danielle, and his mother, Heddy. He and Marcia were an extraordinary couple linked in intellect, spirit and companionship. He will be deeply missed by all who knew and loved him. Services will be held Sunday, February 1st, 12 noon, at The Reconstructionist Synagogue of the North Shore, 1001 Plandome Road, Manhasset, New York, 516-627-6274.
