        WARD--Hon. Robert J. A wise and gentle man who was our dear friend. His sudden loss leaves a void in our lives that will be impossible to fill. Our hearts go out to Renee, Laura, Carolyn and family. They will be consoled in the years to come with so many wonderful memories. Diane and Arthur Abbey
