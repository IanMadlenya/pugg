        MAYNARD-Paul. The Aaron Copland School of Music at Queens College deeply mourns the death of its distinguished faculty member, professor emeritus Paul Maynard, extraordinary musician, harpsichordist, organist and conductor. Coming to the College from a long professional career as keyboard player and conductor of the pioneer American early music ensemble New York Pro Musica, Professor Maynard was for many years the conductor of the Queens College Choir, Vocal Ensemble, and Collegium Musicum. His great artistry and insightful teaching will be long remembered by faculty and generations of students. Raymond Erickson, Dean of Arts and Humanities Hubert S. Howe, Jr., Director Faculty, Staff and Students
