        WILLIAMS-John Hollingsworth. On February 27, 2000 in Santa Barbara California. He is survived by his son, John Williams Jr., daughters Elizabeth Williams and Johnna Williams, and by many friends of Bill W., on whose lives he had a profound effect and to whom he will be a power of example forever. Born in Washington DC in 1924, he served with distinction in World War II as a member of the 82nd Airborne, receiving the Bronze Star and Purple Heart for his heroic actions in the Battle of the Bulge. Upon his return from the war, he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale University. Mr. Williams retired from Morgan Guarantee Bank as Vice President for Special Health Services where he founded the program for providing counseling and assistance to employees suffering from alcoholism. He had served as Director of Public Relations at Pepsi-Cola Company prior to his work in the field of alcoholism. In 1967 he was named as Special Deputy on Alcoholism to the NYC Commissioner of Health and launched the first successful effort to open city hospital beds and to provide out-patient and aftercare services to alcoholics. Later, he created employee assistance programs for many of the Fortune 100 companies which are now a mainstay of corporate employee benefits programs.
