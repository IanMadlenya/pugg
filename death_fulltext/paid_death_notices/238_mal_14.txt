        GARDNER--Andrew. We mourn the untimely passing of our partner and friend, Andrew Gardner. Andrew brought energy and spirit to all that he did, whether in servicing clients' work, representing the indigent or mentoring our young lawyers. Andrew came to our firm as a summer associate in the summer of 1991 while still a student at NYU Law School, became an associate upon his graduation the following year, and became a partner in the firm in 2000. He handled every kind of litigation with great skill and perseverance. He earned a special place in the hearts of his clients and colleagues, and was well on his way to the front ranks of our profession. He will not be forgotten by any of us. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Kim, and their three children Jacob, Kyle and Juliet. We know that they will remain forever enriched by his life, as we all have. The Partners, Associates and Staff Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP
