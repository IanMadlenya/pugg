        PUGH-F.C. Richmond, 82. Died Saturday, February 16, 2002. He was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, on March 27, 1919, the son of Dr. and Mrs. Walter N. Pugh. He attended Wasatch Elementary School, East High School, and the University of Utah where he received a B.A. Degree. Following college, he enlisted in the Army in order to serve in WWII achieving the rank of Captain by the time he was discharged. After the war, he earned his M.B.A. at Harvard University. He was employed by Mobile Oil Corporation for 27 years in their Marketing Department, first in Los Angeles and later in New York City. He retired in 1974 and moved to Chatham Township, NJ. An avid fly fisherman, he was a member of The Flat Rock Club of Mack's Inn, Idaho, where he fished annually for over 50 years. His devotion to fishing encompassed a reverence for the outdoors and the beauty of the wild. Rich was a jokester of the first order, and a gamesman of no small skill. He will finally be remembered for his quick wit and love of chess, handcarved wooden jigsaw puzzles and The New York Times crossword puzzles. Rich was also no stranger to the good life, enjoying a fine meal, a good beer, his ubiquitous cigar and a clever story. He is survived by his sister and her husband, Muriel and George Baker, also of Chatham Township, NJ, and two nieces, Melody G. Baker of Basking Ridge, NJ, and Melissa B. Connelly of Salt Lake City, Utah, as well as five grandnieces and nephews. No services are planned as this is what Rich wanted. Those who wish may make a donation in his memory to the Chatham Public Library, 214 Main Street, Chatham, N.J., 07928.
