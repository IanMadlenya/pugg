        GRILL--Max. Yeshiva University and Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS) mourn the passing at 105 years of our humble giant in good deeds. A Benefactor with his late wife Marion, he named the Max and Marion Grill Deanship at RIETS, and a host of scholarships at the university's undergraduate and graduate schools, and at the Yeshiva University High Schools to ensure future generations of knowledgeable and committed Jewish leaders for our community and nation. A CPA of renown for his integrity, he was admired and revered by all who knew him. His kindness, compassion, and gentle manner, as well as his sharp wit and humor enriched the lives of all his family and friends. May his many beloved nieces, nephews and kinsmen as well as his devoted executors, Dr. Jay Barnett and Robert Metzger, find solace among those who mourn for Zion and Jerusalem. His memory will live on forever within our institution. Richard M. Joel, President Norman Lamm, Chancellor Morry J.
