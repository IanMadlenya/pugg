        WEIN--Stewart A. On March 27, 2004. Never was there such an adoring husband to Ina, father to Marc, Evan and Terri, Ilene and Adam, grandfather to Michael, Alex, Samantha, Maxwell, Casey, Julia, Nicholas, Brett and Lauren, brother to Donald and Dorothy. We will never forget his sense of humor, gracious generosity, caring and friendly spirit.
        WEIN--Stewart. The Hochfelder, Cohen and Lerner families are all so saddened by the sudden loss of our dear Stewie. We will miss his company, charm, wit, smile and true compassion for others that made him such a treasure. Our heartfelt sympathies to his adoring wife Ina, and to his devoted children, Evan and Terri, and beautiful grandchildren Max, Julia, Nicholas and Lauren, as well as the entire Wein family. Our thoughts and prayers are with you, and we love you.
