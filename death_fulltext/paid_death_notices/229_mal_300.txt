        FELD--Herman, 86. After a valiant long struggle, ''Hy'' passed away February 19th. He was a most devoted husband to Lillian for 61 years and an extremely proud father to Adam (Debbie), Ross (Ellen) and Susan (both predeceased). His grandchildren Aaron, Zachary, Nicole and Joshua greatly enriched his life. He was highly intelligent and had a great wit and sense of humor. He loved golf, classical and jazz music and art. He dearly loved his predeceased brother Alfred (Harriett). Together, their infamous humor provided us with endless hilarity. All his nieces and nephews were deeply loved. His closest relatives were his sister-in-law, Sarah, brother-in-law, Greg and sister-in-law, Harriett (Alfred). We are mourning him now and miss him deeply but, with our greatest love we will forever celebrate and treasure his very special life. Lillian Feld, Adam, Debbie, Nicole, Joshua Feld, Ellen (Ross), Aaron, Zachary Feld
