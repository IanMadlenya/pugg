His employees and staff have been inspired by him and will carry forward the excellence he instilled in all of us. Our hearts go out to his mother, Pat Jordan and brother, Jeff Jordan. Rest in peace.

        JORDAN--Greg. Greg Jordan. The laughter. All those laughs. Laughing so hard you can't take a breath. The grin. Ear to ear. Naughty and with a huge twinkle in his eye, blinding us, and the laughter begins again. How fortunate and lucky and blessed we were to have had him here with us, however brief. There won't be one happy time where the memory and the image of Greg laughing, and we laughing with him, will ever leave us. Cari, Boman, Ruby & Matthew Modine
