        KERN-Robert, 65, a Professor of History at The University of New Mexico, died of cancer on April 15, 2000. He had taught at UNM for over 30 years. He graduated with a B.A. from Antioch College, obtained an MA and Ph.D in History from The University of Chicago. Of Mr. Kern's ten books, his dissertation provided the material for two of the earliest, both of which dealt with the problems connected with the modernization of political structures in the Spanish speaking world. He later created and coedited ''The Historical Dictionary of Modern Spanish History'' and ''The Regions Of Spain: An Historical And Cultural Guide''. His study of The Spanish Civil War, ''Red Years/Black Years: A Political History Of The Spanish Anarchists, 1911 To 1937'', was particularly well-known. In addition, Mr. Kern wrote about New Mexico, and his ''Labor History Of New Mexico'', was published by the UNM Press. He co-edited with Jane Slaughter, one of the first collections to deal with women in radical politics, ''European Women On The Left''.
