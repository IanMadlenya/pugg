        SMIALY-Szloma. Together with Hena, Sylvia, David, Rachel and Raphael, we mourn the death of their beloved and devoted husband, father and zayde, and our unforgettable friend. Throughout his life before, during and after the Holocaust, he personified all that was beautiful and sacred of European Jewry. His dignity, integrity, and love for his family, friends and the Jewish people are an inspiration to all who were privileged to know him. Jeanie, Menachem and Jodi Rosensaft
