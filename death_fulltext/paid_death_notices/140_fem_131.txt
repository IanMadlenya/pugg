        FOSCARINIS-Rosa, MD. The Faculty and Staff of New York University School of Medicine deeply mourns the loss of our esteemed colleague, Rosa Foscarinis, MD, Clinical Associate Professor of Pediatrics. Dr. Foscarinis died in a car accident in Athens, Greece on August 21, 1998. She was 82. Dr. Foscarinis was affiliated with NYU for about 4 decades. After earning her MD degree from the School of Medicine of the National University of Athens in 1940, she came to the US to pursue specialty training. She completed a residency in pediatrics at Gouverneur Hospital in 1950 and at NYU's University Hospital (formerly called New York Post-Graduate Hospital) in 1951. Dr. Foscarinis served as a dedicated, compassionate assisting attending in pediatrics at both the NYU Medical Center and Bellevue Hospital. She was also an attending in pediatric allergy at Gouverneur Hospital. We extend our sympathies to Dr. Foscarinis' husband Nicolas, her daughter Maria and all the members of the Foscarinis family. In lieu of flowers the family would appreciate contributions to the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, 918 F Street N.W., Suite 412, Washington, DC, 20004. Wade P. Parks, PhD, MD Pat & John Rosenwald Professor of Pediatrics and Chairman of The Department, NYU School of Medicine
