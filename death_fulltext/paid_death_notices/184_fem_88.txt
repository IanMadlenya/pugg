        FADLOUN-Aline. On Friday, April 12, after complications from heart surgery operation. Cherished sister, aunt and grand-aunt, loved by all. She emigrated from Egypt as a persecuted refugee in 1962 and became a proud American. We will always remember her for her large spirit, her generosity, and her concern for everyone. We miss you very much Tante Alina. Your love and good advice will remain with us forever. Joyce
