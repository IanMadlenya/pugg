        POLANSKY-Mollie. She was a woman of such strength of character that even the powerful were humble in her presence. Her selflessness was unparalleled. Her kindness knew no bounds. Her commitment was such that she could move mountains. Her loss is incalculable to so many. I thank her for having been my friend. Judy Piesco
