        BOGART--Leo. We mourn the death of Dr. Leo Bogart, sociologist and media and public opinion and marketing expert, whose prodigious written work included 11 books. He died at Mount Sinai Hospital on Saturday, October 15, after a 10-week bout with Babesiosis. He was 84. Just prior to his death he was re-reading Thomas Mann's ''Magic Mountain'' in the original German, one of the many languages he had mastered. He leaves his wife of 57 years, Agnes Bogart; two children, Michele H. Bogart, Professor of Art History at Stony Brook University, Long Island, and Dr. Gregory Charles Bogart of Richmond, Calif.; and one grandchild, Nicholas Bogart Pauly. His sonin-law, Dr. Philip Pauly of Rutgers University, is also an important member of the Bogart family. We have been deeply influenced by this dear man's integrity, courage, and love of the arts. We hope to continue his contributions to civic causes and to read his beloved newspapers. Leo Bogart's life will be celebrated at a November party of friends and associates.
