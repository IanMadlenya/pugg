        YOSKOWITZ--Jay. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) are stunned and saddened by the sudden and tragic loss of our much-loved and respected colleague, Jay Yoskowitz, senior vice president/campaign. Jay's keen mind and his warmth, humor, character and lifetime dedication to Israel and the Jewish people made him an invaluable asset to our organization. Since 1999, he gave professional direction to our campaign, supervising regional staff in 17 cities around the U.S. and working closely with our ATS management team, national leadership and our Technion colleagues. The success of our ''Shaping Israel's Future'' campaign is a tribute to his exemplary skills as a leader and his ability to inspire others to believe in the cause to which he was so deeply committed. Jay joined the ATS family with a long and distinguished record of Jewish communal service, having served in top professional positions in the Council of Jewish Federations, United Israel Appeal, the Jewish National Fund and the B'nai B'rith Youth Organization. He also served as an executive at the Jewish Federations in Des Moines, Iowa and Greenwich, Connecticut. In 2004, in recognition of his lifelong work on behalf of Israel and the American Jewish community, he received an honorary doctorate from Hebrew Union College and the Mandelkorn Distinguished Service Award from the Association of Jewish Community Organization Personnel. An outstanding professional and human being, his passing leaves a tremendous void. We extend our deepest sympathy to his beloved wife, Janet, and his children, Joy, Rebecca, and Seth and his wife Karen; his brother Rabbi Herbert Yoskowitz; and the entire family. A memorial fund is being established in Jay's name at the American Technion Society, 55 East 59th Street, NY, NY 10022. American Society for Technion-Israel Institute of Technology Stephen A.
