        HOVAKIMIAN-Aram. The patients and staff of the Division of Substance Abuse of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine are saddened to learn of the death of Aram Hovakimian, their recently retired mentor and colleague. Aram worked in our field for almost thirty years, working for Beth Israel Medical Center and the City of New York before he came to Einstein. He served over 10 years as Patient Advocate and always reminded us of why we are here-to help our patients with healthier and happier lives. We will always remember his wisdom and dedication to substance abuse treatment and rehabilitation. Ira J. Marion, Exec Director Constantine Gotsis, MD, Medical Director
