        PLATOVSKY-Naftali. We mourn the passing of our father, Rabbi Naftali Platovsky. He was a man of few words with a great sense of humor. His strength of character assisted his family through the hardships encountered in Eastern Europe. He fulfilled his lifelong dream by transporting his mother's remains from Siberia to Israel for reburial. He will be loved and remembered by his family and all of the people whose lives he touched.
