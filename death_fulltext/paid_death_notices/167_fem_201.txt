        MAGSAYSAY-Teresita. On behalf of the Teachers College, Columbia University community I want to express my deepest sympathies to the family of Teresita (Tess) Magsaysay and Ken Boxley on the untimely death of our dear friend Tess. She was a graduate of Teachers College and her field of study was applied linguistics. With her husband, Ken, she supported a one-of-a-kind scholarship to attract the best and the brightest to the teaching profession. There are few people so committed to education as Tess, and few so lovely in character and mind. We will miss her. Arthur E. Levine, President Teachers College, Columbia Univ
