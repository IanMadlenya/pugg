        CAGNER-Nathan. To our adored Grandpa. We will always remember the smiles and happiness that Grandpa brought to us at every occasion. From sharing a great breakfast with him at Mom's Kitchen to learning how to hit a golf ball with perfect ease, his ways were both comforting and lasting. His journey through life has touched many people, places, and certainly years-but it is our hearts, the hearts of his grandchildren most of all, that he has touched the most. We will always love you. Love, Adam, Lana, Evan, Michele, Dana, Rachel, and Eric
        CAGNER-Nathan. Beloved husband to Doris. Wonderful father to Bruce and Carol Cagner, Phyllis and Steven Platin. Loving grandfather to Adam, Lana, Evan, Michelle, Dana, Rachel and Eric. We will have a lifetime of memories.
