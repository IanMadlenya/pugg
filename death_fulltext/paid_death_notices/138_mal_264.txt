        MAYER-Rev. Joseph. We mourn the passing of East Midwood Jewish Center's devoted and longtime associate cantor, a superb Ba-al Koreh, whose dedication to Jewish life and learning will continue to inspire his wife, Anne, devoted family and generations of Bar and Bat Mitzvah students whom he taught and influenced. As a man of tradition, integrity and honesty, he enobled us all. May the families be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Chavurah East Midwood Jewish Center Ruth Altman, President
