        SHERMAN -- Peter. The Board, officers and staff of United Cerebral Palsy of NYC note with profound sorrow the passing of our benefactor and friend, Peter Sherman, President of The Joseph LeRoy and C. Warner Fund. His is a rich legacy: A fully accessible playground at our Millicent V. Hearst Children's Center in Brooklyn, the renovation and expansion of services at our Brooklyn Health Care Clinic, the renovation of our Manhattan SHARE Center, and, most recently, a grant for equipment upgrade at our NYC Regional TRAID Centers in Brooklyn and Manhattan. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Jo Ann Ferdinand, his son Danny, and his entire family. Martin Hausman, President Edward R. Matthews, Executive Director Ronald J.H. Napal, Chief Development Officer UCP of NYC
        SHERMAN -- Peter. Dear friend, loyal supporter of services to children. Your wise counsel made you a wonderful Foundation Trustee. Brooklyn Public Library
