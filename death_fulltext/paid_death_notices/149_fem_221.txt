        FARBER-Joan. We deeply mourn the death of our dear friend. She was thoroughly delightful, with a quirky sense of humor, very smart, very loving, the sweetest person we have ever known. Our warmest thoughts are with her dear husband Alfie, their wonderful children Ben and Annie, her father, Daniella, and all those who love her as we do. We'll miss Joan very much and will always smile when we think of her. Abbe and Rich, Marj and Cynthia
