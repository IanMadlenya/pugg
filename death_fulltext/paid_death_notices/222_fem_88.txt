She taught Hebrew classes at Morristown High School and in area adult education programs. Helen was a longtime member of Morristown Jewish Center Beit Yisrael, where she chanted the Haftorahs with great feeling. She wrote poetry from the time she was a young girl and passed on her love of languages and books to her children. Helen graced all who knew her with her quiet eloquence.
