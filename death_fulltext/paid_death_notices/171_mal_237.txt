        NACK-Saul H. The Etzion Foundation expresses its deepest condolences on the passing of Mr. Saul H. Nack. A loving husband, father, grandfather and friend, he served with distinction and humility as President of the B'Nai Israel Jewish Centre. Together with his life partner Frieda, Mr. Nack and B'Nai Israel have provided significant support to Jewish Education, and we gratefully acknowledge his support of Yeshivat Har Etzion. May the Nack family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Rabbi Dr. Aharon Lichtenstein Rabbi Yehuda Amital Moshe Moshkovitz
