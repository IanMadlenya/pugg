        WHITNEY--David. We are deeply saddened by the loss of David, and the art world has lost a great friend. The Franz Kline exhibition at the Whitney Museum in 1994-1995, and the Willem de Kooning retrospective at the Gagosian Gallery last year, both of which David curated, showed his great sensitivity and compassion for artists and their work. We will miss his warmth, his brilliance, his humor and his extraordinary eye. Jo Carole and Ronald S. Lauder
        WHITNEY--David. The Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board mourns the loss of our brilliant colleague, David Whitney, 1939--2005.
