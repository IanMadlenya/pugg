        ELAZAR-Daniel. The Officers and Staff of United Jewish Communities deeply mourn the passing of Dr. Daniel Elazar, Professor at Bar Ilan and Temple University and Founder of The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs. Dr. Elazar was passionate in his committment to the Jewish people, Jerusalem and Israel. Among his many contributions to organized Jewish life is his legacy of organizational analysis that includes The Jewish Agency for Israel and the Federation system. Dr. Elazar brought a spirit of compassion, generosity and dedication to all of his work, enriching the lives of all he touched. He will be sorely missed. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his entire family. May they be comforted among those who mourn for Zion and Jerusalem. Charles R. Bronfman, UJC Chairman of the Board Joel D.
