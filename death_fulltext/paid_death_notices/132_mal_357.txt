        FRANK-Jack. On January 24, 1998. Past President of The Retired School Supervisors and Administrators Local 1R AFSA. Jack Frank was a giant of a man. I am not speaking about stature, I am speaking about intellect, character and being a fine person. Jack loved life and he loved his work. He was respected and loved in the education community. He was a superb principal. His school ranked very high in achievement. He was an innovator and he knew just what the children needed to succeed in life. He was a teacher of teachers. He was loved by those of us who were fortunate to know him. He will be missed. I can only say goodbye old friend, we will always remember you. Leonard Blumberg, President of Retired School Supervisors and Aadministrators, Local 1R AFSA
