Dear sister of Eleanor Leff and Irving Wiesen and sister-in-law of Tobie, Shirley and Mae Wiesen. ''Cookie'' was a former member of the Jewish Theological Seminary Board of Overseers and active with The United Jewish Appeal, The National Council of Jewish Women and Brandeis University. She received the Haym Solomon Award from the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith ''For her unswerving dedication to humanitarian and spiritual values.'' Lilly was a fine pianist and gave concerts in Town Hall and Palm Beach. Cookie believed in living life to the fullest. With her marvelous sense of humor, great compassion, love of art, dancing, music and everything exciting and interesting, she was a joy to be with.
