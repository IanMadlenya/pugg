        ISAACSON-Ruth. Of Manhattan, on November 12. Beloved mother of Donna and Lynn, sister of Blanche and Alvin Smith, aunt of Susan, Carol, and Laura, and grandmother of Hanna Frankel. She comes to this greatest of journeys well prepared, for she was a gallant and resourceful world traveler, always questing, curious, eager, and fascinated.
