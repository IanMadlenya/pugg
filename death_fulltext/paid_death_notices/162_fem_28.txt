        HELLMAN-Martha D. Age 78. The Hellman family mourns with deep sorrow the passing of Martha D. Hellman, beloved wife of the late Dr. Morton J. Hellman. Martha succumbed on July 5, 2000 after a long illness. She is survived by her lifelong friend and cherished companion, Bernard Rothenberg, sister Florence Ress, loving sons Paul, Charles and George, daughters-in-law Holly and Sarah, and grandson Gregory. As a loving and kind spouse, mother, and friend, and as a gracious, refined lady who lived life with style and verve, Martha was an inspiration to us all and will be sorely missed. Services will be held at 12:15PM on Thursday, July 6 at Riverside Memorial Chapel at 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue.
