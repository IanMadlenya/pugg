        WEISENFELD-Mildred. Prevent Blindness America mourns the passing of Mildred Weisenfeld, founder of Fight For Sight. In 1988 Prevent Blindness America and Fight For Sight affiliated in mutual support of Mildred's unswerving fight against vision loss. Since 1946, Mildred raised millions of dollars to bring bright young scientists into the field of research. Considering all the discoveries made by the thousands of investigators who received their initial support from Mildred, hers was a life of incalculable achievement. The 35,000 volunteers of Prevent Blindness America, its staff and the people whose lives she touched will miss Mildred deeply. Kent D. Stuckey Chairman of the Board Prevent Blindness America
