        RIVERA--Gilbert. The Partners of Pryor, Cashman, Sherman & Flynn LLP mourn the passing of Gilbert Rivera, one of the great citizens of Brooklyn and this nation. He was the paradigm of American ethic that rewards hard work, intelligence, initiative, courage and integrity. He leaves the world he inhabited a better place, but sadly he was struck down tragically in his prime. We express our condolences to his beloved wife, Erminia and his children, Gilbert, Jr. and Kevin. As well as his brothers, William and Raymond and the entire AM&G family. E.
