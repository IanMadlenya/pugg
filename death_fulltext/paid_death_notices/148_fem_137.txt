        QUASH-Rhoda. The Board of Governors, Administration and the entire Sound Shore Medical Center family deeply mourn the passing of Rhoda Quash. As the Medical Center's Director of Government Affairs, Ms. Quash was an effective and tireless advocate for providing the highest quality patient care to all who sought it. She collaborated skillfully with her colleagues in both City and State government to enact legislation that promoted access to affordable health care, build our City and enhance the quality of life for all its residents. Her contributions to the City of New Rochelle, including the creation of the Summer Jobs Program for young people and expanding employment opportunities for African American citizens, are permanent legacies that will reap benefits for future generations. We will always remember her strength and dignity under pressure, her willingness to forge ahead and overcome insurmountable obstacles and her beautiful smile. We will greatly miss her. We extend our deepest sympathy to her husband Tom, son Quentin and all the members of her family. Clark E. Walter, Chairman Board of Governors John R. Spicer, President and Chief Executive Officer Sound Shore Medical Center of Westchester
