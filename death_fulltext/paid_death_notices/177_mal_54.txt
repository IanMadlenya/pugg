        KAHAN-Michael. The City University of New York mourns the untimely passing of Michael Kahan, esteemed Professor of Political Science at Brooklyn College since 1973, and University Fellow for Special Projects this year. A popular teacher and dedicated mentor, his classes on the American Presidency and Middle East Affairs were always oversubscribed. He was a passionate advocate for CUNY's educational mission. Professor Kahan was a member of the University Faculty Senate Executive Committee, scholar, expert and commentator on local and national politics, and activist in national debates over issues such as gun control, school vouchers, and affirmative action. We extend our deepest condolences to his beloved family. He will be sorely missed. Benno C. Schmidt, Jr. Vice Chairman Board of Trustees Matthew Goldstein, Chancellor
