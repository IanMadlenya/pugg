        SENDAK--Gussie Weiss, 78, on May 7, 2004. The family is deeply saddened by the passing of our cherished sister-inlaw and aunt, Gussie. She was the beloved wife of the late author Jack Sendak, and daughter-in-law of author Philip Sendak and his wife, Sarah, both deceased. Gussie was born in Brooklyn but lived most of her life in Clarksburg, New Jersey, where she resided until her death. She met her husband when they both worked for Emerson Radio, and was very supportive of his writing career throughout his life. Her humor and friendship will be missed by her sister-inlaw, Natalie Lesselbaum of Delray Beach, FL, and by her brother-in-law, Maurice Sendak.
