        WILSON-Gwendolen (Mrs. Don B). Almost 88. Died unexpectedly, but quickly Saturday, January 3, 1998 at NYU Hospital after short illness this Fall. This followed a long, and very full active life throughout the world. An ardent New Yorker at heart, she was active in many local organizations, including The National Board of Film Review, The Tudor City Resident Association and the DBE. She will be sorely missed by her daughter Brandon (aka Jill), her son-in-law Steven and her two young grandsons Blake and Kyler.
