        McCABE-Eugene. Since North General Hospital's inception, we have had the pleasure of working with a great leader of people and fulfiller of dreams. As few others, if any, could, he was able to reconcile his mandate for pragmatism with his compassion for the Hospital's client community and its employees, and he did so with immeasurable and unfailing grace. Our warmest wishes are extended to Elsie, his children, and his North General family. Rosenbluth & Rosenbluth Labor Counsel
