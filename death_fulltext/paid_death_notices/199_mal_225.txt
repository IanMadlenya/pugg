        JIRANEK--David. Avid theater producer, passionate and visionary humanitarian, loyal and generous friend. With a phenomenal spirit, keen intellect, irresistible charm, and wry, ironic humor, he embraced life enthusiastically and made it more fun for those of us lucky enough to know him. His death out of time leaves a void in the lives of his producing partners, colleagues and friends as we contemplate a world without his unique personality. We are filled with sadness for Cricket, Cat and Sailor. We extend our deepest condolences to the entire Jiranek and Hooper families. Anne Squadron & Eric Krebs
