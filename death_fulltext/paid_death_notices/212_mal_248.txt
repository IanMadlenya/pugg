        PEARL--Leonard P., 82, advertising executive, artist. Leonard Pearl died at home on September 18. He was President of Leonard Pearl, Inc., an advertising agency in Manhattan, whose clients included Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall. Immediately after graduating from CCNY in 1942, Leonard enlisted in the army in World War II, serving in the Pacific. His creativity emerged at CCNY, where, near completion of a chemical engineering degree he decided to pursue his studies in art, ultimately graduating with a fine arts degree. A renaissance man, Mr. Pearl's artistic talents extended to building fine furniture, but, always modest about his extraordinary skills, he built it only for his family's personal use. Later in life he discovered his passion for sailing and became a Commodore of the Hempstead Sailing Club, racing his sailboat until his health no longer permitted. Survived by his wife Claudia, daughter Alison Edelman, son Steven Pearl, a comedian in Los Angeles, and sister Rhoda Lubalin. Leonard's pride and joy was his only grandchild, David Edelman, 13.
