        VLADECK--Judith P. It is with profound sadness that we mourn the passing of our beloved Senior Partner, Judith P. Vladeck. Mrs. Vladeck was a pioneer for justice in the workplace and a true giant of the profession. In the course of her 60 year career, Mrs. Vladeck handled many benchmark cases dealing with sex, race and age discrimination and fearlessly challenged entire industries to change their ways. The efforts of Mrs. Vladeck did much to shape the labor laws of this country and improve the treatment of employees. Mrs. Vladeck touched the lives of countless clients and colleagues with her wise counsel and her thoughtful mentoring. We will never forget her. We extend our deepest sympathies to her daughter and our partner Anne, as well as her sons Bruce and David and her five grandchildren.
