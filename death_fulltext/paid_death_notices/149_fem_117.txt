        DONALDSON-Jacqueline. A graduate of Smith College and Columbia University. Lived a life surrounded by all things beautiful. Her love of art, literature, music, and animals helped her live well in spite of her long illness with cancer. Jacqueline was a loving, independent and intellectual person who I will miss greatly. She taught me the greatest lesson-to be happy with yourself. Rest peacefully my dear make-believe grandmother. Anne Valle
