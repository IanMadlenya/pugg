        BARASH--Helene F. When a man gets married he has a wife and starts a family. I had all that, but also I had an instant mom. You were always there for me as my own mother was. Your love and strength for our family will never be something I will forget, but something I will greatly miss. I will always remember the joy and happiness you brought into my house every time you walked in. Your memory will always be in my heart. Arnold
        BARASH--Helene F. Mom, words can never express how I feel about you. Our love and devotion for each other was such a rare and beautiful gift that I will cherish in my heart forever. You will be deeply missed for your strength, beauty, and compassion for those around you. I will miss you so, but never forget all that you mean to me. I am so thankful for all that we had. Rest in peace. Andrea
