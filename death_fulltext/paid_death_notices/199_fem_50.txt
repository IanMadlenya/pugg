        POST--Jeannette S. The family of Jeannette S. Post acknowledges with deep sadness the loss of its beloved wife, sister, mother, grandmother and great-grandmother. Born in Brooklyn in 1913, she grew up with her parents, sister and two brothers behind the family's grocery store. She graduated from Long Island University in 1933 and from Brooklyn Law School in 1936, becoming one of the few women attorneys of her generation. Jeannette successfully combined a general law practice with her roles as wife to the late Bernard S. Post, a prominent physician and professor of rehabilitation medicine, and mother of three children. She was active in Brooklyn politics before moving to Kings Point, NY, where she participated in local government, serving as president of the Kings Point Civic Association. Jeannette was an authentic original and leaves the legacy of her keen intelligence, unflinching honesty, unfailing elegance, boundless generosity and unconditional love for all those whose lives she touched. She is survived by her twin brother, Israel Dolgin; her children, Gerard and Linda Post, Kalmon and Linda Farber Post, and Shari and Mitchell Buchbinder; her grandchildren, Illana and Lawrence Raia, Stacie and Mark Thompson, Andrew and Jodi Buchbinder, Brett Post, Kim and Rodney Khazzam, Brooke and Jeno Tamas, Alexander and Lauren Post, and Hallie Buchbinder; and her great-grandchildren, Sophia and Lawrence Raia, Samantha Buchbinder, Alexa Khazzam, and Samuel Tamas. She will be deeply missed and her memory will be a lasting treasure. The funeral will be held at Riverside-Nassau North Chapels, 55 N. Station Plaza in Great Neck, NY on August 10th at 11 AM.
