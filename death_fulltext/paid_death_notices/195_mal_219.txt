        COLE-Hugh. Of Basking Ridge, N.J. and Vero Beach, FL, died on Thursday in Vero Beach. He was 81. The cause was emphysema and lung fibrosis. A born and bred New Yorker, Mr. Cole attended prep school in New York City where he achieved Diamond Belt status in boxing. He then entered Columbia University, but left to serve in the 7th Fleet in WW II. He was a true patriot and loved his country dearly. He leaves behind his wife of 57 years, Sally Igoe Cole and four children, Sara Alvaro, Elizabeth Finegan, Maryjo Paz y Mino, Hugh Jr., and twelve grandchildren. Daughter Mary Ashley died in 1998. Mr. Cole was a magical father who could make a trip to a delicatessen into an unforgettable adventure. He spoiled his children (not really) by making every Saturday a Present Day. His story-telling is legendary. Mr. Cole was President of Igoe Brothers, Inc., a wire and steel manufacturer, where he was in the forefront in dealing in the Eastern European open market in the trading of steel rods. He traveled extensively in his work. He served on the Manpower Commission of the State of New Jersey under Governor Hughes, and was a Director of Carteret Savings and Loan, among others. Mr. Cole was a man of diverse tastes from caviar to Tootsie Rolls. He felt equally at home at the Stork Club and the Point Pleasant Boardwalk, dining at the Four Seasons or eating at the diner. We will really miss him. Donations may be made to the VNA Hospice House of Indian River County in Vero Beach, FL. 32960.
