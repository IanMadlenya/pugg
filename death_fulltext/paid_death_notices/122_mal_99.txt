Born in Hungary on May 26, 1896, he emigrated to the U.S. in 1923, and lived in NYC for 71 years before moving to Houston, TX, to live near his son. A pioneer in color motion picture film processing, he worked for 39 years at the Deluxe Laboratories in NYC, and had a wide reputation in the business for doing it right the first time. He was a Sunday school teacher and trustee at the First Presbyterian Church of Whitestone, NY, and also worked with the Boy Scouts, serving as a district commissioner. A prolific writer (unpublished), his works gave him great pleasure in his later years. Vincent was preceded in death by his wife, Madeline in 1976. He is survived by daughter, Audrienne C. Toomey and her husband William; son, Eric Grunert and his wife, Shirley; grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and the many friends his life touched. A Memorial Service was held in Houston on March 6, 1997. His remains will be interred next to his wife at Pinelawn, Long Island. Those wishing to pay their respects may contact his daughter at 1013 Hobbs Drive, Colesville, MD 20904.
