        ELKON-Frances. The Yeshiva University family mourns the passing of a highly respected member of the Jewish community, a dear friend who was dedicated to the advancement of Jewish education and the medical sciences. She and her late first husband, S. Max, are YU Guardians and Founders of our Albert Einstein College of Medicine. They established fellowships at our affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary for a scholar in residence on the Jack and Pearl Resnick Campus in the Bronx. Carrying on the family legacy are children, Marilyn (and Robert) Weinberg and Francine (and Ralph) Friedlander, YU Guardians who also established RIETS fellowships. We extend our heartfelt condolences to children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University Robert M. Beren, Chairman YU Board of Trustees
