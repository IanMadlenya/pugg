        LEVINGSON-Alfred. The Board of Directors of 180 Tenants Corporation wishes to extend our deepest sympathies to our dear neighbor, Ruth, and her family on the passing of Alfred Levingson. Alfred brought to his many years of service on our Board, both as a member and as long-time President, the wisdom, compassion and gentle humor that characterized his entire life. He will be sorely missed by his fellow Board members and by all of his friends and neighbors at 180 East End Avenue.
