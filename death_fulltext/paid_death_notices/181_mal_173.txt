        McKINNEY-Robert S. Age 60. Of Manhattan, died February 11, 2002. Raised in Bayside, Queens, the son of a New York City Police Detective, he had a long, impressive career in computer systems, rising to Chief Information Officer of top financial services institutions. After graduating the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, N.Y., he circumnavigated the globe at a young age before earning a Master's degree from Columbia University & embarking on his meteoric career. Far more impressive, however, was his passionate commitment to those he loved. He is survived by his wife Janet Robilotti, whose marriage to him was an epic and perpetual honeymoon, his sons Robert, Richard, James and Glenn, his daughter Meredith and his stepson James Robilotti, as well as daughters-in-law Gina, Cindy, Karissa and Kim, and six grandchildren: Alexandra, Isabella, Julia, Scott, Ryan and Jack, who were enchanted by his guitar playing and his totally uninhibited affection for them. Bob McKinney's children saw their father drop all other commitments to be there in times of need, and heard his encouragement and love in times of peace. He was the loving, courageous father all children deserve but not enought get to have. An expert sailor and private pilot, he and his wife loved soaring in his plane and being on the water. They adventured in Honduras and Central America and cherished their jogs throught Manhattan together. He leaves behind an unfathomable void, but no regrets, as he always told those close to him how much he loved them and delighted in hearing it back. A memorial service will be held Saturday, February 23rd, 2PM at Church of Saint Luke in the Field, 487 Hudson St, N.Y.C. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the New York City Rescue Mission, 299 Broadway, Room 1318, New York, N.Y. 10007, Attention: G. McKinney.
