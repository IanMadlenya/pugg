        LEET-Glen F. Glen Leet's belief in others transformed thousands of lives. The Trickle Up Program that he started with his wife Mildred Robbins Leet in 1979 has enabled more than 350,000 of the world's poor to start businesses and build new lives. And, all this with initial grants of only $50. It has been an honor to know and work with him. Alice Allen
