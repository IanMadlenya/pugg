        HANK-Susan. Beloved daughter of Selma Horowitz, loving sister of Barbara Horowitz and John Meyer, cherished sister-in-law of Ralph Slone, devoted aunt of David Slone, wonderful friend to so many, and especially Mommy to her ''girls'' Rose and June Ann. Susan held leadership positions in refugee resettlement organizations and with numerous charities. She was a Member of the Board of the Krohns Disease Foundation and was a benefactress to many charities related to Krohns disease and animal welfare. Susan was a partner in Hank-Kross Ltd., a legal recruitment firm in New York. In a difficult and often non-feeling business, she exhibited integrity and compassion. A most remarkable woman, she will be remembered for her keen intelligence, her generous spirit, her strong moral and religious convictions, and her hilarious wit. Services will be held at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76 Street, at Amsterdam Avenue at 9:30 A.M., today. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the ASPCA in the memory of Susan H. Hank. All her family and friends.
