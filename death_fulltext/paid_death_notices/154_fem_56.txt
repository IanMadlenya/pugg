        CUTILLO-Edith, 88, of Flushing, on November 6. Born in Manhattan, Ms. Cutillo was a graduate of Hunter College who joined the Red Cross as a social worker in 1944 and by 1947 was promoted to Casework Supervisor. After securing a Master's Degree in social work from Columbia University, she became Senior Intake Casework Supervisor in 1963. Meanwhile at home, she tended her aging parents with the aid of her sister Emily and, for several years, helped take care of her sister Lucille's three children, Thomas, Kathleen and Robert Murphy, and then became a surrogate mother to her sister Lena's three sons, John, Edward and Ronald Butscher. In 1966, disappointed and outraged by the glass ceiling in place at the Red Cross, she left the organization to take a position as Senior Social Worker at Elmhurst City Hospital, retiring from there in 1974. Edith Cutillo's adult life was dedicated to the health and happiness of others.
