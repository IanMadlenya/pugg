        VARNAY--Astrid. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of Astrid Varnay, whose interpretations of the leading soprano roles of Wagner and Richard Strauss are now legendary. She sang her first operatic performance anywhere as Sieglinde in ''Die Walkuere'' at the Met in 1941. From there she went on to mesmerize audiences here and abroad with her unique blend of dramatic intensity and powerful vocalism. Her 200 performances at the Met were spread over an initial 15 year period from 1941 to 1956, and five years from 1974 to 1979 when she returned to perform mezzo roles in the autumn of her long career. We offer our sincere condolences to her many friends and admirers and share their sadness. Peter Gelb, General Manager James Levine, Music Dir.
