        SOPHER-Morris. The entire Beth Israel Medical Center family mourns the passing of our dear friend and benefactor, Morris Sopher. He was a wonderful humanitarian who will be greatly missed. With his beloved wife Marilyn, they shared their concern for others facing a cancer diagnosis through their generous support of many programs and services and Beth Israel's Cancer Center. To Marilyn, the entire Sopher family and all of his loved ones, we offer our heartfelt condolences. Morton P. Hyman Chairman, Board of Trustees Matthew E.
