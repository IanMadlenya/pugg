        BERNSTEIN-Berta. We extend our heartfelt condolences to William Bernstein and Henny Brener, on the passing of their beloved wife and mother. As a Golden Founder of the Medical Center, together with her husband, she was a graceful, dignified and modest woman, who personified the highest standards of tzedakah and chesed. Berta served as an exemplary role model to her children, including her daughter, Henny, who directs Shaare Zedek's activities in Caracas, Venezuela. She is also a member of our International Board of Governors together with her husband, Rabbi Pynchas Brener. May William, children, Henny Brener, Dr. Celia Bernstein Waldman, Nathan Bernstein , Evelyn Gross, grandchildren and the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Amer. Comm. for Shaare Zedek Med. Ctr. in Jerusalem Erica Jesselson, Chair Menno Ratzker, Pres. Sidney Adler, Treas. Lee Weinbach, Pres. Nat'l Women's Div. Stuart Tauber, Exec. Dir.
