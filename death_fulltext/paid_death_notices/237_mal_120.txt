        STEIN--Howard M., died on October 10, of lung cancer, just short of his 91st birthday. A month before, he had been actively gardening and regularly driving 120 miles to the country. Son of Maurice Stein and Esther Zechnowitz Stein, Howard grew up in Brooklyn and attended Boys' High School. He graduated from the University of Michigan and was a lifelong fan of its athletic teams. After serving in the medical unit of the United States Army, where he was active in the European theatre of World War II, he entered his family's hat and accessories business and was its president for many years, later joining the family firm of HMS Productions. Many interests enriched Howard's life, and he enriched others with his participation. For years he and a group of friends enthusiastically made and bottled wine, but only Howard championed its taste enough to drink it. An avid reader, he supported three libraries and read aloud faithfully to his wife of 63 years, the former Anita Claire Alpern. In retirement he took up silversmithing, and produced beautiful tablewares and jewelry for friends and family. His various gardens were a joy, from the prized rhododendron he rooted from a cutting, to a quarter-acre of pumpkins, grown so his grandchildren could come to a pumpkin-picking party. Passionately in love with his wife Claire, this love illuminated his life, and dazzled everyone caught in its glow. In addition to his wife, he is survived by his son, M. Bradford Stein and daughter-in-law Mary Grace Pennisi Stein, by his daughter Wendy Alpern Stein and sonin-law Bart Friedman, by five grandchildren, Elizabeth Stein Ruark and her husband John Ruark, Zachary Stein and his wife Margaret Chang, Alexander Stein, Benjamin and Jacob Friedman and two great-grandchildren, Isabel Stein and Siena Ruark. A memorial will be held in November. In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to the Hillsdale Public Library, Hillsdale New York 12529.
