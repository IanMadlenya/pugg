        McKaY - Sr. Raymunde, RSHM. In mourning her passing and celebrating her life, we at Marymount Manhattan College join the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary in expressing tribute to Sr. Raymunde. As a former dean and president, Sr. Raymunde made an extraordinary contribution to our founding and our independence, to our survival and our success. Those who knew her well remember a committed and gifted leader. In her later years, she never failed to convey her interest in our students and faculty and her enthusiasm for the mission of the College to which she had devoted so much of her life. Anna Hayes Levin, Chair of the Board Judson R. Shaver, Ph.D., President Marymount Manhattan Coll.
