        STEVENSON-John. The Board of the American Theatre Wing celebrates the life of our esteemed member, John Stevenson. Along with his dedicated and loving wife Isabelle, John helped build the Wing to its prominent position of awarding excellence in the theater. We will miss his very wise counsel and friendship. Through his foresight and generosity, he created a fund to support the activities of the Wing, which the Board this year named in his honor. He will be forever missed.
        STEVENSON-John. We raise a final toast to our dear friend John, whom we will miss very much, and extend our deepest sympathies to Isabelle and the other members of his loving family. The Council of Four
        STEVENSON-John. We have all lost a very good and dear friend. Isabelle, we mourn with you. Leo Hausman and Virginia Sloane
