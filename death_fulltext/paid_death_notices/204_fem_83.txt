        GOLDSTEIN -- Helen. The Yeshiva University family is saddened by the passing of a deeply cherished Jewish communal leader, the wife of Rabbi Leonard Goldstein, and the proud mother of two sons from whose endeavors she derived much satisfaction. Heartfelt condolences are extended to Rabbi Goldstein, and Michael Fried and Arthur Fried, Chairman of the Board of the Avi Chai Foundation which has supported the Graduate Program for Women in Advanced Talmudic Studies at Stern College for Women, and the training of principals at the Azrieli Graduate School of Jewish Education and Administration. May the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel, President Norman Lamm, Chancellor Ronald P. Stanton, Chairman Board of Trustees
