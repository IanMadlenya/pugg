        TANNENBAUM-Sarah. Congregation Orach Chaim and Sisterhood record with profound sorrow the passing of our beloved member for more than half a century. A survivor of the Holocaust, a true ''Aiches Chayil,'' together with her husband they built a home of the highest ideals of Torah and Chesed. We extend heartfelt sympathy to her husband Joseph, her children Lisa (Dr. Jeffrey Glanz), Evelyn, and grandchildren. May they be consoled among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Michael D. Shmidman, Rabbi Wolf Scheck, President
