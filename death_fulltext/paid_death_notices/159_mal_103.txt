        DENBER-Herman C., M.D., Ph.D. The staff of the Zena and Michael A. Wiener Cardiovascular Institute of the Mount Sinai Medical Center mourn the passing of our friend and colleague, Herman C. Denber, M.D., Ph.D., Adjunct Professor of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Dr. Denber began his medical career following his graduation from the University of Geneva School of Medicine. His long relationship with Cardiology was through his interest in supporting young leaders in the field of clinical and investigative Cardiology. He established an endowment fund which awards the ''Denber Award for Excellence in Research in Cardiovascular Diseases''. His warmth, skills and wit were appreciated widely and will be missed deeply. Our profound condolences to his wife, Suzanne and his daughter Michelle. Valentin Fuster, M.D., Ph.D. Director, Cardiovascular Institute Mount Sinai School of Medicine
