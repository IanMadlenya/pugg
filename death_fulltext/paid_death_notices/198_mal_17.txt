        HOOPER--Thomas Edward. Award-winning photo journalist, interior and fashion photographer, commercial director and feature filmmaker who lived life fully and on his own terms. Consummate perfectionist who was a creative, dynamic and inspirational force to all he touched as well as a generous, loving and loyal friend to many. Rest in peace, Tom. As you often said, ''fear brings failure, faith brings success.'' We will miss you more than you'll ever know. Memorial Service Monday, July 7th, 5:30PM, Little Church Around the Corner, 1 E. 29 St., NYC. >>AD#
