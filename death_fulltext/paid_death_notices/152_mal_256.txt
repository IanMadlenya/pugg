        GARFUNKEL-J. Harold. The Officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of J. Harold Garfunkel, a cherished friend who was deeply devoted to the Jewish community. As a dedicated leader, he embraced the compassionate commitment of his father, who was a founder of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York, the predecessor to UJA-Federation. Following in his father's footsteps, he served as a life trustee of Federation, and was a longtime officer of Altro, one of our earliest beneficiary agencies. We extend our sincerest condolences to his daughter and son-in-law, Marjorie and Robert Bachrach; his daughter and son-in-law, Deborah and Robert Block; and his entire family. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair James S. Tisch, President Stephen D. Solender, Exec V.P.
