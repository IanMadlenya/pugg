        SKYDELL--A. Harry. Died May 11, 2006. Pater familias with a twinkle in his eye, Uncle Harry believed in keeping close his ever-growing extended family; and Aunt Rivie made it happen. His concern was genuine; he nurtured, and sometimes needled, as the occasion warranted. He reached out to family, friends and clients, who knew they could count on his concrete guidance, always dispensed with a generous supply of anecdotes. A Chaplain in the U.S. Army who participated in the Normandy Invasion, in WW II, he returned home to form an accounting firm, which he led for six decades. The prominence he earned in his profession was based both on his expertise and on his unwavering integrity. Many new young accountants, as well as clients, learned from his example. Within the community at large, numerous strangers benefitted from his anonymously-given aid. We shall miss Uncle Harry's open arms and incisive wit, and we will cherish always memories of wonderful times in the home-away-from-home he offered to us. May Aunt Rivie, his devoted wife, and his beloved chidren, Norman (Marilyn) & Barbara (Arthur) Safran, his grandchildren, great grandchildren and siblings be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
