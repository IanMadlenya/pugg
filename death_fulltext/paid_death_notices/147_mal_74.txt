        KATZ-Erich. The Cherry Lane Minyan deeply mourns the passing of Erich Katz and extend sincerest condolences to his wife, Elizabeth, and to the children Eleanore, Henry an Daniel, and the entire family. We will certainly miss his guiding advice and presence at Cherry Lane. May the family be comforted among the Mourners and Zion of Jerusalem.
