        DINKES--Estelle. The law offices of Dinkes & Schwitzer mourn the loss of our Senior Partner's mother. It is with great sadness that we learned of the passing of Mrs. Dinkes. Mrs. Dinkes was the widow of the founder of the law firm. As a result of her efforts and those of her late husband, Nathan Dinkes, many opportunities and goals have been reached by the employees of the company throughout the years. We send our heartfelt condolences to the entire family and only hope to aspire to the heights they have attained and we will always keep their legacy alive.
