        CLARK--Hays. The Board of Governors, Trustees, staff and members of Boys & Girls Clubs of America wish to express their profound sorrow over the passing of Mr. Hays Clark, our longtime Governor, friend, supporter and a true champion for children. Hays Clark was quite simply the greatest philanthropist in Boys & Girls Clubs of America's century-long history. He was a humanitarian without peer, a man of great vision and deep compassion. Hays expected nothing in return for his generosity, except results that would benefit the young people for whom he cared so deeply. Across four decades, Hays Clark had a profound impact on the Boys & Girls Club Movement, creating a powerful legacy that will last for generations. We are gratified that everyone who walks into our beautiful Hays & Ros Clark National Headquarters Building in Atlanta for many years to come will learn about Hays, a giant of a man whose like will not be seen again soon. A recipient of the Herbert Hoover Humanitarian Award from Boys & Girls Clubs of America for his passionate commitment to America's youth, Hays' contributions to our mission of service will never be forgotten. We will miss him greatly. Boys & Girls Clubs of America Anne Szostak, Chairman Roxanne Spillett, President
