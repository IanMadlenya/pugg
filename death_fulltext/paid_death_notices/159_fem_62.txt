        GELMAN-Gloria Gould. Born March 29th, 1922 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; reunited with her beloved husband, Milton S. Gelman on March 27, 2000. Gloria; wife, mother, sister and actress, was an exceptional woman whose strength, compassion and love will be with us forever. Her life may have dimmed, but never her spirit. She is survived by her daughter, Margaret Gelman and her sisters; Sally Lee Gould, Susan Gould Fredrichs, sister-in-law Edith Gelman, and many loved family members. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made to the American Cancer Society. Memorial services will be held at a later date at Mount Sinai Memorial Park, Los Angeles, CA.
