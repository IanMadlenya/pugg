        SCHIFF-Herbert. The Officers, Board of Directors and staff of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) mourn the passing of our friend and honorary Board Member, Herbert Schiff. For many years, Herb moved JDC forward as an organization through his careful decisions and decisive actions. Serving on JDC's Board of Directors and Executive Committee, he was single-handedly responsible for the establishment and initial financing of critical JDC infrastructure. Herb traveled the world several times over to review Jewish rescue and relief projects on a first hand basis. A studied individual who made decisions based on his own meticulous research, Herb's counsel and guidance were valued tools in enhancing the work of the JDC and in bettering the lives of hundreds of thousands of his fellow Jews. We extend our hearfelt condolences to his wife Betty, his three daughters Suzanne, Patricia and Jane, and the entire family. Eugene J. Ribakoff, President Jonathan W. Kolker Chairman of the Board Michael Schneider Executive Vice President
