        McINTOSH-Millicent Carey, on January 3, 2001. The trustees, administration, faculty, and staff of Bank Street College of Education note with sorrow the passing of Millicent C. McIntosh, a Life Trustee of the College. Mrs. McIntosh served as a Statutory Trustee on the Bank Street Board of Trustees from 1962 until 1974, when she was elected a Life Trustee in recognition of her tireless work and advocacy on behalf of the College, particularly during the period in which Bank Street was building its present campus on 112 Street. Mrs. McIntosh maintained her interest in and support for the College throughout her life. We acknowledge with gratitude our long standing debt to her and extend our condolences to her family. Augusta Kappner, President Elizabeth S. Pforzheimer, Chair
