        FAULKNER--Stanley. Beloved father, grandfather, uncle and brother died quietly on August 22 at the age of 96. His three children, two daughters-in-law, six grandchildren and sister survive him. On February 1, 1947 the Amsterdam News, commenting on the admission of Black persons to the Grand Jury said ''In Nassau county Stanley Faulkner lit the firecracker that made the Nassau County Grand Jury jump''. During his long and illustrious career he represented CIO Unions, witnesses called before the House Un-American Activities Committee and the McCarthy Senate Committee, civil rights workers in Mississippi, Viet Nam war resisters, victims of the coup in Chile and other civil rights causes. Stanley and Sylvia Faulkner lived their lives committed to working to better the conditions of others. Throughout his life, Stanley used his considerable professional skills in support of human rights. The impact of that commitment will survive him in the causes and persons he assisted and in his children and grandchilren. Donations in his name may be sent to The 92nd Street Y 60+ Group.
