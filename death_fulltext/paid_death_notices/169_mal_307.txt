        MOSCOVITZ-Howard, MD. The Jewish Home and Hospital medical department and entire staff mourn the loss of Howard Moscovitz, MD, Chief of Cardiology for more than 35 years. ''Howie'' was a friend to many, an outstanding surgeon and clinician who shared his positiveness with all.
        MOSCOVITZ-Howard, M.D. As his patient for over forty years, it is hard to imagine the future without him. He was very special as a friend and as a doctor. My thoughts are with his wife Ann and his children Harry, Ellen and Joan. Larry Nagle
