He is survived by his wife Shirley, his sons Ethan and Gabriel, his daughter-in-law Margee, his brother Paul and his cherished and devoted grandsons Eleazer and Julian. As a young man, he served his country as a navigator aboard a B-17 bomber in the Army Air Corps and the bond he formed with his crew was never broken. His generosity, wisdom, gentleness and love remain a blessing to his family and all who knew him.
