        LEWITTS - Estelle (Renick). Peacefully at home after a long illness on June 14, 1997. She was a devoted wife, loving and courageous mother and mother-in-law, doting grandmother and greatgrandmother. A pround upholder of Jewish tradition she also passed on to her offspring her commitment to community service, her love of tennis and golf, all leavened with a streak of mischievous humor and romantic idealism.
