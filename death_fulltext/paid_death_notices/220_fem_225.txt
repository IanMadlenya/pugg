        LARK--Cynthia Ann. Longtime biologist, passed away Tuesday, May 24, 2005. Born in Shawnee, OK, on New Year's Eve, 1928, to Lester Thompson, a petroleum engineer, and Eleanor Folz, she pursued a scientific career while raising a family of four children at a time when women in science had to choose between having a family or a career. After graduating from Mount Holyoke College, she met her future husband Karl G. Lark at Cold Spring Harbor, NY, where they were both involved in research. Thereafter, they collaborated frequently over a long and distinguished scientific career that took her from Washington University in St. Louis to Manhattan, Kansas, and ultimately to the University of Utah, in Salt Lake. Before retiring, she was a persistent researcher and teacher, traits she carried into retirement where she devoted her energies to developing an exotic garden full of plants she handpicked from all over the globe. At home, her teaching showed her children the how and why of scholasticism instead of just accepting easy answers. ''Look it up'' was a mantra: learn the tools and you never forget the answers or how to solve difficulties. She stimulated interest in literature by encouraging exploration of local libraries and ignoring those pesky age delimiters that promoted certain books and hid others from curious minds. As her children matured and pursued their own interests, she brought a number of uniquely individual dogs and cats into the home. They provided constant companionship and vitality, often traveling on trips to Colorado, along with her husband. In addition to her husband and four children (Clovis, Ellen, Susie, and Caroline), she is survived by a brother, David Thompson, of Florida. Funeral arrangements are private. An open memorial service is planned for late June or July. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Cynthia's name to Best Friends Animal Sanctuary, 5001 Angel Canyon Drive, Kanab, UT 84741.
