        WEINSTEIN--Arnold. The Columbia University Alumni Club of Westchester deeply mourns the untimely death of its beloved President and founder who led us with inspired leadership to become one of the premiere clubs in the Columbia Alumni network. Our deepest sympathy goes to his wife Elaine, his daughters Lisa and Leslie, Leslie's husband Richard Skriloff and Arnold's three cherished grandchildren Marc, Robbie and Alec. We will never forget him.
