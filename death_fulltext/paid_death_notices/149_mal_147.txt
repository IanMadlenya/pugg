        SEIDNER-David. The American Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR) mourns the loss of our talented and generous friend, a leading light in the world of art and fashion, and an outspoken advocate in the fight against AIDS. A world - renowned photographer, David was an early supporter of Art Against AIDS and donated numerous works to benefit amfAR. His moving portraits of famous people living with HIV/AIDS also helped build awareness and galvanize support for the Foundation's AIDS research programs. His creative energy and generosity of spirit will be sorely missed. Mathilde Krim, Ph.D. Founding Co-Chair and Chairman of the Board American Foundation for AIDS Research
