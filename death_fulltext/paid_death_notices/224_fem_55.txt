        RUSSEL--Myra Teicher. Died September 7th of a heart attack. She was two months shy of her 85th birthday. She is survived by her three children, Marjorie, David and Danny, their spouses, Peter, Luba and Keiko, six grandchildren to whom she was utterly devoted, Alexander, Byron, Constantine, Emily, Kevin and Sascha, and her brother Henry and sister-in-law Anne Teicher. Myra lived several lives, all with great intelligence and gusto. She was a lifelong socialist, a machinist during WW II, a loving wife and mother, a college professor, an author and scholar. After her children were grown, she earned an MA at Sarah Lawrence College, then taught literature at Elizabeth Seton College in Yonkers for many years. In retirement, she taught retired NY Public School teachers, selecting a fresh set of books to discuss each year. Her professional specialty was music written to the poems of James Joyce. In her 70's, she rediscovered and published a book of Geoffrey Molyneux Palmer's song settings to ''Chamber Music'', and she introduced the songs to musicians who performed and recorded them. Myra wrote many scholarly articles, and she attended and presented her work at various James Joyce symposia here and in Euorpe, most recently this past Bloomsday. She will be missed by her family and friends. Contributions in her name can be made to the International Rescue Committee. A memorial service will be held.
