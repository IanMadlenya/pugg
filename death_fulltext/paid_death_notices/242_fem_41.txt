        FLUHR--Ruthlynn, on February 27th, 2007. Her exemplary courage and love of life was manifested in the grace with which she engaged her relentless disease. Beloved sister, sister-in-law, aunt and great-aunt. An artist of unflagging passion, integrity and commitment to her work. A love of opera and ballet were loved second only to her painting and drawing. The 92nd Street Y's pool was long her oasis. At rest go gentle.
