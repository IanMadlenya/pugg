        LAWSON-Thomas. Dear, dear friend for over 40 years. The ''Doc'' as he was known to his inner circle of friends was my adopted brother. Thanks for all the fabulous times, the ups and the downs. We shared them all. Tommy was so much a part of our family. We will miss you more than you will ever know. Sincere condolences to his wife Fay, also my lifelong friend, and to his daughters Allysa and Stephanie, to his brothers Jon and Billy, to his mother Sally all I can say is we lost a real gem. We share your pain. Janie and Larry David Joan David
