        KANDLER-Simon, Hazzan Dr. The Cantors Assembly records with sorrow the passing of our oldest colleague and revered member of over five decades. A brilliant cantor with a magnificent voice, he quietly and gently served the spiritual needs of his temple Beth Emeth of Chestnut Hill, Mass., for almost 60 years with dignity, warmth and care. He was awarded an Honorary Degree by the JTSA in 1998. His kindness, his humanity and his caring inspired us all. We extend our sympathy to his family and loved ones. May his memory abide as a blessing. Hazzan Sheldon Levin, President Hazzan Stephen J. Stein, Exec. VP Hazzan Abraham B. Shapiro Executive Administrator
