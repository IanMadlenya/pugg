        WOLFERT -- Eleanor. Our condolences to the family of a dear colleague, Eleanor Wolfert, who generously gave of herself to make life better for those whose lives she touched. The City of New York, the Brooklyn community in particular, has lost a dedicated and tireless champion for justice. She leaves us with many fond memories having completed a job well done. With love to her family. The Rev. Carl E. Flemister Former Board Chair, NYC Health Systems Agency
