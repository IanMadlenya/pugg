        DICKERSON--Roy Hobbs, of Vinings, GA, died on February 28, 2007. He was born in Kansas City, MO, on April 8, 1924 and lived most of his life in Metropolitan NY. He leaves behind two daughters: Lynn Stuart of Memphis, TN and Ann Ogburn of Acworth, GA, and wife, Sue Hruby, of West Tisbury, MA. Also surviving Mr. Dickerson are four grandchildren, Katharine, Matt, Meredith and Vi, and former wife Kit Ravenel of Greensboro, NC. A private memorial service will be held by the family. The family requests donations (in honor of Roy) to the John Austin Cheley Foundation, 10565 Centennial Drive, Alpharetta, GA 30022-7078. Roy's passions included his international banking career at Citigroup, hiking, skiing, tennis and enjoying his family. Roy graduated from Yale in 1948 after serving in the Army as a Lieutenant during WWII where he served in the Pacific and with occupation forces in Japan. His subsequent career in international banking took him to every continent in the world, with country executive assignments first in London and later, Zurich. He was also proud of his role in the building the growing global corporate banking business, in particular financing Boeing during the development of the 747 and the Penn Central bankruptcy restructuring. He retired from Citigroup in 1986 after 32 years and refocused his passions on education. He was a passionate mentor to many young students in the NYC high school system as well as professional educators and businesspersons. Roy enjoyed spending time visiting with his grandchildren, and being with his wife on Martha's Vineyard. Roy was avidly interested in people and relationships. His never flagging optimism and encouragement even in the face of adversity will be of great inspiration to those he has left behind.
