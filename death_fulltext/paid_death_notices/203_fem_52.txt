        PINKETT--Mary. The City University of New York deeply mourns the death of former City Councilwoman, Mary Pinkett, a Brooklyn College Alumna, the first African-American woman elected to the New York City Council. She was an excellent and dedicated supporter of CUNY and educational oppotunity during her three decades of service in the Council. She will be sorely missed. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to her family. Benno C. Schmidt, Jr., Chairman Matthew Goldstein, Chancellor
