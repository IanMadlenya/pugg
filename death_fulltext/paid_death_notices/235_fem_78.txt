        HAYDEN--Melissa. We owe a debt of gratitude to the spirit, discipline, artistry and commitment of Millie. A convert and then a disciple of Mr. Balanchine, she endeavored to communicate a sense of artistic credibility to an art form that is often obscure. There was never an obstacle that she felt she could not overcome. Her courage with regard to art and its dissemination was and is, an inspiration. The memory of Millie will remain of pillar of inspiration to the art of all dance. The George Balanchine Trust Karin von Aroldingen Kay Mazzo Bellas Paul H.

        $(6$)HAYDEN--Melissa. The entire School of American Ballet family mourns the death of Melissa Hayden, one of America's greatest ballerinas. Her consummate artistry, her professionalism, her steely technique and hercolorful personality will long be remembered. We send deepest condolences to the Coleman & Damsky families.
        $(6$)HAYDEN--Melissa. You were an inspiration, a teacher and my friend. I was a voyeur to your love of ''performing,'' and I learned from you a respect for the energy spent on the stage and its relation to the public. You were a textbook of lessons to the novice. I will never forget you, and value your care and loyalty to me. Barbara Horgan
