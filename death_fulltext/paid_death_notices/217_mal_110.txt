        CASTELLI -- Victor. Peter Martins and the dancers, ballet masters, musicians, staff and Board of Directors of New York City Ballet deeply mourn the passing of former dancer and ballet master Victor Castelli, a much-beloved member of our family. As a soloist with the Company, Victor worked closely with both George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins, performing lead roles in such ballets as Mozartiana, Symphony in Three Movements, Dances at a Gathering and The Goldberg Variations, and as a ballet master he, in turn, took care of their works with the utmost integrity and dedication, developing an especially close association with Mr. Robbins and his repertory. During his 34 years with NYCB, Victor was cherished as a friend and colleague, and his grace, his spirit and his remarkable devotion to the Company will be greatly missed by us all. We send our sincerest condolences to his family, who meant so much to him. The family has asked that, in lieu of flowers, contributions be sent to the New York City Ballet Dancers' Emergency Fund, 20 Lincoln Center, NYC 10023.
