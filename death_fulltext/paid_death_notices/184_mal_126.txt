        DUNLAP-John, 46. Sales Executive for Penthouse Magazine and other general media publications, died May 10 at the Cabrini Medical Center after a long battle with AIDS and cancer. In addition to his position at Penthouse, John also tried his hand at various other ventures including selling high-end cosmetics out of the guest bathroom of his Manhattan apartment, giving massages in the dining room and experimenting with aromatherapy. Although he collected thousands of religious tomes, his favorite book appeared to be the PDR. In addition to his fondness for pharmaceuticals, he also fancied himself an expert in canine nutrition. He is survived by his sister Nina of Syracuse, NY, his brother Raymond of Atlanta, his aunt Lucy of Rochester, and dozens of friends from coast to coast who are convinced they will never meet another person quite like John. Funeral services at the Holy Protection of the Mother of God located at 2637 12th St., Astoria, Saturday, at 12 noon. Interment to follow in Baltimore on Tuesday at the Greek Orthodox Cemetery.
