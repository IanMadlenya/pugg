        KASSOW--Saul D. Gamma NYU Chapter of ZBT Fraternity, brothers of Saul D. Kassow mourn his death on April 9 at age 79. He served as President of the chapter alumni group for many years. Our condolences go to his devoted wife Angelia, their three daughters and his sister Judy. More than any other individual Saul was responsible for the survival of national college fraternity Zeta Beta Tau (established 1898) at a time when its existence was threatened by overwhelming financial pressures. He is missed.
