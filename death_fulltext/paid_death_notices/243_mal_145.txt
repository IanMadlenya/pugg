        BROWNE--Roscoe Lee. We mourn the loss of our longtime Trustee and faithful friend. He was always to be counted upon to be supportive of the aims and purposes of the Society. He filled our lives with the soft sound of poetry as only he could recite it. Now the stage is empty and the lights are low. Frank T. Crohn, President The Edna St. Vincent Millay Society
