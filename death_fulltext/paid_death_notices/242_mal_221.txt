        SLADE--Terry, Shareholders and previous residents of 465 West End Avenue have enjoyed Terry Slade's cheerful presence for over 60 years, but now are deeply saddened by his passing on March 20. We are indebted to him for his assistance in designing our lobby, and to his beloved wife, Joan, who died in 1990, for her part in establishing the co-op corporation as well as serving on the board for many years. Our sincerest condolences to his children and his family. The Board of Directors
