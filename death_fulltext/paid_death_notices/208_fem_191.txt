        PATTON -- Jolanda Aprea, died at home in North Bergen, New Jersey on May 22, 2004. Her sense of vitality, strength and her unique artistry carried her through a life of extraordinary events both joyful and difficult. Born in Naples, Italy in 1911 into a family of painters and musicians. Growing up in Italy through two World Wars and the Great Depression. To America after the war to wed the now late Lowell Russell Patton, Jr. for 49 years of marriage. Bearing children, Lowell Russell Patton III and Cleonice Niki Patton and becoming grandmother to Briana Perry Patton. Creating a home, telling a story, singing, acting, teaching voice or Italian, refinishing a piece of furniture, sewing, simply talking--she was always compelling. Those who knew her were deeply attracted and affected by her astonishing passion for life. Her life was her art. Ah, Jolanda, you were greatly loved and you will be sorely missed--and now you are going home. Services will be held in Naples, Italy. Make donations to Hospice or a preferred arts organization if wished.
