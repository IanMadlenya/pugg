        RITTS-Herb. We loved you from the moment we met you. Your soft spoken unassuming manner was equally as beautiful as your boundless creativity. During your brief 50 years, you lived a life others could merely dream of. Each person you captured, be it on film or in your heart, felt comfortable and adored. Your eyes filtered through the surface to winnow directly through to the core. This quality was one of your many mystical characteristics you so diligently cultivated. Thank you for loving Erik, as he did you...endlessly. Thank you for finding beauty in a world that at times, felt ugly. Thank you for documenting all the time we spent with you, Erik, and the children. We will surely miss the ''Ritts uniform''. We will never forget your all encompassing generosity. Lastly, you have left an indelible mark on our family....your family, to which we will always be grateful. We love you. Susann & Allan Hyman, Jeffrie & Jeffrey and the children.
