In good as well as not-so-good times, you could always count on Miss Anne. Whether celebrating a momentous occasion with the family or simply being available to listen & offer an honest opinion, she was always there for us. The Rosen family will truly miss Miss Anne & will cherish all of the memories of the time spent knowing her.
        BELFORD-Anne. The staff at Junior's Restaurant will miss working with Anne. For those of us who worked with Anne for many years, we will miss the comradery we shared, as well as her smiling face day after day. Miss Anne, as she was addressed by those who arrived after her, shared with us the history of Junior's. She was able to instill traditons of quality, service and integrity that make Junior's such a success. Working with Miss Anne was an experience that we will benefit from for the rest of our lives, and she will always remain in our hearts.
