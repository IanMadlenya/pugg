        VAN DALEN-Annaclare, Ph.D. It is with great sadness that the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services notes the death of Annaclare van Dalen, Ph.D., educational coordinator of JBFCS' Center for the Prevention of Family Violence, administrative supervisor of the agency's Pelham Office and director of trauma treatment for children's services. Dr. van Dalen was a woman of elegance and talent who combined her vast professional knowledge with her intuitive genius in the treatment of abused children, for which she was nationally recognized. She was also an outstanding clinician and researcher who brought to her work and all her endeavors enormous compassion, vitality and skills. Dr. van Dalen contributed her senior clinical abilities to numerous programs and was an architect of our services for traumatized clients. She will be sorely missed. We offer our condolences to Dr. van Dalen's family. Joseph S. Kaplan, President Seymour R. Askin, Jr., Chairman of the Board Alan B. Siskind, Ph.D., Executive Vice President Paul Levine, CSW, Associate Executive Vice President Robert Abramovitz, M.D., Chief Psychiatrist
