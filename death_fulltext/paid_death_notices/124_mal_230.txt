        SAIDENBERG-Daniel. The Juilliard School mourns the loss of Daniel Saidenberg. A distinguished alumnus of the School, he enjoyed an extraordinary career as a cello soloist and chamber musician, conductor and vibrant supporter of young artists. Through his generosity The Juilliard School and the general public have experienced a series of free faculty concerts for the past seven years. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife Eleanor, his sons Lawrence and Robert and all of his family. A memorial service will take place at Juilliard in the fall.
