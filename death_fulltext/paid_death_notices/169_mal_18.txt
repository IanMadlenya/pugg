        ZIMMERMANN-Rabbi Frank. We record with profound sadness the passing of our beloved colleague. He served several pulpits in the New York area, after which he became chair of the department and professor of Bible at Dropsie college in Philadelphia. He was the author of many books including ''The Aramaic Origin of the Four Gospels'', and translations of apocryphal works from the Aramaic. We express our deepest condolences to his wife, Betty, daughter, Judy Axelrod and to all who were touched through his rabbinate. Rabbi Vernon H. Kurtz, President Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Executive Vice President The Rabbinical Assembly
