        HEUMAN-Kenneth B. Our beloved Kenny, cherished by all who knew him. The very best father and adoring husband imaginable. His zest for living never waned. He was a hero in every sense of the word. How fortunate for us that he was our dear friend. Karen, Randi and Harvey, Cheryl, and Alexis we love you. Ellen and David Flatow and Family
