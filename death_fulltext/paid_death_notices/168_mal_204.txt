        HOGUE-William Marston. Longtime headmaster of The Tome School in North East, Maryland, died in Washington, DC, on January 13, 2001. Dr. Hogue was born in Washington, DC, on June 24, 1923, the son of William Henry and Irene Marston Hogue. He attended the George Washington University (B.A. and M.A.) and received the Ph.D. from the Catholic University of America.

In 1962 he was appointed headmaster of The Tome School in Port Deposit, Maryland, a post he held for seventeen years. During his tenure, the school, which had never recovered from the effects of the 1930's depression, was revitalized and relocated to a hundredacre campus adjoining the town of North East, Maryland. After relinquishing the headmastership in 1979, Dr. Hogue became executive director of The Jacob Tome Institute, the philanthropic foundation which owns and operates the school. He served as president of the Institute's board of trustees 1992-1994. He was recalled to be interim headmaster of the school 1989-1990. Dr. Hogue wrote a history of The Jacob Tome Institute and its schools, published in 1994 on the hundredth anniversary of the opening of the Institute's first school. His avocation was research in the field of American church history, and he published monographs in a number of scholarly journals. Dr. Hogue is survived by a brother, Walter Everett Hogue of Las Vegas, Nevada. Interment will be private.
