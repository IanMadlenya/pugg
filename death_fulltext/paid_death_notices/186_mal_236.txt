        MAURICE-David, Ph.D. July 20, 2002. We mourn the loss of an esteemed colleage, Dr. David Maurice, Professor of Ophthalmology and former Professor, Sanford University. David's love for visual sciences led to seminal contributions. He developed the confocal specular microscope, and was awarded the prestigious Friedenwald Medal at ARVO, among other honors. He was a founding editorial board member of Experimental Eye Research. We will miss his dry humor and innovative and creative intellectual power. Deepest sympathies to the family, Anna, Carlotta, Celia, Julia, Ruth and grandchildren. Stanley Chang, M.D., Chairman Edward Harkness Eye Institute Columbia University
