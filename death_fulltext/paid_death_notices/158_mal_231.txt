        KOWAL-John. The Residents, Staff and Board of Directors of the West Side Federation For Senior and Supportive Housing are so deeply saddened by the passing of John Kowal, a founder and our President for more than twenty years; our conscience and source of inspiration, immersed for decades in the struggle waged on behalf of all those searching for decent and affordable housing, in the struggle to save and provide housing for homeless and older persons, for those with special needs, for so many who live at the margins. His commitment and passion for justice never wavered. He has been the life affirming difference for thousands of New Yorkers who never knew him. They and we are forever changed by his life. We are dedicated to the mission he wrote for us by word and deed: to bring justice, dignity, care and love to all who need help. Our heartfelt sympathy to Debbie, Lisa, and Robert. Our profound gratitude for sharing your father so generously with us for these many years.
