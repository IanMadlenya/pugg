        WILDER-Jack, Dr. My beloved brother, farewell. Julie
        WILDER-Jack, M.D. The Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University mourns the passing of our professor emeritus, a distinguished psychiatrist, educator, and administrator who was associated with our medical school for close to 40 years, including 11 years of exemplary service as an Associate Dean. He was a creative, generous teacher and leader, whose legacy will live on through his many innovative contributions to the Einstein community. A renowned national leader in the movement for community-based mental health services, he played a leading role in establishing the first such program in New York City, at Einstein. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Therese, and the entire Wilder family. Dominick P. Purpura, M.D., Dean Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University
