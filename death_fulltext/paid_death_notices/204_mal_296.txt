        TODEL--Mortimer. Died January 20 in New York, the city he loved. Devoted husband, father, grandfather and brother. He was a social worker and an attorney for over 50 years, a Bronx Assistant D.A., and later, Executive Assistant to the US Attorney, Robert Morganthau. A humanitarian, always helping the community, he was a founder of a summer day camp for Bronx children, a founder of the Riverdale Y, and was president for many years of the Mental Health Association of New York City. He will be dearly missed.
