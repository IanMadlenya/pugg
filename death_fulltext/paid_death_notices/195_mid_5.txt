        FISHER-Anthony M. and Anne. On behalf of the Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art and the Committee on Painting and Sculpture, we extend our most profound sympathy to our dear friend Emily Fisher Landau and her family on the untimely passing of Tony and his wife Anne. A family passionately committed to the arts had been deeply diminished by this tragic accident, but the world has forever been enhanced by their lives. We all share their sadness and send our heartfelt condolences. David Rockefeller, Chairman Emeritus Agnes Gund, President Emerita Ronald S. Lauder, Chairman Robert B. Menschel, President Glenn D. Lowry, Director The Museum of Modern Art
