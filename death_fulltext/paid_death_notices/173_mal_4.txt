        KIAM-Victor K. Dear Victor, a heart of gold and charisma, a unique combination. My hero and beloved confidante and friend. You know you were my personal and professional role model and mentor. An uncanny ability to make everyone around you feel incredibly special. You gave to all without expecting anything in return. Victor, you and Ellen have built a family that will always be my foundation. Thank you for including me in your family and heart. I will always cherish our time spent together, and your inner strength and beauty will always serve as my guide. I will love and support your family forever, and you can rest assured that they will continue to ''go for it'' in life and in tennis! Love always, Jay B. Horowitz
        KIAM-Victor. We loved Victor Kiam and his enthusiasm for life. We remember, especially, hosting Victor and Tory in Cincinnati for the Father-Son Tennis Championships, dinners with him at Harvard College, nights at the U.S. Open, and eating a lot of strawberry pancakes. Victor embraced life and sparked others to live more fully. We were blessed to share some time with this big-spirited and kind-hearted man. Jim and Peggy Bridgeland John and Maureen Bridgeland
