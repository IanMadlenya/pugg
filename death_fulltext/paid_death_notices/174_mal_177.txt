        UBALDI-Jack. The many students, customers, readers and friends of Jack Ubaldi mourn his death on Saturday, July 14, at the age of 90. He loved people, food, and cooking, and whether in his store, the Florence Meat Market on Cornelia Street in Greenwich Village, or in his classrooms at the New School, The New York Restaturant School, and Peter Kump's Cooking Schol, he endeared himself to all who came in touch with him. His many students remember that every class ended with a meal, usually with a glass of wine, and always with a sense of warm fellowship. He was a true New Yorker, born in Italy, but loving this city, and he spent his working life and an active retirement as a vital part of it. Elizabeth Crossman Carol Durst
