        O'MALLEY-Marcella Butler. On January 18, after a courageous struggle with multiple myeloma. Beloved wife of James for 55 years, daughter of the late Thomas and Margaret, mother of Malcolm and Anne, sister of the late Reynolds Butler and Catherine Butler. Born in Montreal in 1915. Her strength, graciousness, beauty and determination were admired by many. She cared deeply about her community and creative efforts, to which she contributed her paintings. Her inimitable presence and loving spirit will be missed enormously. Friends will be received at Frank E. Campbell, Madison Ave. at 81 Street, on January 20, from 7 to 9 PM.
