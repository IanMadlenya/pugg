        EPSTEIN-Ruth. Yeshiva University & its Stern College for Women are saddened by the passing of a dear friend, a highly respected leader of the Jewish community who was a member of the SCW Board of Directors for over a decade. Beloved wife of the late Jacob Epstein, she was a YU Guardian and established the Ruth Epstein Scholarship Fund at Stern College. The Stern Board honored her at its inaugural dinner in 1988 for her dedication to the advancement of Jewish education-a legacy she has passed to her four children, all YU alumni. We extend our heartfelt condolences to children, Martin (and Gloria) Epstein, Gilbert (and Marion) Epstein, Stewart (and Judith) Epstein, and Gloria (and Laurence) Gordon; grandchildren; and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University David S. Gottesman, Chairman Board of Trustees Marjorie Diener Blenden, Chairman,SCW Board of Directors
