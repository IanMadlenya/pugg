        VOGEL--Frederic B. The Board of Trustees and staff of Theatre Development Fund mourn the loss of our colleague, Frederic B. Vogel. Fred's passion for the theatre was embodied in his commitment to identifying and training emerging producers through the Commercial Theater Institute, as well as by his earlier work, providing technical assistance to notfor-profit theatres throughout the country. He was tireless in his work and will be sorely missed. David D. Holbrook, Chairman Victoria Bailey, Exec. Dir.
