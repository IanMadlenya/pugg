        DUTTON-Aubrey Whiteley, age 86, of Brooklyn, NY, on January 25, 1997, in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Born on August 23, 1910 to Lawrence Amor Dutton and Eunice Holt (Whiteley) Dutton at Twin Oaks, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, on a farm owned by the Dutton famly since 1682. Resident of the Flatbush section of Brooklyn since 1916. Graduate of P.S. 99, James Madison High School and Pratt Institute, Class of 1932. Artist and cartoonist whose work appeared in The Saturday Evening Post, Colliers Magazine and other national publications and whose paintings hang in homes and offices all along the Eastern Seaboard, but his greatest role in this life was as the totally devoted and loving husband of fifty-two years of his wife, Ruth M. Dutton (nee Andorfer) and as the extraordinarily caring and nurturing father and best friend of his son, Richard L. Dutton, of West Orange, New Jersey, and his daughter, Barbara L. Dutton, of Allentown, Pennsylvania, by whom he will be greatly missed. He was also loyal and unselfish in his concern for his other relatives and his many longtime friends. Funeral arrangements handled by Horace Schantz Funeral Home, Emmaus, PA; memorial service at later date to be announced. Contributions in his memory to Kings Highway United Methodist Church, Brooklyn, New York, would be greatly appreciated.
