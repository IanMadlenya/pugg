        BOEHM-Herman. After a long illness, our beloved Herman, 92, ''The Judge,'' died peacefully at home in NYC on June 9, 2002. The ultimate gentleman, he treated everyone with kindness, intelligence, and tact. His generosity of spirit, as well as of his resources, was boundless (CR&T, Habonim Preschool, Baeck Institute, Young Artists of Israel, and The Museum of Jewish Heritage, etc.). The son of Else and Max Bohm of Berlin, Germany, he came to the U.S. at the start of WWII, married Antoinette Praschkauer (deceased) and served in the U.S. Army Intelligence Corps. After the war, he achieved great success in the food import business. A masterly bridge player, award-winning ballroom dancer, raconteur, lifelong horse lover and opera lover, he was a joy to be with. He is survived by and deeply mourned by his wife Anna KarchmarBoehm; a sister, Hilda Oliven; a nephew, Herbert David; a niece, Eleanor Rosenthal; his great-grandnephew Daniel Rosenthal and Emmy Kondo; his great-grandniece Susan Rosenthal and Brett. Also mourned by his stepson Robert Karchmar and Yosefa Klein-Karchmar; Sylvia Karchmar, Dorian and Lara Karchmar, and his extended family. Irena Starzec, Maia Matcharashvili & Joanna Sobyczak, who so enhanced the quality of his last years, join the family in mourning. Darling Herman, we will always remember your wisdom, thoughtfulness, and engaging smile. Your family and friends will miss you so very much. Memorial service to be announced.
