        KOZIEL--John. It is with deep sorrow that friends and colleagues at The New York Times acknowledge the passing of John Koziel on April 28 in Florida. John will be remembered as an avid golfer, a quick wit, and an eager worker. He was a dedicated employee of The Times for 34 years before retiring in 2001 and was devoted to his wife of 38 years, Pat. Of the various positions John held at The New York Times, he was proudest of the role that he played as the manager of the Chicago advertising office from 1982 to 1992. During his tenure at The Times, he also worked with the major movie studios, book publishers, and the recruitment industry. He is survived by his wife Pat and a brother Kenneth of New Jersey. A memorial service will be held on Friday, May 6, 2005 at Our Lady of Czestochowa, 120 Sussex Street in Jersey City, NJ at 10AM. Mass at 11AM. Lunch to follow. Contributions in his memory may be sent to The Villagers for Hospice, P.O. Box 280, Lady Lake, Fl 32159.
