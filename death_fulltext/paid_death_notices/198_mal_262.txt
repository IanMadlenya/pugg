        FULD--Stanley H. Yeshiva University and its Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law (CSL), mourn the passing of the Honorable Stanley H. Fuld, a founding director and Fellow of Cardozo and honorary board member. A respected jurist and civil rights advocate, Judge Fuld served on New York State's highest court for 27 years and as Chief Judge of the New York State Court of Appeals for six years. Renowned for his legal acuity and his fervent support of defendants' rights, his decisions often broke legal ground. Our heartfelt condolences to his wife Stella, children, Judith Miller, Hermine Nessen, Myron Rapaport and Robert Rapaport, six grandchildren and seven great - grandchildren. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel, President Dr. Norman Lamm, Chancellor Ronald P. Stanton, Chairman Board of Trustees Earle I.
