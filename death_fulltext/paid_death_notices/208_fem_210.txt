        URBAN--Sarah (Sally) on May 26, 2004. Beloved daughter of the late Ida and Louis Bursky. Cherished wife of Martin Urban, of blessed memory. Loving mother of Goldy and Arthur Fried and Lois and Gerald Kirsh. Cherished grandmother of Lisa and Michael Greenberg, Steven and Robin Fried and Roy Israel Kirsh. Adoring great-grandmother of Martin, Abagail, Gillian, Max and Nicole. Sister of the late Rose Bursky. We will miss her sharp intellect, keen humor and spunk. We celebrate her long life and pray that she rest in peace.
