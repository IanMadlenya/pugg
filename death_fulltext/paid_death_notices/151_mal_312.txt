        CASTELLI-Leo. The American Foundation for AIDS research (amfAR) mourns the passing of Leo Castelli, a driving force in the creation of Art Against AIDS, a decade-long project that raised vital funds for AIDS research. Castelli generously donated his time, energy and expertise to galvanize the support of countless artists, collectors, dealers and major art institutions in the fight against AIDS. The success of Art Against AIDS was due in large part to Leo Castelli's efforts, and his vision and generosity of spirit will be sorely missed. Mathilde Krim, Ph.D. Founding Co-Chair and Chairman of the Board, American Foundation for AIDS Research
