        GLEYSTEEN-William H., Jr. The Officers, Directors and Staff of Japan Society mourn the passing of William H. Gleysteen, Jr., President of the Society from 1989-1995. One of America's leading experts on east Asia, Ambassador Gleysteen had a distinguished 30 year diplomatic career in the State Department including service in Japan and Taiwan and as Ambassador to South Korea. He led Japan Society through a period of growth in programs, endowment, and the expansion of its headquarters building. His keen intellect and wise counsel were an inspiration to all who had the pleasure of working with him and he will be greatly missed. We extend deep condolences to his wife Marilyn and the family.
