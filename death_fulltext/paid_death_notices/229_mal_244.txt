        BRODSKY--Irvin. American Friends of The Hebrew University mourn the passing of Irvin Brodsky, an AFHU national board member and Hebrew University Benefactor. Along with his wife, Charlotte, Irvin was devoted to the State of Israel and to the cause of higher education. His generous acts of philanthropy provided academic resources for the University, as well as vital scholarship support for deserving students. We extend our deepest sympathies to his entire family.
