        BERG--Sr. Majella, RSHM. The Board of Trustees, the President, the faculty and administration of Marymount Manhattan College join our sister institution Marymount University of Arlington, VA in mourning the passing on April 5, 2004 of Sr. Magella Berg of the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary. Sr. Magella served as the first registrar of Marymount Manhattan College before becoming the President of Marymount in Arlington, where she served for 33 years. Under her visionary leadership, that college went from being a two year college to a University with outstanding programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels. She will be greatly missed. Anna Hayes Levin, Chair of the Board Judson R. Shaver, Ph.D President Marymount Manhattan Coll.
