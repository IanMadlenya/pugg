        WEISS--Ruth. Age 70. Loving mother of Ken Weiss. Caring sister of Ron Derin. Proud grandmother of Roy and Gil. A pillar of strength with a quick wit to boot, she lived her life for her family, especially her pride and joys, ''the boys'', including Steven, who predeceased her at the tender age of 26. Beautiful memories will live on eternally.
