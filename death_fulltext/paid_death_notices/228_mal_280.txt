        COUPER--Richard W. The New York Public Library deeply mourns the passing of its President Emeritus and senior statesman, Richard W. Couper. The first full-time President and chief executive officer of the Library, Mr. Couper provided outstanding leadership during his tenure, from 1971 to 1980. He not only steered the Library through New York City's difficult fiscal crisis, but also oversaw many important achievements: computerizing the Library's catalog, collaborating with major university libraries to form The Research Libraries Group, balancing the Library's budget for the first time since 1924, and increasing financial support, raising the number of private donors by more than tenfold. He was especially dedicated to his colleagues, and he and his wife generously established an endowment to provide scholarships to further the education of Library staff members. We are grateful for all of the time and great talent that he devoted to the Library, which, in turn, benefited so much. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Patsy, and to all the members of the family. Mrs. Vincent Astor, Honorary Chairman Catherine C. Marron, Chairman Samuel C. Butler, Elizabeth Rohatyn, Marshall Rose, Chairman Emeriti Paul LeClerc, President
