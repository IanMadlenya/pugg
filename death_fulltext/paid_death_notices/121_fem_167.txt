        NEWHOUSE-Bertha S. Died on January 23 in New York City at the age of 78. Beloved wife of Roy for over 53 years. Loving mother of Martin and Lina Wood. Devoted grandmother of Katherine, Philip, Samuel, Emma and Rebecca. Born in Mt. Vernon, New York, she lived most of her life in New York City, where she was educated and where her children were raised. She graduated from Morris High School in the Bronx, received her B.A. from Hunter College and an MS from the School of Business, Columbia University. In addition to caring for her family, she was the first woman accountant to do field work for the firm of S.D. Leidesdorf Co. and the first woman CPA in the department of Accountancy at Baruch College, CUNY, where she taught for many years and, at her retirement, was Associate Dean and Professor of Accountancy in the School of Business and Public Administration. As an officer of the Gustave Hartman YM/YWHA in Far Rockaway, she helped formulate an ongoing drug abuse discussion program. She was also founder and president of the Atlantic Shore Section of the National Council of Jewish Women, setting up the first recreation center for senior citizens in the area. In 1984, she was named as a distinguished alumna to the Hunter College Hall of Fame by the Alumni Association of Hunter College. A voracious reader, a devotee of The New York Times cross word puzzle, a woman of inspired conversation, a deeply caring friend, and a person who never lost her passionate love for the cultural life of this city, her death leaves a void that can never be filled. Funeral services will be at 10:45 a.m. on Sunday, January 26 at The Riverside Memorial Chapel, 76th St. and Amsterdam Ave., followed by burial at Mt. Ararat Cemetery in Farmingdale, New York. Thereafter, her family will be at 140 Nassau Street, N.Y.
