        FRISS--Dan. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) mourn the loss of Dan Friss of Long Boat Key, Florida. A great and munificent friend of the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, he worked tirelessly to enhance and expand our Sarasota/ Gulf Coast Chapter. He supported Israel and the Technion at the highest level of giving, becoming a Technion Guardian with his nephew, Milton Richter. Generous but modest, his gifts of time, energy and invaluable ideas were given behind the scenes. We extend our sincere condolences to Milton Richter and the entire Friss family. American Society for Technion-Israel Institute of Technology Stephen A. Laser, President Evelyn Berger, Chairman, Board of Directors Melvyn H. Bloom, Executive Vice President Gary G. Folz, President, Sarasota/Gulf Coast Chapter Betty Lustig, Director and Stephanie Nagus, Assistant Director, Southern Region
