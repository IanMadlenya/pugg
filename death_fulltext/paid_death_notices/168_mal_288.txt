        LEVINE-David. It is with great sorrow that the Officers and Employees of Saatchi & Saatchi mourn the death of a cherished friend and respected colleague. A brilliant star has been dimmed. We will remember David for his warm smile, hardy laugh and professional excellence. David was most recently Executive Vice President, International Creative Director in the company's Paris office. Before he moved to Paris two years age, David was the Creative Director on Tide, Cascade, Ivory, Spic & Span and Cinch. He joined us after he had received an impressive share of awards for his work on businesses that included Coca-Cola, American Express, Burger King and Maxwell House Coffee. Through his work, David touched the lives of many, even those that did not know him personally. David, you are already missed. We extend our deepest sympathy to David's entire family: Wife Pamela Buckner-Levine, children Noah and Emma, mother Sarah, brother Kenneth and Mother-in-Law Millicent Buckner. Memorial services will be on Monday, January 22 at 11:45 A.M. at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made to the American Cancer Society.
