        KRAMER--Saul. On behalf of the Board of Directors, staff, volunteers, friends and supporters of MorseLife and the Marilyn & Stanley M. Katz Seniors Campus and the Jewish Federation of Palm Beach County, we mourn the passing of our esteemed benefactor, colleague and friend Saul Kramer. Mr. Kramer was honorary vice-president of the Morse Geriatric Center Board of Directors, a member of the Board of Directors for the MorseLife Men's Associates and is the namesake of the Lola & Saul Kramer Senior Services Agency which has served generations of seniors throughout Palm Beach County. He was also a member of the Board of Directors of the Jewish Federation of Palm Beach County, whose building bears his and his late wife's name. He will be sorely missed. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his entire family. Arthur S. Loring MorseLife, Inc. Chairman Arlene Kaufman Jewish Federation of Palm Beach County President
