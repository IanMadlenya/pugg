        KURTZ--Norman. We mourn the passing of our dearest friend of 30 years. He enriched our lives with his brand of wisdom, balance and humor. As families and friends we were a team completely entwined and cherished the memories of bringing up our children, gardening, tennis, skiing, golf, celebrations and joyfully laughing together. Our hearts, love and support go out to Honey, Lori, Stephanie, Barry and Judy. Judy, Joel, Dana and Ross Bauer
