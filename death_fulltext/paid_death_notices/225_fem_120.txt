        REAVIS--Thetis Touliatou, of New York and Stonington, CT, unexpectedly on October 14, 2005. Adoring of and adored by her daughter and son-in-law, Helen D. (''Heidi'') Reavis, and Steven Engel, and loving of and loved by her sister and brother-in-law, Diana and Roy Vagelos, her nieces and nephews, Ellen Masseur, Andrew Vagelos, Cynthia Roberts, Randall Vagelos and their families, her niece and nephews, Cate Reavis, David Reavis, Jamie Reavis and their families, as well as the Andris family, the Copsinis family, the Eitel family, the Engel family, the Harocopos family, the Touliatos family, and numerous other close relatives, friends and colleagues. A graduate of Smith College (Phi Beta Kappa) and The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, Thetis spent her career in foreign policy and education and for 24 years worked at The Foreign Policy Association, most recently as its Vice President, Public Affairs. She was actively involved with many organizations including The Women's City Club of New York, UNIFEM (United Nations Development Fund for Women) and The Smith College Club of New York City. Thetis is already sorely missed. No one who knew Thetis was left untouched by her generosity, love, friendship, kindness and intelligence. A family service will be held in Stonington, Connecticut. A memorial service to honor Thetis will be held in NYC later this year. At that time, the family will communicate with respect to contributions in lieu of flowers.
