        EDELMAN-Albert I. Our family mourns, with my sisterin-law Eleanor Edelman and her children Gwen, Thomas, Jennifer and Cornelia, and grandchildren Elizabeth and Eleanor, the loss of my dear brother Albie. A star has fallen but it will live forever in our minds' eyes as we recall his quick response and steady and wise hand in any family crisis and life-long contributions in the legal profession, to his country and to scientific and educational institutions. His great intelligence, high spirits, good cheer and wit and his brilliant and humorous verses composed for many occasions will never be forgotten. A memorial service will be held at 11AM Monday, January 13th, Temple Emanu - El, 65th Street and 5th Avenue. Contributions may be made to the RU Council of Rockefeller University.
