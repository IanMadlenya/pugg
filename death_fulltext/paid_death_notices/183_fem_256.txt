        HENDERSON-Sally Lou. Beloved wife of Thomas Bradford. Her gregarious warmth and diverse interests enriched us all. Through her design firm, Henderson & Assoc., Sally created wonderful living environments, making friends with a diverse cross-section of New Yorkers as she worked. She also taught environmentally responsible (''green'') design to graduate students at New York School of Interior Design and worked tirelessly on projects such as Earth Day New York. Besides her husband, she is survived by her father, Dr. John W. Henderson, Chair Emeritus of the Dept. of Ophthalmology at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, her sister, Holly, also of Rochester, and her uncle, Glenn Henderson of Palm Springs, CA. A memorial service will be held Wednesday, May 1 at 10 A.M. at Unitarian Church of All Souls, 80th and Lexington Ave. in New York. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to NYSID-Sally Henderson Green Design Lecture Fund, C/O New York School of Interior Design, 170 E. 70th St., NY, NY 10021-5110.
