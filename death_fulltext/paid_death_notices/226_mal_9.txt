        WEISL--Edwin L., Jr. The Robert Lehman Foundation, its Directors and Associates, and the staff of the Robert Lehman Collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, mourn the death of our beloved colleague. Eddie brought to life a multifaceted, informed enthusiasm that was the wonder and envy of us all, along with a great courage in the face of an implacable illness. He was trained as a lawyer, but it was in the study of Late Medieval and Early Renaissance Italian painting that he found his joy and vocation, both as a scholar and connoisseur in his own right, and as a patron of a number of notable scholarly efforts in the field. It is perhaps our greatest sorrow that Eddie did not live to see the great Fra Angelico exhibition now in the Lehman Wing at the Metropolitan Museum, a show that would have excited his every instinct as scholarconnoisseur, although he was at least able to see and discuss the catalogue. Our condolences go out to his family and friends, most especially his daughter-and our colleague--Angela. We won't ever forget him. Philip H. Isles, President, Robert Lehman Foundation Laurence Kanter, Curator, Robert Lehman Collection, Metropolitan Museum of Art
