        YOUNGMAN-Henny. The Officers, Governors and Members of the New York Friars Club deeply mourn the loss of their beloved Friar and Friend, Henny Youngman. Henny brought the gift of laughter into the Friars Monastery daily through his quips, one-liners and unique take on the world around him. We are honored and proud to have played such a large part in the larger-than-life world of this endearing comic. He was an entertainer who made a nation laugh and today we take pause, in our sadness, to laugh at the memory of hearing those infamous words, ''Take my wife, please.'' Alan King, Abbot Freddie Roman, Dean Jack L. Green, Dean Emeritus Jean Pierre Trebot, Executive Director
