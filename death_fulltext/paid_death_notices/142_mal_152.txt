        WEISS-Robert was born in Jersey City, New Jersey, and was a 1982 graduate of Teaneck H.S. He began his undergraduate degree at University of Southern California and graduated from the NYU Tisch School of the Arts. He received a masters degree from the American Film Institute in screenwriting. He later graduated from Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, and became a member of the California Bar. Robert was a board member at the Huntington Beach Art Center, Huntington Beach, California, and was an avid collector of contemporary art. Robert was more than simply an art collector; over the past few years he became an important supporter of many emerging and established Los Angeles artists. Given the chance, he would certainly have become one of the major figures of the west coast contemporary art scene. Robert was the Vice President and Director of Legal Affairs for the Anaheim Indoor Marketplace. Robert is survived by his parents Lois and Barry Weiss of Tenafly, New Jersey, his sister Janet Dwork of Jupiter, Florida, and his brother-inlaw Dr. Thom Dwork, and his nephews Teddy and Alex. Also surviving are loving grandparents Aaron Rothenberg of Bal Harbour, Florida, and Murray and Eadie Weiss of Malden, Mass., his uncles and aunts Jack and Carol Weiss of Teaneck, New Jersey, Ken and Anita Altman of Plainview, New York, Dr. Ken and Gillian Rothenberg of Tenafly, New Jersey, and Drs. Andrew and Trisha Roth of Beverly Hills, California. Barry and Lois are the owners of Sylvette Shops in Hudson County New Jersey.
