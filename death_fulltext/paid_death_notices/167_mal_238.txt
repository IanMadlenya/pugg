        D'INZILLO-Steve. We the family, the siblings, of Steve D'Inzillo, mourn the loss of our beloved brother. His sensitivity, caring and love for us have been an abiding source of pride and example. Those same sentiments he dedicated to the larger world of work and country. He entered the work world early, interesting himself in the needs and problems of working people, knowing the necessity and broad social benefit of better working conditions for them and for the country. For the good of the country and the justness of the cause, he joined the Army during World War II, at the age of 37, contributing to the freedom effort as a skilled glider pilot. Upon discharge, he returned both to the movie industry and the union movement that he loved so much. With his protean energy and unique determination, he achieved much in the struggle for dignified wages and working conditions for all workers including women, minorities and the foreign born. In April of 2000, at age 90, he retired as president of local 306 of the International Alliance of Theatrical and State Employees and Moving Picture Machine Operators of the United States and Canada (IATSE). For many years, his siblings, friends and union associates have enjoyed his gentle friendship, his great courage, and his extraordinary vision and dedication. He is remembered well and well will he be missed. Steve D Inzillo. July 17, 1910 -October 13, 2000.
