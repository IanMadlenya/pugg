        BERGMAN-Bernard B. The partners and staff of George R. Funaro & Company P.C. mourn the passing of their former partner and colleague, Bernard B. Bergman. His guidance and wisdom during the past fifty years will long be remembered. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife Doris and daughters, Denise and Jacqueline and their entire families.
