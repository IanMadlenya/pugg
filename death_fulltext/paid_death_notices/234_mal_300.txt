        RUDIN--Fred, 88, beloved husband of Alice, whose marriage for 54 years was a true love affair. Father of Rebecca, Robert & Mitchell, grandfather of Lily, Paul, Jake, Miles, Greg, Ben and Scott, and father-in-law to Alissa, Bonnie and Rob. Born in NYC, Freddy was a WW II veteran who served five years mostly in the Pacific. He returned to NYC to found Rudin & Roth, a leading hosiery manufacturer. A civic leader, he was a longtime trustee and deputy mayor of Atlantic Beach. He was a passionate fisherman, who held several records, photographer and traveler, and also a collector of art and books, but nothing was more important than his love of family who all miss Freddy dearly. Services will be at Riverside Memorial, 76th St and Amsterdam Ave at 11:45 AM on Thursday, July 27th.
