        HERZ-John W. Kohnstamm, Inc. mourns the loss of John W. Herz, a resident of Larchmont, NY, who died on October 19. He was a senior partner of the law firm Wolf, Haldenstein, Adler, Freeman and Herz, and counsel to this company. He was a valuable Director and with his predecessor Herbert Haldenstein, established the company pension program. He will be missed by our company which was established in 1851, and was served by the Wolf Haldenstein firm for over 80 years. We extend our sympathies to his wife, Elise, and to their three sons.
