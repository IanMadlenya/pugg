        McCALL-David. Board members, officers, and friends of the Humpty Dumpty Institute mourn the loss of their friend and colleague, Mr. David McCall and his wife Penny. His deep commitment to humanitarian causes will be remembered by all who accompanied him on our trip to Africa last year to establish a new program to remove landmines in Africa and to return land to productive use. Our deepest sympathy to his family at this terrible time of loss. Michael W. Sonnenfeldt, Co-Chair William J. Rouhana, Jr., Co-Chair Constance J. Milstein, Vice Chair
