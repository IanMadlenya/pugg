        RINGLER--Isidore. The Heschel School community mourns the loss of Isidore ''Izzy'' Ringler, beloved husband of Miriam, adored father of Rachel Ringler and father-inlaw of Yossi Siegel. Esteemed grandfather of Alana '97, Sam '01 and Talia, a current student. Izzy was devoted to his family and left a legacy of love among the generations that were fortunate enough to share in his life. Rachel continues in her father's model by making her family the focus of her life. Rachel and Yossi are leaders in our school, giving so much of their talent, time and resources. May the entire Ringler-Siegel family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusaleum. Alisa R. Doctoroff, President Roanna Shorofsky Head of School
