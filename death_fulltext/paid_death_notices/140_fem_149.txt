        DONNELLON-Mary. The staff of the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) mourns with deep sadness the passing of our colleague Mary Donnellon at much too young an age. For 15 years, Mary had been a mainstay of NRDC bringing her great energy, passion, abilities, and forceful personality to its environmental mission and its institutional health. Mary was a person who made things happen; she had a telling impact on NRDC's people and programs and was a doughty fighter in many vital environmental battles. She faced her own arduous and draining battle against cancer with courage and without complaint-maintaining her scrappiness, her sense of humor and her love of life. Despite the many setbacks she faced throughout her struggle against disease, Mary was always fully engaged with life. She will be deeply missed by all of us who were priviledged to work with her at NRDC on behalf of the environment. We extend our heartfelt condolences to her husgand, Bill McGuire, her stepdaughters, her parents, her siblings and her nieces and nephews.
