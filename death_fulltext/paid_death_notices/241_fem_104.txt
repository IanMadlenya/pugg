        BOSNIAK--Dr. Stephen. The officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn with profound sadness the loss of Dr. Stephen Bosniak, beloved fiance of Beth Rudin DeWoody.

Through their inspiring leadership, they have strengthened UJA-Federation's ability to care for those in need in New York, in Israel, and around the world. We extend our deepest sympathies to Beth, to her children, to the Bosniak family, and to all who knew and loved Stephen. Morris W. Offit, President Susan K. Stern, Chair of the Board John S.
