        SHEETS--Niki Singer, of Manhattan. The beautiful, smart, charming, graceful, elegant, strong, loving wife of Michael Sheets, wonderful mother of Romaine and Nicholas Sheets, devoted step-mother of Alexandra Sheets Saikley and Hilarie M. Sheets, and deeply caring sister of Donna Lawrence and Richard Sarachan, lost her battle with breast cancer on February 1 after a courageous fight. Happy memories of her spirit, style, optimism, cheerfulness and love of food, wine, music and life will be with us always. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to The Lance Armstrong Foundation.
