        DRIESMAN-Miriam. The National Board of Hadassah, WZOA, sadly mourns the death of Miriam Driesman, our beloved colleague. Miriam, along with her late husband Alfred, was a cherished supporter of the Hadassah College of Technology and the Hadassah Medical Organization. Among their many generous contributions were the medical library at Mt. Scopus and Yag Laser at Ein Kerem. Miriam was a shining example of selfless leadership and dedication, serving as a respected mentor to future generations of Hadassah leaders. She served with distinction as a National Vice President and a member of the Honorary Council. Our heartfelt condolences are extended to the entire family. May her memory be for a blessing. Bonnie Lipton, National President Dr. Laura S. Schor, National Executive Director
