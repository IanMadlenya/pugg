        HENDERSON - Skitch. The House of Steinway & Sons notes with profound sorrow the passing of its beloved friend, the renowned pianist and conductor Skitch Henderson, on November 1, 2005 in New Milford, Connecticut at the age of 87. Mr. Henderson was a deeply valued member of our Steinway Artist family for nearly sixty years. The Founder and Music Director of The New York Pops, Skitch Henderson was one of the most recognized musical personalities in America. His career included appearances with orchestras throughout the world, and his collaboration with such artists as Judy Garland, Frank Sinatra, and Bing Crosby was legendary. He became known to millions throughout America as music director at NBC Television, where he conducted the Tonight show and the Today show orchestras, introducing the use of classical music in variety programming. Mr. Henderson was a featured artist in Steinway & Sons' Centennial concert at Carnegie Hall in 1953, and his devotion to the Steinway piano and to our firm knew no bounds. Though our lives have been forever enriched by his music, his ebullient spirit will be sorely missed. To Ruth and to his children and grandchildren, we extend our love and our heartfelt condolences. -Bruce A. Stevens, President -Peter B. Goodrich, V.P. Worldwide Concert and Artist Activities
