        LEBER--Edith. We share in the grief of Bernice, David and Aaron upon the loss of Bernice's mother, Edith Leber. She was a brave, intelligent woman with a warm heart and a great sense of humor. Fortunately, she was able to survive the Holocaust and share in the joys and successes of her children and grandchildren in America.
