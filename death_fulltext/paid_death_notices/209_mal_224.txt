On behalf of the Board and Staff of the American Friends of the Tel Aviv Museum of Art and the Tel Aviv Museum, we extend our deepest sympathy to Shirley on the loss of her devoted husband. Shirley and Miles, loyal and generous Board members, were honored in 2001 with AFTAM's Patrons of the Arts Award. We have all lost a wonderful friend. May Shirley and the entire Fiterman family be comforted by knowing that Miles was loved and respected by all. Rest in peace.
