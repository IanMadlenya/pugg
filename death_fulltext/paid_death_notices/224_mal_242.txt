        BOOKSON--Paul. The Eldridge Street Project, the nonsectarian cultural organization dedicated to restoring the historic Eldridge Street Synagogue, mourns the loss of Judge Paul P.E. Bookson. As President of Congregation K'hal Adath Jeshurun, he dedicated himself to ensuring continued religious life at the 118-year-old house of worship. With his devoted and beloved life Tova, he embraced the Project as long-term partner in transforming this National Historic Landmark into a Jewish heritage center for future generations. Learned, dynamic, determined, kind, he'll be greatly missed. Our deepest condolences to the entire family. Michael Weinstein, Chairman Roberta Brandes Gratz Founder Lorinda Ash Ezersky President Amy E. Waterman Executive Dir.
