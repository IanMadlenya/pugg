        MARKOWITZ-Alfred., M.D. The Faculty and Staff of Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons mourn the loss of our dear friend and colleague, Dr. Alfred Markowitz. Dr. Markowitz served the medical center for nearly half a century, contributing greatly to medical education, research and practice. He was an outstanding educator, clinician and researcher who will be particularly remembered by the countless medical students and surgical residents he trained. Dr. Markowitz was Professor Emeritus of Clinical Surgery at the time of his death. He will be missed and his memory cherished. We extend our deepest sympathy to the Markowitz family. Thomas Q. Morris, M.D. Interim Dean for Clinical and Educational Affairs. Columbia Univ. College of Physicians & Surgeons David I.
