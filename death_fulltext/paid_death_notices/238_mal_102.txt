        $(6$)GAMBACORTA--Leo. The Staff of Carnegie Hall is deeply saddened by the sudden passing of our dear friend and colleague, Leo Gambacorta. Leo joined the staff in August 2001, but his association with Carnegie Hall predated his employment here by many years. A legend in the concert production field, he worked often at the Hall during the previous decades as production manager for the JVC Jazz Festival and for many leading artists and ensembles, particularly in jazz and pop music. As Production Manager for Carnegie Hall, Leo brought the knowledge and discipline of a seasoned professional. Moreover, he fostered and furthered a team spirit, engendering the respect for all. He also brought a special sense of humor to his job, which helped to manage challenges to ensure the best outcomes. Everyone who knew Leo valued his contribution as a human being as well as a great professional. We at Carnegie Hall will miss him deeply, and we send our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Susan Kaplan; to his brothers, John and Michael; and to his parents, Humbert and Esther Gambacorta. Clive Gillinson, Executive and Artistic Director
