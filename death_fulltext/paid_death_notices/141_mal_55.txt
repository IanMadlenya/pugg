        BAUM-Joseph. The Trustees, Faculty, Staff, and Students of the Culinary Institute of America mourn the death of Joseph Baum, pioneer and visionary in the foodservice industry. Mr. Baum's history with the CIA spans three decades including dedicated service as a board member and lifetime member of the Corporation. In 1995, he became one of only ten individuals inducted into the CIA's ''Hall of Fame''. He will always be remembered for his support of Culinary Education and students will continue to benefit from the Joseph Baum endowed scholarship Fund at the CIA long into the future. Our deepest sympathies are extended to his wife Ruth, his daughter Hilary, his sons Charles and Edward, and the entire Baum family.
        BAUM-Joseph. The Zagat Survey salutes Joseph Baum as one of the great restaurateurs of this century without whom such restaurants as Windows On The World, The Four Seasons and The Rainbow Room would not exist. Joe was always generous to the public, for example, in creating the $19.90's Lunch Program.
