        JOHNSON-Una E. The Board of Trustees and the Staff of the Brooklyn Museum of Art record with deep sorrow the passing of their long time colleague and good friend Una E. Johnson and extend their condolences to her family. Ms. Johnson joined the Museum in 1936 as Assistant Curator of Prints and Drawings. In 1941 she was appointed Curator, a position she held until her retirement in 1969. Responsible for the growth of the Museum's collection of 20th century American prints, she also created the National Print Exhibition and organized sixteen during her tenure. Her memory will endure through these and her many other invaluable contributions.
