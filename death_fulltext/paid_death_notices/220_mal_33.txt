        SCHWARTZ -- Lawrence, M.D. Beloved husband of Puah and father of Gil and Ethan. A humane and learned physician who cared deeply for his patients as he cared for his own family. A proud City College graduate, he revered science and history, loved his country in whose army he served, and his religious homeland of Israel. The family would appreciate if remembrances from patients, colleagues and friends could be sent to the Schwartz family, PMB #
