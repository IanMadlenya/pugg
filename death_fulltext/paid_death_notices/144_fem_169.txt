        ITO-Cherel Winett. Born on May 5th, 1947, photographer and filmmaker, died January 10, 1999. Ms. Ito was the widow of musician Teiji Ito, with whom she sometimes performed and with whom she made the widely shown documentary film about Haitian Voudoun, ''Divine Horsemen'', utilizing the footage and music recorded in Haiti by Maya Deren in 1947 to 1955. An accomplished film editor, Cherel Ito will perhaps best be remembered for her black and white still photographs. Startling in their beauty, these works reveal her natural instinct for stylized composition and her deep sensitivity to the human condition. Cherel Ito is survived by her mother, Mimi Feldman, her stepdaughter, Tavia Ito, and her three brothers, Dr. Gary Stolzoff, Jeffrey and Bob Winett. The estate of Maya Deren, which Ms. Ito administered, has been conveyed to Daren scholar Catrina Neiman, New York City. The important Daren collection of Haitian ritual objects and art which Ito cared for has been donated to The Museum of Natural History's African American collection, New York City. The memorial service will be held Monday evening, January 18, 1999 at 7:00 PM at 814 Broadway, third floor. Donations in the name of Cherel Ito can be made to Gilda's Club, 195 West Houston Street, New York, New York 10014.
