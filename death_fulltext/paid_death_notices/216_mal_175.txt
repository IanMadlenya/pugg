        MORREL--Dr. Melvin. We mourn the loss of this respected and loving man who died on January 11, 2005 at the age of 81. Dr. Morrel practiced medicine in Amityville for over 50 years. He was a member of the medical executive board, president of the hospital staff, and chief of family medicine at Brunswick Hospital. He was also a clinical adjunct professor at Stonybrook School of Medicine. Brunswick Hospital recently honored Dr. Morrel for all that he has meant to the community for over 50 years. A renaissance man: an accomplished photographer, musician, long distance cyclist, and record-making sports fisherman. He is survived by his loving wife Harriet, his children Abby Morrel Mendillo, Owen, Beth, and Howard, as well as eight grandchildren: Jennifer, Stephanie, Jacqueline, Elizabeth, Rosa, Daniel, Luke and Tyler.
