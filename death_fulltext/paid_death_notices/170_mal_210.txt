        TAYLOR-Guy, 1919-2001. Age 81, a widely known symphony conductor, died in Edmonds, Washington on March 5th, 2001. Formerly music director of the Nashville Symphony, the Phoenix Symphony, and the Fresno Philharmonic Orchestras, his work was instrumental in bringing those organizations to the major, or near-major, status they now hold. As a guest conductor, he appeared in every region of the United States as well as in Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, Great Britain, Germany and Czechoslovakia. Mr. Taylor retired to Edmonds in 1989, where he has written two books -a comprehensive family history and a book of professional memoirs. Mr. Taylor was trained principally at the Juilliard School of Music in New York, where he was married in 1947 to a fellow student, pianist Renee Lifton. Other training included private study, classes and symposia with Dimitri Mitropoulos, Eugene Ormandy, Pierre Monteux and George Szell. His early studies were as a violinist with Ottokar Cadek in his native Alabama. In addition to his wife, Renee, Mr. Taylor is survived by a son, Eric Taylor, of Stockton, California, and a daughter, Ellen Taylor, of Seattle, Washington; two granddaughters, Megan Taylor of Stockton and Hannah Dalglish of Seattle; and three step-grandchildren, John Taylor of Stockton, Pablo Dalglish of Seattle, and Gabriel Dalglish of Sao Paulo, Brazil.
