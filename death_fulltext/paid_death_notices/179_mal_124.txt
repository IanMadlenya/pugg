        COUNTEE-Roger W., M.D. We mourn the death of Roger Countee. Dr. Countee completed his neurosurgical training at the Neurological Institute of New York, Columbia University in 1975. He was a dedicated and caring physician, outstanding surgeon, respected colleague and a dear friend. Our deepest sympathy goes to his wife, Jane, and his wonderful children and family.
