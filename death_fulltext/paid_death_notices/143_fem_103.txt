        COHEN-Esther. On December 10, 1998, at the age of 94. Esther came to this country from Poland alone as a young girl. The center of her life was her family and the state of Israel. She was the beloved wife of the late Morris Cohen; the devoted mother of Renee and Ralph Blumenthal and Herb and Ellen Cohen; the adoring grandmother of David and Karen Blumenthal, Robert and Helene Blumenthal, Meryl and Jim Orlando, Sharon and Bill Levin, Steven and Lisa Cohen and Rich Cohen; the proud great-grandmother of Michael, Jill, Seth, Lindsay, Ryan, Jessica, Danny, Matt, Madeline, David, Ethan and Emma. An avid Zionist, Esther worked tirelessly for the state of Israel, continuously raising money for Hadassah, The United Jewish Appeal and B'nai B'rith. She was honored by the state of Israel for her years of continuous service. Her tremendous spirit, fierce pride, devotion to her family and her kliskels will be missed by her family and friends. Services will be held Sunday, 10 AM, at Weinstein West End Funeral Chapel, 1283 Coney Island Ave, Brooklyn. Contributions in Esther's memory may be made to Hadassah.
