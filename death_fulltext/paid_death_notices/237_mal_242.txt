Heller, who served with great distinction for many years as Vice Chairman of the SLR Board of Trustees and, subsequently, as a member of the Trustee Board of SLR's parent company, Continuum Health Partners until 2005. During his service to SLR, he held leadership positions for many programs and initiatives, including the Institute for Health Science and the Miller Institute for Performing Artists.
