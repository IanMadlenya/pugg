        WEINREB-Herman, M.D. Passed away suddenly on April 14. A Clincal Associate Professor of Neurology at the NYU School of Medicine, Dr Weinreb was deeply compassionate and intensely devoted to his patients. The quintessential academic, he was an engaging teacher and innovative course director. He provided energetic leadersip to the Neurology Service of the Manhattan Veterans Administration Medical Center for many years and diligently fostered linkages between Psychiatry and Neurology. Herman was humble, kind, generous and full of humor. He will be sorely missed. Our faculty and staff mourn his untimely death and extend deepest sympathies to his beloved family. Edwin H. Kolodny, M.D. Department of Neurology NYU School of Medicine
