        SHEPARD--Burton L, on May 8, 2007 at age 89. Beloved husband of Sarah, survived by his son Barry, daughter-inlaw Susan, granddaughters Allison, Jacklyn, and Rebecca, stepchildren Susan and Michael Berkowitz. Burton was a devoted husband and father, highly accomplished CPA, loyal NY sports fan, and persevering golfer. An eternal optimist, Burton believed hard work and desire could conquer all of life's challenges. In lieu of flowers, the family welcomes contributions to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Association, Alzheimer's Association or American Parkinsons Disease Association.
