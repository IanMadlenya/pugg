He was the greatest and most prolific inventor and marketer in the history of the domestics industry. His most notable accomplishment was the Bed Sack which achieved national fame. He was an accomplished pioneer. He was a substantial contributor to many charities, always in a self-effacing, quiet way. He helped many, many people in a like manner. He had an abundance of hidden warmth, plus a plethora of brains, knowledge and sense of humor. Ephraim, you paid for the last drink. This one is on me. There aren't any doctors in the land beyond the sky, only bartenders, so ask for a double. Rest in peace, you more than deserve it. Alvin L. Levine
