        HOOK--Lucyle, Ph.D. The Barnard College community mourns the loss of beloved Professor Emerita Lucyle Hook. She was an inspired teacher of English to Barnard students from 1948 to 1967. She was also a generous benefactor, establishing funds for student and academic support and maintaining a keen interest in the College and its students after her retirement. Professor Hook is remembered with deep affection and profound admiration by her friends and colleagues and by generations of Barnard alumnae.
