        BING-Rudolf. Columbia Artists Management Inc. is deeply saddened by the loss of our friend and colleague, Sir Rudolf Bing. During his many years as General Manager of the Metropolitan Opera, Sir Rudolf made extraordinary contributions to the field. He instilled a new atmosphere of artistic discipline and introduced American audiences to the world's greatest singers, directors and stage designers. Sir Rudolf's vision and guidance were inspirational to our company and the artists we represent, both during his tenure at the Metropolitan Opera and in the years following, when he served as a member of CAMI's Board of Directors and as a Vice President (1974-1987). We remember him with great affection and esteem. Ronald A. Wilford, President and the Board of Directors Columbia Artists Mgmnt Inc.
