        DeALESSANDRO-Joseph P. The trustees, faculty, staff and students of The Culinary Institute of America (CIA) mourn the death of Joseph P. DeAlessandro, Honorary Member of the Board of Trustees and Honorary Alumnus. Mr. DeAlessandro received an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from the college in 1999 in recognition of his generous support of culinary education. The main dining room in the CIA's Ristorante Caterina de' Medici is named in his honor. Our deepest sympathies are extended to Mr. DeAlessandro's family, friends, and colleagues.
