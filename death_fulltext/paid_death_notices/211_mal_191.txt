        PIRAINO--Vin B. Died August 14, 2004, age 67. The Jazz Community will miss one of its greatest fans as Vin lost his battle with cancer ''All Too Soon''. He'll be sorely missed by family, friends and many lucky enough to have known him. He was kind, caring and generous and could make you laugh 'til your sides ached. He was smart, intuitive and deeply sensitive to the plight of others--a real mensch. And his passion for Jazz was legendary. He has now left us for that better place of Eternal Rest free of worry, pain and strife. Our loss is Heaven's gain. Rest in Peace in that special domain of Heavenly Jazz. ''And The Angels Sing''.
