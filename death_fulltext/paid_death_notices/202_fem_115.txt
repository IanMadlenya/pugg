        BIDWELL--Katharine O'Neil. The board and staff of the Metropolitan Opera Guild are profoundly saddened by the death of Katharine O'Neil Bidwell, President of the Guild from 1979 to 1986, and a valued member of our board since 1966.

Our deepest sympathies go to her husband, Truman, and her children, Molly, Stephen and Thomas. Winthrop Rutherfurd, Jr., Chairman Susan S. Braddock, President David A. Dik, Managing Director
