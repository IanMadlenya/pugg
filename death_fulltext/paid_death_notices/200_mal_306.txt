        MODIGLIANI -- Franco. On September 25, 2003. The Trustees, faculty and staff of New School University mourn the loss of Franco Modigliani, an alumnus of, and former Professor at the Graduate Faculty of Political and Social Science. The winner of the 1985 Nobel Prize for Economics for his theories about people's savings habits and the functioning of financial markets, he also irreversibly changed the way the world understood Keynesian economics. His death has deprived the economics profession of an energetic, independent and powerful mind. Our condolences to his wife Serena, two sons, Andre and Sergio, four grandchildren and three great grandchildren. An academic conference in his honor is being planned for the Spring. Philip Scaturro, Chairman, Board of Trustees Bob Kerrey, President, New School University Michael E. Gellert, Trustee and Chairman, Board of Governors Walter A. Eberstadt, Trustee and Member, Board of Governors Richard J. Bernstein, Dean, Graduate Faculty
