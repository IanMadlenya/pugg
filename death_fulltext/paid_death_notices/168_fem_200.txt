        FREEDMAN - Patty. Always shared a warm smile, a genuine laugh, a friendly nonjudgmental ear and a sincere caring with each of us. She was ''Mom'' to many, regardless of their age, and support to all. Her spirit endures and lives through us. We have been fortunate to have had her help us ''Discover the Spirit''. Our hearts and sympathy reach out to her beloved Ed, Amanda and Jeff. Marla and George, Jordan and Ross, and the rest of the ''Coleman Country Family''
