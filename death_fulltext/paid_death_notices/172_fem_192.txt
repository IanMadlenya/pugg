        PELL-Lucy Blow Jeffcott. Cotty Pell died on May 22 at the age of 82 in her house in Porto Ercole. Diagnosed with terminal cancer 20 years ago, she beat the odds as she so often did. She is survived by two sons, Peter of Glen Cove, NY, and Haven of Washington, D.C., and by five grandchildren. Cotty will be buried in Porto Ercole on Friday, May 25, and there will be no memorial service. In lieu of flowers, please take a moment to do something you might have enjoyed doing with her.
