Upon his retirement he served as a trustee for 18 years. His impact on the Guild and on Chelsea was extraordinary; in addition, he was a major leader in the Settlement House movement and a true pioneer for many social issues, most notably affordable housing. Dan was admired for his wit, astuteness, and tenacity and was consulted by many even after his relocation to Arizona last year. Lee Buckley, President Paul F. Balser, Chairman Janice McGuire, Executive Director
