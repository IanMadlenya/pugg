        BERNSTEIN-Henry C. The leadership and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Henry C. Bernstein, cherished father, beloved husband, cham pion of Jewish causes. His dedication to those who needed help was as passionate as his devotion to communal service. From 1942-1970, he served with distinction as executive vice president of United Jewish Appeal of Greater New York, a forerunner of UJAFederation. To his son, Dr. Alan Bernstein, and his entire family, we send our deepest sympathies. May you be consoled among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair Louise B. Greilsheimer, President Stephen D. Solender, Exec. V.P.
