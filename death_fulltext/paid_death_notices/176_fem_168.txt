        SCHUTZ-Ruth, age 85, died peacefully in her home in Manhattan's Greenwich Village. She is survived by her loving husband of 61 years, Nathan R.; adoring children, Carol and Tom; devoted grandchildren, Michael and Daniel; loyal sisters, Gertrude and Sylvia; wonderful brother and sister-in-law, Bernie and Adeline. Because she lived, loved and taught art, she helped leave this world a slightly better place than she found it. She will long be remembered for her intelligence, her beauty and her devotion to her family and the arts. Services to be held Thursday, September 20, 2001, 10 AM at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. Donations can be made to Jacob Perlow Hospice of Beth Israel Hospital or the American Red Cross.
