        GREEN-Betty. The officers, leadership, and staff of UJAFederation of New York mourn the passing of Betty Green, who taught the value of Tzedakah to her family. Her son, Jeffrey Stern, is a leader in the Jewish community and is active in the Wall Street Division Steering Committee. Her daughter-in-law, Susan Stern, is a member of our Board of Directors as well as incoming chair of the Women's Campaign. We extend our deepest sympathies to her children, Jeffrey and Susan Stern, and Gail and Michael Lenvin; her grandchildren, Michael and Peter Stern, and David and Amanda Lenvin; and the entire family. May you be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Larry A. Silverstein, Board Chair Louise B. Greilsheimer, President Stephen D. Solender, Exec. V.P.
