        GEROSA-Martha Jane Berry, devoted and faithful wife of Alfred George Gerosa for fifty-three years, beloved mother of Martha Anne Gerosa and Nina Berry Gerosa, loving grandmother of Jason and Diana Fulton and Jesse and Asia McGrath-Gerosa, caring sister of Allen and William Berry, died peacefully at her home on September 20th, 2002, in the presence of her husband and children. She graduated from the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia in 1952 with a B.S. in Education. She was a very active member in her church and served for a number of years as the Treasurer of the Altar Guild. She was a passionate pianist and animal lover and not only supported groups which protected wildlife but also actively cared for animals in her backyard. She had great compassion for others in the community and received much pleasure from serving as a volunteer and Treasurer for Meals on Wheels, both because of the people with whom she visited and the people with whom she worked. A Memorial Service will be held on September 28th, 2002, at 2:30 P.M. at the Church of St. Joseph of Arimathea located on Route 9A in Elmsford, New York. The family requests that donations be given to Meals on Wheels, Municipal Building, 1 Heineman Place, Harrison, N.Y. 10528, or the Saw Mill River Audubon Society, 275 Millwood Road, Chappaqua, N.Y. 10514, in lieu of flowers.
