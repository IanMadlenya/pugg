        HAAR-George. The Jewish Community Center of Fort Lee is profoundly saddened and deeply mourns the passing of an esteemed member of it's Board of Trustees and Co-Chairman of its Ritual Committee. He was a very generous benefactor and guiding light to our Synagogue. George led by example and set the standard for all to follow. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his beloved wife, Arline; his children Geoffrey and Jane, Dr. Robert and Beth, Gary and Natalie; his seven grandchildren; his brother Murray and sister Frances. He was a fine, dignified gentleman and leader who will be sorely missed. Steven Kolitch, President Irving Spielman, Rabbi Paul Zim, Cantor Larry Trope, Executive Director
