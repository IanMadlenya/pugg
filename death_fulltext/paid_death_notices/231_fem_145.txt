        CHRISTOS--Marianna. New York City Opera deeply mourns the untimely passing of American soprano, Marianna Christos. From her 1975 debut as Liu in Turandot through 1988, she was a company mainstay in Italian and French romantic repertory, turning in vivid performances of signature roles including Mimi and Musetta in Boheme, Violetta in Traviata, Margherita in Mefistofele, Nedda in Pagliacci, Marguerite in Faust, Micaela in Carmen (in our telecast performance), Antonia in Tales of Hoffmann and Leila in The Pearl Fishers. Her dark, distinctive voice and dynamic stage presence are no less memorable to us than her down-to-earth, ebullient personality and irrepressible sense of humor. In recent years, she had begun sharing her gifts with vocal students at Duquesne University, her alma mater, and in her private studios in New York City and at her home in Stamford, CT. We extend our deepest sympathy to her husband Alan Kays (also a longtime City Opera company member), her son Nicholas, and all of her family and countless friends. She will truly be missed.
