        FISHER-David. He filled his years with unconditional love for his family and an unmitigated and unbridled joy for life. Indeed, everyone of his 92 years was seen through the eyes of a mischievous, playful child-teaching us all to live life exuberantly and passionately. Survived lovingly by wife Marion of 60 years, daughter Judie and son-in-law Roy, sister Lillian, grandchildren Jason, Basha and her husband Zalmen, and great-grandchildren Malka and Bracha.
