        WHITE-Robert W. Age 60, on April 19, 2000 at home. Beloved husband of Elissa; loving father of Matthew White and Martin Adler; devoted to the Waters family, and longtime friend to many. Author, inventor, artist and teacher, he took the road less traveled and we are the richer for it. We will miss him deeply and mourn the loss of one of the world's most loving, compassionate, intelligent and honest men. Even at the end his sense of humor uplifted us all.
