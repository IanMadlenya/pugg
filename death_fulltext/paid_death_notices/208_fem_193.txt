        SAVARD--Judith, RSHM. The Board of Trustees, the President, the Faculty, Administration, Students and Alumni of Marymount Manhattan College join the founders of the College, the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary, in mourning the sudden passing of Judith Savard, RSHM, a precious colleague and friend who had been teaching at the College for 38 years and had been a vibrant center of the programs in studio art and art history. Her outstanding teaching skills and gentle presence as a colleague and mentor to students will be greatly missed.
