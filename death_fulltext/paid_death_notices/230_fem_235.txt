        PHANG--Helen. As someone who had the privilege of working with Helen Phang for 20 years, I want to express my infinite gratitude for the knowledge and assistance she gave me. Helen was one of those rare individuals who was not afraid to speak her mind or do what she believed was the right thing. For all this and more I will always remember her with affection. My deepest condolences to her daughter Peggy and the rest of her family. Mark A. Jofe, MD
