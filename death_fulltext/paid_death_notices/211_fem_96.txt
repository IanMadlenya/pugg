        DAKSS--Rose Ludmer. We note with great saddness the passing of Rose Ludmer Dakss on August 14, 2004. In her 94 years, she enriched the lives of everyone who knew her. A unique woman and a life long learner, she received her Bachelor of Arts in 1930 and her Master of Science in Education in 1965. As a devoted kindergarten teacher for 25 years, she recognized the inherent goodness in all children. Her roles as wife, mother, grandmother and great grandmother were characterized by unconditional love and enormous generosity. She danced through life and she will be greatly missed. Donations may be made to the Rose L. Dakss Early Childhood Education Fund at Montclair State University, Department of Curriculum and Teaching, College of Education and Human Resources, Normal Avenue, Montclair NJ 07043. The graveside service will be held on Wednesday, August 18 at 1:30 PM at Beth Moses Cemetery in Farmingdale NY.
