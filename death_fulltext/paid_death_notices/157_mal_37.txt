        REID-Robert. 82, suddenly on January 30. Bob Reid's encyclopedic knowledge of music and recordings was legendary and he will be sorely missed by his many friends and associates in the music world. He is survived by his brother Richard, sister-in-law Connie, many nieces and nephews, and by Jack McNeil, his loving companion for 48 years. There will be no service, but friends may make a donation to the Lesbian & Gay Community Services Center, 1 Little West 12 St, New York, New York 10014.
