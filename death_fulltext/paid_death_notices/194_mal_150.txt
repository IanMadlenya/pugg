        GROSSMAN-Cary. In his 33 years Cary touched so many lives. He was beautiful and he lived a beautiful life. He lived more life in his 33 years than most people live or know about in a lifetime. He was the most gentle, loving, fabulous son his mother, Lynne, and his father, Robert, could ever wish for. He was the best brother his sister Alison could ever have. They shared a very special relationship. He was the best friend and most loving husband Christine could ever have. He was the best uncle Daniela could ever have. He was the best brother-in law David could ever have. He was the best grandson Annette could ever have. He was the best grandson Marian could ever have. Cary was an inspiration to us all. To those who loved Cary, and were helped by him, his memory will be eternal. If he was your friend...you were made! He grew up in Head of the Harbor and Montauk, New York. As a little boy he worked in and around the waters of Montauk. His passion for the sea and his love of boating was an integral part of his life. As an adult his goals and achievements were nothing short of spectacular! Some people come into our lives and quietly go. Others stay for a while and leave footprints on our hearts and we are never the same. We mourn, oh how we mourn the death of our dear Cary. He was truly an extraordinary gift for life, for hope, for friendship, for love and generosity. He was open, he was guileless, he was one of a kind. In our hearts and in our memories his light and spirit will be with us always. What we have once treasured, we can never lose. All that we love deeply becomes a part of us. Cary Grossman left this earth on March 6, 2003, due to a sudden heart attack in his home in Florida. Cary, we will love you forever. ''Do not stand by his grave and weep. He is not dead, he does not sleep. Do not stand by his grave and cry. He is not there, he did not die.''
