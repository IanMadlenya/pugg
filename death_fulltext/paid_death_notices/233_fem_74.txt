        BARKER--Chrissie Head of communications for JWT in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, passed away Friday, June 9, after a brave battle against cancer. Over more than a decade at JWT, Chrissie worked passionately and tirelessly to ensure that the agency, its leadership and its work were portrayed in positive light. A former editor of ''Campaign'', the British trade magazine, and a columnist for the ''London Evening Standard'', Chrissie was highly respected and enormously networked within the industry. Her huge circle of friends from all over the world will miss her warmth, her sense of humor, her loyalty, and her joie de vivre. Full of curiosity, pluck and opinons, Chrissie's main passion was her love for her husband, Mike Townsin, and her children, Luke and Georgie. Like them, we'll miss her tremendously.
