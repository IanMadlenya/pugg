        SCHMIDT-Benno C. The Boards of Overseers and Managers, the leadership and staff of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center mourn the death of Benno C. Schmidt, our colleague, mentor and friend. Benno's contributions to this institution and to our nation defy description and categorization. He was a giant. As one of the architects of the National Cancer Program, Benno helped lay the foundation for the National Cancer Act and the nation's extraordinary investment in biomedical research. Through nearly four decades of commitment to Memorial Sloan-Kettering-including a lengthy tenure as Chairman-he shaped and strengthened our institution. Benno's own words are the most eloquent testimony to the challenge he undertook: ''I wish there were a faster way, that we could cure disease without going through the laborious process of trying to understand it. Unfortunately there are no shortcuts. In the most literal sense of the words: life is not that simple.'' Cancer patients and their families, the biomedical community and Memorial Sloan-Kettering will be forever in his debt. Laurance S. Rockefeller, Honorary Co-Chairman James D. Robinson III Honorary Co-Chairman Douglas A. Warner III Chairman H. Virgil Sherrill, Vice Chairman Richard L. Gelb Vice Chairman Paul A. Marks, M.D., President, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
