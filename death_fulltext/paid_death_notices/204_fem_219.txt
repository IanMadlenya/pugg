        FORD--Ann Postma, 81, died peacefully at home on January 19th, 2004, holding hands with her beloved husband of 55 years, Frank W. Ford, Jr.; and her devoted daughter JoAnn Ford of Westport, CT. Ann dedicated her energy and good judgment to a number of charitable and educational groups. She was President of the Parents Organization at Trinity School and devoted much time and effort to the Civil Division of the Legal Aid Society, chairing the 1971 Legal Aid Auction. Ann's journey through Russia as a U.S. Youth Delegate to Jr U.N. meetings in London and Moscow in 1945-46 ended with severe mastoid infections in both ears. The Russians cured Ann with their limited supply of the new miracle drug Penicillin. This experience rightly convinced Ann that the American and Russian peoples are indeed similar and should indeed live peacefully together. Ann's tireless compassion for others, her steadfast devotion to efforts to achieve peace among all nations, and her loving care of family and friends will be sorely missed. Services Friday, January 23, 1:30 PM at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Ave at 81st St. Reception immediately following at the University Club, 5th Ave and 54 St. Donations in Ann's memory may be made to New Fairfield Animal Welfare Society, PO Box 8232, New Fairfield, CT 06812.
