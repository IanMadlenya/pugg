        PERONI -- Geraldine. We deeply mourn the loss of our friend. Gerri brought her passion to her work, her friends, and her politics. A brilliant film editor, a wise, sensitive and generous friend, and a devoted sister, aunt, and cousin, Gerri was a woman of great style, love, and fierce loyalty. We will always love you, Gerri. You will be in our hearts forever. Memorial service on Friday at 11 AM, St. Veronica's Church, Christopher Street, NYC.
