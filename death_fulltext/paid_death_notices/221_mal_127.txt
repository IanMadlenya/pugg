One of the most distinguished composers of the 20th century, he helped establish a distinctly American approach to works for orchestra. In addition to his remarkable compositions, David was an active and effective teacher of composition at Juilliard from 1973 to 1997. He recently received an inaugural Juilliard medal at the School's commencement on May 20. His friends, colleagues, and former students will deeply miss him, but his great musical legacy will live forever. Bruce Kovner, Chairman Joseph W. Polisi, President
