        WYLER-Marjorie. The Jewish Theological Seminary of America mourns the passing of Marjorie Goldwasser Wyler, who served with distinction for more than fifty years. Her intellectual vigor and dedicated work as head of the communications department helped position JTS as a force for Jewish life in the larger community, bringing Judaism to the American public and giving Jews a better appreciation of their own heritage. We extend our deepest sympathies to the entire family and pray that her memory be for a blessing. Ismar Schorsch, Chancellor Gershon Kekst, Chairman
