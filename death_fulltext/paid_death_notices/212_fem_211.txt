        CARDULLO -- June Moore, M.D. Died suddenly on September 22, 2004, from injuries sustained when she was struck by an automobile while walking in her hometown of Pompton Plains, New Jersey. Born June 19, 1927 in Bayonne, New Jersey, she graduated from Barnard College in 1947 and received her medical degree from New York University in 1951. Dr. Cardullo interned in pediatrics at Bellevue Hospital and completed her residency at St. Vincent's Hospital, in New York City. She was a fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics and a member of the American Medical Association. Married to Hugo M. Cardullo, also a pediatrician, the two were in private practice in Pompton Plains for nearly 40 years. ''Dr. June'' as she was affectionately known, continued to practice part-time after the death of her husband in 1996. Most recently she was the medical director of the Wanaque Health Department. In her spare time, she continued to take CME courses, as well as classes in arts and literature at NYU and Barnard College. Dr. June also traveled widely and gardened enthusiastically. Her son, Mark, predeceased Dr. Cardullo in 2001. She is survived by three daughters: Alice Cardullo, M.D. of New York City, Lauren Cardullo Thompson, V.M.D. of Armonk, N.Y. and Susan Cardullo Topping, Esq., of Lincoln Park, N.J. She had four grandchildren, Natalie, Nicholas, Kevin and Christopher. A memorial service will be held on October 9, 2004 at the Holy Spirit R.C. Church in Pequannock, N.J. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations to the Salvation Army-Wanaque Health Dept. Unit, Barnard College or the National Shrine of St. Jude, Chicago, IL.
