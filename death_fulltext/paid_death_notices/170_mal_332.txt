        KAPLAN-Rev. Solomon. The Officers, Board, members, clergy and staff of Shaarei Tikvah, the Scarsdale Conservative Congregation note with profound sadness the passing of our beloved ritual director, Rev. Solomon Kaplan, on March 24th, 2001. Rev. Kaplan touched many lives, both young and old, with his devoted love of Judaism, his spiritual knowledge and leadership, and his lifelong dedication to Jewish education. Rev. Kaplan was the guiding light of Emanuel Jewish Center in Mt. Vernon for many years. His kindness, gentleness, wisdom and compassion will be sorely missed. We extend our deepest condolences to his entire loving family. Contributions may be made to Shaarei Tikvah-Rev. Solomon Kaplan Fund, 46 Fox Meadow Rd., Scarsdale, NY 10583, or to Hospice of Westchester-Caregiver Program, 95 South Broadway, White Plains, NY 10601.
