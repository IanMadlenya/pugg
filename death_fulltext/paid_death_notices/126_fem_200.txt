        WEINER-Harry. Bar-Ilan University in Israel and its American friends extend to Mrs. Nina A. Weiner and her entire family its sincerest condolences on the loss of her beloved father-in-law. Among many, our University has been the beneficiary of generous and warm support from her and the family for many years, and we pray that they will derive comfort from their continuing service to Klal Ysisroel.
