        GROSSMAN-Sidney. With the deepest sense of loss, his devoted family announces the passing of our indomitable patriarch. For every day of his 86 years he lived life to the fullest, with unconditional love for his family, commitment to philanthropic causes and passion for all that is just and decent in the world. His playful sense of humor, breadth of interests and boundless energy rendered every day of his life an adventure. He will be profoundly missed by Bunny (Beatrice), his beloved wife of 62 years; his children Nancy, Judy and Steven, Gary and Lynn; his grandchildren Robert and Amy, Andrew and Alyson, Michael and Daniel; his great-grandchildren Adam and Julie; and his sister and soulmate Shirley. The Legend will live in our memories forever. Services on Monday, April 16, 2001 at 10:30 AM, Hewlett East Rockaway Jewish Center, 295 Main Street, East Rockaway.
