        FINKLE-Joel. The Palm Beach Orthodox Synagogue mourns the passing of its dedicated member Joel Finkle Z''L who with his dear wife Maria was guided throughout his life by a deep committment to Jewish values, philanthropy and Jewish community service. By his example of outstanding deeds and personal humility, he inspired us all to the highest level of our Torah teachings. We hope and pray that his memory will serve as a beacon of light to guide Maria and the entire family in the years ahead. Dr. Edward L. Steinberg Dr. Michael Gelfand Co-Presidents Rabbi Moshe Scheiner
