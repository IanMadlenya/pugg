        GUNNING-Rosemary. The Advisory Council to the Housing Part of the Civil Court mourns the passing of Rosemary Gunning. As a State Assemblywoman, Rosemary sponsored the legislation which created the Housing Court. For more than two decades, until her retirement last year, Rosemary served as a stalwart member of the Advisory Council, devoting her indefatigable energy, piercing intelligence and infectious wit to nurturing and strengthening the Housing Court, which appropriately has been called ''Rosemary's Baby.'' Rosemary will be sorely missed, but never forgotten. David Rosenberg, Chair
