        BRYAN-Pauline (Polly). April 12, 1999, in La Jolla, CA. Descendant of John Alden. From early life in Joplin, MO. to school in the East: Vassar (AB 1933), Columbia (MA 1935). Teacher, editor, proofreader (American Heritage Dictionary, 1969), writer. On the staff of British Information Services (latterly as Head, Press Section, News Division), awarded M.B.E. by Queen Elizabeth II in 1972 for more than twenty-five years devoted to promoting understanding between the USA and Britain. Polly served Vassar College in many capacities: as a member of the AAVC Board of Directors, Chairman of the Alumnae House Committee, AAVC Representative to the Investor Responsibility Committee, President of the Class of 1933 and Chairman of the Class's 50th Reunion. As a volunteer for Vassar, whenever writing was needed to be lucid, fluent and concise, it was Polly who was called upon. Her love affair with the English language, merry companionship, generous spirit and enduring friendship endeared her to many. In retirement, she was active in seeking to alleviate pollution in all its forms and enjoyed happy avocations: travel, ballet theater, birdwatching-until the day in 1987 that her life was shattered by the carelessness of a bicyclist in Central Park. Friends may wish to honor Polly's memory by contributing to Vassar College Alumnae House, to which Polly gave so much of herself. Address: 61 Raymond Avenue, Poughkeepsie, New York 12603. Messages to Polly's good friend in La Jolla will be forwarded. A Long-time Vassar Friend
