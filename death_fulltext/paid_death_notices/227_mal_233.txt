        REISS--Arthur. Passed away on December 21, 2005 at the age of 92. Beloved husband and patriarch of an adoring family. Survived by his wife Arline and his children Roberta Miller (Joshua), Marvin Reiss (Susan) and Linda Heffner (Edward), his grandchildren and great-grandchildren. He was the epitome of a trully straightforward, successful businessman and a pillar of his secular and religious community. He was trusted and admired by his associates and family as a model of moral conduct in today's complex and confused world. He founded the I. Reiss and Son real estate investment firm with his father Isidor in 1930. Funeral services will be held at Riverside Memorial Chapel, Mount Vernon, New York at 12 noon on Thursday, December 22.
