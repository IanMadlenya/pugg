        HERMAN--Peter S. The Board of Directors and the Shareholders of The Cornwall mourn the untimely passing of our friend, neighbor and longtime board member. We will all miss his prodigious intelligence and humor. His tireless efforts on behalf of our building will be hard to replace. We extend our most heartfelt sympathies to his wife Susan, and sons David and Michael.
