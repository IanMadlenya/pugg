        DRESNER-Rabbi Samuel H. We record with profound sadness the passing of our beloved colleague, scholar and teacher. He was rabbi emeritus of Moriah Congregation in Chicago. As a congregational rabbi, he spearheaded the campaign for Jewish funeral reform and was an activist in the cause of civil rights, which led to his appointment as chairman of the Massachusetts State Human Relations Commission. A faculty member of the Jewish Theological Seminary since 1985, he is the author of numerous books and articles in the fields of Jewish mysticism and the American Jewish community as well as our publication, the Jewish Dietary Laws. We express our deepest condolences to his loving wife, Ruth, children, Hannah, Miriam, Drs. Nehama and Rachel and to all who were touched through his rabbinate. Rabbi Vernon H. Kurtz, Pres. Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Exec. VP The Rabbinical Assembly
