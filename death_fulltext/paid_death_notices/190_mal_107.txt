        BOZORTH-Squire Newland. Died on November 5, 2002 at age 67. He is survived by his beloved wife of 35 years, Louise Mathews Bozorth, by his son and daughter, Squire Mathews Bozorth, and Caroline Bozorth Sayan, his granddaughter, Laila Louise Bozorth, and his sisters, Caroline Bozorth Baumann, Linda Bozorth Weagant, Cheryl Bozorth Peters, and Janet Bozorth Boise. In his capacity as a Trust and Estates lawyer at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley and McCloy, he represented members of the Rockefeller family, Leon Hess, and Stavros Niarchos, among others. His charitable work included serving on the Board of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies for twenty years, as a Director of the Parks Council, a Trustee of International House, the Diocese of New York, and The Cathedral of Saint John the Divine. His sweet nature, sharp mind, kind heart and compassionate spirit touched all who knew him. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that contributions be made to The Cathedral Church of Saint John the Divine.
