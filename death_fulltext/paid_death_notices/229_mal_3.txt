        FEINBERG--Samuel. The Board of Directors of The Zamir Choral Foundation expresses its profound sorrow on the passing of Samuel Feinberg, beloved father of our esteemed Board Member, Vivian Lazar (and father-in-law of our Founder and Director, Matthew Lazar). May they and their extended family be comforted among the mourners for Zion and Jerusalem. His memory will surely be a blessing to all who knew him. Alan Septimus, President
