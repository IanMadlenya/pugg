        BELLAMY--Roger. Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater mourns the loss of Roger Bellamy, a passionate performer who joined his brother, Don, as a member of the Company from 1992-1997. We will miss his elegance, exuberant spirit and joyous laughter. A memorial service is planned for August 13 at 7:30 PM at the Ailey Studios.
