        BOYERS--Allan. Age 74, beloved husband of Constance Mayer Boyers, cherished father of Brian Boyers and Rand Boyers Peppas, loving grandfather of Philip, Eric, James, Thomas and Gianna, died on January 7, of leukemia. ''The Coach,'' as he was affectionately known, was a legend at The Dalton School, where he was the Director of Athletics, Head Football and Basketball Coach from 1957-1995. He was not only a coach and teacher, but a friend and mentor to thousands of students and he will be sorely missed. The funeral will be held on Tuesday, January 11, at 2:30 p.m at The Riverside, 76th and Amsterdam. Contributions in lieu of flowers may be sent to either the Daniel Heumann Fund for Spinal Cord Research, 6516 Truman Lane, Falls Church, VA 22043, or the Allan Boyers/Constance Mayer Scholarship Fund at The Dalton School, 108 East 89th Street, NY, 10128. A memorial service celebrating his life will be held in the spring.
        BOYERS--Allan. He was our dear friend and coached our three sons in basketball, but what he taught them went beyond athletic skills. He formed character by teaching about loyalty, commitment, fairness and responsibility. We will always be indebted to him for his kindness and giving of himself. To Connie, Rand, Brian, Sy and the Boyer's family we send our heartfelt sympathy. Adele and Carl Frischling
        BOYERS--Allan. A man of humor, honor and strength. You are loved and missed by many. The Casper and Caldarola families
