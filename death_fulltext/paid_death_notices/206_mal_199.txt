        VAN NORMAN--David L. The Board and staff of the Neighborhood Coalition for Shelter and the members of the Community Advisory Committee mourn the passing of a gentle and wise community leader who so ably chaired our Committee for so many years. We miss his strength and friendship. Our heartfelt condolences to Heather and the rest of his family.
