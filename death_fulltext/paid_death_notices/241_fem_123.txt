        $(6$)BIRCH--Patti Cadby. The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art mourn the passing of Honorary Trustee Patti Cadby Birch. Patti joined the MoMA Board of Trustees in 1995 and was elected an Honorary Trustee in 1998. During her tenure at the Museum, Patti served with dedication as a member of the International Council (since 1994), the Chairman's Council, the Library Council, and the Conservation Committee. We deeply appreciate her generosity to the Museum's expansion project and her memory will live on through The Patti Cadby Birch Garden Plaza. Her love of music, art and travel made her a wonderful companion wherever she was around the world. She will always be remembered as a warm and gracious hostess on many occasions, in Venice and elsewhere. The Trustees and staff are profoundly grateful for Patti's many contributions to the life of the Museum and will remember her with affection and high regard. Her great spirit will be sorely missed and we extend our sympathies to all members of the Birch family. David Rockefeller, Honorary Chairman Ronald S. Lauder, Chairman Emeritus Agnes Gund, President Emerita Robert B. Menschel, Chairman Marie-Jose Kravis, President Glenn D. Lowry, Director Brian Urquhart, Chairman Emeritus Agnes Gund, Chairman Jo Carole Lauder, President The International Council of The Museum of Modern Art
