        HOFFMANN-Rolf. We are very saddened by the passing of Rolf Hoffmann who died peacefully at home in Berlin after a long illness. He was a beloved member of The International Council of The Museum of Modern Art who brought great passion, intelligence, and spirit to the Council & to contemporary art throughout the world. A noted collector, Rolf frequently opened his collection to visitors with great generosity and enthusiasm. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Erika and their children, Alexander, Corrine, and Sabrina. Jo Carole Lauder, President Brian Urquhart, Chairman The International Council of The Museum of Modern Art, NY
