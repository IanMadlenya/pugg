        RIKER--Walter, MD. The Department of Anesthesiology of The New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical College is saddened by the loss of Walter Riker. Through his many years as Chairman of the Department of Pharmacology at the Cornell Medical College, Dr. Riker was a dear, highly respected and cherished colleague who served as an intimate liaison and mentor in the understanding of many of the fundamentals of contemporary anesthesiology. His work on the neuromuscular junction and inhalational anesthetics are a part of the foundation for our profession. Dr. Riker's scientific focus on the importance of the motor nerve terminal in the physiology and pharmacology of the neuromuscular junction was ahead of its time when he first began to publish in the 1950's and 60's. He will be remembered as a person of great warmth and sincerity and as a scientist, teacher, and humanist. Our sincere sympathy & condolences are extended to the Riker family.
