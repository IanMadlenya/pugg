With profound sorrow, the faculty, students, staff, and alumni of the New York University College of Dentistry record the passing or our beloved Professor, mentor, benefactor, and colleague, Dr. Anthony S. Mecca. A man of rare devotion to family, alma mater, community, and profession, Dr. Mecca enjoyed the distinction of having taught more oral surgery to more New York dentists than any other teacher. NYU's Dr. Anthony S. Mecca Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery recognizes his extraordinary professional contributions, loyalty, devotion and friendship. To his sister Marie and his entire family, we offer heartfelt condolences. Michael C. Alfano, DMD, PhD, Dean
