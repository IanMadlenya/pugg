        GOURARY--Paul. The members of the Council of the Grolier Club are deeply saddened by the loss of Paul Gourary, a member since 1953, councilor from 1966 to 1981, and an Honorary Member of the Grolier Club since 2001. We will sorely miss the friendship, guidance and sage advice of this extraordinary bookman, and our condolences go to his wife Marianne, his family, and his many friends in the world of books.
