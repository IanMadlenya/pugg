        STONE - FRIEDLANDER - Judy, M.D. The Partners and staff of Concord/Kips Bay Medical Group extend their deepest sympathies to our colleague and partner, Charles Friedlander, on the untimely passing of his wife. The quintessential 20th century woman, Judy Stone-Friedlander somehow managed to fit motherhood of six wonderful children and three separate, extremely successful careers into her all too short lifetime. She was a physician, loved and respected for her tenderness and sensitivity to her patients during her medical career, and equally known and respected for her financial acumen in her business career. The love of her husband and family knew no bounds. Truly a woman for all seasons.
