        CLARK -- Caroline Melanie. Lost her battle with leukemia on February 5, 2005. Beloved daughter of Angel and Nylda. Adored by sisters Camille, Catherine and Milexis, brother Alberto and family. She was a student at Utica College, an active member of Holy Trinity RC Church. God must have needed an angel because He took her away from us too soon. We will love you and miss you forever. Funeral Mass will be held February 8, 2005, 10AM, at Holy Trinity RC Church, West 82 St. between Broadway & Amsterdam Avenues.
