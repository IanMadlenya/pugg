        LOEB-Irving. We deeply mourn the passing of a distinguished friend and generous benefactor. As a trustee of the Margaret and Elizabeth Winkler Foundation, he improved the quality of care at Netanya's only hospital by donating life-safing equipment to its Departments of Cardiology and Pediatrics. Our sincerest condolences to his wife Selma and sons Robert and Donald. May you be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
