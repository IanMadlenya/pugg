        GERMAIN-Lawrence, 9th Anniversary. Precious memories, my husband Lawrence. Passed away March 24, 1991. Lord, I know you are always busy, for you have many things to do, but when sorrow overcomes me, well I need to talk to you. For I lost my husband Lawrence, he is with you up above. He is someone that I needed and someone that I loved. I would like to say so many things, I don't know where to start, I only know I miss you Lawrence from the bottom of my heart. When I'm sad and lonely and everything goes wrong, I seem to hear you whisper, cheer up and carry on. Meet me in my dreams, Lawrence. Talk to me once more. Ease this everlasting pain that makes my heart so sore. I know you walk beside me and when my life is through, I pray that God will take my hand and lead me straight to you. I'll put my arms around you and kiss your smiling face, then the pieces of my broken heart will fall back into place.
