        SHEDLIN-Allan. It is with great sorrow that the Board of Directors and staff of Easter Seals New York acknowledge the passing of one of it's most loyal and beloved friends, Allan Shedlin. An active Board member for over 25 years, Allan and his dear wife Lilli personified the mission and spirit of the organization. Allan was instrumental in launching Project HAPPY, a New York City based therapeutic recreation program that provided opportunities for children with disabilities. He was a vocal advocate and staunch supporter of increased transportation options for individuals with disabilities and enabled the launching of Symphony Transportation in New York City. Allan was passionate about the needs of students with disabilities and was a strong supporter of our educational programs. Above all, Allan was a true friend who gave endlessly of himself so that others who were less fortunate would experience a better quality of life. Allan touched our lives and made New York a better place to live for children and adults with disabilities. His absence will be felt by all of us. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his beloved wife and best friend, Lilli.
        SHEDLIN-Allan. I shall always treasure the memories of happy times shared for so many years. Jimmy Heller
