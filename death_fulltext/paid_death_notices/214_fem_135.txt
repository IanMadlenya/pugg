        CASPER -- Paula Fraser, 1906-2004, entered into rest on November 17, 2004. Paula is survived by her loving and devoted daughter Yvette and her husband John, her grandson Thomas Donegan who brought her much joy, her great-granddaughter Kathleen Donegan who filled her final years with great delight, her step son Leon Casper and wife Arlene, her nieces Liz and Karol, and her nephews Paul and Ted, her grand niece Kathy, her very dear cousin Elsie and many loving friends. Paula's entire professional writing career was in the motion picture industry with Paramount and Universal Pictures. Her work's crowning achievement was gaining acceptance of movie icon Arthur L. Mayer's lectures into the archives of the American Film Institute in Hollywood, CA. A memorial service will be held on Sunday, November 21st, 2004 at 1:30 pm at Riverside Memorial Chapel on West 76th Street and Amsterdam Ave. In lieu of flowers, contributions in Paula's memory may be made to The Karpas Hospice at Beth Israel Medical Center or the West End Day School, where Paula served as Treasurer.
        CASPER--Paula. The Board of Directors mourns the loss of our beloved Treasurer. She served the cause of education for children well these many decades. Her daughter Yvette, her step-son Leon, her grandchild Tommy, her great grandchild Katie and her loving nieces and nephews survive her. She will be sorely missed by all.
