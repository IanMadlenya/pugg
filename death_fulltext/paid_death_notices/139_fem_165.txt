        KRAUS-Sister Irene, D.C. Saint John's University expresses its profound sorrow on the passing of Sister Irene Kraus, D.C., dedicated trustee, wise counselor and cherished friend. Hers was a life of service-to her religious community, to the Daughters of Charity health care system which she so ably led, to the poor whom she so deeply loved, and to the Board of Trustees of St John's. We who were privileged to work with her have been immeasurably enriched by her faith, her insights, her generosity and grace, her integrity, and her unwavering commitment to the highest standards of excellence. We are grateful to God for giving her to us and extend our deepest sympathy to the members of her own family and to the Daughters of Charity. Donald J. Harrington, C.M., President
