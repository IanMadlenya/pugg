        LOMAX-Alan. The Hunter College Community mourns the passing of the esteemed musicologist & folklorist, Alan Lomax, who established The Association for Cultural Equity at Hunter in 1989. He also moved his vast research and archival collection of audio and video tapes, photographs, and scholarly notes to Hunter and shared his wealth of scholarly information with Hunter's faculty and student body. An inspiration to legions of folk music lovers and scholars, he will be greatly missed but his legacy will continue for generations to come. We extend our deepest condolences to his daughter, Dr. Anna Chairetakis, and family. Jennifer J. Raab, President Hunter College, CUNY
