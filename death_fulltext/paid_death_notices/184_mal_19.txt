        MONBLATT-Isidore. On April 30, 2002. W.W. II veteran and Lehman Brothers Assistant Comptroller, but he would like to be remembered most as Nancy's adoring, devoted husband of 60 years, loving father to Steve, Joan and Cathy and doting grandfather to Rebecca and Gabriela. We will always remember you with all the love in the world. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to SloanKettering Memorial Hospital.
