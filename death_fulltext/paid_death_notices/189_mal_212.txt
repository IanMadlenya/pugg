        THORNE - Edwin. The Boards, Faculty, and Staff of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, Weill Cornell Medical College, and Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons mourn the passing of Edwin Thorne. Mr. Thorne was elected a Governor of the Society of the New York Hospital in 1968, a Life Governor in 1984, and a Life Trustee of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in 1997. He continued an exemplary record of service begun by his father, Langdon Thorne, who also served on the Board of Governors. He participated fully in the activities of the Board, particularly the Investment Committee, for which he served as Chairman. The Hospital benefited from his unfailing dedication, leadership, and wisdom. We extend our deepest sympathies to his family, particularly his four sons: Brinkley, Peter, Gordon, and Edwin, Jr.
