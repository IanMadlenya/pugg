        HOCHMAN--Abraham Albert (the Boomer), 95, of Brooklyn, NY, died peacefully in his home on Wednesday night, February 7, 2007. He was born in Lublin, Poland, on April 14, 1911, and immigrated with his family to New York at age 1. After graduating from Seward Park High School, on the Lower East Side, in 1926, he attended the City College of New York, graduating at age 19 with a degree in Chemistry. He served in the US Army Quartermasters Corps as chief chemist through WWII. For many years he was a principal and president of S.S. Staffords, Inc. and retired in 1967. After his retirement, he became a private investor and was active in diverse businesses. His many charitable works include his leadership of Congregation Tifereth Torah of Bensonhurst for more than four decades, serving most of that time as its president. His wife of 54 years, Frances, his brothers Joseph and William, and sister Mona predeceased him. He is survived by his children, Carole (Lawrence Sirovich), David, Richard (Carol), and Judith (Richard Fuchs); grandchildren Brenda and Matthew Sirovich (and Meredith Elson), Nathaniel and Jason Hochman, Michael, Daniel and Benjamin Fuchs; great-grandchildren, Lucas and Eliza Sirovich; many adoring nieces and nephews; and his companion, Flo Behrstock, of Sunny Isles, FL. Our world has lost a man of intellect, wisdom, love, generosity, humor, and a strong sense of family. Services will be held at Riverside Chapel on 76th and Amsterdam on Friday, February 9, at 10am. In lieu of flowers, donations in his memory can be made to the Albert and Frances Hochman Scholarship of the City College of New York. Shiva will be observed at the Sirovich residence in Manhattan.
