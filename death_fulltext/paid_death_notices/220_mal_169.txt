        ROSENTHAL -- Robert Z., D.D.S. We mourn the loss of a man who was a quiet, sensitive person, possessing a strong inner strength. Dedicated to the care of his dental patients who loved him for his kindness and ability. He served the Queens community and many dental organizations throughout his career with dignity and integrity. His devotion to family and friends was extraordinary. He will be remembered in our hearts forever. The Samuels and Phillips Families
