        $(6$)NACHT--Carl Henry, M.D. Optimism, joy, humility, adventure, dedication, boundless energy and love: these express only a fraction of what this remarkable man was about. He is simply irreplaceable and his loss will be felt forever. We are committed to his wife, our dear friend Mary Beth Kelly, and his amazing children, Zoe and Asher, who represent the very best of him. Community of loving friends of the Kelly-Nachts
