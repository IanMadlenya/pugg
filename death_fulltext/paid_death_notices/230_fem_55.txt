        GOLD--Hilarie Beth (Imber). After a most courageous battle, has left us in her 50th year. She blessed us with her loving, caring and feisty personality. Hilarie has been a very special daughter, sister, wife, mother, niece, cousin, aunt and friend to all. She brought into our lives her wonderful/special husband, Michael and also enriched our lives with Danielle and Matthew--the two greatest and loving kids. Hilarie was truly a woman of valor and will be greatly missed by all whose lives she touched. Hilarie, I know you are going to a place filled with love and comfort--you deserve it. Rest in peace. Love you forever. Mom
