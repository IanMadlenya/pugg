        CHWATT--Edward A. On May 1, 2004. A powerful, loving, supportive and stable force in our lives was transformed by the sudden passing of our beloved husband, father, stepfather, brother, grandpa, uncle and friend. He was an adoring husband to Sara, whom he cherished. He was a fiercely devoted father to Mitchell, Sara, Jill, Eric, Nancy, Samantha and Jimm. Eddie was a loving brother and best friend to Robyn and Richard, with whom he shared an extraordinary and unbreakable bond. He delighted in spending time with his grandchildren Sammie, Justin, Corey, Nikki, Dana, Lauren, Kayla and Sierra, all of whom he adored. He loved his nieces and nephews Glenn, Lori, Suzy, Craig, Jaime and Evan. He prized his many friends with whom he shared priceless memories and strong ties. His love, energy, charisma, sense of humor and generosity touched many and as a result he enriched the world. He will continue to guide us, fill us with love and be an ongoing light in our lives. Services will be held at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, NYC, Wednesday, May 5, 2:30 p.m. Donations in his memory may be made to Congregation Schomre Israel, 18 Park Avenue, Poughkeepsie, NY 12603.
