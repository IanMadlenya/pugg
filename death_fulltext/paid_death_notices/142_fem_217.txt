        MAAYANI-Edna. Bnai Zion, the 90 year old American Zionist Fraternal Organization, mourns the passing, after a long and courageous battle against cancer, of its long time Associate National Director Edna Maayani, a valiant worker and devoted supporter of Jewish causes and the State of Israel.
