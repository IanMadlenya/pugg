        ABRAMSON--Seth F., M.D. Died October 13 from complications of surgery. He was 78. He grew up in New York City, graduating from Horace Mann School for Boys. Never one to boast about his academic achievements, Dr. Abramson had many: after serving in the Navy in World War II, he received his BA from Yale University (1948, Phi Beta Kappa) and graduated from Yale Medical School (1953) followed by residency and fellowship training as a general surgeon. He was a practicing physician up to the time of his death. He had also served as a NYPD police surgeon. Dr. Abramson is survived by his adoring wife, Andrea, who always will be grateful for his enduring love and constant encouragement through 31 years of marriage. He is also survived by his stepdaughter and her husband, Jackie and Daniel Cohen, granddaughters Emily and Caroline, brother-in-law Arthur Pava and nieces Elizabeth Pava and Susan Nusbaum. His gentle humor and affection will be greatly missed. A memorial service will be held at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue, Sunday October 17, at 1:45 PM. In lieu of flowers, please send contributions in memory of Seth F. Abramson, MD, New York University School of Medicine, 550 First Avenue, New York, New York 10016.
