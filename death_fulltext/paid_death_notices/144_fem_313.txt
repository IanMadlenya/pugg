        HORNER-Rebecca Jordan S.. It is with sorrow that we note the passing of a woman whose life spanned nearly a century. As the mother of Mrs. Thomas A. Saunders III, a devoted and well-respected member of our Board of Trustees, she is included in our prayers as a member of the hospital's extended family. Mrs. Horner, whose home was in Norfolk, VA. was a descendant of two of our nation's founding families. She was the widow of Major General Matthew Charles Horner. We extend our most sincere condolences to her family members. Saul B. Katz, Chairman Board of Trustees John S.T. Gallagher, CEO David R. Dantzker, President North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System
