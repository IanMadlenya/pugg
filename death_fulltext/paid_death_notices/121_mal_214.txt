        ILUTOVICH-Leon. The World Union of General Zionists mourns the death of one of its founding members and its Executive Director for over two decades. He was a member of the World Zionist Actions Committee for many years and at the time of his death, was one of its Honorary Members. As a disciple of Rabbi Abba Hillel Silver and Dr. Emanuel Neumann, he was extremely active in the struggle for creating the State of Israel. It was through his direction, zeal and devotion that the two projects of the ZOA: ZOA House in Tel Aviv and Kfar Silver High School near Ashkelon became the remarkable institutions they are today. We extend to his widow, Renia and all the members of his family our heartfelt condolences and deepest sympathy. Jacques Torczyner, President and Honorary President, ZOA
