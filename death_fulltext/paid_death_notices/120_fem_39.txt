        ENGEL - Barbara R. On January 5, 1997. At her home in Ft. Lauderdale, FL. Born in New York, long time resident of Mamaroneck, NY and, for the past 52 years, a devoted sailing companion to her husband Morton. A loving mother to her daughters Susan and Patsy. She lived with a zest for life and died with selfless courage. She leaves along with her husband, daughters and countless friends, her sister Florence, brother Jerome and son-in-law Arthur.
        ENGEL - Barbara. The family of Anne and Sam Eisenberg grieves with Morton, her husband, Susan Engel Eisenberg and Patsy Engel, her daughters, and her son-in-law, Arthur Eisenberg over her passing. We will remember Barbara fondly and find comfort in the memory of her quiet dignity and uncommon courage.
