        ARENSBERG-Conrad M. The members of the Department of Anthropology at Columbia University, together with their colleagues at Barnard College and Teachers College mourn the death of their teacher, colleague, and friend of many years, on February 10. His warmth of heart, world-encompassing scholarship, intergrity and defiant courage have left an indelible mark upon his friends and students, and the discipline as a whole. His life and work have been a great gift to all of us.
