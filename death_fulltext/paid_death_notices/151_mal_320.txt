        ROSENWACH-Wallace. The officers, trustees and members of Temple Emanuel of Great Neck mourn the loss of congregant Wallace Rosenwach, who served as a distinguished member of the board of trustees. He demonstrated his belief in the purposes of the synagogue through his generosity and wise counsel. A leader in his own industry and a supporter of numerous philanthropic organizations, he created a bridgehead in so many hearts through his way of dealing with situations and people. Uncomplainingly, he sought to outface personal challenge. He leaves a treasure of memories that will deepen and mellow as the years go by. We express our heartfelt sympathies to his beloved wife, Alice, to his children and grandchildren who were the light of his eyes, and to his family and friends who were always within the purview of his concern. May his memory be a benediction. Dr. Robert S. Widom, Rabbi Lloyd Goldfarb and Sandor C. Schweiger, Co-Presidents Temple Emanuel of Great Neck
