        MACDOUGALL-Rella. The Women's Committee of The Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club express their deepest sorrow in the passing of their dear friend and colleague. Rella, who joined the committee in 1973, was a guiding force to all of us. As Chairman of The Kips Bay Decorator Show House, her extraordinary dedication and commitment allowed us to raise more than eight million dollars for the children. We will miss her every day and try to follow in her magnificent footsteps.
        MACDOUGALL-Rella. To our dearest Rella who has been our fearless leader and constant source of inspiration to more than 250 grateful designers over the past 25 years of Show Houses. Your dignity, elegance, grace and quiet strength has created our success. You have profoundly touched each one of us. We will continue on while your spirit remains in our hearts and work forever.
