        TATKON-Carol Clark. Cornell University mourns the loss of a devoted alumna and Trustee, Carol Clark Tatkon, whose leadership, energy and commitment to the University was an inspiration for more than four decades. An involved undergraduate and member of the Class of '59, she went on to a distinguished career in the corporate world at a time when such achievements by women were rare. Despite the demands of her professional life, she remained deeply involved with the University. She became a member of University Council in 1975 and she served with distinction as vice-chair of the College of Arts and Sciences Advisory Council, the Johnson Graduate School of Management's Strategic Task Force, as president of the Board of Cornell Adult University, as a member of the Council's Cultural Endeavors Committee, and on the President's Council of Cornell Women. As a Cornell Trustee since 1981, she had numerous leadership roles including vice-chair, chair of the Buildings and Properties Committee, and a member of both the Executive and the Alumni Affairs and Development Committees. She had an unbounded enthusiasm and love for Cornell and she inspired all who knew her with her determination, wit, keen mind, integrity, and personal warmth. We share with her daughter, Heather, and with her family, the loss of one of Cornell's most beloved alumni. Harold Tanner, Chairman Cornell Univ. Board of Trustees Hunter R. Rawlings III, Pres. Cornell University
