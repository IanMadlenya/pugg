        GORDON-Abraham N. Passed away Thursday, August 27. Distinguished faculty member and grade advisor at RJJ Yeshiva and Eastern District High Schools, New York City. A figure of unimpeachable integrity, both ethically and religiously. Committed at one and the same time to broader academic excellence and traditional Jewish principle. Survived by his wife Ray, children Florence Wassner of Neponsit, NY, and Rabbi Dr. Martin L. Gordon of Jerusalem, Israel, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. His passing creates a profound void in all our hearts.
