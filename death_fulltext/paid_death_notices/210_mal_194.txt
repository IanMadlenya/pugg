        TURNER--Jeffrey. It is with deep sorrow that Kaye Scholer mourns the passing of its friend and colleague, Jeffrey Turner, this past weekend. Jeff possessed legal acumen at the highest level of the profession and was a vibrant part of the firm's Los Angeles office. He was a prolific author and lecturer, co-authoring the Fifth Edition of ''Asset-Based Lending: A Practical Guide to Secured Financing'', (PLI Press 2002), in addition to numerous articles and other publications of interest to commercial lawyers. He gave generously of his time and expertise, serving as the Chair and/or President of many professional committees at the national, state and local levels, including most recently as Chair of the Commercial Financial Services Committee of the American Bar Association. He was a Fellow Regent and incoming Secretary of The American College of Commercial Finance Lawyers; past President of the Financial Lawyers Conference; past Chair of the California State Bar Business Law Section of the Council of Section Chairs; and past Chair of the Commercial Law and Bankruptsy Section of the Los Angeles County Bar Association. He received his J.D. from Duke University School of Law, where he was on the Editorial Board of the Duke Law Journal, and his B.A. from the University of Kentucky. We extend our deepest condolences to Jeff's wonderful family.
