        LAPPE--Marc. The Board of Trustees, staff and volunteers of the March of Dimes sadly note the loss of Dr. Marc Lappe (1943-2005), a remarkable bioethicist and environmentalist, whose long, productive career ended too soon. Marc energetically worked for social justice in health, especially for vulnerable populations of women and children. He served on the March of Dimes National Bioethics Committee since its inception in 1975. Marc's dedication to our mission to save babies from birth defects and premature birth will be greatly missed. We send condolences to his family, to CETOS, and to his large network of colleagues.
