        JESS--Died the beginning of the year at his home in San Francisco. His friend and dealer for over 40 years, Odyssia Skouras, her family and the staff of the Odyssia Gallery mourn his passing. There will be no services at this time, however, Harry Parker, the director of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, has offered to have a memorial service at its new DeYoung Museum later in the spring. The DeYoung Museum has the most comprehensive collection of the artist's work chosen over many years. In lieu of flowers, please send contributions in Jess's name to the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco (DeYoung Museum), Lincoln Park, San Francisco, CA.
