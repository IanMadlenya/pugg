His brilliance and inspiration in recognition of the utility of long acting methadone to regularize the narcotic status of opiate addicts led to profound behavioral improvements, unlikely if left to standard treatment. Health improved and lives were saved. The ''metabolic disorder'' as he called it, was later revealed as a disturbance in narcotic receptors in the brain. It stimulated the discovery of endogenous narcotics and the reward system as the neuroscience of narcotics unfolded. Most then believed narcotic addiction was principally a psychological problem, best managed by detoxification and not by a substitute, no matter how effective in the short run. Calling upon his usual courtesy, Vince constantly had to fend off adverse even hostile criticism. It was a privilege to work with him in the early days of methadone treatment. Paul Cushman, Jr. MD
        $(6$)DOLE--Vincent P. The staff and patients of the Vincent P. Dole Clinic in Brooklyn, a unit of the Beth Israel Medical Center Methadone Maintenance Treatment Program, mourn the death of a man whose great scientific knowledge and skill were complimented by his compassion and concern for those in desperate need of help. We are enormously proud that Dr. Dole permitted us, some three years ago, to name our clinic in his honor.
