        PRINZ-Nancy. John Wiley & Sons stands out as an extraordinary caring company that kept its faith with Nancy during seven years of illness. It wasn't merely securing the job she loved despite frequent absences for treatment, but giving her support and hope. The company and her loving colleagues extended their hands and their hearts in a manner that sets a standard for corporate responsibility and decency. It's something of which all should take note and which her family will never forget.
