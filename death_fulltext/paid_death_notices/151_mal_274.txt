        SHADEK-Arthur J. Franklin & Marshall College mourns the loss of its Trustee Emeritus, former Board Vice Chair, and Honorary Alumnus. Mr. Shadek, husband of Katherine Flint Shadek, and father of F&M Trustee Laurence A. Shadek, Class of 1972, and Katherine Shadek Boyle, Class of 1981, greatly advanced the College through his leadership and the generosity of his family. Franklin & Marshall shares in his family's sense of loss, but we are comforted by knowing that his legacy will endure at the College and among others whose lives he touched.
