        WRENN--M. Patricia, on August 28. Patricia lost her courageous battle with cancer at age 69. She will be deeply missed by her friends and neighbors, particularly those at 221 E. 78th St., and by her new friends at the Mary Manning Walsh Home where her spunky spirit and candid charm delighted and touched the hearts of so many, especially Bill. An alumna of Western High School in Washington, D.C. Pat came to New York in 1957. She was an active volunteer with the Central Park Conservancy and a founding member of the 200 Block East 78th St. Association which will hold a tree planting memorial for her this fall. Rest in Peace, dear Pat, know that you have brought joy to many.
