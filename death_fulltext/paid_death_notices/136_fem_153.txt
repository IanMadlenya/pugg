        SACKS-Shirley Audrey. With her family at her bedside, she died at home, at peace, on Sunday, May 24, 1998, after a valiant struggle with cancer. Her partner and companion of 43 years, Dr. Leonard S. Sacks; her children Leo, Joanne and David; her brother Arthur; and her grandchildren Mira, Rachel, Julia, Shana and Moses, are drawing comfort from a lifetime of beautiful memories. Born in Yonkers, N.Y., Shirley and Leonard enjoyed a wonderful life on Manhattan's West Side. A graduate of Barnard College, Shirley was deeply committed to the education of humankind. She received her Ed.D. in Health Education from Teachers College at Columbia University, at the remarkable age of 65. The National Council on Women's Health was close to her heart; Shirley was a passionate Board member and her peers have established a lecture series in her name and honor, with a generous endowment from Pfizer, where Shirley spent twenty-five years as Senior Medical Writer. Her kindness and compassion; her sensitivity, grace and dignity; her radiant smile; and, most of all, her unconditional love, made the world a better place. Contributions can be made to the National Council on Women's Health, 1300 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021. A memorial service will be held Tuesday, June 16, at 12 PM, West Side Institutional Synagogue, 120 West 76 Street, New York.
        SACKS-Shirley. For our 59 years of shared love and laughter, thank you, dear friend. Amy
