        GOULD--Byrdie. Byrdie was the rare person who looked for beauty and goodness in everything she surveyed. She felt very blessed and adored her cherished husband, Stuart, her children, Fred and Helaine and Jay and Luetta, and her grandchildren and great grandchildren. She expressed her happiness and keen sense of humor through the whimsical poems she wrote and loved to read aloud on special occasions. Her kindness and concern for others is attested to by the devotion to charitable courses she and Stuart passed on to their sons and grandchildren. Byrdie and her family have been part of our family for more than 50 years. We extend our sincere sympathy to all the Goulds and pray that they will find consolation in her long, well-lived life.
