        HALL-Mae. The board, staff, clients and many friends of Seniors Helping Seniors deeply mourn the passing of our President and Guiding Light, Mae Hall. Mrs. Hall, one of our founders, dedicated her retirement years to making the lives of older people easier and more comfortable. A strong woman of deep convictions and long experience, Mae Hall has left a beautiful legacy in Northern Manhattan, where she lived and worked for older people. We who loved her at Seniors Helping Seniors will treasure our memories of this great lady for the rest of our lives.
