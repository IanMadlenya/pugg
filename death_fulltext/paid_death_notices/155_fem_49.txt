        AULT-Allie Burchenal The officers, directors and staff of the Episcopal Church Foundation express their deep sadness at the death of Allie Burchenal Ault. Mrs. Ault was a member of the Foundation's Board since 1973, representing an extension of a family commitment since the Foundation's inception. She served with distinction and generosity of spirit, with special contributions to the Foundation's educational work. We join the family's many friends in expressing our condolences.
