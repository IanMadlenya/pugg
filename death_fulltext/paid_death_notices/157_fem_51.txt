        CASHIN-Bonnie. The Fashion Institute of Technology acknowledges with sadness the death of Bonnie Cashin, innovative designer of simple but elegant clothes for the modern woman. With Ms. Cashin, the Museum at FIT has been planning a major retrospective of her work for exhibition in September. Although she will not be able to receive the acclaim she so deserves, Bonnie had put her mark on the show, and will be there in spirit.
