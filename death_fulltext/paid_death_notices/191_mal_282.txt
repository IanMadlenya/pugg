        LUCAIRE-L. Edward. On December 26, 2002, after a valiant battle with leukemia. Beloved husband of Lewise, cherished father of Laurin and Eddie and devoted friend to many. A U.S. Army veteran and graduate of Amherst College, Ed applied his creative talents in advertising before realizing his true calling as an author. He had an insatiable curiosity, a sparkling wit, and an engaging personality. He amazed us with his courage and we will miss him immensely. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made in his memory to the New York Public Library or the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.
