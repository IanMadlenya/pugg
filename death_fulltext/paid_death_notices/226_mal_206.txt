        $(6$)SHAPIRO--Murray. It is with great sadness that the Office of James Ruderman mourns the loss of Murray Shapiro, a pre-eminent structural engineer of high-rise office buildings and retired principal of the firm. He died on November 14 in NYC at the age of 80. Mr. Shapiro began his 46 year association with OJR in 1950. Examples of his accomplishments include the Pan Am Building (Met Life), GM Building, Citicorp, 1 Penn Plaza, 55 Water St and 1675 Broadway. We at OJR extend our deepest sympathies and heartfelt respect to the Shapiro family. He will be missed.
