        DENTON--David. His friends and colleagues who served with him in the office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 1980-1983 mourn the death of an outstanding lawyer and public servant. He was a cherished friend and we will miss him. Our prayers and thoughts go out to his beloved wife Reena and his son David. The John S. Martin Association
