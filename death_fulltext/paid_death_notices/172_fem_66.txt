        NATIVIDADE-Nurimar. To ''Nury,'' beautiful woman who left us too soon. She was only 48 years old. Planning to go back to the love of her life, she died of cancer on April 30, 2001, at 3 AM. My memories, my love, my heart. Truly your friend, sister and caretaker. Goodbye, angel. Your sister, Patty
