        O'DWYER-Paul. What a privilege to have been at your side. You showed us the righteousness and joy of a life spent in the passionate pursuit of freedom, justice, equality, peace and the dignity of man. You brought Thomas Paine's ''Common Sense'' to life in Mayo, the North, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Hattiesburg, Harrisburg and New York. Your legacy continues to multiply with each new generation inspired by your enduring advocacy, commitment and leadership. Paul Nussbaum
        O'DWYER-Paul. Paul O'Dwyer's interest in the history of the City of New York & his deep commitment to the preservation of archival source materials has encouraged and strengthened us. The New York Irish History Roundtable notes with sadness the passing of a unique friend, and extends deepest sympathy to his family.
        O'DWYER-Paul. This fine son of Mayo moved our nation to justice. John F. Wade Kennebunk, Maine
