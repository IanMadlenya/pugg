The President, Chancellor, Boards of Govenors and Overseers, Faculty, Administration and Students of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, records with profound sorrow the passing of Celia Atlas, beloved widow of Professor Samuel Atlas, revered teacher of generations of rabbis. Celia Atlas was an exemplar of grace and elegance and brought deeper meaning to the phase, ''aishet hayil''. We shall not see her kind again. Our heartfelt sympathy is extended to her beloved family.
