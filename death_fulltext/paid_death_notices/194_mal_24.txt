        STOCK-Julius. Beloved husband and dearest friend of Sylvia (Shanker) died on February 23, 2003. A graduate of Penn State, he had degrees in Metallurgy and Ceramics. He worked on the X-15 and the space shuttle. His children Elizabeth (David Wechsler) and William (Rhonda Gura) and grandchildren David and Benjamin will always remember him with unending love in their hearts. A wonderful man has left us.
