        SOSIS-Muriel A. (nee Addis). A resident of the Bronx, on January 21, 2002 at age 86. A wonderfully giving and caring mother, grandmother, sister and friend. She was a gem. She cared deeply about her family and her fellow man. She loved classical music, reading, and collecting old jewelry. Her goodness and kindness will be deeply missed, but her spirit will live on in those who were lucky enough to have known her. She is survived by her son Richard, daughter-in-law Judith, grandchildren Karin, Andrew and Leah, and her brother and sisterin-law, Arthur and Joy Addis.
