        GOLDSTEIN-Belle. AMIT is deeply grieved by the passing of our most beloved Honorary President and activist in the creation of the State of Israel and a pioneer in the development of religious Zionism. Belle Goldstein was an early leader of Mizrachi Women, and its third National President. She guided, counseled and mentored the organization and its volunteers as it grew and evolved into AMIT, the world's leading supporter of religious Zionist education and social services for needy Israeli youths. Belle played an ongoing leadership role in AMIT's uneaqualled history of ''saving the forgotten children of Israel.'' At the age of 102, Belle Goldstein realized the Zionist dream in making Aliyah to Israel, where she continued her Jewish communal activities. A true ''Woman of Valor'', Belle Goldstein possessed such charm, grace, warmth and oratory skill, that she mesmerized her audiences and moved them to a deeper love for Torah Israel, and religious Zionism. She held the ideals of Zionism and her passion for Klal Yisrael close to her heart. We express our very sincere condolences to her entire family. May they comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Sondra Sokal, President Marvin Leff, Executive Director
