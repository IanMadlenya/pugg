        VIDOCKLER-Murray. At the funeral service for Murray in Florida on January 31, we, the brothers Arthur and Bernard, and the sister Gertrude Toby, expressed to all their gratitude for his life. We spoke of the pain at the loss. The service led by Murray's wife and children filled the chapel with the friends, relatives, and family who live in Florida. We are deeply appreciative for their support, sympathy and sentiments. Shiva is being observed in West Palm Beach.
