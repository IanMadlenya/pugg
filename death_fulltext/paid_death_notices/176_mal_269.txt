        SPENCER - William I. The Trustees, faculty and staff of The Colorado College mourn the passing of 1939 alumnus William I. Spencer, a CC trustee since 1967 and chair of the board from 1984 to 1991. The retired president of Citicorp Citibank, Mr. Spencer was also a generous supporter of the college. The William I. Spencer Citicorp Scholarship Fund, established by Citicorp in honor of his retirement, provides CC students with financial aid based on athletic and academic merit. Mr. Spencer was awarded an honorary degree from CC in 1994. A tremendous student-athlete, he was the co-captain of CC's first intercollegiate hockey team in 1938. He recently served as Honorary Chair of the CC Athletic Hall of Fame. On behalf of The Colorado College community, we extend our sympathy and appreciation to members of the Spencer family. William R. Ward, Chair of The Colorado College Board of Trustees Kathryn Mohrman, President of Colorado College
