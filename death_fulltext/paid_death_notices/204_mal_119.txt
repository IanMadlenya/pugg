        MILGROM--Rabbi Louis. The Rabbinical Assembly mourns with profound sorrow the passing of our beloved colleague who served at The University of Minnesota for 27 years after which he became the Chair of Jewish Studies at The University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. We extend our deepest condolences to his family and to all who were touched through his rabbinate.
