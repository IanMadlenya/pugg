        JORDEN-Deanna. It was with great sadness that our office learned of the passing of one of the most compassionate people. Deanna was a woman who never questioned the work her boards and owners requested of her and did it with great pride and joy. It is a rare pleasure when an employer can count on such dedication from an employee. Deanna planned to be with our family for the long haul, giving 110% of herself to the job, the people she worked for and mostly the people she worked with. A listing of names of the persons who will miss this sweet soul would span this entire paper, from her tenants to her superintendents to her contractors...from Norman Buchbinder & Eugene Warren to all of her co-workers and their families. An empty desk sits looking out at Union Square today. A desk that has been filled with thirteen years of wonderful memories from a wonderful person. We love you and we'll miss you forever. All of us at Buchbinder & Warren
