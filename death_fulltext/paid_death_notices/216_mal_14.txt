        GLASER -- Miles Rudolph. Died peacefully on December 24, 2004 at M.D. Anderson Hospital after a courageous battle with cancer. Born in Prague, Czechoslovakia on May 2, 1925 he was the son of Dr. Oskar and Marketa Glaser, both of whom perished in the concentration camps. Miles survived three brutal years in the camps and upon being liberated in May 1945 returned to Prague. When the Communists came to power in 1948, he was smuggled across the border into Austria and resided in Vienna before immigrating to the United States in 1949. Miles held various jobs in Chicago and New York City before moving to Houston in 1954 as the representative of a foreign owned steel exporter. He became an American citizen in 1955, and for the next twenty years continued as an executive in the steel business, eventually becoming the owner of Global Steel. It was during this time that he met John de Menil and his wife Dominique, from which grew a life long friendship. He was invited to become a member of the Menil Foundation Board and served as the Chief Financial Officer of the Menil Foundation until his retirement in the late 1990s. He remains the Emeritus member of the board. Miles is survived by his wife, Slavka, to whom he was married for ten years. She and his friends will remember him as an extraordinary man, filled with a passion for life and an unwavering belief in the rights of each individual. He suffered no fools and defended fiercely the principles of loyalty, ethics, and freedom. He did not bend to the particular winds of the day, but steered his own course with humor and wisdom. Those who knew Miles will never forget him; he touched us all. By his own wishes he will be privately cremated. If desired, donations may be sent to the charity of your choice.
