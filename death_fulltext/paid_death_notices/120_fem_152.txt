        BERKSTEIN-Rose. Bar-Ilan University in Israel and its American Friends extend sincerest condolences to Mrs. Judith Haimoff, Director of Global Development at Bar-Ilan University in Israel, her sister and the entire family on the loss of their mother, Mrs. Rose Berkstein. Both of them may derive a measure of solace not only from the fact that they were exemplary daughters, but also from the fact that they afforded their mother great nachat from their respective careers. To Bar-Ilan University, the leadership of Mrs. Haimoff has been most noteworthy and we are in her debt forever. Rabbi Emanuel Rackman, Chancellor Yehuda Halevy, Exec. V.P. Jane Stern Lebell, Pres., American Friends of Bar-Ilan University
