        ADAM-Capt. Yaacov Kubek (1922 -2002). On Monday, January 7, peacefully at Roosevelt Hospital following a brief illness. Capt. Adam was a Master Mariner, intrepid sailor and decorated war veteran. He was born in Busk, Poland, and was a young immigrant to Palestine where he joined the Haganah in 1938. Following his graduation from Israel's Officers Academy in Haifa, he saw active service with the allied navies during World War II, earning a testimonial message from Pres.

Adam -he was Commanding Officer of the first warship in Israel's navy during the 1948 War of Independence. Capt. Adam was an active member of The Explorers Club, in support of education in scientific exploration for young people and laypersons, and was North American Director of Operation Drake, under the patronage of H.R.H. Prince Charles. He was predeceased by his late sister, Ernestina, and is survived by his brothers Lonek and Y'Israel; his daughter, Judith Adam, & grandsons Brendan and Arden; his niece, Zmira Adam Shuruk; his nephew, David Ronen; his dear former wife, Nina Reitzman Adam; and many sincere and genuine friends.
