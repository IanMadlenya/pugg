        ROSENBERRY-Cecily. The Board of Directors and Staff of the Visiting Nurse Service of New York deeply mourn the loss of Cecily Rosenberry, a life-long volunteer and Director for more than 50 years. She began her association with the agency in 1944 and was a great champion of public health and home care nursing. Her unwavering support and generosity in responding to the health care needs of the NY community will be remembered always. We extend our profound sympathy to her daughter, Nancy, and to her grandchildren. Douglas D. Broadwater Chairman of the Board Carol Raphael Pres. and Chief Exec Officer
