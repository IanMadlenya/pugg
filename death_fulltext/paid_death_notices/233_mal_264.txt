        GORELL--Frank. The family of The Curtis Institute of Music mourns the loss of its devoted friend Frank Gorell and extends deepest sympathy to his family. A recipient of Curtis's Alumni Award, he shared his profound commitment to young musicians through projects such as the young artists' series at the Raymond F. Kravis Center in West Palm Beach, FL. He also served Curtis as an overseer and a trustee. His pride in his musical training and his unwavering dedication will long inspire us. Roberto Diaz, President H.F.
