        ORELL--Rose. The Board of Directors and Staff of the Samuel Field/Bay Terrace YM & YWHA mourn the loss of our esteemed Board Member, Rose Orell. Rose was a compassionately committed advocate for all those in need and worked tirelessly to maintain the dignity and enrich the lives of all human beings. After being one of the original founders of our Agency, she served as a vital and vibrant Board Member for over 40 years, and received many well-deserved honors and awards for her extraordinary achievements. Her courage, wisdom and love of life served as an inspiration for all those who knew her. We will profoundly miss her loving presence, strength and generous spirit. We extend our heartfelt condolences to her daughter and son, Audrey and Sandy, her five grandchildren and greatgrandchild. Michael Bizenov, President Steven Goodman, Exec. VP
