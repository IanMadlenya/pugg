        WEINBERG--Charles. We will miss our caring and gentle friend. In our memories we will hear his Noel Coward and Gilbert and Sullivan, and see him happily swimming. He was our scholar, our literature, art and music maven. He is now at peace. Our hearts go out to Dorothy, Liz and Nancy at this difficult time. Edwina and Marvin Elyse and Bonnie >>AD#
