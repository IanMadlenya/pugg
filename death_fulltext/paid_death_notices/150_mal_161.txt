        SHERLOCK-William. It was our privilege and great pleasure to have enjoyed the friendship of Bill Sherlock and his beloved family. We admired and loved his style, humor, generosity and gentle demeanor. Our deepest sympathy to Sissy, Billy and Robert. Rest in peace, Bill, you will be missed. Pete, Connie and Jeff Mogull
