        WHITE--Marjorie Powers. 79, of NYC, at Heron Island, ME, died August 8th, 2004. Married to Willard D. White Jr., mother of Shawn, Stephen, Catherine and Nicholas White, and grandmother of Zoe Frederick and Nicholas Jr., Katie and Patrick White. She was the daughter of Frank T. Powers Sr. and Mary D. Powers of Glen Cove, NY. She was an enthusiastic alumna of Sarah Lawrence College. Later she attended the Art Students League of NY and the Academy of Fine Arts in Florence, Italy. Though a life long artist and writer, she was shy about publishing. She was a great admirer of light-moon, stars, Christmas and sunsets. Travel, the subject matter of many of her poems, prints and photographs, found its seeds in her early association with the Experiment in International Living. She said she would get another cat in a minute, go to Mexico in a minute, but she did not want to go to Australia unless Willard did--then she would go in a minute. Her love of books and libraries was voluminous. Memorial donations may be made to NY Public Library, Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street, Room 73, NY, NY 10018. There will be no services.
