        PAPP--Steven M. The Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene mourns the loss of our friend and colleague Steven M. Papp. Steven was Deputy Director for Administration at the New York Psychiatric Institute, a member of the Board of Directors of the Research Foundation and Chairman of the Fiscal Committee. For many years the Research Foundation has had the tremendous fortune of his wise counsel and leadership. He was respected for his superior intellect, sense of humor and superior management style. He was a leader with understanding and deep concern that allowed him to help others in a constructive, unselfish manner. He had only friends and no enemies among the scientists and administrators who had the honor and pleasure of working with him. He will be missed by the scientific community as well as his fellow administrators. We extend our sympathies to Steven's family and co-workers as they have lost an exceptional individual. His memories will live on with all of us at the Research Foundation. Abel Lajtha, PhD, President Robert E. Burke, Managing Director Frank L. Mucha Deputy Director for Admin.
