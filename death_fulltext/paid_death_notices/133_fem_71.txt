        SWANN-Christine S. (formerly Christine Downey). Mother, daughter, sister, aunt, grandmother, friend, lover, woman. On Feb. 4, 1998 surrounded by her family, Christine Swann left this life for parts unknown. During her two bouts with lymphoma, the second of which she lost, she remained a spirited and loving fan of life. Sweetly stubborn, she lost her hair, her mobility, her energy, and her ability to speak easily, but not her sense of humor or wonder or her desire to understand. Christine shined in ways that this world does'nt recognize with degrees, professional titles, executive salaries, medals or other tokens of acknowledgment. She loved generously. She smiled splendiferously. She welcomed any and all. Those of us who had the privilege of knowing and loving her understand that we are blessed. Her natural and hard won wisdom, her glee, and her accepting, forgiving ways made life more beautiful and livable for the many of us who at one time or another gathered around her light, and found ourselves dancing. She will forever life in the hearts of her friends and family; her children, Jennifer, Rebecca, Christina, Nell and Jim; and her grandson Finn. A memorial service will be held on Saturday, February 14th, at 1 P.M., at the First Church of Round Hill in Greenwich, CT. In lieu of flowers, contributions may go to the Lymphoma Research Foundation of America, 8800 Venice Blvd., Suite 207, Los Angeles, CA. 90034.
        SWANN-Christine S. Elaborate, delicate power of the honeyed mother. Gift of worship, love and spring. Woman of the wind. Girl of the moon. Her glorious love by the sea. Chanting in the garden. You are me. My friend always, Lindy.
