        FRIED-Ruth. Age 69. Of Remsenburg, N.Y. and Boca Raton, FL. On November 11, 1999. In this limited space and at this time, it is impossible to adequately convey our warmth and love for Ruth. Our mother and wife was so many things: a businesswoman; a writer; a political activist; a loving spouce and parent. Ruthie was smart, outspoken and consistently exceptional. No one who met her ever forgot her. Ruth inspired and challenged us to excel in the world, and will continue to do so forever. A rare person, she will truly be missed. The loves of Ruthie's life include daughters Debra and Jacqueline and son Andrew, with devoted husband Alfred atop the list. Six loving grandchildren (Rachel; Alex; Orly; Benjamin; Ethan; Erel), aunt Florence Rogol and brother Eugene Zuch also survive. Services shall be held at Gutterman's Chapel, Boca Raton, FL. at 11AM Sunday, November 14. Memorial contributions may be made to the Washington Institute for Jewish Leadership and Values, 6101 Montrose Road, Rockville, MD. 20852. Telephone 301-770-5070.
