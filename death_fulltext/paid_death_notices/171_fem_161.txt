        SCHLUSSEL - Barbara. Adored wife of Sy Schlussel, M.D. for 49 years. Mother of her beloved son Ralph and sister of Herbert Simon. Passed away April 15. She was genuinely the most devoted loving mother, always selflessly willing to sacrifice and forego personal rewards in caring for her Ralph. For many years she raised funds for the Mental Retardation Facility at the New York Medical College and for more than 30 years arranged the pre-graduation dinner dance for the New York Medical College. She will be sorely missed but never forgotten. Friends may call at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81 Street, Tuesday and Wednesday 7-9PM with services Thursday 11:30AM. Interment private.
        SCHLUSSEL-Barbara. We note with sadness the passing of Barbara Schlussel, a very good friend of many years & a wonderful person. We will miss her. Our sympathy goes to Sy, Ralph and Herb. Alec and Mila Sedlis
