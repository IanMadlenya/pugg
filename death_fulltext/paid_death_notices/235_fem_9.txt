        GUGGENHEIMER--Joan. A client, a role model, a mentor, and most indelibly, a friend. For more then a decade, Joan inspired me with her brilliance and taught me lessons I will draw upon forever. Like so many she touched, I cannot adequately thank Joan for sharing her generous spirit and her unique perspective on life. Joan was one of a kind. I will miss her terribly. My deepest sympathy to Peter, Laura, and Eric. Brad Karp $(6$)GUGGENHEIMER--Joan. The partners, associates and staff of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP deeply mourn the passing of Joan Guggenheimer. Former general counsel of Citigroup and general counsel of JP Morgan, Joan was a longstanding friend of our firm. She was a brilliant lawyer with uncommon vision. She was a role model and mentor. But most of all, Joan was a true and generous friend, who taught us all by her example. We are all diminished by her passing. We extend our deepest sympathy to Joan's husband, Peter, and their wonderful children, Laura and Eric.
