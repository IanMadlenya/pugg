        STEINBERG-Al. With great sorrow we mourn the loss of our beloved leader, Al Steinberg, and wish to express our deepest sympathies to the entire Steinberg family. His guidance and leadership for 50 of our 80 years has left its mark on us all. His loving way not only blessed us but our spouses, children, and families as well. Thanks to him we have all had the opportunity to better ourselves and we're forever grateful. Big Al, you were one of a kind and we will continue to work every day with all we have to carry on your loving, trusting, loyal ways. You were more than a great employer, you were a great friend and someone that we knew we could always count on. You always brought light to our darkest moments. May you go in peace with all our love. The Employees of Acker and Jablow Textiles
