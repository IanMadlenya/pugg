        MANHEIMER--Marvin died October 4th, 2006 after a long illness. We mourn the passing of an unusual and vibrant man, who gave so much to his family and acquaintances throughout his life. He had a very long career in the financial business but was also a successful restaurant owner, and was an innovator in both endeavors. All will agree he was one of a kind with a generous heart and kind deeds. He will be greatly missed by his friends and family, son Robert Manheimer, daughter -in-law Cecile Manheimer, daughter Susan Rappaport, grandchildren Jason and Max Rappaport, brother Alan Manheimer. Our hearts go out to them in their grief. Services at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street, Manhattan at 12:45pm, October 6th.
