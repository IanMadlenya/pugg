        SHAYS -- Henry ''Charlie''. Loved by his wife Rona, five children, seven grandchildren, and sister, Charlie Shays died March 13, 2006 in Sarasota, FL. A son of immigrants and CCNY and Yale Law School graduate, Charlie will be remembered as a man who loved his family, friends, and his dog, Max. He held infinite information and a huge intellect with an unsurpassed wit. Passionate about lawyering, Judaism and collecting, Charlie was a fiercely moral man who lived what he taught. A beloved curmudgeon, he had a great run. In lieu of flowers please make contributions to Doctors Without Borders or the charity of your choice. Burial Friday, March 17, 11 AM at Mt. Ararat Cemetery on L.I. Shiva will be observed at the Berlsteins, 870 UN Plaza, March 17, 2-5, March 18, 6-9 PM.
