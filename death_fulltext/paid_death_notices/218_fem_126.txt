        NASH -- Hortense. 83. On March 9, 2005. Devoted sister of Phyllis Sporn and the late Edgar Nash. Horty, as she was known to family and friends, graduated from Hunter College, worked for many years as a Senior Administrative Assistant for the Emil Mogul Advertising Agency and its successors, and then was Administrative Assistant for the English Department of York College. Her zest for life, sense of humor, intellect and ability to brighten the day of family, friends, and new acquaintances alike, will be greatly missed. In addition to her sister Phyllis, she is survived by her nephews Jonathan and Seth Sporn, their spouses Jane Comerford and Denise Sporn, her nieces Jacquie Schachter and Marcy Perkus, their spouses Marc Schachter and Don Perkus, and by Eric and Scott Sporn, Matthew and Jordan Sporn, Jesse, Alexa, Zoie, and Luke Schachter, and Elizabeth and Alison Perkus. She gave the gift of the same unconditional love to her great-nieces and great-nephews that she gave to their parents, and with the same youthful spirit.
