        NAPOLITANO - Mary Eli zabeth. 55, critically acclaimed oil painter, died suddenly in her Upper West Side apartment on August 30, 2002. She graduated from Jersey City State College, summa cum laude, and earned a Masters of Fine Arts degree at City College, NYC. She traveled extensively, and in her junior year abroad in Copehagen, she was selected to debate world affairs in Moscow. Her work was shown frequently at NYC and regional galleries and museums, and she was awarded painting fellowships at several institutions, amongst them ''Yaddo'' in Saratoga Spring's, NY, the ''D.H. Lawrence Ranch'' in Taos, NM and the ''Villa Schifanoia'' in Florence, Italy. Her work was also periodically published and reviewed. She served as Artist in Residence at Stetson University in Florida. Mary lived every day with passion and embraced every challenge with determination and courage; she painted continually and prolifically throughout her life. She is survived by her eternally devoted and loving husband Thomas N. Frankel, loving mother Grace Dwyer, loving sisters Helen Schutz and Linda Schab, nieces Anna and Julia Schutz, and Lydia Hruska, nephews Kyle and Lucas Schab. Mary was an extraordinarily beautiful woman, with an equally beautiful generosity and gentleness of spirit that will remain forever in the hearts and minds of those that knew and loved her and were gratefully loved by her. A memorial service will be held at ''The Riverside Memorial Chapel'' at 2pm., Wednesday, September 4th.
