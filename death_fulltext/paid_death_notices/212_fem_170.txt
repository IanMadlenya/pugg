        ROSKIN--Susan LeVant, died September 21, 2004. With enduring love and affection we bid a fond adieu to Susan LeVant Roskin. No words can ever express how much she will be missed. Susan lived a full life with courage and dignity. She devoted herself to helping others as a professional guidance counselor, loving mother, sister, aunt and friend. No greater tribute can be paid to a life well lived and love well shared than the warm loving feelings and beautiful memories she has left with us. We wish her the much eluded peace she sought in her life. Her loving spirit will remain with us. Susan is survived by her loving son, Robert Roskin, sister Pat Spranger, brother Howard LeVant, sister-in-law Nancy LeVant and friend and former husband Bill Roskin. Funeral services will be at Riverside Memorial, W. 76 St. at Amsterdam Ave., Friday, September 24, 11:30 AM. Send donations to the American Diabetes Association.
