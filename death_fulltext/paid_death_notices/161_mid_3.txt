        NICASTRO-Ilva C. On February 6, 2000, Ilva Patrizi Corsalini Nicastro passed peacefully from this life in Philadelphia, PA. Now our beloved mother reposes with God and his angels in Paradise. Today, June 5, 2000 would have marked the 90th year of her life. To honor this occasion a private memorial mass will be celebrated to pay tribute to our loving mother, a most remarkable person. The vision of your loving memory lives on in our daily life. We love you dearest one, with all our hearts! Your sons, Anthony J.F.J. Nicastro Norman J. Nicastro, M.D
