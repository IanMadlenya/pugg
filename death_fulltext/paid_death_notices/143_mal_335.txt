        ELBIRT-Jacob. The Federation of Wolynian Jews in USA mourns with profound sorrow the passing of our beloved, longtime President. His spirited determination to perpetuate the memory of the Eastern European Jews killed during WW II was instrumental in building the Heichal Yehadut Wolyn-Yad Vashem in Israel which will serve as a place of learning about the Holocaust for generations to come. He was a passionate supporter of the State of Israel and the UJA. Jack was a member of the Prime Minister's Club in Israel and was an inspiration to all of us. His wisdom, leadership and friendship will be sorely missed. We extend our heartfelt condolences to the bereaved Elbirt family. Committee of the Federation of Wolynian Jews in USA
