        WALTER-Nelly. Columbia Artists Management Inc. was deeply saddened by the loss of our longtime friend and colleague, Nelly Walter, on October 25, 2001. Miss Walter joined CAMI in June of 1946, only a few days after she had escaped from war-torn Europe and arrived in New York. Her extensive background and experience in classical music made her an enormous asset to the company, and in 1963 she became a vice president. During her fifty-two-year tenure here, Nelly Walter helped to build the careers of such artists as Leonard Bernstein, Renata Tebaldi, Cesare Siepi, Mirella Freni, Teresa Berganza, Giulietta Simionato, Irmgard Seefried, Montserrat Caballe, Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo, Leontyne Price, and many others. Despite her stature and success in the music business, she remained intensely private and always maintained that her job was to keep the spotlight on her artists. She worked harder and kept longer hours than many of her coworkers who were decades younger. When she retired in May of 1998, she was ninety-seven years old. She celebrated her 100th birthday this past January. Nelly Walter set an example of professional excellence and personal integrity for all of us who knew her. Her death is an enormous loss to her friends, her artists, and to the music industry. Ronald A. Wilford, Chairman and CEO, and The Board of Directors of Columbia Artists Management Inc
