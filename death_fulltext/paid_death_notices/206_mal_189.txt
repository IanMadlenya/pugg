        KOSH--Oscar. Beloved husband of Leona, father of Ruth Varaiya of Berkeley, CA and Diana Lieb Sands of West Orange, NJ, grandfather of Daniel Lieb and step-grandfather of Sandy and David Lieb, he died peacefully on March 12th at age 88. A long-time resident of New Jersey and Florida, a loyal CCNY alumnus and co-founder of Case Paper Co., Oscar had a long and distinguished record of involvement in Jewish and humanitarian endeavors. A past Chairman of the Federation of Jewish Charities of the New York Graphic Arts Industry, he was an active supporter of the Israel Bond campaign in the Oranges, a prime mover of what has become the Jewish Community Center of Metrowest New Jersey, and an officer and trustee of Temple Israel of the Oranges and Maplewood. After moving to Florida, he became a leading supporter of Jewish education for children. He was also an active Board member of Israel Cancer Association-USA. He gave generously of himself to all in need, and he was an inspiration to his many admirers. A devoted friend and loving uncle, he will be sorely missed. Funeral services at 11:00 a.m. Tuesday, March 16th at Riverside-Gordon, 7205 W. Atlantic Ave., Delray Beach, FL. Send remembrances to your favorite charity.
