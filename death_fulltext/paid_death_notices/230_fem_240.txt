        BERNSTEIN--Ruth. July 14, 1909-March 29, 2006. Passed away peacefully at 96 years young with a lively spirit, the sharpest of minds, and a gentle wit until her last moments. Known as ''Aunt'' Ruth by so many, she truly enjoyed life to its fullest-with a rare spark that lit up the room and the hearts of all who knew her. Always exuding elegance, warmth and generosity, Ruth was a dedicated volunteer reader for The Jewish Guild for the Blind for over 50 years. Wife of the late Bernie Bernstein, and a devoted rock in the Brill family, she will be loved and missed by her nieces, nephews and their families: Ed Brill, Micki Levin and Michael Brill of NY; Ellen, Martin and Bonnie Brill of CA; Jeff and Yvonne Brill of NV; and Geert and Leslie Van Brandt-Brill of MD. Adored by all who knew and cared for her Aunt Ruth's vivacious spirit will live on. Contributions may be made to The Jewish Guild for the Blind and Congregation B'nai Jeshurun. A service will be held at 12:30 P.M., Thursday, March 30th at Plaza Memorial Chapel, 630 Amsterdam Ave., New York City.
