        TENGA--Carmine M. The New York State Banking Department acknowledges with great sorrow the passing of our dear friend, and former colleague, Carmine M. Tenga. Mr. Tenga was a Career Examiner with the Banking Department, joining in 1968. Through hard work and determination, he rose through the ranks to become Deputy Superintendent of The Banking Department, while also serving as Acting Superintendent in 1994. During his tenure at the Department, he made a lasting mark and years after his retirement, colleagues continued to regard Carmine as a great mentor, friend and devoted public servant. We extend our deepest sympathy to his loving wife, Joyce.
