        DOLE--Vincent P., M.D. We often jostled over the state of the art in responding to the mounting addiction crises, yet very early on we found it so very difficult to overlook the caring physician in Vince Dole. He genuinely grieved over the plight of this town's young caught up in the mad whirl of the needle and the spoon His words breathed their agony. Indeed, we have lost a giant and a dear fiend. We offer prayerful support to his Loved Ones and his Colleagues across this City and the universe of the suffering. (Msgr.) William B. O'Brien President, Daytop Village Inc.
        $(6$)DOLE--Vincent P. The patients and staff of the Division of Substance Abuse, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine are deeply saddened at the passing of Vincent P. Dole, MD, pioneer developer of methadone maintenance treatment for opioid addiction. Dr. Dole's landmark research at Rockefeller University inspired the establishment of these life-saving treatment services at Einstein in 1970. In 1995, Dr. Dole was honored with our Division's Beatrice Bishop Berle Award in recognition of his compassionate contributions and steadfast advocacy for dignified, patient - centered addiction treatment. We have lost the gentle giant of our field. We extend our deepest sympathy to his family and colleagues. Ira J. Marion, Executive Dir., Division of Substance Abuse, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva University
