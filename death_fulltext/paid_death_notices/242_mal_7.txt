        BERKMAN--Kenneth S. The entire law firm of Berkman, Henoch, Peterson & Peddy, P.C. mourns with extreme sadness the sudden death of a founder of the firm, Kenneth S. Berkman. From the day the firm opened its doors 25 years ago until the day of his death, Ken devoted his considerable energy and thoughts to building the firm and serving the needs of our clients while remaining a compassionate and caring person. He was an extraordinary person and lawyer. Born in Kew Gardens, NY, he was a graduate of Cornell University and New York Law School. He served as a second Lieutenant in the U.S. Army Intelligence. Ken and his wife of 52 years, Irene, moved to Huntington, NY, in 1958. Over the years in Huntington, he served as a member of the Board of Education of the Harborfields School District for 10 years, including services as President. He was a Director of the Nassau Mental Health Association and the Guidedog Foundation as well as a member of the Township Theatre of Huntington, the Town of Hempstead Industrial Development Agency, the Advisory Board of First American Title Insurance Company, and the HSBC Bank Advisory Board. We will miss him deeply. In addition to his wife, Ken is survived by his children, Eric and Caroline, Richard and Stacey, and Michael and Randi, as well as six beautiful granddaughters, Nicole, Natalie, Jillian, Sarah, Hannah, and Madeline. The family requests that contributions in Ken's honor be made to the Guidedog Foundation.
