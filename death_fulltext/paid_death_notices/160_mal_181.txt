        FELDMAN-Robert. We are deeply grieved to have lost the Chairman of our Board, Robert Feldman. Robert Feldman, a man of understanding, compassion, humor and generosity, served this Board and the children of New York City for over forty years. He devoted his talent, energy and time to helping the students of the High School of Fashion Industries succeed in school and prepare for their future careers. A true gentle man, he made all whose lives he touched better people. The Members of the Fashion Crafts Educational Commission
