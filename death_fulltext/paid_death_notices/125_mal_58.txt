        LEHMANN-Dr. Manfred R. Last Friday, Dr. Manfred Lehmann was taken from us. The loss to his family is unimaginable. The loss to Eretz Israel is irreparable, and to his admirers and friends his passing has caused deepest sorrow. Freddy was the personification of the Universal Man, a leader and mentor to all who had the honor of meeting and knowing him. In his philosphies, he represented all that is rare and admirable. His enthusiasm and devotion to causes close to his heart were expressed in his writings, in his conversations, in his Being. His charity knew no bounds. He gave to all in need. He was such a brilliant man. The languages, his knowledge of history, archeology, politics, there was no area he was not interested in and conversant with and shared those ideas and feelings generously. All my compassion goes out to you my dearest friend Anne, to Barbie, Karrie and their families. I am mourning your loss with you. Betty Retter
