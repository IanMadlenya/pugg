        $(6$)BERNS--Jerry. The staff and patrons of 21 will greatly miss our beloved ''Mr. Jerry'' as he was known across the globe. Immortalized forever in books by Sidney Sheldon, James Beard and Martin Scorsese, Mr. Jerry helped rule the roost from 1938-1985 with his older brother, cofounder Charlie, and his cousins, Jack, Mac, Bob and Pete Kriendler. Just like Mr. Pete five years earlier, he passed away on December 21. Our hearts go out to his wife Dorothy, his daughter Cecily and her husband Stan, his grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Heres hoping, Mr. Jerry, that heaven has chocolate leaves. Bryan McGuire, General Manager and the 21 Club staff
