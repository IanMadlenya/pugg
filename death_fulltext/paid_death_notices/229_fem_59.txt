        KEAN--Mallory G. B. Of Far Hills, NJ, suddenly on January 27, 2006. Friend to many new and old, she gave so much to us all, touching more people than anyone can count. A thoroughly developed appreciation for life in all its forms and of the mysteries of nature for which she had a deep love. It is not the years in our lives, but the life in our years. Mallory was the cherished wife, mentor and partner of Robert W. Kean III. In addition to Roy, she was a loving and engaged role model and friend in so many ways to her stepchildren Bobby, Philip and Nina Kean, who will always have her in their hearts. Mallory's unforgettable electric energy continues with us all. Memorial donations can be made in Mallory's name to The Museum of the City of New York Directors' Council, 1220 Fifth Ave, NYC 10029; and to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center at P.O. Box 27106, NYC 10087-7106. Mallory's memorial service will be at Church of the Heavenly Rest, Fifth Avenue at 90th Street, NYC, on Thursday, February 9th, at 4 PM. No flowers please.
