        FLEISCHMAN-Lawrence A. The Friends and Patrons of the Arts of the Vatican Museums record with deep regret the death of its founding member, the architect of its major successes in acquisition and conservation, and a dear personal friend. His work and generosity also led to the construction of the Cardinal Cooke Conservation Laboratory at the Vatican Museums. He was created a Knight of St. Sylvestre of the Holy See for his leadership and care of the fine arts at the Museums. Lucy F. McGrath, Chairman Monsignor Eugene V. Clark
