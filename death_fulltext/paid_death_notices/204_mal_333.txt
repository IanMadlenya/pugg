        SULCER--Frederick ''Sandy.'' DDB Worldwide and its staff deeply mourn the death of advertising great Sandy Sulcer. The former copywriter, who penned ''Put a Tiger in Your Tank,'' achieved tremendous success during his tenure in the advertising industry, rising through the ranks to become Chairman of Needham Harper & Steers International and later Vice Chairman of DDB Needham Worldwide before retiring in 1994. His enthusiasm for the industry never waned though, and he continued to teach and write about the subject until his death. We are grateful to have been touched by his extraordinary generosity and commitment, and express our deepest sympathy to the Sulcer family. To remember and celebrate Sandy's life, a memorial service will be held at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home on Madison Avenue at 81st Street in New York on Friday, January 30, at 3:30 p.m.
