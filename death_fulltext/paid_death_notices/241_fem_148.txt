        THOMAS--Emma Welling. Emma Welling Thomas (known as ''Welling'') died at New York-Presbyterian Hospital on January 14th after a brief illness. An attorney specializing in trusts and estates law, she had worked at several well-known firms in New York City and Providence, Rhode Island. Since 1994, Thomas had been at The Bank of New York. Born in New York City on January 5, 1949, she attended Abbot Academy at Andover, Massachusetts; St. Claire's College in Oxford, England; Bryn Mawr College; Teachers College at Columbia University; and Rutgers Law School in Newark. Like her grandfather, the Socialist leader Norman M. Thomas, she was committed to social and economic justice for all members of our society. She is survived by her husband, Erik Bradford Stocker, and her son, William Welling Sheehan, now of Charlestown, Rhode Island. A memorial gathering will be held at The University Club in New York City in late April. The family requests that donations be made to The Central Park Conservancy's Adopt - A Bench program (14 East 60th Street, New York, NY 10022) toward a bench in her memory.
