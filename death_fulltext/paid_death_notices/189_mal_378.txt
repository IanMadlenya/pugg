        WELLSTONE-Senator Paul. The Board of Trustees of the New York Society for Ethical Culture mourns the tragic passing of Senator Paul Wellstone, his wife and daughter. Senator Wellstone was the recipient of Ethical Culture's 1997 Ethical Humanist Award for ''Courageous actions in protesting the 1996 Welfare Reform Legislation.'' We extend our deepest sympathy to the Senator's family and friends.
