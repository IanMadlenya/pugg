        RATLIFF-Floyd. The Rockefeller University community mourns with deep sadness the loss of our distinguished colleague and beloved friend, Floyd Ratliff. Dr. Ratliff was a pioneer in the study of the neural mechanisms of vision, particularly how the retina performs the task of analyzing and reducing the apparent chaos of incoming data. A valued member of The Rockefeller University community for more than 40 years, he will long be remembered for his contributions to the scientific understanding of the visual system, as well as for his deep commitment and skill as a teacher. Dr. Ratliff will be profoundly missed. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife and to his family. Arnold J. Levine, President Richard Fisher, Chairman Board of Trustees David Rockefeller, Honorary Chairman and Life Trustee Board of Trustees
