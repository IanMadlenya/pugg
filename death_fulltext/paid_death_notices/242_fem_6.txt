        MILLER--Rosetta. A memorial service for Rosetta Averil Miller, beloved wife of thirty years of Samuel C. Miller, Director Emeritus of The Newark Museum, will be held on Friday, March 16, 10:30 am, at The Church of Saint Mary the Virgin, 145 West 46th Street, New York City. A native of South Carolina, Mrs. Miller was well known in theatrical circles and in the art world as the consummate hostess, one who never forgot a name or a personal association. She enthusiastically embraced the City of Newark and its civic culture, especially its museum. She assisted her husband in raising the then unheard of sum of $23 million for The Newark Museums Master Plan Renovation by Michael Graves in 1989. Contributions in memory of Rosetta A. Miller may be made to The Newark Museum Association, 49 Washington Street, Newark, NJ 07102.
