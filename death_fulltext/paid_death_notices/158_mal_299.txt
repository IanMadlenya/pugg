        FISHMAN-Jack, M.D. Of NYC and Delray Beach, FL at age 91. We deeply mourn the loss of our loving father. He was a dedicated surgeon and compassionate family practitioner in NYC for over half a century. During the Second World War he was a Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Navy, where he was critically wounded. He served on numerous hospital staffs before his retirement. He taught at NY Medical College and was published in medical journals and textbooks. He passed away earlier this year at his home in Florida. We miss him greatly.
