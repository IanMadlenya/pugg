        ROBBIE--Seymour, a prolific television director from the earliest days of the medium, died June 17th at his Beverly Hills home after a long battle with ALS. He was 84. Robbie, who grew up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, entered the business as a pageboy for CBS in New York and was soon directing such early live shows as ''Studio One'' and ''Omnibus,'' where his ''Life of Samuel Johnson'' won a Sylvania Award. His other ''Omnibus'' shows included scripts by William Saroyan and Gore Vidal, in which he directed such stars as Geraldine Page and Helen Hayes. In a career that spanned both coasts over four decades, Robbie directed hundreds of TV drama and comedy episodes dating from Jackie Gleason's ''American Scene Magazine'' and including ''The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,'' ''F-Troop,'' ''Lost in Space,'' ''Mannix,'' ''It Takes A Thief,'' ''Barnaby Jones,'' ''Kojak,'' ''Hart to Hart,'' ''Murder She Wrote'' and ''Remington Steele.'' He also directed two feature films, ''CC & Company,'' starring Ann-Margret and Joe Namath, and ''Marco,'' starring Zero Mostel. He is survived by his wife of 63 years, Shirley, and sons, Paul of Los Angeles and Thomas of Seattle.
