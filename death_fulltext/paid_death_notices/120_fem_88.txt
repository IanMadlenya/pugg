        GUTHRIE-Elizabeth A. The Board of Directors of the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation records with deep sorrow the death of our dear friend and colleague on January 13, 1997. We remember her intelligence and strength of purpose, qualities which contributed substantially to the Foundation's work throughout her 41 years of service. Her enthusiasm and courage were inspiring, and she will be greatly missed. We extend condolences to her family, and especially to our fellow director, her husband, Henry.
