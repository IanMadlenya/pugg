        HATCH -- Rakia. Columbia University Medical Center and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital will always be indebted to the Hatch Family for its long legacy of support, and we honor the memory of Rakia Hatch for personifying this legacy. Rakia, with her husband, Richard, continued the legacy of Margaret Milliken Hatch and Harold A. Hatch by generously supporting faculty, research, and programs at the hospital and the university. Their generosity benefited programs and research in cardiology, surgery, nursing, radiology, breast cancer, and medical center leadership. The Hatch Magnetic Resonance Research Center is a world-class center that contributes a broad range of imaging resources for Columbia research. Our sympathy goes to the entire Hatch family on the loss of their beloved Rakia. Gerald D.
