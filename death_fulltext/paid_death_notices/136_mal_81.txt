        CHASE-Reverend William J. The members, staff and Board of Fountain House express deep sorrow at the loss of our Director and friend, who, since 1954, served on our Board. Bill was a guiding and considerate force through our early uncertain days, and in immeasurable ways helped Fountain House grow steadily and surely, to achieve national and international recognition in the field of psychiatric rehabilitation. His friendship and kindness will be missed by all of us.
