        BESSO--Victor. My beloved husband, my darling, mi amore, my world. You will always be in my heart. Nidia $(6$)BESSO--Victor. We will always remember your love, guidance and sense of humor. Alina, Jack, Scarlett and Jasmine Taylor. $(6$)BESSO--Victor 81, passed away November 23, 2006. Retired President of PTC Partners, Executive VP of Intsel and PUK. Awarded the French Legion d'Honneur in 1978. Trustee Emeritus of Baruch College. He was featured in the book 12 Who Made it Big. Among his quotes in that publication: ''The hardest part of my job is making the right decision knowing as much as possible about as many things as possible''. Another was '' ........I have been blessed with a particular knack for languages that allow me to masquerade as a Frenchman when among Americans and as an American when among French. As a consequence, I often found myself with exciting tasks, such as defending the French during DeGaulle's gold raids or of explaining the American presence in Vietnam. Because of my love for both countries, it has not been a chore, but rather, a challenge.'' I miss you so much. Who will make me laugh now. Your darling wife, Nidia.
