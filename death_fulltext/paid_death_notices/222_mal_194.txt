        OREMLAND--Melvyn J. The board of trustees, the president, and the faculty and staff of Pace University mourn with profound sadness the loss of Melvyn Oremland, a professor of physics and astronomy who taught more than 5000 students in his 39 years at Pace. Dr. Oremland was instrumental in creating courses for the core curriculum as well as in making the Forensic Studies program a success. He was also proud to serve as chair of the New York Faculty Council. We extend our deep sympathies to his wife, Lenore, his son, Dr. Gordon Oremland, and daughter, Patricia, and his grandchild.
