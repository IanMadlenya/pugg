        WRISTON--Walter. For his many friends the world without Walter Wriston may be very different. His quiet support in any personal crisis, his wise counsel always emphasizing the positives in any situation--local, national or worldwide, his renowned humor, always uplifting, and endless other caring ways that he made life more constructive and enjoyable. As one who benefited from 50 years of friendship as a business associate and his tennis double partner, perhaps I can make a pledge that others would support. Difficult as it will be without Walter, we will as an ongoing memorial try each day to make the world a better place as he did. With respect and affection. Oscar Dunn
