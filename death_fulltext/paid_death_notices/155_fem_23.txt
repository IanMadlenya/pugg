        KAUFMAN-Rita. Her home was our house of delights when we were children visiting New York. As adults, we learned from her strength, often cited by our mother, as Aunt Rita met the triumphs and tragedies of her life. Happy memories of Aunt Rita, Uncle Ben, and their splendid children are a blessing to us. Gabrielle Ribach Propp & Deborah Ribach & Zwang
        KAUFMAN-Rita. Congregation Shaarei Tikva mourns the passing of Rita Kaufman, beloved mother of our member and friend Belda Lindenbaum. May the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Charles Rudansky, Rabbi
