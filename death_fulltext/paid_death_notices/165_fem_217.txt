        GLICKMAN-Sara. The Board of Directors and Staff of Family Focus Adoption Services mourn the loss of our Board member and friend, and one of the founding Board members of our agency, Sara Glickman, who died yesterday. Sara was a tireless adoption advocate and activist who worked as an Adoption Specialist and Adoption Supervisor at this agency for thirteen years before her recent retirement and return to our Board. She will be remembered as an outspoken and creative woman with more than fortytwo years of linkage to the local and national adoption communities. All of us will miss her unflagging commitment to ''waiting'' children and adoptive family life. Our deepest sympathies go to her husband Arthur, and children Alan and Mindy. Joel Fridovich, Board President Maris Blechner, Exec Director
