        UNGAR-Philip. It is with deep sorrow that we record the death of Philip Ungar, the husband of his late beloved wife, Beatrice (nee Helman), in his 94th year. His inclusion in the Helman Family for the past seven decades has been marked with unfailing devotion and affection. His gentle kindness and genuineness in relating to others brought him the respect and affection of all who knew him. His contribution to our enterprise has been an invaluable and enduring legacy. We extend our condolences to his devoted and beloved son, David. Gilbert and Joy Helman Denice H. Rein
