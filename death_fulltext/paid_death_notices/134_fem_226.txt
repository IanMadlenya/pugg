        CAMPBELL-Sister Antoine. The entire Marymount School community mourns the death of Sister Antoine Campbell, RSHM, a beloved educator and friend. She served our students, parents and alumnae for more than forty years as a dedicated Teacher of Latin and speech, Headmistress, and Director Alumnae Relations. In addition to her sincere fondness for each student, she will be lovingly remembered for her quiet humor and gentle elegance. Her legacy lives on at Marymount through the alumnae established Sister Antoine Campbell Faculty Endowment Fund and the commencement award given each year to the graduate who exemplifies her values of kindness, generosity and genuine concern for others. She will remain in our hearts and minds as a woman of faith who served her God and shared her gifts with others. A memorial service will be held at Marymount School, 1026 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York, Thursday, April 23 at 6 P.M.
