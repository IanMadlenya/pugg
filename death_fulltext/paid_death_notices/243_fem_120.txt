        GOLDSMITH--Frieda Kittay. Cherished wife of the late A. Philip Goldsmith and the late Sol Kittay. An elegant woman and role model of femininity, she brought grace and beauty to all she knew. Fluent in many languages and very much involved in the world of the arts, in particular French history and culture.
