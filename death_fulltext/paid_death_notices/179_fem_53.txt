        SHUSTER-Joan. It is with profound sadness that we say goodbye to Joan. Loving wife, mother, nanny, daughter, sister, aunt and friend. Funeral will be held at Riverside Memorial Chapel on Sunday, December 9 at 11:45 AM. All contributions should be made to Visiting Nurse and Hospice Care of Southwestern CT, 1029 East Main St., Stamford, CT 06902. In typical Joan style, she fought hard till the end. We will miss her dearly every day.
