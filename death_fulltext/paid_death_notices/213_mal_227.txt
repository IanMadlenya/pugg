        STEIGMAN -- Stephen. The Lennox - Weberman family deeply mourns the loss of their dear friend Steve, devoted and loving husband of Peggy Flaum and adoring and proud father of their daughter, Willy. He will always be remembered by his friends who so greatly admired and profoundly valued his quiet intelligence, his ironic wit, his creative vision. Time spent with Steve was always joyful and he has provided us with memories we will cherish forever. We love you Steve and we miss you. Roy, Joan, Oliver, Molly, Trina and James
