        SEIDMANN-Sharon Norry. The Board and staff of the National Foundation for Jewish Culture mourn the passing of Sharon Norry Seidmann, a loving friend and devoted Board member. As an artist and communal leader, Sharon was committed to the enrichment of Jewish life in Rochester, across the United States and throughout the world. She brought unique beauty, creativity and refinement to our lives and our work. Our hearts go out to Avi, Lewis, Elliot, Hillel and her entire family. May her memory continue to inspire all those whose lives she touched. James M. August, President Lynn K.
