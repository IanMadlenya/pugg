        FIELD--Howard O. Writer extraordinaire passed from his dear family and friends. He played his trump card on April 13, 2007 in Palm Springs, CA. He is survived by his loving life partner of 50 years, Jack Kellogg, his sister Elayne, his nieces and nephews Alex and Syd, Doug and Janis, Liz and Michael, and Nick and Cynthia, and so many wonderful and loving cousins and friends who will also share deeply the loss of this funny and engaging man. Howard loved Hollywood and after graduating USC he was signed as the youngest contract writer at MGM Studios. He was one of the first writers of plays for television but the Big Apple beckoned and he went off to write for Young & Rubicam, Grey and Compton Advertising Agencies. Howard served his country in the Navy in WWII and it is there that he forged a friendship with Joe Papp, as they worked to entertain the fellow troops. Their friendship fostered Howard's love of Broadway Theater. He was a Broadway Angel to help support Theater. California called again and Howard and Jack moved out to be closer to family. He continued with advertising at Irwin Wasey and settled in the west coast style, choosing to retire in Palm Springs. We will miss him. Everyone who ever met him, never forgot him. He will always be our Star. Funeral Services will be at Hollywood Forever Cemetery, Beth Olam at 11:00am, Sunday April 22nd, 2007, 6000 Santa Monica Blvd, Hollywood. In lieu of flowers, please make donations to charity of your choice. A celebration of his life is planned for the near future in Palm Springs.
