A creative and talented designer at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, he will long be remembered by his many friends and family for his courage, humor, joy in life, and kindness. An aunt, Maxine Webb; cousins, Rodney and Ralph Webb; and his longtime companion, Christian Duvernois, survive him. A memorial service will be announced at a future date.
