        DAVIS-Sophie. The arts have lost a great friend and remarkable lady. Sophie Davis had a long history of cultivating and providing the finest in the performing arts-and providing communities with the knowledge of what the finest is. She brought an enormous sense of good taste, practicality and good old-fashioned show business timing to any project. The Kravis Center had the good fortune to have her ear, heart, and wisdom for so many years. Our heartfelt condolences to Leonard, Alan, Michael and their families. Judith Shepherd Mitchell Chief Executive Officer Alexander W. Dreyfoos, Jr., Board Chairman Kravis Center for the Performing Arts, West Palm Beach, Florida
