        BURNAP--Elaine It is with great sadness that Clement F. Burnap announces the death of his deeply loving and ever-helpful wife and business partner, on September 22, 2006 after a long illness. Elaine Burnap was born in Cleveland, OH, on October 22, 1923. She attended Wellesley College during World War II, but had to leave to go to work in the South Portland Shipyard in Maine. She was married to Clement F. Burnap on December 11, 1943. In the subsequent 28 years she traveled with Mr. Burnap to some 109 countries as they worked on large industrial contracts ranging from chemical plant equipment to port cranes. After returning to the States from London, Elaine furthered her education and was graduated with a BA in Political Science from UCLA and then earned a MA degree in Intellectual History from UC Irvine. In 1974 she joined East Bay Municipal Utilities District where, as Assistant Manager of the Legal Department, she was instrumental in implementing the transition to networked microcomputers thereby freeing the company from operating only from the mainframe computer. During this period she received a Masters of Public Administration from Golden Gate University. Elaine is remembered as a culinary master with a truly international palette bringing pleasure to her household and those of others. Widely read and deeply informed, Elaine supported causes such as Amnesty International and Doctors Without Borders. As per her wishes, no services will be held and her ashes will be scattered at sea.
