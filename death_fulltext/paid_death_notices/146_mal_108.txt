        WARDWELL-Allen, 64. Died March 1 of a heart attack while vacationing in Colorado. He was a preeminent specialist in the art of the Northwest Coast Indian shaman, and a senior consultant in American Indian Art and Tribal Art at Christie's in New York. Wardwell, who was educated at Groton, Yale, and New York University, decided against joining the law firm of Davis, Polk and Wardwell, founded by his grandfather and in which his father was a partner, choosing instead to make a career of his passion for fine art. After receiving his Master's in Art History, Wardwell served as head of the Primitive Art Dept at the Art Institute of Chicago from 1960-1973, and was director of the Asia Society Gallery, New York, from 1974-1984. From 1986 to 1990 Wardwell was director of the Isamu Noguchi Garden Museum in New York. He also taught university courses at various times and, among his many consulting activities was curatorial consultant for African and Oceanic Art at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Wardwell was the author of several books and catalogues within his fields, including the recently published study of Northwest Coast shamanic Indian art, ''Tangible Visions''. Wardwell was also passionate about music and dancing, went frequently to the Rainbow Room, and could be seen dancing on his roller skates almost every weekend in Central Park. Allen leaves his wife Sally, a daughter Lelia, his sons William and Alexander, his granddaughter Sarah, two sisters Lelia Seidner and Helen DuBois, and his aunt Clarissa Pell. He was the father-in-law of Deborah Wardwell, Henriette Wardwell, and Edmund Mander. He is also survived by several cousins, nieces and nephews and many, many friends.
