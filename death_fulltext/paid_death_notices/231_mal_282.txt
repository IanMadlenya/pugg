        KAPLAN--Sanford. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) mourn the loss of our great friend, Sanford Kaplan of Los Angeles. A brilliant but modest man, Sandy was a noted philanthropist who supported numerous causes. His commitment to the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology was a manifestation of his profound love for the Jewish people and Israel. After serving in the Navy in World War II, Sandy launched a stellar career as a manager and financial executive at Scientific Data Systems, Xerox, and Intel, on whose boards he later served for many years. As a pioneer in the computer industry, Sandy also committed his energy and financial resources to the development of science and technology in Israel. His sustained generosity and devoted service as a member of the ATS National Board of Directors and Board of Regents and the Technion International Board of Governors earned him the most prestigious honors the university and the ATS can bestow: an Honorary Doctorate and the Albert Einstein Award. Through the Sanford Kaplan Chair in Aerospace Engineering, the Sanford Kaplan Family Dormitory, the Sanford Kaplan Prize for Creative Management in 21st Century High Technology, and the Kaplan VIP Rooms in the Technion's Leon and Julia Forchheimer Faculty Center, his name will be forever linked with the Technion, which he supported at the highest level. Our hearts go out to his daughters, Judith and Margaret Kaplan. Like their father, both are Technion Guardians and Margaret is a valued member of the National ATS Board of Directors.
