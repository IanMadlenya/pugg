        ESTABROOK--F. Reed, Jr. The entire Avon Old Farms School community mourns the passing of our esteemed alumnus, Director, and former Board Chairman. A member of the Class of 1936, Reed Estabrook was ''Mr. Avon Old Farms'' to thousands of students, alumni, faculty and staff and their families. He served as an active member of the Board of Directors from 1948 until his death--providing extraordinary vision, leadership and support for every aspect of the School. He chaired the Board from 1965 to 1992. Moreover, he represented the School throughout the independent secondary school community and was instrumental in the founding of the Independent School Chairman's Association. In 1947--following World War II, when the School was closed and the property used as an army convalescent hospital--Reed Estabrook was joined by a small group of alumni and friends, who worked to reassemble a faculty, staff and student body to reopen the Old Farms campus. His remarkable endeavors and deep passion for the School during the next six decades helped position Avon Old Farms as one of America's great secondary schools. We join in extending heartfelt condolences to Reed's marvelous wife, Nancy, and to his entire family. Rolf H. Olson, Class of '59 Chairman Kenneth H. LaRocque Headmaster
