        RICHSTONE-David. July 22, 1912 to November 22, 1998. Teacher, horticulturist, unparalleled scholar of the English Language. Loving to and loved by all who knew him. A man without guile or deception, with no ambition other than excellence in all his pursuits. He leaves a grieving family with an unfillable hole. ''He was a man, take him for all in all, I shall not look upon his like again.''
