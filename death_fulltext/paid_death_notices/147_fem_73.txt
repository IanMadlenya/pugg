        TYNG-Lila Hotz. It is with deep sadness that the Board of Directors and Staff of Berkshire Farm Center and Services for Youth record the passing of Lila Tyng. She was a vital and generous member of our Board for 36 years. She put her skills, charm and love of children to work on behalf of Berkshire Farm Center, helping it to grow to a state-wide organization. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to her sons and the entire family. Charles H. Mott, President
