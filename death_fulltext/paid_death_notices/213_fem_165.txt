        HARTSTONE--Marcia R. Age 82, died unexpectedly September 29, 2004, at her home on Bainbridge Island, WA. Marcia was born in Boston, MA, on January 12, 1922, to Joseph and Gertrude (Burnce) Rosen. In 1941, she married Leon C. Hartstone, and in 1950, they moved with their three children to Valley Stream, NY. Marcia worked as a secretary at ABC-TV while her husband worked for London Records. Marcia and Lee were instrumental in bringing the musicals ''Stop the World, I Want to Get Off'' and ''Oliver'' to Broadway. In 1964, the family moved to the San Francisco Bay Area where Marcia worked for her husband in the family record business. Marcia and Lee moved back to New York City in 1968; Marcia worked for Record World magazine. In 1970, they moved to Los Angeles to start a new venture, Integrity Entertainment, and continued working together until Lee's death in 1982. Marcia spent the ensuing years as a hospital volunteer, while also pursuing her lifelong interest in world travel, needlecrafts and tending to her beloved schnauzers and dachshunds. In 2001, Marcia moved to Bainbridge Island to spend her final years with her daughters. She is survived by daughters Jane E. Stone and Judith Hartstone of Bainbridge Island, son Roger Hartstone of Flagstaff, AZ, and grandchildren Joseph and Laura.
