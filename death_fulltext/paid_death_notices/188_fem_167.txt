        SPRUNG-Mary, 92. In Manhattan. Beloved wife of the late Murray Sprung, devoted mother of Peggy and John, mother-in-law of Richard Neimeth and Riki Sprung, sister of Sam Norkin, grandmother of Deborah, Pamela, Amy, Lisa, Jason and Larry and great-grandmother of 12. A camp director, teacher and care giver, her kindness and good deeds live on. She was the queen of our hearts, which are heavy with loss.
