        FRIEDBERG-Marjorie. On May 15, 1998, I lost my dear friend of over 50 years. Her many friends of long standing amongst them, Clara Fox, Lola Pergament, Jeannette and Erwin Held mourn her loss with me. She will also be missed by her colleagues and former students at NYU where she taught for over 30 years. Margie, you will always be in our hearts and thoughts. Fannie Sherr
