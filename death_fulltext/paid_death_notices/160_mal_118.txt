        FAIRBANKS-Douglas, Jr., KBE, DSC. On behalf of all members of The Order of St. John, we express our profound sorrow over the passing of our confrere, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Having become a Knight of the Order of St. John in Great Britain, Douglas played a major role in the establishment and growth of the Order in the United States, and was a Life Governor of the American Society of the Order of St. John. For more than fifty years, he performed many services for the Order, both in the United Kingdom and the United States. We will miss his cheerful and optimistic advice. In celebration of his life and friendship, we send our prayers and best wishes to his wife, Vera, and to his daughters, Daphne, Victoria, and Melissa. John R. Drexel IV, Prior Corbin R. Miller, Chancellor Don W. Lundquist, Secretary The Priory in the United States of America of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem
