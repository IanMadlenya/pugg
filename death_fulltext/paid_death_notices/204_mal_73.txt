        YAHR--Dr. Melvin D. We mourn the death of our teacher, mentor and dear friend. His work on levodopa therapy revolutionized the treatment of Parkinson's disease and changed the life of millions of patients worldwide, initiating a new era of movement disorder re search. He was an early and strong supporter of women in academic medicine. An internationally renowned clinical neuroscientist and neurologist dedicated to his patients, he was highly principled and posessed impeccable ethics. To those who knew Melvin Yahr, his personal qualities were just as important as his great professional acumen, and perhaps, even more so. His presence enriched our lives. His passing leaves a void impossible to fill. Our thoughts are with his family in their time of grief. Alessandro Di Rocco, M.D. Maria-Felice Ghilardi, M.D. Martin R.
