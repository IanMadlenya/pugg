        FASTENBERG-Arthur. The Director, Board of Trustees and staff of The Jewish Museum mourn the loss of Arthur Fastenberg, a friend and supporter of this Institution. His commitment to the preservation and continuance of Jewish culture made him a vital member of our community. We will always be grateful for his meaningful contribution to our permanent exhibition through the establishment of the Eve & Arthur Fastenberg and Shirley & Marvin Fastenberg Gallery. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife Eve, his brother Marvin and his sister-in-law Shirley. Joan Rosenbaum, Helen Goldsmith Menschel Director Robert J.
