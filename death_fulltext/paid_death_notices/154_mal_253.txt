        POPKIN-George, MD. Esteemed colleague, teacher and friend will be missed by his patients, students, associates and staff. George was a pioneer in skin surgery. Foreign and American dermatologists were welcome to the New York University Medical Center and Bethpage office to observe his work. It was our privilege to have been associated with George for 40 years. To Sally, Ann and David we send our heartfelt condolences. Charlotte and Sheldon Brodie
