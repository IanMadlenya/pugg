        FESEFELDT-Julie. All of us at Slomin's mourn the passing, on April 26th, of our cherished Julie Fesefeldt, who from the age of 17 has been a part of our ''family''. Julie brought sunshine into the lives of all who knew her. In the last three years she increased our breast cancer awareness and epitomized courage in the face of adversity. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Bob and Tommy; Lucy, Donna, Jack and Michael.
