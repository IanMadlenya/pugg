        ASH-Sylvia. The entire Beth Israel Medical Center family joins with the leadership of its parent company, Continuum Health Partners, in acknowledging with sadness the passing of our dear friend and benefactress, Sylvia Ash. Together with her beloved husband Ernest, they provided important philanthropic support to Beth Israel's Singer Division. Their generosity was recognized with the naming of the Sylvia and Ernest Ash Auditorium in 1994. She will forever be remembered by all whom have benefited from her care and compassion. To Ernest, their family and all of her loved ones, we extend heartfelt condolences. Morton P. Hyman, Chairman, Boards of Trustees Continuum and Beth Israel Peter A.
