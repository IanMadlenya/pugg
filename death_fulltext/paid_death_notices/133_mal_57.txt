        CASSILLY-Richard. The Metropolitan Opera deeply mourns the death of our beloved colleague and friend, Richard Cassilly. A versatile and generous artist, he sang more than 150 performances of 14 roles with the company, and created the roles of Jimmy Mahoney in Weill's ''Mahagonny'' and the title role in Stravinsky's ''Oedipus Rex'' in the Met premieres of those works. He appeared in Met telecasts of ''Mahagonny'' and ''Tannhauser'' and will be remembered for his vivid portrayals in a wide variety of dramatic tenor roles with our company. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Patricia, and to his family. Joseph Volpe, General Manager James Levine, Artistic Director
