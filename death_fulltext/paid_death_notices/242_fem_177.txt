        CHESS--Stella, M.D. The Bellevue family mourns the loss of Dr. Stella Chess, an eminent clinician, researcher and educator. She loved Bellevue and the mission to care for the undeserved. Countless trainees and colleagues were privileged to have been taught by this pioneer in Child and Adolscent Psychiatry. She was vibrant, clinically astute and insisted on simple descriptive language rather than psychiatric jargon. We continue to strive to live up to her vision of listening, observing and above all, understanding a child's 'style'. Lynda D. Curtis, Executive Director Manuel Trujillo, M.D., Director of Psychiatry
