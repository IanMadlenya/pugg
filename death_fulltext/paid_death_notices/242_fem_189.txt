The Officers and Directors of The Garden Club of America express deep sorrow on the death of their former President, Katharine (Kitty) Crowninshield Ferguson, and extend deepest sympathy to her husband, David L., and her family and friends.

She was a Zone Chairman, member of the Finance Committee, Policy Committee and was part of the Endowment Campaign. Kitty was the recipient of the Zone Creative Leadership Award. Mrs. Ferguson made considerable contributions to The Garden Club of America. She will be remembered for her warm, gentle and loving nature, her generous spirit and gracious manner. She was an inspiration to anyone who was fortunate enough to meet her. In lieu of flowers, contributions in her memory can be made to Tower Hill Botanic Garden, 11 French Drive, Boylston, MA 01505, or The Garden Club of America, 14 East 60th Street, NY, NY 10022.
