        TANNENBAUM-Muriel. Congregation Or Zarua mourns the death of our member and trustee Muriel Tannenbaum. Muriel was a woman who encouraged us daily to attain the goals of serious study, prayer and fellowship. We shall miss her wise and caring counsel and especially her love. May He who consoles the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem bring comfort to her family. Dr. Harlan J. Wechsler, Rabbi Daniel J. Beller, President
