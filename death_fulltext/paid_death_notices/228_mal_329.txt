        WYCKOFF--James, whose understanding and compassion touched the lives of many, died on Tuesday January 24 at the age of 87. The depth and breadth of his thought found expression in his work as a writer and teacher. All those who were related to him by blood, those who cared for him in his final years, and those who were related to him through their search for what is true, will sorely miss him.
