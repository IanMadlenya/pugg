        PACK-Dick. We are saddened by the sudden passing of Television Quarterly's brilliant editor Dick Pack. Two decades ago he came to us and guided TVQ to become a publication of quality and universal respect. The magazine will always stand as a tribute to his leadership, intelligence and irresistible personality. To his wife Laura, his close family and friends and all of us at the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, we offer our deepest sympathy. He leaves us with something very wonderful. We have been richer as human beings and as professionals for having known him and worked with him. Respectfully, John Cannon, President National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences
        PACK-Richard. The Editorial Board of Television Quarterly, which he edited brilliantly and imaginatively for nearly 20 years after a distinguished career in radio and television, mourn his death on July 1 at the age of 83 and extend deepest sympathy to his family. Memorial service Saturday, July 10, at 12:30PM, 245 Edgemont Road, Scarsdale, N.Y.
