        FRIEDMAN-Rivka. AMIT is deeply grieved by the passing of a most active and dedicated volunteer, beloved wife of our dear friend and colleague Israel Friedman, Executive Vice President Emeritus of the Religious Zionists of America. Rivka Friedman's love of Torah values, Zionism, and AMIT's needy children, was a model for us all. She will be sorely missed. Heartfelt condolences to the entire family. Sondra Sokal, President Marvin Leff, Executive Director
