        HAYDEN--Melissa. Melissa Hayden was one of the great ballerinas of her time. She was a principal dancer at New York City Ballet from 1955 to 1973, and George Balanchine choreographed leading roles for her in over 20 of his ballets, including such masterpieces as Agon, Liebeslieder Walzer, A Midsummer Night's Dream, and Stars and Stripes. With her vibrant personality and confident charm, she stood out both on stage and off, and her loss is deeply mourned by Peter Martins and the dancers, ballet masters, musicians, staff and Board of Directors of New York City Ballet. We extend our condolences to her family.
