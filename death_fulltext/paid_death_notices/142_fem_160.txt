        KORN-Mrs. Richard Kaye. We mourn the loss of Peggy Korn, our Honorary Board Member and Past Board President. Peggy was one of a kind: smart, involved, cultured, and opinionated. She also cared a great deal about those in need, as exemplified by her long involvement with our social service organization. We will miss her and can't imagine that another like her will come along again anytime soon. Diana R. Quasha, President Nancy Wackstein, Exec Dir. Lenox Hill Neighborhood House
