        LANDAU--Jean-Claude. The remaining officers and scientists of Atlantic Dyestuff Corporation and American Dyestuff Corporation note with sorrow the passing of their colleague. Jean-Claude left our industry more than a half century ago. Jean-Claude came to us after MIT and after graduate work in Zurich under Nobel Laureate Professor Paul Karrer. Upon leaving chemistry to enter his family business, Jean-Claude left behind many unique syntheses of dyes, some of which are still used today throughout the world. The most wonderful remark about him was made by a colleague ''he is the most civilized person I have ever met!''. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Solange and to his children and grandchildren. Rubin Rabinowitz, Chairman American Dyestuff Corporation Clifton, New Jersey
