She was the beloved wife of Ira, cherished sister of Douglas and Scott Velsor and Joan Petrillo, loving stepmother of Rani Dalgin, Jessica Kahan, Lara Ewen and Britt Ewen. She is also survived by four nieces, a nephew, two aunts, and many cousins and grandchildren. Her light will shine forever on those who loved her. Susan's career began at the Ford Foundation. She then worked for 30 years as an educator for the New York City Department of Education and was the founding principal of the award winning High School of Economics and Finance, the first high school of its kind in New York City. She was also the Assistant Director of the national program of courses about economics, the Academy of Finance, that has been adopted by more than 400 schools. After retirement, she was a mentor for principals, assistant principals, and teachers, and she led Sanford Weill Institute seminars for high school students. Her gentle wit, wisdom, kindness, charity, and devotion to the arts, cooking, sports and nature will be profoundly missed by her dearly cherished colleagues, students, family, and friends. There will be a memorial service at Trinity Church at Wall Street and Broadway on Monday, October 16 at 10 A.M. Her family requests that contributions be sent to the Susan Ewen Scholarship Fund, WISE, 227 East 56 Street, Suite 201, New York, NY 10022, which will be used to award an annual meritbased scholarship.
