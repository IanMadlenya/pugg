        HEILBUT--Monika, on May 24, 2005 at age 56. Taken from us much too young, Monika was the beloved mother of Lili and friend to so many. Monika was born in Ravensburg, Germany on June 4, 1948 and became a U.S. citizen in 1975. She was an accomplished gymnast and was a judge in the Olympic Games in 1984. She taught at the Chapin School in New York and worked most recently at Synapse Group, Inc., a division of Time Warner. Monika was loved for her quick wit, her effervescent smile and her irrepressible spirit. Never one to suffer fools, she also loved museums, great shows and opera, fine dining and her only daughter most of all. We mourn her loss. She is survived by her mother Elli Volkmann, sisters, Regine and Susanne, and brothers, Peter and Uli, all of whom remain in Germany. Monika's wake will be held at the Bouton Funeral Home in Georgetown, CT from 7-9 PM on today, May 27. Funeral services will be at the Bethlehem Lutheran Church in Georgetown, CT on Saturday, May 28, at 11 AM. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Lili Heilbut Education Fund, C/O Michael Loeb at Synapse, 4 High Ridge Park, Stamford, CT. 06905.
        HEILBUT--Monika (born Volkmann) June 4, 1948. Our deep sorrow--her daughter, Elisabeth Heilbut, her mother, Elli Volkmann, her sisters, Regine and Susanne, her brothers, Peter and Uli, and their children and German friends. Ravensburg, Munchen, Berlin.
