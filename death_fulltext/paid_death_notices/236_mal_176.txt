        RUBINFELD--Chaim. The rabbis, officers, trustees, and members of Congregation Adereth El mourn the loss of our congregant and friend, Chaim Rubinfeld. Chaim was devoted to our synagogue, serving as Gabbai, officer, trustee, and caterer. We will miss his devotion and his friendship. We offer our deepest condolences to Yona, and to the entire Rubinfeld and Cohen families. Alan Koffler & Stuart Krause Co-presidents
