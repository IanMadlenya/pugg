        MARSHALL-Geoffrey. The faculty, staff and students of The Graduate Center of The City University of New York are profoundly saddened by the loss of Geoffrey Marshall, our former Provost and Senior Vice President. For his 13 years at The Graduate Center, first as Associate Provost and then as Provost, he will be remembered as a gentle and wise person, a champion of academic excellence, ever graceful and gracious. A man of unquestionable integrity, Geoffrey Marshall's many contributions to The Graduate Center, including the role he played in the planning of our new home, will be everlasting. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Mary, and family. Frances Degen Horowitz President
