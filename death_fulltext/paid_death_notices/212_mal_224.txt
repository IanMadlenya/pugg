        LAWRENCE--Robert L. The West Point Society of New York mourns with profound sadness the passing of our former president and longtime beloved member of our Board of Governors. Bob's wit and candor combined with limitless energy made him unique among even his West Point brethren. To the end he was devoted completely to his Alma Mater and represented all of the best qualities that exemplified membership in the Long Gray Line. Our deepest sympathy to his family.
