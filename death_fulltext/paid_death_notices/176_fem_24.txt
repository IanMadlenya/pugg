        ARONOWITZ-Linda. It is with deep sorrow that the family of Linda Greenstein Aronowitz announce her passing on September 3, 2001. Linda will be greatly missed by her devoted husband, Joel, her beloved daughters Susanne and Pamela, her son-in-law Robert as well as her niece Elissa, nephew Mark and his wife Barbara. A graduate of the University of Michigan, Linda was a true inspiration to all who knew her. In her six-year battle with cancer, Linda fought with tremendous courage and great spirit. She never lost sight of her goal-to continue to live her life to the fullest potential despite the obstacles that were put in her path. Linda was a true friend and confidant to all whom she encountered. She never missed a birthday, special event, or her Thursday night Mahjong game. Linda always had a smile, was the first to offer assistance, and made all her friends and family members feel as though they were truly special. Linda's knack for entertaining, combined with her sincere thoughtfulness, always left people feeling good about themselves and grateful to have her in their lives. Linda was a dedicated member of Temple Sholom in River Edge, New Jersey where she served on many committees over the past twenty-five years. Her sincere and direct approach to life offered those around her the opportunity to learn from her. Linda's great wit, sense of style, pragmatic approach to the daily conflicts of life, ready smile, thoughtful note, and most importantly, her courage to face strife head-on without looking back is how she will be remembered. Though Linda is now at peace in the arms of her mother Sarah, father Alex and brother Larry, there will always be something special that lives on in each of us who knew and loved her, and that something special is Linda. Services will be held 1PM Wednesday at Louis Suburban Chapel, 13-01 Broadway, Fairlawn, NJ. Donations can be made to Temple Sholom, 385 Howland Avenue, River Edge, NJ 07661.
