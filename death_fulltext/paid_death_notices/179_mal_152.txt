        GAUTHIER-Wendell. December 11. We mourn the passing of a dear friend and confidant. Wendell was a great human being who was both compassionate and understanding, and will be terribly missed by all those who knew and respected him. He was one of the great pioneers and a true leader in the field of law. We extend our sincere sympathy on this great loss to his wonderful wife Ann and his three beautiful daughters. Stan and Susan Chesley and All Your Dear Friends at Waite, Schneider, Bayless & Chesley Co., L.P.A.
