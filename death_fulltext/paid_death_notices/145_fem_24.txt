        McKENNA-Florence. With great sadness and fond memories, we mourn the sudden loss of a good friend, a much appreciated and respected colleague and a very special person. Florence spent her entire career, spanning four decades, at Bristol-Myers Squibb. For most of it, with extraordinary skill and sensitivity, she served in the Office of the Chairman and CEO as director of administration. We admired her loyalty and dedication, but, most of all, we will miss her wit, her wisdom, her friendship, her strongly-held beliefs and the manner in which she helped all those who sought assistance or advice. She gave of herself to the people with whom she worked, and for many, became a close and cherished friend. Florence is survived by her husband Edward, her mother Florence Carroll, two brothers, Matthew and Joseph, her sister-in-law and her nieces and nephews. Our sincerest condolences to all who loved her and remember her. We will miss her deeply. Services Friday, February 5 at 10 A.M., St. Patrick's Roman Cathlic Church, Main Road, Southold, NY. In lieu of flowers, donations in her name may be made to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center or The Leukemia Society. The employees of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company
