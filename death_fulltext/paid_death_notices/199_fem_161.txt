        MILLER--Pearl C. With deep sorrow, the Cohen family announces the sudden passing of our beloved Pearl on August 28, 2003. As the ''First Lady'' of Tranquillity Camp, she was beloved by the countless children whose lives she changed forever. Services will be held on Sunday, August 31, 2003, 11 AM at Schwartz Brothers - Jeffer Memorial Chapels, 114-03 Queens Blvd, Forest Hills, NY.
        MILLER--Pearl C. The Tranquillity Alumni mourns the passing, and celebrates the life of our Pearl, a rock and a profound influence on children and adults for nearly a century. Pearl taught generations of children the lessons of Tranquillity Camp as originally articulated by her beloved Uncle and our founder, Elias A. Cohen. We were taught to be good people, good Americans and to share our good fortunes in the spirit of Noblesse Oblige. Together with husband Henry, she devoted her life to nourishing the lives of tens of thousands of people. In tribute to her life we pledge to keep her dream alive. Our sympathies to the Cohen family, and to Pearl's extended family throughout the world. The Tranquillity Alumni
        MILLER--Pearl Cohn. We are deeply saddened by the passing of our esteemed and beloved cousin, with whom we have had a close and intimate relationship for over half a century, both personally and philanthropically. She will be greatly missed but will never be forgotten. The Schlang Family
