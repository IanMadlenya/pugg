        ZERKOWITZ-Peter. Age 91. On February 5, 2003. A Hungarian war hero who worked for the Resistance in World War II and fought against the communists, Peter emigrated to the U.S. in 1949. Described as a Renaissance man, he possessed a keen intellect and was knowledgeable on a world of subjects. Peter was a generous patron of the arts, compassionate humanitarian, devoted bridge player who will be missed by his longtime partners, and fine organist and remarkable musician. Cherished companion for 39 years of Ilona Katonah and loving second father to Peg Lehman and John Katonah, and beloved uncle of Kristof, Ferenc, Tamas, and Babszi Zerkowitz and their families in Budapest, Hungary and Maria Zankowits and her family in the U.S. We will miss the strength of his spirit and his caring presence in our lives.
