        VON SONNENBURG -Hubert. The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn deeply the loss of longtime colleague and friend Hubert von Sonnenburg, who was the Sherman Fairchild Chairman of Paintings Conservation and one of the world's preeminent conservators. Over his many years at the Museum, from 1959 to 1974 as a conservator, and returning to the Metropolitan in 1991 as chairman of his department, Dr. von Sonnenburg brilliantly accomplished the conservation and cleaning of some of the most beloved masterpieces of the Metropolitan's collection, including Rembrandt's ''Aristotle with a Bust of Homer'' and Velazquez's ''Juan de Pareja.'' He was extraordinarily generous as a teacher and colleague, and shared his expertise in conservation, analysis and authentication with museums, and art institutions around the world. As a result of his remarkable talent in treating many of the great works by Raphael, Rubens, Manet, Rembrandt, Vermeer, and others, museum-goers will continue to be able to study and enjoy the grandeur of these masterpieces for generations to come.
