        HERRMANN - Marjorie. Marty was a cherished and influential member of the Mount Sinai Auxiliary Board for 55 years. Her sensitive and unstinting concern for the individual patient and his family helped guide our deliberations and activities to enhance patient care services. Marty's droll sense of humor was legendary. She used her wit and her charm to make our celebrations memorable, but also to remind us of our common humanity. We were fortunate to have had her counsel and her company for the past half century. We extend our deepest sympathy to her loving family. The Mount Sinai Auxiliary Board
