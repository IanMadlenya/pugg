        EWY--Bradley J. The staff of The Corkery Group mourn the passing of our colleague and friend, Brad Ewy on September 11, 2003. Deeply committed to his work and to the cause of HIV prevention, Brad was instrumental in building support for national efforts to stop the disease's spread. He was an inspiration and mentor to all of us. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his parents, Harold and Joan Ewy of Sunrise Beach, MO, his sisters, Chris Simon, Cindy Thompson and Laura Davis, and his fiancee Tiffany Woolf. Memorial service will be held at a later date. In honor of his work, his family requests that donations be made to WhitmanWalker Clinic in Washington, D.C. (www.wwc.org).
