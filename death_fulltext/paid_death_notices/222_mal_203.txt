        STANLEY--Charles J., AKA Carlo Pittore. My dearest brother lived his life as he chose...to be a true and honest artist. He lived his life to its fullest--just not long enough. His wish was for all to appreciate his art. It was what he worked for and lived for. Art was his life. His inspiration came from not only learning from the masters, but from teaching his students. I shall remember my brother for his love of life, his true gratefulness for life, his art, and the wonderful love that he gave to his family and friends. Rest in peace, my dear brother. With love forever, Marion and Elliott
