        ROSSINI-Julius. 72, Deceased February 6. Adoring husband of Margaret, loving father to Kim, Ralph, & son-in-law Joel, faithful brother to Lou and Delia, and phenomenal grandfather to Michael and Daniel. Jules, known throughout the publishing world as a marketing guru, began his successful career in the 1960's at Western Publishing where he created The Betty Crocker Recipe Card collection, and Wonderful World of Walt Disney Library. His string of successes continued through the 1960's at Random House and Simon & Schuster. In the 80's, he founded Rossini Publishing, creating supermarket-continuity programs for Bantam books including the Walt Disney Fun-To-Learn & Fun-to Read series, Mickey's Young Readers Series, and Sesame Street Early-Learning Card Series. Working with Lynx Publication, he conceived Raggdy Ann & Andy's Grow-and-Learn Library. One or more of these series has been, or still can be found in one out of every five homes in America. He will be dearly missed by family and friends, especially for his unique way of viewing the world. We have lost a truly creative spirit, an honorable man, and the core of our family. May he rest forever in heavenly peace.
