        KLEIN-Arthur L. Sound Shore Medical Center of Westchester deeply mourns the passing of Dr. Arthur Luce Klein. A wise, generous and courageous man, Dr. Klein graced the Medical Center with his presence and support. We who were privileged to know him will always treasure the memories of his kindness to everyone he encountered, his brilliant ability to infuse common language with eloquence, his endurance of pain with humor and dignity. His spirit will remain with all of us, and his benevolence will continue to benefit the patients served in The SSMC Arthur and Luce Klein Renal Dialysis Center, Antepartum Testing Laboratory, Level II Nursery and Geriatric In Patient Unit. Go gentle into that good night, dear friend, and rest in peace. We extend our deepest sympathy to Luce, his wife of fifty years and their children Judith, Joel and Rosine. Clark E. Walter, Chairman Board of Governors John R. Spicer, President and Chief Executive Officer Sound Shore Medical Center of Westchester
