        LEIBOWITZ-Nehama. Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun & Ramaz School mourn the passing in Jerusalem of the peerless Bible teacher of our generation. Tens of thousands of students, including our own, have been enriched by her knowledge, wisdom and methodology. She left no one to sit shiva for her-and yet we are all her bereaved family. Through her words and teachings she will live eternally. Rabbi Haskel Lookstein Fred Distenfeld, President Kehilath Jeshurun Steven R. Gross Chairman, Board of Trustees Ramaz School
