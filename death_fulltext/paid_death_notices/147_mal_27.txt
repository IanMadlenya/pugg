        BRY-Richard John, 1914-1999. Harvard Class of '35, decorated member of the Signal Corps (Okinawa). Adored husband of Betty and honored father of Ellen, William and John. Dick was a published author, creative chef and textiles executive. We will miss his wry wit, his green thumb and his love of a good book. Dick leaves behind a loving legacy in Tracy, John, Spencer, Hannah, Max, Sam, Lily and Oliver. And a last, loving thought from Betty-Our love was so complete, and at the last moment of holding you close to me I felt your being become part of me; you would remain within and part of me always and forever-never apart again.
