        HANIGSBERG--Oscar. Died in Los Angeles on the 15th of April 2006 a few days short of his 93rd birthday. Beloved father of Nina Richmond, William Hanigsberg, and Eric Hanigsberg (deceased); father-in-law of JoAnn Barlow Hanigsberg; grandfather to Julia Hanigsberg and Erica Katzen; proud great-grandfather of Rachel, Leah, and Max Sossin, and affectionate comrade of Julia's husband Lorne Sossin, Oscar was predeceased by Isabelle, the wife he adored and deeply missed. He was a lover of young people, art, music, Yiddish and tennis. Oscar possessed a goodness that enabled him to find the best in people as well as the ability to manage the technicalities of life (including professional life) in the interests of justice which he revered. He was able to look beyond the details--of parenthood, business, friendship--to ask what is right. For this rare sensibility he was beloved and valued and because of it he will be missed by many people. We who survive are challenged and improved by the example he set for us. Friends may gather on Monday April 24 from 11:00 AM to 12:30 PM at ''The Riverside'', 76th St. and Amsterdam Ave. Private burial at Mount Ararat Cemetery. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to CCNY.
