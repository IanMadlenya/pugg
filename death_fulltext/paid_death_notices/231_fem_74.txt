        SELIG--Martha K. The Columbia University School of Social Work notes with great sadness the death of Martha K. Selig, a 1939 graduate whose commitment and creative leadership in professional social work training and Jewish communal services inspired and advanced the continuing excellence of the School, the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, and the UJA-Federation network. A major force in the colaboration of JBFCS and the School in its Center for Social Work Practice, she helped strengthen vitally important links between practice and research. A former member of the School's Advisory Council, part time lecturer and esteemed alumna, her accomplishments will be long remembered. Our sincerest sympathies are expressed to her daughters, Judith, Elaine, & their families. Jeanette C. Takamura, Dean
