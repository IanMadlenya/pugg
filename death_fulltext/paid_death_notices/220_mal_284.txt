        TYLER--Harold R. We are profoundly saddened at the passing on May 25 of our sole surviving name partner, the Honorable Harold R. Tyler. Judge Tyler was a partner with the firm from 1977 to 1991 and Of Counsel from 1992 until his death. Judge Tyler's distinguished career prior to joining the firm included service as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Southern District of New York from 1953 to 1955 and as U.S. Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department from 1960 to 1961. He was appointed as a federal judge in the Southern District of New York by President John F. Kennedy in 1962 and served on the federal bench until 1975, when he was appointed Deputy Attorney General of the United States. When he joined the firm of Patterson, Belknap & Webb in 1977, its name was changed to Patterson, Belknap, Webb & Tyler. Judge Tyler brought distinction to the firm every day, and we will miss his presence sorely. We join his many friends in sending our deepest condolences to his family. All of Us at Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler
