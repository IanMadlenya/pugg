        BAY-Adela. We join the friends of this remarkable woman in paying tribute to her long life and accomplishments. A concert pianist and sister of famed piano virtuoso, Emanuel Bay, she made a new life for herself as a teacher and a writer in New York after surviving the Holocaust in the Vilna Ghetto and labor camps. We extend our sympathy to her nieces. Sedlis Family
