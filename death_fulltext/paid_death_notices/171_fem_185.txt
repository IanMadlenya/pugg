        STEIN-Bessie. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) express profound sorrow at the passing of Bessie Stein of Miami Beach and Philadelphia, a generous and dedicated supporter of the Technion along with her late husband Louis Stein. As champions of the ATS, the Technion and Israel, the Steins attained Technion Guardian status, reaching the highest level of commitment. They established the Louis Stein Food Engineering and Biotechnology Building, and helped fund other projects including the Eve Topf Neurodegenerative Disease Research and Teaching Center of Excellence and the Sam and Eve Topf/Miami Dormitory. We extend our heartfelt condolences to her daughters Marilyn Bellet, a member of the ATS National Board of Directors, Audrey Merves, Ruth Nathanson, and the entire Stein Family.
