        SCHWARTZ-Joseph. The leadership of EMUNAH of America mourns the loss of Joseph Schwartz, beloved father of our Honorary National President, Sondra H. Fisch. Joseph's devotion to EMUNAH's children in Israel was exemplary and continues in the dedicated work of his wife, Florence, and daughters, Sondra, Susan Black, Andrea Sanders and Barbara Segall whom we feel so close to. May the family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Sylvia Schonfeld, National President
