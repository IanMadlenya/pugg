        GOLDMAN--Eugene. The Dysautonomia Foundation deeply mourns the passing of Eugene Goldman. A kind and gentle man, Gene was a strong supporter of the Foundation's work to advance research and medical care for familial dysautonomia (FD). We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Marion Rolnick Goldman, his children Laurie and Jeffrey Goldberger, Pamela and Danny Fried, and Michael, and his grandchildren Perry, Sydney, Cody, Kyle, Jared and Jamie. He will truly be missed.
