        LEEDS-Sylvia S. Died August 16, 2001. Cherished and loving wife of Charles Leeds and last surviving child of Morris and Sadie Smith, a succesful coutourier on lower 2nd Avenue until the 1920s. Sylvia graduated as an English major from Hunter College in 1933, but, because of the depression was unable to start her career as a teacher of English until 1937 at Manhattan Vocational High School. After her first husband, Stanley Feldman, died at 40, she was responsible for the care of Theodore, their son, at a time when facilities for people with disabilities were exclusively institutional. When ultimately Teddy was accepted by the Young Adult Institute into their expanding programs, she became president of its Family Association and a trustee of the New York League for Early Learning. In her leisure she was an avid reader and devoted to movies, theater, travel, good conversation and intensive friendships. Her philosophy was always to strive, to seek, to find and not to yield. There will be a service for Sylvia on Tuesday, August 21, 2:15 PM, at ''The Riverside,'' 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, New York, NY.
        LEEDS-Sylvia. The Board of Trustees, Family Association, staff and consumers of YAI/National Institute for People with Disabilities notes with great sadness the passing of Sylvia Leeds. For over three decades she was a passionate and compassionate advocate for the establishment of services for individuals with developmental disabilities. As the President of the YAI Family Association for 25 years, she counseled family members, offered friendship, support, inspiration and hope. She will be greatly missed. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to her husband Charles, her son Theodore and to her entire family. Marcella Fava, Chairman Dr. Paul H. Levitz, Vice Chairman Board of Trustees Dr. Joel M.
