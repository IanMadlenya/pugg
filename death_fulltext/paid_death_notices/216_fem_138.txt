        HINRICHSEN -- Evelyn. A friend and client. As head of C.F. Peters, classical music publisher, she continued the commitment to contemporary music of her husband Walter, who died in 1969. She was a kind and generous friend and inspiration to composers, musicians and staff. Our condolences to Martha, Henry and family. American Express Tax and Business Services
