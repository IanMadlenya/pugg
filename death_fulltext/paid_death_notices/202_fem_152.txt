        BIDWELL--Katharine O'Neil. The Board of Directors, artists and staff of The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center are deeply saddened by the loss of Katharine O'Neil Bidwell, member of the Board since 1996, founder of our Patrons Program and the moving force behind a commissioning fund for new chamber music. Katharine was a charismatic and tireless champion of the arts. For her, nothing was impossible, and she inspired all of us who worked with her to greater efforts and acommplishments. All of her endeavors were marked by her personal elegance, grace and good humor. We will cherish her memory for her indomitable spirit and passionate commitment to chamber music. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to her husband, J. Truman Bidwell, and her family. Donaldson C. Pillsbury, Chairman Peter Frelinghuysen, President David Shifrin, Artistic Director Norma Hurlburt, Executive Director
