        WINTHROP-Robert. The officers, Board of Directors and members of Ducks Unlimited, Inc. mourn the passing of Robert Winthrop who served as National President of our organization in 1955 and 1956, and as National Trustee Emeritus until the present. His dedication and commitment to the plight of migratory waterfowl across the North American continent was inspirational and he will be sorely missed by the conservation and sportsman communities.
