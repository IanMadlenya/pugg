        MANN--Rabbi Jacob. The Yeshiva University family is saddened by the passing in Israel of a distinguished and dedicated rabbinic leader who served 62 of his 70 years in the rabbinate as spiritual leader of Beth Israel Synagogue in Quincy, Mass. Revered by all who knew him, he was the beloved father of our alumni: Rabbi Dr. Jonah (and Tirzah) Mann; Rabbi Dr. Abraham Moses Mann (and Joan Ehrlich); Esther (and Chaim) Synder; and a cherished grandfather and greatgrandfather. Together with his late wife, Isabelle, he was a Yeshiva University Guardian who established scholarships at Yeshiva College and Stern College for Women. Following his funeral in Quincy Thursday afternoon, the family will observe Shiva from Friday morning to next Wednesday morning at 14017 69th Road, Kew Garden Hills, New York. May the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel, President Norman Lamm, Chancellor Morry Weiss, Chairman YU Board of Trustees
