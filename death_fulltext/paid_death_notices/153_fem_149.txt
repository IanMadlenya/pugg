        SPROUL-Jodi D. (nee Goldstein). The family and friends of Jodi Sproul sadly report her untimely passing on Friday, October 15, 1999. Jodi's love for all of us will be remembered for all time. We who are closest to her will carry on in the way Jodi would have wanted, with love and mutual respect. Jodi's children Samantha and Morgan, immediate family Ed Sproul, Joseph Goldstein, Susan Parower, the rest of her family and loving close friends will honor her memory by our actions.
        SPROUL-Jodi Goldstein. We mourn the far too early passing of Jodi Goldstein Sproul. Our thoughts are with the daughters she loved so much, Samantha and Morgan, and with her sister Susan and her father Joe. Words can not express the enormity of this loss, coupled with that of her mother, Lynn, in such a short span of time. We will always remember Jodi's warmth, integrity and sense of humor. We will remember her as a vivacious young girl and loving mother. We will miss her terribly. Jerry and Sheila Mark and Susanne and Andrew Rosenkranz Wendy and Robert Goldstein
