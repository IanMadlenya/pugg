        KATZ-Eugene. The William Alanson White Psychoanalytic Institute mourns the recent passing of Mr. Eugene Katz. Mr Katz served the White Institute over many decades as an active and vital member of the Board of Trustees. His continued dedication to the mission of the Institute earned him the position of Honorary Trustee, a position which Mr Katz held until the time of his death. Our profound condolences to Mr Katz' devoted family, and to his many friends and colleagues.
