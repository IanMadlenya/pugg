        DESTENAY--Dorianne On February 11, 2006, in Switzerland. Dorianne was born and initially studied in Prague. After emigrating in difficult circumstances postwar, she graduated from the Demoiselles de Decker in Brussels and the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris. She was a well known shoe designer in New York in the 60s. As a painter, she showed at Betty Parsons and the Bodley galleries. Her paintings figure in private and museum collections both in the US and abroad, including the Guggenheim. A devastating studio fire prompted to an additional career in fashion. She joined Chanel in 1981, where she played a pivotal role in launching the company's worldwide ready to wear operations, heading the company's North American fashion operations. After retiring in 1994, Dorianne made Europe her home but traveled often to Coconut Grove and her beloved New York. Dorianne used her impeccable taste to design and decorate the Portes des Iris, one of Switzerland's most prestigious and beautiful conference and banqueting centers. She lovingly restored and embellished the family's ancestral home, its unique clock tower and world famous Jardin des Iris. Dorianne is remembered for her challenging and original mind, complemented by her great beauty, elegance and refinement. Her self discipline and resilience overcame numerous adversities. She is sorely missed by her loving husband, Robert Bovet in Switzerland, her uncle Karel Jirousek in Vancouver, her cousins Ivana and Jindris, and by friends worldwide, who valued her heart, directness, and discernment. The family thanks the thoracic department at MSKCC in New York -to which support should be directed -Clinique Genolier and the esteemed advisors, who worked selflessly to prolong Dorianne's life. An April gathering of friends is being arranged by email. If without, call 212570-0324.
