        FALK-Pauline. The Board of Directors and Staff of the New York Association for New Americans Inc. (NYANA) mourn the passing of Pauline Falk. Mrs. Falk was a founding member of NYANA and a member of its Board of Directors from 1949-91 when she was elected as an Honorary Member of the Board. We will remember her for her work with Jewish refugees and other displaced persons before and during World War II and, for more than half a century, her commitment to NYANA and its historic core mission of serving refugees in the New York area. We extend our heartfelt condolences to her family. Michael Loeb, President Mark Handelman, Executive V.P.
