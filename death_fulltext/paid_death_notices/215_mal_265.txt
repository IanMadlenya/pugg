        MUENCH -- Frederick, 75 years of quality. Fred went from rooting for the Brooklyn Dodgers and playing stickball in Queens to rooting for the Mets and playing tennis in Douglaston and Weston, FL. His journey took him from Valley Forge Military Academy to the University of Michigan to combat in Korea (1st Lt.) and back to Michigan for his MBA. For 50 years he graced Fire Island with his volleyball playing, parties and Margarita-making skills. He was a romantic and a devoted husband to Rose Mary for 40 years, still patting her on the tush and admiring her legs until the end. A supportive and adoring father to Allison, Katharine and Frederick, whose gifts to them were many: carefree summers at Fire Island, self-assurance and an appreciation of excellence. To J.P., Greg, and Jodi he was a father-inlaw that wanted to drop the in-law, and just be a father. He was a doting grandfather to Jacob, Olivia, Piper and Frederick. He was an expert bridge and poker player. A ribbing from Fred meant that you were ''in.'' He was a quiet soul who spoke up whenever things got too thick. His legacy will be based on his few words and a lot of leading-byexample. He had a wonderful combination of humility, objectivity and loyalty...he will be missed.
