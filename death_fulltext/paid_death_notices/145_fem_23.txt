        KOMAROVSKY-Mirra. The Barnard College community is deeply saddened by the death of Mirra Komarovsky, alumna and distinguished teacher associated with the College for 77 of her 93 years. A living legend to generations of young women, she was never out of touch with their concerns and always ahead of her time in the research that gained her world renowned. She was an elegant woman whose probing intelligence was balanced by warm interest in her students and colleagues. She never really retired, and we shall miss her very much. A memorial gathering will be held at the College at a date to be announced. Judith Shapiro, President Gayle Robinson, Chair Of The Board of Trustees
