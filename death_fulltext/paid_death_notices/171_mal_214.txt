        HYMAN-Jeffry Ross (aka Joey Ramone). Peacefully passed away April 15, 2001. He is survived by his devoted mother Charlotte Lesher, brother Mitchel Lee Hyman (aka Mickey Leigh) and sister-in-law Arlene Hyman. They, along with his family, friends and devoted fans, will remember both personally and musically the joy and happiness he brought to all that knew and saw him. He will always remain in their minds and hearts. Thanks Joey for the inspiration and innovations you provided for so many. A memorial celebration will be announced at a later date.
