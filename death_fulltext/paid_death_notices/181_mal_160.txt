        GIPS-Walter F. Jr. The American Jewish Committee mourns with deepest regret and sadness the death of Walter Gips, an Honorary Vice President, beloved member of our Board of Governors, and Past Treasurer. Since 1951, Walter served AJC in numerous national leadership capacities. He was also active in AJC's Central New Jersey Chapter and was honored in 1991 with its Philip Forman Human Relations Award. Walter was a thoughtful, beneficent man of great warmth and wisdom, who sought to use his gifts for the betterment of Jews the world over, and all people of goodwill. We will sorely miss his contagious love of life, and his friendship. We send our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Ann, his children, Terry, Rob, Don, and Ellen, his grandchildren, and the rest of the grieving family. Harold Tanner, President David A. Harris, Executive Director
