        WEIL--Michael P. Friends and colleagues at the New York City Department of City Planning mourn the untimely passing of Mike Weil. A professional with the utmost integrity and honesty, Mike used his formidable planning, architecture and urban design skills to help shape the city he loved so dearly. As Director of Zoning and Urban Design for the last ten years, one of his greatest achievements was the master plan for the two-mile Greenpoint/ Williamsburg waterfront. All of us at City Planning will miss him greatly. He will be remembered for his candor, commitment, character, sense of humor, talent and creativity.
