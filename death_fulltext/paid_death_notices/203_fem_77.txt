        LIGHTBOWN -- Mary Jane. The staff of the Department of Architecture and Design of The Museum of Modern Art, sadly notes the passing of longtime colleague Mary Jane Lightbown. From 1968 until her retirement in 1984 her research on architecture and design informed the museum's publications, exhibitions and enriched the permanent collection.
        LIGHTBOWN -- MaryJane, was a loyal friend, valued colleague and devoted New Yorker. Her generous heart and optimistic outlook will be missed and always will be remembered with great affection. McQuaid Family Patricia Rice Konyk Family
