        GOODFRIEND -- Marsha Storch. Our sweet Marsha left us on October 7, 2004 after a battle with kidney disease. She was the cherished daughter of Florence Pitkin Storch Greene and the late George R. Storch, dear step-daughter of Albert Greene, loving sister of Michael Storch of Jerusalem, Israel and the late Steven Storch. Her adored daughter Sharon Goodfriend was the light of her life and her greatest joy. Her nieces Yocheved, Beatrice, Yochana, her nephew David, grandniece Talia will remember her loving kindness. Beloved by her many Storch cousins and good friends in Dallas, Texas, where she lived for 35 years. They will miss her intelligent conversation, lively wit, and impeccable taste in all things. She loved to teach, and her knowledge and compassion enhanced the lives and careers of her many students. Our lives will continue missing her every day. Services will be held at 10:30 am, New Montefiore Cemetery on Sunday, October 10, 2004. In lieu of flowers, family requests donations be sent in Marsha's memory to the National Kidney Foundation, 30 E. 33 St., NY, NY 10016 or www.kidney.org
