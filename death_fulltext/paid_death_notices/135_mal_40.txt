        WEYL-Walter. A resident of Kendal at Hanover, N.H. Died on April 1, 1998, at the age of 93. Born in Hamburg, Germany, December 11, 1904, the first child of Michael and Margarete Fahning Weyl. He arrived on Ellis Island in 1923, the day after his 19th birthday and continued his journey to St. Louis, Missouri. In 1926 he married his longtime friend from Hamburg, Kaethe Schwettscher who died shortly after they celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary. He left the midwest in 1930 and took up permanent residence in NYC where he learned the printing trade, ultimately joining the New York Times (the only newspaper he deemed worth reading) retiring as a linotype operator in 1969. He was a lifelong member of the International Typographical Union. He and his wife toured the U.S. extensively both before and after retirement, their particular love being the national parks. Their trips were amply photographed and relived with friends. An introvert by nature he loved to read, listen to his expensive record collection, peruse his photo albums and tackle New York Times crossword puzzles. His skill in word games such as Scrabble and anagrams was unsurpassed. He moved to Hanover, N.H. in 1993 where his only child, Dr. Hilda Weyl Sokol resides. He is survived by two sisters, his daughter, three grandchildren and four great grandchildren. The family will have a private memorial service.
