        GERMAIN--Lawrence. Memories are precious. As time travels on. When you long for a face, and the smile that is gone. It seems like only yesterday, you took me by the hand and there you placed a special ring. A golden wedding band. Together on life's journey. We shared happiness and tears. And I would not trade anything. For all those precious years, I sit alone at evenings and think about our life and all those lovely happy years, we had as man and wife. Your memory is a treasure. With which I will never part. God has you in his keeping. I have you in my heart. Sadly missed by your loving wife. Sheila
