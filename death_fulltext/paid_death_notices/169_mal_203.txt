        LIU-F.T. The Board and Staff of the International Peace Academy mourn the loss of our friend and colleague F.T. Liu. After a distinguished career in the United Nations, he shared with us his experience and insights in the realm of peacekeeping and the search for peaceful resolution of conflicts. We will miss him greatly.
