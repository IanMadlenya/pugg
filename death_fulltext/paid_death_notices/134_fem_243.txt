        BERNARD-Viola. On March 21, 1998. Viola was one of our most distinguished faculty members. She showed us how the sensitivity and subtlety of a clinician could be brought to bear on problems of the public health. Her strong ethical sense, her personal generosity and her caring involvement, even when she was unwell, were examples to us all. We will miss her greatly.
