        GOTTLIEB-Paul. The Board of Directors of the American Friends of the Hermitage Museum wishes to express their gratitude to Paul Gottlieb for his wisdom and generosity toward The State Hermitage Museum. He was an energetic and active member of our board, and a sincere friend and supporter of The State Hermitage Museum. His loss will be deeply felt by The Hermitage Museum and all those who care for it, and who promote American-Russian relations. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to his wife Elisabeth and his family.
