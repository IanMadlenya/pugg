        HURWITZ-Jerome O.D. With profound sorrow, Union Temple of Brooklyn mourns its long time member and Trustee, Dr. Jerome Hurwitz. For over half a century, he devoted his time, energy and love to our congregation, having served as Chairman of Ushers and Chairman of The School of Religion. He was deeply committed to the Union of American Hebrew Congregations and the National Federation of Temple Brotherhoods. Our entire congregation extends its heartfelt sympathy to Hortense, his adoring wife of 54 years, and Honorary President of Union Temple. Our thoughts are also with his children, Sanford and Robert, his daughter-in-law Rhona, and his grand daughter, Jade. Funeral services Sunday, October 11th at 11 A.M. at Union Temple, 17 Eastern Parkway, at the Grand Army Plaza. Rabbi Linda Henry Goodman, Rabbi Dr. A.
