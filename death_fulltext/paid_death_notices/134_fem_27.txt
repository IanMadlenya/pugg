        JACOBUS-Elinor Hughes. Age 91. On February 28 at Brookhaven Memorial Hospital, Patchogue, New York. Wife of the late David D. Jacobus, she is survived by two stepsons, John H. Jacobus of New York City and Dr. David P. Jacobus of Princeton, New Jersey, five grandchildren, four great-grandchildren and two generations of nieces and nephews. Immediately after her graduation from Radcliffe College, under the name of Elinor Hughes, she began her career as a theater critic for the Boston Herald, a position she held for over 40 years. Her reviews, which included film and occasionally music, made her a preeminent voice in Boston and she reviewed hundreds of Broadway bound musicals and dramas. Her encyclopedic knowledge of English and American prose and poetry, especially Shakespeare, and her life-long enthusiasm for the theater made her writing both generous and erudite. Many pieces were collected in her book, ''Passing Through to Broadway''. Interment will be private. In lieu of flowers donations may be made to: The Actors Fund, Radcliffe College, National Wildlife Federation.
