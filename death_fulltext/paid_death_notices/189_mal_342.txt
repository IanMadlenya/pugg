        OBERMAN-Isaac M. ''Ike.'' The employees and staff of The Oberman Companies express our deepest sorrow at the passing of our leader, teacher and friend. As the patriarch of our business family, he was more than just an insurance broker, he was our confidant, our conscience and our true inspiration as a professional. Our deepest sympathies are extended to his wife Regina, to his son Stuart (Paula), his daughters Susan (Herb) and Arlene (Robert), to his grandchildren, great-grandchild and brothers. Ike's smile, bold laugh and bad jokes will be missed by us all. Our sympathy and love go to his friends and family, and all who have been touched by this truly wonderful man.
