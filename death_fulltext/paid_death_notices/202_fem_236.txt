        RUBINI - REICHLIN -- Clarice. On November 28, 2003. Born in Vienna, Austria, March 1, 1912. Long time resident of New York City and Westchester; living in New Jersey for the last twelve years. Left Austria in the early 1930's to follow a theatrical career, which took her all over Europe. While working in cabaret in Czechoslovakia, met and married Albert Wolf, a bridge master, and thereafter immigrated to the U.S. in 1937. When the Nazis invaded Austria in the Spring of 1938 she immediately started to find sponsors to facilitate the immigration of her family to the U.S. Thanks to her efforts most of them escaped the Nazi terror. Her father, aunt, and many others in the family were killed by the Nazis. In the early 1950's she was divorced and thereafter married Mario Rubini-Reichlin, a prominent New York voice teacher which brought her in contact with the world of opera, theater and cantorial music. They resided at Carney Hall (where he maintained his studio) and had a home in Tanglewood. Until his death in 1968 she and Mario were active in the music entertainment scene in New York and Tanglewood and had contacts with Leonard Bernstein, Isaac Stern and many other entertainment figures. Mrs. Rubini-Reichlin was a member of the Cavendish Club, Champions Bridge Club. Her nieces, Jessica Hurley and Allison Ross, as well as a grandniece and two grandnephews, survive her.
