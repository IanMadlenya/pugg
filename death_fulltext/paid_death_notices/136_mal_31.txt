        SLOBADIN-Stephen. The Board of Directors of the Prescott Fund for Children and Youth, Inc. express our profound sorrow on the death of Mr. Stephen Slobadin, our president and colleague. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife Elizabeth Anne and family. For over a half century he dedicated his life on behalf of underprivileged children. The Prescott Neighborhood House, The Prescott Nursery School and The Prescott Fund thrived under his leadership. He set up summer camps and provided tuition assistance to those wished to attend college. He will be greatly missed. Memorial service to follow later. The Board of Directors
