We will miss his wisdom, vision, determination, and charm. All of us here at Wiley extend our condolences to his children and our colleagues, Deborah E. Wiley, Sr. VP, Corporate Communications, and Board member; Peter Booth Wiley, Board member; and Brad Wiley II, Chairman of the Board and Editor. Charles R. Ellis, President and CEO
