        MIRZA--Muzzafar ''Muzzi''. We mourn the loss of our founder, partner and dear friend, Muzzi Mirza. Muzzi was endlessly creative, constantly energized, and a problem solver who always found the way through the most convoluted maze and taught us how to have fun doing it. Muzzi's remarkable warmth and open spirit resulted in a world where once you spent an hour with him you felt as if he was your friend -and he was. For Muzzi, the glass was not merely half full, it was always overflowing. He made us all better at what we do and in who we are. To his wife, Sue, and to his children, Alexander, Christina and Sean, we loved him too, and will miss him dearly. Odyssey Investment Partners
        $(6$)MIRZA--Muzzafar ''Muzzi''. For the past 17 years, Muzzi was my colleague, partner and friend. We taught each other our business. We argued constantly, laughed uproariously, struggled through bad and good times, and in the end worked it out every day. He was a living antidote to pessimism, an enemy to gloom, the champion of keeping our options open and lifting spirits. When we wandered, Muzzi was ''not confused''. I am not confused now, Muzzi. It was very, very special. Stephen Berger
