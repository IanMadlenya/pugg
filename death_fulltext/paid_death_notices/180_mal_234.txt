        KAHN-Hugo. It is with deep sorrow that we report the death of Hugo Kahn, beloved husband of Margie; devoted father of Alan and Danny (Shira), and proud grandfather of Yael and Aliza. Hugo was a founder and benefactor of Youth Centers of Israel Inc., which was very important in streamlining the youngsters in the waves of immigrants that came to Israel. He will be sorely missed.
