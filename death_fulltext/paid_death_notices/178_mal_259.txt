        WHOLEY-Michael. The family of Port Authority Police Officer Michael T. Wholey would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to all the kind and thoughtful people who gave of their time, love and support to us after the loss of Michael in the World Trade Center attack. The many offerings of food, Mass cards, flowers and financial assistance will never be forgotten. A special thanks to those who attended the Memorial Mass for Michael and especially to Fr. Backes and Fr. Jerry Hahn for participating in the Mass in St. Andrews R.C. Church in Westwood, NJ and to the Port Authority NY/NJ for their wonderful support of his wife and children. May God bless you all for your kindness and concern. The Wholey Family
