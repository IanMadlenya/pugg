        ALLEN-Donna. The National Committee Against Repressive Legislation (NCARL) mourns the death of our District of Columbia Vice Chair and long time activist. Donna has given unstintingly of her energy and scholarship over all the years, not only to NCARL and its predecessor, the National Committee to Abolish HUAC, but to the many other causes that were dear to her. She will be sorely missed. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to her family.
