        COHEN--Dr. Carol Ann. The family and friends of Dr. Carol Ann Cohen, originally of Newton, MA mourn her passing as no other. Carol lived with a clarity and honesty that moved us all. Her true homes, Manhattan and Cape Cod Beach, were always open. Her work as a child psychologist was unsurpassed. Her artistic expressions were signature. With Carol, it was always, ''Let's move on''. She leaves behind dear and loving family, friends and colleagues, who forever will live in her light. Services will be held Friday, April 21, at 1:45 P.M. at Sharon Memorial Park, Dedham Street, Sharon, MA. Remembrances to Kerrie Brayman and family, 532 Rookwood Place, Charlottesville, VA 22903.
