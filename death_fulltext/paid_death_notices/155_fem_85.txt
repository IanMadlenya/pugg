        GREENFIELD-Margaret A. The Board of Directors of The Independent Journalism Foundation and the staffs of the Centers for Independent Journalism in Prague, Bratislava, Bucharest and Budapest mourn the loss of our co-founder Margaret A. Greenfield. She directed the building and decoration of our four centers, bringing her keen eye, attention to detail and fine taste to their successful completion. An inveterate traveler, an avid collector of art and a sophisticated follower of world events, she created an efficient and warm environment for learning and training at the centers. She made a significant contribution to hundreds of journalists who are working to build an effective free press in eastern and central Europe.
