        EISENSTEIN-Myron ''Mike''. The community of West End Synagogue is deeply saddened by the loss of this founding member. We extend our condolences to his loving Ruth, his devoted children Jethro, Hester and Paula, to his grandchildren and to all of his family. A quiet, soft-spoken man, Mike was a true scholar with a sunny smile and a fine sense of humor. Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan spoke of the serenity of the soul experienced by those who make God's presence real to others. Mike understood this well. We will miss him greatly.
