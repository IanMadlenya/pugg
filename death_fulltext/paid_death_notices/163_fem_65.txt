        LACKAMP-Judith A. died peacefully on August 4, 2000 in her home. A native of Cleveland, OH, Judy lived in NYC for nearly 40 years. Judy is survived by her brother William A. Lackamp, niece Lori Shoemake and husband James, grandnieces Devon and Emily. She touched our lives in many wonderful ways. She lived her life with grace and dignity.

We all felt good in her presence and blessed to have her in our lives. She will remain lovingly in our hearts forever.
