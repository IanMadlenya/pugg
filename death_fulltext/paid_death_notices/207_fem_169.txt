        WIMPFHEIMER--Hanna S. We extend deepest sympathy to the Wimpfheimer family, and sister Edith Rosenberg. A Silver Founder with her beloved husband Ernst, Putti raised her children Paul, Charles and Lee and lived her life according to the highest values of Jewish tradition and ethics. Her elegant sweet presence will be sorely missed by her children, grandchildren and great grandchildren. May the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
