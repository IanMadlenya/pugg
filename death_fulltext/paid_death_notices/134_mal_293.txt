        GOODMAN-Nena. The directors, trustees, staff, and patients of National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver wish to express our deepest sympathy to the family of Nena Goodman, who passed away March 19. Mrs. Goodman was the widow of Andrew Goodman. Andrew Goodman's father, Edwin, began the Goodman family's decades-long involvement with National Jewish. Andrew Goodman, who passed away in 1993, chaired the National Jewish Council of National Trustees from 1965-1983. The Goodman building at National Jewish was named in his honor. Andrew and Nena Goodman's son, Edwin A. Goodman, is currently a National Jewish trustee. Nena was a most gracious, kind, and generous friend to National Jewish. Robert L. Mettler, Chairman Council of National Trustees Lynn M. Taussig, M.D., President and CEO
