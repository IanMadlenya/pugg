        MANZONI-Carol Berlin. The law offices of Ross & Hardies mourn the passing of our friend and partner Carol Berlin Manzoni. Carol was a prominent labor lawyer and nationally recognized expert in employment discrimination law. She was elected to the firm's Executive Committee from 1992-1998 and was Co-Chairman of the Committee from 1996-1998. We wish to extend our condolences to her husband Michael Hron, stepsons Benjamin & Jonathan and family.
