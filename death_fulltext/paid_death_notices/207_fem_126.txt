        FEIN--Marjorie. We deeply mourn the passing of our dear friend and co-worker. Marj was a dedicated and ardent member of Women's League for Israel for many years during which time she served in many and varied capacities. We loved her and we will always remember her English accent, her sense of humor, her easy laughter and her love for our work on behalf of young people in Israel. We extend our sincere condolences to her family. Harriet Lainer, President
