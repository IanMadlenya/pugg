        TUCK-Edward Hallam. The partners, associates and staff of Shearman & Sterling mourn the death of their distinguished colleague and friend. A visionary, Ed Tuck opened Shearman & Sterling's first overseas office in Paris in 1962. Always at the forefront of international relations and understanding, he was named a Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur by the French government for his role in fostering French American cooperation. Over his illustrious career, he forged countless relationships from around the world that he nurtured throughout his life. His generosity, vitality and panache will be sorely missed. We wish to extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Liliane, and his children and grandchildren.
