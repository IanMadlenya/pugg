        KREFETZ--Gerald S., 73. Of New York City, died January 27. Beloved father of Nadine and Adriene, husband of the late adored Ruth Marossi Krefetz. A noted financial author and consultant, a provocative thinker with a wry sense of humor, Eagle Scout integrity, and a love of nature, he will be sorely missed by relatives and friends at home and abroad.
