        BART-Susan. Our entire community mourns the death of Susan Bart, Mother of Maddy and Josh, and wife of Jack Bart, after a long and courageous struggle. Susan was an exemplary jewish parent, who devoted herself to the wel fare of her family; Susan's commitment to her children's future was always in her thoughts and reflexed in her actions. Never did she cease to care and plan for the needs of Josh and Maddy. Susan was an enthusiatic member of our Parent's Association, tending to the needs of all our children; her quiet graciousness and kindness toward all in our community will always be remembered. We are deeply saddened by Susan's death and offer our comfort to Jack, Josh and Maddy. ''May the Memory of the Righteous be a Blessing''. M.
