        FRIEDMAN-Reginia, M.D. On March 30, 2001. A most dedicated physician, loving, selfless and kind in every aspect of her life; a true woman of valor who was taken too early and tragically. She lived life fully and decently. Life without her is unimaginable. Survived by her sister Esther Friedman, her fiance Paul Nahodyl, aunts, cousins and friends. Predeceased by parents Dora and Abraham Friedman. Sadie and Popeye are searching for her already. She has left her presence with us forever. Services at ''The Riverside,'' 180 West 76th St., on Monday.
