        LEAHEY-Michael I. The Columbia University Department of Surgery mourns the sudden, untimely passing of Michael Leahey. As the founding director of the Office of Clinical Trials at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, Michael understood the fundamental role of clinical trials in the advancement of medical science. He used his background in business to create an office that completed the often onerous administrative tasks associated with clinical trials. He assisted virtually everyone on our faculty over the past decade, as he eased our way through paperwork and allowed us to focus on our clinical research project. Moreover, he managed this complex operation while also pursuing a separate career as the author of several successful novels and directing the Edward B. Leahey, Jr. Foundation. He was a remarkable man who will be missed by all who worked with him. We extend sincere condolences to his wife, Lynn, his two young children, and his entire family. Eric A. Rose, M.D., Chairman Columbia University Department of Surgery, Columbia Prestyterian Medical Center NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital
