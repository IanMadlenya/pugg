        RANDAZZO--Carmine. His senseless loss reminds us that there are no guarantees for a noble life lived. He will live on in three of New York's Finest, Joe, Anthony and Carmine. We know he has taken his place among the mighty in Heaven. We send our love and deepest sympathies to the entire family. Joseph and Erika Ades.
