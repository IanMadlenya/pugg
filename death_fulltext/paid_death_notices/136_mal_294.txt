        RIPOSANU-Pamfil. The Marymount School Board of Trustees, Administration and entire School community mourn the death of our beloved friend, colleague and Trustee Emeritus, Pamfil (Rip) Riposanu. A member of the Board since 1977, he shared his legal expertise and provided strong leadership and generous support. He will be fondly remembered for his love of Marymount and the warmth and wit that he brought to the School. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Marguerite, his daughter, Ann Maria '78, and his entire family. Kathleen Fagan, RSHM, Head Mistress
