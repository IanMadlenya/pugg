        RANDOLPH--Muriel. All of the associates of Randolph Properties in Chappaqua & Katonah, NY, mourn the loss of our President and Founder, Muriel L. Randolph. Her leadership was marked by her strength, integrity, business acumen, humor and the ability to face the world 'head on'. ''Mickey'' was always a source of inspiration for us. We will carry on in the role model she set forth.
