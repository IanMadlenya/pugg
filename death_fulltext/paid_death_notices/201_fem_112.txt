        ZIRINSKY--Nancy S. We mourn the premature passing of our cherished sister and aunt. Nancy was a beautiful woman with a great spirit who always made a valiant effort to overcome more than her share of life's problems. In spite of everything she lived her life with great curiosity, enthusiasm and depth. She did many things, went many places and cared dearly about the people in her life, the welfare of others and the issues of the day. We love her and will miss her enormously. Olga, Hanna, Jacob, and John
