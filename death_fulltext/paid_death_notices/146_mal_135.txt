        COHN-Isidore. ''Tibby'' A friend for all seasons. Close, caring and loyal. Such was Tibby to us, always there at happy times with shared excitement, and at trying times with kind words and encouragement. Always with a ''G-d Bless You.'' His loss creates a huge void that could never be filled. Lilly & Irwin
