        GOLDENBERG-Hyman. The Mesivta of Long Beach marks with sorrow the loss of Mr. Hyman Goldenberg, of Blessed memory, our long time supporter, dear friend and neighbor. His caring ways and desire to always do kindness for others, along with his love and respect for Torah and Jewish education will long be remembered. We will miss him deeply both as a special man and as a representative of a bygone generation. Our heart felt condolences to Mrs. Ruth Gotthelf and family, Mr. Arthur Goldenberg and family, Mrs. Rosalind Alper and Mrs. Anita Goldenberg and family. May all of you be comforted and spared from further sorrow. HaRav Yitzchok Feigelstock Rosh HaYeshiva Rabbi Shlomo Lesin Executive Vice President
