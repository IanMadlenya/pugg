        MILHAUPT-Charles. The Howard Gilman Foundation and the Gilman Paper Company deeply mourn the passing of Charlie Milhaupt, esteemed member of the Foundation's Board of Directors. His expertise in the field of the performing arts, particularly in the realm of film, made him a tireless and passionate advocate for the arts. He was admired by all for his strength and courage in the face of his long battle with illness and cherished for his perpetual loyalty to those he loved, in particular to the late Howard Gilman, his friend and mentor. We fondly remember his graceful wit, his love of understatement and his astute perceptions of what was exceptional and provocative in the arts. He will be deeply missed and we hope our ongoing work will continue to fulfill the promise of his memory. The Directors and Staff of The Howard Gilman Foundation and Gilman Paper Company
