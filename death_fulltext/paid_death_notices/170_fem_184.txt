        LEIKIND-Elena. The members of the Forward Association and the staff of the Forward newspapers mourn the shocking, untimely death of our dear colleague, Elena Leikind. Assistant to editors of the Yiddish Forverts for the past decade, she was a patriot of the Yiddish language and a partisan of the Forward newspapers. A daughter of postwar Jewish Kovne, she moved with her family to a new life in Israel in 1971, and came to the US 12 years later. She brought to her work an engaging affability, fluency in five languages, and a constant concern for the people she worked with. To her dear friend, Stephen Dowling, her parents Israel and Raisa Leikind and sister Jana Goren of Raanana, Israel, and other members of her family in both countries, we convey our condolences. Zol di erd ir gring zayn. Dr. Barnett Zumoff, President Samuel Norich, General Manager
