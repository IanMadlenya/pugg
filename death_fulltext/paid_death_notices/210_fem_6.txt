        STEIN--Marion. The officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Marion Stein, beloved wife of the late of Bernard Stein. Marion and Bernard, deeply devoted leaders of the Jewish community, made a profound impact through their generosity and warmth. Marion's legacy, particularly as a life trustee of the Sarah Neuman Center, the Westchester Division of the Jewish Home and Hospital, continues on through the efforts of her daughter Ellen, past president of the JCC of Mid Westchester. We extend our deepest sympathies to their children: Ellen, and her husband Howard; Robert, and his wife Mara; to their grandchildren; and to the entire family. Morris W. Offit, President Susan K. Stern, Chair of the Board John S. Ruskay, Exec. V.P. & C.E.O.
