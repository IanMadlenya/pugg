        SCHEPPS-Edna. On February 28, 2000, cherished wife of the late Nathaniel Schepps, beloved mother of Jill and Jack Butterly, and John and Janice Schepps, devoted grandmother to Kelly Tedesco and Adam Schepps, adoring great grandmother to Casey & Emily Tedesco. Edna is survived by her sister, Doris Schmidt, dear cousins, Ruth Sherman & Natalie and Steve Gross. Forever young and beautiful, we say goodbye for now to our precious ''Eddy Spaghetti.'' We'll see you in our dreams.
