        HINDS--Dr. Vira C. The Lincoln Hall Board of Managers notes with deep regret the passing of Dr. Vira C. Hinds, who faithfully served on the Board 25 years. Dr. Hinds was the wife of Sydney A. Hinds who is also a member of the Board. Dr. Hinds was Chairperson of the Personnel Committee and served on the Executive and Program Committees. She taught in elementary schools in Jamaica as well as a NYC parochial school. She held a Ph.D. in education from Columbia University Teachers College and became an assistant professor at CCNY. Dr. Hinds was a strong supporter of the disadvantaged youth in our care and demonstrated this advocacy by volunteering to tutor some of our young boys on a weekly basis. She was a cherished member of the Board and the Lincoln Hall family, and will be truly missed. The Board and staff extend sincere condolences to the family on their loss. James G. Nugent, President Douglas W. Wyatt, VP and the Lincoln Hall Board of Managers
