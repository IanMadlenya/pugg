        EILENBERG - Samuel. The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn the passing of Samuel Eilenberg, a longtime friend and Benefactor of the Museum. His generous gift of Indian and Southeast Asian works of art from a superb collection that he amassed over decades has greatly enhanced The Metropolitan's collections and will endure in the galleries for a grateful public.
