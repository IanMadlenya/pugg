        HEIMAN-Dr. Silvia. Died peacefully Thursday, December 4, in her 88th year. Born in 1910 in the Austro-Hungarian empire, she earned her M.D. degree in Vienna in 1936. Along with her husband, the late Dr. Marcel Heiman, she left Vienna in 1938, eventually settling in New York in 1944. She began a psychotherapy practice in 1950 that continued until one year ago. She was an unfailing source of care, support, and advice to patients, friends, and family, particularly Peter, Marsha, Mark, and Erica Heiman. A memorial will take place at a later date.
