        GOLDING-Judge Elizabeth Bass. The Board of Directors, staff, parents and students of the The Hebrew Academy of Nassau County (HANC) mourn the loss on Tuesday, January 30, of longtime friend, supporter, benefactor and honorary member of the HANC Board of Directors, Judge Elizabeth Bass Golding-LEYAH BAT VELVL. A longtime judge in Nassau County, Judge Elizabeth Bass Golding was one of the first women admitted to practice law in New York State in the early 1920's. A leading jurist, and confidante of Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt, Judge Golding was head of the Democratic ticket in Nassau County in 1940. Judge Elizabeth Bass Golding was a full partner with her late husband, Samuel Golding in supporting the educational needs of tens of thousands of students at the Hebrew Academy of Nassau County. Their generous support helped bring to fruition the dream of a HANC elementary and nursery school in the West Hempstead community-the ''Samuel and Elizabeth Bass Golding Elementary School'' and the ''Samuel and Elizabeth Bass Golding Early Childhood Center''. The blessed memory of Judge Elizabeth Bass Golding will forever remain in the hearts of us all and will be carried on through the children of the Hebrew Academy of Nassau County. Contributions in her memory can be made to HANC, 240 Hempstead Ave., West Hempstead, NY 11552. Rabbi Moshe Gottesman, Dean Miriam Lieber, Administrator Warren Feierstein, Director of Development Harvey Liebman, President Isaac Blachor, Chairman, Board of Directors
