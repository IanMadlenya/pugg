        POULAKAKOS--Adrienne M. February 24, 1934-August 4, 2003. Beloved wife of Harry and mother of Peter passed from this life peacefully on August 4, 2003 after a short illness. Adrienne, who was the second child and only daughter of Alfred and Mary Alice Nahas, was born on February 24, 1934 in Brooklyn, New York. She married Harry Poulakakos on June 6, 1965. Together they built a life and lived in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, New York. They were blessed with a son, Peter, who was born on April 21, 1976. Adrienne lived life to its fullest and with her husband and later her son, helped to build a successful restaurant enterprise in the Wall Street area of Manhattan. She will be remembered as a pillar of the social, economic and philanthropic community of lower Manhattan through her family's restaurants, most notably Harry's at Hanover Square, Harry's at the American Exchange and most recently Bayard's. The generosity and care she bestowed upon those she served in her life's work will be most missed by those who knew her.

She also leaves her brotherin-law, George Poulakakos and his wife Despina also of Brooklyn, New York, sistersin-law Angelique & Catherine, numerous nieces and nephews and many other family members and friends.
