        RE--Honorable Edward D. The Board of Trustees and members of The Historical Society of the United States Court of International Trade note with sorrow the passing of the Honorable Edward D. Re, Chief Judge Emeritus of the United States Court of International Trade. Judge Re was recognized for his integrity, fairness and clarity of decisions by practitioners before the Court. The history of the United States Court of International Trade will forever be tied to his vision and tireless efforts, which led to the enactment of the Customs Courts Act of 1980 and brought expanded jurisdiction, increased remedies and greater access to judicial review to litigants seeking the peaceful resolution of customs and international trade disputes. We extend our condolences to Judge Re's wife, Margaret, and to the entire Re family.
