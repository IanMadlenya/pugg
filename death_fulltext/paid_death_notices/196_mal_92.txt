        FREDA-Vincent J. M.D. The faculty, staff, and students of Columbia University Health Sciences mourn the passing of a highly esteemed and accomplished mentor, colleague, and friend, Dr. Vincent J. Freda. Dr. Freda has been a member of the Columbia community for over five decades, first as a student in the 1940s and then as a respected member of the teaching faculty from the 1960s to the 1990s. Dr. Freda's contributions to the fields of obstetrics and maternal-fetal medicine are both numerous and far-reaching, and have helped to save thousands of lives throughout the world. Dr. Freda led the research team that developed Rhogam, the antibody that enables women with Rh-negative blood to deliver healthy Rhpositive babies. In 1959, he became the first doctor in the United States to perform amniocentesis; five years later, he was the first in the world to perform surgery on a fetus. The 1980 Albert Lasker Clinical Medical Research Award winner for his discovery of Rhogam, Dr. Freda was named clinical professor emeritus of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia and honored with a fellowship in his name for perinatalogy research in 2000. In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to the Vincent Freda Fellowship Fund in Perinatalogy at the Sloane Hospital for Women (c/o Chairman, Department of OB/GYN, 622 W. 168th St., 16th Floor, New York, NY 10032). We extend our most heartfelt sympathies to his wife, Carol Ury, his daughter Pamela, his two sons, Andrew and Bradley, and his three grandchildren. He will be missed by all who knew him. Gerald D. Fischbach, M.D. Executive Vice President for Health and Biomedical Sciences Dean, Faculties of Medicine and Health Sciences, Columbia University Mary D'Alton, M.B.B.C.h.
