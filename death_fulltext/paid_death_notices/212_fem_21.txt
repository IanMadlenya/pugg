        TIERNEY--Loren. The Department of Medicine and the NYU/Bellevue Pulmonary Division sadly announce the passing of Loren Tierney, M.D. She served as Chief Medical Resident, Pulmonary Fellow, and Clinical Instructor at NYU/Bellevue for 13 years. She was revered by her patients and widely respected by her peers. She was the rare individual who succeeded in happily combining superb medical care and community and family service. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to her family. William N. Rom, M.D. Director, Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine NYU School of Medicine Martin J.
