        HAGHIGHI--Houchang, December 18, 1938 -March 2, 2007. A great man, an unparalleled father and an amazing husband, Houchang came to America in search of a better life and left this world having bettered the lives of all those who knew him. His family and helping those who were without was his life's passion and true labor -a labor the fruits of which won't be fully appreciated for generations and generations. A great man passed away and no one knew; there were no news alerts, parades or holidays in his honor but make no mistake -he was great. His true labor will be carried on by his family and loved ones as he watches over from a better place. Rest in peace, Dad. Amen.
