        SCHIFF-Stuart. Amy and I will miss you terribly. We worked closely together for 14 years and we enjoyed a lasting friendship for an additional 12 years. We grieve for Barbara and for Stephen and we will always fondly reflect smilingly on the hundreds of times we spent laughing together over those 26 years. Doodles, it's hard to believe that you are really gone; and I hope that if you happen to run into Eddie, that you will remind him that he still owes us money. With all of our love, Amy and Ronnie Goldberger
