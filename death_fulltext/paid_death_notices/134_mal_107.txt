        BERSON-Harold. It is with great sadness that we extend our condolences to our Partner and Friend, Barry Berson, his wife Roni, his mother Marion and his sister and brother-in-law Mindy and Sandy on the loss of their beloved husband and father. Harold Berson was a man of uncommon grace, wisdom, charm and genuine warmth. It was a privilege to have known him. We feel enriched that he touched our lives.
