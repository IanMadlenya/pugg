        MEEK-Priscilla McKnight, 99, died June 6, 1999, of natural causes. Born August 15, 1899, Mrs. Meek not only watched but participated in some of the world-changing events of the last century. As head of the Greenwich, CT, Foreign Relief Committee during World War II, she spearheaded the effort to send thousands of tons of clothing and medical supplies in the famous Bundles for Britain war effort. She also was an active member of the Red Cross Motor Corps of Greenwich during the war and showed great compassion toward those less fortunate with her efforts over the course of 30 years as a member of the Refugee Committee of Christ Church. Through her work, hundreds of refugees were housed and employed. Born in 1899 in Stonington, CT, to Ormesby McKnight and Elizabeth Philips Mitchel, she married Samuel Williams Meek, who would become an advertising legend, on October 14, 1921. Mr. Meek, a Vice President at the J. Walter Thompson Company, oversaw a huge 39-year foreign expansion at the company, with Mrs. Meek beside him all the way. After years abroad with JWT, they settled in Greenwich, where Mrs. Meek continued her passion for good works and the outdoors, becoming a grand dame of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine and an active member of the Audubon Society. Her husband, who died in 1981, served on the board of the Connecticut Bank & Trust Company and was elected to the Advertising Hall of Fame. Mrs. Meek is survived by three daughters, a son, 17 grandchildren and 30 great-grandchildren. Her life will be celebrated in July with a memorial service to be held at Christ Church in Greenwich. Donations in her memory should be made to The Nature Conservancy, 1815 N. Lynn St., Arlington, VA 22209; or the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Amsterdam Avenue, New York, New York.
