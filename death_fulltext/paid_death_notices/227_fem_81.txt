        NEVLER--Leona. On December 10, 2005. Suddenly, she left a love that was spread through a family and beyond. She was the dear mother of Ellen and Michael Silberman and their spouses Brian Baron and Emily Eldridge, and devoted grandmother of Sophie, Eli, Ethan and Jacob. With the same gentleness and understanding with which she guided the young of her family, she helped writers become authors over her 50 years as one of the first women in publishing. Smart and elegant, she loved good food, stylish clothes and a good turn of phrase. Generous (to a fault) to her family, she is deeply missed by her sister Alberta N. Grossman, brother-in-law Lawrence K. Grossman, nieces Susan Grossman, Jenny Peltz and Caroline Grossman, and their husbands, Sanford Cohen, Andrew Peltz and Andrew Greene, and her six grandnieces and nephews: Rebecca, Ben, Hilary, Allyson, Sarah and Jeremy. Service Tuesday, December 13, 1:30 pm, at Frank E. Campbell, Madison Ave at 81st St.
