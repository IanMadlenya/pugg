        CIFU--Robert, MD. The William Alanson White Psychoanalytic Institute and Society deeply mourn the passing of a distinguished and beloved member and colleague. Bob was a brilliant clinician and teacher who, as Psychiatristin-Chief, left an impressive legacy for which we are profoundly grateful. Dr. Cifu had particular expertise in work with adolesence but he was a true scholar of many subjects covering vast areas. He gladdened his many friends and he took inestimable joy in his adoring family. Our sincere condolences to all who feel this great loss.
