        TWERSKY-Rabbi Dr. Yitzhak. The Students, Faculty and Directors of Maimonides School of Brookline, Ma., mourn the passing of Rabbi Dr. Yitzhak Twersky, zt''l, teacher, Rebbe and role model. Rabbi Twersky's scholarship and righteousness, his devotion to Jewish learning and the Jewish people, inspired and uplifted our community. He guided and enriched our school, fostering the teachings and philosphy of his father-in-law, Rabbi Dr. Joseph Soloveitchik, zt''l, revered Founder of Maimonides School. We extend our deepest condolences to Rabbi Twersky's beloved wife Atarah, Chair of the Maimonides School Committee, and their children and grandchildren. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
