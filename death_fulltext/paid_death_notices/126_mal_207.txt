        SCHAAD-John Thomas. Of Old Tappan, N.J. on July 11, 1997. Beloved husband of Joan (nee Perry). Loving father of Nancy Marie, Gloria May and Lorraine Marian. Devoted and cherished grandfather of Christopher Daniel. Before retiring in 1992, Mr. Schaad was employed by The New York Times. A U.S. Army vet 1951-1953. A private service was held. His love and laughter will be greatly missed. God saw you getting tired and the cure was not to be; so He put his arm around you and whispered, ''Come with Me''. With tearful eyes I watched you and saw you pass away although I loved you dearly I could not make you stay. A golden heart stopped beating, hardworking hands at rest, God broke my heart to prove to me He only takes the best. Memorial gifts to the American Cancer Society.
