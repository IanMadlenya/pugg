        JACOBSON-Julius. The editorial board of ''New Politics'' mourns the March 8th passing of Julius Jacobson, its founding and long time editor.

A memorial meeting will be held Sunday, April 27, 12 noon at the Cantor Film Center auditorium, 36 E. 8 St, NYC. Contributions in his memory can be made to New Politics, POB 98, Brooklyn, New York 11231.
