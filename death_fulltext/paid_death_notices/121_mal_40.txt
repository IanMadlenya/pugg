        BLOOM-Eli. The directors and members of the Greater New York Automobile Dealers Association mourn the loss of director and past-president Eli Bloom. We will all miss his companionship, as well as his leadership as chairman of the long range planning committee. Eli was an extraordinary and giving member of the community who dedicated many years to the service of the Association, and to the greater community. We will miss his warmth, his intellect, and his humanity. We extend our most sincere condolences to his family, friends, and associates. Douglas Callahan, President Mark Schienberg, Executive V.P.
