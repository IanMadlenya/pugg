        PEAK-Robert. 48. Died suddenly on May 13, 2003, of acute arrhythmia. Loving father of Charlotte, who was the center of his life. Devoted husband of Marianna Koval. Beloved son of George and Adele Peak, cherished brother of Audrey Barrow, Catherine Bendert, William Peak and Carol McIntyre. An active member of St. Boniface Catholic Church in Brooklyn, Robert was a respected and admired litigator with the law firm Reboul, MacMurray, Hewitt, and Maynard, which recently joined with Ropes and Gray. A man who gave generously and constantly of himself to his family, his friends, his community, and his church, Bob will be hugely missed. His loss will be marked with a wake today (Friday) 4pm-8pm at St. Boniface Church, 190 Duffield Street between Willoughby and Myrtle Streets in Downtown Brooklyn. A funeral service will be held at St. Boniface Church Saturday, May 17, at noon. In lieu of flowers, contributions in Bob's memory may be made to the Robert Peak Turkana, Kenya Fund in care of the St. Boniface Church Office, 111 Willoughby Street, Brooklyn, NY 11201. Bob's life was marked immeasurably by his monthlong working visit to Turkana last August 2002. The fund will support the St. Boniface community's continued relationship with Turkana.
