        BLATT-Pearl. AMIT is deeply saddened by the passing of the beloved mother of our most dedicated immediate Past President, Evelyn Blachor. Pearl Blatt was a special ''Woman of Valor'' whose charm, warmth, generosity and compassion helped thousands of AMIT children-in-need to grow and prosper as productive members of Israeli society. The AMIT Blatt Youth Village and Mishpachton in Petach Tikvah is a shining example of Pearl Blatt's philantropy and love for the children of Israel; a legacy continued by her children, Evelyn and Isaac Blachor. May the family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Sondra Sokal, President Marvin Leff, Executive Director
