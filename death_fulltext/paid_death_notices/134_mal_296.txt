        KATZ-Ira, Ph.D. Friends and colleagues mourn the passing of Dr. Ira Katz, age 64, on March 24 in West Long Branch, NJ. Our friend was retired as Vice President and Director of Research and Development for International Flavors & Fragrances, where he was employed for 30 years. He was the beloved husband of Loretta and a devoted father to Andrew, Eric and Barbara. He was the loving brother of Barry Katz and Elaine Snyder and was blessed with two grandsons, Alexander and Jason. Services are March 27 at 10 am at the Bloomfield-Cooper Jewish Funeral Chapel in Ocean Township, NJ. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made to the Congregation B'nai Sholom, 213 Lenox Ave, Long Branch, NJ 07740 or the Muscular Dystrophy Association, 1049 Broadway, West Long Branch, NJ 07764. This extraordinary man will be dearly missed by all who knew him.
