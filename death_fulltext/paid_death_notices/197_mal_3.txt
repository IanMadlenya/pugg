        FINCKE--Benjamin G. C. Director Emeritus of Buxton School died at home in Williamstown, MA, February 18th in the company of his family. Born in NYC, October 24, 1914, son of William M. and Helen Hamlin Fincke, he attended Avon Old Farms School in Avon, CT, and graduated in 1937 from Harvard. Before working at Buxton, he had been co-director of his family's boarding school, the former Manumit School in Pennsylvania in the 1940's. He taught at Buxton until he became ill a year ago. During the period of his illness, and long hospitalization, and after his return, Ben was marvelously alert, positive, irreverent and witty. In short, he was Ben-right up to the end. He leaves his wife, the former Magdalene Joslyn; a son, Dr. Graeme Fincke of Cambridge, MA; two daughters, Magdalene Sears of NYC, and Catherine Fincke of Brooklyn, NY; a step-daughter Mary Lathrop of NYC, and four grandchildren. He also leaves several nieces and nephews. Contributions in memory of Mr. Fincke may be made to the Buxton School for the Benjamin G. C. Fincke Scholarship Fund, 291 South St, Williamstown, MA 01267. A memorial service will be held at 2 PM, on Sunday, June 15th at the First Congregational Church in Williamstown. A reception at Buxton School will follow. >>AD#
