        WITKIND-Charlotte Lazarus, 83, ''Char'' to all who knew her, of Columbus, Ohio, May 18, 2003, at home after a long illness. Born August 20, 1919 in Columbus. Nobody lived or loved life more than Char. She was the ultimate fan, of people and sports. Her passions were many and deep. Her partnerships with her forever-loving husband Dick and her beloved New York Yankees were deepest. Char's wondrous abilities with words, songs, and most of all, people, will leave us with memories that can never be erased. From New York to California to her home base in Columbus, her immediate and extended families grieve her passing, but will always cherish her incredible spirit, intellect, openness and joyful look at the world. Active alumna of Columbus School for Girls (1937) and Wellesley College (1941). Limited partner in the ownership of the Yankees, she and Dick traveled from Columbus to Yankee Stadium as often as possible. Her cheers could be heard for miles. Well-known and respected community activist. Vice President of the New York City League of Women Voters. Worked with innumerable organizations in Columbus, furthering community relations, baseball, public radio, and other causes. Preceded in death by parents Hattie and Robert Lazarus, Sr., sister Jean Lazarus Hoffman, and first husband Dr. Warren F. Gorman. Survived by devoted husband of nearly 45 years, Richard Jules Witkind; sister Babette (Howard) Lazarus Sirak; brother Robert (Mary) Lazarus, Jr.; sons Robert (Linda) Lazarus Gorman and Donald (Lisal) Gorman; daughters Babette T. Gorman and Vivian (Jack) Witkind Davis; eight grandchildren; one great grandchild (all of Columbus); numerous nephews and nieces; cousins by the dozens; and friends by the score. Char's life will be celebrated at the residence from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM, Friday, May 23.
