        ROSENSTEIN -- Neil. My friend, Neil, no my buddy, Neil, for over 50 years saw cancer sneak up on him like a cat burglar. It foreshortened his life so abundant in family relationships and business successes. Neil started off as my accountant and for my entire business life, always pitched in on the big judgement calls in my career. He built a mini conglomerate and later a gaming enterprise in Nevada. An aficionado of financial markets, the contemporary art world, travel and politics--you rated many more years, Kimosabe. I will be telling stories of our adventures in the years to come. You faced your aggressor head on when others would have curled up in a ball. I will always remember your last days, when your body had quit but your mind wouldn't stop its inexorable probing. Would the Democrats run Hillary? Where was the stock market headed? What was the last painting I bought, why and how much? With all my love, Martin T. Sosnoff
