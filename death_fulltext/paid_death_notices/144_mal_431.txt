        SHAW-Robert. The Board of Trustees and Staff of Carnegie Hall are deeply saddened by the loss of conductor and musical statesman, Robert Shaw. In the course of a sixty-year relationship with Carnegie Hall that began in 1939, Mr. Shaw performed at the Hall more than fifty times, including his renowned Robert Shaw Choral Workshops, which have taken place every year since 1990. His legendary attention to detail in the art of choral conducting, his musicianship, his conviction, and his humanity were an inspiration to all who knew and worked with him, and his presence will be sorely missed. We extend our sincerest sympathies to his family. Isaac Stern, President Sanford I. Weill, Chairman

The Chorale dedicates its February 20th performance at The Church of The Heavenly Rest, of Durufle's Requiem, one of Mr. Shaw's favorite chorale works, to his memory. Robert Bass, Music Director Susan Shine, Chair
        SHAW-Robert. A most respected and loved colleague who changed the level of choral conducting forever in the United States. In addition to the exalted music he made, we will miss his unique, profound humanity. Isaac Stern
