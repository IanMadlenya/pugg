        SCHWARTZ--James H., M.D., Ph.D. The psychoanalytic community, no less than the neuroscientific one, owes a huge debt of gratitude to Dr. James H. Schwartz. In 1990, together with Dr. Arnold Pfeffer, he took the revolutionary step of forming an interdisciplinary seminar in which psychoanalysts discussed with neuroscientists (their historical archrivals) what they had learned about the workings of the mind. This would not have been possible had it not been for Dr. Schwartz's impeccable scientific credentials and the wide network of authorities that he could count as personal friends. In due course, he made them friends of psychoanalysis too. His efforts culminated in the establishment of the vibrant International Neuro-Psychoanalysis Society and its journal Neuro-Psychoanalysis, on whose editorial board he sat since its inception in 1999. The interdisciplinary seminar that he started still continues in the form of a monthly public lecture at the Arnold Pfeffer Center at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute. Our warmest sympathy to his family. Mark Solms, Ph.D., Director Arnold Pfeffer Center NY Psychoanalytic Institute
