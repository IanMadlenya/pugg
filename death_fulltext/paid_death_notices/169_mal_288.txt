        KUPFERBERG - Herbert. The staff of Parade Magazine mourns the loss of a beloved friend and colleague. In his 33 years of service, Herb Kupferberg helped shape Parade into the successful magazine it is today. His contributions were significant and farreaching; his talent immense. Many benefited from his wise counsel and guidance. We will miss his sense of humor, keen intellect and deep sense of commitment. We extend our deepest sympathies to his loving wife, Barbara, his children and grandchildren. Walter Anderson, Publisher
