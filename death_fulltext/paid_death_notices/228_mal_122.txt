        SCHNEIDER--Irving M. Dr. New York Hospital Queens Board of Trustees, administration, medical staff, and employees mourn the passing of Irving M. Schneider, M.D., attending urologist. Dr. Schneider was a founding father of our institution, which he helped establish in 1956 as Booth Memorial Medical Center. He and his dedicated team went on to lay the foundation for the institution as a top quality community teaching hospital that now serves thousands of Queens residents everyday. As an expression of his dedication to his patients, he would often sleep by there bedside during recovery. He will be remembered as a role model and mentor to physicians who succeed him. His beloved wife, Henrietta, is in our thoughts. Sincerely George F. Heinrich, M.D., Chairman, Board of Trustees Stephen S. Mills, President and Chief Executive Officer John E. Sciortino, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer David H. Snyder, M.D., President, Medical Staff Soc William G. Wolff, M.D., President, Medical Board James W. Turner, M.D., Chairman, Dept of surgery Albert Tarasuk, M.D., Directer, Division of Urology
