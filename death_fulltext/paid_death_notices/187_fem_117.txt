        OSKOWITZ-Alycia. It's not supposed to happen to a young, 32 year old, beautiful, energetic, warm, funny and intelligent woman. Alycia died suddenly on Thursday evening following a major asthmatic attack one day before her engagement party that she had so meticulously and tastefully planned for months. The staff and owners of Kleinfeld Bridal are in shock. We will miss this very special young lady. Her work skills and business ethic as Director of Marketing and Public Relations benefit thousands of brides who purchase their wedding gowns from us each year, as well as her friends at the TV networks, at the bridal and fashion magazines & at the knot.com. To her beloved mother Leslie, her stepfather Tom, her adorable sisters Brooke, Gia and Fallon, her family and to her loving fiance Alex, our deepest sympathy. We will miss her terribly. Kleinfeld Bridal Mara J. Urshel, President Ronald R. Rothstein, CEO
