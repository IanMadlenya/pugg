        CULLMAN - Marguerite. We mourn the passing of Marguerite Cullman, an esteemed member of the Lighthouse Board of Directors for nearly 50 years. In addition to the Board, Mrs. Cullman served on the Lighthouse Women's Committee, joining it in 1943. In her many decades of service, she brought invaluable assistance to the Lighthouse and to those who are blind and partially sighted. We will miss her caring and dedication, and we extend heartfelt condolences to her family and friends. Timothy W. Knipe Chairman, Board of Directors Barbara Silverstone President and CEO
        CULLMAN-Marguerite W. The Directors and staff of Spence-Chapin Services to Families and Children acknowledge with sadness the passing of Mrs Cullman, a board member from 1953 to 1977 who in service to the agency was tireless in her commitment to find loving homes for infants in need of adoptive families, and in retirement remained a dedicated and generous benefactress. We admire her many contributions to our work and extend heartfelt sympathy to her family and freinds. Katharine S. Legg, Exec. Dir.
