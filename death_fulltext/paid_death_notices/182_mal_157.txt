        SILBERSTEIN-Dr. Joe. We shall miss our remarkable friend and treasure wonderful memories. David ''Bill'' and Barbara Kahn
        SILBERSTEIN-Joseph, M.D. Cherished husband of Thelma for more than 50 years. Model father of Debbie, Linda and Eric. Trusting father-in-law of Fred, Larry and Nancy. Inspirational grandfather of Jonathan, Zachery and Jacob. Friend to all. Doctor to many. Died suddenly on March 8, 2002. An octogenarian, he served as a captain in the U.S. Army in W.W. II, a doctor in the communities of Port Chester and Rye Brook for over 35 years and a respected counselor to family, friends and the ''Hammerschlag'' clan for even longer. Dr. Joe was born and raised in the Bronx, graduated from City College, received a Master's in Public Health from Columbia University and a medical degree from the University of Zurich. He ministered to all in need, chaired the Department of Family Practice at United Hospital of Port Chester, served his community as police doctor, school physician and family practitioner par excellence, painted beautifully, golfed with a need to swing and, above all, loved, nurtured and aided endlessly. Funeral services will be held at Congregation Kneses Tifereth Israel, 575 King St., Port Chester, NY at 1 PM Sunday, March 10, 2002. Contributions may be made in his memory to United Hospital of Port Chester, 406 Boston Post Road, Port Chester, New York 10573.
