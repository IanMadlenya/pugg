        NEUSTADTER-Helene, (nee Lerner). The Trustees of Congregation Shearith Israel extend to our fellow Trustee, and Co-Segan, Peter Neustadter, his wife Naomi and their daughters our shared loss on the death of his mother in Israel. Peter's leadership and devotion to our congregation were a source of pride to his mother as they are to us.
