        DAVIS-Lawrence. On December 2, 2000. We mourn the loss of an extraordinary man whose warmth and caring nature made him the greatest friend and ''Uncle'' one could ever have. His romantic way and passion for enjoying life to its fullest will continue to inspire us all. He was more like family than friend. Our family is honored to have shared a lifetime of wonderful memories and a rewarding friendship with Larry and his family. We extend our love and support to Bette, Scott, Vicki and their families. We will miss Larry deeply. Aaron, Francine, David, Susan, Lewis and Caryl Levine
