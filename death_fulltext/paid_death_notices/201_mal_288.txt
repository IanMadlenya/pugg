        GRAUBARD--Seymour. The Anti - Defamation League mourns the passing of Seymour Graubard, ADL Honorary National Chairman. Seymour, who became involved with the League in 1936, served as ADL National Chairman from 1970 through 1976. He dedicated his life to the welfare of the Jewish people and the State of Israel. Sy worked tirelessly as an advocate for Soviet Jewry and travelled to Russia with then NYC Mayor John Lindsay, to provide support for Jewish refuseniks. He lead the fight against Arab propaganda and the Arab boycott against Israel. He was a mentor to ADL's National Directors. For more than 65 years he provided ADL with his wise counsel. He will be sorely missed. We extend our sincere condolences to his daughter Katherine and the entire family. Glen A. Tobias National Chairman Abraham H. Foxman National Director
