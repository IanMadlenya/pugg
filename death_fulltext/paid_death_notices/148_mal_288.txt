It is with a profound sense of loss that the Board of Trustees, Medical Board and Administration of Beth Israel Medical Center join with the leadership of its parent company, Continuum Health Partners, Inc., in acknowledging the passing of our dear friend and devoted colleague, Raphael Recanati, Honorary Trustee of Beth Israel. Few have matched the extraordinary philanthropy of Mr. Recanati and his devoted wife, Dina, to Beth Israel.

Mr. Recanati's creative philanthropic approach served as a crucial resource to our staff, allowing them to make important advances in patient care and expanded medical knowledge. He will forever be remembered for helping to create a clinical and educational environment that makes Beth Israel a vibrant place to study and practice medicine. Our heartfelt condolences are extended to Dina, his sons Oudi and Michael, the entire Recanati family and all whose lives have been touched by his extraordinary humanitarian spirit. Morton P.
