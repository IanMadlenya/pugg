        DUFFY--Betty Minor. The Board of Directors and Members of the International Fine Print Dealers Association sadly note the passing of our colleague on February 13, 2006. A member since 1987 and founder of the Bethesda Art Gallery, she will be remembered as a highly respected dealer who helped collectors rediscover early 20th Century American prints. We extend our condolences to her husband, Douglas Duffy, her two daughters, Wrenetta Ward Duffy, Elizabeth Woodford Lagrone, and their families.
