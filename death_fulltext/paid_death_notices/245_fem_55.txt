        $(6$)STIEVELMAN--Harriet, was the love of her husband's life Jack for 52 years, a devoted and loving mother to Jodi, Troy and Gabi, mother-in-law to Stacy and Mitchell, loyal and generous sister to Barbara and proud and fun loving grandmother to Chelsey, Casey, Kori, Jared, Jake and Jonathan, passed away on June 7, 2007 in Manhattan. She was 71 years young. To know her was to love her. She would best be described as a delicious person. She touched and enriched so many people's lives with her ever positive attitude, her willingness to listen and her enormous capacity for compassion. She was a beautiful woman inside and out. She wore her elegance and class in a quiet way.Harriet loved to dance, hike, bike, play tennis, ski and adored animals. She was involved in many charities. She was an art collector and at one time owned a gallery in Manhattan. She traveled the world and had a spectacular life. Her smile lit up a room. We will keep that smile in our hearts forever. We miss her already. Services are at Temple Bethel in Great Neck, New York, Sunday June 10th at 10:00 A.M.
        $(6$)STIEVELMAN--Harriet. In loving memory of Harriet Stievelman, a wonderful friend, wife, mother and grandmother. We will miss and love you always. Howard and Karen Susan and David
