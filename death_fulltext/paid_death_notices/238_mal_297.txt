        KING--Daniel G, LTC. The Officers and Members of the Veteran Corps of Artillery mourn the passing of our Plans & Operations Officer. He was a loyal and dedicated soldier, a member of the senior staff who will be greatly missed; ''a hard act to follow''. Our sympathy goes to his sister Maureen and her family.
