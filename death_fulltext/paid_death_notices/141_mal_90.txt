        UNTERBERG-Aaron. All of us at the East Midwood Jewish Center profoundly mourn the passing of this paragon of religiosity. He was a learned Jew who loved to pray and fulfill the commandments of our faith. He was also the consummate gentleman and a friend to all. He will be sorely missed. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his family. Dr. Alvin Kass, Rabbi Marsha Shlefstein, President
