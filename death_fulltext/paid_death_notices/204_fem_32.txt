        LASLEY--R. Allison. 55, died peacefully after a prolonged illness on January 1, 2004. She was the devoted wife of Stuart Goode of New York City and the sister of John Lasley of San Francisco. Allison was an accomplished artist with a committed following across the US and Europe. Born in Chicago, Allison grew up in San Francisco, before moving to Manhattan and Bridgehampton, where she and her Stuart became an inseparable team. She leaves behind so many close friends who relished her charm, humor and warmth. Oh, how we shall all miss her unique spirit. The light, joy and color that Allison found in the world she reflected back to us in her paintings and personality. Allison Lasley's memorial service will be held in the spring when her peonies bloom. In lieu of flowers, the family would appreciate donations in her memory to the American Academy in Rome or the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.
