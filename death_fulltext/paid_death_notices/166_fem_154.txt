        BERNSTEIN-Martha. The American Friends of Bar-Ilan University mourn the passing of Martha Bernstein of Miami Beach after a prolonged illness. She was a generous patron of Bar-Ilan and, in addition to other gifts, dedicated a classroom in one of our buildings in Israel. We extend our sympathy to all members of her family. Rabbi Emanuel Rackman, Chancellor, Bar-Ilan University
