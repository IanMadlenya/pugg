        McFADDEN-Barbara A. The Faculty, Alumni Association, Advisory Council, students and staff of the Columbia University School of Social Work record with sadness the sudden death of Barbara A. McFadden, a 1984 graduate and past president of the Alumni Association. A leader in community, church and professional activities, she made valuable contributions in human services areas, especially minority affairs. A dedicated and respected alumna, program coordinator for Columbia's Real Estate Office and former adjunct lecturer at the School, she will be greatly missed by her many friends and colleagues. Sincerest sympathies are extended to the members of her family. Ronald A. Feldman, Dean Susan A. Nayowith, President, Alumni Association
