        HISCANO--Margaret (Peggy) von Lengerke 82, of Short Hills, NJ died at her home on Thursday, November 16, 2006. Born in Orange, New Jersey, Mrs. Hiscano was a graduate of the Beard School (now Morristown Beard) and Bennett Junior College. During World War II she volunteered as a Red Cross nurse's aide. Following the war, she was a teacher and a board member at the Orange Day Nursery in Orange. She later founded the Hillside Nursery School, also in Orange. During the 1970's, she ran the nature discovery program for children at the Cora Hartshorn Arboretum in Short Hills. An avid traveler and nature lover, Mrs. Hiscano maintained homes in Andover, New Jersey and Harbour Island, Bahamas. She was a member of the Garden Club of Short Hills and served as president of the Garden Club of the Oranges. Although she won numerous awards for her floral designs, she found greater joy in picking wildflowers and sharing her life-long love of horticulture with others. She was a former member of the Junior League of the Oranges and Short Hills, the Orange Lawn Tennis Club, Baltusrol Golf Club, and the Short Hills Club. Predeceased by her husband, Ralph, Mrs. Hiscano leaves behind her children, Margaret (Peggy) McDermott, Peter P. Hiscano, Douglas R. Hiscano, and Dwight L. Hiscano, and nine grandchildren. She'll be remembered by her extended family and large circle of friends for her mischievous sense of humor. A memorial service will be held on Saturday, November 25, at 11:00am at Christ Church in Short Hills. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Garden Club of the Oranges or St. Hubert's Giralda in Madison, NJ.
