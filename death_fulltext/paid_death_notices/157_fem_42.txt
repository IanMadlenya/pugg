        KRAUS-Janet. We mourn the loss of our dear and dedicated colleague. Janet was a wonderful person who never had an unkind word to say about anyone. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to her husband, Tony, to her children Tom and Joanne, to her son-in-law Peter, to her four loving grandchildren, and to her brother, Leonard. We will miss our good friend. May God be with her always! Tishman Speyer Properties
