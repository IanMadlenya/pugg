        VANCE-Cyrus R. The Yale Class of 1939 mourns the passing of our esteemed classmate, Cyrus R. Vance, whose life of public service has been well documented in these pages and elsewhere. We extend our sympathies to his wife, Grace, and family and to those who studied and worked with him through the years. For us, he epitomized the last words of our alma mater, ''For God, for Country, and for Yale.'' Lycurgus M. Davey, Secretary Dorsey Whitestone, Treasurer Alan K. Gage, Class Agent Leete P. Doty & Bertram J. Trent Corresponding Secretaries for the Yale Alumni Magazine
