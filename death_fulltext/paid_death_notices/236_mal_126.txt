        BRICKMAN - Roslyn. The Yeshiva University family is saddened by the passing of a kind, gentle and loving Jewish Woman of Valor, who was the beloved wife of Leon Brickman; cherished mother of Rena (and Mordy) Rosen, Zahava (and Moshael) Straus, and Noah (and Barbara) Brickman; adored sister of Rabbi Nathan (and Shulamith) Goldberg; and doting grandmother of eight and great-grandmother of two. Zahava and Moshael J. Straus (YU and RIETS Trustee) are YU Benefactors who named The Joseph and Gwendolyn Straus Chair in Talmud at the Mazer School of Talmudic Studies, The Joseph and Gwendolyn Straus Chair in Jewish Education at the Azrieli Graduate School of Jewish Education and Administration of which Board he is Chair, and have also supported scholarships at YU's Cardozo School of Law and our undergraduate schools. May the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel, President Norman Lamm, Chancellor Morry J. Weiss, Chairman YU Board of Trustees Julius Berman, Chairman RIETS Board of Trustees
