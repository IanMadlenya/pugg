        DALRYMPLE-Jean, was the ''Mother'' of City Center and we will miss her. It's been a great comfort to think of her on opening nights -across the street from the theater-looking down from her apartment at the arriving crowds, and of the audiences who have thrilled to the art on our stage since City Center's founding in 1943. This theater is a living, breathing memorial to Jean's memory. The Board of Directors and staff of City Center
