        NIGRO-Giovanna. The Board of Directors and Staff of United Cerebral Palsy of New York City mourn the passing of Giovanna Nigro, a program director at UCP for 28 years. Miss Nigro's level of achievement in her work and commitment to the disabled was unparalleled. We extend our deepest sympathy to her family.
