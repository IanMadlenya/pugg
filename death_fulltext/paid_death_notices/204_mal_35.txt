        FALENCKI--John J., M.D. The entire Beth Israel Medical Center family notes with sadness the untimely passing of our dear friend and longtime colleague, John J. Falencki, M.D. As the first Family Medicine physician to have admitting privileges at the hospital, he helped pave the way for the establishment of the Alfred and Gail Engelberg Department of Family Medicine at Beth Israel in 1993. He also was active in the hospital's Ethics Committee, and was a respected and engaging teacher. He embodied what we all value in a physician who practices equally with his heart and his hands. To his wife Maureen, his children Emily, Jonah, and Andrew, his mother Karen, the entire Falencki family, and all who loved him, we extend heartfelt condolences. Thomas Killip, M.D., Interim President and CEO Donald M. Kastenbaum, M.D., President Medical Board Robert M. Schiller, M.D., Chairman, Department of Family Medicine Robert L. Salant, M.D. President, Doctors Alumni Association
