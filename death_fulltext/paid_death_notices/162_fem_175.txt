        TRAUBE-Mildred. Everyone at the Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization mourns the passing of Mildred Traube. Those of us who got to know Mildred will miss her straightforward opinions and clear-eyed wisdom, the result of a long and extraordinary life. Her daughter Vicky is one of our stalwart cohorts and we will be ever grateful to Mildred and Shepard for having brought Vicky into the world-and for having taken her to so much theater that she is practically a walking encyclopedia. Our condolences to Vicky and to Betsy.
