        COOPER-Faye. The community of West End Synagogue mourns the loss of this ardent Reconstructionist. A librarian for many years, she was warm, alert and, to the last, interested enough in the world to travel the globe. We will miss her but take her example. To her adoring son Jonathan and her beloved granddaughter Emily Maxwell Cooper go all our sympathies. West End Synagogue, A Reconstructionist Congregation Rabbi Avi Winokur, Rabbi Yael Ridberg, President Marcia Weller
