        WALTHER - Paulette Rosselet. The trustees, advisors, and staff of the Trust for Mutual Understanding are deeply saddened by the death of our friend and colleague, Paulette Rosselet Walther. After joining the Rockefeller Brothers Fund in 1972, she moved to the Rockefeller philanthropic office where she helped to coordinate the charitable giving of a number of family members. For the past 12 years, she served as program associate at the Trust for Mutual Understanding, bringing to her work a professional commitment and a striving for excellence matched only by her personal warmth and her wonderful sensitivity. Her dedication, enthusiasm and genuine caring for others earned her the admiration and respect of everyone involved in the trust's efforts to encourage greater understanding between the United States and the countries of East and Central Europe. We extend our sympathy and condolences to her children Bruno, Ronda and Karen and to the other members of her family. Richard S. Lanier, Elizabeth J. McCormack, Donal C. O'Brien, Jr., Trustees, Trust for Mutual Understanding
