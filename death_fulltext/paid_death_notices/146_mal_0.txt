        BERG-Wayne, FAIA. An enormous talent, a colleague of exquisite professionalism and a dear friend. He joined us in 1987 as design principal and has been an inestimable force in our lives and work. His achievement as an architect is reflected in his many important design awards, the extent of his published work, his election to 40 Under 40 and Emerging Voices, and his wide ranging service to the profession. His absence will leave a hole in our hearts and our world that will be impossible to fill. We extend our sympathy to his wife Ann, his son Alex, and his family.
