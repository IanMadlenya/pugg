        PLACZEK-Adolf. Colleagues at Avery Library and Columbia University mourn the passing of Dolf Placzek, Avery Librarian, teacher and scholar. Dolf's passion and dedication to Avery Library are a lasting contribution to architectural scholarship. We extend our deepest sympathies to his widow, Beverley, his family and his many friends. He was a role model for many, beloved by all and he will long be in our memory. Contributions can be made to the Adolf Placzek Memorial Fund for Classic Architectural Books in Avery Library.
