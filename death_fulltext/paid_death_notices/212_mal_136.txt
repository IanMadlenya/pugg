        O'BRIEN--Joel. 61, in Los Angeles on September 9. Beloved musician and artist. He was an impeccable rock drummer who recorded with James Taylor, Carole King and many others; a visual artist of fertile and whimsical imagination; a jazz instrumentalist, vocalist, and composer steeped in the tradition that he loved passionately. He was a conserver of lost treasures and an inventor of new combinations. His family and friends mourn his loss and treasure the memory of his humor, generosity, and rare freedom of spirit.
