        RIVLIN--Moshe. Former National Chairman of Jewish National Fund. A dreamer and a doer for Peace and Mutual Understanding in Israel and the World. We were privileged to share some of his dreams, which led to the creation and construction of Reservoir Neve Ur to help in the mutual development of Israel and Jordan. We will miss his wisdom and counseling. Jerome and Maxine Belson
