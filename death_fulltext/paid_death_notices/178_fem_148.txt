        SLANER-Luella B. The Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science of Columbia University mourn the passing of Luella B. Slaner, a special friend and benefactor. Among her many acts of philanthropy, her gifts to Columbia University supported young faculty and research that advanced new techiques to confine high-temperature, ionized matter for fusion energy. Motivated by the 1973 oil embargo, she believed the health of the planet could be improved by developing alternate energy sources. In 1981, she led efforts to raise funds and produce a documentary describing the potential for fusion energy that was televised nationally. Mrs. Slaner will be deeply missed and fondly remembered as a dynamic and constructive person who was devoted to higher education and the realization of practical, clean sources of energy.
