        SILVER--Joseph W., M.D. The board of trustees, medical staff, administration and employees of New York Methodist Hospital deeply mourn the passing of our respected friend and colleague, Joseph W. Silver, M.D. Dr. Silver was affiliated with New York Methodist Hospital for 40 years and had served as chief of orthopedic surgery at the Hospital for the past 20 years. His dedication and service to New York Methodist were honored when he received the 2004 Physician Service Award at the Hospital's annual dinner dance last May. Known as an outstanding technical and clinical surgeon, Dr. Silver was much loved and greatly esteemed by his patients as well as his colleagues. He was also an excellent teacher. He was associate clinical professor of orthopedic surgery at the SUNY/Downstate College of Medicine and professor of surgery at Saint George's University School of Medicine. He authored or co-authored articles in numerous peer-reviewed journals and was active in many professional societies. At various times, he served as president, vice president, secretary and treasurer of the Brooklyn Orthopaedic Society. We will greatly miss this outstanding and compassionate gentleman and we send our deepest sympathies to Dr. Silver's family, especially his wife, Madeline, his children, Lauren and Marc, and his three grandchildren.
        SILVER--Joseph W., MD. We mourn the loss of our dearest friend Joe whose indomitable spirit and cheerful smile will never be forgotten. Our heartfelt condolences to his family. Polinsky & Schiowitz families
