        ROSEN--Natalie. We are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of the mother of our beloved and esteemed colleague and friend, David Rosen. To David and his brother Mark, and to the entire Rosen family, we extend our sincere condolences. The party for Mrs. Rosen's 95th birthday is only the most recent of so many wonderful celebrations your family was fortunate enough to share with your elegant and cultured mother, grandmother and great-grandmother. You are indeed blessed to have such cherished memories. Herrick, Feinstein LLP
