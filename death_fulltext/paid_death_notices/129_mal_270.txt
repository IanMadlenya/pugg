        BOGATY-Harry. Long a resident of Englewood, New Jersey, on October 18, 1997, at his home in Westborough, MA. Dear husband of Helene Marer Bogaty for fifty years, cherished father of Lewis and his wife Lissa, and Daniel and his wife Fran, beloved brother of Beck Bogaty, dear grandfather of David, Tanya, Louie, and Michael, he will be sorely missed. He was a man of high principle and great optimism, who was always concerned for others. His presence enriched the world.
