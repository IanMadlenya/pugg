        LINDERMAN--Brenda, 64, of Boynton Beach passed away July 22, 2003. Sometimes in life if you are very lucky you will find someone like Brenda. She was more than a wife, she was a confidant, my partner, my friend. She made life a joy and an adventure. She touched everyone with whom she came in contact. She was a proud, adoring and loving mother to Jeffrey and Jennifer and she considered our son-in-law David as a second son. But the love of her life, the apple of her eye and her greatest thrill was to be Dillon's Bubby. Now she's free of the pain that has consumed her these past seven months. It's up to us to now feel the loneliness without her. If after all we judge a person's life by those they touch, the good they do, the joy and love they give to others, than her short stay on this earth was a gift to everyone, especially to me. Sleep in peace, my darling. I love you and you will always be in my heart and in every fiber of my being until I'm with you again. As always, ILY, Gary. >>AD#
