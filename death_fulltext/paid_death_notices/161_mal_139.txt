        LAWRENCE-Jacob. The Boards of Trustees and Governors and the staff of the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture mourn the passing of a dear friend. Jacob Lawrence served on the School's Board of Governors for 32 years and taught eight times, beginning in 1954 and most recently in 1996. Skowhegan honored him in 1995 with the Skowhegan Medal of Painting. Jacob Lawrence was part of the Skowhegan family for close to fifty years and we are proud to have known him. We send our condolences to his wife Gwendolyn Knight Lawrence.
        LAWRENCE-Jacob. The members of the American Academy of Arts and Letters note with sorrow the death of their esteemed colleague whose passing will be deeply mourned by the world of art.
