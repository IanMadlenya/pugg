        COHEN-Barbara. The officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Barbara Cohen, who earned enormous admiration and respect for her exceptional generosity and leadership on behalf of Jewish and other humanitarian causes. Jointly committed to philanthropy, Barbara, and her beloved husband, Joseph, have been exemplary leaders of UJA-Federation. Barbara will be remembered for generations to come for her kindness, wisdom, and caring. We extend our deepest sympathies to Joseph; to Barbara's son, Jarrod, & daughterin-law, Audrey; to her son, Jon; to her grandson, Jordan; and to the entire Cohen family.
