        LANDAU--Alfred. Of Rockville Centre, New York and Prince Edwards Island. August 29 at 85 years. I will sorely miss my dear friend and mentor Alfred, who was the most interesting, well read world traveler, passionate art lover, theater/opera/movie goer. Never missed a great restaurant, nor failed to make a new acquaintance and learn their ''secrets'' in minutes. A true ''out-of-the-box'' personality who cannot be equalled. Funeral Wednesday 9:30 AM, Plaza Memorial Chapel, 630 Amsterdam Ave at 90 St. Shiva at his cousin's home, Gertrude Landau, 235 East 22 Street, NYC, Apt 3H Thursday 6-8PM. James H. Caspi
