        LEVI-Edward H. It is with deep sorrow that the American Academy of Arts and Sciences mourns the loss of Edward Levi, Attorney General of the United States and President of the Academy from 1985 to 1989. Throughout his presidency, he worked to renew the Academy's historic mission to bring together distinguished individuals from all fields and professions in service to society. During his term, the Academy completed a major study of fundamentalist movements throughout the world. He brought to the Academy the intellectual integrity, insight and wisdom that characterized his many contributions to both the academic and public life of this nation. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Kate, to his family, and to all those touched by his kindness, grace and generosity of spirit. Daniel C. Tosteson President Leo L. Beranek Harvey Brooks Herman Feshbach Jaroslav Pelikan Victor Weisskopf Past Presidents Leslie C. Berlowitz Executive Officer
