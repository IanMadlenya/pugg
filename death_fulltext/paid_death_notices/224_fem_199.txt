        GODLEY--Elizabeth McCray. The Friends of Bassett and the medical staff and administration of Bassett Healthcare mourn the passing of our friend, colleague and member of the Friends' board of directors. Her support for the Friends of Bassett and the patients and families served by Bassett Healthcare was unwavering. Mrs. Godley and her late husband, Ambassador George McMurtrie (''Mac'') Godley, supported many of Bassett's regional initiatives that continue to benefit thousands of patients and families throughout central New York. Following the Ambassador's death, Mrs. Godley's generosity helped establish Bassett's Critical Care Complex, the Bassett Heart Care Institute and the Mithoefer Center for Rural Surgery. Mrs. Godley was the quintessential woman of action. We are most honored that she gave so much of her time, experience and support to advance rural health care in our region. We send our deepest condolences to her family. She will be deeply missed. William F. Streck, M.D. President and C.E.O., Bassett Healthcare Charles T.
