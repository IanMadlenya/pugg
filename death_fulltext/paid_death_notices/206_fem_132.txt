        SELEVAN -- Bashie. Boys Town Jerusalem mourns with profound sorrow the passing of a most cherished member of its extended family. Together with her beloved Irwin, z''l, her partner in life and tzedakah, Bashie was committed heart and soul to the welfare of Am Yisrael and Eretz Yisrael. Bashie identified with the teaching of our Sages that our children are our builders, assisting the students of Boys Town Jerusalem over the decades by generously supporting virtually every one of the school's programs. Bashie followed the shining example of her parents, personifying the lofty ideals of Torah, Avodah and G'milut Chasadim. A Chai Founder and respected member of Boys Town's Board of Directors, Bashie's most recent nachat was her High Holiday trip to Israel when she dedicated the Clair and Emanuel G. Rosenblatt Residence Hall, endowed by her late brother as an expression of his love for her. Bashie's memory will be sanctified in the bonds of eternal life through the lives of the children/builders she nourished. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to the entire family.
