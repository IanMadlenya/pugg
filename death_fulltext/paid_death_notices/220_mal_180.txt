        LEVITAN--James. The partners of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP mourn the passing of our colleague James A. Levitan, founding partner of our firm's Tax Group. Jim was a key player in the development of the firm and imbued the Tax Group with a spirit of utmost professionalism. All Jim did, he did with a welcoming spirit that drew people closer to him. We will miss Jim's intelligence, kindness, collegiality and good cheer; but, his legacy will always be readily apparent among us. Jim is survived by his wife Ruth and their three daughters Deborah, Judith and Susan. A memorial service will take place on Friday, May 20, at 2PM at Leo P. Gallagher Funeral Home, 2900 Summer Street, Stamford, CT.
