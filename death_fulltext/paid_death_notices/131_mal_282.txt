        NARKISS-Uzi. The Jerusalem Foundation Inc. mourns the passing of General Uzi Narkiss who commanded the troops that achieved the liberation of Jerusalem and restored Jewish Sovereignty to the Holy City. A man of deep humanity, he was truly committed to Jewish and Zionist education, and a great friend of all those who seeked to make Jerusalem a city of peace. May his family and friends be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Alvin H. Einbender, Chairman Kenneth J.
