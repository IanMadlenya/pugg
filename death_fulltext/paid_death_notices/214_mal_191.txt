        MEGGITT--Dr. Mervyn John, distinguished Professor Emeritus, of Anthropology at City University of New York, died peacefully on November 13. Mervyn graduated from the University of Sydney, Australia, where he conducted pioneering research on the peoples of the Central Desert of Australia and Papua New Guinea highlands. This led to publications which continue to be highly regarded. As a teacher, Mervyn was ins piring, astute and assiduous. Mervyn had a deep interest in the visual arts. He found enormous pleasure in walking through Central Park to his beloved ''Met'' where he spent many happy hours. Those fortunate enough to visit art galleries with Mervyn, inevitably spoke of how he deepened their art appreciation. Mervyn was an erudite and wise man with a fine sense of humor that connected him to many friends, young and old, all over the world. He is survived by his devoted wife Joan who shared 55 years of his life. Mervyn will remain much loved as a cherished husband and sadly missed as a raconteur, wise counsel and compassionate friend.
