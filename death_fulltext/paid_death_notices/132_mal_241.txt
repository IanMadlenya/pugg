        GREENBERG-Herman. The officers, trustees, and members of Temple Gates of Prayer record with profound sorrow the passing of our past President, Herman Greenberg. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife Connie, to his children Stewart, Karen and Judy, their spouses and children, to his sister Edith, and his mother-in-law Helene Schmuger. He served a distinguished term of office as President of our congregation from 1987 to 1990. When our Temple was destroyed by fire in 1977, he was a vital force in its reconstruction and again directed its refurbishing in 1991. As an officer and trustee, he strove both for continuity and renewal. His devotion to the Temple was limitless. We mourn our great loss. Morris A. Urieff, President Albert Thaler, Rabbi
