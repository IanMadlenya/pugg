        OLSHANSKY-Nancy. The Board and Staff of the Council of Jewish Federations mourn the sudden loss of Nancy Olshansky, adored wife of Bernard, former Senior Associate Executive Vice President of the Council of Jewish Federations. Born in Boston, Nancy married Bernie in 1952. An avid reader, she persued her own interests wherever his career took them. She was a past President of the Boston Chapter of the National Council of Jewish Women, and a past Vice President of Brandeis University National Women's Committee. Nancy loved learning and passed that passion to their children, to whom she was devoted, and to their grandchildren, the lights of her life. Besides her beloved Bernie, she is survived by their children, Judith Ann and Douglas Gragg, of Boston; Susan and Gary Singer, of Chicago; and Kenneth and Margo Olshansky, of Brooklyn; and their grandchildren, Jason, Sam and Melanie Gragg, Jessica and Hannah Singer, Gideon and Clara Olshansky. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion. Donations in her blessed memory may be made to either the Brandeis University National Women's Committee Nancy L. Olshansky Book Fund or to the Combined Jewish Philanthropies of Greater Boston. Conrad L. Giles, M.D., Pres., CJF Martin S. Kraar, Exec V.P., CJF
