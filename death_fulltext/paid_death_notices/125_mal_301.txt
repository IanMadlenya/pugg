        COHEN-Elias A. Although 45 years have passed since our beloved founder, Elias A. Cohen, passed away on July 2, 1952, he is still remembered with love and reverence by the thousands of deserving boys and girls who are privileged to come to his Tranquility Farm & Camp for a few fun-filled weeks each summer since July 1st, 1919. In the spirit of ''Noblesse Oblige,'' his devoted family, his many loyal friends and a grateful alumni are all helping to perpetuate his Tranquility Camp as a living monument to this great American humanitarian. We are proud to announce that our 79th camp season will begin on July 2, 1997. Tranquility Camp Inc. Earlton, New York Pearl C. Miller, President
