        TALBERT-William F. The United States Tennis Association mourns the loss of a true friend and great champion. As tournament director, Bill Talbert guided the US OPEN at Forest Hills and Flushing Meadows. A four-time champion in the US Nationals doubles, Bill also led the United States to Davis Cup victories as a captain and player. We will miss Bill at the US OPEN and extend our sympathies to his sons, Peter and Pike, and the rest of his family.
