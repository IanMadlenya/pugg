        AMES-Amyas. With great sadness, the Board and staff of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Inc. mourn the passing of Amyas Ames, Chairman of the Board of Lincoln Center from 1970 to 1981 and Chairman of the Board of New York Philharmonic from 1970 to 1983. Amyas led Lincoln Center through an accomplished yet challenging decade. He welcomed a number of new Lincoln Center constituent organizations, oversaw the reconstruction of Avery Fisher Hall, and became the driving force behind the Lincoln Center Fund. Under his leadership, several Lincoln Center hallmarks came into being: ''Live from Lincoln Center'', The Lincoln Center Institute for Arts in Education, The Consolidated Corporate Fund, and a greatly expanded series of community programs. In addition to successful fund raising for Lincoln Center, he showed great personal generosity as well. On a national level, he was a tireless advocate for the arts. As Honorary Chairman of Lincoln Center since 1981, he remained a devoted and involved friend. We send our condolences to his wife Lucia Millham Ames, his children Oakes, Edward, Joan and Olivia Hoblitzelle and to his grandchildren and his great grandchildren. Beverly Sills, Chairman Nathan Leventhal, President Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Inc.
