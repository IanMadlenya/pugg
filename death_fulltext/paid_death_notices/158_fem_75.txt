        CAHN-Frieda. The Levkoff family is profoundly saddened by the passing of Frieda Cahn, devoted wife of Henry and beloved mother of our dearest friend, Marilyn and her sister, Barbara. Although she lived for many years in Cincinnati, we know her heart was always with her daughters and granddaughters. We send our love and most sincere condolences to the family. Susan and Steven Levkoff
