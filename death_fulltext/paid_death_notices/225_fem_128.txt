        HERTZ--Renee L. Of Riverside Drive and Accord, NY, passed away on October 18, 2005. She is survived by her children and her in-law children, Genie, Eric and Troy, Michele and Larry, Franny and Ira; her grandchildren, Cade, Doug, Emilia, Isabel, Robert, Ronald and Teal; her brother, Arthur Lehrman; and her airedale, Earnest. As a pioneer for quality integrated education in the 1970s, she inspired us with her moral compass. She taught us to speak up and fight for what is right. She challenged us with her vast reading of literature and her daily reading of The New York Times. She enhanced our aesthetic sensibilities with her profound appreciation for beauty in art, language and nature. And her family and friends will remember her for her loyalty, her honest communication and her elegance. Contributions may be made to the New York Public Library, or the Rondout-Esopus Land Conservancy of Accord, NY.
