        KONDRACKE--Millicent M. The Board of Directors and staff of The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research mourn the passing, and celebrate the life, of Millicent (''Milly'') Kondracke, wife of Board member Morton Kondracke. Milly's steadfast spirit and her willingness to share her personal battle with Parkinson's will continue to inspire and educate people everywhere about the disease's devastating effects. We will miss Milly terribly, but her impact on the entire Parkinson's community will live on. Our heartfelt sympathy goes out to Milly's entire family, but especially to her husband, Morton, and their daughters Alexandra and Andrea.
