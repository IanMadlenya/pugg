        SPANO-Rose. The residents and staff of The Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale note with sorrow the passing of Rose Spano, beloved mother of our dear friend, Andrew Spano, Westchester County Executive.

We extend our condolences to Andy, Brenda and the entire family, and pray that they will be comforted by fond memories. The Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale Daniel Reingold, Exec. VP
