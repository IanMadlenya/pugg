        CORRELL--James Sr., MD. The Department of Neurological Surgery of the New York Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University notes with sadness the passing of Dr. James W. Correll in Hampstead, NC on Friday, March 26, 2004. Dr. Correll spent his entire career in our Department from 1955-1987. He made many contributions to the understanding of the pathogenesis of stroke and advanced the field by his extensive laboratory studies on the role of the autonomic nervous system and lipid release. He was one of the pioneers of surgery on the carotid artery to prevent stroke which led to the broader understanding of the prevention of this disease. A busy and indefatigable surgeon, beloved by his patients, a surgical pioneer, and a mentor to numerous medical students and neurosurgical residents, he made a lasting mark on our department, the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center and the field of neurosurgery. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his wife Cynthia, daughter Catherine, son William, their spouses and his five grandchildren. The Department of Neurological Surgery New York Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University.
