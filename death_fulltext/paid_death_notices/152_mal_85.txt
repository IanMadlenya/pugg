        WEIDLINGER-Paul. We deeply regret the passing of our stellar founding principal, Paul Weidlinger, on Sunday, September 4, 1999. At a time when most of his contemporaries had long ago retired, he was still exploring the frontiers of structural engineering and continued to do so until shortly before he died. His engineering genius and scientific curiosity propelled him, and us with him, into numerous fruitful collaborations with leading architects, builders, scientists and artists of the 20th century, with whom he had many personal friendships. We are grateful for his leadership and pledged to represent the future of his unique interest in engineering possibilites, that led him to develop advanced structures yet to be built and materials yet to be employed. Matthys Levy, on behalf of the Board of Directors and staff of Weidlinger Associates, Inc.
