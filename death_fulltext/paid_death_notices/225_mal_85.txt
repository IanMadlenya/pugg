        DUSENBERRY--Bernard. 64, died October 6, 2005 after a brief illness. He was a longtime resident of Brooklyn and for 20 years, one of New York's Finest; a highly decorated detective in the NYPD. Honest, compassionate, brave, he was without doubt one of the most decent people you could ever hope to meet. His kindness, generosity, and willingness to help others stands as a shining example for all of us. We'll always remember Bernard as a good-hearted, good-humored, good-natured father, husband, uncle, brother, and loyal friend. He is survived by his devoted wife, Eleni, and his loving children, Christopher, Laura and Keith; his brothers Phil, Harry and Joseph, and his sister, JeanMarie Driscoll; his son-in-law, Chris Johnson. Reposing Monday from 2-5 and 7-9 PM at the Marine Park Funeral Home, 3024 Quentin Rd, with a funeral mass Tuesday at 9AM at Good Shepherd R.C. Church, Avenue S and Batchelder St, Brooklyn. Interment will follow at St. Charles Cemetery in Farmingdale, L.I. We'll miss you, Bern. You were one of the best.
