        WEISS--Lawrence S., born in New York City, November 7, 1921, son of Alexander and Bess Weiss has passed to a better place May 3, 2007 after a brief but difficult illness. Loving, devoted husband, father, and grandfather, he was admired, loved and respected by all who knew him. A child of the depression, member of ''The Greatest Generation'', he graduated from City College of New York. After graduation he served his country with pride and honor in World War II as a Lieutenant in the Army Air Corps. Following the war, he completed post graduate training in Optometry at Columbia University, and began to pursue his career. Larry met and married his lifelong partner, the love and light of his life, Alice in 1958. The couple settled in Jackson Heights, NY, and raised two children, Jeffrey and Carla. He passed on his zest for life, his diverse interests, and his continual quest for knowledge to his children and grandchildren. His life was his family, and that remained so until his passing. His spirit remains in all of our hearts. We will all be together again one day. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made in Larry's memory to the Hospice Care Network, 99 Sunnyside Boulevard, Woodbury, NY 11797.
