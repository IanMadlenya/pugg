        OTANI--Isako. Our wonderful mother, grandmother, great grandmother, and friend, passed away on November 29, 2004 at the age of 98. Born Isako Makino on November 10, 1906 in Iida, Japan, wife of the late Sadao Otani, M.D., and mother of Michiko Weller (late David), Hiroko Kiiffner (Calvin), and Emy Otani. Proud grandmother of Robin Snowden (Richard) and Paul Weller (Leslie), she took joy in her great grandchildren Laura Snowden and Audrey and Nicholas Weller. Son-inlaw Calvin was undeniably her best pal. Also survived by her devoted niece Kazuko Ito of Tokyo, nephew Y. Katagiri (CA), and the Makino and Matsumura families. A true Meiji-era woman, she exemplified courage, grace, and inner strength. A keeper of the Japanese language, she valued education and the arts, interests nurtured as an elementary school teacher in Japan. Her sense of humor was legendary. The NY Mets and Rachael Ray have lost a devoted fan, though she vowed to keep an eye on them from above. She asked to be remembered to friends and family here and in Japan, with thanks for her wonderful life. We are grateful to Dr. Peter Hofmann and to her devoted nurses-Colleen, Winnifred, Lenore, Robbie, Jackie, and Jael-who gave her such loving care. We will miss her dearly. A memorial service will be held at 2:00 p.m. on Saturday, December 11, 2004 at the Japanese American United Church, 255 Seventh Ave., NY, NY 10001. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Church or to your favorite charity.
