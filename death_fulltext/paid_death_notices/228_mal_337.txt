        CUMELLA - Charlie. Our hearts cry out in profound sorrow at the loss of our dear friend, Charlie. The world is diminished and its light darkened by his passing.

As we mourn his loss, we extend our heartfelt condolences to his devoted wife, Annie and his wonderful children, Charlie Jr., John and Sal. We will miss him forever.
