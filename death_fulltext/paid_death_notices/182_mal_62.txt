        SMITH-Charles Buchanan. Our elder partner, Charlie Smith, died suddenly in Delray Beach, Florida on February 24, 2002 at the age of 77. We mourn his passing. Charlie was born in New York, December 3, 1924, served his country in the Pacific Theater in W.W. II, completed his education after his return from that duty, and than served his clients and this law firm as a feisty, wise counselor and friend from 1951 to 1995. He is survived by his wife Beverly Cox Smith, son Christopher B. Smith, granddaughter Jessica, and grandson Shawn, to all of whom we extend our deepest sympathy. Fish & Neave
