        PRISANT-Millard. The Officers and Trustees of the Roslyn Preservation Corp. and the Roslyn Landmark Society mourn the loss of their dear friend and dedicated officer. For over two decades, Millard enthusiastically participated in the preservation projects of the unique village of Roslyn, be it the handling of salvaged architectural items, the repair of antique hardware, or the climbing of the scaffold to paint the clock face of the village's Ward Memorial clock tower. A strong supporter of the programs of both organizations, he generously shared his years of experience in preservation and restoration techniques and antique connoisseurship. He and his wife Carol spearheaded many preservation efforts, as well as hosting numerous meetings and events in their historic home. Millard's generosity extended beyond his donation of time and talent. He willingly made many generous contributions to assure the completion and success of the various projects undertaken by the two organizations. His cheerful, enthusiastic and dedicated presence amoung us will be greatly missed, but the restoration of many of Roslyn's historic buildings will serve as a permanent and silent memorial to his esteemed memory.
