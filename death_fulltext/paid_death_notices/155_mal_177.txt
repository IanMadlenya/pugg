The result was extraordinary support for the work of the Center. This accomplishment has and will continue to benefit untold numbers of cancer patients. We will miss Peter's intelligence, caring and quiet grace. We extend our heartfelt condolences to the entire Baida family. Paul A. Marks, MD, President. Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
