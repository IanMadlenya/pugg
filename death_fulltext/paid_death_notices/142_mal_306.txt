        HOULIHAN-Daniel J. Manhattan College acknowledges with profound sorrow the passing of Daniel J. Houlihan, Sr. '41, renowned alumnus, generous benefactor, valued advisor and good friend. Educated by the Christian Brothers at Manhattan, Dan devoted his extra time and energies to Catholic educational causes. One of a long line of Jaspers, including his father Joseph '09; Dan's love of faith, family and community was truly admirable. We at Manhattan College extend our heartfelt condolences to Dan's wife, Kathrene, and their nine children.
