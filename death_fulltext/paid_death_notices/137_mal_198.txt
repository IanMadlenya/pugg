        GUNSBERG-Sheldon. The Board of Directors and Staff of the Film Society of Lincoln Center note with profound sorrow the death of our Vice Chairman and beloved friend. Sheldon Gunsberg was among the founders of the Film Society in 1968. As an officer of the Walter Reade Foundation, he implemented the naming gift which launched our theater and worked devotedly with our staff and architects for nearly a decade, during all stages of the planning and building process. His support and enthusiasm were unstinting-his integrity and understanding of the true purpose of our organization made him an invaluable Board member and an indispensable sounding board for our staff. Our sense of loss is overwhelming and we send heartfelt condolences to his wife Lois and all the members of his especially loving family. Roy Furman, Chairman Irwin W. Young, President Joanne Koch, Exec. Dir.
