        MALOY--Laurence. Of Santa Fe, New Mexico, passed on peacefully on December 30, 2005 at Saint Vincent's Hospital, in Santa Fe, New Mexico. He was 69 years old. He leaves a legacy of boundless love, devotion and admiration for the arts, which throughout his wonderful life served as the focal point for all his accomplishments, the gathering of friends where stories regaled, and the education of many communities along the way. Everyone admired his passion and focus for promoting one of the life's truly timeless achievements; the gift of classical and operatic music. A graduate of Wagner College in Staten Island, New York, and loving husband to Barbara Boyd Maloy who preceded him in 1989, Laurence Maloy's historical legacy traveled through the Metropolitan Opera in New York City to the Worcester Art Museum in Worcester Massachusetts and then back to the American Arts Counsel in Manhattan. Even after his retiring to Santa Fe, after living most of his life in New York City, was he a constant promoter and advisor on the subject and history he loved. As a member of the Board of The Santa Fe Desert Chorale he assisted in bringing the Chorale into an era of heightened stability and artistic success. He is survived by his two children, Andrew Boyd Maloy of Chesapeake, Virginia, and his daughter Clare Corby Maloy (Barry) of New York City, New York.
