        GUTIERREZ -- Gerald. The Board and Staff of Lincoln Center Theater are deeply saddened and mourn the death of our beloved colleague and esteemed Associate Director. Gerry performed theatrical miracles of direction on the Beaumont stage, most recently with his acclaimed production of ''Dinner at Eight''. His productions of ''Ivanov'' and ''Abe Lincoln in Illinois'' also revealed his mastery of the thrust stage configuration that had proved so challenging in earlier times. Gerry's other distinguished and prizewinning productions for our theater included ''The Most Happy Fella'', ''The Heiress'', ''A Delicate Balance'' and ''Ring 'round the Moon''. Gerry was smart, funny, irascible, visionary and oh, so talented. His sudden departure rents the delicate fabric of our theater and we are profoundly grieved. Wake on January 1, 2-5, 7-9pm, Marine Park Funeral Home, 3024 Quentin Rd, Brooklyn. Funeral Service St. Ann's Episcopal Church, 157 Montague St, Brooklyn, 10:30am Friday January 2. John B. Beinecke, Chairman Andre Bishop, Artistic Director Bernard Gersten Executive Producer
        GUTIERREZ -- Gerald. The Staff and Board of Playwrights Horizons joins the entire theatrical community in mourning the sudden, devastating loss of our esteemed colleague and beloved friend, Gerry Gutierrez. For three decades Gerry brought his exhilarating wit, piercing intelligence and passionate idealism to new work on our stages with a creative vision as epic as his craft was exacting. Gerry's love of theater was matched in intensity by his love of politics, music, baseball and dish. His generosity of spirit enlarged and inspired all of us who had the privilege to know and work with him.
        GUTIERREZ -- Gerald. The Acting Company is saddened by the passing of one of its founding company members. A brilliant director whose death is a loss to the theater. We extend our sincere condolences to his family. Margot Harley, Producing Artistic Director The Acting Company
