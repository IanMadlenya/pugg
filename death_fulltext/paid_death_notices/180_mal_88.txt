        HETTENA-Ran. The officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the loss of Ran Hettena, a cherished friend of UJA-Federation who was committed to Jewish and humanitarian causes. Through his involvement in the Recanati Foundation, Mr. Hettena was a great supporter of Israel, medical education, the arts, and Jewish welfare throughout the world. Mr. Hettena's wife, Shirley, is also dedicated to helping those in need. We extend our deepest sympathies to Mr. Hettena's sons, Avi & Seth, & their families; to his sister, Dina Recanati; & to the entire Hettena & Recanati families. Larry Zicklin, President Morris W. Offit, Chair of the Board John S. Ruskay, Exec VP & CEO
