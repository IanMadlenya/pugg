        GOOTMAN-Dr. Norman. We mourn the passing of our father, Dr. Norman Gootman. He was a devoted and loving husband of the late Phyllis M. Gootman. Beloved father of Sharon Rosen and Craig Gootman. Cherished grandfather of Joshua and Nathaniel Rosen, and Alexandra Gootman, and friend to many. Our father's devotion was felt throughout our lives, as he successfully balanced his family life with his professional life. He was Chief of Pediatric Cardiology at Schneider's Children's Hospital of Long Island Jewish Hospital, where he also conducted cardiac research with our mother. His loss will be felt by all who knew him. We will miss you very much, Dad. Graveside services Thursday, October 25th, at the Hungarian Union Fields Cemetery, Cypress Hills, New York.
