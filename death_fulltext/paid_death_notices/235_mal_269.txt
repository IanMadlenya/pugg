        LAWRENCE--Morton B. Our friend and mentor, teacher and inspiration. He will always hold a place of honor in the hearts of those of us whose lives he touched. At a luncheon several years ago, he quoted from Henry V, and we all felt proud to be among his band of brothers. From this day to the ending of the world, he shall be remembered. And the sun shall greet him and draw his honors up to heaven. Lisa Linden Steven Alschuler Linden Alschuler & Kaplan
