        MILLER--Kenneth. For 58 years a foreign correspondent, oil analyst and competitive swimmer, died March 21 in Manhattan at 83. A recent retiree after 14 years as consulting editor at Bloomberg News, he spent most of his career with Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, starting in 1965. He built his reputation on covering the oil nationalizations of the 1970's, and served as executive editor from 1983-88. In 2002, OPEC cited him for journalistic excellence. His father, Webb Miller, was a leading war correspondent. The dapper man, seldom without coat and tie, was educated in Europe before attending Princeton University, class of 1944, interrupting his classes to serve as an Army artillery and infantry officer. In early 60's, he was foreign press adviser to the new Republic of Congo. He leaves his devoted wife of five decades, the former Helene Glavani of Athens, and dozens of friends and oil industry associates worldwide.
