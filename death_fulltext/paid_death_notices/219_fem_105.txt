        LLOYD--Marion Musser. The President and Board of Trustees of Vassar College note with deepest sorrow the passing of Marion Musser Lloyd, Class of 1932, a former trustee of the College, and an alumna whose lifelong devotion and service to Vassar has engendered the greatest of admiration and affection on the part of her alma mater and all those who knew her. We extend our condolences to her daughter Mary Lloyd Estrin, Class of 1966 and current trustee of the College, her grandchildren Zoe Estrin, Class of 2000 and Jesse Estrin, Class of 2006, and the rest of her family.
