        MORRIS--Craig. It is with profound sadness that the Trustees, President, curators and entire staff of the American Museum of Natural History mourn the unexpected death of Dr. Craig Morris, Curator in the Division of Anthropology and longtime Dean of Science at the Museum. The loss to the Museum, to the scientific community, and to so many of his colleagues is indescribable. Dr. Morris was a world-renowned scholar of the highest order whose contributions in anthropology and archaeology earned him membership in the National Academy of Sciences. He was an extraordinary leader of the Museum and an exceptionally wise colleague-a pillar of the Museum community. A brilliant scholar, always a gentleman, and a dear friend to many of us. He will be sorely missed. The funeral will be held at the JH Churchill Funeral Home in Dr. Morris' hometown, Murray, Kentucky, and a Memorial will be held at the Museum at a future date. Lewis Bernard, Chairman Ellen V. Futter, President
