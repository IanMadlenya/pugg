        RUANE--William J. Columbia University Medical Center is grateful for the contributions and foresight of William J. Ruane, whose philanthropy has built a lasting legacy in our Department of Psychiatry. We were fortunate to be among the many beneficiaries of Mr. Ruane's generosity. His charitable donations made possible the Columbia Teen Screen program, which was unique in that it has directly applied Columbia's remarkable psychiatric research to the well-being of teenagers and their families in 450 communities across the United States. His support also endowed three professorships in the Department of Psychiatry and funded research and other programs in child psychiatry. We extend our sympathy to the Ruane Family. Gerald D. Fischbach, M.D. Executive Vice President, Columbia University Medical Center Dean, Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons
