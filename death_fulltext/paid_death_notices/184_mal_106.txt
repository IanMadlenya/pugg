        AUCOIN-Kevyn. The Board of Directors and staff of the American Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR) mourn the loss of our cherished friend and longtime volunteer and supporter Kevin Aucoin. A preeminent master of makeup artistry, Kevyn was celebrated for his uniquely understated and creative style. As an activist, Kevyn also searched for ways to exert powerful, transformative change. We salute his steadfast commitment to fighting intolerance and injustice on all fronts and are grateful for his spirited work on behalf of AIDS research and his generous support of amfAR over the years. We fondly remember Kevyn's great personal warmth and exuberant approach to life, as we extend our heartfelt condolences to his partner Jeremy Antunes and to his entire family.
