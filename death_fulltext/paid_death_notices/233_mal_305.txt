        MOSS--Dr. Melvin L. Former dean of Columbia University Medical Center's College of Dental Medicine, professor emeritus of anatomy and oral biology in the College of Physicians and Surgeons, and professor emeritus of dentistry, passed away on Sunday, June 25, 2006. Dean Moss' visionary leadership shaped the school we have today, and his death is a great loss to us all. Dean Moss was a 1946 graduate of Columbia's dental school, and received his PhD in anatomy, specializing in physical anthropology from Columbia in 1954. He joined the Columbia faculty in 1952, and was well known throughout the medical center as an outstanding teacher of human anatomy to generations of medical and dental students. A prolific researcher, Dean Moss' work on the theoretical basis of craniofacial growth and development received international recognition. His appointment in 1968 to lead the dental school initiated a period of renewal and new directions in the dental school. Under his leadership, the school received more resources for strengthening dental education through investment in facilities and faculty recruitment. Dean Moss also made significant changes to the curriculum, and oversaw the creation of several new divisions with the dental school. Our thoughts and prayers are extended to his wife and our colleague, Dr. Letty Moss-Salentijn, professor of dentistry and senior associate dean in the College of Dental Medicine, to his two sons, Noel and James, and to his granddaughter Kristina. A memorial service will be held on Wednesday, June 28, 2006, at 11:15 A.M. at The Riverside, Amsterdam Avenue & 76th Street, NYC. Interment will be private. In lieu of flowers, Dr. Moss-Salentijn has requested that donations be made to The Melvin L. Moss Scholarship Fund, payable to Columbia University College of Dental Medicine, 630 West 168 St., New York, NY 10032. Ira B. Lamster, D.D.S., M.M.Sc.
