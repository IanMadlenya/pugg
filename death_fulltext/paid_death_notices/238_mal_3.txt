        GROLLMAN--Dr. William K. We mourn the passign of Bill Grollman, our co-founder and longtime leader. Bill was a friend, mentor, teacher and inspiration to an entire generation of accountants and educators. All those whose lives he touched will remember his limitless energy and unending optimism even in the face of adversity. He made us feel as though we were all part of his family. We extend heartfelt condolences to his wife Gail, his children and grandchild and all of his loved ones. Board of Directors and Employees of SmartPros LTD
