Served in the British Army for seven years and in the Hagana and Israeli Army for three. His entire life was spent working for Israel and the Jewish people.

        EBSTEIN-Yehuda. The officers, staff and Board of Directors of the National Committee for Labor Israel (NCLI) mourn the passing of our esteemed colleague. We recall a lifetime of commitment and dedication to the Jewish people and to the State of Israel. Having escaped Germany's rampage through Europe, he fought with the British Army, helped organize Jewish refugees for emigration to Palestine during British rule, and later joined Israel's defense forces. Among his many achievements in communal life, he worked for the Jewish Agency in Jerusalem and the Development Corporation for Israel. A life-long Labor Zionist, Yehuda organized major fundraising campaigns for NCLI, and after nearly thirty years of distinguished service, retired from professional life as NCLI's Executive Vice President. His insights, his warmth and his passion will be greatly missed. Our sympathies go to his beloved wife Shoshonna, his children, Aviva and Gila, and their families. May his memory be for a blessing. Jay Mazur, President Jerry Goodman, Exec. Dir. Ann Stamler, Assoc. Exec. Dir.
