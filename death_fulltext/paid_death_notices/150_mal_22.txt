        BERNARD-Eileen. The board of directors, other volunteers, and staff of the United Hospital Fund express their deepest sympathy to Herbert Bernard, our esteemed honorary and former director, as well as to his entire family upon the death of his loving wife of 65 years. Eileen was a source of light and strength to all who knew her, and shared with Herbert the strong values of charity, community, faith, and family. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family. Howard Smith, Chairman James R. Tallon Jr., President
