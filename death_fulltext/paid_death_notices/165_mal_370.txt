        ZAWISA-Bernard J. Artist and Professor Emeritus, Department of Art, Southern Connecticut State University, on October 3, 2000, in Los Angeles County, California, of complications from a brain tumor. He was born in Middletown, Connecticut on May 12, 1925. After serving in the US Air Corps in WW II he received his BA in 1949 from Wesleyan University and his MFA in 1954 from the University of Iowa. He joined the SCSU faculty in 1958 and until his retirement in 1992 was an inspiring teacher of design, painting, color, the philosophy of art and independent study in painting and color. He organized and proposed courses in color, water based media in painting and the philosophy of art. His paintings, collages, and sculptures won major prizes and honors. He was influenced by the color and light of spring and autumn in the New England landscape and extensive travels in Egypt, China, the Middle East, Europe and California. Mr. Zawisa exhibited widely in New England, Los Angeles and NYC. Critics state that his use of color is luminous and intriguing and his abstract and thematic figurative canvases are fully controlled yet expressive and aesthetic rhapsodies of composition. Mr. Zawisa's work has been described as arresting, inventive, distinctive and intellectual in concept. His quiet and sincere manner, pleasant disposition and brilliant, but unpretentious, creativity is missed painfully by his family, friends, colleagues and former students. Burial was in Calvary Cemetery, Middletown, Connecticut.
