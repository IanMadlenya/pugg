        SLATER-Dionne Ryan. The Trustees, Advisors, and staff of the Wildlife Conservation Society mourn the passing of Fellow Advisor Dionne Ryan Slater. Dee Slater was a tireless advocate for all of WCS's activities and cared deeply about everything from the animals at the Bronx Zoo to WCS's conservation programs around the world. She began her involvement almost three decades ago, and served on the Women's Committee, the International Conservation Committee, and the Board of Advisors. Dee was a valued member of the WCS family, and we extend our deepest sympathies to her husband, Sandy, and her children and grandchildren. She will be greatly missed. David T. Schiff, Chairman William G. Conway, Pres.
