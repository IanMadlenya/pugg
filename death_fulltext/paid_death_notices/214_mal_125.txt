        LEVY--Albert Lederer. My beloved Albie, passed away November 4, 2004 after a valiant battle. He was a most special man who was proud to share his birthday with Winston Churchill, Mark Twain and Jonathan Swift. He practiced law for 53 years in Passaic, N.J. where he was born and in Clifton, N.J. where we shared 40 beautiful years. Sleep well my love, I will treasure you always. Barbara
