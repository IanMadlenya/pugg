        CLARK--Anne Rogers. The Board of Governors, the officers and members of the Westminster Kennel Club deeply mourn the passing of their friend and colleague, Anne Rogers Clark, truly one of the premier people in the sport of purebred dogs. A New York native, she was the first woman professional handler to win in Best In Show at Westminster (1956), and eventually handled two more BIS winners. Later, as an allbreed judge, she became the only person ever to have judged Best In Show (1978) and all seven Groups at Westminster. Contributions may be made in her name to Take The Lead, PO Box 6353, Watertown, NY 13601, or to the Poodle Club of America Foundation, 2945 Jamestown Road, Long Lake, MN 55356.
