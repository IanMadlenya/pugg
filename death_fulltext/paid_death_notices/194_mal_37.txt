        ABRAMS-Martin, M.D. It is with sadness that we acknowledge the untimely death of our friend and colleague, Dr. Martin Abrams. Dr. Abrams was one of the founding pediatric surgeons on Long Island. He served with distinction as a member of the staff of Pediatric Surgery at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center for over 40 years. He played a vital role in the establishment of the Schneider Children's Hospital. Dr. Abrams was a cultured gentleman with many interests and a talented surgeon. He had an outstanding ability to interact with his patients, their families, peers, members of the nursing staff and everyone with whom he came in contact. He was a man of humor and integrity and was loved by his patients and respected by his peers. The faculty and staff of the Schneider Children's Hospital mourn his passing and the Department of Pediatrics acknowledges the loss of one of its finest doctors. Condolences to his loving wife Marie, his children and grandchildren. Philip Lanzkowsky, MD Executive Director Schneider Children's Hospital
