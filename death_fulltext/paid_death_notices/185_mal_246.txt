        SCHIMEK-Dr. Jean. The Institute for Psychoanalytic Training & Research (IPTAR) mourns the loss of our esteemed colleague and friend, Dr. Jean Schimek. A valued member of our Faculty and Board of Administrators, he served as Chair of Curriculum. He had also been a Professor at Downstate Medical College, Yale University and New York University. He was the ultimate scholar, reseacher, teacher and psychoanalyst. He will be remembered for the many colleagues and students he mentored and inspired as well as for his enduring contributions to the fields of psychology and psychoanalysis. Our most heartfelt condolences to his wife Debra, his sons David and Paul and his grandchildren.
