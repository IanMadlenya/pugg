        JAROSLOW -- Fred. The North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System mourns the passing of our esteemed friend and colleague, Fred Jaroslow. A quiet, dedicated, generous professional who made his mark in the business world as the chief operating officer of Weight Watchers International and chairman of Playorena, Inc., Fred provided invaluable expertise as a trustee of the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, serving on numerous committees and contributing countless hours of his time and talent. He had been a trustee of the Long Island Jewish Medical Center Board since 1985. A devoted husband, father and grandfather, he is survived by his wife, Ruth; three daughters, Karen Siris, and Amy and Elizabeth Jaroslow; and six grandchildren, Joshua, Jeremy, Benjamin, Emily, Morey and Jake. Fred will be greatly missed but never forgotten. Roy J. Zuckerberg, Chairman Michael J. Dowling President & CEO North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System >>AD#
