Born on March 9, 1913 on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, he had a long and productive career in the glass industry, primarily as a labor activist. As chief executive of Local 1087 of the Glaziers' Union in NYC, he instituted a broad and progressive benefits program and initiated one of the first apprenticeship training programs for racial minorities in the construction trades. In his mid-60's, after retiring from the union, he became president of the Knickerbocker Plate Glass Corp., and developed the business into one of the largest plate glass replacement companies in NY, continuing in an active management role until his death. During this period he was also a Trustee of the Pension Fund of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, a position he also retained until his death. He is survived by his wife Anne, with whom he recently and lovingly celebrated their 65th wedding anniversary, his son Ira and daughter Cora, his favorite daughter - in - law Trude, son-in-law Al, six grandchildren, David, Andy, Peter, Mark, Sally and Jud, their partners and spouses, Cathy, Gloria, Rachel, Julie, Michael and Susan, and nine great-grandchildren, Ashley, Shelby, Corey, Rachel, Aiden, Nealie, William, Hannah Rose and Jack.

He made the most of what little was given to him and as one of his grandchildren said, he had a lot to be proud of at the end.
