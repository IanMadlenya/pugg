        RICH-Gordon Alexander. We mourn with our cherished friends of more than 45 years, Evie and Marv, his beautiful Swarthmore sweetheart, wife MaryAnn, and his beloved buddies, sons Max and Alex. From his first day of life, he was extraordinary. Cousin Gordie to Lois and Lila, always in our hearts. Ruth and Sam Perelson, Lois and Stewart Perelson Gross, Lila and Keith Adwar.
