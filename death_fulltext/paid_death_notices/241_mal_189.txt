        SHAIN--Arthur, D.D.S., M.P.H., age 93, died peacefully on February 12, 2007, after a short illness. He is survived by his wife of 65 years, Elinor, his daughters Carol Romanello and Jo-Ann Shain, grandchildren Denise Adiletta, Paul Colman and Aliya Shain, great-grandchildren Matthew and Carol Ann Colman, and Gabriel and Shawn Adiletta, and his ''third'' daughter, Dr. Mary Jo Kennedy. A graduate of NYU and Dalhousie University Dental School in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Arthur resided and practiced dentistry in New Rochelle, NY, for nearly 55 years. He furthered his education at Columbia University School of Public Health, receiving his MPH degree in the late 1970s, and achieving the distinction of possibly being the School's oldest graduate at the time. Arthur proudly served as an adjunct assistant professor of dentistry and instructor at the Columbia University School of Medicine and Dentistry. Arthur was a unique individual who loved life and lived it to the fullest. He had a passion for learning, reading widely and trying new things. He traveled the world, visiting Australia, New Zealand, London and mainland China. Arthur loved good wine, fast cars, and considered himself to be an expert on most subjects. He had strong opinions and did not hesitate to share them, but most of all, he had a big heart and always strived to be the best person he could be. Interment was on February 13, at Mt. Eden Cemetery in Hawthorne, NY. Please consider a donation in Arthur's name to the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.
