        BERNSTEIN-Zalman. The Boca Raton Judaic Fellows Program and the Yeshiva High School of Broward, Dade, and Palm Beach County mourns the loss of one of the great Jewish leaders of our generation, Zalman Chaim Bernstein. Zalman was not only a visionary, he gave life to his dreams by creating the Avi Chai Foundation. His commitment to all Jews served as a role model of tolerance and ''Ahavat Chinam'' for the Jewish community. I will always be in his debt for the times he sat with me in his efforts to guide, support and advise. May his wife Mem, mother, Martha and his children Claude, Leslie and Rochel Leah be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Israel. Rabbi Kenneth Brander, Dean
