        WEAVER-Sylvester L. (Pat) Jr. We mourn the loss of our dear friend and MDA president from 1975 to 1979. A visionary in the field of broadcast communications, Pat began his association with MDA in 1967. His broadcasting genius helped guide the expansion of the Labor Day Telethon to its present status as a national institution which immeasurably benefits tens of thousands of families served by MDA. We remember him with heartfelt gratitude and extend condolences to his family. Robert M.
