        GAMSON-Dr. Bernard W. The Yeshiva University family is saddened by the passing of a longtime friend and supporter, distinguished scientist, industrialist, and leader of the Jewish community, and a founding member of the Yeshiva College Board of Directors-serving as cochair of its Academic Affairs Committee. He was on the organizing committee for our Sy Syms School of Business. With his wife, Deborah Sobel Gamson, he was a YU Guardian and Fellow of YC, SSSB, and Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. They established scholarships at YC, SSSB, and our affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary. We extend heartfelt condolences to his wife, Deborah; children, Mark (and Sandra) Gamson, Michael Gamson, Miriam (and David) Cohen, and Alan Gamson; grandchildren; and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University David S. Gottesman, Chairman YU Board of Trustees Jay Schottenstein, Chairman YC Board of Directors
