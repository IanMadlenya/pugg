        RIZZO-Peter Cyrus, M.D. The Board of Trustees, Medical Staff, and Admistration of the Hospital for Special Surgery mourn with profound sorrow the death of their Honorary Staff member Peter Cyrus Rizzo, M.D., whose lifelong dedication to the field of orthopedics began when he entered the Hospitals's residency program and went on to join its staff. His two sons, the late Dr. Peter C. Rizzo, and Attending Staff member Dr. Thomas D. Rizzo, followed their father into the Hospital's residency program and went on to become highly respected orthopedic surgeons as did his grandson Dr. Peter F. Rizzo. The eldest Dr. Rizzo's work in orthopedics contributed greatly to the progress made in that field and earned him the respect and admiration of his colleagues. During his long career he treated many thousands of patients not only with skill and expertise but also with limitless kindness and compassion toward them and their families. Dr. Rizzo's devotion to his profession has inspired generations of doctors who strive to follow his example of selfless service and has engendered the love and gratitude of those patients who benefited from his knowledge. He will be greatly missed and long remembered by all fortunate enough to have known him. We extend our deepest sympathy to the entire Rizzo family. Richard L.
