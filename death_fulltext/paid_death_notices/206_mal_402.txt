        ROSENTHAL--John P. John was one of the good guys of life. My business partner of 24 years and friend of 35 years, he was warm, kind, generous and caring to all around him to a degree rarely matched. My frequent doubles partner and sometimes opponent, he was enthusiastic and competitive on the tennis court just as he was in all aspects of his life. My wife Carol and I loved him dearly and will miss him deeply. To know him and to be his friend was an honor and a privilege that we cherish. Our heartfelt condolences to Jackie and the entire Rosenthal family. Irwin, Carol, Ronnie Suzanne Silverberg
