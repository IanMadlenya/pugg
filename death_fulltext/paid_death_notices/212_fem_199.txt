        B00C0CK -- Glenn Winnett. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of Glenn Winnett Boocock, an Honorary Director and a great friend to our company. ''Dougie'' Boocock was a member of The Metropolitan Opera Board of Directors from 1967 until 1976, when she was elected to The Met's first group of Managing Directors. She was named Honorary Director in 1985. Over many years, she was a graceful, gracious and always welcome presence in this house. We extend our condolences to her daughters, Susanna and Leslie, to her grandchildren and to her many friends. Beverly Sills, Chairman of the Board Mrs. Ezra K. Zilkha, Vice Chairman of the Board William C. Morris, President Joseph Volpe, General Manager
