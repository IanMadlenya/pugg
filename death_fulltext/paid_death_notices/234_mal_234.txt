A distinguished drama critic for the Saturday Review, he was Past Chairman of the Margo Jones Award Committee and was a Founder of the American Theatre Critics Association, the American Theatre Wing's Design Awards (now named in his honor), and the Drama Desk. He was an early host of ATW's Working in the Theatre Seminars, and was inducted into the Theatre Hall of Fame in 2002. A dedicated champion of theatre in all venues, he will be greatly missed.
