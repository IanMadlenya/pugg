        HIRSHFIELD - Susan, 60, passed away on Friday, June 23rd, in her Manhattan apartment. Susan spent two decades as an actress, during which she stared as Zenobia, in an Off-Broadway production of ''Ethan Frome.'' She later founded Quoi De Neuf, a fine jewelry business whose pieces grace many of the best dressed women of the world. A woman of impeccable taste, Susan loved all things beautiful. She was a tenacious tennis player, an avid reader, a beach loafer, and a devoted friend, mother and wife. Susan knew how to live life to the fullest and inspired those around her to do the same. Thoughout a courageously fought 16-year battle with cancer, Susan always pursued pleasure and never looked back. She is survived by her adoring husband Peter Hirshfield, her loving daughters, Lauren and Victoria, her beautiful mother Ellen Levy, and her devoted brother Charles Levy. A memorial service will be announced for September at a later time.
