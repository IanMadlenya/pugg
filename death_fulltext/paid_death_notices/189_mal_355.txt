        LERNER-Alfred. The President and Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York express deep sorrow at the passing of Alfred Lerner, a member of the Columbia College class of 1955. He was a respected colleague whose leadership as vice chair of the Trustees was marked by exceptional insight, unfailing decency, and dedication to his alma mater. Alfred Lerner Hall, Columbia's innovative student center, was made possible by his generosity to the University. Columbia University extends its profound sympathy to his wife, Mrs. Norma Lerner, his son Randy, his daughter Nancy, and to his seven grandchildren. Lee C. Bollinger, President of the University David J. Stern, Chair of the Trustees
