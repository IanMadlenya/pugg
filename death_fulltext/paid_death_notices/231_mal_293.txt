        HERSHFIELD--George. In memory of George Hershfield who was a beloved friend and co-worker and was a mentor to us all at Louis Glick & Company. His was a life not only of unflagging dedication to his work, but of complete love and devotion to his family and one that embodied cheerful optimism, happiness and goodwill. It was a deep privilege to work with him and his smile will be sorely missed by coworkers and clients alike. May his memory be a source of heavenly blessing.
