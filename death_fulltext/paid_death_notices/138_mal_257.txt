        ZUCKER-Henry L. The Officers, Trustees & staff of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee express their deep sorrow at the loss of Henry L. Zucker, a long time Honorary member of the JDC Board & a leader in American Jewry. Henry served JDC overseas after World War II and conducted the first International Survey of Operations for JDC. In addition to his JDC activities, he was the Executive Director of the Jewish Community Federation of Cleveland for 27 years, and will be remembered as one of the most influential and effective Jewish leaders of his generation. A man who brilliantly and creatively pursued the objective of a more humane, more effective, a more supportive society, his loss will be deeply felt. Our condolences to his family and to his wife Ellen. Jonathan W. Kolker, President Michael Schneider, Executive Vice President Ambassador Milton A. Wolf, Chairman of the Board
