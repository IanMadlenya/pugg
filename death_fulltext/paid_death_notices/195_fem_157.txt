        HELLER-Grace. The Yeshiva University family mourns the passing of a deeply beloved graceful lady whose devotion to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine Gift Shop was unique and unequaled, and whose service to the cause of higher Jewish education, in which she was a full partner with her late beloved husband, Frank Heller, Esq., was manifested in their support of Yeshiva University as Guardians. Heartfelt condolences are extended to the Heller, Corbin, Gewandtler and Robinowitz families. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University Ronald P. Stanton, Chairman, YU Board of Trustees Robert A. Belfer, Chairperson AECOM Board of Overseers
