Condolences to his wife, Laura, to his children Andrea (and Rabbi Neil) Winkler, Bart (and Mariola) Nierenberg, and Jonathan (and Alissa) Nierenberg, to his brother, Michael Nierenberg, and to his 9 grandchildren, and 5 great grandchildren. May the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel, President Norman Lamm, Chancellor Morry J.
