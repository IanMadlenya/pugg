        MAASE-Charles Peter. On Tuesday, May 12 in the company of friends and family at the home of his parents in Brockville, Ontario, at the age of 49 years. Beloved son of Charles A. and Janet E. Masse of Brockville. Dear brother of Jill Maase and her partner John Richardson of Ottawa, and John Maase and his wife Wilda Madden of Brockville. Also survived by his niece Lily Elizabeth Richardson Maase. Peter's great style, humour, creativity, and loving friendship will be greatly missed by all who knew him. We are grateful for the kindness and care of so many of Peter's friends during his difficult and prolonged illness. In accordance with Peter's wishes, there will be a private cremation and interment service in Montreal. A memorial service will be planned at a later date in New York City, where Peter resided for the past 26 years. In remembrance, donations to Friends In Deed, 594 Broadway, Suite 706, New York City, NY, U.S.A. 10012 would be greatly acknowledged.
