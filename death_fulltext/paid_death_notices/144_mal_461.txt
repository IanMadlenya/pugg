        EVERDING-August. The Metroplitan Opera deeply mourns the death of August Everding, who created five of our most successful and acclaimed productions. His imaginative use of the Metropolitan's great stage, backed by a superlative mastery of modern stage techniques, brought vividly to life our new production of ''Tristan und Isolde'' for his 1971 debut. As well as a striking ''Lohengrin,'' he created productions which are still favorites of our audiences today, such as his magnificent ''Boris Godunov'' and ''Der Fliegende Hollaender.'' His much-admired production of Mussorgsky's ''Khovanshchina'' will be revived in March. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Gustava and his four sons.
