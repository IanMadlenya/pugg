        ORENSTEIN-Leo L., M.D. The faculty and staff of NYU School of Medicine and the NYU MEdical Center mourn the passing of Leo L. Orenstein, M.D., Clinical Professor of Psychiatry. A 1934 graduate of NYU School of Medicine, Dr. Orenstein was a member of the School's faculty for over sixty years. Dr. Orenstein was a dedicated teacher and a gifted physician who maintained a private practice in psychoanalysis and psychiatry. A researcher in forensic psychiatry and in alcoholism, Dr. Orenstein also conducted pioneering work on the treatment of schizophrenic patients. He is survived by his children, Jane and Joe Meyer and Reed L. and Arlene Orenstein; his sister, Bertha Greenberg; his former son-in-law, Mayer C. Liebman, M.D., four grandchildren and one greatgrandchild. We extend our deepest sympathies to his entire family. Robert M. Glickman, M.D. Dean NYU School of Medicine Theresa A.
