        REINHART-Stephanie. Kevin McKenzie, the Trustees, the dancers and the entire staff of American Ballet Theatre mourn the passing of Stephanie Reinhart, a brilliant advocate of dance. Her tireless dedication to the art form lent encouragement to an entire generation of dance ensembles. We send our deepest sympathies to Charles, Ariane and their family.
