        TOMASHOFF--David. Dear Helen and family, your grief is profound but your memories of your beloved husband, father, grandfather are golden and everlasting. He was always a picture of elegance, his ties were always a classic, as were our own personal ties in doing business together. May the entire family be comforted with the mourners of Zion and remember that someday we will all be together. With sincere condolences, Milton and Marlene Feldman
