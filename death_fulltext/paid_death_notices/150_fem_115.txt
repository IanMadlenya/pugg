        HEALY-Eileen. The six NYC Independent Living Centers, founders of the New York Independent Living Consortium, deeply mourn the passing of our cherished colleague and friend. We shall miss Eileen's wisdom, intelligence, cunning wit, leadership, dedication and charm. No one ever ran a meeting like Eileen. Her skillful expertise of plowing through Board agendas and reaching consensus was quite unique. Her seat at the head of our table is now empty but we pledge that the work she helped start will be continued. Deepest sympathy to her family, friends and the countless number of people with disabilities who knew and loved this outstanding lady.
