        KAMINETSKY-Dr. Joseph. The Yeshiva University family expresses profound sorrow on the passing of a visionary leader in Jewish education for over half a century who-as founding president of Torah Umesorah-pioneered the development of the Hebrew Day School movement in North America. A member of Yeshiva College's first graduating class-the Class of '32-he was an honored authority on Jewish education and lectured widely in this field. He served with distinction as associate professor and chairman of the Jewish education department at our former Graduate School of Education. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Selma; children; and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University David S. Gottesman, Chairman Board of Trustees
