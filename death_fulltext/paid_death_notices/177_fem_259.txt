        FISCHMAN-Marian, Ph.D. We are much saddened by the death of our esteemed colleague and friend, Dr. Marian Fischman, who, throughout a productive and distinguished career, made unique and valuable contributions to research on substance abuse. Her research was innovative and vital, and the methodological advances from her laboratory over the years have been adopted by many colleagues engaged in drug abuse research nationwide. As a colleague, a mentor and a friend, Dr. Fischman was an inspiration to all. She was a rare person. John M. Oldham, M.D. Director New York State Psychiatric Institute
