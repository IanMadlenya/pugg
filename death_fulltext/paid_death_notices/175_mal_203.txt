        NAAMA-Hassan, M.D. The Faculty and Staff of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City, the Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar, NewYork - Presbyterian Hospital and the Department of Surgery of New York Weill Cornell Medical Center are deeply saddened by the passing of our dear friend and colleague Hassan Naama, M.D. An exceptional young surgeon, Dr. Naama had completed his surgical residency at New York Weill Cornell Medical Center in July and subsequently joined the full-time faculty and staff of the Department of Surgery. Dr. Naama had already accomplished much in his brief career and undoubtedly had a bright future, making his untimely death all the more tragic. We mourn his passing and extend our heartfelt sympathies to his family. A memorial service will be held on Thursday, August 23, at 9 a.m. at New York Weill Cornell's Uris Auditorium, 1300 York Avenue (69th Street). A memorial fund is being established in Dr. Naama's name. Gifts should be made payable to the Surgical Residents' Fund-with the memo notation ''The Hassan Naama Memorial Fund''-and sent to the Surgical Education Office, Box 207, 525 East 68th Street, New York, NY 10021.
