        HILL-Jessie Leonard. Our deepest sympathy to her son Sam, brother Charlie Leonard, sister Laura Ault, and her extended family. ''May the road rise to meet you. May the wind be always at your back. May the sunshine warm your face, the rain fall softly upon your fields, And until we meet again, may God hold you in the palm of his hand. Amen.'' Fondly missed, Your Nurses
