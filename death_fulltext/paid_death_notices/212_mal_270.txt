        SCHEUER -- Walter. The Swarthmore College community mourns the loss of its distinguished and beloved alumnus Walter Scheuer. Wally, individual connection by individual connection, helped build a global world and, through education, business, music, dance, and film, succeeded in bridging difference on a world scale. He was a philanthropist not only of resources but of confidence, courage, personal engagement, shared vision, and delight, who helped free Swarthmore and so many institutions to be their best selves. In 1998, fifty years after his graduation from Swarthmore, Wally honored the College by accepting an honorary degree. He spoke to the graduates of the grand adventures to come. He asked them to carry with them their hopes, their dreams, and the goodwill of their families and classmates. He charged them to be happy, to be loving, to keep their sense of humor, and always, always to be free. He urged them to make a difference, to engage life, to be messengers of peace. Experiencing the impact of his genius to connect and to empower, the graduates rose to salute Wally with one of the rare standing ovations in the history of Swarthmore commence ments--and then went off to infect the world with the powers Wally had so lovingly released in them.
