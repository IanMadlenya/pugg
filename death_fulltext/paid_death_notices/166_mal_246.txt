        HITCHCOCK-Ethan Allen. The Board, staff and volunteers of Thirteen/WNET New York express their sorrow at the passing of our former Chairman of the Board, Ethan Allen Hitchcock. Serving on the board since 1967 and serving as Chairman from 1968-1980, Ethan Allen Hitchcock presided over the station during an evolutionary period. During his tenure as Chairman, Thirteen created some of the legendary series that have become the hallmark of public television, including Great Performances, The Newshour and Bill Moyers' Journal. We are all the grateful beneficiaries of his dedication and committment to public television. Our sincere condolences to his wife, Mari, their children and family. Steven Rattner, Chairman William F. Baker, President
