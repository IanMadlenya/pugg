        KESTEN--Seymour R. A professor and author noted for his studies of utopian colonies, died last November in Palo Alto, California. He was 78. His death was announced by his sons, Philip and Randy. Mr. Kesten was born in Brooklyn and attended Richmond Hills High School. Upon returning from service in the Navy, he attended LIU, later receiving his BA in Fine Arts from SUNY New Paltz. In the intervening years, he owned and managed a wine and liquor store in Belrose, Queens and founded and operated a printing and publishing firm, Pastoral Press, in Grahamsville, NY. He received an MA in Musicology and a PhD in Humanities from Syracuse University. His research in that period focused on Beethoven's use of humor, Wagner's Ring Cycle, and American Studies of the early-to-mid 19th century, while serving as an instructor at Utica College, Cayuga County Community College and Syracuse University. He later was an assistant professor at Augusta College, Lake Superior State University and LaSalle College. He retired from teaching in 1991 to focus on research and writing. ''Utopian Episodes: Daily Life in Experimental Colonies Dedicated to Changing the World,'' a work that grew out of research he had begun in the 1970's, was published in 1993 and is considered a seminal work on the subject. At the time of his death he was working on two further manuscripts relating to this time in history. Mr. Kesten's wife of 50 years, Rose Edith (Posner) Kesten, had died two months prior to his death, on their 50th wedding anniversary. He is survived by his sons, his daughters-in-law Kathy and Kirsten, and his grandchildren Sam, Chloe and Jamie. He is remembered by them and those who knew him as a humanist-concerned with people, how they live, what they do and what they believe.
