        SCHWEITZER-Dorothy C. of Wayne, PA., formerly of Roslyn Heights, N.Y. on April 9, 2000 in her sleep, after a long illness. Beloved wife of the late Dr. Martin. Devoted mother of Seth, Lawrence (Beth), Sarah Leah, & Jane (Douglas). Adored grandmother of Aaron, Eric, Jenny, Emily, Benjamin and Max. Dorothy Schweitzer was professor emerita of anatomy and physiology at CUNY for twenty years and at Lenox Hill Hospital School of Nursing for ten. She previously taught biology at Brooklyn College. She published pharmacology research at CIBA and helped develop techniques in micromanipulation that ultimately led to cloning. She was an award-winning orchid grower and president of the Long Island Orchid Society. But most important to Dorothy Schweitzer were her four children, who all grew up to be successful professionals. Her triumphs over calamities, bureaucracies, setbacks, and illness are too numerous to mention here, but helped shape our characters and ethical standards. To us, she was the gold standard, a brilliant, take-charge woman to the end, yet always humble about her talents. Funeral services are on Tuesday, April 11th at 12 noon, at Sunset Chapels, 1285 Northern Boulevard, Manhasset, N.Y. In lieu of flowers, please make contributions to the American Cancer Society.
