        PATTON--Henry. The Board of Directors of The Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Foundation mourn the passing of their fellow Director, Henry Patton. He served the Board, and the community in New York City and in Palo Alto, California, with great distinction. We will miss his wise counsel, his friendship, and his dedication. We offer our deepest sympathy to his family. Oscar S. Straus II Chairman Oscar Straus Schafer President >>AD#
