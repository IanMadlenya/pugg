        LEV-Adelaide. Peacefully on September 16 at home in San Francisco. Returned to rest in New York City beside her beloved Leon. Much loved mother of Jane (Stefano), sister of Nora (Bob) and Lester (Pearl). Profound thanks to Aster and visiting nurses and Hospice, San Francisco (Paula, Daphne and Shirley). Addy dear, we will miss you.
