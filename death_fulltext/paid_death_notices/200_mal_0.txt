        ABPLANALP--Robert H. The Trustees, Officers, faculty and staff of Fordham Preparatory School mourn the passing and pay tribute to the life and service of Robert H. Abplanalp, '39. It was Mr. Abplanalp's ambition to build a home for Fordham Prep to call its own. It was Mr. Abplanalp who saved the Prep when financial circumstances threatened the school in 1978. Our heartfelt sympathy goes out to his wife, Josie, his son, John, and his daughter, Marie. James F. Murray, '63, Chairman Joseph P. Parkes, S.J., President
