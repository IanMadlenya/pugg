        CLARK-R. Inslee, Jr. The Horace Mann Community sadly mourns the loss of its esteemed colleague and longtime friend R. Inslee Clark, Jr., who served both as Headmaster and President of Horace Mann from 1970-1991. During his two decades of service his impact on the school was great. He not only oversaw the merger of Horace Mann with both the Barnard School and New York Nursery Years, but he also reintroduced co-education to the school. A brilliant, dynamic teacher, he taught an Urban History course and took students into prisons and courtrooms to learn first hand about the complex urban issues confronting New York City. His inspirational leadership, his ebullient personality, his devotion to the thousands of students he reached out to and his personal commitment to Horace Mann are remembered by all of us. His impressive intellect and passion for baseball are legendary. He was a man of true valor and we will miss him. We extend our sincere condolences to his brothers Jonathan, Christopher and Anthony. Services will be at 10 AM Saturday, August 7, at Christ Church Riverdale, 5030 Henry Hudson Parkway, Riverdale, N.Y. Michael D. Hess '58, Chair Board of Trustees Dr. Eileen Mullady Head of School
