        MESSERSCHMITT -- John. The Central Park Conservancy Board of Trustees expresses its sincere sympathy to Betsy Messerschmitt, a Vice President of The Women's Committee Board of Directors, on the death of her dear husband John. John, like Betsy was a true lover of Central Park and an enthusiastic participant in its restoration. He served his country during WWII, was a successful businessman and always found time to serve the non-profit community on boards and in other volunteer capacities. His warmth and genuine good humor will be sorely missed. The Board of Trustees of the Central Park Conservancy

Both Betsy and John have been great supporters of the Park for the past two decades. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family.
