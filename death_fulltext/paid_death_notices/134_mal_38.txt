        FLOYD-J.A. (Joe) The Board of Directors and Staff of Christie's International, PLC, are deeply saddended by the loss of J.A. Floyd, former Chairman, friend and colleague who served the company with distinction for forty-five years. Joe played a pioneering role in Christie's North American operations, particularly the opening of Christie's New York Office in 1977. He will be greatly missed.
