        HALL--Evelyn A.J. (Mrs. Melville Wakeman). The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art and its International Council mourn the loss of Evelyn A.J. Hall, who had been a member of the Council since 1970 and a Trustee of the Museum since 1979. At the Museum she chaired the Library Committee and served on the Education Committee, as well on the Trustee Committee on Prints and Illustrated Books. She enriched the Museum's collection with work by Pierre Bonnard, Pablo Picasso, Joan Miro, Ellsworth Kelly, Louis Valtat, Edouard Vuillard, and, in a particularly notable gift made with her late husband, William Jaffe, with a selection of sixteen prints by Edvard Munch. Her gentle graciousness, quiet generosity, and sparkling presence will be missed. We extend our sympathies to her entire family.

Lowry, Director The Museum of Modern Art, NY Brian Urquhart, Chairman Emeritus Agnes Gund, Chairman Jo Carole Lauder, President The International Council of The Museum of Modern Art
