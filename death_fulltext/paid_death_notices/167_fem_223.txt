        SCHAFLER-Rubelle. Congregation Rodeph Sholom mourns the death of our longtime devoted member and benefactor Rubelle Schafler. We will miss her passionate devotion to the beauty and well being of our Temple. As loving wife of the late Norman Schafler, who served with great distinction as our President, and beloved companion of Mike Nathans who chaired our Cemetery Committee, she was an ever present partner in our sacred work.
