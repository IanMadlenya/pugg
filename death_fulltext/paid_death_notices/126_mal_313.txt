        ZARETSKY-Professor Barry Lewis. The Brooklyn Law School Community mourns the loss of a beloved colleague, distinguished scholar, esteemed teacher and great friend. His legacy as an educator exceeds the sum of the books and articles he wrote, the classes he taught and the law reforms he urged. Over the past two decades he has touched the lives of thousands of students, lawyers and friends. Although his presence will be missed, it will be long felt. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Joan Glatman, his children, Arielle, Joseph and Tamar, his parents, Harold and Edythe Zaretsky; his sister and brother-in-law, Sandy and Robert Kanin and his entire family.
