        BORGE-Victor. The American Jewish Committee remembers with great affection and enduring admiration Victor Borge, a man who embodied the rare and wonderful qualities of genuine humor, deep compassion, and true humanity. We are especially grateful for Mr. Borge's gift of performance that enabled us to partake of his exceptional spirit and enriched our lives. AJC was deeply honored to recently become affiliated with Thanks To Scandinavia, the scholarship fund founded by Mr. Borge and New York attorney Richard Netter to thank Scandinavians for rescuing Jews during the Second World War. Through the foundation, we are committed to keeping Mr. Borge's memory-and his vision-vibrant for future generations. Bruce M. Ramer, President David A. Harris, Exec. Director
