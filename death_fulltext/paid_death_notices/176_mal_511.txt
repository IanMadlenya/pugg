        LIFSHITZ-David. Quietly passed away at 98, leaving Dora, his cherished wife of 69 years, his beloved children Marilyn and Bob, Esther and Seymour, Naomi and Stanley, eight adored grandchildren, and five beautiful great-grandchildren. He was a rugged individual who walked through life with a quiet confidence, envying no one. He will be missed as much as he was loved.
