        WILLIS--Ellen. The sisterhood of History in Action, a group of multigenerational feminist activists wishes to express our grief at the loss of Ellen Willis, activist, scholar, warrior, visionary and sister. Her brilliant writings have informed and inspired us. She felt as strongly about sexual freedom and abortion rights in 2006 as she did when she spearheaded the women's liberation movement in 1968. History in Action owes it existence to Ellen's efforts to correct the erasure of our history, specifically coverage commemerating the legalization of abortion in New York State that barely mentioned the women's movement's role. HIA will continue to honor Ellen's memory with a renewed commitment to women's liberation.
