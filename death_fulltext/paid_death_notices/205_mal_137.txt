        CARPENTER -- H. Daniel. Hudson Guild marks with great sadness the passing of Dan Carpenter, age 95. Dan joined the Guild in 1931, serving as executive director from 1943 until 1973. Upon his retirement he served as a trustee for 18 years. His impact on the Guild and on Chelsea was extraordinary; in addition, he was a major leader in the Settlement House movement and a true pioneer for many social issues, most notably affordable housing. Dan was admired for his wit, astuteness, and tenacity and was consulted by many even after his relocation to Arizona last year. Lee Buckley, President Paul F. Balser, Chairman Janice McGuire, Executive Director
