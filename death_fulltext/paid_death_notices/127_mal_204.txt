        KAUFTHAL-Leo. The leadership and staff of UJA-Federation mourn the passing of Leo Kaufthal; cherished father, beloved husband, Holocaust survivor, role model for the community. His dedication to those who needed help was as passionate as his devotion to his family. He was a righteous person who passed on a world of Jewish values to his children, Uri, Judy, Ilan and Linda, and grandchildren, Jonathan, Jeremy, Joshua, Daniel, David and Josh. Mr. Kaufthal's generosity of spirit and openness of heart has been continued by his caring family as ardent supporters of UJA-Federation. To his wife, Edith, and his entire family, we send our deepest sympathies. May you be consoled among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair Louise B. Greilsheimer, President Stephen D. Solender, Exec. V.P.
