        PAPP--Steven M. Steven Papp was Deputy Director for Administration at New York State Psychiatric Institute for 25 years. He was also, for a number of years, the Director of Administration of the Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene, Inc at the NYSPI and an Associate Vice President in the Faculty of Medicine of Columbia University. His extraordinary administrative talents and creative leadership were instrumental in developing & maintaining the excellence in research, education and clinical care for which NYSPI is known. In an intricate and complex environment, Steven Papp was a master in balancing the urgent and competing needs of researchers and clinicians, State and University, patients and staff. His daily virtues included fairness, tolerance, tenacity, patience with essential minutiae, impatience with humbug, and a tremendous sense of humor. He is dearly loved by all who had the opportunity to work with him. His wit, wisdom, and huge fund of institutional knowledge will be sorely missed by the entire PI communmity. The loss of Steven Papp as colleague, friend and mentor at PI is second only to the loss to his family of a wonderful husband, father, son, and brother. Our hearts go out to the Papp family along with the assurance that Steven Papp will live on in the memories of his co-workers and in the history of this Institution. B. Timothy Walsh, M.D. Interim Director NYSPI
