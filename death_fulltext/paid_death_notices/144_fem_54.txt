        FARBER-Viola. The Board, staff and artists of the Danspace Project mourn the loss of Viola Farber, a master teacher and unique presence in our community. Her spirit, though sorely missed, will live on in the many dancers whose lives and work she has touched. Karen Brosius, President Laurie Uprichard, Exec Dir.
