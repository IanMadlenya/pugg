        ELIAS--Albert J. The Board of Directors, volunteers, consumers and families of United Cerebral Palsy of NYC send our heartfelt condolences to the family of Albert J. Elias, known affectionately as ''Hemmingway.'' Albert Eline was a long time supporter and member of the board. He was an Honorary Board Member at the time of his death and is already sorely missed. Until their move to FL, Albert and his wife Rea attended, and enlivened, every UCP/NYC event. We extend our deepest sympathy to the entire family, but especially Rea and his son Albert; who worked at UCP/NYC from 1979 until his retirement. Martin C. Hausman, President Edward R. Matthews, Executive Director Ronald J. H. Napal, Chief Development Officer
