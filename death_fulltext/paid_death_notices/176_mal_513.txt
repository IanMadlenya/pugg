Over the past fifteen years, he distinguished himself as a Vice President & Partner at Cantor Fitzgerald. Most recently, he joined Cantor's Tradespark division for the opportunity to develop new markets in the growing field of energy futures. A devoted husband, doting father, and loving son, Mr. Lunden possessed a veritable penchant for life. He is best remembered by his family and friends for the radiance of his ever-present smile, the vivid aquamarine color of his engaging eyes, and the inordinate magnitude of his heart. Mr. Lunden graduated from Fairfield University in Fairfield, Connecticut where he earned his BS in Finance in May 1986. He was a longtime member of the New York Athletic Club and a parishioner of St. Paul the Apostle Catholic Church on the Upper West Side, as well as Our Lady of Good Counsel in Cutchogue, NY. A Memorial Mass will be held in his honor on Friday, September 28th at 3 PM, at the Church of Our Savior, 59 Park Avenue in New York City. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be directed for the benefit of the Matthew J. Lunden Education Fund, c/o Merrill Lynch, 5500 Sears Tower Chicago, IL 60606.
