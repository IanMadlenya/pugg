        CARSWELL -- Donald. The Trustees of the Poly Prep Country Day School deeply mourn the passing of Donald Carswell, a loyal and invaluable servant and leader of the institution. For nearly four decades, Poly benefited from his expert financial guidance and deep commitment to the highest quality in education. He was a champion of ensuring access to Poly Prep to all of merit who deserved admission. As Treasurer and then Chairman, his leadership provided the rationale and encouragement for unprecedented growth at the school, including the development of the Poly Prep Lower School in Prospect Park. Notably, illness did not slacken the pace of his contributions. He will be sorely missed. Our deepest condolences are extended to his wife Lois and family.
        CARSWELL -- Donald. The Brooklyn Hospital Center is deeply saddened by the passing of its esteemed Trustee, Donald Carswell. In 1960, Mr. Carswell joined the Board of Caledonian Hospital in East Flatbush, Brooklyn where he served until 1982 when Caledonian Hospital merged with the Brooklyn Hospital Center. Since then, Mr. Carswell has served on the Board of the Brooklyn Hospital Center and was a member of its Executive Committee and Chairman of the Board of the Brooklyn Hospital Foundation. The Board of Trustees and the entire Brooklyn Hospital family extend their deepest sympathy to the Carswell family.
