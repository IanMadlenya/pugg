        SAMOT--Dorothy. We extend our sincerest condolences to Barbara (and Morrie) Libman and David (and Robin) Samot on the loss of their beloved mother. Her great passion for music and deep sense of devotion to family instilled in her children, grandchildren, and greatgranddaughter a strong sense of values and cherished memories of their times together. May the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. American Committee for Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem Family
