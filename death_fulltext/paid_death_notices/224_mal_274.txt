        MARSHALL--Melvin. March 10, 1922--September 26, 2005. Mel lived his life by offering the benefit of the doubt, he put his wife and children first. He was a man for whom family meant everything and whose life could only be measured as a fabulous success. Noted raconteur, his booming voice and jovial nature were well known and well loved. He will live on in the hearts and memories of his wife Edith & his children Jeremy and Jennifer and Bill and Sabrina, his adored granddaughters Julian & Cameron and beloved grandsons Max and Simon as well as his extensive extended family and friends. A celebration of his life is planned for November. We will be at home for callers Wednesday-Saturday.
