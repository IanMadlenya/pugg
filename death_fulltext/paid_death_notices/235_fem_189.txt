        MILLER--Pearl C. After the sudden passing of her reveared uncle Elias A. Cohen, on July 2, 1952, Pearl dedicated over 50 years of her life to his Tranquillity Farm and Camp. Leading by example and putting others before herself, Pearl taught thousands of boys and girls how to live, play and work together. She brought out the best in anyone fortunate enough to meet her. Following Pearl's example, and in the spirit of ''Noblesse Oblige,'' her adoring family, the dedicated staff, a grateful alumni and so many loyal friends are all helping to perpetuate Tranquillity Camp as an enduring monument to this great leader. Together, we will do our best to ensure that all generations of Tranquillity's children will mark this day as one to remember our beloved ''Pearl'', the ultimate teacher. The Tranquillity family is proud to announce the successful completion of our 88th Camp season on August 24, 2006. Tranquillity Camp, Inc.
