        LISKOFSKY -- Sidney. The American Jewish Committee mourns the death of Sidney Liskofsky, a distinguished and beloved member of our staff for nearly half a century before his retirement in 1992. Sidney was instrumental in drafting some of the most important international human rights instruments and was engaged in every aspect of developing the U.N.'s human rights program. In 1971, he became the Founding Director of our Jacob Blaustein Institute for the Advancement of Human Rights to help institutionalize universal human rights standards and monitoring. He devoted his professional and personal life to the welfare of the Jewish people and to insuring human rights and dignity for all. He will be sorely missed. We send heartfelt condolences to his family and many friends. E. Robert Goodkind, Pres. David A. Harris, Exec Dir
        LISKOFSKY--Sidney. The Jacob Blaustein Institute for the Advancement of Human Rights express profound sorrow at the death of Sidney Liskofsky who shaped and led the Institute to distinction in the years 1971 through 1992. Before human rights became prominent in foreign policy, Sidney successfully and relentlessly promoted UN adoption of new norms and measures to combat religious intolerance, racial discrimination, and other abuses, and efforts to educate a cadre of experts to carry on this work. We are proud to continue in his footsteps. Our deepest condolences to his family and friends. Robert S. Rifkind, Chairman Felice D. Gaer, Director
