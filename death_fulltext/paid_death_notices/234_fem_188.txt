        WALLACE--Marilyn S. Author, teacher and mentor, loving wife, adoring mother and true friend, Marilyn slipped away painlessly Saturday morning, July 29th, after battling cancer with her typical grace and strength. She is survived by her husband Bruce, her two sons Mark and Jeremy, her sister Karen, her brother Steven, her father Irving Weiss, and a legion of friends and other loving family. She asked to be remembered only with fondness. A celebration of her life will be held in August. She will be dearly missed.
