        MORRIS-Ethel. Patient, caring, enduring wife of Joseph and mother of Jeff and Bob. The embodiment of selflessness, even as she struggled through her last years, she will be missed as the devoted listener of her family. Her sisters Phyllis and Beverly, daughter-in-law Janet, and grandchildren Madeleine and Ian, and many others will miss her quiet compassion, brave spirit, and flawless matzoh ball soup. Services today, 2 PM, Bayshore Jewish Center, 26 North Clinton Avenue.
