        CARY--Guy. The Board of Trustees and Staff of the Wildlife Conservation Society are saddened by the death of our long-time friend and generous benefactor. Guy Cary joined the Board of Trustees in 1968 and was named an Honorary Trustee in 1999. He served on many important committees and in particular was a highly valued and respected member of the Investment Committee; additionally, he was a key advisor on the CIRS Pension Benefits Plan. His wise counsel and dedication provided strong leadership for WCS. We extend our deepest sympathies to his family. David T. Schiff, Chairman Steven E. Sanderson, President & CEO
