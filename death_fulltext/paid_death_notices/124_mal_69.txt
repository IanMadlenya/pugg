        RABB-Norman. The Brandeis University Community mourns the death of a cherished founding father. For 50 years, Mr. Norman Rabb devoted his imagination and wisdom to the task of bringing this precious new academic asset to a place of dignity in the family of American universities. He was the youngest of the eight Founding Trustees of Brandeis University and the first Secretary of the Board. He served as Chairman of the Board from 1961 to 1967, when the University underwent its greatest period of expansion. In 1956, together with his brothers and other members of the family, Mr. Rabb supported the construction of the Graduate Center which bears the family name. The Rabb School of Summer, Special and Continuing Studies is named in honor of Mr. Rabb and his wife, Eleanor. In appreciation of Mr. Rabb's leadership and generosity, the University awarded him the honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters in 1958, the Medal for Distinguished Service to Higher Education in 1967, and the Jacob A. Goldfarb Medal in 1981. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Eleanor, his daughters, Hope and Jane, his brother, Irving, his sister, Jeanette, and his entire family. Jehuda Reinharz, Pres. Barton J. Winokur, Chairman, Board of Trustees
