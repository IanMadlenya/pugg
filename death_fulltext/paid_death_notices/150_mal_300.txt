        SHERMAN-Monroe Age 94, formerly of Long Boat Key, FL and Southbury, CT, died peacefully at home on Thursday, July 15, 1999. Brother of the late Barney, Maurie, Herman and Sidney. Adored husband and life's partner of the late Gertrude Horn; treasured father of the late Nancy (Dr. Lawrence) Rosenberg and Susan Sherman; beloved grandfather of Eric Rosenberg, Connie (Mark) Hochman, Dr. Mark Rosenberg (Dr. Andrea Needleman), Elizabeth (Dan) Zimmerman; Loving greatgrandfather of Amelia and Sarah Hochman; Julian and Jenna Rosenberg, and Natalie Rose Zimmerman. Metallurgist, inventor, golfer, chef, jeweler, artist, photographer, master gardener. Impassioned autodidact and perennial student of the patterns and miracles in nature, of etymology and philosophy, of quantum physics, of music and art. His kindness and generosity, his love for and absolute devotion to his family and friends, his passion for creative work, the thrill he found in being alive and in his myriad interests, have lastingly endowed and inspired all who knew him. ''I am done with great things and big things, great organizations and big successes. I am for those tiny, invisible, molecular, moral forces which work from individual to individual, creeping through the crannies of the world like so many soft rootlets, or like the capillary action of water, but which if you give them time, will rend the hardest monuments of man's pride''. (William James) Memorial service at 10:00 AM on Wednesday, July 28 at Pomperaug Woods, Southbury, CT.
