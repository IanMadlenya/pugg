        TONER--Kathleen, IHM, on November 19. Samaritan House mourns the passing of our founder, inspiration, and friend, Sister Kathleen Toner. In 1984 Kathy created in Brooklyn the model home for homeless women and children. She developed the home, ran it and--most vitally-lived in it. Her vision helped turn around a city that once warehoused thousands of homeless mothers and children in the worst of welfare hotels to a city that finances scores of residences with supportive services for women and children in need. We will always remember and be inspired by her brilliant mind, her sense of humor, her loving heart, and her fierce protection of those most in need. Calling hours Sunday, November 23, 2-8 PM. Mass Monday, November 24, at 10:30 AM, Marian Convent, Scranton, PA.
