        BITENSKY - Samson. The American Committee for Shenkar College in Israel mourns the passing of Samson Bitensky, a member of our Board of Directors and a Governor of the College. The Halina and Samson Bitensky Textile Technology Laboratory was established to prepare students for industry. As a benefactor of many aspects of the college, Samson recently provided a rooftop recreation area for students and faculty which will be dedicated this week at the college. His steadfast support and encouragement will be sorely missed. We offer our deepest condolences to Halina, his children, Beth and Susan, and their families. David Pernick, Chancellor, Shenkar College of Engineering and Design Prof. Amotz Weinberg, Pres. Bruce Pernick, Pres., American Committee Charlotte A. Fainblatt, Executive Director
