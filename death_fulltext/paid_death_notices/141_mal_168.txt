        AMORY-Cleveland. in his 81st year. The officers, directors, staff and volunteers the world over mourn the sudden death of our founder, President, and guiding intellect and spirit. Mr. Amory founded the Fund for Animals in 1967 and has led it every inch of the way while tirelessly continuing his career as a best-selling author. We will of course continue to serve animals, large and small, all of whom he loved, but without him it won't be the same. We will not see his like again. Memorial service to be announced. The Fund for Animals
        AMORY-Cleveland. Founder and President of The Fund for Animals, the organization that spoke for those who could not. A wonderful man who cared deeply about animals and their humane treatment, he was a great man who will be sorely missed. With love and affection, Leonard and Allison Stern.
