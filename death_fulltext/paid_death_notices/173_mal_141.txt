        JERRY-Harold A. Jr. We mourn the death of Harold A. Jerry, Jr., a passionate advocate for the East's last great wilderness, the Adirondack Park. A former state senator, he served three decades on the Public Service Commission, and on numerous conservation organizations. Governor Nelson Rockefeller appointed him to lead the effort that created the Adirondack Park Agency in 1968, a landmark in Adirondack protection. His heart was in the Adirondacks, and he lived his life with an absolute and single-minded urgency to protect the freedom of our few remaining untamed places. Our condolences to his family. The Adirondack Council, The Adirondack Nature Conservancy/ Adirondack Land Trust, The Association for the Protection of the Adirondacks
