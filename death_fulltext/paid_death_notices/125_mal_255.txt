        CHURCHILL-W. Philip. We mourn the passing of our elder partner, Phil Churchill. He served this law firm and its clients faithfully for 44 years, from 1935 to 1979, interrupted by military service in World War II. Phil provided friendship, wise counsel and guidance to many, including his partners. We extend our sympathy to his wife, Polly and to his sons Bill, John and Jim. FISH & NEAVE
