        NOYES--Jansen, Jr. Cornell University mourns the loss of a devoted alumnus, trustee emeritus, eleventh chair of its board, and presidential councillor, Jansen Noyes Jr. His sharp business acumen, commitment to philanthropic interests, and ardent dedication to Cornell will long be remembered. The third in a line of five generations of Cornellians, Noyes made an indelible mark on the university's history. He was elected to the Board of Trustees in 1961 and served as chairman from 1978 until 1984, and in 1985 was named a Presidential Councillor. He also served as a member of the Board of Overseers of the Weill Cornell Medical College. Noyes was a remarkable leader who will be missed by the entire Cornell community. We express our sincere condolences to his wife, Dorothy (Dottie) O'Day Noyes; his sons, Michael O'Day Noyes and Jansen Noyes III '69; and his beloved grandchildren, Jansen Noyes IV, '04, Jennifer and Logan Brackett. Peter Meinig, Chairman, Board of Trustees Jeffrey S. Lehman, President, Cornell University
