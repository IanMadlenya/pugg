        FREEDMAN--Martin, of Mt. Vernon, NY died at his home in his sleep on February 9, a few months short of his 100th birthday. Born ''Mottle'' in 1907 in Linkuva, Lithuania, he came to America penniless via Ellis Isle in 1921 and from a humble East side peddler's cart evolved a top of the line Broadway men's haberdashery retail store ''Martin Freedman.'' He then founded the ''Fairfield Shirt Co'' to design and fabricate men's custom and pleated dress shirts. Although lacking formal education himself, he encouraged his surviving two children (Gerald, Rita) and five grandchildren (Adam, Gweneyth, David, Julia and Sarah) to all attain advanced academic degrees. He was a man of uncommon intellect, strength and robust health and became part of the Einstein College of Medicine Longevity Study Group (NY Times June 27, 2000.) His experiences and memories of the Lower East side in the 1920's and 1930's were sought after by historical groups documenting the era. He was a delightful story teller with a keen memory and a warm, compassionate view of human nature. He was the oldest active member of the Free Synagogue at his death. He was predeceased by his beloved wife Adele and survived by his sister Minnie.
