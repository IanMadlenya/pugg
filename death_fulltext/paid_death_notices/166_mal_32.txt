        WEISBERG-Robert David. The Clergy, Officers, Board of Trustees, and the members of the Ocean Parkway Jewish Center announce with profound sadness the passing of their beloved President, Robert David Weisberg, Esquire. Robert D. Weisberg served the Ocean Parkway Jewish Center as President for almost twenty years. He was raised in the synagogue and spent his entire life deeply attached to ''his'' synagogue. He was an attorney of great distinction and a gentleman of great compassion. He served his country proudly in World War II, in the US Army Air Corps. He is survived and sorely missed by all, especially by his mother Tillie, wife Roslyn, daughters and sons-in-law Eileen and Dr. Barry Blutig, Phyllis and Neil Greenblum, as well as by his five grandchildren. May the Lord count them among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
