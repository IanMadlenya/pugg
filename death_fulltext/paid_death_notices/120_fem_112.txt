        GLASER-Lee Babin. Died on January 13, 1997. We have lost a dear relative and friend whose long life of style, wit, and imagination brought pleasure to all. A creative advertising executive, she was even more creative in her generous and caring relationships with her family and friends. She was the devoted wife of the late Henry Glaser, loving sister of the late Micky Aronsohn of New York and Elmer Babin of Cleveland. She will be missed by her nieces Toni Perlberg and Judith Kaufman, nephews Alan Aronsohn and Anthony Babin, their families, and her great host of friends.
