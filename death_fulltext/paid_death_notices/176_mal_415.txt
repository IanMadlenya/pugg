        SANDLER-Herman, 57. Loving husband of Suki, devoted father of Pamela, Gillian and Jordana, role model and mentor to hundreds of young people. You encouraged us to take risks and gave us innumerable opportunities to follow our dreams, cheering us on as we learned to impact the world as you did so powerfully. You will always remain our awesome inspiration. We love you, Suki, Pamela, Gillian and Jordana. In lieu of flowers, gifts honoring Herman may be made to any of the following organizations: American Friends of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, The Rain Forest Foundation, The Perlman Music Program, Carnegie Hall, or UJA Federation of NY.
        SANDLER-Herman. The Rainforest Foundation co-founders, Trudie Styler and Sting, Chairperson Franca Sciuto, Board of Directors and staff wish to extend their deepest, heartfelt sympathy to Suki Sandler and the Sandler daughters Pamela, Gillian and Jordana, the family of our beloved friend and supporter, Herman Sandler, who died tragically at the WTC on September 11. Since the Rainforest Foundation's beginning, over a decade ago, Herman was there to share his vast knowledge and to lend his encouragement and support. His contribution and commitment over the years were a vital force to aid our mission to help indigenous peoples of the world in their fight for freedom. His spirit, generosity, exuberance and love of humanity will live forever in our hearts and inspire us always.
        SANDLER-Herman. The Trustees and staff of Carnegie Hall mourn the loss of Herman Sandler, a beloved member of our family who was taken too soon. His boundless energy and enthusiasm will be deeply missed. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to Carnegie Hall Trustee Suki Sandler, and to our friends and Carnegie Hall Council Members Pamela, Gillian, and Jordana Sandler.
