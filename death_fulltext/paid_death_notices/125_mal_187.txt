        BLOS-Peter. It is with deep sadness that the New York Freudian Society mourns the death of Peter Blos, Ph.D. A member of our society for many years, Dr. Blos was a leading psychoanalytic thinker. He was also a poet. His breadth of interest spanned the life cycle, although he was a pioneer in his work on adolescent development. Psychoanalysis will miss his wise counsel. Harriet I. Basseches, Ph.D.
