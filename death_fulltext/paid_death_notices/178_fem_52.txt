        MARTIN-Allis Beaumont. I mourn the loss of my spiritual mother, Allis Beaumont Martin, once wife of American-born tenor Riccardo Martin, who debuted as Faust in Boito's Mefistofele and continued at the Metropolitan Opera for nine seasons, sang also at La Scala, and shared with Allis composition lessons with Nadia Boulanger in Paris. I mourn never knowing the son they had together and lost together before the age of 10. I am blessed by knowing Allis' offspring from a later time in her life, when she was known as Allis Beaumont Reid, and settled in Vermont where Memorial Services will be held November 8th in Burlington, & November 12th in Lyndonville.
