Fiercely devoted to her daughters, Christina and Regina, Theresa also made her mark as the executive secretary to Barney Pressman and subsequently his son, Fred, of Barney's New York. For 27 years, nothing got done at Barney's without going through ''I. Terry''. She is survived by her brother, Anthony Biggi, her two daughters, and four beloved grandchildren: Jennifer, Christopher, Anthony and Alissa.
