He was an honors graduate of Harvard College, and had an MBA from Harvard University Business School, from which he graduated with highest honors, and was a George F. Baker Scholar. He was a member of the Spouting Rock Beach Association in Newport, RI, and the Harvard Club of New York. He was the son of the late Judge and Mrs. William C. Allen of Kentucky, and a descendant of a founder of the Society of the Cincinnati. Billy was known for his kind and generous spirit, his graciousness, his wit, and his courtly Southern charm. He was a man of many interests, including sailing, poetry, literature, history and politics, and a great animal lover devoted to his pets Katya and Winston. A true gentleman, he shall be much missed by all who knew him. A memorial service will be held at a later date. Memorial contributions may be made in his name to the Animal Medical Center of New York.
