        FAIRBERG-Maralyn Beth. Beloved daughter of the late Fred and Harriet Fairberg died February 25. A very special person, whose intelligence, sense of style, skill as a lawyer, love of cooking and entertaining, and support of the Avon Breast Cancer Walk will always be remembered. A wonderful person, loved by cousins and friends, her fellow ''walkers'', and her colleagues in the legal community, Maralyn will be sorely missed. Her great courage will be an inspiration going forward to all who knew her. A private graveside service will be held, and a Memorial will be held at a later date. Contributions in her memory may be made to The Avon Walk for Breast Cancer-NY, Avon Plaza, Rye, NY, 10580.
