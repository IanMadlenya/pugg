        GRAVES-Marilyn. We are deeply saddened by the passing of our dear friend Marilyn Graves. A woman of great spirit and dedication, Ms. Graves was a volunteer at The New York Hospital for 44 years & also served as Treasurer of the Auxiliary of The Society of the New York Hospital for many years. In recognition of her outstanding commitment, she was the first person nominated by the hospital to receive the United Hospital Fund's Auxiliarian of the Year Award. She was much loved and will be greatly missed. Our sincere sympathies are extended to her family and friends. David B. Skinner, M.D. Vice Chairman and CEO, New York Presbyterian Hospital.
