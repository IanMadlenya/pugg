Mr. Wiczyk emigrated to the United States after serving as both a Tank Commander and an Intelligence Officer for the Israeli Defense Forces during the Six Day War and revolutionized the concept of the American gasoline service business.

He also served as a board member of the National Marketing Advisory Committee of Amoco Oil.
