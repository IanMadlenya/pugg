        DUBROW-Margery B. Beloved wife of Daniel Mansolino, cherished daughter of Gus and Ann Dubrow, loved sister of Phyllis Klein, adored niece of Beatrice Friedman, Morris and Rose Schlecter, died peacefully at home on March 19, 2002, at the age of 59. She was a loving wife, deeply devoted to family and friends, especially her five grandnieces and nephews who brought her great joy. She was a wise, sensitive, compassionate and effective psychotherapist and teacher, engaged in private practice in NYC, and was a valued volunteer for GMHC. Despite being stricken with polio at the age of two, her ability to overcome her lifelong disability with tremendous courage and optimism, while battling cancer, was an inspiration for us all. May remembrance of her profound love and compassion bring comfort to all who mourn her passing. A remembrance service will be announced at a later date.
