        KAHN-Shirlee. The leadership and staff of UJA-Federation of New York are profoundly saddened by the passing of Shirlee Kahn, wife of William Kahn, former executive vice president of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, a predecessor of UJAFederation. Shirlee was an active partner, with her husband, in providing vision and leadership to the New York Jewish community for many years. Shirlee was a social worker with Westchester Jewish Community Services, a beneficiary of UJA-Federation, where she brought her special expertise in family therapy and marriage counseling. Mr. Kahn served as executive vice president of the Federation from 1981 to 1986. His leadership was crucial in planning and bringing about the merger, in 1986, of the Federation and the United Jewish Appeal of Greater New York. We extend deepest sympathies to Shirlee's husband, Bill, to their four children, 13 grandchildren, and to the entire family. Larry A. Silverstein, Board Chair Louise B. Greilsheimer, President Stephen D. Solender, Exec. V.P.
