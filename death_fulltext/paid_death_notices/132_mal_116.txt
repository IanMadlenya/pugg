        BURKE-William James. Bill passed away in his sleep on January 7 after a year long bout with cancer. Bill was born on August 30, 1927. After living most of his first 50 years in and around New York, he spent the last 20 years of his life living in Irving, Texas. Bill was a veteran of W.W. II and the Korean War and a graduate of Fordham Law School in NYC. His spirit and love of life were infectious, whether it was enjoying a good drink, having a smoke, or telling an offcolor joke at the most inopportune time, he always enjoyed himself and made sure those around him did the same. His sense of humor was undeniable. Bill was preceded in death by a brother, James Edmund Burke, and five sisters: Rose Browne, Marion McGrath, Jean Frances Burke, Ruth Burke and Eileen Burke. He is survived by his loving wife Eleanor, sons James and Peter, daughter-in-law Debbie, grandchildren Cody and Taelor, sister Jeanne Muller and Frances Todd and a great number of loving family members including his loving if not obedient dog Gonzo. There will be only one quite like Bill Burke. He will be deeply missed.
