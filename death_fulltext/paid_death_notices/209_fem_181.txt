        BERLIN--Doris. Beloved wife of the late Emanuel, devoted mother of Michael and Patty, adoring grandmother of Alexander, passed away on June 15, 2004 at the age of 82. Doris was a woman ahead of her time, who lived her life to the fullest. She loved and will forever be loved by her family in a way that is beyond words.
