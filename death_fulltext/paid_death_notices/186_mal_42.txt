        WILK-Elliott. The staff, the management and the Board of Directors of The Legal Aid Society mourn the loss of our beloved friend. As a Legal Aid Attorney in the Criminal Defense Division during the late 1960s and early 1970s, Elliott was a passionate advocate for his clients. Thereafter, he was a thoughtful and compassionate judge. He wrote landmark decisions on foster care and homelessness issues, always treating our clients with the respect and dignity they deserve. Elliott was a friend to many at the Society and he will be greatly missed. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to his wife Betty Levinson, a former Legal Aid Criminal Defense attorney, and to his sons, Daniel and David. Daniel L. Greenberg, President and Attorney-In-Chief
        WILK-Elliott. He was our dear friend, our companion in the struggle for quality, and the very epitome of a judge who gave us hope that justice is possible through the courts. We shall miss him. Dick Bellman, Lewis Steel, Susan Ritz, and Miriam Clark
