        CHASE-Rev. William. The entire family of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center mourns the passing of Reverend William J. Chase. He was a beloved and revered spiritual leader who founded Roosevelt Hospital's Chaplain Program and enlisted the support of local houses of worship in order to serve our diverse patient population. He ministered to their pastoral needs with wisdom and compassion and will be sorely missed. To his entire family, we offer our profound condolences. Lawrence S. Huntington Chairman of the Board Ronald C. Ablow, MD President Rev. Francis H. Geer Director, Religious Services
