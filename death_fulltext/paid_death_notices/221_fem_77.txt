        RICHARDSON--Dr. Mary Ann (nee Sanchirico). 67, a research scientist and professor of psychiatry at NYU, who devoted her career to improving the lives of those with schizophrenia, died on June 9, 2005 of breast cancer. Working until the time of her death as director of the Movement Disorders and Molecular Psychiatry Division of the Nathan Kline Institute, Dr. Richardson saw her life's work come to fruition in 2002 with the release of a medical treatment she created for Tardive Dyskinesia, a stigmatizing disorder afflicting some of the most severely ill psychiatric patients. Fiercely intelligent yet quietly patient and warm, she was a source of inspiration for many and of deep and loving comfort for the lucky few with whom she shared her life. She is survived by her husband, John J. Richardson DPM; son, Justin Richardson MD, and his partner, Peter Parnell; daughter, Martine Sacks MD, and granddaughter, Lita Sacks. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to a fund established in her memory to support patient care at Rockland Psychiatric Center and NKI. Contributions payable to the Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene may be sent to the Mary Ann Richardson Fund, c/o RFMH at NKI, 140 Old Orangeburg Road, Orangeburg, NY 10962. Viewing will be at Frank Campbell, 1076 Madison Ave, Friday & Saturday from 2-5 & 7-9 PM & Sunday from 9-11 AM. A memorial service is planned for the fall.
