        SANTALA-Timo. The principals, employees, and friends of Jacmel Jewelry and Soloro Manufacturing are deeply saddened by the loss of our friend Timo Santala. We were fortunate enough to have Timo join Jacmel as the Director of Manufacturing in June 1996. He brought many years of experience in manufacturing and metallurgy to the job, and was immediately respected and admired by his employees and peers. After several years at Jacmel, Timo agreed to take on a new challenge and was appointed President of Soloro Manufacturing, a Jacmel owned manufacturing facility in the Dominican Republic. Timo brought great enthusiasm and energy to Soloro, developing an extremely well run factory and an exceptional staff who will miss him deeply. We will miss our morning conference calls with him, the daily weather update, his quick wit, and being entertained by his stories about life in the Dominican Republic. His vast experience, knowledge and passion contributed mightily to the growth and communities of these two organizations. We know that we are joined by countless people whom Timo touched in his 20+ years in the jewelry industry. In mourning his passing we send our deepest sympathies to his wife Laura, his four children-Leo, Timo Jr., Annikki, Kaarina and the rest of his family & friends.
