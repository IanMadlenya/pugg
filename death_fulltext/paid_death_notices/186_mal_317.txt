        GESNER-Clark. The Princeton University Class of 1960 mourns the passing of one of its most talented members. As the creator of the show ''You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown'', Clark also contributed to 1960's major reunions, leaving his creative imprint on each gathering. His warm humor & engaging presence will be greatly missed by all his classmates. He was a good man, indeed.
