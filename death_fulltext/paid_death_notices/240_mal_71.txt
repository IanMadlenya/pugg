        $(6$)FRIEDMAN--Rodney M. We mourn with great sadness the passing of our courageous brilliant leader, Rodney Friedman. He was an inspiration for all of us fortunate to have worked with him for so many years. His passion for excellence in the dissemination of health care information to people worldwide was reflected in his role in the creation and founding of the University of California, Berkeley Wellness Letter and Johns Hopkins Health After 50 newsletter, for which he was the publisher and editorial director. We shall miss his eternal optimism, his love of life, and his grace of living life to the fullest. Our sincerest condolences to his dear Charlotte, Rafter, Alessandra and Jennesa. We are proud to have been a part of his life and his vision. The Staff of University Health Publishing/New York and Connecticut
