        BLOOM--Jennie, incomparable and adorable, died February 22, 2007 at the age of 89 in Naples, Florida. Born in New York City's Lower East Side, she raised her family in Brooklyn and Long Island where she was known for being an avid walker. Jennie and her husband Manny discovered and fell in love with Naples in 1977 for its gorgeous beaches. In recent years, Jennie could be found walking most days to the dock at Crayton Cove where she spent countless hours exchanging stories and offering her wisdom to any who sought it. Her remarkable spirit was an inspiration to all who had the good fortune to know her. Jennie was a lifelong believer in natural, holistic living. Jennie was predeceased by Manny and her daughter, Cookie. She is survived by her daughter and son-in-law, Diana and Victor Albano; granddaughters, Kim Albano, Jennifer Albano and her husband Matthew Dawson; niece and nephew, Carolyn Liebling and Jerry Seinfeld, and their families. Jennie will be greatly missed by all who knew her. A celebration of Jennie's life will take place Sunday, March 18th, 4:00 pm at the City Dock at Crayton Cove in Old Naples, Florida. In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation in her name to Habitat For Humanity, a cause close to Jennie's heart.
