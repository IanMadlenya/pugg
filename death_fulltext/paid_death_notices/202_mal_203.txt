        MACOMBER--William B., Jr. 82, died peacefully on November 19th in Nantucket of complications from Parkinsons. Loving husband, brother and uncle. Survived by his wife Phyllis and brother John. He served in WWII as a Marine officer in the OSS. Parachuted into France on two occasions to work with the French underground and later in Burma. He was a firm believer in public service, working in various congressional, AID and state department posts including Ambassador to Jordan, Turkey and as Under Secretary of State for Management. Upon leaving the State Department in 1977, he became President of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He retired to Nantucket and taught social studies at the high school and helped coach their football team, the latter being one of his great joys. Contributions can be made in his memory to The Macomber Family Scholarship at Phillips Academy, Andover, MA or the Nantucket Atheneum, PO Box 808, Nantucket, MA 02554
        MACOMBER--William B., Jr. The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art deeply mourn the passing of William Macomber, who served devotedly as President for eight years, from 1978 to 1986. He applied his exemplary experience of more than 20 years in the diplomatic corps--as ambassador to Jordan and to Turkey, among other posts--to skilled leadership of the Metropolitan Museum at a time when it was undergoing a period of great activity and growth. To his wife Phyllis, we extend our heartfelt condolences. James R. Houghton, Chairman Philippe de Montebello, Director David E. McKinney, President
