        SINDEBAND-Seymour Jay. The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science of Columbia University expresses its sorrow at the loss of its counselor, benefactor, and friend, Seymour Jay Sindeband. After receiving his A.B., B.S., and M.S. degrees from Columbia, and serving as a Naval officer during World War II, Mr. Sindeband pioneered computer applications that included systems for airlines, banks, railroads, and the American Stock Exchange. At Columbia he served on the Advisory Council of the Engineering School, and in a rare honor, received both the John Jay Award and, like his father, the Egleston Medal. The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science extends deepest sympathy to the Sindeband family.
