        WHITE - Alexander Moss. Died Nov. 5, 2002 at his home, Pachelbel Farm in Old Chatham, NY surrounded by loving family. He will always be cherished by his wife Amy, children Alison Pena, Tim White, Chris White, Annie Plumer, Elsie White and three grandsons. His son Alec died in 1985. Born 1933 in Glen Cove, NY, Mr. White graduated in 1955 from Harvard College and from Harvard Business School, 1959. He was partner at White Weld & Co., Managing Director at Merrill Lynch and Sr. investment banker at James D. Wolfensohn & Co. Upon retirement in 1989 he moved to Old Chatham where he created a beautiful farm, learning to grow and cut great quality hay. Continuing to work as a financial consultant, for the past decade he was on the board of AMVESCAP. Devoted to the betterment of education, for 26 years he was a trustee and head of the finance committee of the Cooper Union. On the board of Nightingale Bamford School, from 1970 to 1979 and its president for four years, he was also treasurer of the Collegiate School, 1981-85. In Chatham, he was elected to the Public School's board in 1996 and served as President from 1999-2001. Thereafter he headed the Chatham Education Foundation, seeking to enhance arts and humanities in the Chatham schools. A man of clear-sighted action rather than words, he pursued with tireless and quiet passion what he most loved-family and friends, the natural world, sport and music, and devotion to his financial and educational work. While a gentle person he was possessed of a steely sense of integrity, rationality and responsibility. Services will be held this Sunday at St. Peter's Church in Spencertown, NY at 3:30PM. Donations may be sent to the Chatham Education Foundation, c/o Chatham Central School District, Chatham, NY 12037.
