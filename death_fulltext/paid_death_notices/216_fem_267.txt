        BLAU--Maxine. Resident of South Orange, New Jersey, passed away at her home on January 24 with her loving sister, family, and devoted friend by her side. Maxine was born on July 8, 1940 to the late Hope & Raymond Blau. A graduate of the University of Chicago, Maxine worked as a mainframe consultant for Honeywell and several other large corporations. Later she joined the family business Max Blau & Sons, Inc., and eventually became a principal in the company. Maxine enjoyed work, travel, cars, art and music. Her adventurous spirit knew no bounds. Her orchid and photography collection reflected her love of nature. She took time to enjoy all of life's beauty. She is survived by her devoted sister Adele, nephews David and Greg Cass, and beloved friend of 27 years Murray Levine. Maxine showed limitless strength in her battle with cancer. She lived significantly longer than everyone expected, and was a fighter until the end. Through her personal strength and positive attitude along with the support of Adele and Murray, and the dedication of doctors Daniel Roses, James Speyer, Silvia Formenti, and John Golfinos of NYU she lived with dignity and a high quality of life. Thank you all. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the NYU Clinical Cancer Center, c/o Dr. James Speyer, 160 East 34 St, 8th fl, NY, NY 10016. Family and friends will be received at her home, 218 North Woods Dr., South Orange, New Jersey, on Wednesday and Thursday January 26 and 27 from 2PM to 5PM and 7PM to 9PM.
