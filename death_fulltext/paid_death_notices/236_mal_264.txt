        TULL--Patrick. We mourn the loss of our dear fellow Player, member of our Board of Directors, wonderful actor and great friend. His contributions to our club were significant and his fellowship was fun and memorable. He will be sorely missed. Our love and thoughts are with Sue, Kate and Siobhan and their family.
