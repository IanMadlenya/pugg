        LEONTIEF--Estelle Marks, 97, died Tuesday, 28 June, 2005 from an unexpected and severe infection. Much loved wife of the late Wassily Leontief, mother of Svetlana Alpers, grandmother of Benjamin and Nicholas and also to their wives Karin and Kathryn, great-grandmother of Noah, Mira, Alina and Isaac, loving sister to the late Dorothy Wigderson. Author, reader, devoted to her piano, deeply engaged friend to so many. It is hard to believe that such a vigorous human presence is gone. She will be greatly missed.
