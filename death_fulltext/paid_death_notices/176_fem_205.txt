        SOSEWITZ-Shelley. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) are deeply saddened by the loss of their dear friend Shelley Sosewitz of Chicago, beloved wife for 48 years of past president, chairman of the board and giant in our organization Ben Z. Sosewitz. A Zionist since youth, Mrs. Sosewitz actively shared her husband's fervent devotion to the ATS, the Technion and Israel. As Technion Guardians the couple committed themselves to building the Technion and the nation through their endowment of the Ben and Shelley Sosewitz Academic Lectureship, funding of the Ben and Shelley Sosewitz Dormitory, and support of all Chicago Chapter projects, such as the Crown Superconductivity Center and the Asher Space Research Institute. Their most recent innovation, the Sosewitz/Jackier Institute for Leadership Development, prepares young leaders for national roles in the organization. Mrs. Sosewitz, a familiar face on many ATS missions abroad and at national board meetings, shared Ben's broad vision, provided quiet inspiration and thoughtful insights. As an accomplished classical pianist she also inspired her students and audiences with her passionate love of music. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Ben Sosewitz, daughters Miriam Clarke, Leah Sosewitz and Arna Yastrow, their seven grandchildren and the entire Sosewitz family.
