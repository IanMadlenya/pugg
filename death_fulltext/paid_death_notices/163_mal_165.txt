        WIRTH-Morris A. The Partners, Counsel, Associates and Staff of Baer Marks & Upham LLP mourn the loss of our partner and friend after a brief battle against the ravages of cancer. Morris had a distinguished fifty-year career in the practice of law and was most readily identified with over thirtyfive years of legal representation of the State of Israel. Morris was a marvelous person, a student of the law, a teacher of the law to young colleagues at our office and a trusted friend and confidant. We extend our sincere condolences to his wife, Jean, his sons, Bobby, Billy and John, his daughters-in-law, Kelly and Lisa, Vasilia Hughes, and the apple of his eye, his grandson, Alec. We will miss him dearly.
        WIRTH-Morris A. For almost forty years, we have shared most things together, the good and the not so good. I will miss our daily contacts and your wonderful, but sometimes too long, stories. Most of all, I will miss you, my good friend and long-time partner. Our hearts go out to Jean, Bobby, Billy and John, Kelly, Lisa and Vasilia, and the apple of your eye, Alec, and to all those who will miss you, as we do. Suzanne and Don Bezahler
