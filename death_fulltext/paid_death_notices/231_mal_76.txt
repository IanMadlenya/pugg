        BEGLEITER - Henri. The SUNY Downstate Medical Center community mourns the passing of Henri Begleiter, PhD, Distinguished Professor of Psychiatry and Director of the Neurodynamics Laboratory at SUNY Downstate. Highlights of Dr. Begleiter's extraordinary career include being the first to characterize brain dysfunction in alcoholics; assembling an internationally renowned project that successfully identified several genes involved in the predisposition toward alcoholism and related disorders; inception of the federally-funded, multi-center Collaborative Study of the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA); and the introduction of the use of endophenotypes, or biological markers, to study the genetics of complex disorders in patients and their offspring. Our deepest sympathies are extended to his wife, Esther; his son, David; his daughter, Alison; his sonin-law Noah Siegel; his grandchildren; and to his numerous friends and colleagues throughout the world.
