His long and brilliant career included work with the New York and San Francisco Planning Departments, a stint with the OSS, and directing the new UN Center for Regional Development in Nagoya, Japan. He taught at numerous universities in the US and outside of it, and was a published author. He is survived by his wife, Margaret Pelton (''Peg'') Duggar, 1200 Mira Mar #
