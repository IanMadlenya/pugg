        LORY--Jonathan Michael. Born December 19, 1948, died on June 5, 2006. Loving son and grandson of the late Jack and Winifred Lory, Agnes Henry Feeley, and Isaac and Allegra Levy. He is survived by his beloved wife Carla, uncles Gerard Feeley and Edward Lory, and an extended family of devoted aunts, cousins, and longstanding friends. Many of those friends met Jonathan during his 30-year career as an audio engineer at the American Broadcasting Company, which earned him eight Emmy Awards. He worked on daytime dramas, national conventions and presidential debates, covered town meetings in Israel and South Africa, traveled to Sarajevo and Lake Placid for Olympics, and to stadiums across the country for Monday night Baseball and Football. He leaves us who knew him best with memories to cherish of a warm and gentle man with a keen respect for detail and workmanship, an encyclopedic memory, vast interests, tremendous style, extraordinary humor and quick wit, all of which he shared with remarkable generosity and kindness. He was a joy in our lives and he will be deeply missed.
