        WALKER--Tommy Ray. Beloved husband of Eunice Salton. Father of Dallas Walker Pender. Father-in-law of John Pender IV and grandfather of Ellen Van Horn Pender. Died in Costa Rica on November 21, 2003, victim of a tragic drowning accident. Born on November 28, 1941, to Euphie and Frank Walker, he was proud to be a 5th generation Texan and native of Ft. Worth. He was a graduate of the University of Texas and a U.S. Army veteran. Professionally, he enjoyed much success as an innovative and enthusiastic advocate for futures and options markets. He served as a Vice President for Dean Witter, General Manager of Clayton Brokerage and Vice President of Marketing for two major commodities exchanges (COMEX and NYBOT), as well as a teacher and a term as a small town mayor in Texas. On a personal level, his life and work touched many people. Tom's talent and creative energy joined with his endless store of generosity, warmth, and kindness could lighten the heaviest heart and illuminate the darkest of days. He loved his family, his friends and his work without qualification. And those who had the good fortune to share his days loved him dearly in return. His loss is great; his life--a treasure. A memorial service will be held at 10 AM, Wednesday, December 3, 2003, at Trinity Church located at Broadway and Wall Street in New York City. Donations can be sent in lieu of flowers to the Tommy Walker Memorial Fund at ''Plays for Living'' (a non-profit organization that benefits at-risk youth through the arts) at 505 Eighth Ave., Suite 1202, NY, NY 10018.
