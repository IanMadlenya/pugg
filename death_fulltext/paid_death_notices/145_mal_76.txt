        LARSEN-C. Peter. Died peacefully at home on February 4, 1999, too soon, at age 62. He was the beloved husband and soulmate of Anne and the proud and loving father of sons Mark of White Plains and Paul, with wife Susan, of Florence, SC. He was devoted to his step-children and their families: Alex, Dana, Nicholas, Samuel, and Maximilian Shuhan; Andrea, David, Jacob and Benjamin Gelber; and Chrysantha and Charles Willis. He is also survived by his aunt Gertrude Maslow and several cousins. He was the son of the late Theodore Marinus and Beatrice Silverstein Larsen. Contributions in his memory to the American Lung Association or the NYU Medical Center would be appreciated. A memorial service will be held at a later date to remember him with words and music.
