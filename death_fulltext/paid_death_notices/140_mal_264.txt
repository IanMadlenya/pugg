        TURKEL-Gary, 58. Longtime resident of Chatham Towers in Lower Manhattan, passed away on Saturday morning, September 19. He leaves his wife Toby, son Avi, twin brother Michael, and sister Barbara, three nieces and four nephews in Israel, and three nieces and two nephews locally. For 26 years, he worked as a butcher at Turkel Kosher Meats at Essex Street Market alongside his father, Frank. After closing the store, he worked with his brother at Sobel Construction. A Boy Scout in his youth, he attended Ten-Mile Scout Camp. Later, he was a Civil War buff and Pavarotti fan, an expert sport and fly fisherman, and a gourmet cook. An unfailingly supportive husband and father, he helped his wife attain her goals, and he was very proud of his son's achievements. He contributed his talents and energy unstintingly and with great dedication at Civic Center Synagogue for many years. A generous, soulful, and selfless individual, he helped friends and strangers alike. If desired, contributions in his memory can be made to ''Gary's Kitchen Fund'' at Civic Center Synagogue, 49 White St., NYC 10013.
        TURKEL-Gary. Civic Center Synagogue deeply mourns the passing of Gary Turkel, husband and helpmate of past President and dear member Toby Turkel and father of Avi. Gary's kind presence, ready assistance, and devotion to Judaism will be profoundly missed. A wonderful and generous man, he made many events possible and could often be found handing out plates from the Synagogue kitchen. We shall remember him with affection and gratitude, and extend our heartfelt sympathy to his wife and son. Rabbi Jonathan Glass Robert Sidi, Esq., President
