        SCHMIDERER -- Timothy Franz, 65, died October 22, after a sudden illness. We are deeply saddened at the passing of this consummate architect and extraordinary human being. Our heart goes out to his loving wife Nancy; his children Emily Schmiderer Ford and Anthony Schmiderer; grandchildren Jason, Brianna, Corinne and Taylor and his sister Dorothy Schmiderer Baker. Tim's father was the architect Simon Schmiderer. Tim was the grandson of Dorothy Tiffany Burlingham and the great grandson of Charles Culp Burlingham and Louis Comfort Tiffany. Tim was a vital member of our firm, a mentor to our younger staff, and a caring gentle man. He made a lasting contribution to the architecture of New York City including numerous residential projects; the Council on Foreign Relations; Lerner Hall Student Center and Lenfest Hall at Columbia University; the new Stuyvesant High School; Kingsborough Community College; Long Dock Beacon and the Cooper Union. We will sorely miss him. Contributions in Tim's memory can be made to the Scenic Hudson Land Trust and Goddard Riverside Community Center. The Partners & Staff of Gruzen Samton, Architects
