        BARBARIS--Harry T., M.D. The administration, trustees, and staff of St. Francis Hospital, The Heart Center in Roslyn, New York, mourn the passing of Harry T. Barbaris, M.D., distinguished physician leader and beloved friend. Dr. Barbaris was a part of the institutional fabric of St. Francis, having joined the Hospital in 1975. At the time of his passing, he was the Hospital's Director of Surgery. Dr. Barbaris attained his undergraduate degree in 1965 from Georgetown University. He attended Georgetown Medical College, from which he graduated in 1969. He completed his Surgical Residency at North Shore University Hospital/Cornell Medical Center in 1971 and completed his Urology Residency Training at Georgetown University Hospital in 1975. Dr. Barbaris was appointed to St. Francis Hospital's professional staff in October 1975 and appointed Chief of Urology in January 1985. He served as President of the Medical Staff for the years 1990 and 1991. In December 1994, he was appointed Director of Surgery. Throughout his entire tenure at St. Francis Hospital, irrespective of the position he held, Dr. Barbaris always demonstrated a boundless love of, and commitment to, St. Francis Hospital, its patients and employees. As Director he participated in the recruitment of over 100 surgeons for the Department of Surgery, and the initiation of new programs and modalities, such as the da Vinci robotic surgical program and radio frequency ablation, as well as the expansion of the Hospitals laparoscopic surgical capabilities. His leadership, generosity of spirit and good humor will be sorely missed by the entire St. Francis Hospital community.
