        ROSENTHAL-Eva. On December 15, 1999 of cancer. Eva was born in York, England and spent her early years in Manchester, England. She was educated at Lowther College in Wales, in France, and at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London. During World War II, she served in the Royal Air Force as a commissioned officer specializing in cryptography. Eva emigrated to the United States in 1953 and married Sumner Rosenthal in 1958. Among her survivors are her husband, her cousin Richard Benson, niece Merry Newman and nephew Jim Siegel of New York; sister-in-law Bernice Newman of San Diego; and cousins Esme Raye and Vivian Rabin of London. Her family and friends in the United States and England will never forget Eva's insight and wit nor the grit with which she fought her final illness. They recall her elegance dressed either in cashmere and pearls or in blue jeans, her fondness for Jack Russells long before the breed became trendy, her love and her loyalty. Funeral services will be held on Sunday, December 19 at noon at Park West Riverside, Amsterdam Ave. and 76th Street in Manhattan. Contributions in her memory may be made to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Ave., Attn: Box E, NY, NY 10021
