        HERSKOVITS--Shimon. The Board of Trustees, Administration, Faculty, and the entire Parent body of the Magen David Yeshivah Isaac Shalom Elementary School and Celia Esses High School, join our students in mourning the loss and untimely passing of our deeply loved and highly respected Rabbi and Principal. A man whom we regarded as our mentor, respected as a father and considered a friend. His caring and compassion made ''our'' children ''his'' children. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife Susan, his children, Ephraim, Schmuel, Yitzchak and Leah, and the entire extended Herskovits family. Eddie J. Esses, President
