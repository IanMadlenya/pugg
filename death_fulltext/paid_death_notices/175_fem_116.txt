        SELBY-Christine ''Kiki'' (Van Erk). Passed away on August 14. She was so many things: a mother, a wife, a sister and a friend. More often than not, a combination of them all. Those who were fortunate enough to have known her will miss her kindness, wit, humor, sense of adventure, fight & never ending optimism. No one could hope for a better legacy. She is survived by her husband Tom, daughter Katie, sisters Nina and Sally & brothers Ted and Garrett. Visitation at McGrath Funeral Home, 20 Cedar Street, Bronxville, NY, Thursday, August 16, 2-4PM & 7-9PM. A Funeral Mass at Saint Peter and Paul in Mount Vernon, East Birch St, on Friday, August 17 at 10 A.M. Contributions in her memory may be made to MSKCC, 1275 York Avenue, POB 315, NY, New York 10021. Designate Dr. Moynahan's Research Fund.
