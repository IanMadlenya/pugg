We extend our heartfelt condolences as well to children, Fred Gordon and Dr. Charles (and Susan) Gordon; grandchildren; and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University David S. Gottesman, Chairman YU Board of Trustees Mordecai D.
