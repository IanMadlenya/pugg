        BARBEE-John M., Ph.D. On January 2, 1999. Born Claruge Gayle in Raleigh, N.C. Barbee was preacher, teacher, philosopher and raconteur. As a child prodigy tentpreacher, he barnstormed 22 states, logged 5,000 miles and evangelized one million listeners by age 21. A voracious reader with a keen mind, Barbee earned advanced degrees from Duke University, University of Chicago and Marquette University. At NationalLouis University, Professor Barbee engaged the uninitiated with a sweet-as-honey, Carolinian drawl and his cornball humor. He charmed, challenged, and seduced unwitting or fallow minds to reason. Dr. Barbee used verve, zest and zeal as his weapons of choice in his indefatigable cultivation of critical, rational intellects. He said, ''The possibility of serving students toward their personal fulfillment in rich human living is as thrilling a prospect as I could imagine.''
