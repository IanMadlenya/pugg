        LEONTIEF-Wassily. The New York University community mourns the death of Wassily Leontief, a Nobel Laureate, a long-time professor of economics and director of NYU's Institute of Economic Analysis. He was a scholar of extraordinary distinction, richly deserving of the high honors he was accorded. He was also a colleague with a delightful temperament, and a teacher with a passion for expanding human knowledge and conveying it to students. His contributions to the understanding of how economies work will remain a crucial advance in his field. His energetic presence added much to the life of the University, and he will be sorely missed. L. Jay Oliva, President Martin Lipton, Chairman, Board of Trustees
