        SHAPIRO-Alexander. We extend our Kos Tanchumim to Barbara Joseph, member of the National Women's Division Board, on the lose of her beloved father. Together with her husband Manfred, the Josephs are Silver Founders of the Medical Center. Through their longtime support they have shown an extraordinary commitment to helping the mission of the ''Hospital With a Heart'' to heal the sick and ease the pain of the people of Jerusalem and Israel. This outstanding example of tzedekah and chesed, as demonstated by their devotion to Torat Yisrael, Am Yisrael and Eretz Yisrael, emulates the example set by Barbara's father. May the family have loving memories of this wonderful and caring man, and may be they be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
