        PARSA--Mohamad, M.D. The faculty, staff and students of Columbia University Medical Center mourn the loss of our esteemed colleague and friend, Dr. Mohamad Parsa. Dr. Parsa joined the Columbia community in 1969, completing his residency and clinical fellowship at Harlem Hospital Center between 1969 and 1973. He returned to Harlem Hospital in 1980 as attending surgeon and director of The Trauma Center. He was named an associate professor of clinical surgery at Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons in 1985 and was promoted to clinical professor of surgery in 1999. Dr. Parsa was a pioneer and renowned expert in hyperalimentation, or supplying nutrients intravenously to patients who cannot ingest food. He published the first book on the subject in this country in 1974 and played a significant role in the recovery of many surgical patients at Harlem Hospital Center. Dr. Parsa was a dedicated teacher, clinician and researcher. We extend our deepest sympathies to his family and friends. He will be greatly missed. Gerald D. Fischbach, M.D., Executive Vice President for Health and Biomedical Sciences and Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, Columbia University
