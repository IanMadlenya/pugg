        PECKETT-Jack. New York University grieves for the loss of Jack Peckett, the Associate Director of Athletics and a member of the NYU community for nearly three decades. A cherished friend, a valued colleague, and an unflagging booster of NYU, Jack was a principal architect of NYU's sports and recreations programs. We shall miss him greatly. Our thoughts are with his loved ones, and we share their sorrow. Christopher Bledsoe, Director, NYU Athletics
