        FLUG-Fortunee nee Husney. Mother, you brought me into this world and gave me the warmest welcome a son could have been given. You were by my side for the good times and the bad times. Nothing was ever too much for you. I watched you struggle for quite a few years. Finally it was just too difficult. You were there for my first breath of life, I was there for your last. I watched you go to Heaven. I will think of you and speak of you every day. The love you have given me will never die. You are the beat in my heart. Robert
