        SILVERMAN--Sol. Died August 16, 2005 in West Palm Beach, FL. Longtime labor leader and political activist with AFSCME and the United Furniture Workers Union in New York and in Florida for many years after retirement. An inspirational orator, a truly funny man, a gifted storyteller, he remained a strong and principled advocate for working people until the day he died. He leaves behind to carry on his legacy his wife Jill, son and daughter-in-law Bill and Bonita, grandson Will, in-laws, nieces and nephews, and many, many friends. We all miss him terribly. He was one of the last of the just.
