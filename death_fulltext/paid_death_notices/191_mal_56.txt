        SPIEGEL-Daniel. The directors, officers and employees of KSW Mechanical Services mourn the passing of our director and good friend, Dan Spiegel. Our relationship, over a 25-year period, has always been a source of inspiration to us. He will be sorely missed both professionally and personally by all who worked with him.
