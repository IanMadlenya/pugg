        GOODMAN--Barbara Cradin. I lost my gentle, beautiful, loving wife on Sunday. Barbara was always the sweet, innocent girl that I first met 64 years ago. Her character was defined by a generosity of spirit and the ardor of her love for everyone she knew. She leaves our daughter Laura, son James, grandson Daniel, son-in-law Elliot Richman, and niece Judith Lieberman. While we will miss her very much, we will be consoled by our memories of this remarkable woman. When we've had time to accept this terrible loss, we will gather in private to reminisce and celebrate her life. Bernard Goodman
