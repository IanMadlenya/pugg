        WASSERMAN-Mel, 72, died peacefully in his sleep at his home in Carmel, CA on Monday April 29, 2002. As co-founder of CEDU Education with his wife Brigitte, Mel has touched the lives of thousands of families. CEDU was founded in 1967, when they welcomed troubled children into their home. Since then, it has grown into a world-renowned program with six schools working so successfully with troubled children and their families. Mel's lifework lives on through his teachings, philosophy, and within the countless thousands whom he has touched so deeply. Mel made a difference in such a real way. He gave of himself freely, and always brought value to other people's lives. He was truly larger than his own life. Mel is survived by his wife Brigitte, his brother Al, and his three children, Mark, Dana, and Stacy. Mel was blessed with eight beautiful grandchildren, Jessica, Alexandra, Kristina, Kendall, John, James, Spencer, and Logan. Mel's extended family includes all those whom he touched, and welcomed into his home. We love him dearly and he will always be in our hearts. In keeping with Mr. Wasserman's wishes, there will be no service. The family suggests that memorial contributions be sent to the Boys & Girls Club of the Monterey Peninsula, 1332 La Salle Ave, Seaside, CA 93955.
