        de KOONING-Willem. The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art join the art community in mourning the loss of Willem de Kooning. Above all, however, we wish to honor his life. A great painter, he used that life to the full and contributed immeasurably to the medium he personified for over half of this century. ''Space,'' he said, ''is given to the artist to change if he can.'' No one of his era changed the space of modern painting more, or left a richer creative legacy. Ronald S. Lauder, Chairman, Agnes Gund, President, Glenn D. Lowry, Director, The Museum of Modern Art, NY
