        SNOW-Vernon F. New York University notes with sadness the passing of Dr. Vernon F. Snow, educator, friend and benefactor of New York University. Through the John Ben Snow Memorial Trust, Dr. Snow assisted many artistic and educational endeavors. At NYU, he is remembered for his longtime support of the Root-Tilden-Snow Scholarship Fund at the School of Law and the John Ben Snow Scholarship Fund at the Stern School. We shall miss him greatly.
