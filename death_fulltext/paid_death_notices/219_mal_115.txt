        IAKOVOS--Archbishop. The Executive Commitee, Board of Trustees and members of the Archbishop Iakovos Leadership 100 Endowment Fund Incorporated express their deep sorrow at the passing of Leadership 100's founder on April 10, 2005, and exclaim profound appreciation for his extraordinary ministry and service. Archbishop Iakovos founded the Archbishop Iakovos Leadership 100 Endowment Fund in 1984 as an act of love and commitment to forward the mission of the Greek Orthodox Church in America. Today it has grown to 700 members and has given more than $18 million in grants for the National Ministries of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America. Archbishop Iakovos, who served for 37 years as the Archbishop of North and South America, retired in 1996, but remained an inspiration to Orthodox faithful and to Leadership 100. A towering religious figure over so many critical decades in the history of our Church and our nation, he was known worldwide for his dedication to human and civil rights, religious freedom and to ecumenical dialogue and interfaith relations. May his memory be eternal!
