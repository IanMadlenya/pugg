        HEUMAN-Kenny. Now the world can know Superman wasn't Clark Kent, it was Kenny Heuman. He showed us the meaning of true strength, the beauty of the mountains, the poetry of snow. He leaves behind a legacy of friendship and memories, & his loving wife Karen, his Lois Lane. She matched him strength for strength through unbearable adversity. To his children, Randi, Harvey and Cheryl & his granddaughter Alexis for whom he willed himself to stay alive until she was born. Know that his memory is for a blessing. Kal, Peggy, Brynn, Josh & Danny Dolgin
        HEUMAN-Kenny. 4 friends & a weekend in Vail grew to over 100 strong, all following his tracks. He never waited, never looked back, though he taught us to love the mountains & each other. Ketski Ski Club
