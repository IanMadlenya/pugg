        REID-Irving W., D.D.S. We mourn the loss of our dear friend, fellow Player and member of our Board of Directors. An accomplished dentist, he was also a man of great culture and a stalwart advocate for music and the arts. Evenings with him in The Grill were glorious events. We will miss him greatly. Our sympathies to his family. A memorial service will be held Friday December 8th. 1pm at Calvary Church, 21 St. & Park Ave. The Players
