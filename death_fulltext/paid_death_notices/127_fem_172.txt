        LYDON-Sally, on August 28, 1997. Beloved sister of James, Edward, Michael, Mary and Annarose. Devoted daughter of the late Patrick and Sarah. Funeral Mass Saturday at St. Cecilia R.C. Church, Brooklyn at 9:30 AM. Interment in Calvary Cemetery. She gave her time and boundless energy as a long time volunteer at St. Patrick's Cathedral. She was an active member of the Catholic Daughters of America and other humanitarian groups which she joined after a long career with the U.S. Army Recruiting Service. She will be much missed by everyone and most especially by her many nieces and nephews who grew up under her warm concern and generosity and to whom she was known as Great Aunt Sally. Family requests private wake.
