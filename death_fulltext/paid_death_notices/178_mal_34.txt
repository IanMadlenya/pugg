        ENGLISHER-Elihu B. The Board of Directors, staff and members of the YM/YWHA of Washington Heights and Inwood deeply mourn the passing of Elihu B. Englisher, husband of the late Dorothy Englisher, father of Larry and Martin G. Englisher, the agency's Executive Vice President. Mr. Englisher was an early & very loyal supporter of the agency. Beginning with his sons' registration in nursery school he assisted with fundraising efforts, especially with bazaars. A merchant in Washington Heights for many years, he was well known to neighbors & customers alike. He shared his skill, warmth and humor with all around him. Our deepest condolences to his family. Services Sunday, November 4, at 11:00 A.M., Plaza Jewish Community Chapel, 630 Amsterdam Avenue, New York City. Deborah Katznelson, Sr. Associate Exec. Director Dr. Ruth Westheimer, President
