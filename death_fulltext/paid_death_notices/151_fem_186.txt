        COHEN-Jessie L. Died August 16, 1999, from complications of a stroke. A graduate of Cornell University, she was one of the founders of Trewhella, Cohen and Arbuckle (T/C/A) and was its president for 25 years. She was an early pioneer in adapting the power of the computer to the processing of market research data and her brilliant mind and skilled perseverance led to the successful completion of many large scale major data processing projects. Those of us who were fortunate enough to be a close part of her life knew that her kindness and generosity matched her intellectual capabilities. She will be missed.
