        KAPLAN--Milton I., M.D., On December 25, 2004, at the age of 93. Adored father of Lois Nelson, Bruce (Madeline) Kaplan, and Rachelle (Adin) Goldberg. Cherished grandfather of Stephanie Nelson (Michael) Robin and Richard (Wendy) Nelson; Lauren, Brian, and Mark Kaplan; and Robin, Jodie, and Joshua Goldberg. Proud great-grandfather of Coby Terry and Skylar Rose Robin, and Jack Dylan Nelson. Devoted brother of Violette Gross, and brother-in-law of Eve Glazer. Past President of the Kings County Surgical Society. For over 60 years, a caring, dedicated and esteemed family physician and general and orthopedic surgeon in Brooklyn, NY. He was generous to individuals as well as countless charities. The patriarch of our family, we will deeply miss his loving presence, his guidance, storytelling and sense of humor. Our sadness is lessened only by the knowledge that he is now reunited with the love of his life, Terry, his wife of 51 years & our beloved mother, who left us 14 years ago.
