        GOTTLIEB-Paul. Japan Society mourns the passing of Paul Gottlieb, a great friend and mentor who initiated our co-publishing venture of exhibition catalogs on Japanese and East Asian art with Harry N. Abrams, Inc. His efforts did much to bring Asian art into the mainstream of art book publishing, and we appreciate his bold vision to support the expanding field of modern Japanese art as well. We shall miss his passion for art and for life. William Clark, Jr., President Alexandra Munroe, Director Japan Society Gallery
