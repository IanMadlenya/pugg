        EVANS-Emanuel J. The Covenant Foundation mourns the passing of Emanuel Evans, beloved father of our esteemed Board Chairman, Eli N. Evans. Emanuel Evans served as Mayor of Durham, NC from 1951-63. A near lengendary figure, he was known throughout the South for his success in bringing desegregation to Durham's schools, public accommodations, the police and fire departments and city agencies. He and his late wife, Sara, were active in the leadership of the United Jewish Appeal and Israel Bonds, they also worked to create and support the Center for Judaic Studies at Duke University. May you be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Susan Crown, President Dr. Judith Ginsberg, Exec Director The Covenant Foundation
