        SKINNER-David B., M.D. The Department of Surgery at Weill Medical College of Cornell University mourns the passing of Dr. David B. Skinner, President Emeritus of NewYork - Presbyterian Hospital and Professor of Surgery at Weill Cornell Medical College. Dr. Skinner's contributions to surgery of the esophagus were legendary, and he was beloved by his many patients for the care he provided them. His vision and management led to the building of the Greenberg Pavilion and the merger of the New York Hospital with the Presbyterian Hospital to form NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. He was always an outstanding leader and advocate for our Department of Surgery and will be sorely missed. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Ellie, and his family.
