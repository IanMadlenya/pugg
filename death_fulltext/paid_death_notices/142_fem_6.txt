        KOREIN-Sarah. The Boys Town Jersualem family mourns the passing of Mrs. Sarah Korein, a respected philanthropist committed to the ideals of her sacred Jewish heritage. She accompanied her grandfather when he left Dresden to live a life of sanctity in Jerusalem. Though she left Israel 70 years ago to come to these shores, she remained imbued with the aspirations that the people of Israel would ultimately subscribe to the Torah ideals of her greatgranduncle, the sainted Rabbi Benzion Yadler. Mrs. Korein established a major scholarship endowment at Boys Town, providing disadvantaged Israeli youth with a Torah/Technology education. The achievements of Boys Town's 5000 graduates, role models of Torah im Derech Eretz, will serve as a living memorial to Mrs. Korein. Her good deeds will endure as an everlasting blessing. May her family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Josh S. Weston, Chairman Michael J. Scharf, President Rabbi Moshe Linchner, Dean Rabbi Ronald L. Gray, Exec VP
