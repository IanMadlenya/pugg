        THOMAS--Martha J. SUNY Downstate Medical Center mourns the sudden passing of Martha J. Thomas, former Assistant Vice President for Community and Governmental Relations. Ms. Thomas's contributions to SUNY Downstate and to Brooklyn were legion. Her colleagues and her countless friends will miss her greatly. We extend our deepest sympathies to her daughter, Dr. Cherryl Thomas, her son, Eric Thomas, and his wife, to her two granddaughters, to her companion, Ron Green, and to all other members of her family. John C. LaRosa, MD, President
