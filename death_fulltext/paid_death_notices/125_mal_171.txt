        FLODA-Liviu. August 16, 1913 June 3, 1997. This Romanian native left his homeland in 1963 and began a career with Radio Free Europe in 1964. His creative, engaging journalism included interviews with Eugene Ionesco, Nobel laureate George Palade, Jean Negulesco, Isamu Noguchi, Andrei Codrescu, Andrei Serban, Radu Lupu, Viorica Cortez, and many others. He provided a welcome support to many Romanian refugees and exiles, especially in their broadcast appeals for family reunification. When the New York office of RFE/RL closed in 1993, the Voice of America recruited him. He left to assemble his archives for the Hoover Institution of War, Revolution, and Peace. This extraordinary collection of tapes, scripts, personal letters, and photos provides a unique portrait of the experience of Romanians in America. To his wife Martha and children Sylvia and Eugen, friends extend their deepest sympathies.
        FLODA-Liviu. My friend, your journalism explored the new and refreshed the known, always in the spirit of appreciation. Your generous kindness to everyone is an example to follow. You'll always be with me. Love, Sara
