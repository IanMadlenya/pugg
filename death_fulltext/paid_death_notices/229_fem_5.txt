        BROWN--Nan Bimblick. Born January 10, 1931 in Cincinnati, passed away on January 31 just three weeks after her 75th birthday. Nan was beautiful and strong and the best mother her sons Warren and Gary, and daughter, Anabelle, could have had. An accomplished fashion designer, businesswoman and caregiver to her husbands Robert Bimblick and Marvin Brown, she was a powerful and loving force for everyone she knew. The family asks that tributes be made to Leesburg Regional Medical Center Foundation, 701 W. Palmetto St., Leesburg, FL, 34748, or to any local Hospice.
