        ALBERT-Sheridan. The New York State Trial Lawyers Association notes with deep sorrow the passing of a leader of the New York bar, Sheridan Albert. We thank him for his valued service to NYSTLA, as an active member, as President (1978-80) and as dean. NYSTLA extends its sympathies to his family.
