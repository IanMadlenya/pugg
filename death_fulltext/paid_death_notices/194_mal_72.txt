        NIEHUSS-Marvin Lemmon. Educator, dies at 100. Professor Marvin L. Niehuss, who had a distinguished career as a teacher and administrator at the University of Michigan, died on Monday in Ithaca, New York. He was 100 years old. Upon his retirement from Michigan in 1973, the Regents of the University noted that his ''commitment and service to the University have been rarely matched'' and that ''few men in the history of the University have come to know it so well or have done more to help shape its destiny''. Professor Niehuss' fifty year association with the University began as a student in 1920. In the 1930's he taught economics and law and during World War II was the Director of Emergency Training where he coordinated all Pentagon programs on the Michigan campus. After the war, he joined the University administration where he remained for twenty-five years. He initially served as Vice President with responsibility for appropriations from the Michigan legislature, and in the 1950's he was Dean of Faculties, overseeing the academic life of the University. In 1962, he was appointed Executive Vice President and later resumed teaching at the law school in 1968. Professor Niehuss was born in Louisville, Kentucky, and graduated high school from Greenville Military Academy, Greenville, Mississippi. He is survived by his children, John and Margaret (Louis) Munchmeyer, by his stepchildren, Katharine Kapp, Susan Burgess, and Roy Burgess and by four grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.
