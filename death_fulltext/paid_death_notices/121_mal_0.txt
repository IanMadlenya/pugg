        BLOOM-Eli. Loving friend of Chan Jones. Adored father of Edward and Laura. Cherished grandfather of Molly and Max Bloom, and Miles Chandler. Dear brother of Jeanette Bronstein. He was a mentor to many and a friend to all. An icon in the automotive industry. Oh how we miss you, Dear Eli. Memorial service at ''The Riverside'', 76th St and Amsterdam Ave, NYC, 7PM, Wed. 2/5/97.
        BLOOM-Eli. He blazed an incredible trail over three decades now and left lasting footprints on the journey of legions of this town's young. Serving 2 terms as Board Chairman of Daytop during a period of rising drug crisis, he made the recovery of young lives his paramount concern & special passion, although his pressing leadership role in America's burgeoning automobile industry would have demanded otherwise. ''Kids come first!'', he reminded us so often. A quintessential New Yorker, he sprung from the loins of the nostalgic '30s and a loving Bronx family. He was never able to forget his roots. And Eli Bloom's life engraved upon the journey of all our lives the tender apostrophe to caring captured by Sam Foss: ''Let me live in my house by the side of the road and be a friend to man!'' May a loving, caring God welcome him home. Our prayerful support for his loved ones! (Msgr) William B. O'Brien President Daytop Village, Inc.
