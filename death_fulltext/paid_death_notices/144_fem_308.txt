        EDWARDS-Ethel. Ethel Edwards, an artist, friend, and teacher, died on January 24, 1999, at her home in the Gainsborough Studios, New York City. A native of New Orleans, Ethel attended Newcomb College, where she met her husband, of 62 years, the artist Xavier Gonzalez who passed away in 1993. Ethel and Xavier were both instructors at the Art Students League, where they were both dedicated supporters of the school and generations of students. Ethel was for many years on the board of the Truro Center for the Arts at Castle Hill, MA, and the Artists' Fellowship. She was a member of the Cosmopolitan Club and the Century Association in New York City where she exhibited. She will continue to inspire and encourage others through her exuberant works of art in the collections of the Baltimore Museum of Art, the Newark Museum, Colby College, and many other collections. Ethel and Xavier embodied their art with a style and lust for life, a spirit they shared with all who met them on their many travels and at their homes in New York and Wellfleet. Ethel was an artist for all seasons, full of warmth and with an intense discipline to create.
