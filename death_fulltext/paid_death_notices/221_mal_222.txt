        MENDEL--Werner, born on November 9, 1934 in Mainz, Germany and died June 26, 2005 in Harris, NY.

Husband of Stephanie Paradise; father of Susan, William, Richard and Barry from his marriage to Jane Wyker; and grandfather to Alexa, Mia, Gregory, Jason and Marc. Werner will be missed most for his ability to create his visions, whether in the world of finance or in building New Age Health Spa, an oasis for its loyal guests. His family and friends will miss his spirit, intelligence and sense of humor.
