        POWERS--Helen F. We are deeply saddened by the passing of our friend and colleague, Helen Powers. Helen played a formative role at Greenwich House as the camp administrator for 25 years, providing summertime experiences for thousands of children. She and her husband, Maxwell Powers, the agency's second Executive Director for over 25 years, were an invaluable team that brought Greenwich House into a new era, including the launch of one of the city's first substance abuse treatment programs. We will miss her wisdom and passion for Greenwich House and extend our condolences to her daughters, Judy, Sharon and their families. George A. Davidson, Chair Board of Directors Roy Leavitt, Executive Director & CEO Greenwich House, Inc.
