        TENENBAUM-Jeanne. Died of ovarian cancer on September 15, 1999, she was 90. She was a teacher. All of her fifty or more working years were spent in New York public schools in the education and defense of high school children. She developed ''Project Able'' which brought together local schools and community businesses to enable students in trouble and in financial need to continue their schooling while acquiring work experience. She was a dancer. When she was young she danced with Charles Weidman and followed modern dance, ballet and classical music with lifelong concert and performance subscriptions. She studied piano in her youth with occassional hiatuses but it seemed almost most seriously when, in her late 80's, she studied with Sophie Feuerman, who was in her 90's. She never lost an active interest in the lives of her friends and family as well as the life of her neighborhood, the Upper West Side, and her city, New York. She was married to Samuel Tenenbaum for many years. They had no children, but she was devoted to her nieces and nephew, her grandnieces and grandnephews. She worried about them, encouraged them and in the authoritative voice of the matriarchal aunt, could speak quite sharply. She offered her friends, her agemates and those younger deep loyalty and concern. It was as though she had a great gift, true attentive friendship. She is survived by her older brother, Dr. Victor Goodside and his wife, Ray, by her younger sister, Grace Paley, and those nieces and nephews from five to 60 who will not forget her. A memorial service will be held in about three weeks at a place to be announced.
