        KAISER-Alexander, of Walnut Creek, CA, on January 29, 1999. Longtime resident of Rockville Centre. He will be missed by Jeanne, the ''love of his life'' and his wife for 55 years; by his children, Jan Swan, Ellen Kaiser, and Michael Kaiser, MD; by their partners, Rick Swan, Max Elbaum, and P. Louis Sanders, MD; and by his prized grandson, Blake. A graduate of Cooper Union, former local chair of the Service Corps of Retired Executives, Al volunteered for and supported countless Jewish and community organizations. He readily lent a hand to one and all-whether relative or friend of many decades, or new California friend. We will remember Big Al for his warm heart, good humor and loving guidance.
