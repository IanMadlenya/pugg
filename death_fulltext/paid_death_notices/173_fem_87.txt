        NETTO-Kathryn C. On June 6, 2001, at age 72. Beloved wife of Eldo, loving mother of David, devoted daughter of the late Frank A. and Madelyne Cosgrove. Interment private. The family warmly invites friends to attend a memorial service to celebrate Kate's life at St. Vincent Ferrer Church, Lexington Ave and 66 St, Wednesday, June 13th, 3 PM. Kate was a private person with the most generous heart whose philosophy was that only kindness matters. She valued her family and friends above all else. Her father's contribution to the building of Johnson & Johnson and the Cosgrove family's support of the Metropolitan Museum of Art made her proud, but Kate's greatest happiness came from the love of a son and husband who will miss her every day. Contributions in Kate's memory may be made to The Museum of Natural History, in honor of the Children of the City of New York.
