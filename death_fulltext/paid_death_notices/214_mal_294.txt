        RIVLIN--Moshe. Ronald S. Lauder, Russell F. Robinson and the Jewish National Fund Family mourn the passing of Moshe Rivlin, KKL/JNF World Chairman from 1976 to 1997. Mr. Rivlin was called the King of the Forest. A seventh generation Israeli, he was a man of vision and one of Israel's true pioneers. May the memory of his lifetime's work live forever.
