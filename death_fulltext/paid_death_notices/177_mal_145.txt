        CAHAN-William G., M.D. The staff and leadership of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center mourn the death of William G. Cahan, our colleague and friend for more than half a century. We extend our condolences to his wife Grace and to his children. As a clinician, researcher and teacher, Bill strived to improve the treatment of cancer, particularly breast and lung cancer. Yet simply treating cancer was not enough for Bill, and early in his career he began a lifelong crusade to prevent the disease. Bill quickly recognized the danger posed by tobacco use and became a tireless advocate for the eradication of smoking, and a persistent critic of the tobacco industry. His forceful advocacy was important in changing America's attitude toward tobacco use. Bill was a man of great integrity, intellect and personal charm. Laurance S. Rockefeller James D.
