Services Friday, February 3, at Temple Beth Or, 56 Ridgewood Rd., Washington Township, NJ.

        BERSON--Ronald. We are all deeply saddened by the loss of our colleague and friend, Ron Berson. He was kind and gentle and had the knowledge and interests of a Renaissance man. A member of the Bar for 50 years, he truly devoted himself to his clients. We extend our deepest sympathy to his loving family: his wife Carol, his children Daniel and Jill, and his grandchildren Lucy, Adam, and Mazzi. We celebrate his life and mourn his passing.
