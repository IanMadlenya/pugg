        MULLIN-Dr. Margaret M. On February 1, 2001. Beloved wife of the late Matthew Kabriski who preceded her in death January 1, 2000. Dr. Mullin was born August 12, 1910, in NYC. She enjoyed a long career of teaching and guidance, influencing the lives of thousands of students for nearly 50 years. She began her work as a teacher of high school mathematics and then as Dean at Fort Hamilton High School. She was a faculty member of the School of Education of NYU and did post-doctoral study in Europe. She was a member of the Founding Faculty of Bronx Community College. Teachers inevitably have the opportunity to influence the lives of their students. This is a privilege which Dr. Mullin sensed instinctively and with sensitivity throughout her entire professional and post-professional life. Her work was deeply appreciated by her family and her many students and colleagues. Friends may call at the Lloyd Funeral Home, 214-43 39th Ave., Bayside, NY, Monday, February 5, 2-5 and 7-9 PM. Mass at 9:30 AM, Tuesday, February 6, at St. Michael's Church, 136-58 41st Ave., Flushing. In lieu of flowers, please consider donations to the William and Sylvia Silberstein Aging and Dementia Research Center of the NYU Medical Center; 212-263-5700.
