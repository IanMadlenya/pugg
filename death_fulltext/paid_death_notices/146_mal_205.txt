        ROOT-Stanley Roy. On March 6, 1999. Our beloved brother, a big man both in stature and accomplishments, was a source of pride and inspiration to us, to his children, and to his ten nieces and nephews. A busy man who always had time to give advice and counsel whenever asked, and make us laugh too. We will love you and miss you forever. Your brother Martin Root, sisters Barbara Root Rubin, Sandy Root Carol and brother-in-law Herbert S. Rubin. Services, 10:30AM Tuesday March 9, Temple Beth-El, New Rochelle.
