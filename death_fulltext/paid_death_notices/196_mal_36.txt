One of the finest magicians of the twentieth century, former president of The Harry Roz Ring of the International Brotherhood of Magicians, lifetime member of the Society of American Magicians, a founder of the legendary magical think tank, The Thirteen, and inventor of many magical creations. A suave, urbane performer with a twinkle in his eye who brought laughter to his audiences as well as amazement, his joyous presence will be missed by family, friends and peers.
