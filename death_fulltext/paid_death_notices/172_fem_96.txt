        KURZ-Jessie I. A beloved aunt to countless nieces and nephews, devoted wife of the late Aaron Kurz, and a friend to all with whom she came in contact, Jessie I. Kurz passed away on May 8, 2001, at the age of 97. Mrs. Kurz, affectionately known by everyone as just ''Aunt Jessie,'' was a pioneer in psychoanalysis and a contributor to many worthy causes. Those of us who knew her will always treasure her warmth, sensitivity, practicality and understanding. The celebration of her life and teachings will resonate soundly through generations of family and friends as we all describe to our children what we learned from this truly remarkable, inspring person. Contributions may be made in her name to the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association Inc. NYC Chapter, 360 Lexington Ave, 5th Floor, NY, NY 10017.
