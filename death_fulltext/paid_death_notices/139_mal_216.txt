        AMES-Thomas-Robert, Ed. D. The consumers, staff and members of the Board of Trustees of YAI/National Institute for People with Disabilities mourn the passing of Dr. Thomas-Robert Ames, a passionate advocate for the rights of people with developmental disabilities to lead lives of productivity and fulfillment. He was a pioneer in developing communitybased services for people with disabilities and, as a professor at the Borough of Manhattan Community College (CUNY), he inspired and prepared a generation of professionals to work with people with disabilties. He will long be remembered for a lifetime of helping others. A memorial service is scheduled for 1:30 pm on Friday, September 18th in the Great Choir of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue at 112th Street. It was Dr. Ames' wish that, in lieu of flowers, contributions be sent to the New York League for Early Learning, 460 West 34th Street, New York, NY 10001-2382 to further support programs and services for infants and children with developmental and learning delays and disabilities.
