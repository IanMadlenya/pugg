        QUILICO-Louis. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of our beloved colleague and friend, Louis Quilico. A versatile and generous artist, he sang 278 performances with the company between 1972 and 1994, and created the roles of the Bishop in ''Esclarmonde'' and Coroebus in ''Les Troyens'' in the Met premieres of those works. He appeared in Met telecasts as Renato in ''Un Ballo in Maschera,'' Rodrigo in ''Don Carlo,'' and in the tile role of ''Rigoletto.'' We extend out deepest sympathy to his wife, Christina; our colleague, his son, Gino; his daughter, Donna; and all his family and friends. Joseph Volpe, General Manager James Levine, Artistic Director
