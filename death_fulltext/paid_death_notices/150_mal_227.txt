        CRAWFORD-Morris D., Jr. Rusty Crawford was the first Chairman of the non-profit 42nd Street Developent Corporation almost twentyfive years ago, and lucky for us he was. If we were able to jump-start the rescue of West 42nd Street it was because Rusty jump-started us. He financed the construction of Theatre Row; he found us the money to buy the then-derelict Crossroads Building; he introduced us to (among others) the Ford Foundation. The truth is, very little progress would have been possible over here without him. He is missed already. The Board of Directors 42nd Steet Development Corp/ The 42nd Street Fund
