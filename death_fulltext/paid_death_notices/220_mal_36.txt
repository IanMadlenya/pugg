        TOWNSEND--Paul. Friends and supporters of the North Shore-Long Island Jewish (LIJ) Health System are deeply saddened by Saturday's passing of Paul Townsend of Bellport, New York. A life Trustee of the Northshore-LIJ Health System, Mr. Townsend was one of the founders of North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, NY, and served as chairman of the hospital Board of Trustees. He was a Long Island advocate of the highest order, working tirelessly to ensure that the region's economic growth did not compromise the Island's environment and community spirit. He and his wife, Terry, met at the hospital, and later started their own public relations firm before becoming editor and publisher of Long Island Business News. We extend our sincerest condolences to Terry, a daughter, Wendy Townsend of Seattle; sons Tobin of Manhattan and Kim of Glen Head; six grandchildren and two greatgrandchildren. Dan de Roulet, Chairman Michael Dowling President & CEO North Shore-LIJ Health System
