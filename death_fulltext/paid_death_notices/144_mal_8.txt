        GOLDSTEIN-Frank H. - Would have been 107 today (but fell short by 22 years). He faced all the difficulties of our century and despite them persevered and by persevering he triumphed. He succeeded in raising five children who became contributors to the strength of America, his adopted country which he loved so dearly. He reared spiritually, physically and psychologically sound children who remain forever in his debt. Those loving children.
