        MANNY-F. Albert, died Friday, January 14, at the age of 82. A graduate of Grinnell College in Iowa, Albert worked for many years for Metropolitan Life Insurance and, until his death, was secretary for the Metropolitan Retirees Association. A student at the Alliance Francaise, as well as the New School and NYU in recent years, he was passionate about the arts in New York City, visiting art galleries and attending theatre and concert performances as often as five times a week. He is survived by his brother Everett Manny, and sister Marilynn Hazard, of Toledo, Ohio, many nieces and nephews, and dozens of dear friends who treasured his warmth and intelligence. The lights of the city he loved burn less brightly tonight.
