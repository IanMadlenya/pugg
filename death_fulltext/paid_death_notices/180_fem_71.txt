In a varied and accomplished life, she graduated from Wellesley College in 1945 and went on to work with displaced people after World War II with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and was a volunteer for the Unitarian Service Committee, sending medical missions to war-torn countries.

Before and after her retirement, she served on the school's Board of Directors and was active in many community affairs. Eunice was the wife of John R. Latham, an avid sailor who predeceased her in 1980 and with whom she cruised the Mediterranean in their 60-foot steel ketch ''Hebe.''

Stunkard of Bryn Mawr, PA; three stepchildren, Scott Latham of Chester Springs, PA, John Latham of Lancaster, PA, and Katharine Butler of Sarasota, FL, and two grandchildren, Luke Butler of New York City and Victoria Latham of Chester Springs.
