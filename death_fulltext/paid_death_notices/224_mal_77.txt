        CLEMENTS--H. Millard, on August 29, 2005. The NYU Steinhardt School of Education mourns the loss of H. Millard Clements, Professor Emeritus, global educator and former co-director of the Environmental Conservation Education program. Throughout his 35 year career in the Department of Teaching and Learning, Millard taught his students to incorporate communication technologies, environmental and peace advocacy into their teaching. A founder of YouthCaN, Youth Communicating and Networking, Millard worked with young people to develop online communities and cooperative projects. His goodness, humanitarianism, and steadfast devotion to good causes inspired his students and colleagues. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Phyllis, and family.
