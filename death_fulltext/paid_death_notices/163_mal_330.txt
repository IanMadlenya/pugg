        ROOME-Norman S. MD. The Board of Trustees and Medical Staff of Lenox Hill Hospital express their sorrow at the passing of Norman S. Roome, MD, a distinguished member of our Department of Surgery for 27 years. A gifted diagnostician and skilled surgeon, Dr. Roome was highly respected by his peers and patients alike. It was obvious to all those fortunate enough to have known him that he truly loved the art and science of medicine. Dr. Roome took great joy in sharing his knowledge with young physicians who, in turn, valued the opportunity to learn from such a devoted teacher. The entire hospital family honors the memory of this kind and gentle man who exemplified the highest standards of his profession. We extend our deep sympathy to his wife Yvonne and family. James S. Marcus, Chairman, Board of Trustees Gladys George, President & CEO Allen H. Collins, MD, MPH, President Medical Board Valavanur A. Subramanian MD, Director Surgery
