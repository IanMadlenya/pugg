        GIFFUNI-Andrew. The real estate industry has lost one of its master builders with the death of Andrew Giffuni on Wednesday, March 5th. Andy and his brother Joseph created Giffuni Brothers in 1947. They built thousands of affordable apartments throughout New York City. Andrew established the Joseph Giffuni Boy Scout Award to honor his brother's memory. They were an inseparable pair with impeccable reputations in the industry for the quality of their developments and for their integrity and honor. Deepest condolences are extended to his widow Alice, his son Vincent and niece Joann Wellner. He was a rare gentle person whose presence will be deeply missed by our industry.
