        ALBERTS--Zora. Died Tuesday of breast cancer. Her courage, kindness and curiosity continue to inspire those who knew her, especially her grandchildren, Eva, Nicholas, Daniel, and Reesa; her children, Chuck, Nuna, Norman, Rick Kashuk and Kathy Olson; her closest kin, Katie and Milada Alberts; and her friends. Despite many challenges, she still believed in possibilities and because of her, we will, too.
