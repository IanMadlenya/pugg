        ROTHSCHILD--Edith. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Ralph and Sandra Rothschild and Steven and Linda Rothschild on the loss of their cherished mother. As the regal and elegant matriarch of the family, Edith had a deep love and devotion to her family and to the State of Israel. May the memories of her warmth and kindness bring solace to her loving children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren and may the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
