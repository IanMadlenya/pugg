        BERG-Copy. Of Manhattan and Bridgehampton. Age 47. On January 27, 1999. Copy was active in the Gay civil rights movement for many years. He attained his M.A. from Pratt Institute, then began his career as an artist. He was in numerous exhibitions and in 1998 the Robeson Gallery at Rutgers University held a retrospective of his work. A large collection of his work is housed in the Rare Books and Manuscripts sections of the NY Public Library. His long-time partner, Paul Nash, predeceased Copy in 1993. Copy is survived by partner Dub Williams, his grandfather Vernon Berg, Sr., his mother Vera Berg, siblings Valerie Berg Rice, Victor Berg, and Vincent Berg, and by his nephew and niece Elia and Kiran. A memorial service will be held at the Frank E. Campbell Chapel, on Saturday, January 30, at 3:30 P.M. Copy requested memorial donations be made to The Lamba Legal Defense Fund (212-809-8585) or Visual Aids (212-627-9855).
        BERG-Vernon E., III (Copy). The Board and Staff of Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund mourn the death of our friend and former client. Some 25 years ago, Copy was a Navy ensign whose courage in challenging the Military's anti-gay policy resulted in a Pentagon order to grant honorable discharges to all past and future service members kicked out for being lesbian or gay. In Copy's spirit, Lambda continues to fight for the right of all lesbian and gay military personnel to serve our country with honor, dignity, and equality. We extend our sympathy to his partner, Dub Williams, and the rest of his family.
        BERG-Copy. Visual AIDS staff, Board of Directors and Archive Project members join in expressing our sorrow at the death of Copy Berg. An eloquent spokesman in the fight against AIDS, Copy was an inspiration to us all. Our deepest sympathy to his partner Dub and to his family.
