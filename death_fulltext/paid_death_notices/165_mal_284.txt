        SHERMAN - Sanford N. The trustees and staff of the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services are saddened by the loss of Sanford N. Sherman, one of the foremost pioneers in family therapy and a leader in creating the Jewish Board 22 years ago. Mr. Sherman served as executive director of the Jewish Family Service, one of the agency's predecessors, just before its 1978 merger with the Jewish Board of Guardians, the move that established JBFCS. Mr. Sherman was among those who initiated the merger. A consummate practitioner, author and teacher, he was also a voice for social justice and the editor for many years of the Journal of Jewish Communal Service. We express our deepest sympathies to Mr. Sherman's two sons, Richard and Ralph; his four grandchildren; and other members of his family. Joseph S. Kaplan, President Alan B. Siskind, PhD., Executive Vice President Paul Levine, CSW, Associate Executive Vice President
