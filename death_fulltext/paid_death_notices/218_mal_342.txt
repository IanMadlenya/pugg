        WAGNER -- Rodney. The Board of Trustees and Staff of Sesame Workshop deeply mourn the loss of Rodney Wagner on Thursday, March 24, 2005. His commitment to encourage education in developing countries throughout his career served as an independent source of inspiration for our international work. Through Rod's support, we were able to make a meaningful impact using media to inspire millions of children to read and write, to share and cooperate. As a member of Sesame Workshop Board of Trustees for over two decades, Rod will forever hold a special place in our history and our hearts. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family. A Memorial Service will take place at the American Museum of Natural History on April 22, 2005 at noon in The Powerhouse, 2nd Floor, Weston Pavilion. Vincent A. Mai, Chairman Joan Ganz Cooney, Chair, Executive Committee Gary E. Knell, Pres and CEO

Mr. Wagner was deeply committed to improving the lives of poor families in developing countries, and also served on the boards of the World Wildlife Fund, American University in Beirut and Lewis Preston Education Fund for Girls.
