        BARNETT-Henry L., M.D. The Division of Pediatric Nephrology of the Children's Hospital at Montefiore and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine records with deep sorrow the passing of our mentor, colleague and friend. His leadership led to the establishment of pediatric nephrology in this country and abroad, and to the creation of the International Study of Kidney Diseases in Children. He was rightly considered the father of pediatric nephrology. His research and teaching resulted in the improvement of the quality of life for children everywhere. He will surely be missed.
