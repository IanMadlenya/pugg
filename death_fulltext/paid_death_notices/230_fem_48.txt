        PALMER--Julia Reed, 90. Of New York City and Mt. Desert, Maine, on February 25, 2006, after a long life and a brief illness. Wife of the late Arthur E. Palmer, Jr. Beloved mother of Constance Hildesley, Lansing Palmer, Stewart Palmer and the late Susan Palmer, all of New York City. Devoted grandmother of Mark Hildesley, Morgan Hildesley, Laura Bartsch, Lansing Palmer, Jr., and Blair Palmer, and great-grandmother of Griffin and Spenser Bartsch, Emma and Sophie Hildesley, and Rebecca Palmer. She was an inspiration in the field of literacy, and continued to teach and to campaign for her causes to the last day. She had an answer for all, delivered with an earnestness belied by a twinkle in her eye. We will miss her always. Funeral service private. A memorial service will be held in Maine at a later date. In lieu of flowers, a contribution may be made to Jan Hus Presbyterian Church, 351 East 74th St, NY, NY 10021.
