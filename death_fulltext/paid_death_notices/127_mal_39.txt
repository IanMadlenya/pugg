        CATAPANO-Frank. After a long and valiant battle against cancer, died on Saturday, August 2, 1997, at Lenox Hill Hospital with his loving family at his side. He leaves behind his beloved wife of 43 years Joy (nee Franks), three adoring children Joanne, Andrew, and Joy, his cherished grandchildren Jonathan, Taylor and Charles. He was a true gentleman and was admired and respected by everyone who knew him. He will be sorely missed and always remembered. May he rest in peace. As per his wishes, Catholic services and burial will be private. If friends wish, they may make a contribution in Frank's memory to the Department of Medicine at Lenox Hill Hospital, NYC, or the American Cancer Society.
        CATAPANO-Frank. Dear friend, we shall miss you. Helen and Alan
