        ARRON-Judith. Jaime Laredo, our Music Advisors and all of us connected with the New York String Orchestra Semimar, send deepest sympathy to a valued former Seminar participant, Eddie Arron, his father and brother. As we begin our 30th Seminar, we reflect with gratitude and affection upon Judy's close relationship with Alexander Schneider, her commitment to young musicians and Carnegie Hall's particiaption in our project. Judy was one-of-a-kind. We will miss her dearly. Frank Salomon Founder/Administrative Director Rosemarie Russoue Administrator New York String Orchestra Seminar
        ARRON-Judith. ''Friend'' was who Judy was - to musicians and to the public through the ways she illuminated our lives at Carnegie Hall, to her family and those of us who got to know her through her warmth, love and the extraordinary role model of courage she was for us all. She will remain an important part of who we all are. Martha and Frank Salomon
