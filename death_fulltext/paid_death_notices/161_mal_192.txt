        BISGYER-Melvin. The Board, staff and clients of Community Access are deeply saddened by the passing of a dear friend. As a longtime Board member, Mel shared his dedication, love and warmth with all who met him. His humanity and ability to make a person feel good, especially a person who had suffered great difficulties, was a special gift. We will all miss him immensly.
