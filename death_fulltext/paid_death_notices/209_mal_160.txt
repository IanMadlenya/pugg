        FINGEROTH -- Nathan D. Born in Poland and raised in NYC. Passed away on Sunday, June 13, 2004. Nathan was the beloved husband of the late Fran and the loving father of daughters Joyce and Sharon and son-in-law Robert. He was an adoring grandfather to Johanna, Sara and Leah Fine and was deeply devoted to his brother Al. A long-term resident of NYC, Nathan watched with amazement as the city he loved grew. He was a supporter of many progressive causes and an inveterate adventurer--ever ready to explore his world. A gentle kidder with a mischievous twinkle in his eye, he was the most rugged individualist you ever met. Rest in peace. Services June 15 at Riverside Chapel, Manhattan.
