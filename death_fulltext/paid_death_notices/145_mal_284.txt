        McCLENDON-Warren. The entire Greenwich House community is deeply saddened by the loss of our dedicated colleague, Warren McClendon. For 26 years he was a loved and respected counselor and long time union delegate, who devoted himself to caring for clients and fellow colleagues. We will miss his gentle kindness, wisdom, humor and generous inspiration. We extend our deepest condolences to his partner Catherine Cody and his family.
