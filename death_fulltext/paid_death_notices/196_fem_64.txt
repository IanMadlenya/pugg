        SOSNE-Norma. Born September 20, 1925, deceased May 7, 2003. Survived by her adoring children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and countless friends. She gave us the gifts of love and laughter. She spread her cheer everywhere she went. Freed from the bondage of a terrible illness, her spirits are lifted but our hearts are broken.
