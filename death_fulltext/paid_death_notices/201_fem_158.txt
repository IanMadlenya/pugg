        JOHNS -- Margaret. The Trustees and staff of the World Monuments Fund mark with great sadness the death of Margaret Johns. With her husband, Peter Stern, Vice Chairman and long-serving trustee of the World Monuments Fund, Margaret shared a passion for the work of the organization and participated with energy and intelligence in countless WMF events, trips, and gatherings. She brightened our lives with her informed and cheerful enthusiasm and greatly expanded our knowledge through her own many accomplishments, as a scientist, gardener, artist, music lover, reader, and passionate traveler. She will be missed by all. Our heartfelt condolences go to her beloved family including Peter Stern and daughters, Kate Johns and Sara Griffen.
