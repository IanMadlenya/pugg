        FOGARTY--Richard R. Dearly loved longtime Board member of Odyssey House and Odyssey Foundation, Rich will be deeply missed for his kindness, humility, and friendship. Rich was an unfailing supporter and champion of the men, women, and children in treatment for substance abuse and mental illness. His style of leadership, forging strength, clear vision, compassion and empathy, was felt by all those he touched at Odyssey House. Our deepest sympathies to his family.
