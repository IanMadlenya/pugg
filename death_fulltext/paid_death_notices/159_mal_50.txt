He was born 1926 in Sydney to Edna Mason, an Australian of British descent, and Edgar (Ed) Kaula, an American of Czech descent. He graduated from West Point Military Academy in 1948.

He frequently served NASA as a project participant (e.g.,team leader for the altimeter on Apollos 15, 16, & 17); proposal reviewer (e.g., chair of the Lunar & Planetary Review Panel); and program advisor (e.g., twice member of Space Science Board). His other principal association outside UCLA was with the American Geophysical Union (AGU), as section officer, journal editor, and advisory committee member. In the mid 1980's Bill took leave from UCLA to serve three years as head of the National Geodetic survey (NGS) in NOAA. He received three honors: The Whitten medal of the AGU; The Brouwer medal of the American Astronomical Society; and, in 1987, membership in the national Academy of Sciences (NAS). Bill is survived by three daughters and his wife, Gene Hurley Kaula.
