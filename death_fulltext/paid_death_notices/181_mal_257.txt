        ROBERTS-Myron, M.D. The Boards, Faculty, and Staff of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons deeply mourn the passing of our distinguished colleague Dr. Myron Roberts. For 41 years until his retirement in 1997, he was an invaluable member of the Department of Urology-an excellent surgeon and diagnostician, a knowledgeable consultant, and, above all, an outstanding teacher, who trained generations of the country's leading urologists. He was a winner of Columbia Presbyterian's Distinguished Practitioner Award. We extend our deepest and heartfelt condolences to his family.
