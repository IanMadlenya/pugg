        EPSTEIN--Barbara. The New York Review of Books mourns the loss of our esteemed colleague Barbara Epstein on June 16, from cancer. Barbara, co-founder and co-editor of The New York Review, was at her desk working on the paper, as she had for the past 43 years, as recently as two weeks ago. She was born Barbara Zimmerman in Boston, and educated at Radcliffe College. In 1952, Barbara championed the publication of The Diary of Anne Frank in the US. Before co-founding The New York Review, she was an editor at Partisan Review. Along with Jason Epstein, Robert Silvers, Robert Lowell, and Elizabeth Hardwick, Barbara founded The New York Review of Books during the long news blackout of the New York publishing strike in 1963. With Barbara and Robert Silvers as editors, this small group of friends created a new kind of magazine--one in which the most brilliant minds they could find would discuss current politics, books, art, and culture in depth. The first issue included pieces by Elizabeth Hardwick, Mary McCarthy, W.H. Auden, Robert Penn Warren, Norman Mailer, and Gore Vidal. Barbara Epstein, as coeditor of The New York Review, was equally fierce as a protector of the rights and causes she believed in and as a champion and mentor for younger writers. She worked long and tirelessly on articles that exposed injustice and that presented new talent to readers. She had a particular love for the arts, and that love infused much of the work published by the Review. Memorial donations in Barbara's name may be made to the following organizations that work on behalf of AIDS orphans in sub-Saharan Africa and a variety of justice, health, and human rights issues: CAFOD (www.cafod.org.uk), the Firelight Foundation (www.firelightfoundation.org), FXB USA (www.fxb.org), or Save Africa's Children (www.saveafricaschildren.com).
