        BLUM--Samuel. The American Friends of ALYN Hospital is deeply saddened by the death of Samuel Blum, who, with his beloved wife Simone, founded our organization. Sam was a lifelong supporter of the handicapped children who are treated at ALYN Hospital in Jerusalem. Sam remained a valued Board Member until his death; his financial advice, passion and commitment to our work will be greatly missed. The ALYN family offers condolences to Simone, our Chairman Emeritus, and her entire family. We are grateful that the Blum Family has asked that donations in Sam's memory be directed to ALYN. Minette Brown, President American Friends of ALYN Hospital, NY, NY
