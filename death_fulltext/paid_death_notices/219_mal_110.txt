        SCHULMAN -- Louis. Great Neck Synagogue notes with sorrow the passing of its beloved Cantor Emeritus, Chazan Eleazer Schulman. His sweet voice and inspirational prayers have elevated generations of congregants, and his melodies remain a staple of their spiritual lives. To his dear wife Hilda, and to his entire family, we wish strength and good memories during these difficult days.
