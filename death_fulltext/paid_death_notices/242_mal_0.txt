        HARNICK--Jay. The Board of Directors, the Founders Circle, and staff of TheatreworksUSA mourn the passing of our beloved emeritus Artistic Director and founder, Jay Harnick, who guided and shaped the development of Theatreworks. For over forty years Jay's artistic judgment was integral to our growth as a nationwide company that now benefits audiences of over four million children per year and is the largest in its field. We valued his inspirational leadership and moral center in dealing with the challenges of a large organization. Many young writers, composers, directors and actors benefited from his direction and compassion in helping them realize their best work. We honor his memory and miss our dear friend. Our hearts are with his wife, Barbara and children, Jane and Aaron.
