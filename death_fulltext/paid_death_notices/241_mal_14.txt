        MACKLIN--Gordon S. The Madoff Family mourns the loss of our dear friend and colleague Gordon S. Macklin. His wisdom and leadership of the National Association of Security Dealers personified the highest ideals of broker dealer self-regulation. His vision of a highly automated and transparent electronic stock market led to the creation of NASDAQ and helped define the standards for today's global market structure. We offer our condolences and heartfelt sympathy to The Macklin Family.
