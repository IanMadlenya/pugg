        SHAPIRO--Dr. Howard. The sudden loss of Dr. Howard Shapiro of Westport, CT who died October 13 at just 66 years of age, leaves his sisters, Mrs. Barbara Marion of Boca Raton, FL and Dr. Bonnie Auerbach of Sherman Oaks, CA, with the memories of a loving brother who was deeply missed by all those whose lives he touched.
