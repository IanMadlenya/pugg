        HAMILTON--George Heard. The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art note with sorrow the passing of our Life Trustee George Heard Hamilton. His scholarship was unparalleled, and the art historians whom he trained and influenced are innumerable. As Chairman of the Committee on Painting and Sculpture, he deeply influenced the shape of the Museum's collection. His relationship with the Museum began in 1929, when, as a sophomore at Yale, he visited the first exhibition we mounted. Since then, his love for and knowledge of the Museum--and for the artists and staff who have shaped it--grew and buoyed us all. We extend our sincerest sympathies to his wife, Polly, and to their family. David Rockefeller, Chairman Emeritus Agnes Gund, President Emerita Ronald S. Lauder, Chairman Robert B. Menschel, President Leon D. Black, Chairman, the Trustee Committee on Painting and Sculpture Glenn D. Lowry, Director The Museum of Modern Art, NY
