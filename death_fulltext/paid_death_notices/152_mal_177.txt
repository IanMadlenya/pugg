        HECHT-Jack. The world is a poorer place for the passing of Jack Hecht. He was my mentor before the word was fashionable. A man of towering compassion and integrity, his humility and simplicity belied an astute, diverse intellect and humor. He taught me much about consideration for people, which was central to his personal and business life. I owe him a debt that I can never repay, but the lessons I learned from him will be with me always. My sincere condolences to his wife Laura and his entire family. Richard Roth
