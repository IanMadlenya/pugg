        KAMPEL--Daniel. The Board of Trustees, officers and staff of HIAS, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, fondly and warmly remember Daniel Kampel for his devoted service as a Board member. Dan's passion for the HIAS mission was endearing and became a part of his core values. In addition to being extremely generous to HIAS he was also a consummate fundraiser for the HIAS scholarship program, which awards scholarships to gifted children of recent immigrants. We extend our condolences to his wife, Laura, and the Kampel family. Jerome S. Teller, Chair of the Board Gideon Aronoff, President and CEO
