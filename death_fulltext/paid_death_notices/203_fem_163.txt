        GREENBERG--Gwen Joy. 39, of New York City, NY. Gwen was the beloved daughter of Paul, sister-in-law of Fred Tuck and beloved aunt to Lauren 14, Amanda 12, Jake 10 and Will 5. Adoring sister of the late Jill Tuck and daughter of the late Lenore Greenberg. All three of these incredible women were tragically lost to us in an automobile accident near Akumal, Mexico on Saturday December 20th. Gwen was a graduate of the University of Virginia and the University of Richmond where she completed a Masters in Sports Administration. She took her deep love of sports to the next level and worked for the Washington Bullets. She later became the Alumni Director for Brooklyn Law School. Gwen's life revolved around her family and she was a second mother to her nieces and nephews. They traveled together extensively and she was a pillar of support for all of her family and her numerous friends. She was loved by many in spite of her devotion to the Dallas Cowboys and we all miss her more than these words can express. Services Friday, December 26th, 10 A.M., at the Larchmont Temple, 75 Larchmont Ave, Larchmont, NY 10538.
