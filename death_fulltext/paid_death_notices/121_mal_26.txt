        PERLMAN-Julian. The Directors of the Norman and Rosita Winston Foundation mourn the passing of our dear friend and colleague, Julian Perlman. A man of deep integrity, high intelligence, and generosity of spirit, he was dedicated to the culture of our time, the city of New York, and the future of Israel. Julian was fair, compassionate, wise, idealistic. Always considerate and caring, he enriched our lives with warmth, humor, and most of all, loyalty. We are deeply grateful for having known and worked with him. Richard A. Rifkin, Laurie Friedland, Arthur Levitt, Jr. Dir. Emeritus
