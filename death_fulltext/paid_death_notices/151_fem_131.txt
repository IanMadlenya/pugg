        HABERMAN-Rebecca. A week ago when her pain was extreme, Rebecca Haberman expressed a wish to simply go to sleep and ''slip into paradise''. Last friday, August 13, 1999, a few weeks past her 79th birthday, she realized her wish, slipping away after a painful night. A remarkable woman loved by all who knew her and admired for her long and valiant fight against a non-Hodgkins' lymphoma that finally overwhelmed her, she leaves behind her stricken husband of 51 years, Harry, her devoted daughter Louisse, and innumerable grieving friends and relatives. At her request there is to be no funeral.
