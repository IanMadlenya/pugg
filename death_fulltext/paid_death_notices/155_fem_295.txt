        KUSHNER-Florence, of Huntington, Long Island. Her sudden passing has devastated all who knew and loved her. She was full of love, compassion, and she shared her everlasting love and devotion with her beloved husband, Herbert, and loving children, Glenn, Donna and Terri, adoring grandchildren, sonin-law, and devoted family and friends. All will miss her. Love, Rose and Sid Kay
