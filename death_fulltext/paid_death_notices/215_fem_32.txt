        MARKOVA--Alicia. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of Dame Alicia Markova, one of the outstanding ballerinas of the twentieth century and director of the Metropolitan Opera Ballet from 1963 to 1969. The company was privileged to witness her remarkable artistry, not only in her many performances in the opera house with American Ballet Theatre, but as solo dancer in our productions of ''Die Fledermaus'' and ''Orfeo ed Euridice'' and as the choreographer for many Met productions. Her elegance, grace and classical purity are legendary and her warm and generous spirit will be greatly missed. Joseph Volpe, General Mgr. James Levine, Music Dir.
