        SAVITT-Marvin, Hazzan. The Cantors Assembly records with sorrow the passing of a respected colleague for over four decades. Quietly and gently, he served the spiritual needs of his congregants with great dignity, warmth and care. We extend our sympathy to his wife Harriet, his children and all his loved ones. May his memory abide as a blessing. Hazzan Henry Rosenblum, Pres. Hazzan Abraham B. Shapiro, Executive Administrator
