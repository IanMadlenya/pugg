        KATZ--Rabbi Dr. Michael. The administration, faculty, students, and alumni of Yeshiva University and its affiliate, Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary, record with grief the passing of one of its longest serving and most beloved professors of Talmud and Bible, who was a Rosh Yeshiva for 59 years and the first Rosh Yeshiva ever appointed to the Bible faculty of Yeshiva College. He also served as spiritual leader of Congregation Petach Tikvah, Bronx, NY for 20 years. Born in Amdur Grodna, Poland, he was the scion of the world-renowned Chief Rabbi of Petach Tikvah, Israel, Rabbi Reuven Katz, and brother of distinguished scholars and rabbinic leaders, all of blessed memory. He was ordained by Israel's Chief Rabbis Avram Yitzhak Kook and Yitzchak Isaac Herzog, as well as by Rabbi Avigdor Amiel, Chief Rabbi of Tel Aviv, and Rabbi Issar Zalman Meltzer of Eitz Chaim Yeshiva, Jerusalem. He earned a Teacher's License at Hebrew University in 1940, was a graduate of Yeshiva College, BA'45, and Bernard Revel Graduate School, DHL '63. He was the respected author of several erudite volumes. He was a father figure and friend to thousands of students. Heartfelt condolences are extended to his beloved wife of 59 years, Rebbetzin Hinda Katz, to their children: Zahava (and Michael) Jeff, and Yitzchak (and Elaine) Katz, and to their 6 grandchildren and 3 great grandchildren. May the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel, President Norman Lamm, Chancellor Morry J.
