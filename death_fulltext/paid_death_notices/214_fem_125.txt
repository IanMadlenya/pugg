        CORMAN--Judith. The directors, staff, and residents of Phoenix House mourn the loss of a dear friend and colleague. Judy Corman was an officer of Phoenix House, who started and ran our volunteer program and headed our national communications department. She believed passionately in our mission and relished her work with young people struggling to start new lives. She went on to pursue a brilliant career in public relations but remained forever devoted to Phoenix House and her friends here. Loyalty was Judy's strong suit, for she would do anything for a friend. We will miss her--her wit, her humor, and her good sense. Edward D. Miller, Chairman Mitchell S. Rosenthal, M.D., President Kevin E. McEneaney, Executive Vice President
        CORMAN--Judy. The Women's Forum records with sorrow the death of its esteemed member, Judy Corman, a woman of extraordinary accomplishment. Deepest sympathy is extended to her family, friends and colleagues. Dede Thompson Bartlett President Women's Forum, Inc.
