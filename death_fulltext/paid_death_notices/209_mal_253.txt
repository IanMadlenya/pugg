        DOLLARD--Michael. 71, on June 24, 2004. His passion, knowledge, humour and eccentricities will be missed by his family and friends. His indomitable spirit for life and art will be with us forever. He is survived by wife Dongju (Angie), three children, Marcus (Kathy), Lilith and Timothy, and grandchildren Nola and Anders. In lieu of flowers, donations in his memory to Development/American Museum of Natural History, New York City or a charity of your choice.
