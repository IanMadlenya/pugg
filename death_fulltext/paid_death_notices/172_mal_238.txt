        MICHAELI-Joseph, M.D. The Boards, Faculty, and Staff of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and Weill Medical College of Cornell University mourn the untimely death of our colleague Dr. Joseph Michaeli. An Associate Professor of Medicine and Associate Attending Physician in the Division of Hematology/Oncology and Chief of the Multiple Myeloma Service at New York Weill Cornell Medical Center, he was widely recognized as an expert in myeloma, and he published extensively and helped countless patients. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife and family.
