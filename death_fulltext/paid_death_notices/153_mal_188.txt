        KAHN-Melvin, M.D. The faculty and staff of the Samuel Bronfman Department of Medicine of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine and Mount Sinai NYU Health mourn the loss of our esteemed colleague Dr. Melvin Kahn. Dr. Kahn first came to Mount Sinai in 1953 as an intern and went on to advanced training in cardiology and renal disease at Mount Sinai and the National Institutes of Health. Based on his distinguished research contributions, his caring and expert care of his patients, and his devoted and loving service to Mount Sinai, he has served with distinction as Clinical Professor of Medicine since 1984. He was a leader in housestaff recruitment and was a wonderful role model for young physicians. We will greatly miss his warmth, his sense of humor, and his friendship. We extend our sincere condolences to his family. Barry S. Coller, M.D. Chairman
