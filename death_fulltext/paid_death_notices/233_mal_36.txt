        GOODMAN--Barbara F. Beloved Barbara, we'll miss you so much, our hearts are broken. We have shared a lifetime together starting when you were the most adorable freshman to grace a Harvard campus. From the moment Roy met you at that ''freshman mixer'' he was smitten for life. When Larry met Dalia the twosome became a foursome. Our memories include a chronology of love, marriage, children, godparenting and grandchildren. We shared so many wonderful experiences bringing up our children and enjoying travel adventures around the world. Barbara, you possessed such grace and beauty. You were so kind, so good, so giving, so wise, so feminine, yet strong and independent. You were a loving and caring mother. Claire's, Leslie's and Randy's fine qualities and virtues do credit to your maternal devotion. Beezie, no husband has ever had a more noble and loving wife. Roy was blessed from the day he met you. Yours was the most admired and loving marriage we have ever known. Ashley and Tracy weep for you at this sad time. We mourn for Barbara and pray for God to bless Roy and give him the strength to carry on and go forth with his life. Dalia and Larry
