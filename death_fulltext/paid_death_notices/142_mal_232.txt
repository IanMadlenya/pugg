        BARON-Raymond S. The Officers, Board of Directors and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the loss of Raymond S. Baron, a cherished friend of the Jewish community. As past president and a member of the Board of Directors of the Herman Goldman Foundation, a staunch supporter of UJA-Federation, Mr. Baron has left a legacy of hope for all those touched by his generosity and concern. His philanthropic traditions live on in the selfless dedication of his son, Richard, who is executive director of the Foundation. We extend our sincerest condolences to Richard and his wife, Margaret; Mr. Baron's daughter, Ronnie Hirsh, and her husband, Fred; and his grandchildren, Jodi, Lara, and Alan. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair James S. Tisch, President Stephen D. Solender, Exec V.P.
