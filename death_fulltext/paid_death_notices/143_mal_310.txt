        BAER-Morris (Moe). September 3, 1914-December 18, 1998, of Del Ray Beach, FL., passed away peacefully in his sleep after many years of extended illnesses. The sweet, quiet, WWII veteran leaves behind a legacy of wonderful memories for his family and friends. He lived his life in a manner best described by paraphrasing a quote from Micah 6:8 ''Do justly, Love mercy, and Walk humbly with Thy God.'' His loss is devastating, but he will live forever in the hearts and minds of all who were privileged to know and love him, especailly his beloved and dedicated wife of nearly sixty years, Ethel Hershkowitz Baer and their devoted children, Leslie and Richard Romanoff, Stephen H. Baer and Vivian Mook Baer; their cherished grandchildren and great grandchildren, Scott Adam Romanoff and fiancee Jennifer Miller, Ian Joseph Baer, his wife Jacqueline and their adored children, Justin and Elise. Services and Shiva were observed privately by the immediate family. A memorial service will be conducted at a later date. In lieu of flowers, contributions would be appreciated donated to The Palm Beach Blood Bank, Inc., 933 45th St., West Palm Beach, FL 33407, 561-845-2323, ext 230, Att: Grace Kerns, Executive Assistant, or charity of personal choice.
