        ALOI-Enrico L. Born May 24, 1922 in NYC. Died March 24, 2002 in NYC of a brain tumor. His livelihood was as a commercial artist, but his passion was art and music, especially opera. His love for the great opera diva Rosa Ponselle inspired him to publish 3 books on her life, her performances, and his personal remembrances of knowing her for the last 24 years of her life. He is survived by his sister Anna Di Maria, his niece Catherine, her husband Joseph Wargo, and his longtime friend and companion Joseph K. Puglisi.
