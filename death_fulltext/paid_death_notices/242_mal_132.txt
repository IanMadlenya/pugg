        STEITZ--Jack, 82, of Manhattan, died peacefully March 9. Proud son of the late John J. Jr. and husband of the late Kitty Montaner, Jack was a decorated World War II veteran who lived in New York City his entire life. A kind and generous man, he will be missed by those he touched. He is survived by his loving sons, Bradlee and Brian, his grandchildren Samantha, Jeffrey, and Maxwell, and daughters - in - law, Kathy Hipple and Ana Steitz. Part of our cherished Greatest Generation, Jack's sweetness and special love will be sorely missed.
