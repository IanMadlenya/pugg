        DiCLEMENTE - Frank F. (''Deke''). On Friday, September 28. For four decades Deke was a beloved mentor and counselor-on the playing fields and in the Physical Education Department-to thousands of young men at Phillips Academy Andover. After graduating from Springfield College (MA) in 1935, he joined Andover the same year as an instructor in chemistry and assistant in the Physical Education Department. He coached varsity basketball starting the same year. Along the way he developed an intramural competitive system for Juniors in various team sports. Beginning in 1947 Deke coached soccer until his retirement in 1975. Under his guidance the team achieved its first-ever victory over arch-rival Phillips Academy Exeter in 1952. During the next 11 years his soccer teams defeated Exeter seven times. Survivors include his wife Bernadine of Andover, MA; his daughter Ann Ross of New York City and son Jim DiClemente. Deke will be greatly missed by all those alumni whose lives he touched during their young and formative years. Reg and Lois Collier PA, 1945
