        FRIEDMAN--Gerald J., M.D. The Tufts University community is deeply saddened by the passing of our esteemed friend and benefactor, Dr. Gerald J. Friedman. Dr. Friedman's colleagues in medicine and nutrition at Tufts and Tufts-New England Medical Center, one of its affiliated teaching hospitals, recognize the many important and far-reaching contributions he made to the study and practice of internal medicine, cardiology, diabetes and metabolism, endocrinology and clinical nutrition. In honor of his and Mrs. Friedman's exceptional philanthropy and as a tribute to his commitment to advancing knowledge in the field of nutrition, Tufts named the Gerald J. and Dorothy R. Friedman School ofNutrition Science and Policy. Also in recognition of his distinguished medical career and their wonderful generosity, Tufts named the Gerald J. and Dorothy R. Friedman Endowed Professorship in Nephrology at the School of Medicine. In 2001, Dr. and Mrs. Friedman were awarded the Tufts Presidential Medal for their vision and generosity, belief in the power of education to change the world, and commitment to research and scholarship that will affect countless lives. We will always be grateful for Dr. Friedman's extraordinary support of the life sciences. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Dorothy, his niece, Jane, and the entire Friedman family.
