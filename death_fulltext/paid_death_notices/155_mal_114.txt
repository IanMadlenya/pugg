        WILSON-John, Sir. The ORBIS International organization worldwide mourns the loss of Sir John Wilson, a legendary force in the prevention of blindness. As a founding member of ORBIS' Advisory Council, he was a great inspiration to us ever since our inception. His pioneering and unparralleled work in focusing worldwide attention on blindness has helped protect the gift of sight for countless thousands around the world. We extend our sincerest sympathies to the Wilson family. International Board of Directors, ORBIS International
