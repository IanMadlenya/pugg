        COLEMAN--Dr. Lester Laudy was one of my father's closest friends. They played handball at eight and enjoyed a friendship that lasted over 75 years. Laudy saved my life at five years of age. He was my doctor, adopted uncle, friend and if necessary he would have been my Rabbi. There are not enough ways to express the genius of Laudy Coleman--a scholar, author, doctor, jokester, humanitarian, a ''jack of all trades''-a renaissance man-a LEGEND. The man behind the legend may now be gone but the legend will live on for this absolutely wonderful adoring human being. Ken Laub
