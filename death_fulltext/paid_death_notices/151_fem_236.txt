        PAGANO-Deborah. The Creative Center for Women with Cancer wishes to express its profound sympathy to the family of Deborah Pagano, a cherished member of our Board of Directors. In addition to her clear vision, strength of spirit and wise judgment for which she was enormously valued, Debbie gave all who knew her an uncommon gift-a grace and a selflessness which were undiminished by her illness. Her shining spirit remains with us always. Geraldine Herbert, Director
