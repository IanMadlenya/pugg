        MATZKIN-Rose Ellis. Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, announces with great sadness the death of its 15th National President, who served 1972-1976. During her tenure, Hadassah University Hospital on Mt. Scopus was reopened and Kibbutz Ketura was founded in the Arava. A lifelong Zionist, she served in numerous capacities within Hadassah and the Zionist world, holding many portfolios and offices. A member of President Ford's Task Force on Women, she was also an honorary life member of the Board of Governors of the Hebrew University. She got her start with Hadassah as the president of the Waterbury Chapter and served as president of the Connecticut Region. A gracious presence and powerful orator, she will be missed by countless devoted Hadassah friends and admirers. Predeceased by her beloved husband, Dr. Max Matzkin, she leaves behind children, Dr. Michael Matzkin and Hannah Lavine, their spouses, four granddaughters and two great grandchildren. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Bonnie Lipton National President
