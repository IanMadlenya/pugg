        BROWN--Arnold Armistead. January 29, 1927 to January 5, 2004, after a brave battle with cancer. Beloved father, he leaves a daughter Melissa, a son and daughter-in-law, Thomas and Emilia, and their sons Pablo and Simon. Not least, his dear bird Billy. His passionate spirit and his love of music and nature will not be forgotten. Donations to the Norman Bird Sanctuary, 583 Third Beach Road, Middletown, R.I. 02842.
