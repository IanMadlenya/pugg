        LASKY--Jerome M. On January 15, 2005 at the age of 83. The attorneys and staff of Moses & Singer LLP mourn the loss of our friend and colleague. Jerry Lasky was graduated from Columbia Law School in 1948 as a member of Law Review and a Harlan Fiske Stone scholar. He spent his entire legal career at Moses & Singer, first as an associate, then as a partner, Managing Partner for several years and, most recently, as counsel. Jerry also served Nassau County, where he lived for many years, as a District Court Judge. Jerry was a superb lawyer and valued counselor, whose enthusiasm for the practice of law continued to the day of his death. His intelligence, imagination, humor, great common sense, practicality and boundless energy enabled him to excel in every area of the law he tackled, but his unique talents were most evident in complex real estate litigations. Jerry was always a concerned and compassionate friend to his colleagues. We will sorely miss his booming voice and towering presence in our corridors and his sympathetic ear in our offices. We extend our deepest condolences to his loving wife Lila, to his daughters Beth and Rhonda, to his son-in-law William Metzger and to his grandson Scott.
