        HOROWITZ--Lewis. The Department of Pediatrics at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center deeply mourns the passing of Lew Horowitz, a wonderful man and huge spirit, who, as a volunteer, provided his warm heart, his engaging and humorous stories, outlandish hats, popcorn and cookie nights and unstinting hours of support and encouragement to the courageous children we treat, their steadfast parents and all of us who knew him and treasured his friendship.
