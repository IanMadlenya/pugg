        BERMAN-Sylvia. On behalf of the entire NYU Medical Center community, we note with great sorrow the passing of Sylvia Berman, who served as an Associate Trustee of the NYU Medical Center Board of Trustees since 1969. In 1998, she became an Associate Trustee of the Board of Trustees of Mount Sinai NYU Health. She was the President of the Lila Motley Cancer Foundation, which has generously supported cancer research at NYU School of Medicine. Mrs. Berman was a good friend and we will miss her deeply. We offer our sincere condolences to her husband, Sol Berman; her daughter, Barbara Weinburg; her son, Arthur Rosenstein; her sister, Gertrude Kurshan; and her grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Stephen M. Peck, Chairman, Board of Trustees, Mount Sinai NYU Health Robert M. Glickman, MD, Dean, NYU School of Medicine Theresa A.
