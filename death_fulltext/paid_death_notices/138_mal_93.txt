        BERGER-Curtis. The Trustees of The University of Rochester and the Staff of the Office of Alumni Relations and Development convey their condolences on the passing of a friend. Curt, Class of 1948, was an active alumnus, extraordinary law teacher and a gentleman. He had a long University association-His father Samuel graduated in 1917, his son John in 1978-and he shared his enthusiasm for teaching with both his Columbia Law School students and the University of Rochester Alumni.

With deep gratitude for his commitment to the legal profession and devotion to Columbia, we extend our heartfelt condolences to Vivian and to all family and friends who join us in mourning his passing.
