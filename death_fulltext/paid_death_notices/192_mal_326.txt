Mr. Schwartz was born in Brooklyn, New York on November 9, 1937 to Joseph and Yetta Schwartz. Raised in Williamsburg, he attended the New York School of Printing during his high school years. Upon graduation, he was awarded a full graphics arts scholarship which he chose to forego in order to support his family during his father's severe and protracted illness. He proudly took on this responsibility and landed a job at The New York Times where he would work in varying capacities for the next forty years, until 1996.

The family moved to CoOp City in the Bronx in February 1970, where a second son, Mitchell Brian, was born to them on July 25, 1972. In October 1989, the family moved to Riverdale, New York. Seymour Schwartz is survived by his wife, Elaine, and his two children, Joseph and Mitchell, as well as by his three grandchildren, Jake, Chloe and Benjamin. He will be fondly remembered by his family and friends as a loving, kind family man who made many sacrifices, but was always happy to put others before himself.
