        TITONE--Hon. Vito J. Wisdom, compassion and understanding are benchmark qualities of a life well-lived! In navigating the shoals of life's journey, they serve to arm the traveler with renewed strength of character. Judge Vito Titone came to the side of a legion of this town's shadow--children adrift in the rising tide of drugs and hopelessness. How tall he stood in his rescue efforts as a leading Governor of Daytop Village, Inc. over these four decades. Heaven blessed us, indeed, in his presence among us. May a good and loving God welcome him home after a memorable journey. May God strengthen and console his beloved Peggy and family. Msgr. William B. O'Brien President, Daytop Village Inc.
