        RADLER--Rabbi Evan C., 42, spiritual leader of Hillcrest Jewish Center, died suddenly late Sunday night. His funeral took place at the synagogue Tuesday. Burial was at New Montefiore Cemetery. Rabbi Radler who grew up in the New York area was ordained at Yeshiva University. The rabbi was an accomplished communicator, teacher and scholar. His sermons were always timely, interesting and distinguished by the fact that Rabbi Radler never used notes and could quote from a wide range of sources in his presentations. The rabbi's sense of humor was a mark of his very effective capacity to reach out to everyone he dealt with. Rabbi Radler is survived by his wife, Mindy, and his mother, Norma. Contributions may be made to the Rabbi Evan C. Radler Memorial Fund at Hillcrest Jewish Center.
