        ROSS--Edythe. Beloved wife of the late Dr. Jerome H. Ross. Cherished mother of Lorraine Ross Goldman. Dear and adored friend of so many. A woman of elegance, indomitable strength and courage who loved life and was an inspiration to all, especially the physically disabled. A beautiful woman, an outstanding mother, grandmother and great-grandmother, whose intelligence and strength of mind fought the ravages of physical hardship always with a smile and a desire to forever love her family. Her vital presence will be deeply missed. Services, Friday, November 21, 11:15 AM at Riverside Memorial Chapel.
        ROSS--Edythe ''Moms''. Today I have lost the best part of me--YOU! My lifelong friend, my beautiful role model, my mother. I can only find solace in the knowledge that you are at peace and no longer struggling to live. Every child should be blessed with a mother like you. Those who are whisked away by material things are paupers in the eyes of G-d. Lori
