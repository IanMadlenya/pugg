        KUFELD-Henry. Of South Fallsburg, NY, on June 24, 2001 at age 83. We mourn the passing of Henry ''Buddy'' Kufeld, our beloved uncle, brother-in-law and loving husband of the late Georgia Kufeld, OBM. The last surviving sibling of one of Brooklyn Jewry's foremost families, Buddy bore the name Kufeld with pride and dignity. He served his country with bravery and sacrifice during World War II, and was fully committed to Jewish life in his community. Buddy won our hearts forever with his kind and gentle manner, and devotion of all of his family. We will miss him always. The Krause, Kufeld & Michaelson Families
