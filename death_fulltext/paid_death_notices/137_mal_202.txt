        TAYLOR-Luke Joseph, June 17, 1998. This unique and sensitive spirit was taken suddenly from a bewilderingly large and loyal circle of family and friends. Given a second chance at life Luke showed by his tenacity, humor and comforting presence what it means to be human. His appetite for knowledge, his ability to see through sham and cant, his carefully crafted prose and generous instincts will always inspire all those he loved and touched. We love you, Luke. Your father and mother J. Gary Taylor and Mary Ann Quinson, step parents Pat Taylor and Bruno Quinson. Your brothers Geoffrey, Adam and Joshua. Step brothers and sisters Tim, Chris, Peggy, Wendy and Janet and their families. Nephews and nieces James Giles, John Christian and Alexandra. Uncles and aunts Peter Taylor, Hadley Fisk, Vivien Malloy, Ed Goodman, Pam Lichty and their families. Luke was the grandson of the late Nena Manach, and Andrew Goodman, and Margaret Clark. Mass of Christian Burial at Saint Thomas More Church, 65 East 89 Street, on Saturday, June 20th, at 11 A.M. Interment New Marborough, Mass. In lieu of flowers contributions in his memory may be made to the New York Public Library.
