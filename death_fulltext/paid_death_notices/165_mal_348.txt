        CARROLL - Robert M. The Trustees and Staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn with deep sadness the passing of their respected colleague and friend, Bob Carroll, who was Armorer in the Department of Arms and Armor. At the Museum for the past 31 years, he was responsible for the conservation and installation of one of the largest and most important collections of arms and armor in the world. Always in good humor and with a sharing spirit, he worked in an unbroken tradition that had been passed down since the Middle Ages from one master craftsman to the next, using a combination of centuries-old tools with modern techniques. We extend our condolences to his entire family. He was an exceptional man. He will be greatly missed. Philippe de Montebello, Director
