A student at Horace Mann Academy, Michael was a scholar who truly excelled in all forms of creative expression.

At the early age of 12, he was already a master of four languages. Michael dreamed of being the best at all he attempted and always succeeded. His brothers and sisters loved him deeply, and he was the life of every party. Michael's intellect was surpassed only by his kindness. He changed this world for the better and will be greatly missed.
