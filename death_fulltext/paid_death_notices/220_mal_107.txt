        DeROSE--James F. Died on May 7, 2005. He was 71 years of age and left a rich legacy, both professional and personal. Almost immediately after graduating from Akron High School in 1950, he joined IBM, and in his 30 years with that organization, worked on projects ranging from SAGE I (New York Air Defense Sector, the IBM 3600, the Gemini/ Apollo Space Launches, New York Stock Exchange floor trading system, to the precursors of the ATM and an early hand-held commercial data radio terminal. In 1979, he received a Sloan Fellowship to complete his MA in Business from Stanford University. After retiring from IBM, he published four editions of ''The Wireless Data Handbook''. A lifetime of interest in things nautical, which included sailing, lead to his authorship of ''Unrestricted Warfare'', an account of the early years of submarine warfare in World War II. His work--and his gift for telling a good story--led to an appearance on a documentary on submarines, still being shown on the History Channel. His first wife, Nancy Fisher, predeceased him. He is survived by his wife Judith, his mother Helen, his daughters Linda DeRose Primavera, Jane DeRose Evans, Margaret DeRose Douglas and seven grandchildren. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations to the American Cancer Society.
