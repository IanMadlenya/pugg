Ahrens, Jr., who was the Frederick Henry Leonhardt Professor Emeritus. A pioneer in the study of fatty substances known as lipids, Pete Ahrens made seminal contributions to unraveling the diet - heart disease puzzle. Throughout more than four decades of insightful, innovative research at The Rockefeller University Hospital, he also inspired and trained generations of physicianscientists.
