        DAVIS--Ossie. We are deeply saddened by the loss of this outstanding artist and human rights activist. He was always there to help others, including the Working Theater, achieve their goals. He will be missed. As a member of our Board of Advisors, we will live by his words, ''don't mourn; organize.'' Our deepest sympathies go out to his remarkable wife Ruby Dee and to his children.
