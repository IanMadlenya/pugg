        MULDOON -- Sylvia. The Board of Trustees of Saint Vincent de Paul Residence, Kateri Residence and Saint Teresa's Nursing Home mourn the passing of their dedicated Trustee. Mrs. Muldoon was instrumental in the creation of Saint Vincent de Paul Residence and was a founding member of the Boards of both Saint Vincent de Paul and Kateri Residence, and had long been involved with the work of the Catholic Health Care System (CHCS), Padre Pio Shelter and Saint Anthony's Residence. In addition, she served on the Board of Catholic Charities of the Archdioces of New York and was the inaugural recipient of the Msgr. Raul del Valle Award from Saint Vincent de Paul, for her tireless efforts on behalf of those the Residence served. We are deeply saddened by her passing and offer our prayers and condolences to her family. She will be sorely missed and long remembered with respect and affection. Karl P. Adler, M.D., Chairman, CHCS, Board of Trustees of Saint Vincent de Paul Residence Saint Teresa's Nursing Home Kateri Residence
