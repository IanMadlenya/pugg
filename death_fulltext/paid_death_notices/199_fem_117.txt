        FRIEDMAN -- Sylvia. The Board and Staff of The New York Association for New Americans (NYANA) are deeply saddened by the passing of Dr. Sylvia N. Friedman, who served as President of the Board in the 1980's and was a valued Board member of NYANA for more than 25 years. Dr. Friedman was predeceased by her husband, Harold Friedman, and son, Judge Lewis Friedman, who also served on the NYANA Board of Directors. Sylvia's indomitable and tenacious dedication to NYANA's mission of providing resettlement and social services to refugees and immigrants was unsurpassed. During her tenure with NYANA, Sylvia was committed to giving new life to thousands of refugees fleeing oppression from the Soviet Union, Iran, Syria and South East Asia. She served many causes with distinction and dedication, giving her leadership to the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS), the UJA-Federation of New York, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, the Council of Jewish Federations, the American ORT Federation, the Jewish Braille Institute of America and the Lexington School for the Deaf. We extend our sincere condolences to Sylvia's daughter, Dr. Diane Friedman, grand-daughter, Karen Friedman, daughter-in-law, Bernice Friedman and the entire Friedman family.
