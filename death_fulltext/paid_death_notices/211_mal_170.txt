        MILLER -- J. Irwin. The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art note with sorrow the passing of J. Irwin Miller, a businessman, philanthropist, and advocate for exceptional design. Irwin began his relationship with the Modern in 1960, when David Rockefeller introduced him, and his wife Xenia, to the Museum's then curator, Dorothy Miller. Miss Miller suggested some galleries to visit where the couple was introduced to and began collecting works by Wassily Kandinsky, Mark Rothko, Sam Francis, and Milton Resnick. Ten years later, Irwin was elected to MoMA's Board of Trustees and served for five years, after which he became a Life Trustee. Of course, Irwin's greatest legacy is the very town in which he lived. Through the Cummings Engine Foundation, Irwin turned Columbus, Indiana into a living repository of modern architecture by commissioning public works from masters such as Eliel and Eero Saarinen, I.M. Pei, and Richard Meier. He embodied corporate responsibility as one of the first executives to believe that corporations should engage in the communties where their businesses were located. In doing so, Irwin forever changed the face of a city. He will never be forgotten, but he will be sorely missed. We extend our sympathies to the entire family. David Rockefeller, Chairman Emeritus Agnes Gund, President Emerita Ronald S. Lauder, Chairman Robert B. Menschel, President Patricia Phelps de Cisneros, Chairman, Trustee Committee on Architecture and Design Glenn D. Lowry, Director The Museum of Modern Art, N.Y.
