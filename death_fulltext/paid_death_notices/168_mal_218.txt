        BURT-William R. 1914-2001, Hilton Head Island, SC-Col. (USAF ResRet) died January 8 at his home. He was 86. Col. Burt had an illustrious career in the Army Air Corps during World War II and in the Air Force Reserves thereafter. He was a Wall Street attorney, business executive, venture capitalist, rancher and real estate investor.
