        COHEN--Alan N. The National Basketball Association notes with sadness the death of our colleague Alan N. Cohen. A longtime and highly respected member of the NBA family, Alan began his association with the league in 1974 when he was named CEO and Chairman of Madison Square Garden, which owned the New York Knicks. He later served in ownership roles for the New Jersey NETS as well as the Boston Celtics during the team's championship years of the 1980s. As an executive, team owner and Chairman of the NBA's Board of Governors, Alan made enormous contributions to the growth of the league, most notably as an architect of the NBA's landmark revenue sharing/salary cap system in 1983. In addition to his relationship with the NBA, Alan was distinguished as both a successful businessman and generous humanitarian. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife Carol, daughters Rebecca and Laurie, son Gordon and sister Beryl. Jerry Colangelo, Chairman David J. Stern, Commissioner
