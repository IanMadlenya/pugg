        LUBIN--Tillie. The American Committee for the Weizmann Institute of Science mourns the passing of longtime friend and benefactor, Tillie Lubin. She was a valued member of the Board of Directors and the President's Circle. Along with her family, she provided unwavering support to the Weizmann Institute of Science, creating initiatives such as the Charles W. and Tillie K. Lubin Center for Plant Biotechnology, the Charles W. and Tillie K. Lubin Chair of Hormone Research, and Charlie's Place, a cafeteria that has become one of the most popular meeting places on the Institute's campus. Her warmth and insight touched the lives of many. We send heartfelt condolences to her daughter, Sara Lee Schupf, past Chair of the American Committee, and all members of her loving family and wide circle of friends. She will be deeply missed.
