She was married for 27 years to her second husband, artist and musician Maurice Kursh, who died in 1987, and was stepmother to Mr. Kursh's children by a previous marriage, Paula Kursh of Sebastopol, CA and Stephen Kursh of New York. Her remains will be interred in the Olmsted family vault in Hartford, Connecticut.
