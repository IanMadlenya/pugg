        BERKLEY-Robert. Rarely are we blessed with such a combination of compassion, humor and a deep desire to care for family and friends. We will miss his laugh, his irrepressable honesty and his undying generosity. In death, as in life, he is inspiring. We continue to learn, Grandpa, and we will never forget. We love you always. Evan and Family
