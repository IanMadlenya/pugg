        JOHNSON-Deane F. Members of the Board of Trustees and staff of the American Red Cross in Greater New York note with sadness the loss of Deane Johnson, loyal member of our Board of Trustees in the 1980s and the 1990s. Mr. Johnson ably led our community appeal and was a trusted advisor to Red Cross staff members and trustees alike. Under his leadership Time Warner was a generous supporter of Red Cross and Red Crescent efforts locally, nationally and internationally. We extend our deepest sympathies to the Johnson family. The American Red Cross in Greater New York Jonathan O'Herron, Chairman Robert M. Bender, Jr., Chief Executive Officer
