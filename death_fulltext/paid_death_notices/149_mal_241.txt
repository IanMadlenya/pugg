        JACOBSON-Gaynor I. The officers and executive staff of United Jewish Communities deeply mourn the recent passing of Gaynor I. Jacobson, a very significant professional leader of the Jewish community whose influence was felt throughout the Jewish world. He was executive vice president of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society from 1968 to 1981. His dedication and leadership in assisting Jews worldwide was universally recognized and he received honors from many nations, including Brazil and Israel. Our sincere condolences to his wife, Florence, and to his two daughters. Charles R. Bronfman, Chairman of the Board Joel D. Tauber, Chairman of the Executive Stephen D. Solender, Acting President
