        KAUFMAN--Lenore, 61, deeply loved by her husband David, sons Jake and Adam, and adored by her father, brother and sister. A dedicated educator and impassioned teacher, she taught hundreds of children the joy of reading and the writing for joy. She will be greatly missed by all the worlds she touched as parent, teacher, musician and supportive friend. She was an inspiration to all.
