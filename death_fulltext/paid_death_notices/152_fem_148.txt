        DUERBECK-Heidi B. We mourn the loss of our beloved friend and colleague. Heidi loved life. She saw beauty in the world and goodness in people, and she inspired others to follow her example. As a friend, she brought joy into the life of everyone she touched. As a lawyer, she had that rare gift for guiding people of diverse backgrounds to trust each other and work together in harmony. To know her was a special blessing. J. Frederick Berg, Jr., Richard E. Schneyer
