        NEISLOSS-Irma. Suddenly, our world will not be the same. Our magnificent friend Irma has passed away. She leaves her legacy of love, giving, deep caring, devotion and her wonderful family, Susan, Kathy and Richard, James and Alison, and their children. They are a standard for all. We grieve with you and will always remember her sense of fun, courage and nobility. Emily and Jerry Spiegel
