He is survived by his wife of 46 years, Ruth Gottlieb of Burlingame, CA; a brother, Henry Gottlieb of New York, two sisters, Ruth Fisch of Tampa, FL and Pearl Malkin of Larkspur, CA; two sons Adam Gottlieb of Sacramento, CA and Geoffrey Gottlieb of Santa Monica, CA; daughter-in-law Elizabeth Nelson Gottlieb.
