        KATZKI-Herbert. The Officers, Board of Directors and staff of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) deeply mourn the passing of Herbert Katzki, a giant in the history of JDC since 1936. He served overseas for 30 years. One day before Nazi troops entered Paris in 1940, he fled to Lisbon where he helped direct JDC rescue programs during the Holocaust. As representative of the U.S. War Refugee Board, he served as special attache to the American Embassy in Ankara, Turkey and, subsequently, to the U.S. Legation in Berne, Switzerland. After the war, he played a key role in the relief and reconstruction of Jewish communities in Europe and helped develop programs for Jews in Israel and Moslem countries. A man of compassion and integrity, his dignity, kindness and humility inspired all who knew him. Our hearts go out to his beloved wife, Kate, his companion and partner in healing and public service.
