        ALCHON-Bernard Forbes 83, an Orphan Train rider. Born November 1914 in NYC to Grace Forbes, father unknown, at 1 1 /2 ''Henry Forbes'' was sent by the Children's Aid Society (CAS) to Osage, IA, where adoption by Maude and Guy Alchon ''transformed a throwaway into a son.'' To honor their memory, and that of CAS founder Charles Loring Brace, Mr. Alchon recently established a college scholarship for children of the CAS. The first award will be made in 1999. A 1936 graduate of the University of Iowa, a businessman, and a resident of Highland Park, IL, Mr. Alchon was married to the late Marion Gargan Alchon of New Orleans. He is survived by a son, Guy, and a granddaughter, Lilla. Another son, Fred, died in 1974. Contributions may be made to the ''Alchon Scholarship Fund'' of the CAS, 105 East 22nd St., New York, NY 10010, or the Orphan Train Heritage Society, 614 East Emma Ave., Springdale, AR 72764.
