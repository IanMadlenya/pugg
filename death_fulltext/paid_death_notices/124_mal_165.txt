        CAVE-Vernal M.D. It is with deep gratitude that we remember our colleague and fellow board member of the Arthur Ashe Institute for Urban Health, Dr. Vernal Gordon Cave. Early in the Institute's founding, Dr. Cave gave unselfishly of his expertise, commitment and financial support. His deep understanding of the health needs of the disenfranchised communities of New York helped the Institute launch much needed programs. His warm and gentle spirit will be sorely missed by all of who were privileged to serve with him at the Institute.
