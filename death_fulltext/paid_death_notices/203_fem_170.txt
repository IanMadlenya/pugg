        HOELTERHOFF -- Olga Christina, (nee Goertz). Born May 14, 1912 in Riga in Latvia, died December 17, 2003 in Valley Cottage, NY. Her long and complicated life reflected the tragedy of the Baltic States. Driven from her beloved home in Jurmala by Hitler and Stalin, displaced and often ill, she survived through tenacity, intelligence, and compromise. For 45 years, America offered her a bewildering refuge where she cherished her small house, many pets and her only child, and freely expressed her views, most recently on shooting bears and invading Iraq in a selection of five languages. Her curiosity, love of the arts (especially the Metropolitan Museum) and memories of Riga, Hamburg, Milan, Berlin, Saloniki, Venice and Franco Corelli are lovingly treasured by her makeshift family: Manuela, Francesca, Marilyn, Sheila, Irene, Margaret, Hilda, Eddie, Pince Pince, Sugar, Emma, Minnie, Sparkle, Tosca, Cosimo. And, from another realm, her husband Heinz Alfons Martin Hoelterhoff and her mutt Apple.
