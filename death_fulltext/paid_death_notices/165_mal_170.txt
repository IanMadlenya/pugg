        ROBINSON - Horace Brookes Blackwell. The Board of Trustees of NYU Downtown Hospital note with sadness the passing of Horace B.B. Robinson, a distinguished officer and life trustee of the Board for more than five decades. Mr. Robinson was a great nephew of Elizabeth Blackwell, M.D., a founder of the New York Infirmary and the forerunner to NYU Downtown Hospital. In his passing we lost a dedicated trustee and a link to our past. We offer our deepest sympathy to his family. Nelson Schaenen, Jr., Chairman Ronald H. Menaker, Past Chm Susan B. Roschen, Past Chm Leonard Aubrey, President & CEO
