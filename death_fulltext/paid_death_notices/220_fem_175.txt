        EASTMAN--Monique de T. The Board of Directors mourns the death of Monique de T. Eastman. Mrs. Eastman was a longtime supporter of CR & T and showed great concern for finding better and more complete treatments for cancer. As a cancer survivor herself, she gave encouragement and understanding through her support and participation in educational and research opportunities that addressed the needs of all people with the disease. She was taken too soon from her friends and family who will miss her smile and her grace even during troubling times. Cancer Research & Treatment Fund
