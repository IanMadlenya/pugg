        HANDY--Michael J. Our deepest sympathy to Edna Wells Handy on the loss of her husband, Michael J. Handy, the Director of the Mayor's Office of Veterans Affairs for the City of New York, and also to Michael's four daughters, Jacqueline, Jannah, Kenya and Dawn, son-in law Craig, three grandchildren, Shamar, Kayla, and Maya, Michael's mother Joan Handy, his brothers and sisters Paul, Joseph, Veronica, Miriam and Catherine. Michael will be best known for his smile, his concern and his heart. He held the mantle of leadership with dignity, loyalty and poise, and everyone he touched came away a better person. In an effort to repay them for their service to this nation, his efforts, both professionally and personally, have brought to the front the concerns of veterans in this great city in order to give them a better quality of life. We have lost a true friend and a champion. May he rest in peace. Walter and Selma Kaye Kathy and Joseph Zappulla >>AD#
