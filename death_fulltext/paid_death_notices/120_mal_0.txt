        BARKSDALE - Walter Lane. The faculty, students and alumni of New York University School of Medicine mourn the loss of one of our distinguished professors, who served on our faculty for over 30 years.

Dr. Barksdale received his PhD at NYU and soon after joined the faculty. He was a Professor of Microbiology of NYU School of Medicine, a Fellow of the Pasteur Institute Paralysis Fellow. We mourn his loss and extend our deepest sympathy to his family.  Saul J.
