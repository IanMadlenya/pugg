        IDEN--John Holmes. Of Cincinnati, OH, passed suddenly on Christmas Eve 2003. A gifted pianist, John played with many of the ballet world's greatest -- including Dame Alicia Markova, C.B.E., O.B.E, Sir Anton Dolin, Alexander Danilova, Tatiana Grantzeba, Frederick Franklin, Gelsey Kirkland, Suzanne Farrell and Sulamith Messerer of the Bolshoi Ballet, Moscow. His unique style and quick wit will be sorely missed. In lieu of flowers, the family, Frank and Jackie (Monce) Iden, feels John would want donations sent to University of Cincinnati CCM dance division and/or Cincinnati Ballet.
