The Board of Trustees, Associate Board, League, Administration and Staff of Parker Jewish Institute for Health Care & Rehabilitation are profoundly saddened by the passing of beloved Trustee and Co-President of the Parker League, Lillian Wilner (''Lill''). The world has lost a shining light of goodness and love and Parker has lost its crowning jewel. Lill's compassion for people and generosity to charitable causes was matched only by her innate leadership qualities & personal warmth. She was a vibrant advocate of progressive resident and patient care, and a driving force of one the most highly respected and effective volunteer auxiliaries of its kind. Her tireless work on behalf of older adults will forever burn brightly as a model & inspiration for those who seek to add quality time to later life. We are privileged to have known her, and offer our most sincere condolences to her devoted daughter Wendy, Linda, her grandchildren, great grandchildren, and the entire Wilner family. Jerry Landsberg, Chairman of the Board Michael N. Rosenblut, President and CEO
