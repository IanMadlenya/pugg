        KATZ - Susan Kohl. The Board, Staff and Volunteers of East End Hospice note with great saddness the death of Sue Kohl Katz. As a devoted member of the Board of Directors and loyal patron, Sue worked tirelessly to further our mission. She was founder of the East End Open and the Valentine's Salon, both events raising funds in support of programs such as Camp Good Grief.
