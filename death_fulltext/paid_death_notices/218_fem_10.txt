        JORDAN--Cheryl Faithe, age 57, a flight attendant, died January 4, 2005 of breast cancer. She graduated from CCNY in 1969 where she made Dean's list and became the first black cheerleader, then cheerleader captain for the basketball team. She earned a Master's degree in French from Columbia University in 1971 on full fellowship. She spent a joyous half year in Paris, then joined Pan Am, making lifelong friends around the world, especially in Australia. In Sydney she became an enthusiastic fan of surf life-saving and was made a member of the Bronte Surf Life-Saving Club, then an unusual honor for a woman. She attended the Melbourne Cup and briefly shared ownership of a race horse. For her family, she was a dedicated and elegant caregiver, arranging flights at need, providing escort herself. Our beloved Cherrie-in Oz, affectionately Chezza-leaves her father G. Whitte and wife Amy, brother Achille Edward, sisters Blanche (Eugene) and Naomi, in-laws Francine and Elliott, nephew David, nieces Elizabeth, Miriam and Tanya. Hundreds of friends she cherished as family have said farewell in a seaside service in Sydney, and family and beloved friends held services in Seattle and Oklahoma where she was born December 10, 1947, and is buried. Other friends close to her heart will celebrate a final farewell in Honolulu. She leaves a life she loved to join our dear mother, Olivia Hebert Jordan. May Heaven grant them joy.
