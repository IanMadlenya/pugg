Ms. Brydon-Shrock, a member of our Board of Trustees since 1985, served brilliantly as Secretary of the Board, Member of the Executive Committee, and Chair of both the Personnel and Pension Committees. Her extraordinary management expertise, acquired from a distinguished business career, enabled the Center to meet and triumph over many strategic challenges. Her compassion, diligence, and commitment to help those in need will be deeply missed. We send our most heartfelt condolences to her husband, Ronald A. Schrock, and to her family. Aniello A.
