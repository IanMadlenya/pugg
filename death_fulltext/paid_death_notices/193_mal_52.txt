        HARRISON-Lou. The American Music Center's Boards of Directors, staff, and membership mourn the death and celebrate the life of one of America's truly great and original artists, our beloved composer Lou Harrison. A student of Henry Cowell and Arnold Schoenberg; colleague of John Cage, Virgil Thomson, Charles Ives, Mark Morris, and many, many others; builder of instruments; builder of musical bridges to non-Western cultures; gay man of great pride; and mentor to generations of composers and performers, Lou was a man of courage and beauty. Lou Harrison will be sorely missed, but his legacy, his wonderful and beautiful music, will forever inspire us.
        HARRISON-Lou. The members of the American Academy of Arts and Letters note with sorrow the death of their esteemed colleague whose passing will be mourned by the world of music.
