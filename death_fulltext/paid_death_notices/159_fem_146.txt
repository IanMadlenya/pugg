        GUTCHEON-Sylvia Becker. April 14, 2000. Much loved wife of Jack, mother of Jeffrey and of Peppi Graves, grandmother of David Gutcheon and Lucy Graves. She was born in New York City, lived her adult life in Washington Heights, and summered at Lake Oscawana in Putnam County. She was a consummate homemaker, and a member for many years of the Netty Leaf Bailin League. She preferred the bus to the subway because she liked to see where she was going, and no one in her family will again hear ''Tea for Two'' played on the piano without missing her. Loved and mourned by family and friends.
