        VINITSKY-Chaim. The Officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Chaim Vinitsky, an exceptional Jewish communal leader who was deeply dedicated to helping others. As the former Director General and founder of the United Jewish AppealIsrael Office, he devoted his life to ensuring the welfare and survival of the Jewish people. Even in retirement, he continued to champion Jewish causes through his extraordinary commitment and dynamic personality. UJA-Federation deeply regrets the loss of an outstanding professional who will be sorely missed by his colleagues and friends. Our heartfelt sympathies go to his wife, Pnina, and sons, Yehuda and Danny. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair Louise B. Greilsheimer, President Stephen D. Solender, Exec. V.P. Ernest W. Michel, Exec V.P. Emeritus
