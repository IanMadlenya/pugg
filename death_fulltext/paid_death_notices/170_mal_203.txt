        ROSENBLATT-Franklin D. Beloved husband of Florence, devoted father of Lief, loving father-inlaw of the late Melinda, adoring grandfather of Andre Charles who knew him as Pop Pop, and dear brother of Arthur, died on March 16, 2001. Born in Riverdale to the late Harry and Helen Rosenblatt, he was raised in Brooklyn. He studied nine years at night while holding two jobs to become a civil engineer in his own firm, and was noted for many innovative structural achievements including the design of the Venezuelan Pavilion at the 1965 New York World's Fair. A caring person who helped many others, always without fanfare, he was a true humanitarian. This special man will be sorely missed and fondly remembered by his family, his friends from his school days, and his friends from both the Berkshires and New York City. Service Monday, 10 AM at ''The Riverside'', 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue.

Our deepest condolences to his family, friends and other loved ones. Martin Cohen, President Judith S. Lewis, Senior Rabbi
