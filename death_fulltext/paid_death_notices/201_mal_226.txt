        STEIN--Dennis, (70), July 3, 1933 to October 23, 2003. Beloved father of Pamela (Earl) Kluft & grandfather of Michelle, Julianne, & Alexander Kluft. Sister of Eleanor (Joel) Hinderstein. Uncle of David (Leslie) & Glenn Hinderstein. Inside this frequently prickly man was a golden heart and a generous nature. A fixture on the sidewalks of Manhattan and at the NY Friars Club. Always impeccably dressed, well-groomed and crowned with his trademark silver hair, it was impossible not to notice him. Anyone who knew him would tell you ''To know him was to love him''. New York will never be the same. Services will be held at Plaza Jewish Community Chapel, 630 Amsterdam Ave at 91st on Sunday, October 26 at 11:00 AM. Donations may be made to City of Hope, 800544-3541.
