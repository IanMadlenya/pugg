        ZELIZER-Rabbi Nathan. We record with profound sadness the passing of our beloved colleague. In 1931, he became rabbi of Tifereth Israel Congregation in Columbus until he became rabbi emeritus in 1973. In 1980, he founded Beth Ami in Boca Raton and was also named its emeritus. He was instrumental in the establishment of the Melton Foundation for Jewish Education. We express our deepest condolences to his wife, Jeanette and children, Deborah Kaplan, and our colleague and past president, Rabbi Gerald Zelizer, and to all who were touched through his rabbinate. Rabbi Vernon H. Kurtz, President Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Exec. V.P. The Rabbinical Assembly
