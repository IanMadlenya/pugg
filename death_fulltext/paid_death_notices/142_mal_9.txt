        KLEINMAN-Kenneth R. Age 77, of NYC, died October 30, 1998. Beloved and cherished husband of Elaine for 56 years, inseperable companion, soulmate and confidant for 63 years. Graduate of Alfred Univeristy, one of the youngest Captains in the US Army-Air Force during WW II. Known in business for his acumen and scrupulousness. He is also survived by his adoring children Jill, David and Joan, his treasured grandchildren Jennifer, Jonathan, Alexandra and Emily, and his beloved sons-in-law Judd Shanker and Richard Cohen. Precious husband, father and grandfather who loved his family more than life itself. Tireless reader and unapologetic liberal, lover of science and human inquiry, imbued with wonder and awe, humble, honest, true; an exemplar of loving kindness, patience, understanding, fortitude, selfless devotion, and steadfast support. Kind to a fault, a guileless, unassuming man of grace, intelligence, gentle sweetness, with contempt for ridgid fundamentalism and false promises, with the courage to embrace uncertainty in the truthfulness of his unfailing spirit. He will never be forgotten. Forever in our hearts. Funeral services at Riverside Chapel, Amsterdam Ave and 76th St, today, at 12:30 PM.
