        LUBART--Henriette d'Arlin, Dr., youngest of eleven children, was born in Beirut. She was educated in Egypt and France. In 1939 she visited the United States to see the World's Fair and remained after World War II broke out. Her first years in America saw her involved in broadcasting in French for overseas audiences and appearing in, and directing French classical theater. She went on to a teaching post at Vassar College, married, raised a family, and completed a Ph.D. from Columbia University. After moving to to New York City, she devoted herself to sculpture, while lecturing at New York University, the Ecole Libre des Hautes Etudes, and as a volunteer, teaching French and art in inner city public schools. As an active member of the Society of Women Geographers, she accompanied her late husband, Dr. Joseph Lubart, to the Canadian Northwest Territories on his field study of Eskimo culture. She made numerous exploring trips to Easter Island, Tanzania, Sikkim, Nepal, China, and India. She was the mother of two: a daughter, Tibou (deceased), and a son, Andre. She will be remembered by her husband, screenwriter Jerome Ross, her son, her five grandchildren, and her friends, for her love of people and life. A memorial will be held in June.
