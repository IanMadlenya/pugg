        GARCIA -- Yolanda. We mourn the passing of our friend and ally, Yolanda Garcia, founder and executive director of the We Stay/Nos Quedamos Committee. Yolanda was a visionary community planner - developer, and a pioneer in New York City's environmental justice movement. She led the internationally-recognized fight to rebuild the 60+ blocks of vacant lots in the Melrose area of the South Bronx from the 1990's until her death on Thursday. A fund is being established to support the education of Yolanda's grandchildren. Contributions may be sent to Yolanda Gonzales, in C/O Nos Quedamos/We Stay, 811 Courtlandt Ave, Bronx, NY, 10452.
