        MILLER-David C. The Albert Schweitzer Fellowship mourns the loss of a cherished friend and former Board member. Dr. Miller's lifelong embodiment of Albert Schweitzer's ethic of Reverence for Life and his own insistence that ''My life is my argument'' provide an example that continues to inspire us all. We extend our condolences to his wife, Rhena Schweitzer Miller, and all of his other family and friends.
