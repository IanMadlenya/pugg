        WEISGALL-Hugo. The faculty, students and administration of the Aaron Copland School of Music at Queens College mourn the death of Queens College Distinguished Professor Emeritus Hugo Weisgall. His ruggedly beautiful, deeply emotional and superbly crafted operas, choral works and song cycles brought Dr. Weisgall international recognition and brought honor to this institution. Joining the music faculty in 1960, Dr. Weisgall inspired generations of young composers, directed the opera workshop which gave New York premieres for many contemporary works, and conducted the choir and the orchestra. We offer Nathalie Weisgall and their children Deborah and Jonathan our heartfelt condolences. Allen Lee Sessoms, President Queens College, City University of New York Hubert S. Howe, Jr., Director Aaron Copland School of Music Raymond Erickson, Dean, Arts and Humanities
