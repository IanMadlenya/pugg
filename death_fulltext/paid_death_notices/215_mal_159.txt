        MORGAN--John P. II. The Trustees, Fellows, and staff of The Pierpont Morgan Library mourn the death of John P. Morgan II. He served as a valuable member of the Board of Trustees from 1948 to 1989, when he became a Trustee Emeritus. He served as Vice President of the Board from 1952 to 1988. He was also a founding Fellow of the Library. Kind and generous, Jack gave important objects to the Library that related to the history of his distinguished family. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his wife, Claire, and his family. Charles E. Pierce, Jr., Dir. S. Parker Gilbert, President, Board of Trustees
