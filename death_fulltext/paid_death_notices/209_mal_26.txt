        GHIAUROV--Nicolai. The Metropolitan Opera deeply mourns the death of a unique artist and beloved colleague, Nicolai Ghiaurov. With his large, velvety bass voice and imposing stage presence, he created a sensation in his 1965 Met debut as Mephistopheles in ''Faust.'' In a Met career spanning thirty years, he sang 81 performances of ten roles, ranging from the title role of ''Boris Godunov'' to Padre Guardiano in ''La Forza del Destino.'' But he will perhaps be best remembered for his most frequent Met role, his noble King Philip in ''Don Carlo.'' It is with great sorrow that we extend our sincerest sympathies to his wife, Mirella Freni, and his family. Joseph Volpe, General Manager James Levine, Artistic Director
