        WECHSLER-Betty. We extend our sincerest condolences to Marcel Wechsler, Benny Wechsler and Susan Rhein on the passing of their beloved mother. A true ''Eishes Chayil'', she embodied the qualities of elegance, charm and kindness. Betty and her late husband, Sammy, a Founding Board Member and past Treasurer, were Silver Founders of the Medical Center. She was a devoted member of the Shaare Zedek Ladies Auxiliary and personified the highest standards of Tzedakah and Chesed, in her love and support of important Jewish causes that build and strengthen Israel. May the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Amer. Comm. for Shaare Zedek Jerusalem Med. Ctr.
