        McINTYRE-Helen P. The board and staff of the Long Island Community Foundation are profoundly saddened by the death of Helen McIntyre, who chaired this foundation with wisdom and courage from 1984-1998, and graced its board from 1980 until 2002, in recent years chairing the grants committee and then the director's council. Her dedicated and constructive leadership, her extraordinary but gentle strength, unwavering integrity, and powerful intelligence made Long Island a better place and will continue to be an inspiration. She will be deeply missed by all who had the joy and privilege of working with her. We offer our heartfelt condolences to her adored husband, Ranny, her children and grandchildren, all of whom gave her such pleasure.
