        HICKS-Henderson. The Board of Governors, staff, members and friends of Pathways for Youth mourn the passing of our beloved Board President. A committed volunteer for many human service organizations, Mr. Hicks sat on our Board for 15 years, serving as Treasurer and First Vice President before becoming the agency's first African-American President in 1995. We will remember Mr. Hicks as impassioned advocate, consummate diplomat and compassionate gentleman, tirelessly supporting our mission of youth development. Empowered by Mr. Hicks's determined leadership, Pathways more than doubled in size, scope of services and membership during his tenure as President. We extend heartfelt condolences to the Hicks family and immeasurable gratitude for the wisdom, perspective, spirit and energy he shared so gracefully with us and all people in need of meaningful assistance. Hank, you will truly be missed. The wake and funeral will be held at J. Foster Philips Funeral Home, 179-24 Linden Boulevard, Queens. The wake will be Wednesday January 17 from 4-8PM, program at 6:30PM. The funeral will be Thursday, January 18 at 10AM. The Pathways for Youth Family
