        MEYERS-Samuel. Died peacefully on December 15, 2001, at the age of 83. A fearless trade union organizer, a skillful union president, committed to the struggle for economic and racial justice. For 37 years, as president of UAW Local 259, he championed progressive social unionism, not only gaining decent wages, working conditions and benefits for members, but also supporting progressive causes in the communities where members live. He accomplished at his death what he practiced in life-preserving dignity, promoting unity and loving-kindness. Sam is survived by Carolyn Meyers, the love of his life and wife of 60 years; sons, Matthew and Daniel; daughter-in-law, Joan Max Reinmuth, five grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. A spring memorial is planned. In lieu of flowers, remembrances may be sent to the Sam Meyers Scholarship Fund, C/O Local 259 UAW, 113 University Place, NYC 10003.
