        LEVINE-Laurence W. The directors and staff of the Davis Mutual Funds mourn the sudden and untimely passing of their dear friend and esteemed director for 32 years. He had a distinguished career as a lawyer and diplomat. He was also a wise, and generous of time, counselor to us, our many thousands of shareholders, and our employees, and we shall miss him dearly. Our deepest condolences to his family.
