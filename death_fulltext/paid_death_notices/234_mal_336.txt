        $(6$)HIRSCH--Barry. The Board of Directors, Officers and employees of Loews deeply mourn the loss of Barry Hirsch, who served as General Counsel of the Corporation for 31 Years until his retirement in 2002. He was a cherished friend and colleague who provided unfailingly wise counsel and insightful advise which contributed significantly to the growth and success of Loews. His personal warmth and remarkable sense of humor were hallmarks of his business style, and his keen legal advice was greatly valued. In his all too brief retirement, he remained a great personal friend and corporate citizen. He will be greatly missed. We extend our deepest condolences to his children, Nancy, Neil, Victor and daughter-inlaw Ravit, his granddaughter, Shira Myra, and his entire family.

To his family and loved ones we express our profound sympathy. May beautiful memories bring comfort to those who mourn his passing. Rabbi David M. Posner Marcia Waxman, Pres. George Asch, Sec'y
