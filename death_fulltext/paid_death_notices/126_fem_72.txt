        FEINBERG-Etta Fischbach, 91, on July 8, 1997. Beloved wife of Bernard, mother of Nina, grandmother of Jessica and Sophie. A dedicated pianist and teacher, one of the first graduates of the Juilliard School of Music, she studied under Bessie Clay, Alexander Lambert and Carl Friedberg, continuing a tradition that extended back to Franz Liszt and Johannes Brahms. We will miss her fighting spirit & her love of life and music which lives on in her daughter and granddaughters. Requiescat.
