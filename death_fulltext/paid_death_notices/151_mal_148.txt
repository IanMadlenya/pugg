        EPSTEIN-Harry. Of Lawrence, Long Island, on August 13, 1999. Beloved husband of the late Clara Epstein, devoted father of Leonard and Edward, adoring father-inlaw to Karen & Jeanne, and loving grandfather to Samantha, Allison, Alanna, Dana, Lindsey, Jamie, Alanna's husband Jamie Levine and his loving sister Gertrude Macklin. He was the sole of decency, gentility, responsiblity and devotion. He inspired all who were in his orbit to be kinder and more caring. We will miss him greatly but honor his memory by trying to emulate his character.
