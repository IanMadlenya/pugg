        VIDAL - ORRANTIA -- Mirta. Age 55. On January 3, 2004. Born in Bueno Aires, Argentina, Mirta emigrated with her family to the U.S. at the age of 10, but always retained ties to her native land, traveling frequently throughout Latin America. She worked as a Spanish-language journalist and activist in the Socialist Workers Party, and in 1981, became one of the first generation of U.S. certified court interpreters. After serving as the first permanent staff interpreter in the U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, she worked as a freelance court and conference interpreter, and again, a brief time on staff in the Southern District. She served two terms as President of the National Association of Judiciary Interpreters and Translators, proving a fierce champion of professional interpreting standards in the creation of the NAJIT/ SSTI Certification Examination launched in 2002. She leaves behind her husband, Dagoberto, her parents Olga and George and her sisters, Graciela and Jeannine, who mourn her untimely passing. A memorial service will take place at Cobble Hill Chapels, 171 Court St., Bklyn on Friday, January 9th, 2:30PM. In lieu of flowers, donations to the Scleroderma Foundation are appreciated.
