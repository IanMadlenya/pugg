        ROSENTHAL-Norman, Dr. For the past 50 years, he was the Great Neck, N.Y., physician and healer in the grand tradition of medicine. His passing is like the extinguishing of a bright light-so brilliant was his personality, and so incisive was his medical judgment. We, among his closest friends and associates, were charmed by his dashing wit and touched by his loyalty to friends and patients alike.
