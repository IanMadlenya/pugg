        FERMAN-Robert. A wonderful man of wisdom, courage and love, adored by his wife, Bernice, his children, Pam and Seth, and the rest of his family, including Miriam, Selma, Harold, and so many other family and friends. Everyone who knew Bob loved him. He was genuine, caring and passionate about everything-his family, his friends, his work, his life. People where drawn to Bob, and often surprised by his intense interest in their lives, whether he knew them for seven seconds or seven decades. Class, religion, race, were just words to him when it came to people. Each person was moved by him, impressed by him, and better for having met him. He grew up poor, during the depression, but crafted a life built on integrity, commitment and kindness. He loved his work, from his little theater in The Bronx to successful, multi-theater company. He was respected both for his great success in business and his high moral ethic. Above all, he lived for and devoted his energies to his family. He took care of everybody. In the last ten years, he and Bernice proved to be an even greater inspiration to those around them, facing an increasingly debilitating illness with courage and grace. They both remained optomistic during the worst of times. His strength, her devotion, their love, went beyond our imagining. You always wanted us to be happy, and we will try. But in this moment, and every moment hereafter, we will miss you desperately. Services will be 12:30 PM Sunday at ''Riverside Memorial Chapel'', 76th Street and Amsterdam Ave, NY
