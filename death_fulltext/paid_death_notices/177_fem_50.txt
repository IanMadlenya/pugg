        ROSENBERG - Lenore Nathan Block. Of Buffalo NY, died peacefully September 27, 2001, in her ninetieth year. She is deeply mourned by her son, the writer Lawrence Block of New York City; her stepsons, Richard Rosenberg of Laguna Beach and Arthur Rosenberg of Albuquerque; her daughters-in-law, Lynne Block, Karen Rosenberg, and Loretta Mackay; her grandchildren, Amy Reichel, Jill Block, Alison Pouliot, Gretchen Faber, Diane Sweeney, Kenneth Rosenberg, David Poohina, and Jennifer Reyes; her greatgrandchildren, Sara and Marisa Reichel, Joseph Harrison, and Laura Rosenberg; and her brother and sister-in-law, Hi and Mim Nathan. She was predeceased by her two husbands, Arthur Jerome Block and Joseph Rosenberg; her daughter, Betsy Molina; and her brother, Jerry Nathan. A Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Cornell University, an accomplished painter, a woman of infinite warmth and wit, she's gone where the Saturday Review still publishes a Literary Cryptogram every week, and where there's an endless supply of unworked Double-Crostics; where Rubinstein and Horowitz and Art Tatum take turns at the piano, and where her favorite cities of New York and Paris and London are just around the corner. She was a great and gallant lady, and her absence leaves an enormous permanent gap in the skyline.
