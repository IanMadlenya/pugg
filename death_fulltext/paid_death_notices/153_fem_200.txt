        GLUCK-Ruth Rubin. Cherished wife of Marshall. Loving mother of Abbe and Simon. Adored daughter of Anna and the late Moses Rubin. Beloved sister of Judy Rubin. Dear daughter-in-law of Gertrude and Milton Shapiro. Admired sister-in-law of Bill, Richard and Melissa Gluck and Garth Hayden. In her too-short time with us she amazed us all with her ability to achieve so much while remaining completely devoted to her family. She was an accomplished corporate attorney at Metropolitan Life for 30 years, a perpetual student of Judaism and the arts, and the best wife and mother a family could hope for. Her intelligence, grace and beauty marked every aspect of her life and made her one of those few special people among us. She will be loved and with us always. Service at Park Avenue Synagogue, 87th Street and Madison Ave., Monday, October 25, at 10:30 AM. In lieu of flowers, contributions to the Advanced Research Foundation, 449 E. 68th St., Ste 2, NY NY 10021.
