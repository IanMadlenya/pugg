        FREIBERG-Sylvia. Died suddenly in Newton, MA., on October 20, 1998, less than three years after the death of Sam, her beloved husband of sixty-one years. Loving mother of Peter and Eileen. Caring mother-in-law of Joe Tom and Barney. Devoted grandmother of Solana and Sabrina. Born in Russia eighty-seven years ago, Sylvia grew up in Williamsburg, Brooklyn and lived most of her life in the Bronx. Short, smart, savvy and very funny, she was a woman who kowtowed to no one, even in pre-feminist times. Her abiding interest in people and politics made her a lively companion and was probably the reason she seemed so much younger than her years. While second to none in her love a good (or bad) joke, and a good (or bad) mah jongg game, her serious side was never far away: She continued to wish for political and economic justice for all people. Her family and friends will miss her, but she would be the first to say, ''I had a good run.''
