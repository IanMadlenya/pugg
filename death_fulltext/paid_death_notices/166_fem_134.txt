        STEIN-Anne Youle. Columbia University Health Sciences has lost a great friend. Anne Youle Stein, age 101, died at New YorkPresbyterian Hospital on November 17, 2000. Mrs. Stein, a philanthropist had an avid interest in helping to advance health care which perpetuated a close relationship with many members of the Columbia medical faculty. She became a major benefactress for the Department of Orthopedic Surgery where she named a floor which houses administrative, research and library space and funded the establishment of an endowed professorship. She also provided the Department of Medicine with an endowed teaching fund. Her kindness and support will keep her memory fresh in our hearts for many years to come.
