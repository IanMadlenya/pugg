        CINER--Fay G. It is with profound sorrow that we record the parting of our cherished mother, grandmother, greatgrandmother, sister, and aunt who passed away peacefully with her family by her side Sunday evening. Fay valued ''learning for learning's sake'' and her wisdom touched the lives of all who knew her. May we be privileged to carry on her precious legacy.
