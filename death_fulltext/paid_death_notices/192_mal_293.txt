        ANDREASSI - Calvin W. Founder of Sandy Lane Partners, a private hedge fund, and owner of CAC MedTech Group, a biotech/healthcare research consulting firm, died on Tuesday, January 21, 2003, at Northern Westchester Hospital. Survived by his beloved wife, Stephanie, mother, Ida; brother, James; sister, Sandra. Cal was born in Bronx, NY, on July 3, 1954. He earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts from New York University and worked as a professional musician for many years. Cal was one of the first dialysis patients in New York City, surviving 22 years on dialysis. In December 1999, he received a kidney transplant from his brother, James, and survived an additional three years during which he expanded his consulting business and hedge fund. Cal was well respected for his unique understanding of the FDA approval process and experimental methodologies for new drugs, as well as an uncanny ability to predict success or failure of a company and its products. Cal loved life and possessed an indomitable spirit which was contagious to all around him. He provided an unforgettable example of stoicism and great courage, and continually exceeded all expectations, achieving so much in such a short time. He will be missed by all who knew him. ''It's all so meaningless we might as well be extraordinary.'' For information Cassidy-Flynn Funeral Home, Inc 914-666-4840
