        ARNOLD-Ned. Of Lake Success, NY. The Board of Trustees and staff of New York Hospital Queens join his family in mourning the loss of Ned Arnold. Appointed an honorary member of the Board in 1989 and a Life Trustee in 1992, Ned was a major benefactor of the hospital and had a clear vision of this institution's role in maintaining the health of the people of Queens. Through his generous donation in 1995, The Julia and Ned R. Arnold Center for Radiation Oncology was established. Today, that facility and the other components of the Cancer Center treat more Queens patients than any other institution. Businessman, philanthropist, and community leader, Ned's influence was felt beyond the Queens community in the State House and in the White House, where he served as a member of President Eisenhower's Conference on Highway Safety. He will be remembered always for his commitment and dedication to New York Hospital Queens and the people it serves. Stephen S. Mills, President and Chief Executive Officer George F. Heinrich, M.D., Chairman, Board of Trustees
