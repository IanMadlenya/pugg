        LIEBOW--Gina. The officers and members of QUEST are saddened by Gina's passing on February 3, at age 92. Gina was a primary force in the creation of QUEST as a vital community for learning in retirement. Over the past 10 years we have benefitted from the brilliance of her extraordinary mind and the wide range of her interests. The energy that she brought to our development as a group remains at the core of our activities. A memorial meeting will be held on Wednesday, March 9, at 1 PM at QUEST, 99 Hudson Street. (212-925-6625 X229).
