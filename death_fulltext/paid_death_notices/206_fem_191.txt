        GERSTLE--Andrea D. The Board of 336 Central Park West mourn the loss of Andrea as a neighbor and friend. As a member of the Board for over 10 years and President for the last 3 years, Andrea was extremely generous of herself in these roles. The entire building, residents and staff will feel her loss. We will miss her and offer our condolences to her husband Mark Gerstle and her children, Cara and Morgan.
