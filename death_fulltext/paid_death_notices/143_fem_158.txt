Beloved wife to Bernd Allen; loving sister of Esther Natter, Irving Natter, Elaine Yates and Seymour Yates; adoring mother to Marissa Allen, Brian Lichtenstein, and Floella Allen; incredulous grandmother to Jamie; and ''Auntie Mame'' to nephews and nieces Mitchell, Douglass, Betsy, Peter, Martha, Eric, Cynthia (Heather). An attorney and linchpin of the real estate community, she always strove to achieve the impossible. Her spirit and panache will be missed.
