        BOWEN-Louis W., March 22, 2002. Businessman, interior designer, long associated with the Winter Antiques Show. Born in Los Angeles in 1914, he attended UCLA until 1936 when he was hired by Dorothy Hammerstein as her interior design assistant. When Mrs. Hammerstein reopened her business in NYC in 1939, he came to New York as her partner. A World War II Navy veteran, trained as a medical assistant, he was always pleased that his ward was chosen to be shown to Eleanor Roosevelt when she visited wounded servicemen in the South Pacific. He returned from active duty to open his own business, Louis W. Bowen, Inc., to manufacture specialty wall coverings. He operated this business for 40 years while continuing to create interior designs for many clients. He served as Chair of The Winter Antiques Show in 1970-71 and 1976; as co-chair, in 1995; and as a Board member of East Side House Settlement, the Show's beneficiary, since 1968. Active and acutely witty until his death at home, he was beloved by his many friends. There are no surviving family members. Funeral arrangements are private. A memorial service will be held at The Unitarian Church of All Souls, 1157 Lexington Ave., Wednesday, April 17, 2002 at 4 P.M.
