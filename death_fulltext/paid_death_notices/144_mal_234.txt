        COHEN-Henry. With his passing on January 14, 1999, New York City lost a dedicated public servant and policy expert and New School University a passionate and creative educational leader. Henry Cohen served New York City from 1950 to 1968, blazing a path that opened the City's government to increasing numbers of highly-trained professionals. As Professor of Urban Affairs and Dean of the Graduate School of Management and Urban Professions from 1968 to 1982, he conceived new curricula and the concept of urban professionals and recruited a distinguished faculty to train the new urban leadership. The Board of Advisors to the Robert J. Milano Graduate School of Mangement and Urban Policy of New School University express their grief and deep sympathy to his wife Evelyn, daughter Alison, son Daniel and grandchildren Anna and Rosalie. There will be a funeral Friday, January 15th at 12:15 at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76 Street, NYC. Bill Green, Chair Board of Advisors to the Robert J. Milano Graduate School Jonathan F. Fanton President, New School University
