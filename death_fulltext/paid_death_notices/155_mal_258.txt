        TAPLEY-Donald F., M.D. The Irving Center for Clinical Research of the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, together with Herbert and Florence Irving, wish to express their great sorrow at the loss of their leader. Dr. Tapley's vision, together with the gracious philanthropy of the Irvings, provided Columbia with the outstanding center for the conduct of patient-oriented research in the country. Dr. Tapley's leadership of our General Clinical Research Center grant from the National Institutes of Health ensured that we would combine the highest level of scientific inquiry and the best patient care. His guidance, wisdom and friendship will be greatly missed. Henry N. Ginsberg, M.D., Director, Irving Center for Clinical Research Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center
