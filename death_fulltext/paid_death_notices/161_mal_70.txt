        PUENTE-Tito. The Board of Directors and staff of Casita Maria, Inc. extend our heartfelt sympathy to the family and friends of Ernestito Anthony Puente Jr. We are proud to remember Tito as an alumnus of our after school program in East Harlem and recipient of the 1992 Casita Maria Gold Medal. We will never forget ''The King'' and will always be inspired by his life's work.
