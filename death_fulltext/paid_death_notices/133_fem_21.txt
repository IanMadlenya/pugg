        LEDER-Greta (nee Lustbader). Widow of Marcel and of Dr. Adolph Weissmann. February 1 after a short illness at age 92. After escaping from Nazi Austria with her family in 1938, she arrived in the United States and promptly helped her husband establish his medical practice in Manhattan. Her first marriage of almost thirty years was cut short by Adolph's death in 1958, followed by a second marriage to Marcel Leder, a retired merchant with whom she lived in New York and Palm Beach, Florida. She is survived and will be fondly remembered by brothers, Herbert Lustbader and Curtis Lane; her son, Dr. Gerald Weissmann of New York; her grandchildren, Dr. Lisa Beth Weissmann of Watertown, MA., and Andrew Weissmann, Esq. of New York; and great-grandson, Benjamin, of Watertown, MA.
