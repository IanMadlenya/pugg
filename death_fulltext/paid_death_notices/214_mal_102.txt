        BERNARDS--Rabbi Solomon. The Rabbinical Assembly mourns with profound sorrow the passing of our beloved colleague who served as Director of Interreligious Affairs for the ADL until retirement. We extend our deepest condolences to his family and to all who were touched through his rabbinate.
