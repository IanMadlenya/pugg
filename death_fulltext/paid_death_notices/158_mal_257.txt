        KING-Rusty. For dear Rusty, whose friendship these last 28 years meant so much. You taught me about being a better person, a better friend, and a better doctor. My world will be a lesser place without you in it. The whole office sends deepest condolences to his Mom, Mary Ann, devoted sisters, Leslie and Kit, and his many dear friends, especially Anne.
