        FOLLANSBEE-Ann G. The children, families, staff and Board of Trustees of The League Treatment Center mourn the death, on July 27, 1997, of our beloved friend and colleague Ann G. Follansbee. A brilliant clinician, Ann was our Director of Psychology for over 15 years. She was passionately devoted to the healthy development of our children. Ann saw the best in each child and was a friend to each of us. She leaves a legacy of love and inspiration. Our condolences to her devoted family and friends. A memorial service will be held 4PM Sunday, August 17, 1997 at the Church of the Good Shepherd, 236 E. 31 St, New York City. In lieu of flowers, charitable contributions may be made to the Psychomotor Institute Inc., 60 Western Avenue, Cambridge, MA. 02139, for many years a focus of Ann's personal concern.
