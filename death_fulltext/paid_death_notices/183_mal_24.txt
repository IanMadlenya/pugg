        SZABAD-George M. The American Jewish Committee mourns the loss of George Szabad, an Honorary Vice President and one of our most active and dedicated leaders for more than half a century. George's leadership and intense involvement, inspired by a profound ethical sensibility and abiding social conscience, has helped to shape AJC in countless ways. Always seeking to build human bridges of understanding and mutual respect, George, born and raised in Warsaw, Poland, was a Founding Member and Co-Chairman of the National Polish-American/Jewish - American Council, jointly sponsored by AJC and Polish-American leaders. His love affair with America's pluralistic experiment was matched only by his devotion for his fellow Jews and all people everywhere. His efforts at AJC over so many years were buoyed through his partnership with his late wife Shirley, also a committed AJC leader, whose work is memorialized by the Shirley Szabad Annual Chapter Achievement Awards. We were proud to honor George with AJC's prestigious National Distinguished Leadership Award in 1999. We will sorely miss his friendship, warmth, optimism, zest for life and inspiring example of integrity and service. Our sense of loss is immeasurable. Our heartfelt condolences go out to his wife, Janet Fulton Szabad, his children Peter and Ellen, grandchildren and the rest of the grieving family. Harold Tanner, President David A. Harris, Exec Director E. Robert Goodkind, Chair, Board of Governors Shulamith Bahat, Assoc. Exec. Dir.
