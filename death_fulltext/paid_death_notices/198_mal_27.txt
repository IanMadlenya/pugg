        GITELSON--Paul, D.S.W. The Trustees and Staff of Jewish Childcare Association mourn the loss of Paul Gitelson, who as Chief Executive Officer of JCCA from 1992 to the present, led the agency through a decade of vast changes in practice and attitudes towards children and families. Dr. Gitelson began at JCCA in 1982 as Training Director and during his eleven years at JCCA's helm, was responsible for the institution of familycentered practice, an agencywide approach to working with children in partnership with their families; an increased emphasis on independent living skills training; and accountability. He was active in the child welfare community, holding posts at C.W.L.A., C.O.F.C.C.A., H.S.C., A.A.C.R.C. and U.J.A.-Federation of New York. Paul was immensely devoted to his family and extraordinarily proud of their role in social welfare in New York City. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Aileen Gitelson, his children, Lisa and Michael and their families. Paul had a passion for social justice and a talent for connecting warmly with people; clients, trustees, colleagues and public officials benefited from his friendship and fine sense of humor. His contributions on behalf of children and families were significant. He will be missed. Barbara B. Mann, President Joyce L. Kramer, Board Chair Richard Altman, C.O.O.
