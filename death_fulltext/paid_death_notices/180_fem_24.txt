        KEMPNER-Margaret Loeb. The Board of Directors, Auxiliary and Administration of The New York Eye and Ear Infirmary mourn the passing of a dear friend and benefactor.

She was named an Honorary Director in May 1999 in commemoration of her 100th birthday. She made a special cause of improving the quality of care for children and their families and will long be remembered by those who were touched by her generosity and kindness. Our sincerest condolences to her family. Peter Frelinghuysen, Chairman of the Board Joseph P. Corcoran President and CEO
