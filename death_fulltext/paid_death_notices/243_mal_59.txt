        ANFANG--Edward. The Yeshiva University and Wurzweiler School of Social Work families mourn the loss of our longtime, generous Wurzweiler Board of Governors member, Edward Anfang. His belief in the power of education to improve Jewish Communal Service led to his establishing many important Wurzweiler programs, including the Anfang Jewish Communal Scholar-in-Residence Program and the Anfang Jewish Communal Scholarship Fund. We extend our sincerest condolences to his wife, Gloria, their children, and his entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel, President Norman Lamm, Chancellor Morry Weiss, Chairman Board of Trustees Robert Schwalbe, Chairman Wurzweiler School of Social Work Board of Governors Sheldon R. Gelman David I. and Dorothy Schachne Dean Wurzweiler School of Social Work
