        WEYL-Liselotte. The Institute For Psychoanalytic Training And Research (IPTAR) mourns the loss of our esteemed colleague Liselotte Weyl. Liselotte was the widow of Dr. Simon Weyl, and escaped from Holland during the second World War. She studied in England with Edward Glover and Anna Freud. After coming to this country, Liselotte became a member of IPTAR, organized our library, and was our first librarian. We are all saddened by her death. Allan Frosch, President
