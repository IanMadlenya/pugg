        MURRAY--A. Brean, 66. The Board of Trustees of the John Jay College Foundation, Inc., mourns the loss of our dear fellow Trustee, Brean Murray. Brean's sudden demise leaves us shocked, uncomprehending, and deeply saddened. Brean generously and enthusiastically supported John Jay College through its Foundation. He also munificently and continually supported the Jerry McCabe Exchange between the Irish Police (An Garda Siochana) and John Jay College and American law enforcement. His vitality, openness, generosity, acumen and kindness was a continuing joy to Brean's friends at John Jay College and in Irish and American law enforcement communities. With our love and devotion to his wife, Bettina, and Brean's family, we express our heartfelt condolences and sincerest sympathy. Requiescat in pace.
