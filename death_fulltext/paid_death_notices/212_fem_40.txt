        TIERNEY--Loren. We mourn the loss of our courageous, dearest colleague, our former exceptional student, resident and chief resident, Loren Tierney. She was an outstanding member of our staff at Bellevue and NYU (Tisch Hospital). Her competence was beyond compare. She was loved, admired and respected by all of us. She was a most competent and popular teacher, mentor and clinician. Her students, fellow house officers, our faculty and her patients will always remember her effective demeanor. She was a scholar who was a wonderful, unusual person. We lost one of our very best. We express our deep sympathy to her husband, children and family. Saul J.
