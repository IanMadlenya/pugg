        ESTRIN-Harvey. On September 21, 2002, after a sixmonth struggle with complications from surgery. Beloved wife of Trudy Kane; loving father of Glen, Mitchell and Nancy; dear brother of Morton; devoted grandfather of William. One of New York City's most respected studio musicians, he can be heard on countless jingles, recordings and films. In the '50's he played with name bands, including Tommy Dorsey and Sauter-Finegan. He lead a studio orchestra at the 92nd Street Y for many years, playing primarily the music of Sauter-Finegan. Two concertos were written for and recorded by him, one by Harold Farberman and the other by Irwin Bazelon. He appeared as soloist with the New York Philharmonic, performing the Bazelon Concerto. The New York Times called him ''a talented multiinstrumentalist,'' as the Bazelon showcased his versatility on many instruments. Harvey Estrin loved life and enjoyed it to the fullest. Services 11:45 AM, Monday, September 23, at ''The Riverside,'' Amsterdam Ave at 76th St.
