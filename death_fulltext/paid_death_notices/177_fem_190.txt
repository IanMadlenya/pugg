        TURBERG-Dr. Jessie, died on Wednesday, October 17, 2001, in Glen Cove. She was in her mid 80's. She was married to the late William Cohen. She is survived by her daughter, Nina Cohen-Ryan, her son-in-law, Philip D. Ryan, and her three grandchildren, Rebecca, Sean and Ben. Born in the time when opportunities for women were few, Jessie created the world she envisioned. Structural barriers did not limit her. With New York City as the fuel behind her soul, she achieved enormous success and changed the course of people's lives, over and over again. She was a champion of the family and worked tirelessly to better relationships for families. She did this as a professor at NYU, as a teacher and supervisor at the Ackerman Family Institute, and as a private clinician. She measured who she was by what she gave to others. Jessie was the kind of woman who loved silk and elegance and intellectualism, hard work and cherished creativity. She was the greatest fan for those she loved and when speaking of her family, she would say that her heart ''burst with pride.'' Today we honor her and our hearts burst with pride for all the memories, for all the moments and for all the love that her life brought into everything she touched. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made in her name to the American Cancer Society.
