        LOVE--Freeman D. The Trustees, faculty, students and staff of Poly Prep Country Day School mourn the passing of Freeman D. Love, beloved alumnus, class of 1933, and Trustee Emeritus. Throughout his life, he embodied the essential spirit of Poly--where character supersedes all else. We are deeply saddened and extend our condolences to his wife, Andree Walton, his children Francis, Peter, Georgette and Patsey, and his five grandchildren. Donald Carswell, Chairman David Harman, Headmaster Poly Prep Country Day School, Brooklyn, N.Y.
