        SOMMER-Bonnie. September 10, 1997. Born March 1, 1948. Bonnie died after a valiant battle with lung cancer. She was the daughter of the late Smitty Sommer and his survived by her mother Esther, her sister Elissa and the joy of her life, her son Michael. Bonnie was a graduate of the Cooper Union. She devoted many years teaching children born with neurological problems, but she never lost her interest in the arts. She was a devoted mother, always trying to do her best for her beloved son Michael. She is survived by many friends and relatives and she will be sadly missed for her smile, her wit and her laughter. She also was the very best of sisters and will be missed more than mere words could possibly express. The funeral will be held Friday at 12:30PM at I.J. Morris, Flatbush and Kings Highway. In lieu of flowers donations in her memory to the Mary McDowell Center for Learning, 110 Schermerhorn Street, Brooklyn, New York, would be greatly appreciated.
