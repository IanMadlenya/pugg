        POPICK--Morris. A great many members of the staff of GVA Williams were lucky enough to have spent many decades in association with Morris Popick. Morris was generous, caring, considerate, honorable, warm and friendly and on top of that very knowledgeable. He could virtually name every tenant on every floor in every building in the areas of the city in which he was most active. Morris always went out of his way to be helpful to others for the more than forty years he was with us. We shall miss him. We extend our condolences to his family.
