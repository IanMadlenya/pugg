        FELDMAN-Vita. The Board of Directors of the Jack Martin Fund notes with deep sorrow the passing of its beloved co-founder, Vita Feldman. She and her late husband, Gus, were true pioneers, creating a model for regional charity work that is still emulated today. The modest but powerful force of her dedication, selflessness and humanity was a warm light that attracted hundreds of volunteers and has helped raise millions of dollars since the early '50's. We extend our sincere condolences to her family, and we can think of no better way to honor her memory than to continue the work that she began.
        FELDMAN-Vita. We are deeply saddened at the passing of our dear friend Vita, a compassionate and caring person, whom we loved and respected. We will miss her elegance, nobility and grace. The Newman family extends our deepest sympathy to Sandy, Alan and Jack and her entire family. Gertrude, Charles, Stephanie, Jay, Rochelle and Bruce
