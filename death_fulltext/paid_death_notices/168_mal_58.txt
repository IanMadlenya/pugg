It is with a sense of great loss that we note the passing of a friend, a fellow bookman, a lover of American Art, and, above all an ever witty, cheerful, and warm human being. We join all those who extend their sympathy to his bereft widow and family. Craig Anderson, Fred Bass, Jeff Gmelch, Richard Lily, Marvin Mondlin for the entire staff of Strand Book Store
