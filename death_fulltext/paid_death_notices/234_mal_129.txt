        WATROUS - Philip. The Board of Directors and staff of Jericho Project mourn the passing of our friend and mentor Phil Watrous, a Founding Director of Jericho since 1983. Phil always showed compassion for those less fortunate, modestly likening himself to a leaky pail watering the plants along the road. His guidance helped Jericho Project navigate safely through difficult times in the early days. Phil will forever remain an inspiration for his continued service to others and good humor throughout his 12 - year struggle with ALS. Our love goes out to his wife, Linda, and his family
