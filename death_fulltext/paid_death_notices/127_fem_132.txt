        NUSSBAUM-Bertha. We mourn the passing of Mrs. Bertha Nussbaum, beloved sister of Mrs. Lotte Bachrach, who together with her late husband, Ludwig, are Founders of the ''Hospital with a Heart''. Thanks to her generosity we can provide the people of Jerusalem and Israel with compassionate medical care, heal the sick and ease the pain of the afflicted. May the family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
