        LIEBOWITZ-Simon J. We record with sorrow the passing, at age 92, of our distinguished Vice President whose guidance and counsel for a quarter of a century contributed substantially to keeping the New York Cardiac Center as one of the best medical research institutions. He brought to our organization those same high standards which marked his career as a Senator in the New York State Legislature, a Civil Court Judge, and as a Justice of the State Supreme Court. If no person stands more erect than when stooping to help others, he will remain forever tall in our memory. George Barasch, President
