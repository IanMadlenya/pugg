        WILDENSTEIN - Daniel. The Board and staff of the French Institute Alliance Francaise extend their deepest sympathy to the family of Daniel Wildenstein. Often behind the scenes, the Wildenstein family has played a crucial role in advancing French - American friendship and French culture throughout the United States. Indeed, their unselfish leadership gave light to many major presentations and projects of the French Institute Alliance Francaise without any wish for recognition. We are saddened by the loss of this soft-spoken man and pay tribute to the contributions he has made to the world of art and culture in his lifetime. Our heartfelt condolences to his son, Guy, an outstanding member of our Board, his brother, Alec, and the entire Wildenstein family. John H.F. Haskell, Jr., President Board of Trustees David S. Black, Executive Director
