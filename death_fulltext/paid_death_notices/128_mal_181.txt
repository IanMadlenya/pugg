        SURBECK-L. Homer. A retired litigation partner in Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP, died on September 5th, at his home in Atherton, California. He was 94. Mr. Surbeck was born October 8, 1902, in Jasper, Minnesota. He graduated first in his class from Yale Law School in 1927 and was selected to be Supreme Court Chief Justice William Howard Taft's law clerk. Two years later he became an associate of Hughes, Schurman & Dwight, where he researched law for future Supreme Court Chief Justice Charles Evan Hughes. Surbeck became a partner in the firm in 1934 and, in 1937, a founding partner in the firm that would become Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP. Mr. Surbeck established a reputation as a master of developing legal theories. Among his highprofile clients were Alcoa, Ford Motor Company and Merck & Company. ''Homer was always a lawyer's lawyer,'' commented Robert J. Sisk, Hughes Hubbard's Chairman. ''Whenever a partner needed a workable legal theory to sustain a client's position, he or she would usually turn to Homer. All of us who had the privilege of working with Homer will miss him greatly.'' Dedicated to motivating students to better their lives, Mr. Surbeck gave close to 1,000 scholarships to those seeking higher education in many schools. His ''Success on the Job'' address was read into the Congressional Record in 1957. He was also the author of ''The Success Formula That Really Works'' (1986), now in its seventh printing. In 1963 South Dakota School of Mines, Homer's alma mater, named its new student center the ''Surbeck Center.'' In recent years Mr. Surbeck wrote and lectured on the topic of how to apply religious principles to daily living and was active in Dr. Norman Vincent Peale's Foundation for Christian Living. He was a recipient of the Yale Medal and the Horatio Alger Award. Surbeck is survived by his wife, Margaret.
