        LUBITZ - Sylvia, passed peacefully early Tuesday morning at home in Palm Beach, with her husband and daughter holding her hands. If you knew her, then you know how sad a passing this is, but you also know that it is not a tragic passing. Sylvia led a life so full of glamour and pleasure, full of humor and style, full of the love of her devoted husband and family and friends, a full life of joy and caring. She lived the life she wanted to live, uncompromisingly, with zest and vigor and passion and culture and love. Instantly and completely loved by friends, she is survived by husband Lewis Lubitz, daughter Sara Richter, son-in-law Morton Richter, grandchildren Matthew, Daniel and Ann Marie, and David. For information: Quattlebaum Funeral Home, (561)-832-5171.
