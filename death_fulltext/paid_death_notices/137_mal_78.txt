        KRONENBERG - Bernard, M.D. The officers, board and staff of the Jewish Braille Institute of America offer profound sympathy to his beloved family and also to all those whose lives were so enriched by the extraordinary medical skills and deeply sensitive personality throughout his decades of service. The visually impaired served today by the JBI throughout the United States, Israel and in many other countries are beneficiaries of Dr. Kronenberg's having been the pioneer who first added to our agency's program large print and other additional services for them. Thus, we opened the doors of Judaic heritage to thousands more of all ages. His memory endures for lasting blessing and inspiration.
        KRONENBERG - Bernard, M.D. The Board of Governors and members of Beech Point Club note with deep sorrow the passing of our fellow member, Bernard Kronenberg and extend sincerest condolences to his family. Roy R. Raizen, President
