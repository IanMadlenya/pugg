        POTTER--Ted. Perhaps the strongest proponent in the Southeast for contemporary art for the last half of the 20th century died at his home in Richmond, VA on Thursday night after a yearlong battle with cancer. A Tribute to Ted Potter will be held November 11 at 2 pm at the Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art (SECCA) in Winston-Salem, NC. Potter, associate professor at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), was the most vocal champion for artist free speech during the 1980's and 1990's when public funding for the arts was being challenged by conservatives. Potter is most closely identified with SECCA where he was its director from 1967 -1991. While at SECCA, Potter started two awards programs, the 13 state Southeast Seven and the National Awards in the Visual Arts. Born in 1932 in Springhill, KS, he earned a BFA at Baker University and a MFA at the California College of Arts and Crafts. Potter was director of Anderson Gallery at VCU and of art centers in New Orleans, Florida and San Francisco. A retrospective of his paintings was held at SECCA this year. Potter is survived by his wife, Laura, and their twin daughter, Kenan Casteen and Sarah Bethania, of the home.
