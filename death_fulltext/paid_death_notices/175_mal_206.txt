        TILLIM-Sidney. A superbly gifted artist with a uniquely American vision. He painted scenes depicting figures from The American Revolution, paintings not applauded by the art scene then or now. My respect for his courage, and artistic integrity has grown over 47 years. His last exhibit of paintings, showed a vision of art even more virile, more powerful, more hauntingly beautiful than ever. His subjects are iconic moments of recent history. ''The Death of Mrs. Silverman'' is clearly a masterpiece. I have lost a dear friend. My heart goes out to his loving wife and kin. Jules Olitski
