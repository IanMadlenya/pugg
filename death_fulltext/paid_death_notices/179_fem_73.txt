        HARMAN-Sylvia, 85 years. On December 8. Her devoted children Lynn, Barbara, Gina and Paul; their spouses; her loving grandchildren Megan, Rachel, Molly, Julia, Isabel, Grace and Jake, mourn their mom, mother-in-law, & nana. She was co-founder and former President of North Shore Child Guidance Center, world traveller and lover of the arts. She lived with courage, grace and dignity. Her long illness challenged, but never defined her. We were lucky to have her in our lives and proud of the way she lived hers. We loved her. She will be profoundly missed. Contributions to the Michael J. Fox Parkinson's Foundation may be made in her name. A celebration in her honor will be held at a later date.
