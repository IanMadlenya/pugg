        OSBORN-Millicent (Green), at age 92, on November 1, 1997, peacefully at home, amongst her family, as she wished. She joins her adored husband of over fifty years, the late playwright, Paul Osborn. Born in Poland, 1905, emigrated USA as a child, and in her teens won a scholarship to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, going on to be a featured actress both on Broadway and West End. After her marriage she wrote short fiction for numerous publications, among them The Saturday Evening Post and The New Yorker. Her glamour, her flair and her unique style remained, right to the end. She is survived by a brother, Jack Green of Palm Desert, California, a daughter, Judith Osborn MacGillivray, a granddaughter, Gabrielle Osborn Gidney, a son-inlaw, William Gidney, and five great grandchildren, Shannon, Chelsea, Keith, Satania and Daimon, all of NYC. The memorial gathering will be private. Condolences to the Osborn Family, at 1165 Park Avenue, New York City.
