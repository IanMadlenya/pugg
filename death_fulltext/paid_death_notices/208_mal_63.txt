        STAVIS--Frank. The officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Frank Stavis, beloved father of Robert Stavis and Patricia Dweck; father-in-law of Amy Stavis; cherished leaders of the New York Jewish community. We are privileged that Frank's legacy to the Jewish community continues through the abounding efforts of his children: Robert, a member of the Board of Directors of UJA-Federation and president elect of Westchester Jewish Community Services; and Patricia, a leader in the Scarsdale Women's Campaign. We extend our deepest sympathies to his beloved wife Reeva; to his children Robert and Amy; Patricia and Michael; Susan and Eric; to his grandchildren; and to the entire family. Larry Zicklin, President Morris W. Offit, Chair of the Board John S. Ruskay, Exec. V.P. & C.E.O.
