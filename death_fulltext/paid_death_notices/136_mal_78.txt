        TARAIL-Mark, D.S.W. We are deeply saddened at the passing of Mark Tarail, one of the founders of the Department of Psychiatry and the Community Mental Health Center at Maimonides. A dynamic leader and scholar, Mark always sought to speak for those who did not have a voice. He envisioned a world in which universal health care would become a reality, and he conveyed this dream to his students. We at Maimonides who worked with Mark and greatly admired him wish to express our deepest sympathy to his wife Helen, his brother Theodore, his children Judith and Michael, and to his seven grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. Martin Payson, Chairman Board of Trustees Stanley Brezenoff President and CEO, and the Staff of Maimonides Medical Center
