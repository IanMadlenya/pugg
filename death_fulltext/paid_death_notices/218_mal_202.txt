        HOLLANDER -- Charles S., M.D. The Department of Medicine and the Division of Endocrinology sadly announce the passing of Dr. Charles S. Hollander. He served as the chief of the Division of Endocrinology for 28 years. He was one of the leading investigators in clinical thyroid disease and was the first to measure the role of triiodothyronine in thyroid diseases. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to his family.
