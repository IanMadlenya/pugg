        BUND--Phyllis, 80. Her family remembers this spirited, intelligent, good woman and keeper of family tales, who sadly experienced a difficult last part of her life. She had so much to give and to share. She was a devoted daughter of her late parents Samuel and Beatrice Gottesman, a caring sister of Albert Gottesman, a loving aunt of Laura Gottesman and Joanne Gottesman (and briefly greataunt of Elena Gottesman Milliken) and an appreciative ''sister-in-law'' of Anne Baker and Linda Gottesman.
