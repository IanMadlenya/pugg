        O'CONNELL - Reverand Brian, C.M. St. John's University expresses its profound sorrow on the passing of Reverend Brian O'Connell, C.M., devoted servant of the Church. A dedicated dean and faculty member, and former trustee, he was a true friend of all who pursue spritual and intellectual enrichment so they may better serve God and their fellow man, especially the poor. His gentleness, humor, compentence and commitment to the highest standards of excellence have blessed us who were privileged to work with him. We are grateful to God for giving him to us and extend our deepest sympathy to the members of his family. Donald J. Harrington, C.M. President
