        LAI--William T. (Buck). Long Island University mourns the loss of one of its own, Buck Lai. As a student, faculty member, coach, administrator and benefactor, he enriched the University community for more than 66 years. We extend our deepest condolences to his family and to his beloved wife, Mary M. Lai, our Vice President for Finance and Treasurer. Together, they helped build the University as we know it today. His influence is deeply engrained in the very fabric of the institution. His spirit will live on through the many lives he touched. Roger Tilles Chair, Board of Trustees David J. Steinberg President
