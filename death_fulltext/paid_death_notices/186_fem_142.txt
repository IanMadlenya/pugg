        RAUCHER-Mary Kathryn. Beloved wife of Herman, adored mother of Jacqueline Leigh Salkin and Jennifer Brooke Raucher, revered grandmother of Samantha Raucher Salkin and Jamie Leigh Salkin, devoted mother-in-law of Will Salkin, left us on July 21, fighting her cancer to the final bell. A superlative dancer with an illustrious career, she charmed, provoked, amazed and dazzled all who came within her embracing perimeter. The first to answer the call of friends in trouble or disarray, ''M.K.'s'' compassion, wit and spirit was treasured by all who knew her. Her dance is ended but her radiance lingers on. Memorial service Thursday, August 1, 2002 from 3-5pm at the Field Club of Greenwich.
