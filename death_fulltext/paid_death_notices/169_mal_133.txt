        FOURNIER-Joseph E. MD. The Faculty and Staff of NYU Medical Center note with great sorrow the passing of our esteemed colleague and friend, Joseph E. Fournier. Dr. Fournier completed his residency in anesthesiology and a fellowship in cardiac anesthesia at NYU School of Medicine before joining the Department of Anesthesiology in 1998. He quickly became an essential part of the life of our institution and will be sorely missed. We extend our most heartfelt condolences to his family and loved ones. Robert M. Glickman, MD, Dean NYU School of Medicine Theresa A. Bischoff, President, NYU Hospitals Center Charles Fermon, MD, Chairman, Department of Anesthesiology
