        BORGIA-Betty. She was a special person who possessed sparkle, self-confidence, intelligence and compassion. Though a Nurse Practitioner by trade and choice, she wore many hats and all of them fit her to perfection. Her dedication and loyalty to her patients was part of her legacy. She was the epitome...the paragon of a healer. We will all miss her profoundly. The staff at Jacobi Medical Center
