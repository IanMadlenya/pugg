        FREUND - ROSENTHAL - Miriam K. The National Jewish Outreach Program mourns the passing of Dr. Miriam Freund-Rosenthal, mother of Harry and Matta Freund, devoted benefactors of NJOP, where Harry serves as a member of the Board of Directors. Dr. Freund-Rosenthal, a legendary Jewish leader, served with great vision and devotion as National President of Hadassah. Her family has followed in her footsteps, particularly her granddaughter, Rebecca who has served as an invaluable member of NJOP, both in a professional and volunteer capacity. May her memory be blessed. Rabbi Ephraim Z. Buchwald, Dir.
        FREUND - ROSENTHAL - Miriam, Dr. She was a close and special friend to our family. We will miss her dearly. Heartfelt sympathy to the whole Freund family. Love, Batyah Kahane and Family
