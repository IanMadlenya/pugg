        FRIEDHOFF-Arnold J., MD. The National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression (NARSAD) mourns the loss of our esteemed Scientific Council member, Chairman of the Lieber Prize Committee for Schizophrenia Research and devoted supporter. Dr. Friedhoff's pioneering leadership in the field of biological psychiatry led to his role as a founding member of our distinguished Scientific Council. His wise guidance and supportive energies were typified by the Nobel Prizes awarded to scientists previously honored by the Lieber Prize Committee under his leadership. He was truly one of the important guides and mentors in the remarkable development of brain and behavior research. His work was profoundly humanitarian in lifetime focus and achievement, enhancing the science, medical education and patient care. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Frances and his family. Herbert Pardes, M.D. President of the Scientific Council Constance E. Lieber President, Board of Directors
