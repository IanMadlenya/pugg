        MARKS-Howard. To our brotherin-law Jeffrey and our sister Jill, we extend our deepest condolences on the loss of Jeffrey's father, Howard Marks. We were privileged to know him and our lives were truly blessed by his kind heart, generous spirit and thoughtful insight. To Lorene, Michael, Yvonne, Jennifer, Kelly, Amy, Brian, Lynne, Madeline, and Aaron and to our nieces Melanie, Shelby and Julia please know that our thoughts are with you. Howard will live on through each of you forever and we hope that you will use this time to reflect on all the wonderful times you had at home in New York, on the mountains of Vermont and traveling the world together. It was a full and wonderful life and he loved you all. Jeffrey, Nancy, Andrew, Sam and Elizabeth Siskind, Stephen, Laura, Max and Cara Siskind
