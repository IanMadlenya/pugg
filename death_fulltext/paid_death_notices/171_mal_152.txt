        STERN-Mitchell. The Manhattan School of Music mourns the death of Mitchell Stern, a respected and longtime member of the violin faculty as well as frequent coach of chamber music. From 1980 to 1990, he was first violinist of the American String Quartet, artists in residence at the school since 1984. As a performer, teacher and friend, we shall sorely miss him. We extend our most heartfelt condolences to his family. David A. Rahm, Chairman, Board of Trustees Marta Istomin, President
