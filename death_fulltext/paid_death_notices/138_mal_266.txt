        PREY-Hermann. The Board, Artist Members and staff of The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center mourn the loss of Hermann Prey. In the first of many memorable appearances, Mr. Prey sang Schumann's ''Dichterliebe'' with Founding Artistic Director Charles Wadsworth at the inaugural concert of Alice Tully Hall and the Chamber Music Society in 1969. His singing gave to us all the gift of experiencing music at its most powerful and affecting. His artistry, humanity and irrepressible spirit touched many. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife Barbara and his family. Donaldson C. Pillsbury, Chairman Mrs. John D. Coffin, President David Shifrin, Artistic Director Jacqueline Taylor, Exec Director Charles Wadsworth, Founding Artistic Director
