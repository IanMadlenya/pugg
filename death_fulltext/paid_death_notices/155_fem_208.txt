        ROSS-Denise. With profound regret and heartwrenching sadness we mourn the passing of our dear friend and business associate, Denise Ross. Her passion, integrity, and sheer determination in everything she did was truly extraordinary. The courage and strength with which she battled her illness was tantamount to the love and energy she brought to everyone around her. Our sincerest condolences to her husband, Charles Ross, adored sons Jonathan and Zachary, and best daughter in the world to Pearl Donshik. We will deeply miss her.
