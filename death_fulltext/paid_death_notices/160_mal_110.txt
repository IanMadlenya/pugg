        SHORE-Josselyn M. By now you're up there sprinting with Charlie Paddock and out-driving in ''The Babe.'' In life as in golf, you were always a ''whole''-in-one, of whichever spelling. As you had done so eloquently on past family occasions, we toast you now: Here's to you, Joss. You will be forever in our hearts. Seth and Barbara, Mark and Sarah, Laura and Lynn Bartner
