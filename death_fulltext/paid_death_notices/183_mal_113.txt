        LEVY-Capt. Jerome E. The American Friends of The Hebrew University and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem mourn the passing of Captain Jerome E. Levy, USNR (Ret.). Captain Levy had a long, illustrious career in the US Navy, and his dedication to the United States Armed Services was matched by his devotion to Israel. Captain Levy established the Anna Sobol Levy Fellowship Program at The Hebrew University, enabling representatives of the American armed forces and foreign service to study at the Rothberg International School. His commitment to humanitarian causes and to higher education will long be remembered. We extend our deepest condolences to Captain Levy's family, colleagues, and friends.
