        KAMINSKY--Leon Lynch. A man of character and unmatched decency for 97 years, 67 of which he shared in love and devotion with his deceased but still-adored wife Bea. Cherished father of Gerry and Marty, father-in-law of Jackie and Nancy, grandfather of Gary, Jenny, Michael and Missy and their spouses, and his many great-grandchildren. Valued friend to many others, including the community at Lake Worth Gardens, his and Bea's extended family members and his children's friends. His smile and warmth will be sorely missed.
        KAMINSKY--Leon ''Lynch.'' He set the bar high, now back in the saddle with Bea. Grandfather of Gary, Michael, Lori, Marla, great grandfather of James, Tommy, Taylor, Katie, William, and Charlie. Visionary and patriarch of Team K.
