        CUNNION-Paul. We will miss our dear friend, whose devotion to his beloved wife, Muffin, was like songs on the radio about old fashioned romance. His warmth and humor, his kindness, dignity and heroism, made knowing him and loving him a joy. Our condolences to his family, to Bess and to Muffin, of whose steadfast courage and strength he can be proud. Blanche and Tom.
