        WECHSLER-Herbert. The Faculty and Staff of Columbia Law School deeply mourn the passing of its friend, graduate and longtime colleague Herbert Wechsler. One of the true giants of the modern era of law, his wisdom and genius changed for the better not only generations of Columbia Law school graduates, but indeed the profession of law itself. David W. Leebron, Dean Columbia Law School
