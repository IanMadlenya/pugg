        DELYNN-Alan. On January 12. He began his lifetime career in the theater and film business in 1951, when he worked as a production assistant on ''Shane'' on location in Wyoming. In the years that followed he participated in the production of over 40 plays and films including a professional relationship with David Merrick that began in the mid 60's and lasted more than a decade. Alan was an unusually astute judge of talent and material. He was an exceptional scholar of film history, able to recall entire scenes of dialogue and details of casting and production. He served on the Board of Directors of the Anthology Film Archive. He is survived by his sister, Mrs. Howard Richman of Pittsburgh, five nieces and nephews and nine grandnieces and grand nephews. Any donations in his memory can be made to the Anthology Film Archive, 32 Second Ave, New York City, New York 10003.
