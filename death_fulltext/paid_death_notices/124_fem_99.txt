        SERWER-BERNSTEIN-Blanche, ELEM/Youth in distress in Israel mourns the passing of Blanche Bernstein, founder and hard working board member and professional of ELEM. Blanche's love of Israel and children showed in her persistent work at ELEM. She helped found our successful program for many Israeli families and children. Her alert mind remained during her long, courageous struggle against dying. Her love of life was conveyed by her many efforts up to her passing to bring peace and well being to troubled families in both Israel and America. Our heartfelt sympathy goes to her brother Sydney, and all her devoted children and grandchildren.
