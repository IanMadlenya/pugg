        ISRAEL--Jinni Y., 1972 to 2007, passed away unexpectedly. She was the treasure of the lives of her father and mother, Henry and Davee, and of her brothers Robert and David, and sister-in-law Dawn. She was a delicate flower whose end came too soon. She was wonderfully accomplished in so many areas as a pianist, computer whiz and writer. Her untimely death has brought great sorrow to all her family and friends, but she will be with us forever. Memorial service Sunday, March 18th at 12PM, at the Racket and Tennis Club. 370 Park Ave, NYC. Contributions may be made to The Jinni Israel Fund, Care of Kids in Crisis, 1 Salem St. Cos Cob, CT 06802.
