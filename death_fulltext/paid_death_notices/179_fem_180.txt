        KERLIN-Sarah M. The Board of Directors and staff of Wave Hill mourn the loss of our beloved friend Sally Kerlin. Sally's vision guided the creation of Wave Hill's many educational programs and her generosity planted the seeds of knowledge that will intrigue and inspire generations to love and embrace nature. For her tireless efforts to preserve the environment and to improve the way we educate our children, our admiration knows no bounds. We long for her blithe spirit and engaging smile. Sally leaves this world much better than she found it, and we will miss her very much. Our hearts reach out to Gilbert, her devoted husband of 61 years, their loving children, Sarah Gray Gund, Gilbert Nye Kerlin and Jonathan O. Kerlin, their grandchildren, Joshua Gray, Sarah Gray Rakovshik, Peter Kerlin and Abigail Kerlin, and their great-grandchildren, Xenia Rakovshik, Alexander Rakovshik and Nicholas Gray. David O. Beim, Chairman Kate French, President
