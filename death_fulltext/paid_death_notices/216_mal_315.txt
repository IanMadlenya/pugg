        CARTER--Dr. Sidney. Humanism in medicine has lost a much loved role model. A brilliant leader, teacher and diagnostician, Dr. Sidney Carter's legendary compassion and concern for patients and families was his greatest gift. He truly practiced the ''art of medicine,'' a legacy that lives in those he taught. Arnold P. Gold, M.D. Professor of Clinical Neurology and Pediatrics Columbia University
