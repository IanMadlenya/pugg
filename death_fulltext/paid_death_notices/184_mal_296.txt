        NICHOLS-Robert E. Jr. ''Chip.'' On Friday night, May 17th, 2002. He was an artist. His love of painting was second only to his love of those around him. Generous in giving of himself, he made a difference in many lives. Unique in his vision he challenged mediocrity. His vitality was contagious. Chip was Chip. He was real. One of a kind. A masterpiece. He is missed, though his spirit shines in the hearts of those who remain. His life companion Linda. His two sons Jordan and Kristin. His brother Arthur. His two sisters Dawn and Jerilee. And his favorite cat, Jimmy.
