        KIRSCH-Murray H. Beloved husband of Helen. Devoted father of Barbara and Arthur. Adored grandfather of David, Miriam and Laura. We deeply mourn the loss of a man who had endless love for his family and friends. His kindness, warmth, sense of humor and caring ways will always be remembered and he will be deeply missed.
