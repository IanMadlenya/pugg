        SHAPIRO-Louis. Yeshiva University and its affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary mourn the passing of an admired leader of the Jewish community, a longtime friend and generous supporter who was a YU Guardian with his beloved wife, Pauline. They established the Pauline and Louis Shapiro Reading Area in the Mendel Gottesman Library as well as the Pauline and Louis Shapiro Mishnayos Bekiyus Competition at RIETS. Holocaust Studies Fellows, RIETS Fellows, and High School Fellows, they sponsored the annual Cong. Beth Judah YU Breakfast for many years and established a scholarship in their name at Samuel H. Wang-YUHS for Girls. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Pauline; children, Martin (and Patricia) Shapiro, Harvey (and Eileen) Shapiro, and Sheila (and Mark) Rosler; grandchildren; and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Robert M. Beren, Chairman, Board of Trustees Yeshiva University
