        RUIZ--Edward. With great sadness we acknowledge the passing of our brother Edward in Cape Town. Thoughtful and generous, he made a lasting impression on those who knew him. Our mother Miriam is forever grateful to his loving surrogate family, including Marina Petropulos and Mica Naumann of Cape Town. Edward died living out his dream among people of kindred spirit. He will be missed but not forgotten, and his essence will live on through his photographs. A memorial will be held on Thursday, 7pm, at NY Quarterly Meeting House, 15 Rutherford Pl., NYC.
