        VOULKOS-Peter. Friends of Contemporary Ceramics are deeply saddened by the death of Peter Voulkos, the leading figure in Postwar American ceramics, on February 16. Voulkos, whose exhibition record spans over five decades, had an international impact as the leader of a revolutionary movement in contemporary ceramics. Respected by critics, museum curators, and artists around the world, Voulkos' work is included in over eighty museums. He is the recipient of six honorary doctorates and other honors too numerous to mention. Pete was an extraordinary man, loved and respected by his fellow artists. Like the Pied Piper, where Pete went, artists were sure to follow, be it a workshop, the opening of a Voulkos exhibition or a dinner. Everyone wanted to be around Pete. We will all miss him very much. Our heartfelt condolences to his wife Ann Adair Voulkos, their son Aris, and Pier Voulkos, his daughter from a previous marriage.
