        WHITE-Eileen Kerrill. On May 4, 2000, at age 60, in New York City. Beloved sister of Robert White and Philip White; aunt of Maureen Ann, Linda, Kerrill, Kristina, Stefanie, James and Christopher; sisterin-law of Anna Mae White and Sigrid Kornacker and aunt-in-law of Rosalie Divall, all of whom were so especially there for Eileen, plusaunts, cousins, grand-nieces and grand-nephews. Eileen was endowed with a rare grace and Irish beauty that was cherished by her friends and family and admired by her colleagues and those who shared her sense of humor and keen intellect. She was a graduate of Hunter College. Until her illness, she was a major gifts officer for New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. Earlier, she held a similar position at Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center. While a student, she took part in archaeological digs in Greece, where she developed a lifelong appreciation of the art and poetry of this ancient civilization. A joyous highlight in Eileen's life took place this past March 17 when she attended the St. Patrick's Day gala at the White House. Eileen's dynamism, her caring warmth, her uncompromising ethical standards and her dignified beliefs were appreciated by all who knew her, and she will be lovingly remembered. She remains a beacon for us all. We also wish to thank the Urgent Care Staff at Memorial Sloan-Kettering for their wonderful care of our sister.
