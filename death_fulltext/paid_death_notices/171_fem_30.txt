        SCHAEFER-Helene Hollis. The College of New Rochelle community records with sorrow the death of Helene Hollis Schaefer '85, LHD '99, at the age of 101. The embodiment of the pursuit of lifelong learning, her enduring passion and unabashed delight in learning brought her the Bachelor of Arts degree at the age of 85 and the Master of Arts degree at 90. As she approached 100, the College was honored to confer on her the honorary degree, Doctor of Humane Letters. Her life, lived in three different centuries, was animated by a generous spirit and was filled with wisdom, warmth, and wit. We mourn her loss and celebrate her life. Stephen J. Sweeny, Ph.D. President Jean Baptiste Nicholson, O.S.U. Chair, Board of Trustees
