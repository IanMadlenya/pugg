        BRESLAUER -- Bernard H., bibliophile, died in New York City on Saturday, August 14, 2004 at age 86 of congestive heart failure. Only son of Martin and Grete Breslauer of Berlin, he joined his father's firm of antiquarian booksellers in 1935, fleeing the Nazis in 1937 to settle in London, where after voluntary military service during the war he became the leading binding expert in the book trade. He advised and represented at auction the greatest private collectors and many institutional libraries in Europe and America. In 1977, he moved to New York to his apartment overlooking the Metropolitan Museum which became the inevitable port-of-call of visiting European bibliophiles. In 1978, he established a worldrecord price for a printed book by purchasing the Gutenberg Bible on behalf of the State Library of Wuerttemberg. He was the author of several authoritative monographs and a long series of scholarly and well-written catalogues. In 1997, the Free University of Berlin conferred on him an Honorary Doctorate of Letters for his contributions to bibliophily and bibliographical scholarship. Dr. Breslauer formed unmatched private collections of medieval manuscripts, illuminations and, most originally, of historical bibliography in finely bound association copies. He was also a discriminating patron of contemporary artistic bookbinders. In 1996, he was made an Honorary Fellow of the Pierpont Morgan Library, a rare distinction. In 1998, the London quarterly journal, The Book Collector, devoted a special issue to mark Dr. Breslauer's 80th birthday. He will be greatly missed in the world of rare books. Dr. Breslauer leaves no family. His friends will organize a memorial reception on a date soon to be announced.
