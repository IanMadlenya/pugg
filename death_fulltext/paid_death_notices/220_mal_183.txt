        PARKER--Julius, M.D. The President and Trustees of Montefiore Medical Center are profoundly saddened by the passing of Julius Parker, M.D., an esteemed colleague and friend. Dr. Parker, an attending physican for fifty years at Montefiore, and a former chief of the Division of Gastroenterology began the Division's residency training program in 1959 and mentored hundreds of its participants in his long tenure at the medical center. Dr. Parker took a keen interest in the inner workings of the hospital, serving both as president of the medical staff and Staff and Alumni Association. Our heartfelt condolences are extended to his children, Jonathan and Wendy and his five grandchildren. Spencer Foreman, M.D. President Jay B. Langner, Chairman Board of Trustees Montefiore Medical Center
