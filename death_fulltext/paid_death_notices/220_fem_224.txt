        LAREDO--Ruth. It is with profound sadness that we mourn the death of our beloved friend, pianist Ruth Laredo. She became a part of Young Concert Artists in 1962 and we were proud of the range of her career as a soloist, chamber musician and as an inspiring mentor to young performers. Ruth was always ready to give of herself and she passionately led the Young Concert Artists Alumni Association as President for over a decade. She will be greatly missed. Our sympathy goes to her adored daughter, sonin-law and grandchild. Susan Wadsworth Young Concert Artists, Inc.
        LAREDO--Ruth. We will always miss you: a great artist and our special friend. Maverick Concerts
