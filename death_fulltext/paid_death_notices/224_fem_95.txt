The Officers, National Board of Directors, professional staff and Chapter Members of American Friends of Magen David Adom-ARMDI note with deep sadness the passing of Romaine Efros, a generous and dedicated member of the Emanuel Cellar Chapter of ARMDI for more than 40 years. She was a loyal and ardent friend of Israel and will be deeply missed by all who knew her and benefited from her generosity and warm heart. Our heartfelt sympathy goes out to her family. May the memories of her life be as a blessing to her family and all who knew her. Stuart A. Jackson, Chairman Mark D. Lebow, President Daniel R. Allen, Exec. V.P.
