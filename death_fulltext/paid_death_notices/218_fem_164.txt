        FROST--Margaret. 91, a longtime resident of Southampton, died peacefully on March 17, 2005. Known to her friends as Mardie, she was noted for her great beauty, her wit, and her artistic talent. Mrs. Frost, nee Margaret Lawrance, was born in Paris on September 24, 1913, and grew up in Islip, NY. She was the great-granddaughter of John Dix, governor of New York. She was married to the late Winston Frost for almost 50 years, and is survived by their daughter, artist Dora Frost of Southampton, as well as two children by a former marriage to the late Drayton Cochran: Charles Cochran of West Palm Beach, FL, and Catherine Cochran of Palmyra, VA. She is predeceased by a son, John Cochran. Mrs. Frost also leaves three grandchildren: Angela Farrell, Jay Cochran and Cecilia Cochran, and five great-grandchildren. A memorial service in Southampton will be announced in late Spring. Instead of flowers, donations may be made to Saint John's Church, Southampton, NY.
