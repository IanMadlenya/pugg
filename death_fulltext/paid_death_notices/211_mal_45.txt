        SILBERZWEIG -- Sol. The American Society for Yad Vashem mourns the passing of Sol Silberzweig, Board member and benefactor of Yad Vashem. A Holocaust survivor who survived the Warsaw Ghetto uprising and seven concentration camps, lost his whole family except one brother who was living in the United States. He went on to become a highly successful businessman in the fur trade. A book about Mr. Silberzweig's life will be published shortly by Yad Vashem. He is survived by daughters Rochelle Cherry and Leslie Rueda, son Moe Silberzweig, eight grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. Eli Zborowski, Chairman American Society for Yad Vashem
