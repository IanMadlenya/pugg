        CLEMENT-Paul. The New York Philharmonic deeply mourns the passing of Paul Clement, a member of the Philharmonic's cello section from 1963-1995. Prior to joining the Orchestra, Mr. Clement was a member of the Pittsburgh Symphony and the NBC Symphony Orchestra under Toscanini. Mr. Clement, who attended Columbia University, was a man of many interests and talents, including chess, French literature and chamber music. He was a member of the Galimir String Quartet. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Marion, his children, Joan and Daniel, and to his entire family. Lorin Maazel, Music Director Members of the Orchestra Paul B.
