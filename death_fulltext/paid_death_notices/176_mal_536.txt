        BERKELEY-Graham. In loving memory of Graham, beloved son of Charles and Pauline Berkeley of Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England, graduate of the Royal College of Music, London and at his untimely death, Director E-Commerce Solutions, Compuware Corporation, USA. Graham Berkeley, 37, was a resident of Boston and his beloved Provincetown, MA. Graham embraced life and the many friends he made in turn embraced his warmth, charm, intelligence, wicked sense of humor and love of music. An accomplished classical violinist, a fan of the opera, fitness enthusiast and a world traveler, Graham was a true Renaissance man. After a ten year effort, Graham finally received his Green Card for US residency in June; he was planning on a move back to New York at the end of September. Graham met his death on September 11, in the World Trade Center attack in the city and country he loved so much and where he had so many valued friends. He will be sorely missed by his parents, his brothers Chris and Roger, and by all who were blessed to know him. A memorial service will be held in New York City on Friday, Oct. 12, at 12:30 PM at Grace Church, 802 Broadway, corner East 10th Street. There will be a reception for family and friends immediately following the memorial service.
