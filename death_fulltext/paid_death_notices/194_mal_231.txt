        ROSENZWEIG-Eli. The Partners & Staff of Brauner, Baron, Rosenzweig & Klein, LLP, are deeply saddened by the loss of our friend, mentor and retired partner, Eli Rosenzweig. In his more than sixty years as a partner and counsel to our firm, he was an exemplar of the high stardard of intellectual rigor, and human decency to which we all aspire. Even after his formal retirement, he remained actively engaged in the activities of the firm and the needs of his clients. We will miss his counsel and his wit, and extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Bunny, his children, Linda and Robert, Kenneth and Penny, and David and Claire, his grandchildren, Bess, Jacob, Allison and Jordan, and his brother, Irving.

The integrity, intelligence, and tireless wit he brought to every interaction will be remembered by all who knew him. The unique warmth and generosity of his spirit will be missed more than can be expressed.
