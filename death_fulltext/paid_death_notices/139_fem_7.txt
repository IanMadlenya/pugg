        BASILEVSKY-Helen, 59. Of New York City and Rensselaerville, NY. Beloved daughter of Nathalie and sister of Peter, died July 31, 1998 after a long illness. An artist and teacher, she was the head of the Art Department at Nightingale Bamford School, highly respected and well loved by friends, colleagues and several generations of students. Her work has been shown in galleries and museums but her proudest accomplishment was the many students who gained an appreciation for beauty, art and culture through her efforts as a teacher. A gentle, gracious person who was always more interested in others than herself, she will be sorely missed by all those whose lives she touched. Funeral services will be held on Sunday night August 2, 1998 at 6 P.M., at Christ the Savior Russian Orthodox Church, 340 East 71 Street, New York, New York, 10021. Burial services Monday, 9:45AM at Christ the Savior Church with interment at The Russian Orthodox Convent of ''Novo Diveevo'', 100 Smith Road, Nanuet, NY. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be sent to City Meals on Wheels, 355 Lexington Ave., NY NY 10017 and Christ the Savior Church.
