        GOODMAN-Claire. Age 85. Died October 2, 1997 in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida after a long illness. Claire was a pioneer in the New York decorative fabric business, having been the first woman to hold an executive sales position in that industry. A loyal and caring friend with a wonderfully unique and often irreverent sense of humor, she will be sorely missed by her friends and family. Claire is predeceased by her husband, the late Philip Goodman, and survived by her loving nieces, Linda Yellin and Joan Kasler of Southern California and nephew Richard Kaplan of San Francisco.
