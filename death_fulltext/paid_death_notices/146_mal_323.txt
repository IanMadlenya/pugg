        TELL-Norman. With deep sorrow, we mourn the loss of our dear friend, founding member, past President, Board member and wise counsel to our congregation. He spoke his thoughts, gave of his wisdom and experience and opened his heart for many philanthropic causes. Our children benefitted from his care and counsel and we from his presence. He donated his many energies not only to our congregation but to many charities and we will miss him dearly. We pray that Norman will now have eternal peace.
