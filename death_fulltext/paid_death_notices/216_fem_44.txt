        WIDDOES--Cathalene Crane, mother of Ned and Chevy Chase, Pamela, Catherine and John Cederquist, grandmother of Cydney, Caley, Emily, Lila and Neddy Chase, and of Miles Cederquist, and loving wife of Lawrence Widdoes, died in Manhattan on New Year's Day, surrounded by those she dearly loved. Nee Cathalene Parker Crane, she married Edward T. Chase of Woodstock in 1941. In 1951, she married her second husband, Dr. John W. Cederquist of NYC. In 1976, she married composer and Juilliard teacher, Lawrence Widdoes. For 53 years, Mrs. Widdoes split her time between Manhattan and New York's Hudson Valley. Like herself, many of her friends were artists and musicians. Mrs. Widdoes was an accomplished pianist, endowing her children and grandchildren with a legacy of love for, and talent in, all musical fields. She will be missed. A viewing and memorial service will be held at Lasher Funeral Home in Woodstock, on Saturday, January 8th, at Noon.
