        GOTTLIEB--Jay. All of us at Brown Raysman Millstein Felder & Steiner are stunned and deeply saddened by the sudden, tragic loss of our partner, Jay Gottlieb, in an automobile accident. There was no finer colleague, friend, father, husband. His devotion to his family and our firm and his constant counsel, in law and life, will be reminders to us all to enrich and savor every moment. Our heartfelt condolences to Diane and their children, Aaron, Rachel and Brian, Jay's parents and the rest of his family. Jay made us feel like family, and we will always be proud to have known and worked with him. Services at Noon, Sunday, November 13, Simpson Gaus Funeral Home, 411 Albany Avenue, Kingston, N.Y., 845-331-0631
