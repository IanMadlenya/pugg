        ANCELL-Nathan S. It's very simple! I will not permit you, Nat Ancell, to walk out of my life and the lives of Daytop's youngsters without notice! Those sunrise breakfast sessions at Mill Road in Eastchester brought teacher and student together. And I, the attentive listener, soon learned how much goodness, combined with the strong faith of a young Rabbinical candidate and a driving vision, could transform a deep concern for the well-being of the American family into a monumental effort to bring the young back from the streets with their friends into the family living rooms. The attraction - warm, comfortable furnishings. Ethan Allen was born! And, more recently, he descended upon the living rooms of Daytop's Kids and wept as he heard syllables of hope and raw courage from the lips of wounded youngsters. And our world at Daytop became brighter overnight. Heaven welcome home a Native Son! Our prayerful support for Susan and Penny and the Family. (Msgr.) William B. O'Brien President Daytop Village, Inc.
