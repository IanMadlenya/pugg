        SPANBOCK--Jonathan Harris. On February 10, 2005. Beloved husband of Carol. Adored father of Sara, Dina and Benjamin. Cherished son of Marion and Maurice. Dearest brother of Betsy and Andrew.
        SPANBOCK--Jonathan. It is with profound sadness that the Heschel community extends its sympathies to Carol, Benjamin, Dina and Sara Spanbock, Maurice and Marion Spanbock and the entire extended Spanbock and Zingale families on the untimely loss of their husband, father and son, Jonathan Spanbock. Jonathan was a beloved, respected and admired member of our Board of Trustees, whose contributions informed and infused the everyday workings of our school and strengthened the institution in ways too numerous to recount. We relied on his wisdom, integrity and compassion and our lives have been immeasurably elevated by having him in our midst. Roanna Shorofsky, Head of School Alisa R. Doctoroff, President The Abraham Joshua Heschel School
