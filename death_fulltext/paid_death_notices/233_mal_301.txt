        DRETZIN--David. The Nation magazine mourns the loss of David ''Duff'' Dretzin, our long time labor lawyer and a remarkable, generous man. Duff was much more than an esteemed colleague, he was our friend. We will remember him always for his exceptional kindness, his many good works, and his wise counsel. Our sympathies to his wife Joanna, his daughters Rachel and Julie, his extended family and his many, many friends. We will miss you, Duff. The Nation
