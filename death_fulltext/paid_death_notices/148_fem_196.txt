        KLAUS-Ida. The American Diabetes Association notes with sorrow the passing of its former secretary, Ida Klaus. Ms. Klaus was the secretary of the New York Diabetes Association and served on the executive committee during the late 1960's through the mid 1970's. She was a fundraiser par excellence and was instrumental in rekindling interest in membership, especially in the New York City area. Ms. Klaus was dedicated to the organization and will be missed by all who knew her.
