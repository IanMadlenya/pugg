        KATZELL-Raymond A., 83. A beloved professor of Industrial and Organizational Psychology, and influential in his field as Peter Drucker was in Economics, died February 5, 2003. Deeply mourned by the NYU Psychology Dept., he as its Chair from 1963 to 1972 guided it to eminence. He authored two important books, ''Testing and Fair Employment''; ''Work, Productivity and Job Satisfaction''; mentored 30 Ph.D. candidates; led in establishing the New York State laws for licensing psychologists; and was the president of numerous professional societies, and a consultant to many leading industrial firms. An aficionado of classic cars, he edited a prizewinning book, ''The Splendid Stutz''. He is survived by his wife, Mildred, known as Kitty. There will be a memorial service at Medford Leas Auditorium in Medford, New Jersey at 2:15 PM, on March 16, and one at NYU's King Juan Carlos Center at 4:00 PM on April 28.
