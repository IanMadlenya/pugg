        CROSBY-John O. The Board of Directors of The Santa Fe Opera and the Board of Trustees of The Santa Fe Opera Foundation note with great sadness and a sense of deep loss the death of the Opera's founder and General Director Emeritus, John O. Crosby. A pioneer in American opera, John Crosby founded The Santa Fe Opera in 1957 as a summer festival in a theater that accommodated 480 people, located in the spectacular Sangre de Cristo Mountains. His vision led him, at age 29, to found a company that regularly presented rarely performed and contemporary works and engaged first-rate young American singers. In its first season, The Santa Fe Opera established an apprentice program for singers, the first program of its kind, adding a program for technical apprentices the following year. Mr. Crosby served as General Director of the company until August 2000. The Santa Fe Opera continues today to abide by John Crosby's precepts and insights, continuing to present the finest opera on the same site in a theater that now seats 2,168. The roster of former solo artists and apprentices fills today's opera houses around the world. American opera has lost a giant. David K. Ingalls, Chairman, The Santa Fe Opera Susan F. Morris, President, The Santa Fe Opera William D. Armstrong, Chairman, Santa Fe Opera Foundation Patricia A. McFate, President, Santa Fe Opera Foundation
        CROSBY-John O. The world of classical music mourns the sudden loss of one of its greatest and most important leaders, John O. Crosby, Founding General Director of The Santa Fe Opera. In his nearly fifty years of activity in this position his taste, professional discipline and vision have enormously and permanently influenced the course of opera in America and worldwide. I will mourn a great mentor, sterling example and a shy and loyal friend. Matthew A. Epstein Lyric Opera of Chicago
