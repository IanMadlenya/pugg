        JARCHO--Thomas, 53, a passionate musician, American Flyer repairman, and fisherman off the New England coast. He loved best those who will most miss his fierce intelligence and maverick spirit--his wife Fredrica, daughter Julia, son Nicholas, mother Irma, brother Andrew, and other family and good friends.
