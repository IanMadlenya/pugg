        NATVIG-Arthur G., age 84, native of Brooklyn, New York and along time executive at Citibank, died on April 18, 2000 at New Port Richey, Florida after a lengthy illness. Mr. Natvig began his career with Citibank as a 15 year old office boy in 1931 in New York City and retired in 1976 as a Vice President of one of the world's largest banks. He attended Brooklyn College at night for seven years graduating Summa Cum Laude. During World War II he served in the U.S. Army. In the early 1950's he joined Citibank's Comptroller's Domestic Inspection Division and within a few years moved to International Inspection, where he was to spend the remainder of his banking career. During that period he traveled around the world nearly 50 times. During his tenure in the Comptroller's Division, Mr. Natvig was regarded by many as the bank's foremost expert on Foreign Exchange. In addition to being instrumental in establishing Citibank branches around the world, he created and maintained the Inspector's Handbook, which reportedly was considered of incalculable value to the Inspection effort throughout Citibank's International Operations. After his retirement Mr. Natvig remained with Citibank in an advisory capacity for five years working in Asia, Australia, Europe, South America, Canada and the Caribbean. Mr. Natvig leaves two sisters, Ruth Halstead of New Port Richey and Joan Shuman, of Centerville, Massachusetts; four nieces and two nephews; 10 great nieces and nephews.
