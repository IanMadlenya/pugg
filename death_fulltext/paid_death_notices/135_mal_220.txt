        ZUGER-Bernard, M.D. We mourn the passing of a longtime, very dear and wonderful friend who was the finest of finest. He was a true scholar of medicine and psychiatry. His contributions are classics to the clinical science of psychiatry. Bernie was a unique husband, father, professional and friend. All of us were privileged to benefit from his erudition and his warm friendship. We express our deepest sympathy to his very talented and devoted spouse Miriam and his daughter, the physician and author, Dr. Abby Zuger. Doris and Saul Farber
