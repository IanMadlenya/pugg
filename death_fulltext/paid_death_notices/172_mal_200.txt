The directors and members of the New York Building Congress, which George Fox chaired from 1983 to 1986, remember a man of enormous vision and dignity. He inspired us all with his uncommon ability to bring together a diverse and often fragmented industry with his keen intellect and quiet determination. We celebrate his unsurpassed commitment to the construction field and the City of New York. George Fox left his mark on New York everywherefrom the vast subterranean tunnel structure beneath the City to the education of our youth and the highest standards of public service.
