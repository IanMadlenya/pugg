        FERENTZ--Leslie B. Died April 9th. Family and friends mourn the passing of this 87 year old master story teller and decorated WWII combat vet. A gifted salesman in the drug sundries trade, he was also the Secretary of the Rosedale Jewish Center and Independent Wizner Society. In 1958 he was Worshipful Master of Beethoven Lodge 661.

He will be dearly missed by Sylvia, his wife of 65 years, his daughters Maris and Cheryl, and son Kevin, their spouses, his daughter-in-law Satu, his eleven grandchildren (and three spouses), and his three great-granddaughters. The funeral will be held today at Schwatz Bros, in Forest Hills. The family will sit shiva in Queens, Poughkeepsie and Baltimore.
