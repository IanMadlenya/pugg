        MERRILL-David. We mourn the loss of our dear friend on February 13, in his Washington, DC home at 38. Formerly of New York City, he is survived by his parents, Lois and Edward Merrill, of Glen Rock, NJ; a brother, Ted, and a sister, Ruth, and his partner, David Carrig of Washington, DC and colleagues at Discovery Channel. He graduated Emerson College. He had the right perspective on life and though his days were short, he truly lived to the fullest. His dry wit and knack for telling funny stories helped us take ourselves a little less seriously. Services will be held at Browning-Forshay Funeral Home, 557 Lafayette Avenue, Hawthorne, NJ at 3:30pm Saturday, February 19 with visitation on Febraury 18, 7-9pm and February 19, 2-3:30pm. Memorial contributions may go to GLAAD (Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation), 1825 Connecticut Ave NW, 5 Flr, Washington DC 20009 or God's Love We Deliver, 166 Avenue of the Americas, NY, NY 10013.
