        LOREN - Seymour. We mourn the passing of Dr. Seymour Loren, of Riverdale, on July 28, at age 89. He was the husband of the late Blanche Morse Loren. He is survived by a daughter Frances Loren Scovronick, of Princeton, NJ, and a son Ralph Loren, of Acton, MA, as well as four grandchildren: Sara and Noah Scovronick, and Lisa and Scott Loren. Until his retirement last year, Dr. Loren had an active dental practice in New York for over 60 years. His devoted patients came from all walks of life, including the theater, the circus, and the UN. His loss is felt by many whose lives he touched over the years. Services today, 11:30 am, at ''The Riverside,'' 76th St and Amsterdam Ave.
