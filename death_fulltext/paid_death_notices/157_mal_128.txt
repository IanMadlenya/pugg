        ELVIRA-Pablo. We note with great sadness the death of Pablo Elvira, a good friend and colleague. His memorable performance in Donizetti's ''La Favorita'' with Barbara Hendricks, Shirley Verrett, Alfredo Kraus and James Morris will long be remembered, as will his appearance in Boito's ''Nerone.'' Mr. Elvira will always be thought of with affection and respect by all at Opera Orchestra and his ringing baritone voice will be missed. Our heartfelt sympathy and condolences to his wife Signe, his son Pablo, and his family. Eve Queler and Opera Orchestra of New York
