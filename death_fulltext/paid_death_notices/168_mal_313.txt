        ROZBRUCH-Max. Died on the Sabbath of January 20, 2001, on his 83rd birthday; courageous at death as in life. Beloved and caring husband and best friend of Frieda, his wife of 55 years. Loving, devoted and revered father of Jacob, Alfie and Sandy. Adoring father-in-law to his girls Marsha, Hedy and Yonina. Generous and doting grandfather to Alison, Joshua, Andrew, Jenny, Jason and Libby. Beloved and caring ''big brother'' of the late Martin Rozbruch and Mario Brandt. Born in a small village near Lublin, Poland, the Holocaust separated him by death from his parents and baby sister. He survived the war by evading the Nazis and lived underground in bunkers for four years until the liberation. Throughout this ordeal he saved his three young cousins in the bunkers with him. After the liberation he met his beloved Frieda. They traveled to Italy where they settled and began their beautiful life together. The family came to America in 1953 and began a new life. Max trained himself in his new professiona as a kosher butcher. Through selfless hard work and devotion he supported his wife and three sons. His own education cut short by the war, he nurtured and supported his three sons and saw them all become successful professionals. He delighted in the accomplishments of all of his grandchildren. A sweet, gentle, humble and pious man, a ''prince of a man,'' he brought unlimited love, joy and comfort to all of us who knew and loved him. God's speed on your journey Mordechai Aryeh Ben Shimshon Dovid.
