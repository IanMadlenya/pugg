        LEVIN-Milton. The firm of Max Gruber Associates mourns the passing of our esteemed senior member, Milton Levin, who along with his partner, Maurice D. Gruber, developed much of the land on Long Island. For the past 55 years they were developers, builders and owners of properties such as Westbury Music Fair. Together they assembled land for builders including Levitt and Sons, builders of Levittown and others. Mr. Levin's keen wit marked by frequent puns, sound judgment and striking ability to close a deal will be missed. Mr. Levin's son, James P. Levin, has also been an important part of the firm for the past 27 years and will carry the firm forward along with Philip Gruber. Mr. Levin was an active contributor to charities such as UJA-Federation and Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University where he was a founder and honorary member of the Board of Overseers. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Fanny, and children, James Levin and Gene Heller, and grandchildren, Michael Heller, Kenneth Heller, Joanna Levin Karp, Stephanie Levin and Alexander Levin. Maurice Gruber, Principal Philip Gruber and Nathaniel Finkelstein
