        DYSON-Dr. Anne E. The Board of Directors, performers and staff of the Big Apple Circus mourn the passing of Dr. Anne E. Dyson, friend, colleague and inspiration. Over the last decade the Big Apple Circus and the Big Apple Circus Clown Care Unit (CCU) Program have been the beneficiaries of her wisdom and commitment. As a member of the CCU Advisory Committee, Dr. Dyson's counsel guided the implementation of a strategic plan for national expansion of the CCU, enabling its clown doctors to bring joy, laughter and wonder to bedsides of ever greater numbers of hospitalized children. That plan continues and has resulted in the Big Apple Circus Clown Care Unit making nearly 180,000 annual bedside visits in 14 leading pediatric facilities across the nation. Dr. Dyson was a visionary leader, a powerful force for the care of children, and a good friend. We were inspired by her life's work for children and in her memory rededicate ourselves to our shared commitment to children and their families. We extend our sincerest condolences to her family and her colleagues. Paul Binder, Founder Michael Christensen, Co-Founder Gary Dunning, Executive Director
