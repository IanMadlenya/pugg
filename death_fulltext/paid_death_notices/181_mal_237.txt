        STEVENSON-John. Tony Award Productions mourns the loss of our cherished colleague, whose wise advice and sound business acumen help guide the Tony Awards for several decades. Our deepest sympathy is extended to his adoring wife, Isabelle, Chairman of the Board of the American Theatre Wing, and his loving family. He will be deeply missed.
