        RUBIN--Irwin. Beloved husband, father, artist, collector, and professor, passed away in his Brooklyn home on Thursday, April 6. Irwin was a one of a kind combination of wisdom, humor, political punditry and fascination and concern about the large and small facts of life. Always the storyteller and teacher, he touched the lives and sensibilities of so many. He will be deeply missed. Mr. Rubin was born in Brooklyn, New York. He was a graduate of the Yale University School of Art and the Cooper Union School of Art where he also taught. He is survived by his wife Christina, his son Lucas, and his brother Herbert.
