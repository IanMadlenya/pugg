He was a voracious reader who was well-versed in areas from the mundane to the esoteric, a quality that was evidenced whenever he engaged in discussion or debate with one of his family's members. He was an avid sports fan, and loved Saturdays with his Fighting Irish and Sunday with his Miami Dolphins. A cosmopolitan gentleman, he had a love of travel and visited many locations abroad, such as the United Kingdom, France, and his ancestral homeland of Ireland. Whether he was at home or abroad, Mr. Gowen was a lover of food who enjoyed new culinary experiences, although his favorite meals were those shared with a gathering of his children and grandchildren. Of all his joys in life, none was greater to Mr. Gowen than his family. He was dedicated to having special, unique bonds with each one of his children and grandchildren. His memory shall be cherished and he shall be sorely missed by all of them.
