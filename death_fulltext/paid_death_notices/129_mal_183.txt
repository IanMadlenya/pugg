        TWERSKY - Professor Isadore. The Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations at Harvard University & the Harvard Center for Jewish Studies mourn the passing of our distinguished colleague and friend, founding Director of the Center and internationally renowned authority on Jewish intellectual history in all its aspects. As Nathan Littauer Professor of Hebrew Literature and Philosophy he inherited the mantle of his teacher, Professor Harry A. Wolfson, and brought Jewish studies to the very center of university life. He guided the establishment of the Center for Jewish Studies, and by the force of his example as well as through his teaching inspired generations of Harvard students. His own scholarly writings on Maimonides and other crucial figures from the Jewish Middle Ages set a standard of scholarship for the world to follow. His energetic sponsorship of international conferences and publications helped turn Harvard into a center for Jewish studies known and respected throughout the world. We extend our deepest sympathies to his beloved wife, Atarah, and to his children, grandchildren and the entire family. May they be comforted from Heaven.
