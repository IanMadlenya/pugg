        MAIO-Joseph. Tragically stolen from our family after spending what seems like only a few minutes of his precious life with us. Quiet dignity was your trademark but you also combined that with generosity and an unselfish attitude towards everyone with whom you came into contact. You were always a hole-in-one to us and the memory of your sweetness will forever shine in our hearts. Sharri, JoAnn, Chuck, Robyn & Jordan
