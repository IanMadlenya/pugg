        COLM--Werner. Our beloved uncle died on January 3, 2005, at age 97 years. For the past six years we were fortunate enough to develop a close relationship with our uncle Werner and be pleasantly affected by his strong will, high intelligence, tremendous knowledge and especially his kindness and generosity. He will be deeply missed and always close to our heart. Naomi and Michael Mayer, Herzelia Israel
