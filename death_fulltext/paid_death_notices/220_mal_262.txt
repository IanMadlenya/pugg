The Yeshiva University family is saddened by the passing of our long-time friend and supporter and a renowned scientist who, with his entire family, was actively involved in our institution.

May the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel, Pres. Norman Lamm, Chancellor Morry J.
