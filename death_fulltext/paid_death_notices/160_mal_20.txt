        MONEYHAM-Russell. Brooklyn Heights, age 70, born Asheville, N.C. One of the most giving people to ever grace the human race has left the earth. Russ Moneyham who gave much more to all who knew him than he ever received has passed away. He loved small people. The people who could not fend for themselves. He loved Berea College for the chance it gave him in life and the chance it gave all the underprivileged who went there. He was a sports fanatic, always championing the underdog. He believed that everyone should have minimum wages so they could live in dignity. Over the past few years he adopted a number of young people from Bangladesh. He helped these people build a life. The kindness & love Russ exhibited is exactly what every religion espouses and really delivers. NYC will miss a truly good person.
