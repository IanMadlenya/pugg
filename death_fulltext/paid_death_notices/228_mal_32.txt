        WILKINSON - Frank. The American Civil Liberties Union mourns the passing of an esteemed colleague and staunch defender of civil liberties, Frank Wilkinson. For three decades, Frank was subjected to an FBI campaign of surveillance and harassment, spearheaded by J. Edgar Hoover himself. In 1958, Frank was convicted for contempt of Congress, and served 9 months in a Federal prison. He was the plaintiff in the first case to challenge congressional investigating committees as violating first amendment freedoms. He fought that case, in which the ACLU represented him, all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1999, Frank received the ACLU's prestigious Medal of Liberty for his tireless work as champion of civil liberties. He will be sorely missed by all who treasure our right to speak freely.
