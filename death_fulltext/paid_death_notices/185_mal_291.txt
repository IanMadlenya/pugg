        RAUCH-Eduardo. The JTS community mourns the death of Eduardo Rauch, who, since 1978 was a dedicated member of the faculty and administration. A deeply spiritual man of wide-ranging intellectual interests, charismatic classroom instructor and ethical role model, he taught for twenty-four years in the university's Department of Jewish Education and served for twelve years as co-director of its Melton Research Center for Jewish Education where he also was founding editor of the Melton Journal, creating an indispensable resource for Jewish educators. Born in Chile and educated there as a biochemist, he was transformed by his experience living and studying in Israel in the wake of the Six-Day War in 1967. Author of a forthcoming history of American Jewish education in the early 20th century, he published numerous articles for scholarly journals during his career. He is survived by his wife, Chicky, of New York and his father, Nathan, and brother, Claudio, both of Santiago, Chile. Ismar Schorsch, Chancellor Gershon Kekst, Chairman
