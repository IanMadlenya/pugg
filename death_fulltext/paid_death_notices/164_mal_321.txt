        KAHN-Rabbi Shlomo. We extend sincerest condolences to Eva Kahn on the lost of her beloved husband. For nearly forty years, first as a founding member of the original American Committee Board, the Medical Center was the beneficiary of his advice and wise counsel. We shall miss his warm smile. May Mrs. Kahn, daughters Rachel Furst and Yaffa Ungar, and the entire family, be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Amer. Comm. for Shaare Zedek Jerusalem Med. Ctr.
