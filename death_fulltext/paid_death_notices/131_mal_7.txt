        WALTZER-Jack. Our father was a man of exceptional insight and empathy. He had more energy and vitality than most men half his age, and he was an eager and hearty participant in life-always welcoming opportunities and embracing challenges. His lust for life never flagged. His strength of character and generosity were hallmarks of his business and social relationships. And once you earned his friendship, he was always there when you needed him. He had great presence, even charisma. His emotional strength was impressive and his physical vitality and strength were imposing. He was a wonderful story teller, who took great pleasure in entertaining his family and friends. He thoroughly enjoyed his fishing, boating and trapshooting. We will miss him-and all of his countless qualities-dearly. We will miss the extraordinary love he had for our mother, to whom he had been married for 54 years, and for the family they had created together. Our children will miss their loving grandfather. We will miss the unabashed pride he took in our accomplishments, as well as his support and solace in our moments of difficulty and disappointment. We will miss a great man...a genuine mensch...our beloved father. Wayne, Paul, Lori, Alice
