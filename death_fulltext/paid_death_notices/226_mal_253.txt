        CREEDON--Jeremiah (Jerry), 72. Died peacefully at his home on November 20, 2005 after struggling with pulmonary fibrosis that robbed him of breath and sapped his considerable strength. A proud graduate of Fordham ('53) and Columbia (MBA, '58). Jerry served as an officer in the U.S. Army ('54-'56). He loved his career in marketing almost as much as he loved travel; there are few places Jerry did not visit nor leave without a new friendship. Jerry's concern for the world's poor, esteem for education, love of children and strong Catholic faith prompted great generosity. A fine man, he will be missed. Friends may call at Frank E. Campbell-The Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Ave., Tuesday 2-4PM and 7-9PM. Mass of Christian burial, St. John Nepomucene Church, Wednesday 10AM. Interment Calvary Catholic Cemetery (Fla).
