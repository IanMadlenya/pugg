        PINCOVER--Kate. We offer our Kos Tanchumim to Edward Pincover and Ruth Moss on the loss of his beloved mother and her cherished sister. A Diamond Founder, Mrs. Pincover was a gracious, kind and modest woman who made caring for the medical needs of the people of Jerusalem a priority. It could truly be said that her heart beat to the pulse of this holy city. May Edward and Mrs. Moss be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
