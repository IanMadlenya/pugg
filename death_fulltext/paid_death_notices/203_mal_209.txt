        MULHEREN--John. The officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of John Mulheren, a cherished friend who was greatly admired for his extraordinary generosity and compassionate concern. John earned enormous respect for his deep devotion to humanitarian causes and improving the lives of the less fortunate. He expressed an unwavering commitment to UJA-Federation and our beneficiary agencies, in particular the New York Legal Assistance Group (NYLAG). A leader in the financial community, he was honored by UJA-Federation's Wall Street Division in 2001. John will be remembered for his vibrant personality and for his kind efforts to improve the community. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Nancy; to his children; and to the entire Mulheren family. Larry Zicklin, President Morris W. Offit, Chair of the Board John S. Ruskay, Exec. V.P. & C.E.O.
