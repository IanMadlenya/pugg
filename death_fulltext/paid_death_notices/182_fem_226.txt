        FISHMAN-Lillian. On March 22, 2002, at age 93. Beloved wife of the late Noah; mother of David and the late Nancy and mother-in-law of Sandrel. Her life spanned a century of dramatic change, and throughout she remained a loving, caring and wonderful mother, aunt, and friend to all of us. May beautiful memory bring comfort to those who mourn her.
