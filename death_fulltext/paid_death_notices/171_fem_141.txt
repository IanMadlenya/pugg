        MERLO PRODANI-Dorothy. The Board of Trustees and the entire Ethical Culture Fieldston School community note with sadness the untimely death of Dorothy Merlo Prodani '72. Dorothy was a former trustee and the alumni executive board chairperson for six years. Her enthusiasm was an inspiration to us all. Our thoughts are with her family at this difficult time. She is survived by her husband, Alifehim, her son, Ali, her daughter, Aisha, her father, Luis Merlo, who taught Spanish at Fieldston for many years, her two sisters, and her brother. The family has asked that contributions for financial aid be made in Dorothy's name to the Ethical Culture Fieldston School, Office of Development, 33 Central Park West, New York, New York 10023-6001. James A. Gara '72 and S. Donald Sussman Co-Chairs, Board of Trustees Joseph P. Healey, Ph.D. Head of School John Beres '81, President Ethical Fieldston Alumni Executive Board
