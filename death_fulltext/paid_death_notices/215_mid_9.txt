        EGRI--Borbola. The Chernobyl Children mourn the passing of a cherished woman and mother to a champion of their cause, Gabe. Mrs. Egri raised him to be thoughtful and sensitive, and to use his talents for the betterment of the world. His commitment to those in need, particularly children in the Jewish community, is an ongoing tribute to her chessed-a kindness that will live on in Gabe, and in the children whose lives he has helped to save. We extend our heartfelt condolences to her children Gyorgyi, Gabe, and Susan, and to her grandchildren Adina, Daniel, Adam and Anita. May they be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
