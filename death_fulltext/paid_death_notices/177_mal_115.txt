        SOLOVEITCHIK - Rabbi Aaron. The Yeshiva University family and its affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary mourn the passing of a true gadol, and a most eminent rosh yeshiva at RIETS. One of the world's foremost Talmudic scholars, he was warmly revered as the dynamic mentor to generations of students. Himself a distinguished alumnus of Yeshiva College and Musmakh of RIETS, he was a founder of Chicago's Yeshiva of Brisk. With extraordinary courage and determination, he thus advanced the Brisker legacy of Talmudic interpretation carried on by his renowned father, Rabbi Moshe Soloveitchik, and brother, Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik-who were also leading members of the RIETS faculty. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his children, Rabbi Moshe Soloveichik, Rabbi Eliyahu Soloveichik, Rabbi Yosef Soloveichik, Rabbi Chaim Soloveichik, Rachel Leah, and Tovah; grandchildren; and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University Robert M. Beren, Chairman Board of Trustees
