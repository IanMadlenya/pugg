        STEIN--Ernest. How can a man approaching 104 be so young? An old fashioned man so forward looking? A serious man so much fun? A stately man so devilish? Yet, he was not paraxdoxical. He was elegant, generous, kind, beautiful. His intellect stimulated us; his music touched our hearts. We will miss our dear friend Ernest. Helen Stambler and Jim Neuberger
