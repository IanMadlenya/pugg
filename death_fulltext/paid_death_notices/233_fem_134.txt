        DANIEL--Ruth. The World Union for Progressive Judaism notes with profound sadness the passing of Ruth Daniel, our beloved friend and longtime leader, past vice president and treasurer. Her vision, passion and support were invaluable in contributing to the growth and strengthening of Progressive Judaism in Israel and Reform Jewish communities throughout the world. A native of Germany, Ruth escaped the Holocaust by moving to Tel Aviv, and always retained an abiding love for that city, even after moving to the U.S. With her husband Gerry, a past president of the World Union, she helped make possible the construction of Beit Daniel in Tel Aviv, Israel's largest Reform synagogue and community center. Her illness unfortunately prevented her from attending the June 18th dedication of Mishkenot Daniel, the Reform cultural and education center, youth hostel and synagogue in Tel Aviv-Jaffa, attended by the nation's leading government and religious dignitaries. She will be sorely missed but forever remembered for her love of, and commitment to, the dream of Progressive Judaism in the Jewish state. Our heartfelt condolences go out to her husband, children and grandchildren. Steven Bauman, Chairman Rabbi Uri Regev, President
