        SIEGAL-Manahiem, M.D.. Age 90. February 19, 1999. Dr. Siegal was a gentleman in the truest sense who believed he was the luckiest man alive. A physician who volunteered to serve his country in WWII, a President of Samaritan Hospital, he faithfully and enthusiastically shared his life with his patients and his family. Dr. Siegal took each breath with a vigor that brought life to all those around him. Through 90 years, he was loyal son, husband, physician, soldier, father, grandfather, and greatgrandfather. He is survived by his adoring wife of 63 years, Helen, his children Richard and Gail Siegal, Alice and Lester Rubenfeld of Schenectady, NY, his grandchildren Michael and Lori Siegal, Bippy and Jackie Siegal, Jeffrey Siegal, Joshua and Gina Rubenfeld, and Ari Rubenfeld, and two greatgrandchildren Gabriella Siegal and Ezra Rubenfeld.
