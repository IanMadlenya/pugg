        GRUBER--Samuel. We mourn the passing of our good friend, Samuel Gruber, a heroic underground fighter during the Holocaust, a leading partisan commander who kept the torch of Jewish resistance in the struggle against the Nazi enemy, and in the effort in saving Jewish lives. He wrote the book ''I Chose Life''. Let his memory remain as a blessing for all who knew and loved him, and will miss him. Our most heartfelt sympathy to the entire bereaved family.
