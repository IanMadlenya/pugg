        SCHOEN-Myron. The Suzanne and Nathaniel H. Usdan family is profoundly saddened by the sudden passing of Myron Schoen, Executive Director of the Samuel Lemberg Scholarship Loan Fund. For 42 years, his wisdom and insight guided this Foundation to make the difficult choices, but always the right ones, selecting from hundreds each year those worthy of support. His devotion, integrity and compassion shall never be forgotten and his legacy shall live in the hundreds of young people whose lives he changed. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Charlotte and his entire family. The Usdan Family
