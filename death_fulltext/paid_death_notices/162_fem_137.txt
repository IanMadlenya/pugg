        DISPEKER-Thea. The family of Richard Tucker and The Richard Tucker Music Foundation mourn the loss of our dear friend Thea Dispeker. As an artist's manager, she nurtured some of our finest talents and as our friend, she was warm, always in good humor, and above all, faithful. She will be greatly missed. Barry Tucker, President The Richard Tucker Music Fdtn.
