        STRELITZ-Leonard R. The officers and executive staff of United Jewish Communities deeply mourns the passing of Leonard R. Strelitz, United Jewish Appeal National Chairman for 1977 to to 1978 and Honorary National Chairman 1979 to 1999. A larger than life personality, Leonard Strelitz's passionate and indefatigable leadership of the American Jewish community on behalf of Israel and Jews in need around the world was legendary. His legacy of a lifetime of support and assistance to Jewish communal causes is continued by the entire family and currently by his daughter, Bonnie Brand, incoming Women's Campaign Chairperson for the United Jewish Federation of Tidewater and by his son-in-law David Brand, President of the United Jewish Federation of Tidewater., Our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Joyce, and children Brian, Bonnie & E.J.
