        FABIAN-Dr. Dorothy. The NYUHospital for Joint Diseases Department of Orthopaedic Surgery mourn the passing of Dr. Dorothy Fabian, dear wife of Dr. Tibor Fabian, who served as our distinguished Honorary President and Chairman of the Board. Dr. Dorothy Fabian's commitment to the hospital through her undaunting efforts toward enhancing patient care innovative programs will long be remembered. With great foresight, together with her devoted husband, Tibor, they established the Drs. Dorothy and Tibor Fabian Award in 1983. This award, presented annually to an academic member of the hospital for the most outstanding and innovative research publication, continues to stimulate the excellent research work accomplished at HJD. Dr. Fabian's encouragement and philanthropic support will live on in perpetuity through the advancement of our major initiatives. She will be sadly missed. We extend our heartfelt condolences to her sons Timothy and Jonathan and to the entire family. Joseph D. Zuckerman, M.D. Chairman Victor H. Frankel, M.D. President Emeritus
