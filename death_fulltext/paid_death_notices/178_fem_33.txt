        KOFSKY-Marilyn (nee Doppelt). Died on October 29, 2001, surrounded by her adoring family after a long illness. She was a loving and devoted wife, mother, grandmother, sister, friend and teacher. In 25 years as a teacher in the Oceanside Public Schools she touched the lives of hundreds of students and colleagues. Marilyn understood a basic and essential fact of life-by giving of herself she enriched and nourished the lives of others. By giving of herself her spirit and essence will endure and be carried forward. Marilyn built a legacy of a loving and devoted family. She is survived by Herbert, her husband of 52 years, her children, Larry, Susan, Martin and Karen, her grandchildren, Michael, Debbie, Allison, Matthew, Hillary, Morgan, Sean, Stefanie and Mackenzie and her brother Morton Doppelt.
