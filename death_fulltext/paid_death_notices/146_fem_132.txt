        SAMUELS-Barbara L. Died peacefully at home on March 7 at the age of 98. Widow of the late Martin Samuels, she lived a long, lively and independent life, with good health and all her marbles. Last survivor of the five Lindner sisters and their brother, she leaves, through them and through Martin, a large, loving, extended family-to all of whom she has always been, and remains, ''Aunt Barbara.''
