        KENLY--William S. July 5, 1918-July 21, 2005. We remember with great affection Bill Kenly, our long-time friend and colleague at Paramount Pictures. He was smart, funny and charming, and knew everything about the movies. We learned a great deal from him, and will not forget him. His passing marks the end of an era.
