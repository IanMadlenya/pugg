        GOLDBERG--William. Joyfully explaining the love for his trade, a righteous man said diamonds were smiles of G'd. Therefore with devotion he always made his diamonds the prettiest of all, extracting as much light and sparkle as they could possibly give. He was bringing them to life. He, himself was a diamond among men, his facets very defined, his cut was unique, constantly shining and ever sparkling with light and love. A light that came from within and brighter will shine forever. G'd must be very happy today, he got back one of his gems. To the Goldberg family, my sympathy and my love, Natan Volkmar
