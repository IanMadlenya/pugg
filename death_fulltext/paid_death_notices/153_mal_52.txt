        GRIFFITHS-Dan. The New York University Community mourns the passing of the long-time former Dean of its School of Education. Few undertakings are as profoundly important to our society as the training of educators, and Dean Griffiths devoted his life work to this mission. He will be remembered as an excellent educator, a distinguished researcher, the accomplished author of many books and articles, a proud contributor and advisor to many public boards and committees in the field of education, a highly regarded member of this institution, and a good friend. He will be missed. L. Jay Oliva, President Martin Lipton, Chairman Board of Trustees
        GRIFFITHS-Daniel E. It is with profound sorrow that the faculty, staff, students and alumni of the New York University School of Education mourn the passing of our former dean, Daniel E. Griffiths. Appointed dean in 1965, he was a national leader in the field of higher education, and led our School with distinction for 18 years. A specialist in educational administration and administrative theory, he introduced dozens of programs to meet emerging needs and devoted his energies to research development. He will be sorely missed by all of us here at NYU. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Tommie, and children, Priscilla and Michael. Ann Marcus, Dean New York University School of Education
