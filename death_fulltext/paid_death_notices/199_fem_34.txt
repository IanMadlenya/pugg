        CHUTICK--Dr. Lillian. The Yeshiva University family is saddened by the recent passing of a longtime Benefactor who, with her late beloved sister, Dr. Rebecca Chutick, established scholarships and many facilities within the University's various schools, namely the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, the Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology, and the Philip and Sarah Belz School of Jewish Music. May her memory serve as a source of abiding blessing in our midst.
