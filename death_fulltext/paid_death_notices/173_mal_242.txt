        MANDELBAUM-Rabbi Bernard. We record with profound sadness the passing of our beloved colleague. He served the Jewish Theological Seminary with distinction as professor of midrash, director of its Religio-Psychiatry Institute, and, from 1966 until 1972, as its president. He is the author of a critical edition of the midrash, ''Peskita de Rav Kahana''. We express our deepest condolences to his wife, Marcelle, children, Joel, David, Debra, Lyman, Dasi Schlup and Naomi Rosenblum, and to all who were touched through his rabbinate. Rabbi Vernon H. Kurtz, Pres Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Exec VP The Rabbinical Assembly
