        EISENBERG-Arlene. Congregation Ansche Chesed mourns the loss of our beloved friend, past president and illustrious member, Arlene Eisenberg. She was a vital force in the life and revitalization of our community, and her wisdom and generosity of spirit directly touched so many of us.

Sincere condolences to her dear husband Howard, her children and the entire family. Funeral services at Ansche Chesed, 251 West 100 Street, February 9, 11 A.M.
