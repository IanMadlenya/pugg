        CANTOR-Ida Kallet. Age 94. Ida was the most adored person we have ever known. Loved and admired for her gentle disposition and good heart. She went through life helping others with her wise advice and kind smile. She thought of others first and last. Ida, grandma, mother, mother by marriage, we will miss you more than words can possibly express. So dearly loved. So deeply mourned, Ida Kallet Cantor died peacefully at her home, surrounded by her family, on October 26, 1997. Ida was born in New York City, January 23, 1903, and married Louis Harry Cantor (her pharmacist) in 1927. She leaves an empty space forever in the hearts of her grandchildren, Jessica and Douglas, and son by marriage, Ivan. Mommy, I miss you already. Nina.
