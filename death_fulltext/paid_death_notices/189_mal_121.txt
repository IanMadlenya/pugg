        DARELL - Constant. Died peacefully on October 5, 2002 in New York Presbyterian Hospital after a brief illness. Devoted husband of the late Hedy (nee Gunther), to whom he was married for fifty-six years. Beloved father of Edward, loving father-inlaw to Joan. Proud grandfather of Jason and Nicholas. He was a man of remarkable intelligence, strength and resourcefulness, qualities that helped him and Hedy face dangerous and difficult times in wartime Poland. Though he was constitutionally unable to crack a smile before a camera, he had a warm and generous heart, a fine sense of humor and a gift for telling stories far into the night. He was a complex and compelling man and will be greatly missed. His remains have been cremated and a memorial service is planned for the future. In lieu of flowers, a donation may be made to the Kosciuszko Foundation, 15 E. 65th Street, N.Y., N.Y. 10021.
