        KERMAN-Ruth. The leaders and staff of the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services mourn the passing of Ruth Kerman, a staff member for more than 40 years at the Infants Home of Brooklyn, now the IHB Day Treament Center. The office manager at IHB from 1975 until her retirement in 1998, Mrs. Kerman was known to colleagues and clients alike as a loyal and dedicated employee who cared especially about the children served by the Center. We extend our deepest sympathy to the members of Mrs. Kerman's family. Joseph S. Kaplan, President Seymour R. Askin, Jr., Chairman of the Board Alan B. Siskind, Ph.D., Executive Vice President Paul Levine, CSW, Associate Executive Vice President Darlene Foulke, CSW, Director, IHB Day Treatment Center
