Born in Boston to Hyman and Nellie (Wiener) Stutman, he graduated from the Boston Latin School and earned a B.S. from MIT, an M.A. from Boston University, and his M.D. from University of Rochester. Dr. Stutman's medical career began with an internship and residency at Bellevue Hospital from 1953-1957. He then joined the Air Force as a Captain and was stationed Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, OH where he was Chief of the Medical Services Branch 1957-1959. While at WrightPatterson he pioneered inflight testing of cardiovascular function in zero-gravity using specially modified C-47 aircraft outfitted with socalled ''tilt tables.'' Much of his work in the Air Force is recognized as being a foundation of later ''space medicine.''
