Rabin, M.D. She was Professor Emerita of Anesthesiology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY. There she founded the field of obstetric anesthesiology.

She founded the Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology in 1971 and was founding editor of Obstetric Anesthesia Digest. She authored over 30 book chapters, over 150 scientific papers and one textbook, The Physiology of Obstetric Anesthesia that was published in 1969.
