        ROGERS-Fred McFeely. On behalf of the Board of Trustees, Staff and Volunteers of Thirteen/WNET New York, we express our deepest sympathies to the family, friends and co-workers of Fred McFeely Rogers. In a world that is so often loud, violent and sensational, Mr. Rogers was a comforting friend, committed to sharing his peace, love and simple wisdom with America's children. Mr. Rogers was the embodiment of public television's mission, and a hero to all who care about the welfare of our young ones. Parents and children alike will dearly miss his gentle prescence. Steven Rattner, Chairman Dr. William F. Baker, Pres.
