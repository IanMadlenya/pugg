        FRANK-Gerald, for 78 years those privileged to know Jerry Frank were richer in enlightenment and spirit. We were partners and friends and for 35 years I was one of the fortunate ones. I will miss him terribly. I offer my deepest sympathy to June and her family. Jerry was an extraordinary and wonderful person and we are all the poorer for this loss. Richard S. Zimmerman
