        GELB--Mae. Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, Inc., expresses its deepest sorrow at the passing of Mae Gelb, cherished mother of Bev Klein and Sondra Myers. Mae was the treasured grandmother of five, great-grandmother of nine, and great-great-grandmother of one. As a Guardian of the Dream, Mae was a generous benefactor of Hadassah, devoted to Israel and the Jewish people. Her legacy will live on through the programs she supported at the Hadassah Medical Organization, Young Judaea and Youth Aliyah. We extend our most heartfelt condolences to her loved ones. May her memory be for a blessing, and may the family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. June Walker National President Morlie Levin National Executive Director
