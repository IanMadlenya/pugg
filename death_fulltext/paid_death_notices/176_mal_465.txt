        SADDLER-Joe (Sandy), enjoyed a thirteen year professional boxing career consisting of 162 fights, culminating with winning and the holding of the Featherweight Championship of the World for nine years. In the second year of his career, 1945, determination and resilience led Sandy Saddler to fight an astonishing 24 times. Sandy Saddler was the epitome of a gentleman, unfailingly polite, selfeffacing, intellectually curious, always generous to a fault. Indeed, Sandy will be missed.
