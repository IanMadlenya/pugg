        MORRIS--Florence. Passed away peacefully, Friday, June 16, at home, just short of her 92nd birthday. Devoted widow of J. Lincoln Morris (Pud), dear sister of Richard Carlton, sister-in-law of Blossom Carlton, caring aunt of Joyce and Howard Jaffe, Ralph and Susie Carlton, Ken Carlton and Karen and Allan Wood. A longtime resident of Sutton Place and La Coquille at Westhampton Beach, LI. Florence traveled the world but loved New York, where she was a consummate theater goer, bridge player, sometime golfer and tennis player. A vibrant woman who virtually walked through life via the sidewalks of the city and the wonderful beaches of Westhampton shore. Life was an endless panorama of sights and sounds. It was a full life with few regrets--perhaps the envy of all who knew her. The family wishes to express their gratitude to caregivers Audrey Felix and Andrea Fletcher for their dedication to Florence these past years and to the end. Service Tuesday, 11:30 am, at ''The Riverside,'' 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue.
