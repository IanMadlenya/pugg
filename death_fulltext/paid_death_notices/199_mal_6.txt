        TAUSSIG--Walter. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of our beloved associate conductor, Walter Taussig. A member of the Met's music staff since 1949, Walter meticulously coached several generations of singers in their roles, including many of the most famous artists of the last half of the 20th Century. He was truly a link to the great musical traditions of the past, having assisted legendary conductors like Fritz Busch, Emil Cooper, Karl Bohm, and Herbert von Karajan, and tirelessly brought his wealth of knowledge and experience to the musical preparation of Met performances. Walter matched this wonderful musical pedigree with a true talent for teaching musical ideas, and an engaging, warm personality that endeared him to all those who had the privilege of working with him. With Walter's passing, we at the Met have lost one of our artistic treasures and dearest friend. We express our deepest condolences to his wife, Lore, and his daughter, Lynn, and his many friends.
