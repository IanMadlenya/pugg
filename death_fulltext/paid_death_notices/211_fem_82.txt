        CHILD--Julia. The staff of Parade magazine mourns the loss of a friend and colleague. Julia Child, one of America's best loved chefs, was a television icon, a cookbook author, and food editor of Parade from 1982 to 1986. Her column, ''From Julia Child's Kitchen,'' gave Americans an extra dose of Julia's unique style, character, and culinary expertise. She remained a friend to Parade throughout the years. We will miss her kindness and enthusiasm. Walter Anderson, Chairman Parade
