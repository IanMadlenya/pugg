        ST. CLAIR-Michael. Died February 22, 1999 at age 86. Michael St.Clair was a blue-eyed sweetheart. He was also a knowledgeable art dealer and an authority on the works of Marsden Hartley. He was a capital ''D'' down-theline non-swerving Democrat who would have voted for the Devil had that little man run on the ticket. He was a lover of his Fire Island Pines beach house where, on bright summer days, he would mix the best Negronis this side of Venice. He was a dear friend to the late Carl S. Goldberg, a good friend to many, and my best one for over 53 years. Ave Atque Vale. Paul M. Jones
        ST. CLAIR-Michael. The staff and colleagues of Babcock Galleries mourn the passing of a fine gentleman, gracious leader, generous patron and great friend. His wit, intelligence, kindness, steadfast honor, and devotion to art will inspire us all of our days. We thank him for teaching us to cherish the past, love the present, and welcome the future.
