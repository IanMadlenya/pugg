        ROSEN--David Lee, February 16, 1938-August 10, 2003, the most beloved and devoted husband of Martha for 43 years, cherished father of Mark (and Ilene) and Janet (and Tim) and the proud, adoring grandfather to Pamela, Alison, Ruthanne, Caroline and Julia, passed away on Sunday, August 10, 2003 unexpectedly at his summer residence in Stockbridge, MA. Brother of the late Joel (and Joy) Rosen and Rhoda (and Paul) Redleaf, David will be sorely missed by his loving family, his friends and his patients whom he was so dedicated to helping. Magna Cum Laude graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Medical School, David began his career in the Public Health Service in St. Paul, Minnesota. Most of his work, specializing in general medicine and oncology, was in White Plains, NY. David touched so many hearts with his abounding energy, his never-ending optimism, and his zest for life. His greatest joys were in his relationships with the people he loved--a close family and a wealth of dear friends. He will be deeply missed by all who were fortunate enough to know and love him. Funeral services will be held on Wednesday, August 13, at 10 AM at Woodlands Community Temple in Westchester County. The immediate family will be sitting Shiva at their home in Ardsley, New York Wednesday and Thursday from 3-5PM and 7-9PM. Donations in honor of David L. Rosen can be made to Woodlands Community Temple, White Plains Hospital, or The American Cancer Society.
