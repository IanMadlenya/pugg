        LEVY--Beatrice G. Died peacefully on Saturday Jan 14th in her 98th year with family at her side. She had a great run: taught for many years, painted beautifully, traveled the world extensively with her late husband, Nat (Sid to some) and was surrounded by close and loving family. In her own words, she felt lucky--that she had all that she ever wanted. Her daughter, Dr. Cynthia Carver, son Richard Levy, daughterin-law, Jane Hirschmann, grandchildren, Rebecca, Lisa, Sarah, Kate, Nell and Leta and great - grandchildren, Ben, Rachael, Nicole, Hannah and Samantha will remember her sparkle and rejoice in the good life she lived.
