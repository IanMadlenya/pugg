        VON STADE--Philip R. The Trustees and staff of the Shelburne Museum mourn the passing of Philip R. von Stade, our beloved Chairman of the Board. His steady leadership and unflagging devotion were an inspiration and have made the Museum an immeasurably stronger institution. We extend our deepest sympathies to Marjorie & the entire von Stade family.
