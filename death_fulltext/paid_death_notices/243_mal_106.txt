        LeWITT--Sol. The Foundation for Art and Preservation in Embassies is deeply saddened to learn of the loss of Sol LeWitt. His contribution to American art is immeasurable, and we are honored to include his work in our collection. We are grateful for his donation to our new Embassy in Berlin, which will open in 2008, a gift that will be a testament to Sol's creativity and genius, and will perfectly represent the work of one of America's greatest artists.

        $(6$)LeWITT--Sol. The Trustees and Staff of the Whitney Museum of American Art note with deep sorrow the passing of Sol LeWitt. His wall drawings and structures distinguished him as a founder of Conceptual art. A beloved artist in our permanent collection, LeWitt first exhibited at the Whitney in the 1966 Annual and since then his work has been included in over forty exhibitions at the Museum. The Whitney is proud to possess a substantial collection of his work, representing all periods and media and built in part through the great generosity of the artist himself. LeWitt taught us that great art is as much the product of a fine mind as it is superb craftsmanship. We extend our condolences to his family and his many dear friends. Leonard A. Lauder, Chairman Robert J. Hurst, President Adam D. Weinberg, Alice Pratt Brown Director, Whitney Museum of American Art, NY
