        BOILLOT-Lynn Hochschild was elected in 1981 to the Board of Directors of The Jacob and Valeria Langeloth Foundation. In the intervening years, she brought to our deliberations a perceptive understanding of our mission in the field of convalescence and a deep sense of compassion for those less fortunate in securing medical support toward this end. The Directors of The Langeloth Foundation extend their sympathies to her immediate family. John L. Loeb, Jr., Chairman Board of Directors The Jacob and Valeria Langeloth Foundation
        BOILLOT-Lynn Hochschild. The Trustees and staff of the Adirondack Museum mourn the loss of Lynn Hochschild Boillot, a trustee from 1984 to present. During these years her wise counsel, willingness to work, continuity with the founder, and generosity were invaluable to the museum. We shall miss the quality of her presence and her enthusiasm. We extend our profound sympathies to her sons and daughters-in-law. Robert R. Worth President, Board of Trustees The Adirondack Museum
