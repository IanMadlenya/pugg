        PATENT--Samuel R. ''Pat'' We sadly say goodbye to our dear ''Poppa Pat''. He embraced us as his family and we were proud and honored to return his love. We came to know this wonderful man who put love of family and loyalty to friends above all else. Pat lived his life in the same manner in which he left it...on his own terms. We are left with countless memories of celebrations together and many of his stories to remember, for he was a great raconteur. His presence at our table will be missed. To Shirley, Susan, Bob, Patti, Leslie, Michael, Lauren, Russell and Sydney, Ali and Barry, you know how deep our sympathies lie. Our arms are around you all. He loved you all with every inch of his enormous heart. Joanne, Richie, Jason and Jenny
