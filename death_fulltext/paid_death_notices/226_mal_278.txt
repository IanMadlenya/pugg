        DE WILDE--Edy. We note with sorrow the passing of Edy de Wilde, extraordinary long-term director of the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; friend of many contemporary artists; and a founding member of our board of directors. He was a man of unusual intelligence and courtesy. We offer our sympathy to his wife Nono Reinhold and to the family. The Greenwich Collection, Ltd.
