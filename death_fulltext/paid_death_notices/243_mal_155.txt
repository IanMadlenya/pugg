        DODSON--Glenn. The Curtis Institute of Music mourns the loss of Glenn Dodson, alumnus, longtime faculty member, and former principal trombone of the Philadelphia Orchestra. A larger than life figure, he was a master of his instrument, a gifted teacher, a raconteur without peer, and above all, a gentleman. Glenn Dodson played jazz, Dixieland, and big-band music, all with the same enthusiasm and consummate skill that he brought to his symphonic career. His former students now play in America's leading orchestras. His recordings under conductors such as Ormandy, Muti, and Sawallisch set the standard for future generations of trombonists. Everyone at Curtis sends their deepest sympathies to Glenn Dodson's family and condolences to his former students who have lost their mentor. H.F. (Gerry) Lenfest, Chairman Roberto Diaz, President The Curtis Institute of Music
