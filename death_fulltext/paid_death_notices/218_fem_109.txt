        HOLBROOK--Laurie J. Laurie was born on August 9, 1968. She passed gently on March 9, 2005, following a four year battle with a rare form of cancer. She was surrounded by her loved ones, but most especially by her devoted fiance, Joe Diamante. Laurie accepted her fate with tremendous courage and a contagious sense of humor. Laurie drew strength and comfort from her close spiritual relationship with Rev. Ammon, Stephen Minister Sarlin and Elder McKenzie at the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church. Laurie is survived by her parents Ronald and Donna Holbrook of Freeport, ME and her dedicated fiance Joe Diamante of New York City, her sister Kathleen, and her brothers Marty, Peter and John, and grandparents, nieces and nephews, and her cats Vivi and Madison.
