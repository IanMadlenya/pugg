        GARY--Arthur James. A former NBC broadcaster, died at his home in New York City Monday October 31, 2005. He was 91 years old. The cause was leukemia, said his wife, Rosemary Chodorov Gary. During the glorious days of radio, and on into the television era, the sonorous voice of Arthur Gary could be heard broadcasting everything from news to weekly dramas. His work spanned from 1936 to 1984. Born in New York in 1914, he graduated from New York University and became part of the growth of the communications industry under the leadership of David Sarnoff. A private memorial will be announced at a later date.
