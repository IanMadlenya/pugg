        DAVIS-Eli. Hadassah, WZOA, mourns the passing of Professor Eli Davis, beloved Director-General Emeritus of the Hadassah Medical Organization from 1948-51, who died yesterday in Israel at the age of 89. Renowned as a man of both science and letters, Dr. Davis was a pioneer of Israeli medicine and research, a gifted teacher, visionary leader, art collector and published novelist. After the loss of Hadassh Hospital on Mt. Scopus and the murder of 78 medical personnel in 1948, Dr. Davis led Hadassah in rebuilding and maintaining its medical operations. During his decades with Hadassah Medical Organization, he published numerous articles and books on contemporary and biblical medicine, led cutting-edge microcirculation research, and paved the way for Hadassah to become the leading medical center in Israel and the Mideast. He will be greatly missed by all whose lives he touched. Our deepest condolences to daughter Naomi Frenkel, son Haim Divon, and their family. May his memory be for a blessing, and may the family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Marlene E. Post National President Beth Wohlgelernter National Executive Director
