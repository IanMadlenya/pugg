        STATHAKIS-George N. The Board, Staff and Volunteers of the Community Research Initiative on AIDS (CRIA) mourn the passing of our friend and Board Member, George Stathakis. Unfailingly generous with both his time and talents, George began volunteering at CRIA after leaving a successful Wall St. career. He later joined our Board of Directors and served as the organization's Treasurer for the past 3 years. While he failed to benefit from the new treatments that have helped others, George's fight against AIDS was a model of quiet courage and an inspiration for us to rededicate ourselves to discovering more effective treatments. Both his unflinching support of CRIA's AIDS research and treatment educaton efforts and his warm, kind spirit will be deeply missed. Ross Bleckner, President J Daniel Stricker, Exec Dir
