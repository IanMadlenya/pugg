        SCHELPERT-John W., MD. It is with deep and profound regret that James R. Jones, MD, Professor and Chairman, and the faculty of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of New York Medical College acknowledge the tragic death on board Egyptair Flight 990, Sunday, October 31,1999, of Dr. John Schelpert, and his wife, Joanne. Dr. Schelpert was much respected and loved by his colleagues, residents, medical students and patients. He joined the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of New York Medical College in 1989 and retired to Maryland in 1994. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his daughters Jane, Ann, Susan and Elizabeth. Dr. Schelpert and Joanne will be sorely missed by all, and are in our thoughts and prayers.
