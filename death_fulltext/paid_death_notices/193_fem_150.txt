        SLOATE-Elsie K., 96, a model mother, friend and philanthropist, she passed peacefully on February 18. She was there for me throughout my life, particularly when I needed her most. A woman of boundless generosity to her family and far-reaching circle of friends. She left an indelible mark on those she touched with her gifts of spirit and kindness. She was a great philanthropist and a major force behind the Fight for Sight League of Manhattan for more than 35 years. My mother was blessed with a great life and I know that I will live my life in her spirit. In lieu of flowers a research fund has been established in her honor, The Elsie K. Sloate Fellowship Fund, New York Presbyterian Hospital. Your loving daugher, Laura
