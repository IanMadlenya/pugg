        CARRELL-Russell. Of Salisbury Ct. Russell brought life and vitality into the world of antiques. A Russell Carrell Show guaranteed both the collector and the antiques dealer that this was an event of high standards. His shows had a ''special'' look and feel. For over four decades, he was a friend of, and a mentor to, so many. Possessed with a delicious sense of humor, he made those years the best of all possible times. Thanks Russell, for the wonderful memories.
