        AKS-Harold. Sarah Lawrence College mourns the death of Harold Aks, musician, educator, and emeritus member of the Sarah Lawrence faculty. A central figure in the history of the College, he was the legendary director of our chorus and chamber choir for close to forty years, bringing them to international attention and earning the love and respect of generations of students over the years. We will miss the generosity, the kindness, the wit, and the sharp intelligence of this extraordinary man. Our sympathies are with his family. Michele Tolela Myers, President Barbara Kaplan, Dean of the College
