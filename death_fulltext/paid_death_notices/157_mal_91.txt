        THOMPSON-Peter (Frank). Our deepest sympathy to Lanie Thompson, his wife, and to all the family at the sudden and unexpected loss of our dear friend and colleague. Peter was our esteemed pianist and collaborator and a pillar of musical genius. His joyous and exuberant approach to life will remain with us forever. Lynn Starling, Sam Kaufman
