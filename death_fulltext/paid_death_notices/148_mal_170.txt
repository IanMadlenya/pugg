        SMITHSON-Simon, 41. Of New York City. Loving husband of Susan Kang and devoted father of Natalie and Aaron, found peace from cancer on May 10, 1999. Simon graduated from Cambridge University and was a financial analyst for Dresdner, Kleinwort Benson, and Caspian Securities. He had lived and worked in London, Tokyo, Hong Kong and New York, and will be sorely missed by friends all over the world. He had a wide range of deeply held interests about which he was extremely knowledgeable. A lover of music and a voracious reader of modern history, he was also discriminating about food, wine, clothes and Japanese antiques. The most important things in Simon's life were his family, of whom he spoke most proudly, and friends, to whom he was loyal and generous. A memorial service will be held at 1:30PM Sunday, May 16th at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th St., NYC. Contributions in his memory may be made to support head and neck cancer research: Columbia University, Dept. of Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery, c/o Lydia Reverton, Administrator; or Dr. Lanny Garth Close, Chairman, 630 West 108th Street, New York, NY 10032.
