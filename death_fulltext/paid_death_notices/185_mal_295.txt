        BERNSTEIN-Sumner Thurman. Bernstein, Shur, Sawyer & Nelson (Portland, Maine) acknowledges with great sadness the death of our extraordinary founding partner, Sumner Thurman Bernstein. He was a towering presence in the firm and in the community. He represented ''Kings'', he represented ordinary people; they each received the same high quality of legal service and human respect. His gifts were substantial. He used them for good purposes every day of his life. We will miss him greatly. We extend our condolences to his wife, Rosalyne Spindel Bernstein, to his son, Andrew J. Bernstein, his daughter, Beth B. Schneider, their spouses and their children. Leonard M. Nelson, Senior Partner Peter J. Rubin, President Gregory A. Tselikis Managing Partner
