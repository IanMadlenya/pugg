        TOOMIM--David. The Union for Reform Judaism mourns with profound sorrow the death of David Toomim of Houston, TX, a longtime member and, since 2004, an honorary member of its Board of Trustees. In a variety of roles, David served the Union with great distinction. We extend deepest condolences to his wife, Shirley, and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem and may David's memory be for a blessing. Robert M. Heller, Chairman Rabbi Eric H. Yoffie, President
