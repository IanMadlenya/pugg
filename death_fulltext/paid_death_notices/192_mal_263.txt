        ASHINOFF - Larry. I am deeply saddened by the passing of my dear friend and client, Larry Ashinoff. For over thirty years, we traveled the road of life together and were planning to do so for many more years. Although Larry never bought the boat of his dreams, he will always be a captain to me. My condolences are extended to Carol, Susan, Charles, Lisa and David. Donald Hecht
