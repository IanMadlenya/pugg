        SILFEN-Daniel W. Dr. We are deeply saddened by the loss of our dear friend, Dr. Dan. He was an important part of our lives for nearly 60 years. He was the loving husband of his late wife Milli and we shared a wonderful, caring friendship with them. We extend our deepest sympathy to his sons Eric and Michael and their wives Marilyn and Lucy, to his adored grandchildren and his dear sister Selma. He was a gentle, soft-spoken man and we shall treasure his memory as we treasured his life. Helene and Bernie Axelrod
