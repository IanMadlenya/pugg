        FELICIANO-Richard. Richard was a wonderful colleague of ours for many years. With his effortless smile and easy going manner, Richard was a pleasure to work with. Richard had a way of putting everyone at ease-even upset callers were soon soothed by Richard's friendly approach. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Marina, Jasmine, Ruben, Elena and Peter. He will be missed terribly. The Hudson Companies, Inc.
