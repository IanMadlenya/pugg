        WIGLER--S. Charles. The School of American Ballet family mourns the death of Charlie Wigler, a good and faithful friend for many years. A font of NYC information, an outspoken critic for dance and opera, the teller of thousands of ballet stories, he was the unofficial godfather to hundreds of SAB students and staff members. We shall miss him sorely.
