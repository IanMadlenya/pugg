        BETHEL-C. Mark. Sailor, sandhog, jeweler and entrepreneur, died on February 8, at the age of 72. Mark Bethel combined a lifelong love for reading with the grit of a compressed air worker, fine craftsmanship and the practical acumen of a successful businessman. His presence will be missed but his impression is indelible. A daughter, son, three sisters, two brothers and three grandchildren survive him.
