        VARGA-Joseph G. My father, beloved husband of Gay for 52 years and truly caring father to Grant and me, died on July 16, 1997 in Spring Lake, New Jersey. He savored and enjoyed every second of his 79 years and anyone who ever met him was touched by and never forgot him. He was Senior Vice President and National Advertising Director at Army Times Publishing Company in New York before his retirment in 1988 after 22 years of dedicated, enthusiastic service. Dad, I will miss you deeply but you will always be with me in more ways than you would ever have known. Scott
