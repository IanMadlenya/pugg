While vacationing in Martha's Vineyard, she was in a traffic accident, and was reported dead at the Martha's Vineyard Hospital shortly after. She is survived by her parents, Zeljko and Katarina Matutinovic, of Zagreb, Croatia. Zeljka, a native of Croatia, was a beloved friend to many and a highly accomplished professional. She earned a PhD degree in electrical engineering from Princeton University and had started her career at McKinsey & Co. Zeljka established a career in investment banking working at Credit Suisse First Boston, International Real Returns LLC, and most recently, Jerusalem Venture Partners. Since 2005 she had been working to build her own investment firm. Zeljka will be remembered for her sharp mind, generous heart, and the vibrant love of life. Her interests extended far beyond the business world, and included skiing, sailing and biking. She also took pleasure in opera and art. Zeljka's bright smile was matched by her warmth and infectious enthusiasm. She will be sorely missed by her family and friends. The funeral service will be held in Zagreb, Croatia on July 12th. The memorial mass will be held on Tuesday July 18th, 7pm at St. Cyril Catholic Church, at 502 West 41st Street in NYC.
