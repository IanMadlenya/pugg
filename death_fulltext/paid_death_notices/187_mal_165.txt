        KALLMAN - Malcolm B., known as Matt, 73, died April 4, 2002, at home in Portland, Maine. A charming, tough and singularly complicated man, he loved politics, jazz and good conversation. His vibrant blue eyes, deep tan and wry humor sparked his enormous, ebullient presence. Born in Brighton Beach, he cherished New York. Starting as a buyer for Ohrbach's, he became general merchandise manager for the Boston Store, executive VP of Shillito's, president of Gimbels Pittsburgh, and president & chief executive for Gimbels New York. A memorial was held April 15 at Trinity Cemetery, NYC. Survived by daughter, Lisa; sons, Matthew H. & Dave, and four grandchildren. Donations may be made to the ACLU.
