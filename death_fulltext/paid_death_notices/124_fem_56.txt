        RANGELL-Anita, of Los Angeles, died on April 27 at the age of 81, following a brief, tumultuous struggle against a sudden, rapidlyadvancing malignancy of the brain. Born in Brooklyn, NY, Sept. 18, 1915, she married Leo Rangell Feb. 22, 1939. The two left their New York life via the Air Force during World War II, and relocated to the West Coast in 1946 following the War. Her husband went on to become a scientific and organizational leader in the field of psychoanalysis, holding positions up to the Presidency of the International Psychoanalytic Association in the 60's and 70's. Active throughout the world at the side of her husband, who continued as an Honorary Officer of the International, Anita has been loved and admired as a psychoanalytic ambassador, as well as for her own scholarly and wise insights, for over four decades. Besides her immersion at the acme of the field of psychoanalysis, Anita was also in the vanguard of the world of art. A docent at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art since 1975, and of the Hammer Museum since its inception, she was known for her prodigious store of information and her generosity in sharing it with others. Besides her husband, Anita leaves three children, Judith (Mrs. Louis G. Alley), Susan (Mrs. Wm. Harris) and Paul (Emily) Rangell, seven grandchildren, and a sister. She was pre-deceased by her son Richard, who died at the age of twenty-eight in 1977.
