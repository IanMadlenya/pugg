        BERGMAN-Charlotte. A woman of valor passed away at her home in Jerusalem on July 17, 2002 after an extended illness. Charlotte exemplified a unique combination of dignity, philanthropy and enthusiastic advocacy of the arts together with love and respect for her extended family of numerous friends and fellow art enthusiasts. She, together with her husband Louis, of blessed memory traveled extensively throughout the world pursuing their love of art. Charlotte became known as a hostess par excellence to patrons of the arts among others in Jerusalem. Her regal personality, advocacy of the arts and support of Israel and its cultural and medical institutions epitomized a life of rare values to be emulated. Sanford L. Batkin Seymour N. Chesir
