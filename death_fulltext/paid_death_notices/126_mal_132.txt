        BELLIN-Lowell E., M.D. New York Community Hospital mourns the loss of Lowell E. Bellin, M.D., Physician, New York City Commissioner of Health, New York City Health Services Administrator, Chairman of the Division of Health Services Administration at Columbia University School of Public Health, and professor and teacher at many colleges and universities in the New York metropolitan area. He will be sorely missed by all. Dr. Bellin was a giant among men. He helped young people, colleagues, and all those who were fortunate to have become associated with him. Dr. Bellin was truly devoted to his family, friends, students, colleagues, and the community. In addition, his devotion extended to people from all walks of life with his greatest love being that of teacher. Many of our country's leading health services administrators of today are forever indebted to Dr. Bellin for his guidance, support, and tutelage. Lin H. Mo, President and Chief Executive Officer New York Community Hospital.
