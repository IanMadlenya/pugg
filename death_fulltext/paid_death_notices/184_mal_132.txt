        BURGOYNE-John. The Gamesmen mourn the death of John Burgoyne, friend and gentle man. He was our designated listener, whose comments, rarely offered, carried great weight. Our deepest sympathy to Jane, Andy, Liz and Wayne, Pam and Tim, Jennie, and Jake and Leslie. ''The best of thoughts which man hath known,/ For lack of listeners are not said.''
