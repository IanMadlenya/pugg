Her husband, David, and brothers, Al and Murray, were always in her thoughts. She exuded warmth and was admired for the way she ran her household. Her recipes are cherished and consistently reappear at holiday meals. Services Wednesday, April 17, 1 PM, ''The Riverside,'' 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. In lieu of flowers, donations in her memory to the American Cancer Society, or the ALS Foundation will be appreciated.
