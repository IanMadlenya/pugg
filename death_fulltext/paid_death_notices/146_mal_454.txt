        GERMAIN - Lawrence, who passed away March 24th, 1991. A husband is a special gift. One you think will stay. You never think the day will come When he is called away. God looked around his garden And saw an empty space. He then looked down from heaven And saw your kindly face. He put his arms around you And whispered, ''Come and rest.'' His garden must be beautiful. He only takes the best. Have you ever lost a husband Who meant the world to you The one you loved so dearly And miss him like I do. If you have never had that feeling Then I pray you never do For when God takes your husband He takes a part of you. A shadow walks beside me Forever by my side Always there to guide me Ever since you died. And now it's your anniversary, Lawrence It's up to God above To tell you how much I miss you And give you all my love. Sadly missed by your loving wife, Sheila
