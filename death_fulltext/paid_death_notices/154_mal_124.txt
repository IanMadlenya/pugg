        STONE-Lauson. The entire Long Island College Hospital family mourns the passing of Lauson Stone, our esteemed friend, colleague and benefactor. Mr. Stone was a member of the LICH Board of Regents for over 30 years, serving as Co-Chair of the Board of Regents Nominating Committee, as well as serving as a Vice President for Legal Affairs. He was also a generous supporter of the hospital, whose contributions helped expand and improved patient care services. In recognition of his philanthropic commitment to LICH, the Amity Street entrance to the hospital is named in his honor. His support and friendship will always be remembered. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his family and all who loved him. John Wren, Chairman Board of Regents Allan Gibofsky, MD, JD President & CEO Jagdish Gupta, MD, President, Medical Board
