        KATZ-Leanne G. We lost a beautiful mother, wife and friend on Sunday night, March 2, 1997 after a three year struggle with cancer. She was loved by her family, her friends and all those in the National Coalition Against Censorship and First Amendment community and will be mourned, we know, by all those fortunate enough to have known her. We list the names of her close family, but we know there is a multitude who could also be mentioned who will carry her memory, her husband Alvin Katz, sons Joseph and Jamie Katz, Lisa Nocera, sister Sara Blackburn and Jeff Snider.
        KATZ-Leanne. People everywhere will sorely Miss Leanne Katz, the beloved, gentle but tough-minded about censorship, dynamic, and vital Executive Director of The National Coalition Aganist Censorship. She devoted her life to helping us understand that free expression is a human right and that, everyone, especially the disadvantaged, benefits from the broadest exchange of ideas, creativity and inquiry. As she expressed for NCAC, nothing is more important than the right to read, to know, to see and to hear, and to speak and to think for oneself.
