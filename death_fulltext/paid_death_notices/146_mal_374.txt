        SHAPIRO-Jeffrey R., Hazzan. The Cantors Assembly records with sorrow the passing of a revered colleague of more than two and a half decades. A graduate of the former Cantors Institute, now the H.L. Miller Cantorial School of the J.T.S.A., he served as Cantor in New Bedford, Ma., Syosset, N.Y. and in Cherry Hill, N.J. His kindness, his humanity and his caring inspired us all. We extend our sympathy to his wife Theodora, children and his loved ones. May his memory abide as a blessing. Hazzan Henry Rosenblum, President Hazzan Stephen J. Stein, Executive Vice Pres Hazzan Abraham B. Shapiro, Executive Administrator
