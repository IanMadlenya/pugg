        WHITNEY--Frances J. Died peacefully on November 29, 2005 at the Mary Manning Walsh Home in Manhattan. An artist and designer her entire life, in 1939 she invented the ''millinery mobile''. In the 1960's she was one of the first artists to create the exhibit ''Body Sculpture''. In the early 70's she invented and held a patent on ''Sculptured Light'', a plastic-encased electroluminescent tape molded by heat. The last 20 years of her working life were devoted to collaboration with the renowned laser artist, Norman Ballard, experimenting with lasers, video, and relationship between sound and shape. Her work was extensively exhibited both in the USA and abroad from the 1940's through 2002. From 1992 through 2004 she was cared for in her home by her daughter, Colette with her fiance James Johnson. Their love and support enabled her to continue creating and exhibiting her art through her 2002 retrospective at the Century Association. She will be deeply missed. She is survived by her daughter, Colette Whitney, her sister Theodora Taggart, her niece, Patricia Lannon and her nephews William and James Lannon. A memorial service will be held at 11 AM on Monday December 12, at the Mary Manning Walsh Home Chapel, 1339 York Ave., at 72nd St.
