        PLOWS - Grace Marian Smith. With sadness at the loss, yet with thankfulness for the gift of 95 years of life, the family of Grace Marian Smith Plows announces her passing on June 13, 2002. Brooklyn born in 1907, she was an enthusiastic city resident for nine decades before moving to a Stamford, CT, retirement home four years ago. For more than 65 years she pursued her passion for books as a librarian in NYC high schools, at St. John's University, at the Watson Library of the Metropolitan Museum of Art (where she volunteered for more than two decades), and, over the past four years, in the library of the retirement community where she lived. She is survived by her two sons, William and Robert, two grandchildren, Jonathan and Julie, three great - grandchildren, Andrew, Erica and Ronald, and many friends, young and old. A Manhattan memorial service is being planned for later this month. The family prefers that any remembrance be in the form of a charitable contribution to The Metropolitan Museum of ArtGrace Plows Fund, 1000 Fifth Avenue, N.Y., New York 10028. Any such gift will be used to support the Watson Library at the Museum.
