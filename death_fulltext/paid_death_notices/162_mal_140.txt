        DRIVER-William. The faculty, staff, students and alumni of Bard College mourn the passing of William Driver, Professor Emeritus of Theatre, who retired last year after 40 years of distinguished service to the College. Under his leadership, the drama/dance program at Bard flourished and became a centerpiece of the college's traditions. His tireless devotion to his students and to his high artistic ideals made him a charismatic mentor for generations of Bard graduates. His fire, elegance, and brilliance will be sorely missed.
