        MILLER--Rosetta A. June 23, 1935-February 18, 2007. We mourn the passing of Rosetta Averil Miller, beloved wife of thirty years of Samuel C. ''Sam'' Miller, Director Emeritus of The Newark Museum, Newark, New Jersey. A native of South Carolina, Mrs. Miller was well known in theatrical circles and in the art world as the consummate hostess, one who never forgot a name or a personal association. She enthusiastically embraced the City of Newark and its civic culture, especially its museum. She assisted her husband in raising the then unheard of sum of $23 million for The Newark Museum's Master Plan Renovation by Michael Graves in 1989. A memorial service in New York City will be announced shortly. Contributions in memory of Rosetta A. Miller may be made to The Newark Museum Association, 49 Washington Street, Newark, NJ 07102.
        MILLER--Rosetta. The Board and staff of the World Monuments Fund are deeply saddened at the sudden loss on Saturday, February 17, of Rosetta Miller, the beloved wife of our longtime trustee Sam Miller. Inimitable and full of life, Rosetta lit up any room she entered. The party did not begin until she and Sam arrived. One of the most enthusiastic supporters of our preservation work in Angkor, Cambodia, Rosetta led her friends on visits to review the progress, and began WMFs Adopt a Garuda program to support local training and conservation work at Angkor. The first monumental Garuda at Angkor to be adopted, Rosetta Garuda, was named for her. WMF is deeply appreciative of her endorsement of our work around the world and of the generous and irrepressible spirit she brought to every aspect and every moment of her life. We will sorely miss her. A memorial service is being planned by her family. We send our deepest sympathy and love to Sam and the family. Bonnie Burnham, President, the World Monuments Fund; Marilyn Perry, Board Chair; the Board, and all the staff of WMF across the globe.
