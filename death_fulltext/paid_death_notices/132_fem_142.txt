She is also survived by two loving grandchildren Adam and Jennifer; her adoring extended family Michael and Carol; five grandchildren and one great-grandchild. Funeral services will be held 10AM Sunday, January 18 at ''The Riverside'', 76 Street and Amsterdam Avenue, Manhattan. In lieu of flowers kindly send donations to your favorite charity.
