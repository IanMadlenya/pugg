        WIMPFHEIMER-Ruth. The officers, Board of Directors and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Ruth Wimpfheimer, a cherished friend, who expressed her commitment to Jewish and other humanitarian causes through her generosity on behalf of our Women's Campaign. Mrs. Wimpfheimer's husband, Kurt, is also deeply devoted to the Jewish community. He has been a longtime leader in the UJA-Federation community of caring. We extend our deepest sympathies to Kurt; to Mrs. Wimpfheimer's son, Steven, and his wife, Ruth; to her daughter, Judith Bodie, and her husband, Zvi; to her five grandchildren; and to the entire Wimpfheimer family. Larry Zicklin, President Morris W. Offit, Chair of the Board John S. Ruskay, Exec VP & CEO Joan Ginsburg, Women's Campaign Chair
