        BAKER-Roberta. We are deeply saddened at the passing of Roberta Deal Baker of Woodhaven, NY, on May 20, 1998. She was the beloved daughter of Dr. A. W. and Gladys Deal of Lewistown, MT, and the loving wife of the late Raleigh Baker. She is survived by her loving children, grandchildren and two sisters. A spirited and generous person, Cissie performed in jazz bands as a young woman, was a highly decorated Army officer in the First WAAC outfit and an accomplished craftsperson featured in national magazines and local television. A philanthropist and animal lover, she supported the work of the Humane Society and donated numerous hours to visting shut-ins. In lieu of flowers, donations to the Humane Society would be appreciated.
