        ANKER-Irving. I had the privilege and honor of working with Irving Anker on a daily basis for three years as his attorney at the Board of Education. He was the most honest, decent and caring human being I have ever worked with. Through crisis after crisis his paramount concern was always the children. My condolences to the family. Robert S.
