        BACH-Ida L. The Offices, Directors, Management and Staff of Metropolitan Jewish Health System sadly mourn the passing of Ida L. Bach, honorary board member, esteemed supporter, and dear friend. Ida was deeply dedicated to serving the elderly and was an inspiration to others through her selfless acts of devotion. She was a long time officer and treasurer of the Flatbush League, which later became known as the Town League, and served many years as a member of the board of Directors of Metropolitan Jewish Geriatric Center. Beloved wife of the late Reuben H. Bach, her long years of service and devotion will be remembered always. We extend our sincere condolences and deepest sympathies to her family and friends.
