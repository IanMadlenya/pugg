        SELIGSON-David J., Dr., died on August 3, 1999, of a brief illness in his native New York City. His discerning wisdom, love of God, and abiding faith in the beauty and goodness of human beings will be missed beyond measure. His intelligence, spirit and fortitude will inspire us and give us strength, as he has inspired so many in his 92 years-as Rabbi of Central Synagogue, spirtual leader far and wide, Chaplain and Lieutenant Colonel, U.S. Army, and as our own beloved father and grandfather. Services will be held at Central Synagogue Community House, 123 East 55 St., on Friday, August 6, at Noon. Contributions may be made in his name to the Rebuilding Fund of Central Synagogue.
