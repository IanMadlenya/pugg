        SCHOENBACH-Sol. The trustees and staff of the Philadelphia Chamber Music Society express their deepest sympathy to the family of Sol Schoenbach. Since the Society's founding Dr. Schoenbach was a valued member of the board. Through his wise counsel, his musical expertise, his experience as an educator, and his enthusastic encouragement he played a vital role in developing and nurturing this organization. He will be dearly missed and fondly remembered by us all.
