        NITCHUN--Phyllis. Beloved cousin of Mary Astor and Shirley Vorspan. Cherished by a large and loving extended family as a speech language therapist and diagnostician with the NYC Board of Education, she devoted her career to working with children in the NYC public schools. She will be remembered fondly by many colleagues and by a circle of close friends who shared her life. In her last years she was attended with warmth and tenderness by her family and caregivers Joanne Cuenca and Mila Rosario as well as the nurses and staff at the Mary Manning Walsh Home. May the memory of this good woman be a blessing. Services Wednesday, 12:45 PM at ''The Riverside'', 76th Street and Amsterdam Ave.
