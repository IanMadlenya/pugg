        KOSAK--Alvin. The faculty and staff of NYU's Department of Chemistry note with sorrow the passing of Alvin Kosak. Dr. Kosak came to the Department of Chemistry as an Associate Professor in 1955. He later served as Chairman of the department for over 15 years, ending his tenure as chair in 1977 when he was promoted to Acting Dean for the Faculty of Arts and Science. He was a distinguished researcher, passionate teacher and a highly regarded colleague who gave this department forty years of dedicated service. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his entire family.
