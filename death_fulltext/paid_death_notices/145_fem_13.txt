        ROSENFIELD - Joan (Brown). January 30, 1999, of Foster City, CA. (formerly of Valley Cottage, N.Y., and the Bronx). Mourned by her husband, two sons, mother, brother, daughter-in-law, sister-inlaw, niece, nephew, 22 first cousins and countless friends everywhere. An extraordinary person much loved by all. Her husband Ted, sons Howard and Jonathan with Jennifer were at her side. After graduating from James Monroe HS at 15, she went to Hunter College (when it was still good) and went on to become a kindergarten teacher in the NYC school system. After the birth of her two boys, she was a teacher in the Valley Cottage school and then came back to the NYC schools. She was a truly good person. Roy and Jane Brown
