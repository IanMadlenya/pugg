        FULTON--Robert Edison, was one of the most interesting men I have ever known. He was a philosopher, musician, poet, director, cinematographer, aerial cinematographer, filmmaker and, most of all, an incredible man. Bob was highly skilled in all these areas. He won many awards including an Emmy for his work. He was a devout Buddhist. Bob was extremely humble and never talked about himself or his accomplishments, but only about the love of his work. Bob did everything in such a unique way that his friends and family referred to his lifestyle as Fultonian, as if he had developed an entirely different culture and way of life. To tell one's story about Bob was never enough, people always wanted to hear more and know more about this fascinating man. To watch Bob fly a plane was like watching a virtuoso playing an instrument. He taught me many things, both in the sky and on the ground. His lessons of ''point of intended touchdown'' is something I will never forget. A wonder with words, Fulton never used profanity; he thought it was an abuse of the English language and demonstrated a lack of a proper vocabulary. I miss my generous mentor and good friend, Bob Fulton, who is in my thoughts every day. Taz Saunders
