        FARMAN-Hans. The board and staff of the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation mourn the death of Hans Farman on August 25th at age 93 at his home in Old Greenwich, CT. The brother of Anni Albers, he played a vital role in making possible the growth of the Albers Foundation through his determined pursuit of family reparations in re-unified Berlin. We will miss his warmth, his unfailing wit, his remarkable insightfulness, and his friendship. Our condolences go to his devoted children, Joanna, Ned, and Connie, and to their families.
