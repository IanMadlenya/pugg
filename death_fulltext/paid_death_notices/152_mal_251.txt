        BROWNSTEIN-Philip. We mourn the passing of our beloved friend and Block Island comrade. For 45 years, he enriched our lives with his charming warmth, his humor, and his quietly blazing intellect. Goodness, integrity and a rare unshakable decency were his hallmarks. His life of dedication to our shared values was an inspiration. His going is a tear in the fabric of our lives, but the memories of summer laughter, gardens, and starlight on the ocean will be with us always. Zenith, Katherine, Peter, Kenneth, Melinda, Larry, Rose, and the grandchildren
