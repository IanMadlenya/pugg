        SHAPIRO-Sol. On March 6, 2002 we lost a great man who succeeded in every possible way. He is survived by his beloved wife Helen, adoring children Linda and husband Milton, Robert and wife Sharon, cherished grandchildren Douglas and wife Lisa, Daniel, Jacqueline, Michael, and great grandchild Andrew. Also survived by devoted sister Sylvia. A retired Executive of the William Morris Agency, whose career span over four decades. He was a trusted confidant and agent to some of the world's greatest entertainers. A man of tremendous generosity, selflessness and honesty who will be deeply missed by his family and friends.
