        CONE-Peggy L. The music world mourns the loss of New York jazz icon, Peggy Cone. Bandleader, swing dancer, singer, and composer, Peggy passed away at her home in New York City on February 5th, due to liver cancer. She is survived by her beloved sister, Carol Cone, and her brotherin-law, Harry Silverman of Weston, MA, and her two cats, Willow and Miso. Peggy was heralded as an innovator of the New Swing movement and combined her flair for fashion with the melodies written during the ''Big Band Era.'' She delighted audiences with her strong voice, over the top style, and elegant vintage clothing and accessories from her vast collection. With her group, Peggy Cone and The Central Park Stompers, they recorded 4 cd's, including one that is soon to be released entitled, ''Looking for Yesterday.'' In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent in memory of Peggy Cone to Against All Odds (a liver cancer research foundation), PO Box 6046, Nashua, New Hampshire 03063, Attention: Jerry Caplan.
