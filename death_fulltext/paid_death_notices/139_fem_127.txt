        GLICK-Sylvia. The administrators and staff of the Advanced Center for Psychotherapy mourn the passing of our friend, Sylvia Glick. For nearly 40 years, her devotion to the clinic and her high standards set a mark for all of us to match. The clinic will be a lesser place without her. We extend condolences to Harry and her family.
