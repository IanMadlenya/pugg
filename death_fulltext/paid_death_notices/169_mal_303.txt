        FRIEDHOFF-Arnold J. M.D. A dedicated pioneer in the field of biological psychiatry, prolific writer, internationally honored, the Director of The Jonas Center for the Study and Treatment of Children at Risk at NYU Medical School; but most of all, an empathic teacher and valued friend. We extend our deepest sympathy to the family. He will be sorely missed. Barbara and Donald Jonas
