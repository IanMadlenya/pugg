        SPENGLER-Silas. The Yale College Class of 1953 mourns the loss of our most esteemed and beloved classmate. Si was our leader and class secretary for almost 40 years. His wisdom, humanity, good humor, and gentlemanly kindness were the hallmarks of a man of rare character. We extend our sympathy and support to his wife Sandy, and to his family.
        SPENGLER-Silas. Over more than 50 years, you were a wonderful friend, a wonderful partner and a very special human being. We will always miss you and never forget you. Our most sincere condolences to Sandy, Si and Harry. Micky and Jeanny
        SPENGLER-Silas. You were the glue that put the team together and stayed the course for almost 30 years, from 200 Park to 280 Park and, of course, the Board Room. Safe journey, Si. Mike, Bob and Ken
