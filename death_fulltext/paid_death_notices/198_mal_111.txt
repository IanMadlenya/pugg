        GANNES--Abraham, a renowned pioneer in Jewish education, teacher, scholar and dear father, grandfather, great-grandfather and friend, died on July 8 (8 Tammuz). Dr. Gannes was the last in the galaxy of Jewish luminaries who established the foundation and built the structure for modern Jewish education, including a network of Jewish schools and cultural institutions, in the United States and Canada. Dr. Gannes was the former Executive Director of the Department of Education and Culture-American Section of the WZO, Executive Director of Cejwin Camps, Executive Director of the Council of Jewish Education (Philadelphia), and founder and Executive Director of the Bureau of Jewish Education (Miami). His passion for Jewish learning influenced thousands during his 75 years as a Jewish educator. The Jewish world will greatly miss Dr. Gannes' ongoing contribution to strengthening Jewish education, values and life. His loving children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren deeply mourn their personal loss.
