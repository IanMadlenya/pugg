        SOMMERS-Bonnie Alden. Adored wife and best friend to Jim, incomparable mother and inspiration to Allison and Roger, of cancer on July 9, 2000. Her warmth and vitality will be sorely missed by her family, her cherished friends, and the colleagues of a life-long career in film, TV and the Broadway theatre. Plans for a memorial celebration will be announced at a later date. SOMMERS-Bonnie Alden. Good actress, good person, good friend. She loved life and gave it a zest. Exciting, feisty, just wonderful. My early love and my late love. Jimmy, Alison and Roger, my heart is with you. M.A.
