        LOEWENSTEIN-Benjamin S. The American Jewish Committee is deeply saddened by the death of our dear friend Benjamin Loewenstein. Ben was a devoted member of our National Board of Governors for more than 40 years and a beloved member of two AJC chapters. In Philadelphia, he served as Chairman of the Board, and as a successful attorney since 1937, he worked diligently to open the doors of local law firms and banks to Jewish professionals. In Palm Beach County, he served on numerous committees to improve the Jewish condition and the human condition and, along with his wife Eleanor, was recently honored with the chapter's Founders Award. Ben was a man of great compassion, warmth and human kindness. We will miss his gentle nature and his wise counsel. We send our sincere condolences to Eleanor, his children, stepchildren and grandchildren. Harold Tanner, President David A. Harris, Exec. Dir. Shulamith Bahat, Assoc. Exec. Dir.
