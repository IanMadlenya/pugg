        BAMBERGER--Ethel (Pat). Our entire congregation is saddened to record the death of a woman who has been an important and devoted member of the Temple Shaaray Tefila community for over 60 years. Along with her beloved late husband, Rabbi Bernard J. Bamberger Z''l, Mrs. Bamberger served our congregation from 1944 to 1971. She was involved in many aspects of our congregation's life and activities. We extend heartfelt condolences to her sons, Rabbi Henry Bamberger and David Bamberger and their entire family. May they be comforted along with all our people's mourners in Zion and Jerusalem. Rabbi Jonathan A. Stein Michael H. Laufer, President
