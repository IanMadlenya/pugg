        BRENNAN-William J. 1906-1997. Justice Brennan's eloquent opinion, upholding New York's designation of Grand Central Terminal as a landmark, saved not only one of our City's greatest buildings, but our Landmarks Law, itself. He laid to rest the notion that private property rights and the public good cannot be faithfully and fairly balanced. We attempted to honor Justice Brennan by awarding him our President's Medal in 1991. By accepting it, he honored us. The Municipal Art Society of New York
        BRENNAN-William J. Retired Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan was a giant. He contributed as much to the cause of civil liberties as any other person in our history. He brought to the Court a unique combination of principle, passion, personality and political savvy. Every American owes him a huge debt. The ACLU sends its deepest condolences to his family. Nadine Strossen, President Ira Glasser, Executive Director American Civil Liberties Union
