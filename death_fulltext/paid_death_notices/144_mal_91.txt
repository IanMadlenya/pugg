        PAOLUCCI-Henry. The City College of New York mourns the passing of Dr. Henry Paolucci, a distinguished alumnus of CCNY's Class of 1950. A noted scholar who taught ancient Greek and Roman history at CCNY and other leading colleges, he was also a prolific author and an important voice in politics and public policy. On behalf of the City College community I wish to extend my heartfelt condolences to his wife, CUNY Board of Trustees Chairwoman Dr. Anne A. Paolucci, and to his family. Yolanda T. Moses, President The City College of New York/ CUNY
