        TAFT--Mary Jane, 76. Died peacefully in her sleep early in the morning on May 6 at her home in Waleska, Georgia, after a courageous battle with emphysema and cancer. An artist and animal lover, she was the widow of Horace Taft, a physics professor at and former Dean of Yale University, who passed away in 1983. Born May 15, 1930 in New York City, she lived in Switzerland from 1933 until 1952, where her mother, Mary Bancroft, worked as a journalist and served as an intelligence agent under Allen Dulles during World War II. Over several decades in the Yale University community, Mrs. Taft exhibited as a visual artist, was co-founder of and volunteer at the Connecticut Ballet, and assisted her husband in his various administrative roles including those of Dean of Yale College and Master of Davenport residential college. Mrs. Taft moved to the Atlanta (GA) area in 1985 and lived during the last years of her life on her farm in Waleska, with dozens of pets and animals that she befriended and adopted over the years. She is survived by her three sons, John, of Minneapolis (MN), Hugh, of Takoma Park (MD) and Horace, of Minneapolis (MN) and four grandsons and four granddaughters. Memorial services will be held on her farm in Waleska, Georgia on June 3, at 2:00 PM, and in New Haven (CT) on June 24, time and place to be announced. The family requests that, in lieu of flowers, memorials be sent to the Cherokee County Humane Society in Canton (GA). For more information, contact Sosebee Funeral Home, Canton, Georgia.
