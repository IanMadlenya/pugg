        MERKIN--Ursula. The Yeshiva University family laments the passing of an elegant, yet humble, extraordinary Jewish matriarch, the wife of the late Hermann Merkin, who was a Vice Chairman of the YU Board of Trustees and with her, a YU Benefactor. A woman of great compassion, kindness and warmth, she was deeply concerned with the requirements of the needy and the elderly. The daughter of the well known philosopher and author Isaac (and Jenny) Breuer she and her husband named YU's Isaac Breuer College of Hebraic Studies in his memory. Heartfelt condolences are extended to her devoted children: Dinah (and Andrew) Mendes; Deborah (and Lewis) Gerber; RIETS and YU Trustee, J. Ezra (and Lauren) Merkin, YU Benefactors; Daphne Merkin; Solomon Nehemiah (and Sharon) Merkin; Rabbi David (and Rebecca) Merkin and to her siblings: Yaakov Baror, Prof. Mordechai (and Simcha) Breuer and Tzipora Meyer, and to her many grandchildren and her great-grandchildren. May the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel, President Dr. Norman Lamm Chancellor Morry J.
