        SIEGEL--Alan. Age 89, after a brief illness. Beloved husband of the late Lois Ringel Siegel. Cherished father of Lee Siegel (Alan Levande) and the late Mark F. Siegel. Adored grandfather of Mark and Laura Levande. Loving brother of the late Anne Sanders, and brother-in-law of Victor and Marie Ringel and Ellen and Martin Richman. The world has lost a very special man of extraordinary integrity and empathy who loved and devoted himself to his family. A wonderful teacher and mentor, and a diehard supporter of those less fortunate, he was loved, admired and appreciated by so many whose lives he touched. Alan's gentle kindness and compassion and his quiet generosity will be remembered and cherished in our hearts forever. Donations in Alan's memory may be made to the American Cancer Society. Memorial services will be private.
