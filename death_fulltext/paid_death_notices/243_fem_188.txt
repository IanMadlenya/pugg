        MUKHADZE--Nana. On May 2, at 2pm at the Columbarium of the Cathedral of St. John Divine there will be a memorial gathering to mark the one year anniversary of Nana Mukhadze's tragic death. Her grieving mother and brother, her many loving friends, and the public that was inspired by her pianism continue to miss her terribly.
