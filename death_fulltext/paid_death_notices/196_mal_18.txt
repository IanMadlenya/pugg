        MILLER-Elliot. All of us at The League Treatment Center mourn our gentle, good friend Elliot Miller. An artist and sculptor himself, Elliot saw potential within each person regardless of their handicap. With his guidance and vision, he enabled each one to create stunning works of art. Elliot changed the lives of all of us who loved him. Our deepest sympathy goes to his beloved wife, Joanne and his sister Karen. Dr. Steven E. Katz, Board President and all the members of the Board of Directors, and Hannah A. Kinn, Executive Director and all of the staff of The League Treatment Center
