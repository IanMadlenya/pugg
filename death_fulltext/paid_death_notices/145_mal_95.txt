        MOREHEAD-Gould. August 22, 1927-January 21, 1999. Born and raised in Montclair, NJ, he lived to see the world. Learned in classrooms, clubhouses and kitchens far and near, he lived to teach his grandchildren to think big picture. Sharing in the sorrows of life, he lived to share a laugh at himself. Stubborn believer in an open mind, he lived always on his terms. Proud with the potential to boast of greatness, he lived in the quiet illumination of humility. Haunted by the human ghosts of fear and regret, he lived with the love of such the life he was blessed with. Wishing to keep his family close, he is survived by four children and four grandchildren who will now come together more often. He will be missed, but he is at peace wherever he is.
