        LONGOBARDI-Violet, 91, on July 25, 2001. With profound sorrow, our community mourns the loss of Violet, a founding board member of the Mary McDowell Center for Learning and our constant inspiration. Her commitment to creating a school in Brooklyn to nurture children with special needs, support their parents and serve the community touched everyone who knew her. We looked to her keen intelligence and honesty to meet our challenges and her warmth to transform us into an extended family. Her friendship, love and zest for life will remain the model for us all. The Board, Faculty, Staff, Students and Parents of the Mary McDowell Center for Learning
