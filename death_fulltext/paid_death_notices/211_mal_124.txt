        BROWN--David Edward, on August 8, 2004, after a brief illness. Born July 11, 1937, in Boston, MA. David made his home in LA, but was always a New Yorker at heart. He was a nationally known loungewear and robe designer with his own label, supplying fine stores such as Saks and Nordstroms. David was a dynamic business person, a passionate opera lover and Met patron, and a wonderful friend. His lust for life and innumerable kindnesses to all who were lucky enough to have known him will live on in their hearts. No services are planned and donations may be made to the Metropolitan Opera Guild.
