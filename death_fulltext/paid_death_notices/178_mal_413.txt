        NEWMAN-Henry. Boys Town Jerusalem mourns with profound sorrow the passing of a most cherished member of our extended family. Henry Newman was a survivor in every sense of the word. As one who lived through the horrors of the Holocaust he had a keen understanding of the importance of Jewish education, the State of Israel, and Jewish continuity. The care, concern and love he showed for his beloved wife Helen, especially during her recent illness, was extraordinary. The Newmans suffered an irreplaceable loss with the untimely passing of their young son, Steven Mark. At Boys Town, the Newmans saw vibrant youngsters who represented the future of the Jewish people in the State of Israel. They established a major Scholarship Endowment in his name by dedicating the Steven Mark garden in the school's Children's Park, feeling that Steven's life would vicariously be lived by these young boys. We extend heartfelt condolences to his daughter Sylvia Safer and the entire family. Rabbi Moshe Linchner, Dean Josh S. Weston, Hon. Chairman Raphael Benaroya, Chairman Michael J. Scharf, President Rabbi Ronald Gray, Exec. V.P.
