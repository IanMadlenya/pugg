        HIGGINS--Gerry. The President, faculty, staff and students of Borough of Manhattan Community College, and the Board of Directors and staff of the BMCC Foundation, mourn with heavy hearts the death of our colleague and friend, Gerry Higgins. Gerry was a member of the Board of the BMCC Foundation, and a tireless advocate for and supporter of the college and its students. More than that, Gerry was an inspiration to us all: a person who overcame obstacles in life, constantly strove for excellence in his professional and personal endeavors, and lived life to the full. He lived to help others, and the lives he touched and changed for the better are a testimony to the difference he made. Hundreds of disadvantaged young men and women have gone to college because of Gerry's work with the BMCC Foundation. He gave the gift of life itself to countless people by raising awareness of organ donation. We will miss his sound judgment, his good humor, and his great kindness. As a new road now rises to meet Gerry, may God continue to hold him in the hollow of His hand.
