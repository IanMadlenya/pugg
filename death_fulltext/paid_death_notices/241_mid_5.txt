        DESSAU--Saul, beloved exhusband of Bella Dessau, who mourns his loss and the life that they shared. Bella arrived this morning, having flown from Uruguay, to reach New York in time for the funeral. We are all grateful and appreciative of her love and support and find great comfort in having her here to be with us in this time of our great shared loss and sorrow. Robert and Beata Dessau and the entire Dessau Family
