        BLOCK-Morris. The faculty of the Department of Medicine, many of them former students, and all the alumni of the NYU School of Medicine are sorrowed by the demise of Dr. Morris Block, an alumnus and professor of clinical medicine who died at the age of 96. He was a much beloved teacher who established for us high standards for the knowledge and practice of clinical medicine. He taught us to be independent thinkers and compassionate physicians. His legacy is always with us. Saul J. Farber, M.D. Frederick King, Professor of Medicine Chairman, Dept of Medicine, NYU
