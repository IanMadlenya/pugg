        SHEVETT-Robert. Died on March 7, 2002, at 75 years of age. Bob was an extraordinary man who lived his life heartily. He was a profound influence in all of our lives-his wife Barbara Rosenthal, his children Sarah and David Shevett, his grandchildren Josh Barry and Zachary Shevett, and Sasha, Zachary and Jacob Rosenthal, his siblings Janice Shevett, Gershen Shevett, Irene Spoelstra, his nephews Matt, Leon and Morgan, and his niece Holli, and great-nephews Dylan and Sam, and great-niece Paula Rachel, and his many good friends and business associates and acquaintances. Bob will be remembered for his remarkable connection to everyone who was fortunate enough to have known him. An afternoon of memories, music, humor, food and wine will celebrate his life and mourn his death on Sunday, March 10, at 3 PM, at his home.
