With great affection for nieces and nephews Judy and Steve Kamberg, Rhoda and Dave Nathan, Lydia and Mel Kotimsky, Marsha and Ken Blinn, and Joel Zakoff. An alumnus of CCNY, NYU and University of Santa Clara. In retirement, an enrolled agent and tax preparer. He was an avid bridge player, reaching the rank of Life Master. A sports and movie buff, and above all a truly nice, kind man. He will be missed.
