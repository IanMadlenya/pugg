        POST--Sheldon. 9/5/36-6/25/88 Founder, Chelsea Pines Inn. Chair, NYC Gay Men's Chorus. Board, Congregation Beth Simchat Torah. 15 years gone: a moment, a lifetime. As we celebrate Gay Pride this week, we recall those in our community who were lost too soon in the ongoing war against AIDS. Sheldon dreamt of a better world, a world where we could all live and love in harmony, and fought hard to make it happen. He would have shed tears of joy and astonishment to see how far we have come. My cherished companion of seven years, devoted son, brother, uncle, friend, proud to be a gay Jew. Please join Tom Klebba and me as we remember so many others gone too soon: Mark Fuschetti, Peter Monette, Gary Olde, Jon Flaherty, Gary Brubach, Benn Brown and Wayne Kell, Tom Bradley, Garon Douglas, Jay ''Peggy Sue'' Farrar, Dean X Johnson, Allan Kendric and Ron McSwiggen, Bob Levine, Eddie Peters, Quinton Johnson, Norman Sweet, Eddie Tilchen, Martin Teitel. ''And all I ever dreamed I'd be, the best I ever thought of me, was every minute there to see...'' Sheldon, rest well knowing that you and all our friends will be remembered and celebrated as long as we live. Jay Lesige
