        ABRAM-Morris B. The National Conference on Soviet Jewry (NCSJ), its officers, Executive Committee, Board of Governors and staff mourn the loss of our former Chairman, a giant in the Jewish world and leading pioneer for civil rights in the U.S. and human rights worldwide, whose leadership and moral guidance never ceased. He led and inspired the Soviet Jewry movement in the U.S. during one of its most critical phases, from 1983 to 1988. Condolences to his widow, Bruna, and the entire family. Denis C. Braham, Chairman Howard E. Sachs, President Mark B. Levin, Executive Director
