        CASE--Stephen. The entire staff of Rizzoli International Publications mourns the loss of Stephen Case, a highly respected editor and colleague for whom we all had great affection. He will be deeply missed by all who were lucky enough to work with him. Our deepest sympathy is extended to his wife Yvonne Galindo, and both of their families.
