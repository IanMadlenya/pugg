        RUBENSTEIN-Gilbert M. Professor Emeritus of English at Pace University died in Oceanside, NY on March 6th following a courageous struggle with lymphoma. A dedicated teacher to his students, Dr. Rubenstein served as English Dept. Chair, former President of the Faculty Council, and retired in 1994 following 43 years at Pace. He touched many people with his love of the English language. Beloved husband and father, treasured friend, he lived as a mensch who devoted himself to others in the spirit of tikkun olam, repairing the broken vessel of the world. He will be lovingly remembered by his wife of fifty years, Natalie; his children Asa and Fortune, Diane and Phillip, Susan and Carl; his granddaughter Rachel; his sister Pauline and his brother Leo. Memorial Services were held Friday March 7. Contributions can be made to the Pace University English Dept. or to Hadassah.
