        AROND-Irma. Never was there a sister more beloved nor a sister-inlaw more endeared. Irma's uplifting spirit and love of life brought a sparkle of joy to everyone around her. She was resolute, courageous and undaunting. We will miss her so very much. Estelle and Nat Roth
        AROND-Irma. A lady of character and grace, our beloved friend. We cherish the happy times together; your magical laughter will ring within us forever. Gloria and Henry Zeisel and Family
