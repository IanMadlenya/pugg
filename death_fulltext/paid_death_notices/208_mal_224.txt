        WOLSTEIN--Bertram. American Friends of The Hebrew University and The Hebrew University of Jerusalem note with profound sorrow the loss of Bertram L. Wolstein. Bert was committed to Hebrew University and Israel's people. Bert and Iris Wolstein spearheaded the Iris S. and Bert L. Wolstein Accessibility Project, which provides easy physical access to important facilities on the Mount Scopus campus. The Wolstein humanitarian legacy will exist in perpetuity, benefiting future generations. We extend our sympathies to his beloved wife Iris, to children Cheryl W. Faigus and Scott A. Wolstein, and to the entire family. AFHU Ira Lee Sorkin, President Keith L. Sachs, Chairman of the Board Peter T. Willner, Exec. VP
