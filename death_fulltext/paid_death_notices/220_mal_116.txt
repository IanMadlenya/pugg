        MORDECAI -- Benjamin III. We mourn the loss of our Associate Dean and esteemed colleague. A distinguished man of the theatre, Ben was a teacher, mentor, producer and innovator marked by his extraordinary dedication to theatre training and monumental achievements in the American theatre. A tireless enthusiast he will be missed by all who knew him. Our deepest sympathies to his wife Sherry and daughter Rachel.
