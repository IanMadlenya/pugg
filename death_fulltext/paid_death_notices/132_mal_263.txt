The faculty and staff of the Department of Psychiatry of New York University Medical Center and the entire community of New York University School of Medicine wish to express our profound sorrow on the passing of our esteemed colleague, Harold I. Kaplan, on January 15, 1998. Dr. Kaplan, a member of the Department for 17 years, was Professor of Psychiatry at NYU School of Medicine and an Attending Psychiatrist at Bellevue, Tisch and Lenox Hill Hospitals. He was founding editor of the ''Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry'', a major work translated into 11 languages and used by psychiatrists around the world. A brilliant and humane educator, Dr. Kaplan was Life Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association, the American College of Physicians, and the New York Academy of Medicine, and the recipient of numerous awards that recognized extraordinary talents and capabilities. To his wife, Nancy, to his children, Philip, Peter and Jennifer, and to his many patients, we extend our deepest sympathies. Robert Cancro, M.D., Chairman, Dept. of Psychiatry NYU School of Medicine
