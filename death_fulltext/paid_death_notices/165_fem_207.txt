        ZELNER-Marjorie. We mourn the passing of Marjorie Zelner, wife of our friend and business partner Larry Zelner. Marjorie's friendship, integrity, competence and family devotion set an example for all who knew her. May Larry and her son Jonathan draw consolation from the close and loving relationship which they shared. Laurie and Barry Badner
