While still a student at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, she traveled to China to teach in a government school, leaving as the Japanese-Chinese fighting approached the town. Returning to the United States, she completed her B.A. at Carleton and went on to earn an M.A. in International Relations from the University of Chicago and an M.S. in Education from Madison College in Harrisonburg, Virginia. In 1939 she married Haldore Hanson. Together they spent more than 25 years living in Asia. Africa, and South America. Haldore's work in economic development, primarily with the Ford Foundation, took them to Burma, Iran, Pakistan, West Africa, and Mexico. Berni's focus in these countries was on promoting traditional handicrafts. She was involved in developing rural cooperatives to support local artisans and arranging venues in urban areas for artisans to demonstrate and sell their work. She is the author of a book, From the Distaff Side: Fifty Years Around the Third World, describing her experiences. Berni is survived by a daughter, Signe, of Denton, MD, and a son, Eric, of Burlington, VT. Services are by Fellows, Helfenbein and Newnam Funeral Home, P.A., Easton, MD. www.fhnfuneralhome.com
