        OSLER--Julie Ann. Age 56, passed away in Chicago, September 3, 2003, from the devastating effects of a stroke she suffered nearly five years ago. She was a daughter of the late David Osler and Grace Osler Sonenblick and the sister of Susan Osler and Jordan Metzger, Sagaponack, NY. and Amy Osler and Michael Lowenthal of Chicago, IL. She also leaves her loving and beloved nieces, in New York, Dana Brockman and Abby Brockman and in Chicago, Dr. Lydia Sharp and Joanna Sharp and her wonderful caregiver Lily. Julie's loving and giving spirit, her love of classical music, cooking and photography, brought joy to those whose paths she crossed. It breaks our hearts we were unable to make the world a better place for our sweet and unassuming Jewel. We all lose. Her presence, her vitality, her voice has been silenced much too soon. We will miss her always. Memorial contributions in Julie's name can be made to the Animal Welfare Society in New Milford, CT. or the 92nd Street Y School of Music. Memorial to be announced.
        OSLER--Julie. The staff and leadership of the American Committee for the Weizmann Institute of Science deeply mourn the passing of Julie Osler, our dear friend and former Director of Public Affairs for nearly nine years. Julie Osler, who had a distinguished career in communications and public relations, worked enthusiastically to raise the profile of the Weizmann Institute in the U.S. She was dedicated to the Institute's mission of science for the benefit of humanity and demonstrated genuine passion in her professional work. She will be missed greatly by her colleagues at ACWIS and at the Weizmann Institute in Israel. We express our deepest sympathies and condolences to her family. Robert H. Asher, Chairman American Committee Albert Willner, M.D., Pres. Martin S. Kraar, Exec. V.P. Stuart Eizenstat, Chairman Weizmann Institute of Science Prof. Ilan Chet, President
