        WAGNER--Victor H. Victor has joined his beloved Jonesy in death at age 88. His career took him from a one-room Kansas schoolhouse to Greenvale, Little Red, and Brooklyn Friends. Educator to the end, he recently taught bridge to fellow seniors. Daughters Edrie Cote and Irene Wagner, stepchildren Jane and Wazir Peller, grandson Nathan Walter and sister Vada Rolfs loved and will miss him.
