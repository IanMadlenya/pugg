        RUBIN-Ira Lloyd. The Officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Ira Lloyd Rubin, a generous supporter of UJA-Federation. A gifted cardiologist, he was a dedicated leader in our Physician's Division through his activities at Montefiore Medical Center. His bequest to UJA-Federation will benefit our affiliated agencies for generations to come. We extend our sincerest sympathies to his beloved wife, Beatrice; and his brother, Adrien. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair Louise B. Greilsheimer, President Stephen D. Solender, Exec. V.P.
