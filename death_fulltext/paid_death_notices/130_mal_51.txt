        MODDEL-Hazzan Philip. The Cantors Assembly records with sorrow the passing of a respected colleague of over four decades. Quietly and gently, he served the spiritual needs of his congregants here in his adopted land as well as in Germany with great dignity, warmth and care. We extend our sympathy to his children and his loved ones. May his memory abide as a blessing. Hazzan Henry Rosenblum, Pres. Hazzan Abraham B. Shapiro, Executive Administrator
