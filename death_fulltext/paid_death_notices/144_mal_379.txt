        CARELLI-Gabor. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of Gabor Carelli, a stalwart member of our company from 1951 to 1974. During his long career with the Met he sang more than 1,000 performances of 56 roles, making an invaluable contribution to our company. We extend our deepest sympathy to his family.
