        GEDULD-Sylvia. A woman of charm, dignity and love of family and friends. We were blessed to have her in our extended family. Our hearts go out to Victoria, Buzzy, Amanda, Nancy and Bram, who were lucky to have her in their immediate family. We'll all miss her. With Love, Gloria and Paul Asnes
