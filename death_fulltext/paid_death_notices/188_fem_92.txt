        BOGERT - Margaret. The Trustees of the National Foundaton for Facial Reconstruction deeply mourn the death of Margie Bogert. She served with distinction on our board for better than 15 years and will be greatly missed. She attended board meetings with outstanding regularity including the last year of her remarkable life. Her sunny disposition coupled with her most wise counsel and generosity contributed enormously to this organization while benefiting countless children suffering craniofacial anomalies. We extend our heartfelt condolences to her sons Larry and Jerry and grandchildren. Joseph G. McCarthy, M.D. John R. Gordon, President J. Peter Hoguet, Chairman
