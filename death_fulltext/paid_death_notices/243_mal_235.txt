        ARGAMASO--Ravelo. The Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Montefiore Medical Center and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine is deeply saddened with the passing of their senior colleague and devoted faculty member. He was born in the Philippines in 1926 and received his M.D. degree at the University of Santo-Tomas in 1953. After general surgery training in Portland, Oregon he came to Montefiore Hospital as the first resident in Plastic Surgery from 1959-1961. He returned to the full time faculty at Montefiore in 1966 and achieved the rank of full professor in Plastic Surgery in 1982 and in Neurosurgery in 1989 at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. He was an extremely innovative surgeon, artistic and skilled. His main interests were in the area of Cleft Lip and Palate surgery and congenital ear reconstruction. His surgical talents created major improvements in the quality of life for these children. He was recognized by his peers with membership in many scientific organizations among which were the Association of Plastic Surgeons and the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons. Our sympathies go out to his wife Carol, his children Sharlene, Susanne and Stephanie as well as to his three grandchildren, Maggie, Ella and Aidan. The family has planned a memorial service for Friday April 27, 2007 at 11:30 a.m. at the First Baptist Church 407 New Rochelle Rd. Bronxville, New York . Berish Strauch, M.D. Professor and Chairman Dept. of Plastic Surgery, Montefoire Medical Center and The Albert Eistein College of Medicine
