        MUDD--Sidney P. The College of New Rochelle community records with sorrow the death of Sidney P. Mudd, extraordinary friend, longstanding member and Chair of the Board of Trustees. He believed passionately in the mission of the College, and with gentle, steady hand led us to new heights through times of challenge and change. He shared unreservedly with us his considerable gifts but none more than his witness as Christian gentleman. So much stronger for his friendship, we mourn his loss and celebrate his life. Stephen J. Sweeny, Ph.D. President Michael Ambler, Esq. Chair, Board of Trustees
