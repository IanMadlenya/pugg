        $(6$)BAKER--George F. III. It is with profound sadness the Board of Trustees and staff of the Wildlife Conservation Society mourn the death of our dear friend, George F. Baker III. George became a Trustee in 1977 and an Honorary Trustee in 2001. He served on a number of Committees with distinction including the Finance, Nominating and Investment Committees, as well as Chairing several Gala events. In 1898 his great-grandfather was among the early founders in WCS's history. George followed in those footsteps as an enthusiastic and dedicated supporter of WCS's mission to save wildlife and wild lands. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Sarah, children, George IV and Joanna, and the entire Baker family. David T. Schiff, Chairman Board of Trustees Steven E. Sanderson, President and CEO Wildlife Conservation Society
