        HAYS--Constance. The directors and staff of Christie's deeply mourn the loss of Constance Hays, wife of our beloved Deputy Chairman, John Hays. John's tremendous success in the field of American Furniture & Decorative Arts has been supported for years by Connie's love, good humor, generous perspective and intelligence. Many of us at Christie's have had the privilege of knowing her, and we all admired their great love and respect for each other. We will miss Connie tremendously and send our deepest sympathies to John, their children Sophie, John and Henry, and all in their extended families. Stephen S. Lash, Chairman Christopher Burge Honorary Chairman Marc Porter, President Christie's
