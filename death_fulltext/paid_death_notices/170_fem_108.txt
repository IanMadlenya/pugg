        SHAPIRO (Sackowitz)-Barbara. Her valiant heart failed on March 12. Wife, mother of 4, mother-inlaw, beloved ''Nanny'' to 7 grandchildren, proud great grandmother, respected dealer in antiquities for over 4 decades, W.W. II vet, redoubtable bridge player, predeceased by Ben. Died with the dignity and grace that marked her 80 years of life after a short illness. She had the opportunity to bid a loving farewell to her family. She remains in the hearts of her family and her friends for her infectious laugh, her cheery optimistic spirit & her warm, all-embracing heart. A woman of strong principles, she fought bigotry and racial discrimination when it was dangerous to do so. Interment private.
