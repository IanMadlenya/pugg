        LAVITT--Pauline K. The loving wife of Paul P. Lavitt has passed away after a long illness. She is also survived by: son Howard and his wife Jodi, their children Brett, Jacqueline and Austin of Ryebrook, NY; son Arthur and his wife Julie, their children Jake and Brandon of Charlotte, NC; her brother Barry J. Jacobson of NYC and his children Ari, Adam, Brette, Spyro and Stefano. In loving memory of a woman of valor and great dignity who for 35 years of her life fought a severe lung disease. We remember a woman who never complained, a person who always thought of other people first with her sense of caring, always overshadowing any devastating illness that she suffered in life. Pauline had a most special relationship with her father Archie, and her mother Martha, both deceased, and had a special bond with her brother Barry that could never be broken. They shared a love that will be everlasting. May G-d bless her, keep her, her husband and all of her children, grandchildren, nephews, niece and friends who loved her so much. Barry J. Jacobson
