        MELTON--Florence. The Jewish Theological Seminary mourns the passing of Florence Melton, a passionate and outspoken advocate for Jewish education. She, along with her husband Samuel, was a pioneer in developing new approaches to Jewish education, establishing the Melton Research Center for Jewish Education at JTS. Her innovation and enthusiasm will be missed. May her family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Arnold Eisen, Chancellor-elect Gershon Kekst, Board Chairman
