        BLUMENFELD -- Adrian, passed away Monday, April 26, two days short of his 88th birthday. He was a man of brilliant intellect, an avid reader, and a great devotee of classical music and opera. A true Renaissance man, he had a passionate interest in cooking, sailing, jokes and story telling, woodworking, origami, camping, macrame and life itself. We all loved him dearly, admired him inordinately and will miss him grievously; his wife Beatrice, two daughters Joan Blumenfeld and Susan Lisagor and four grandchildren, Jessica and Sara Lisagor, and Robert and Max Krone.
