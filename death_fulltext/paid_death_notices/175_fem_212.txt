        VOGEL-Helen. February 14, 1912 to August 23, 2001. Holocaust survivor, she is mourned by her friends of many years the Karchmar and Boehm families, by Stanislawa Perkowska her devoted caretaker, and by her sister Lucia Orenstein of Paris. Helen was a true friend to everyone, and we will miss her lively intelligence, her wit, and her kind heart. Any donations in her honor should be given to American Red Magen David of Israel, Doctors without Borders USA, or Amnesty International.
