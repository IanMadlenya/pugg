        MELAMID-Alexander. My dear husband Alex's life came to an end on March 19, 2001 while in Cuernavaca, Mexico. Wife Ilse, daughters Diane and Suzy, grandchildren Rebecca, Kevin and Scott and friend Eduardo all mourn him. His scholarly achievements and kindness in life will be treasured. A memorial in New York will be announced.
