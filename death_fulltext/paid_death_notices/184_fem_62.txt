        CELLA-Suzanne Godart. Passed away peacefully on May 7, 2002 at her home in Cutchogue, NY at the age of 79. A designer, artist, linguist and singer. More importantly, Suzanne was one who loved and was loved, and one who only gave and always shared with others. A truly unique person. She will always be with us. She leaves her husband, Joseph; sister, Daisy; nephew, Randy; niece, Judy; three grandnieces; and one great-grandniece. There will be no services locally. A mass and interment will take place in Chisholm, Minnesota. Donation to East End Hospice would be appreciated.
        CELLA-Suzanne Godart. May 7, 2002. Beloved friend of Elaine and Jerry. She will be dearly missed.
