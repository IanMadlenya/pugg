        GARDNER--Andrew T. October 30. What a wonderful son. What an extraordinary brother. What an amazing, rich and full half-life he lead. We shall always honor his memory with the same passion, humor and love that he showered on Kim, Jake, Kyle, Juliet, Jeff, Robbie, Annabel and Charlotte. Allan Gardner and Elisabeth Gardner Ostrow
