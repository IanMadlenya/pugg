        SCHIFF-Bernard. We are saddened beyond words by the loss of our beloved friend. We will miss his droll humor, our laughter together, his concern for the welfare of those close to him, and the joy of just being in his company. Our sympathies go out to Jackie, his children and grand children. We will always be there for Jackie. Estelle and Saul
