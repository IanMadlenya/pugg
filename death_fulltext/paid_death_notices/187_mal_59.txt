        MILLER-Michael. The partners and staff of Bloom Hochberg & Co, mourn the passing of our esteemed and beloved partner, Michael Miller. Michael was a man of stature, loyalty and integrity who exuded genuine warmth to all he met. We will miss his enduring smile. He represented a unique love for his wife and children, and a continued desire to serve his partners and clientele. Sadly, we offer our sincere condolences to Margie, Russell and Lisa. May they find solace in the memory of Michael's goodness during his life.
