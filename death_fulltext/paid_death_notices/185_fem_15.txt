        ARONOWITZ - George. Sixteen years have passed and you are still, and will always be, a legend, so loved and missed even by those who never knew you. Our loving Mom did this all these years and now she is with you. How lucky we were to have had you both. All of our love. Merrill, Andy, Todd, Adam, Steve, Julie and Jordan
