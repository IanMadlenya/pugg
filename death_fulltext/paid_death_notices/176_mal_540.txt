        EIGER-Nathan. We mourn the loss of our uncle, whose death marks the end of an era. He was the last of the Eiger brothers, who were so vital and important in our lives. Nathan, together with his brothers, brought us and our mother to this country only months before the war. He was our mentor and a father figure, having lost our father when we were children. His love and devotion to our mother had no bounds. When he became successful after many years of hard work he never said no to anyone who needed help. We will remember him for his caring and generosity. Aaron Ziegelman, Lillian Chanales
