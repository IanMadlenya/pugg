        LISZ-Gary, Peter Martins, Ballet Master in Chief, Howard Solomon, Chairman of the Board, Robert I. Lipp, President of the Board of Directors and the entire New York City Ballet deeply mourn the passing of our friend and colleague Gary Lisz. From the stylized, epochal beauty of his costume dsigns for ''Waltz Trilogy'' to the sleek, contemporary athleticism of his creations for ''Concerto in Five Movements,'' Gary's keen esthetic, unerring eye for detail and comfort, and attendant love and appreciation of ballet, helped to elevate our craft. The creative realm in which he worked has lost, all too prematurely, a gifted and talented artist. We express our heartfelt sympathies to his family.
        LISZ-Gary. Dear Gary, we will miss working with you on your beautiful ballets and most of all, we'll miss your smiling face. God bless. Barbara & Arthur Matera
