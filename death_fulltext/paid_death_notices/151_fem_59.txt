        GILMAN-Sylvia P. The entire Beth Israel Medical Center family acknowledges with sadness the passing of Sylvia P. Gilman who, throughout much of her life, contributed greatly to furthering the extraordinary legacy of support to Beth Israel started by her grandfather, Moses Phillips, a founder of our institution and continued by the generations who have followed. Her generosity, and that of her late husband Charles, were recognized with the naming of Beth Israel's Sylvia and Charles Gilman Hall. To the Phillips and Gilman families and all who loved her, we extend our heartfelt condolences. Morton P. Hyman Chairman, Board of Trustees Matthew E. Fink, M.D. President and CEO Henry Singman, M.D. President, Medical Board
