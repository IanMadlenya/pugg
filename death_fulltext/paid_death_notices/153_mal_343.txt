        RODIN-Bernard M. The Chwatt family mourns the untimely passing of our longtime friend and business associate. We will all miss his clever anecdotes, warm smile, brilliant business mind, and tremendous sense of humor and wit. Our deepest sympathy to his wife, Fran, and his entire family. He will be sorely missed by us all.
