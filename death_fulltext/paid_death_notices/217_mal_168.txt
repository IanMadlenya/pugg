        LEVINSON--Samuel, 92, cranky and cheap, but we loved him anyway. Devoted husband of Tyn. Athlete; fun to be with; loved his family, astronomy, classical music, and WNYC. Never bought a golfball in his life. Multi-tasker; could sew, clean, and yell at you all at the same time. Collector of rubber bands. Will be missed by entire family. He would think this obituary the biggest waste of money.
