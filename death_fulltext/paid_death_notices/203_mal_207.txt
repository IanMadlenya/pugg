        LUBELL--Arthur, Esq. The entire Yeshiva University family is deeply saddened by the passing of a cherished and devoted friend of our university and its affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS), who in his discretion, and in consultation with his clients established several major gifts at our university's undergraduate schools, at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and at the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary. He was beloved by all who knew him. Heartfelt condolences to his children: Ruth Tallury, Diane (and David) Hochner, Lewis (and Terry) Lubell, Esq., and his seven grandchildren. May the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Richard M. Joel, President Norman Lamm, Chancellor Ronald P. Stanton, Chairman YU Board of Trustees Julius Berman, Chairman RIETS Board of Trustees
