        ZYSMAN--David H. The entire Yeshiva University community and its affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary express profound sorrow over the passing of a devoted leader of Yeshiva University who also dedicated a lifetime of professional service to the building of the State of Israel. Known far and wide as a passionate and imaginative fundraiser, he served as Vice President for Development of the University for almost 12 years and was the grand architect of substantial and unparalleled growth in its fundraising. A Benefactor and honorary alumnus of YU, he established David H. Zysman Scholarship Funds on behalf of RIETS and all of the affiliated schools of the University and played a major role in the founding of YU's Sy Syms School of Business. The historic Main Building on the University's Wilf Campus was named David H. Zysman Hall in his honor in recognition of his extraordinary commitment to Yeshiva University and the world Jewish community. For 35 years he served as national director and New York director of Israel Bonds, which he helped found, and helped generate more than $10 billion in sales on behalf of Israel. Condolences are extended to his sister Rosita (and Philip) Shamis, and to his nieces, nephews, grandnieces and grandnephews, and to his longtime friend, Zipora Koppel. May his entire family and many friends be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Services Tuesday, June 29th, 11:30 AM at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, NYC. Richard M. Joel, President Norman Lamm, Chancellor Ronald P. Stanton, Chairman, YU Board of Trustees Julius Berman, Chairman, RIETS Board of Trustees
