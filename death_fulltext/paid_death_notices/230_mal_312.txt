        SCOTT--Eugene L. The Tennis Week magazine staff mourn the passing of a unique man. Mr. Scott and his family are ever in our thoughts. His life and legacy will be celebrated April 1 at 11AM at The Church of the Heavenly Rest, 2 E. 90th St. In lieu of flowers, the family requests contributions to the Lucy Foundation, 15 Elm Pl., Rye, NY 10580, through which the family supports education and tennis programs.
