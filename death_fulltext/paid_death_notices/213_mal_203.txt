        MAJOR--Andrew. Died Friday, October 15, New York City. Beloved husband of Flora and father of Katherine Major Firman and Nicholas Major. Loving grandfather of Linsay Firman. A legend in the textile industry, fondly known as ''The King of the Mills.'' Born in Hungary in 1921, educated in Switzerland and England, served in the US Army as a decorated veteran of the Pacific Theater. After the war he joined Mastercraft Weaving Corporation in New Jersey as a trainee and in 1960 became the president of the company which had moved to North Carolina. In 1969 he acquired the business, now called Mastercraft Corp., and in 1976 sold it to Collins & Aikman, where he became president of C & A's Decorative Fabric group and its seven plants and 6000 employees in 1981. In 1984 he was elected to the C & A Board. In 1994, at his retirement, the original Mastercraft plant, which he had built, was renamed in his honor. But his retirement was short-lived, as he became both a consultant to Cone Mills and the founder of their Cone Jacquards operation. In 1999 he was elected to the Board of Directors of Joan Fabrics Corp. The recipient of numerous industry and civic awards, including the first Lifetime Leadership Award from Dupont in 1995, which embodied his creativity, devotion and legendary status in the industry. In 2002 he received ''The Trailblazer Award'' and was inducted into the American Furniture Hall of Fame. He will always be remembered for his wit, generosity and love of life. A private family funeral will be held at Arlington National Cemetery. A memorial service is planned for a later date.
