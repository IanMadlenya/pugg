        ROSENBERG--Sylvia S. The Faculty, Advisory Council and Alumni Association of the Columbia University School of Social Work note with great sadness the passing of Sylvia Rosenberg, class of 1958. A psychiatric social worker, member of the School's faculty, field work instructor and private practitioner, she served also as a chief social worker at Presbyterian Hospital and taught at the College of Physicians and Surgeons. A devoted alumna, she was an Alumni Board and Advisory Council member who initiated and chaired many important programs for the alumni and the School, and her commitment and generous support will help ensure Columbia's future. She was an esteemed colleague and beloved friend who will be greatly missed by all who knew her. Jeanette C. Takamura, Dean
