        MATTONE-Vincent J. Dear Michele, Alan and Vinny Jr. We deeply regret the loss of your father and our friend and mentor. We are heartbroken at his sudden passing. The greatness of your father was only matched by the size of his heart. He touched our lives forever and we will sorely miss him. MaryAnn Graham, Mala Stern and Tim Greene
