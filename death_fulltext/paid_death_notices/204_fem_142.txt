        LIPSCOMB--Roberte. Sarah Lawrence College mourns the death of Roberte Lipscomb, Emerita, member of the Sarah Lawrence French faculty. She loved teaching, and she was loved in return by generations of students. A mainstay of the French faculty from 1962 to 1985, she was a superb teacher and a person of uncommon dignity and grace. We send our deepest sympathy to her husband, James Lipscomb, and all her family. Michele Tolela Myers, President Barbara Kaplan, Dean of the College
