        COAKLEY-Charles. It is with deep sorrow that the Mayor and Board of Trustees record the death of Charles Coakley of 208 Beach Walk, Saltaire, on Friday, May 22nd, 1998. A resident of the Village for over 25 years, Charles was a man of learning, wit and caring to all who knew him. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Trudi, his family, Greg and Kim and Lyssa and Glenn, and his grandchildren. Charles will be greatly missed.
