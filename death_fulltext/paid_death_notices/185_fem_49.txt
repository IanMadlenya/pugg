        McCAW-Susan L. The staff and Board of Directors of The Alan Guttmacher Institute are deeply saddened by the passing of our friend and colleague, Susan L. McCaw, our former Director of Finance and Administration. Although Susan worked at the Institute for only a short time before her illness struck, her professional skills, warmth and humor made an immediate and lasting impression. She was everything we could hope for in a coworker--smart, funny and caring. We will miss her and extend our heartfelt condolences to her husband Bob and children Anne and Ben.
