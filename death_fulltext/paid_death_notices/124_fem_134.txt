        SCHONBERG-Bessie. The artists, Board of Directors and staff of Dance Theater Workshop (DTW) deeply mourn the loss of their friend, artistic guide and mentor. Her vision, inspiration and generosity will be with us forever. She now joins her eternal love, Dimitry Varley. Our heartfelt condolences to her sister, Helga Hadsall; and nieces and nephew Bessie Peterson & Pat and Jim Martine. A gathering of friends and colleagues is being planned for late June. Please contact DTW for information at 212-691-6500.
