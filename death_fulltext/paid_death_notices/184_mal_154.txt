        GUTH-Paul C. The partners, associates and staff of Kelley Drye & Warren LLP mourn with deep sadness the passing of our partner and dear friend. Paul's professional and personal contributions to the Firm are invaluable, and will continue to be felt for years to come. Both the Firm, and its clients, are indeed fortunate to have benefited from his counsel. We will sorely miss him and extend our deepest sympathy to Joan and the other members of Paul's family.
