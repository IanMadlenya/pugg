        CASLOW--Rubin. The officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Rubin Caslow, beloved father of Eric and Madeline and Robert and Miriam. The Caslow family's historic commitment to Jewish life and learning was built on a foundation of unparalleled generosity through active participation on our Board of Directors and support of numerous agencies within our socialservice network. Such dedication continues through the service of the family and overflows with the spirit of klal Yisrael, enriching our work in New York, in Israel, and worldwide. We extend our deepest sympathies to Rubin's beloved wife, Charlotte; to his children, Eric and Madeline, and Robert and Miriam; to his grandchildren, Emily and Nathan Gindi, Heather and Jeff Pavell, David and Lisa Caslow, and Adam Caslow; and to the entire family. Morris W. Offit, President Susan K. Stern, Chair of the Board John S. Ruskay, Exec. V.P. & C.E.O.
