        STEWART-Rudolph. We mourn with great sadness the passing of Rudolph Stewart, Associate House Manager of Carnegie Hall, who for more than 28 years greeted artists, patrons, and everyone to the Hall with unforgettable warmth and grace. Rudy's wonderful smile, and his friendship, will remain linked with our Carnegie Hall memories, and in our hearts forever. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his daughter, Kim, and to his entire family. Isaac Stern, President Sanford I. Weill, Chairman Claus Jacobs, Treasurer The Board of Trustees and Staff of Carnegie Hall
