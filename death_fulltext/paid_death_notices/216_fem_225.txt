        EPSTEIN--Fannie (Fine, Altman), March 27, 1915-January 16, 2005, of Manhattan, formerly of East Meadow and Brooklyn. Predeceased by husbands, Joshua Epstein and Jack Fine; sister, Anne Altman; stepson, David Epstein. Survived and greatly loved by daughters, Susan Hochberg and Maxine Bochnia, and steps, Anne Epstein and Carolyn and Paul Koistinen. Also by grandchildren, Michael and Rachel Bochnia, Sarah Luijpers (Patrick), Eve Burian (Ron), Beth Hounza (Max), David Koistinen (Tomoko), Janice Harris (Andrew) and seven greatgrandchildren. Fannie was a most loving daughter, sister, friend, wife, mother, grandmother and great-grandmother. Although she had little recognition or memory at the end of her long and productive life, her face would still light up with pleasure at the sight of her newborn great - granddaughter. Those of us who saw her smile and call Arielle ''My baby'' as she reached for her hand, were very moved. Fannie was a woman of opinion, dedication and awareness. Politically active till well into her 80's, her unflagging interest and involvement in the events of the world and the city in which she lived, never wavered. She loved the staff and her work at the Nassau Center in Woodbury, Long Island, and her winters in Guadalajara, Mexico. Her last 24 years were spent in New York City, where she was an active supporter of the Arts. She will be missed by everyone whose life she touched and she will be remembered by all with love and humor. Cremation private. We will arrange a memorial meeting for her in New York City this spring. Contact C/O Epstein, Apt 1505, 525 Audubon Ave, New York, New York 10040.
