        KINGSLEY-Charles. It is with deepest sympathy that we mourn the passing of our friend, Charles. We will miss his warmth, kindness, and generosity of spirit. He made each of us feel truly welcome and important and we have vivid, loving memories of happy days spent with him, Emily, and Jason at their home in Chappaqua. Charles will be dearly missed, but lovingly remembered. The Sesame Street Writers
