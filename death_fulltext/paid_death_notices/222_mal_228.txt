        TILLES--Norman. It is with profound sorrow that we mourn the passing of Norman Tilles, who had a long and distinguished history of service to the American Jewish community, and especially to HIAS the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, for which he served as Board President from 1995 to 1998. Norman's selfless and hard work on behalf of refugees, asylumseekers and other immigrants in need marked him as a true humanitarian of global scope. Our sincere condolences go to his wife, Florence, their children, grandchildren and great - grandchildren. May his memory be for a blessing.
