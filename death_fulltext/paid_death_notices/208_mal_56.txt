        JENKINS--Andrew. We are devastated by the tragic passing of a dear and very special friend, a gentle young man who we grew to love as a member of our own family. Our hearts go out to his mother Barbara, his brother Christopher, his bride of ten days, his step father Arnie and his sister-in-law Sue. All of you are in our thoughts and Andy will live in our memory forever. Havva, Reed, Shamil & Cynthia Idriss
