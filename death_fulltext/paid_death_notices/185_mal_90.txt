        WASSERMAN-Lew R. The Tisch School of the Arts notes with deep sorrow the passing of our friend and generous benefactor Lew Wasserman. A visionary and pioneering leader in the film industry, he was an enthusiastic supporter of the School as well as a friend and mentor to Dean Mary Schmidt Campbell. He transformed the lives of hundreds of our students through his support. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife Edie and the entire Wasserman family.
