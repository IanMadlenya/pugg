        DAREN--Hazel Ruth. On February 18, after a long courageous battle with cancer and MS. Her beauty and remarkable intellect were with her until the end. She was surrounded by love and unstinting care due largely to the loving dedication and resolve of Jeff Aron, her family and friends. She leaves behind grieving parents Tillie and Reuben, brother Stuart and a large circle of devoted family, friends and colleagues. She will remain forever in our hearts. Service Sunday, February 22, at 11:45 AM at ''The Riverside'' Amsterdam Ave. at 76th St.
