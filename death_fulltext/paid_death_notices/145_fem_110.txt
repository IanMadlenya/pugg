        FALK-Georgina (nee Strunz), at age 88, a vibrant and beautiful lady has suddenly left her husband, daughter, neighbors and friends. To remember her, we will be joining together on Saturday, February 20, 2PM, at All Souls Unitarian Church, Lexington Ave. at 80 Street. Please, no flowers. Instead, honor her lovely spirit by your donations to Central Park Conservancy (14 East 60 St., NYC 10022), or the Art Students League (215 West 57 Street, NYC 10019).
