        GLUCKSMAN--Lewis L. Lehman Brothers and its employees mourn the loss of Lewis L. Glucksman. In his 21 years with the Firm, Mr. Glucksman served as our chief operating officer, president, co-chairman and co-chief executive officer, chairman & chief executive officer and acted as a dedicated mentor to many of our current management. He will be remembered on Wall Street as a giant in our industry and will be remembered at Lehman Brothers for his strong leadership, his invaluable guidance and his outstanding dedication to the Firm and, above all, as a friend.
