        LERNER-Abe. Of Manhattan, peacefully at home on November 14, 2002, at age 94. He is survived by his loving and devoted wife, Kit Currie, and by children Hannah, Michael and Judith. Noted book designer and avid collector of modern fine printing, former Director of Design and Production for both World Publishing Co. and Macmillan, President Emeritus of Typophiles and longtime member of the Grolier Club, Abe will be sorely missed by friends and colleagues worldwide.
