        CUSACK-John. Our deepest sympathy is extended to the family of John Cusack, a former Administrator of Personnel and Employee Relations. His concern for the morale of the System's employees was heartfelt and his knowledge of labor law outstanding. He was a deeply religious man who practiced the basic tenets of Christianity. He will be sorely missed. John S.T. Gallagher, CEO Roy J. Zuckerberg, Chairman, Board of Trustees North Shore-LIJ Health System
