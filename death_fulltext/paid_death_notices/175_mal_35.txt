        STARKEY-Peter. It is with deep sorrow that we mourn the incomprehensible loss of our close friend and Saltaire softball league mate, Peter Starkey. We send our deepest sympathies to Renee, Katherine, Patrick, Maura, David, Carolyn, Elizabeth, and Dick. We have laughed with Pete and played both with him and against him since we were children. ''Sweet Pete's'' contagious joy, sense of humor, and competitiveness made every game we played a celebration of friendship. You will remain in our hearts always. The Dragons
