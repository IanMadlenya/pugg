        METZGER-Carolyn. The Jewish Theological Seminary family records with sorrow the death of Carolyn Metzger, whose love for JTS was legendary. She, along with her husband Lawrence z''l, was a staunch supporter of JTS for more than a quarter of a century through her devoted service to the Torah Fund Campaign. Her contributions to JTS and the community will live on through the Metzger Prize for Community Outreach established in 1999. Our hearts go out to her children Marylyn, David and Charles, and her entire family on the loss of this exemplary woman. May her memory be for a blessing. Ismar Schorsch, Chancellor Gershon Kekst, Chairman
