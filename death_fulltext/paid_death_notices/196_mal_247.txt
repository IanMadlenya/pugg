        LEMONIK -- Murray. We loved him like a brother. Murray had a rare generosity, delightful sense of humor, and gentle sweetness. He was tireless on the tennis court and graciously helpful at all other times. We say goodbye with admiration, gratitude, and pain. The Boys from the Hewlett High School Tennis Courts: Bernie Malverne, Joel the Commissioner, Big Dick, Joe the Bookie, Jack, Gerry Shortel, David Napal. >>AD#
