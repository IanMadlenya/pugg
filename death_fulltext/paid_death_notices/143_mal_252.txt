        HIGGINBOTHAM-Judge A. Leon, Jr. Earl G. Graves and ''Black Enterprise'' Magazine deeply mourn the passing of Judge A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr., one of the great jurists of our time. He was a truly outstanding leader and role model for our entire nation. For African Americans, his loss is felt even more deeply. A tireless soldier for justice, civil rights, and equal opportunity, he will be sorely missed and impossible to replace.
        HIGGINBOTHAM-A. Leon, Jr. His fellow founders, Board, staff and members of the Voluntary Committee of Lawyers (VCL) extend our deepest sympathy to the family of this beloved man and mourn his loss along with all who loved justice. Charles D. Adler, President
