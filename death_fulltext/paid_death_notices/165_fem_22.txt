        BAILIS-Susan. The Yeshiva University family is saddened by the passing of a highly respected leader of the Jewish community, the beloved sister of Stephen D.

May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jeruslem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University Robert M. Beren, Chairman Board of Trustees
