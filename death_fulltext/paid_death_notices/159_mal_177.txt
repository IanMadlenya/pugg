        CINER-Irwin. Of Harrison, NY, on April 15, 2000, at the age of 97. Beloved husband of the late Marian Goldschmidt, caring father of Pat Hill and Liz Jackson, and father-inlaw of David Hill and Brooke Jackson, loving grandfather of Jean and Douglas Hill, and Jeffrey, Brett and Jennie Jackson. Irwin, and his late brother Charles, were a driving force in America's move from precious to fashion jewelry in the late 1930's. The 108 year old Ciner Fashion Jewelry Company is the last of the old time jewelry manufacturers to continue as a family business.
