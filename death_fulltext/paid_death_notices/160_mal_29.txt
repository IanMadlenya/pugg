        de ROTHSCHILD-Raphael. The Officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York deeply mourn the tragic and untimely passing of Raphael de Rothschild, son of Nili and Nathaniel de Rothschild. Raphael's grandfather, Elie de Rothschild, was for many years chairman of the United Jewish Appeal in France. Raphael's father was a major supportor of UJA-Federation as well, reflecting his family's long and distinguished contributions to world Jewish life. We extend our deepest sympathies to Nili, Nathaniel, and their entire family. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair James S. Tisch, President John S. Ruskay, Exec VP
        de ROTHSCHILD-Raphael. On April 22nd, 2000 at age 23 in New York. Adored son of Nili and Nathaniel de Rothschild, and adored brother of Esther de Rothschild. The most kind, thoughtful, intelligent, charming, compassionate human being that ever was, he blessed his parents, his sister and his family with the greatest love throughout his ever so short life, and touched all those fortunate enough to know him. Go in peace our Angel, you will always be in our hearts.
