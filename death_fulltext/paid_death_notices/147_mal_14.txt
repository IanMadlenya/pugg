        MOUNT-Lester A., M.D. Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons and New York Presbyterian Hospital mourn the passing of Lester A. Mount, professor emeritus and consultant emeritus of clinical neurosurgery. A worldwide lecturer, he made many outstanding contributions to medical education, research, and practice in the field of neurosurgery. An author, he published in many books and journals. An esteemed colleague and teacher, he served Columbia Presbyterian for more than 50 years as a professor of clinical neurosurgery and acting chairman of the Department of Neurosurgery at the Neurological Institute. In 1989, he received the highest award given by the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, the Harvey Cushing Medal. His commitment to improving the lives of patients was unsurpassed, and his work in the management of subarachnoid hemorhage and intracranial aneurysms was invaluable to the world's understanding of neurosurgery. A long-time friend and colleague whose many contributions enriched the Neurological Institute, he will be greatly missed and his memory cherished. We extend our deepest sympathy to Dr. Mount's family.
