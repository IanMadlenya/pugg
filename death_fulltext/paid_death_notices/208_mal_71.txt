        POOL--J. Lawrence. We note with sadness the passing of Dr. J. Lawrence Pool, Professor Emeritus of Neurological Surgery at Columbia University's College of Physicians & Surgeons and former Chairman of the Department of Neurological Surgery at the Neurological Institute of New York of Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. Dr. Pool was one of the greatest neurosurgeons of the 20th century. A masterful and innovative surgeon, he paved the way for many advances in the care of neurosurgical patients. He possessed a brilliant intellect, a keen wit, and an abundance of charm. He was multi-talented: erudite, intellectual, a superb athlete, an excellent water colorist and a thoughtful and interesting author, having written many books on subjects as varied as fly fishing to Revolutionary War history. He was a superb teacher and mentor to countless students and young doctors. His unique combination of talents, wide range of interests, and multiple accomplishments in many fields made him truly one of the most remarkable and inspiring individuals one could ever hope to meet. Our condolences to his family. The Department of Neurological Surgery New York Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia Univ College of Physicians & Surgeons
