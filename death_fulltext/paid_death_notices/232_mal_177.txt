        JOHNSON--J. Stewart. With great sadness, the staff of the Metropolitan Museum of Art notes the passing of Stewart Johnson, a long time colleague and friend, who for 14 years was Consultant for Design and Architecture in the Department of Modern Art until his retirement in 2004. A connoisseur and scholar, he curated many exhibitions, including retrospectives of the designers Charles Rennie Mackintosh and Emile Jacques Ruhlmann, and under his guidance the Met's collection of design and architecture was significantly enhanced. The 2005-6 exhibition ''A Curator's Eye'' paid tribute to the many acquisitions Stewart brought into the Museum, which will reside here to educate and enlighten for generations to come.
