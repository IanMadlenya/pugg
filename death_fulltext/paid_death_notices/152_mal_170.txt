        SHAPIRO-Al. New Line Cinema mourns the passing of Al Shapiro, our beloved friend and colleague. We will miss his wit, wisdom, leadership, and laughter. While we have thirteen years of memories to cherish, we will forever remember a man with an infectious love of life who was equally dedicated to Honnie, his loving wife, and his family at New Line. Those who were touched by Al know the overwhelming sense of loss that is shared by his family and friends.
