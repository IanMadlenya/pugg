        BAMBERGER -- Marjorie Grace Rothenberg (nee Zunser), 87, died May 4, 2006. She was born February 11, 1919 in Brooklyn, NY. Beloved wife of the late Edmund M. Bamberger, devoted mother of John Z. Rothenberg and Dr. Peter M. Rothenberg. Loving mother-in-law of Dr. Deborah Brownstone Rothenberg, adoring grandmother of Jessica, Joshua, Erica, and Jonathan. A previous marriage to Nathaniel S. Rothenberg ended in divorce. A prolific designer and art director, Marjorie studied fine art at The Pratt Institute and Art Student's League. She had a versatile career in advertising and magazine illustration, children's books and toys, and was a pioneer in overseas product design and development. She made her first Far East work trip in 1967 and, for over twenty years, would spend months at a time in villages and small factories, designing limited editions of her popular figurines and holiday ornaments for the collector's market. She continued designing well into her 80's. She loved her work, her many friends here and in the Far East and was devoted to her two sons, her daughter-in-law, and her grandchildren. A fulfilled and adventurous life. Amen!
