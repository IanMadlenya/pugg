        LESSER--Virginia Hirst died in her sleep on November 18th at the Westhampton Care Center in Westhampton, New York. She was 94. Born in Eau Claire, Wisconsin on March 8, 1912, the daughter of an Episcopal clergyman, and raised in Lewistown, Montana where she played the organ in her father's Church, she was a self-taught Classical pianist. An artist and educator, trained at The Art Institute of Chicago and the Graduate Teachers College of Winnetka, she taught elementary art and grade school in the Manhasset and Scarsdale public schools. The spouse of the cultural anthropologist Alexander Lesser of Hofstra University, she lived for many years in Manhasset and Levittown. Her bright wit, her cleverness and her affectionate and engaging personality are greatly missed by her family. She is survived by her son Stephen and his three children of East Hampton, New York, her daughter Katherine of Portland, Maine and her sister Elizabeth of Tucson, Arizona. Mrs. Lesser chose to be cremated. No service is planned at this time, but her family plans to memorialize her life and her work at a future time.
