        LARSSON-Lillebi. A native of Sweden, was a highly recognized flight attendant with both Pan Am and Delta Airlines. She died much too early of cancer on January 10, 2002. She was a fun-loving person and her laughter will be greatly missed. A memorial service will be held on Saturday, January 19, at the Church of Sweden, 5 E. 48 St., 4PM. We miss you, Lillebi.
