        GANG-Martin. The Officers, members and staff of the American Jewish Committee mourn the death of Martin Gang, a distinguished partner in the Los Angeles law firm of Gang, Tyre, Ramer and Brown, and an AJC Honorary National Vice President, as well as a member of our Board of Governors and National Leadership Council. Long committed to the Jewish people and social justice, Martin was a founder, chairman and president of AJC's Los Angeles Chapter. He was the recipient of 2 of AJC's highest honors, the Judge Learned Hand Award and the Distinguished Service Award. His exceptional generosity and wise counsel will be sorely missed. We send our heartfelt condolences to his grieving family. Robert S. Rifkind, President David A. Harris, Executive Director Bruce Ramer, Chair Board of Governors Rabbi Gary Greenebaum, Director Los Angeles Chapter
