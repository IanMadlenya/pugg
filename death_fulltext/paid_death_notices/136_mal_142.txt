        MESAR-Joe. We are greatly saddened by the untimely passing of Joe Mesar, Financial Secretary of the National Organization of Legal Services Workers. Joe was not only a client to us, but was a good friend over these past twenty years. We are going to miss him terribly. However, in the immortal words of Joe Hill, ''We will not mourn, we will organize.'' Eisner & Hubbard, P.C.
