        LANE--Bland. The Board of Trustees of the Flight Attendant Medical Research Institute FAMRI is very sad to announce the sudden and unexpected passing of our beloved Board member, Bland Lane, in San Francisco, on February 15, 2007. Bland was an extraordinary and accomplished woman, who struggled to lead an active and productive life, while suffering from COPD that developed from working as a nonsmoking flight attendant for 48 years in smoke-filled airline cabins. In recent years, Bland, along with fellow nonsmoking flight attendants, Patty Young, Lani Blissard and Leisa Sudderth, was a dedicated member of FAMRI's Board of Trustees, a courtapproved, not-for-profit foundation that supports scientific research to combat the many diseases caused from exposure to tobacco smoke. Bland as an integral part of the Board voted to fund research in some of the most outstanding medical schools in the world -Hopefully Blands efforts will help find a cure. Bland was truly a renaissance woman with tremendous insight, who traveled the world, spoke multiple languages and charmed everyone she met. In addition to being a devoted sister to Audre and loving aunt to Karen and her family, Bland was a true friend, loyal and compassionate. Bland, we love you and will miss you forever. You were truly oneof-a-kind. A Memorial Tribute, honoring Bland Lane will be announced. If you had the privilege of spending time with Bland, we would love to share those memories with you.
