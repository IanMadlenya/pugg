        JOHANNESEN--Grant. The House of Steinway & Sons notes with profound sadness the passing of the distinguished American pianist Grant Johannesen on March 27, near Munich, Germany at the age of 83. A deeply valued member of our Steinway Artist family for 54 years, Mr. Johannesen won acclaim throughout the world for his performances of Poulenc, Faure, Milhaud, and SaintSaens. He was an elegant exponent of Bach, Beethoven and Chopin as well as American composers including Barber, Bowles, Copland, MacDowell, and Sessions. A native of Salt Lake City, Mr. Johannesen studied with Robert Casadesus, Egon Petri and Nadia Boulanger. He was a frequent soloist on television's ''Bell Telephone Hour'', and he appeared in every music capital of the world and with the most illustrious conductors of his time. Mr. Johannesen's discography is highlighted by the fact that he was the first pianist to record the complete works of Faure. He led the Cleveland Institute of Music with great distinction from 1974 to 1985, and he was named to the rank of Chevalier des Arts et Lettres by the French government for his vast contribution to French music. He was a cherished friend to us, and his dedication to our piano was a perpetual source of inspiration. We will miss him deeply and wish to convey our heartfelt condolences to his son David and his family. Bruce A. Stevens, President Peter B.
