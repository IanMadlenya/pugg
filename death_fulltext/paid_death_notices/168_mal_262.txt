        VICENTE-Esteban. The members and directors of The Corporation of Yaddo note with sadness the passing of Esteban Vicente, a long-time friend of the artists who have worked at Yaddo who with his wife, Harriet, celebrated the 100th anniversary of the founding of Yaddo by establishing an endowed residency at Yaddo for painters with a preference for artists from Spain. Our thoughts and prayers are with Harriet and the Vicente family.
