        STEIGMAN--Stephen ''Steve''. Beloved husband of Peggy Flaum and beloved father of Willy Sarah Steigman of Riverdale and Quogue, N.Y. Mr. Steigman epitomized the self made man. From the 1960s through the 1990s he was one of America's leading commercial photographers and directors. His most recognized and enduring image, entitled ''Blown Away'' has served as Maxell's logo since the 1980s. He will live forever in the hearts of his family, his extended family and friends who cherished his wry wit, enormous artistry and talent, and the irrepressible twinkle in his eye. A memorial service will be held October 20, 2:30PM at Riverdale Yonkers Society for Ethical Culture, 4450 Fieldston Road, Bronx, New York 10471.
