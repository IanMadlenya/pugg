        VERCESI - Anthony. We mourn the passing of our dear friend, Anthony Vercesi, on May 30, 2006. Tony was a man who celebrated life, a wise and gentle soul who cared deeply for his family and friends. We miss him, and we extend our deepest sympathy to his beloved wife Brenda, his attentive sons, Jon and Paul, and their families. Matthew and Maggi Goldstein
