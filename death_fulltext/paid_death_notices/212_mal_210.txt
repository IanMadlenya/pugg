        GLASSMAN--Rabbi Bernard. The Rabbinical Assembly mourns with profound sorrow the passing of our beloved colleague, rabbi emeritus of Tifereth Israel Congregation New Bedford, MA. He served as book review editor of our journal and edited our annual booklet in memory of colleagues. We extend our deepest condolences to his family and to all who were touched through his rabbinate.
