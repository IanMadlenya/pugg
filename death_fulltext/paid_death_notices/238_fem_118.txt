        HEITSCHEL--Joan Marie born August 24, 1929 to Gean Harold Heitschel and Sophie Horowitz Heitschel, died Sunday, November 5th, 2006 at 6:00 pm under the light of a full moon. Pictures of her as a young woman reflect something of her glamorous show business mother, perky and alive with a certain sense of stage presence. As an older woman she was possessed of an acute perception of the undertones in people and was not afraid to respond to them head-on. In many ways she could be quite formidable and was respected as such; but at Washington Square Institute where she was Registrar for over twenty years, she was also loved and revered by students and staff alike for her insight, care and commitment to the intricacies of life at one of New York City's premiere psychoanalytic training institutes and clinics. Her many and valuable contributions there will not soon be forgotten, nor will soon be forgotten her independent and great-souled esprit. She is survived by all of her adopted Washington Square Institute family, whom she loved, with special mention of Sarah Sender, Barbara Karlen, Maxine Exum, Marguerite Klein, Dr. Gerd Fenchel and Sandra Ospina who helped make her final days more comfortable. From all of us, Joan, farewell and God Bless. A memorial service will be announced in the near future.
