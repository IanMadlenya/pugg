        GOLDMUNTZ-Lawrence. The officers, members and staff of the American Jewish Committee are deeply saddened by the death of Lawrence Goldmuntz, noted scientist and public policy consultant, who served AJC in numerous distinguished capacities for many years, including as president of our Washington, DC Chapter and a member of our Board of Governors. His support for causes related to US and Israeli security, as well as his abiding devotion to the Jewish community, will be sorely missed. We send our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Barbara, his daughters, and the rest of his grieving family. Robert S. Rifkind, President David A. Harris, Exec. Dir.
