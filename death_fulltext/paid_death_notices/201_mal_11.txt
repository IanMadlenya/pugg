        ZARLIN--Martin. Marty to his beloved wife, Carole of 45 years, Dad to his adoring children, Brad, and Debbie and Scott Edelman, Pop to his beloved grandchildren Rebecca and Zachary, and Dr. Z. to more than 40 years of dental patients. All will remember blue skys, sunny days, your kindness, your laughter and your steadfast smile. There was none who appreciated every moment more or who was more loved. His sudden passing leaves us all bereaved. Services Friday, 10:30AM, Temple Israel Center, 280 Old Mamaroneck Road, White Plains, N.Y. Donations may be made to a charity of your choice.
