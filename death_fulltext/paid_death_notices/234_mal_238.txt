        NICHOLAS--James, M.D. On July 15, 2006. The Hess family is deeply saddened and mourns the loss of their dear friend, Dr. Jim Nicholas. He was a great man, a great friend and a great doctor who was part of our extended family for more than 50 years. Leon Hess was very proud to be involved in establishing the Nicholas Institute of Sports Medicine at Lenox Hill Hospital. Our family sends their heartfelt condolences to his beautiful and beloved wife, Kiki; his son Philip, his son Stephen and wife, Eileen, his daughter Nicole and husband, Charles and nine beloved grandchildren. We loved him deeply and will miss him enormously. Norma Hess Susan and John Hess Connie and Sankey Williams Marlene Hess and Jim Zirin
