        ABRAMS NEHEMIAH -Elaine. Wife of the late Milton Nehemiah. Soulmate to her cherished Sidney Abrams. Loving mother of Michael and Roberta Abrams, Linda and Jerry Gershon, and Mark Abrams. Adored Nana to Gary and Jill, David and Nicole, Laurie and Mike, Seth, Jeffrey, Jason and Kelli. Proud great-grandmother to nine at last count with yet another one on the way. Her family revels in her 85 years of life ''peppered'' with kindness and inspiration. Those of us who love and miss this much beloved woman take comfort in knowing that ''a cup of coffee from the urn, not the pot,'' is waiting for her. Services are on Sunday at 11:30 A.M., Robert Schoem's Menorah Chapel, W-150 Route 4 East, Paramus, NJ.
