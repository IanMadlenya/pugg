        ROTHSTEIN -- Edward Ha rold. July 9, 2003. Abiding love, fierce loyalty, generosity of spirit incarnate. A man among men, Dad was my mentor, my guide, my strength, my confidant. All I need to do is to reach deep into the very best part of myself, and there I will always find him, for love is stronger than death. From his daughter, Patty >>AD#
