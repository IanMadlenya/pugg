        FALK-Lee. We mourn the loss of our dear friend and esteemed member. A Lifetime Director of The Players, he was a great man of the theater, a legend among cartoonists and a great bon vivant. His figure loomed large for all of us. His counsel, wisdom and wit will be forever missed. Our love and sympathies to our fellow Player, Elizabeth and the Falk family. The Players
