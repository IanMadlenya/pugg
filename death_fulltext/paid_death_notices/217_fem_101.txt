        ROBBINS--Mary. The entire Northern Westchester Hospital family mourns the passing of Mary Robbins, a dynamic and steadfast leader, volunteer and friend who served our hospital with her distinctive blend of caring, wit and grace for over 59 years. She was an important part of the fabric of our lives in many ways--in the board room, throughout the hallways and with patients and is credited with major contributions to the excellence and quality of patient care. She will be deeply missed. Frank P. Brosens, Chairman Joel Seligman President and CEO Northern Westchester Hospital, Mount Kisco, NY
