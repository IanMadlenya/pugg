        SUNA-Rabbi Isaac. The Yeshiva University family mourns the loss of a highly respected member of the faculty of its affiliated Marsha Stern Talmudical Academy/YUHS for Boys. For more than 40 years, he taught and inspired his students, guided their intellectual and spiritual growth, and nurtured their understanding that they represent the future of their people and faith. He served as a role model of integrity, modesty, and quiet dignity. His accomplishments as a teacher and his personal commitment to the traditions of Israel will be preserved through the thousands of students who were blessed to have him as their mentor. Sincerest condolences to his wife, Odette; children, Rochelle, Hillel, and David; and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University Dr. Michael Hecht, Dean YUHSB Julius Berman, Chairman RIETS Board of Trustees Dr. Felix L. Glaubach, Chairman YUHS Steering Committee
        SUNA-Isaac, Rabbi. The administration, rebbeim, faculty and students of Yeshiva University High School for Boys mourn the loss of our beloved Rebbe, teacher, and friend, Rabbi Isaac Suna zt'l. Emerging from the fires of the Holocaust, he devoted his life to his students-his children. His strength, wisdom, kindness, patience, humility and boundless love for all were and are a constant inspiration.
