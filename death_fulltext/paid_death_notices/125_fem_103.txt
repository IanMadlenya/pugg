        BLUM-Eleanore. For over half a century she led and inspired Recreation Rooms and Settlement, an agency chartered by the State of New York in 1905 for charitable and benevolent purposes, ''to do general settlement work and any and all other works of any nature and description whatsoever''. Under the RR&S banner thousands were served in First Street Settlement House, in the country camps Mikan, Recro and Wildwood and two community centers in NYCHA projects Lillian Wald and Breukelen in daycare, headstart, teen and after-school programs. Ella Blum was always there for the children, the poor, the elderly and the ill. We mourn the loss but celebrate her dedicated life. She will be remembered.
