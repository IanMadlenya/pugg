        HERZOG-Chaim. The American Friends of Bar-Ilan University mourn with world Jewry the passing of one of the greatest coreligionists of the century, the sixth president of the State of Israel, Chaim Herzog. From his parents and his paternal and maternal grandparents he was blessed with a wealth of gifts that he dedicated to the people and the State of Israel in war and in peace. Fortunately for us, he completed and published his autobiography before he breathed his last, and that is a testament to his greatness and legacy for all of us to emulate. To his beloved wife Aura and all the family we extend sincerest condolences. His memory is eternal as is our people. Rabbi Emanuel Rackman, Chancellor Jane Stern Lebell Pres., American Friends Gen. (Res.) Yehuda Halevy Executive Vice President Bar-Ilan University
