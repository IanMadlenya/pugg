        LEWIS--Harold. The Hunter College Community notes with sorrow the passing of our former Dean, who headed the School of Social Work from 1970 to 1990. Dean Lewis took a fledgling institution and, through his inspired leadership and creative vision, helped it grow into an outstanding urban public school of social work. His intellectual curiosity sparkled both in the classroom and in spirited exchanges with colleagues at the School & at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, where he was the first social work Fellow. His unique blend of wisdom, wit & common sense are well-remembered and will be missed by many. We extend our sympathy to his wife Celia, daughters Amy & Beth, and family. Jennifer J. Raab, President Bogart R. Leashore, Dean Faculty and Staff of the School of Social Work
        LEWIS--Harold. The Board and staff of the Brookdale Center on Aging of Hunter College mourn the death of Hal Lewis. As Dean of the School of Social Work, Hal gave us wise counsel, support and office space during our early years. He was a good man and a great social work educator.
