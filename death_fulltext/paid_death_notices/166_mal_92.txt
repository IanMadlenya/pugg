        TUCKER-Harrison E. The Baruch College community records with sorrow the death of Associate Professor, Harrison E. Tucker, the founder and long-time chairman of the Department of Black and Hispanic Studies. Born in Africa, Professor Tucker had a distinguished career as a magistrate and member of the diplomatic corps in his native Sierra Leone before joining Baruch in 1970. He remained an eloquent and dedicated teacher until his retirement in 1999. Our deepest sympathy goes to his wife Harriett, his children Arvette and Kanei, his grandchildren, and all his large, extended family. President Edward V. Regan, and The Faculty and Students of Baruch College
