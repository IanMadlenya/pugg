        EMMANUEL--Betty C. died peacefully on December 21. Born August 20, 1917 in New York, the city she loved. Devoted wife of the late Costa and adoring mother of Nicky and Jill. Remembered for her strength, common sense, and elegance. But above all, it was her devotion and un-conditional love for her children and the joy she gave them that set her apart. She will forever be in their hearts.
