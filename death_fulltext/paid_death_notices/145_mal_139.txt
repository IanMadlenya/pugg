        CONWAY-James E. The President, Trustees and the entire Manhattan College Community acknowledge with profound sorrow the passing of James E. Conway '54. He was a valued and trusted Board member who gave his time and expertise generously to his alma mater. Jim was a senior partner at the law firm of Conway, Lavelle and Finn and cofounder and chairman of Ayco Corporation (sold to American Express in 1983), a national financial counseling firm. Past chairman of the Board of Trustees of Albany Law School and St. Peter's Hospital, Jim also served as director of the Northeastern New York Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the Boston Company. His time was also given to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany. A retired captain in the U.S. Air Force, he was admitted to the New York Bar in 1960. The College extends its heartfelt condolences to Jim's wife, Ricky, and their six children.
