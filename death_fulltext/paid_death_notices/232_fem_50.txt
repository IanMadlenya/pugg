        THERING--Sister Rose. The Anti - Defamation League mourns the passing of Sister Rose Thering, our dear friend and colleague in promoting Christian - Jewish relations. She understood early in life that anti - Semitism was wrong and devoted herself to working against it. For her seminal role in convincing the Vatican Council II to repudiate the centuries-old charge of deicide against the Jewish people, and her years of teaching the lessons of the Holocaust to students of all ages, ADL honored her with its Cardinal Bea Interfaith Award. A Woman of Valor, Sister Rose changed the course of history through her words and her deeds and set a standard for people of all faiths to emulate. Her legacy resides in all those she taught and touched. We extend our deepest condolences to the entire family. Barbara B. Balser, National Chair Abraham H. Foxman, National Director
