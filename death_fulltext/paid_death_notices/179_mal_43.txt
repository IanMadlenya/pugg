        RIEGNER-Gerhart, Dr. The American Jewish Committee mourns the death of Dr. Gerhart M. Riegner, the former General Secretary of the World Jewish Congress. He is best remembered for his historic 1942 cablegram from Geneva that first alerted American religious and political leaders to the systematic mass murder of Jews in Europe. Stunned by the world's indifference to the Holocaust, Dr. Riegner became an extraordinary champion of universal human rights and a global leader in ChristianJewish relations. He was a trusted and beloved colleague of the AJC in so many significant efforts, especially within the International Jewish Committee for Interreligious Consultations, a group he helped establish in 1971. During his long and distinguished career that spanned nearly 70 years, Gerhart Riegner always remained an authentic original-erudite, vigorous and creative. We will miss his warmth, wisdom, and leadership. We extend our deepest sympathies to his family. Harold Tanner, President David A. Harris, Executive Director Rabbi David Rosen, Director, International Interreligious Affairs Rabbi A. James Rudin, Sr. Interreligious Affairs Adviser American Jewish Committee
        RIEGNER-Gerhart M. The World Jewish Congress mourns the passing of Gerhart M. Riegner, one of the giants of Jewish history, who sought to alert an unbelieving world to the horrors of the Holocaust. As WJC representative in Geneva in 1942, his now famous cable to the West revealed the Nazi plan for genocide. In the postwar years as World Jewish Congress Secretary General, he was at the forefront of interfaith dialogue, participated in the rescue of North African Jewish communities, and was central to the elaboration of Human Rights instruments at the United Nations. His moral warning to the world remains relevant today. Edgar M. Bronfman, President Israel Singer, Chairman, Governing Board Evelyn Sommer, Chairman, American Section Elan Steinberg, Exec. Director
