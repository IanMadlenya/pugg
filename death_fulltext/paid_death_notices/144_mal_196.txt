        CORSER-Paul. The Board of Directors and staff of the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition (AVAC) express our deep sadness at the loss of our colleague Paul Corser, Program Officer at the American Foundation for AIDS Research (AmFAR). In the struggle to end the AIDS epidemic, Paul was smart, dedicated, and real. He will be missed by many. Our sympathies go to his family and coworkers at AmFAR.
