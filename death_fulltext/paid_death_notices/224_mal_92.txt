        ROWE--John Jay, Jr. Died Sunday, August 28 at his home in Amagansett at the age of four score and seven. He and his wife, Diana Cutler, were married in 1941 and spent many years summering in the Devon Colony until he retired and became a full time resident. His family of five children and eight grandchildren will cherish the legacy that he created. Born in Cincinnati, he was the youngest son of Grace Probasco Rowe and John Jay Rowe. He attended Cincinnati Country Day School, Middlesex and Harvard, Class of 1940. He served his country in W.W. II as an Army Captain and spent his career at Procter & Gamble. Best known to the locals as the creator of ''Ferryland''--John Rowe was a friend to all; he opened his door and knowledge, wit and a youthful spirit poured out. Our hearts are at half-mast but his wishes were resolute, ''Let no moaning be, as I put out to sea.'' The memorial service will be on Saturday, October 8, at Spring Grove Cemetery, Cincinnati, Ohio, in the Norman Chapel 10:30 AM.
