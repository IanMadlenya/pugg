        WURZER--Gerhard. April 30, 1941-April 8, 2007. Members of the International Fine Print Dealers Association mourn the untimely passing of esteemed friend and colleague Gerhard Wurzer, an internationally respected dealer of 19th and 20th century prints, paintings and drawings. Since its inception in 1980, his Houston-based gallery was celebrated for its impressive exhibitions of historical masters as well as contemporary artists. He was widely admired for his connoisseurship, forthright demeanor and joie de vivre. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his family and the many people whose lives he touched. In lieu of flowers donations can be made to the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Texas Gulf Coast chapter.
