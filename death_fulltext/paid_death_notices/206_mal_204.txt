        HALL--Robert H. of Wyckoff, NJ. Sailor, student, athlete, loving husband, beloved father, grandfather and great grandfather, beloved brother, respected business executive, mentor, volunteer and benefactor passed on Sunday, March 14, 2004. He was a devoted family man who invariably put his family ahead of himself. He was widowed in July '97 (Mimi Juppe) and leaves behind four children (Candace, Robert, Christopher, Bettina), seven grandchildren, one great grandchild and a number of friends scattered around the globe. Mr. Hall lived his life as though Teddy Roosevelt's famous ''Man in the Arena'' quote was written with him in mind. He ''...strove valiantly; ...knew great enthusiasms, great devotions; spent himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knew in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he failed, at least failed while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither knew victory nor defeat.'' Friends and family may visit at the Feeney Funeral Home, 232 Franklin Ave, Ridgewood, NJ (201) 444-7650 on Wednesday 79pm. Funeral services will be held Thursday at Our Lady of Mount Carmel RC Church, 1 Passaic St., Ridgewood, where a funeral mass will be held at 10:45am. Burial will follow at George Washington Memorial Park, Paramus. In lieu of donations it is requested that a silent prayer be said for worldwide peace and harmony.
