        FEINBERG--Arthur W. Cohen Hennessey & Bienstock P.C. and its entire staff mourn the passing of Dr. Arthur Feinberg, the husband, best friend and true love of our founder, Harriet N. Cohen. As one of Arthur's many extended family groups, we will miss and never replace his intelligent nurturing, his wise counsel, and his calm approach to life's vagaries. Our only solace is the knowledge that we can continue to face our daily challenges by asking always ''What would Arthur do?'' Our hearts go out to Harriet's and Arthur's entire family.
