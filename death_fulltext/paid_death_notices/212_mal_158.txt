        BALAY--Roland (May 28, 1902--September 16, 2004). Knoedler & Company celebrates the life and mourns the passing of Roland Balay, grandson of our founder, Michael Knoedler, and President Emeritus of the gallery (1956-1976). Mr. Balay served artists and collectors with dedication and vision which continue to be an inspiration to this day. Our sympathies go out to his wife of 30 years, Felicie Trayman Balay, and to his devoted family.
