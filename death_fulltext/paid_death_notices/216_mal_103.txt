        SAKS--Alan. Alan Saks, businessman, social activist and advocate of urban Chicago, died January 4, 2005 at age 77. He is survived by his wife of fifty years, Esther Shava; daughters, Ruth, Beth (son-inlaw Scott Fithian), Jane (partner, Lynette Jackson), and Naomi; grandchildren, Sam and Sarah; sisters Sylvia Breeders and Mimi Cooper. Alan was President and CEO of Saxon Paint & Hardware, which was founded by his paternal grandmother in 1914. He developed the company to a 50-store chain across three states and in 1996 he sold off and closed the company. Alan and Saxon became known for pioneering the concept of the ''do it yourself trend'' in wallpaper, paint and home furnishings. He was a co-founder of the Business Executives Movement Against the War in Vietnam in the 60s. Their activism against the war earned Alan and Esther the distinction of being on Nixon's Enemies list. In the early 1970's he was a founding member of BPI (Business and Professional People for the Public Interest) and a past president and board member up until his death. He spent approximately 20 years on the board of Columbia College of Chicago, and served on the boards of the ACLU and most recently on the board of JCUA (Jewish Council on Urban Affairs). Alan grew up on the near west side of the city and always felt passionately about Chicago. As a child, he shared with his father a love and fascination with the diverse neighborhoods of the city. Consequently, as an astute businessperson and a social activist, he believed in the diversity, ethnicity and vitality of the city. He was committed to the communities beyond being a local retailer and participated in neighborhood-based initiatives, local public schools and chambers of commerce. At a time when there was rapid urban flight, he opened stores in neighborhoods which were being abandoned by the national chains, food stores, and banks. All of these neighborhood stores remained open until 1996. Alan was a lover of nature, jazz and a world traveler with his wife. He spent many weekends and holidays with his family at their beach house in the Indiana Dunes hiking, sailing, biking, swimming, and horseback riding. He was also an avid skier since 1965. His great energy, humor, generosity, enthusiasm for life and tenacity will be remembered and missed by many people.
