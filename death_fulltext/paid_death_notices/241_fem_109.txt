        THACHER--Barbara Auchincloss. The community and friends of Teachers College, Columbia University note with sadness the passing of Barbara Auchincloss Thacher, alumna, Trustee Emerita, former Vice Chair of the New York City Board of Education, and recipient in 1992 of the College's Cleveland E. Dodge Medal for Distinguished Contribution to Education. Barbara was an indefatigable promoter and defender of the welfare of both the College and the children we serve. We will miss her energy, her intellect, her guidance and above all, her good spirit. Our condolences to her children and many grandchildren.
