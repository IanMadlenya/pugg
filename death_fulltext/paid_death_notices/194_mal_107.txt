        AYRES-Dr. Jose Marcio. The Board of Trustees and the Staff of the Wildlife Conservation Society are deeply saddened by the loss of their distinguished senior conservationist, Dr. Jose Marcio Ayres. For over 20 years, Dr. Ayres worked with local people to protect the wildlife and wild places in his native Brazil. His efforts resulted in the protection of thousands of acres of rain forest in the Amazon basin. Our world is a richer place due to his unflagging dedication. We extend heartfelt sympathies to the Ayres family. David T. Schiff, Chairman Dr. Steven E. Sanderson President
