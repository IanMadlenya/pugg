        LEHMAN-Sidney.

Lehman and daughter-in-law Pamela Gimbel Lehman; grandson Nicholas and his wife Tracy; and to grandson Zachary, his wife Amy, and their son Mitchell. Sidney Lehman, husband of the late Henrietta Lehman, was 89 years old at the time of his death. He lived until recently in Hollywood, FL.
