        ARONOWITZ-Florence. The entire Boys Town Jerusalem family mourns the loss of a very special friend, wife of our esteemed Board member, Gil Aronowitz, who considered our students ''her'' boys. Florence was a partner in life and tzedakah with her beloved husband and they transmitted to their children and grandchildren the lofty values of chesed and caring and doing for others. Florence personified the Biblical teaching: ''You shall choose life.'' Even in face of adversity, she was a pillar of strength, determination and faith. She was the dynamic force who, with love and devotion, weaved a beautiful family tapestry. Her memory will endure as a lasting bond and inspiration. May the entire family be comforted amoung the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Rabbi Moshe Linchner, Dean Michael J. Scharf, President Raphael Benaroya, Chairman Josh S. Weston, Honorary Chair Rabbi Ronald Gray, Exec VP
