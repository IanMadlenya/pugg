        GUSSEN--Ruth, M.D. Beloved mother of James Gussen, sister of Dr. Raymond Marcus and long-time companion, Professor Philip Levine, passed away December 31, 2003 in Los Angeles, after a long bout with cancer. She was a full professor of pathology at the UCLA Medical School and a nationally recognized authority on ear pathology, whose discoveries and insights broke important new ground in her field. After retirement, she joined the Plato Society at UCLA, where she became a beloved teacher on operatic subjects, and went on to serve as its president. She died at home surrounded by friends and family. She had a natural inner light that shone on all who came in contact with her, and she will be sorely missed by the many people who loved her. Memorial services will be held at 2PM Saturday, January 10th at 10790 Wilshire Blvd, Los Angeles, CA. Donations may be made to the Plato Society, 1083 Gayley Ave, Los Angeles, CA. 90024.
