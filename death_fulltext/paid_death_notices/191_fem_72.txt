        SPELKE-Estelle. Born in Englishtown, NJ, November 29, 1916, and was a wonderful part of our lives until November 21, 2002. Lived in Great Neck, NY, and then Tamarac, FL. Will be enormously missed by children Karen, Michele, Ken and grandchildren Robin, Tamara, Dawn and Pam, and so many whose lives she touched. Her never ending pleasure in the arts, music, language, her interest in world affairs, and her devotion to her family will never be forgotten.
