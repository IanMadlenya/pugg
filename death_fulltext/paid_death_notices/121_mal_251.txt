        GUTHRIE-Henry B. The trustees, administration, physicians, and staff of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center note with sadness the death of their distinguished, longtime, trustee and loyal friend. In 1953 he joined the board of Woman's Hospital, serving after its merger with St. Luke's Hospital as trustee and chairman of St. Luke's and, subsequently, as trustee and honorary trustee of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. We extend deepest sympathy to his family. Lawrence S. Huntington, Chairman Ronald C. Ablow, M.D, President
