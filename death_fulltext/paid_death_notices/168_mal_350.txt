        BRANN-Bob. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of beloved friend and colleague, Bob Brann, who served the company as an usher for nearly half a century. His Met career began at the Old House in 1953 and continued through this season, spanning nearly 14,000 performances. A fixture at his customary post on the orchestra left aisle, he was always ready to provide assistance and a warm smile. His service to our company was invaluable and he will be sorely missed. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Susan, and his family. Joseph Volpe, General Manager James Levine, Artistic Director
