        BENGUALID-Rachel. The Board of Trustees of Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary, an affiliate of Yeshiva University, is saddened by the passing of a highly respected member of the Sephardic community, beloved mother of our Trustee Henri Bengualid. YU Guardians and RIETS Fellows, he and his late wife, Sylvia, established the Jacob S. Knafou Memorial Scholarship for Sephardic Students at RIETS. We extend our heartfelt condolences to children, Henri and Jacob (and Margot) Bengualid; grandchildren, Dr. Victoria Bengualid (and Gabe) Goldstein and Marc (and Beth) Bengualid; great-grandchildren; and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Min hashamayim tenuhamu. Dr. Norman Lamm, President, YU and RIETS Julius Berman, Chairman, RIETS Board
