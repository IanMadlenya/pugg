        GRUSS-Regina. The Abraham Joshua Heschel School mourns the passing of Regina Gruss, whose extraordinary grace and dignity inspired us all. She was friend and supporter of our School from its founding. To Riane Gruss, her daughter-in-law and our Vice President and cherished Board member, and to Emanuel Gruss, her son and the School's esteemed adviser and benefactor, and to the entire family, we express most heartfelt sympathies. Her memory will be a blessing forever. Terry Ann Krulwich, President Roanna Shorofsky, Director Peter A. Geffen, Founder
