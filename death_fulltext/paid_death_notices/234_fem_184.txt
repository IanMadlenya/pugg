        TRAVELSTEAD--Edythe M. On June 11th, 2006, the world lost a brilliant, accomplished, courageous, dynamic person with a zest for life and a commitment to her community. Edythe M. Travelstead, a woman of valor, lost her valiant sight with breast cancer in her 64th year. Edythe was a survivor and she will continue to survive in the story telling of her deeds and in the hearts and souls of all who knew her. She is loved and remembered by her family Stephanie, Paul, Ari, Jennifer, Meryl, Jack, and her beloved and devoted friends. Rest in Peace, Bella. Donations to the Edythe M. Travelstead Foundation for the treatment of breast cancer at Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA would be greatly appreciated.
