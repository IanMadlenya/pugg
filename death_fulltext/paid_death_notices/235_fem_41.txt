        FELDMAN - FISCHLER--Len ore. The National Council of Jewish Women is deeply saddened by the loss of a distinguished leader and dear friend, Lenore Feldman-Fischler. Lenore dedicated herself to improving the lives of women, children, and families here and in Israel. During her tenure as NCJW president (1987 - 1990), NCJW launched the National Family Day Care Project, the Work/ Family Project, the Raising America's Children Campaign, and the NCJW Choice Campaign. Lenore was a featured speaker at the 1989 March for Women's Equality/ Women's Lives. She served as president of NCJW's Peninsula Section, an officer of the International Council of Jewish Women, and a board member of the NCJW Research Institute for Innovation in Education at Hebrew University. Her work and spirit will remain an inspiration to us all.
