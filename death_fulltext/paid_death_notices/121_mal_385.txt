        ALBEN-Miles H., 97, in Los Angeles where he lived for the past six years, now reunited with his wife of 68 years, Sylvia, who passed away in April of 1996. He will be remembered by son Russ of Los Angeles, daughter Rhoda Alben-Aronson of Riverdale, New York and five grandchildren: Seth Aronson and Ted Alben of Los Angeles, Dr. Daniel Aronson of Lutherville, MD, Nancy Torellas of Manhattan, and Alex Alben of Mercer Island, WA. Miles took pride in eight great grandchildren: Brandon, Cameron, and Sutton Aronson of Los Angeles, Joshua & Rebecca Aronson of Lutherville, Rachel Alben of Charlottesville and Emily and Jeremy Alben of Mercer Island. An Attorney, he was respected as an authority in Real Estate matters in the Motion Picture industry in a thirty-five year career as General Counsel for Warner Brothers Pictures in New York starting in 1928. He was an industry pioneer in the introduction of Employee Benefits in the early thirties. An active supporter of Jewish Community causes, he was the founding President of the Cinema Lodge of B'Nai Brith and organizer of a group that helped escapees from Nazi Germany in 1932. With an encyclopedic knowledge and a photographic memory, he was a leading figure in Anti-Trust Litigation activities of the Movie industry in the 1940s. His lifelong commitment to the importance of higher education led him to establish the Midwood High School Scholarship Fund, making it possible for many gifted students to accept academic scholarships which they may have otherwise had to forego because they lacked minimal funds for travel, clothing, and books. He retired in 1968 as a Vice-President of the Stanley Warner Corporation, the company that assumed management of the 400 Warner Brothers Theaters he had worked with for decades. Burial at New Mount Carmel Cemetery in New York, on Friday.
