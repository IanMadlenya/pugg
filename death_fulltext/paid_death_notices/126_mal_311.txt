        SCOLA-John Bobby. We mourn the passing of John Bobby Scola, a devoted member and officer of the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers (BAC) for 76 years and former business agent for BAC Local 9 New York. Scola, 94, was active in International Union affairs since he attended his first convention in 1936. BAC is the oldest international union in North America, founded in 1865. It has 100,000 members. Until his passing, Scola served since 1980 as the Mid-Atlantic Regional Training Director for the International Masonry Institute (IMI), a joint labor-management trust of the BAC and its contractors. He was based at the Woodside Training Center in Queens. From 1940 until 1979, he served as business agent of former Local 9 New York (now part of Local 1), instructors who create innovative teaching aids for apprentices. We will miss his wise counsel, his friendship, his invaluable knowledge of our industry and his robust sense of humor.
