        FRISCHLING--Irving. Our sincere condolences to Rosely, Steven, and their families. To our dear friend, Cuppy: The love, caring and devotion you, Delly and your children showered on ''Pop'' surely was the reason he was happy and fulfilled these past several difficult years. In Pop's Washington Heights grocery store Cuppy, working side-byside his Dad throughout the 40's and 50's, learned from Pop's example the importance of kindness, consideration and caring for people of every station in life without distinction, and how to live one's life always acting as a ''mensch.'' You and Delly have now passed on this important legacy to your own children. No wonder your Dad was so proud of you, Cuppy. Audrey, Harvey, Eric and Mark Feuerstein
