        KRUGER-Joseph. The entire staff of the Mohawk Day Camps and the Home School mourns the passing of our beloved President whose vast camping experience and wisdom helped to guide our organization for more than 30 years. His profound commitment to the children we served and their parents was an inspiration to all of us who worked so closely with him. We extend our deepest sympathies to his family and friends. Barbara and Steve Schainman Directors
