        GORDON--Alice age 89 died Wednesday March 23, 2005. Born in Detroit, MI on September 24, 1915 of Samuel and Lena Zucker. Her mother died in the flu epidemic of 1918 and she was raised by a new mother, Fanny. She grew up in Washington, D.C., and the marches of the unemployed during the early years of the Depression touched her greatly, as did the ferment of the times. At age 18, she and her husband, Hyman Gordon, set off to save the world. She raised two children and worked as a legal secretary. Her true lifelong vocation, however, was the struggle to make the world a fair and just place. Even aged and halting, she marched against the war in Iraq, and took pride in casting her vote in the 2004 election against the man who now seeks to destroy the Social Security she fought to create. The great sorrow of her life was the loss of her beloved grandson, Danny Carboni, to cancer, at age 23. She had many friends, led a full life, and left the world better than she found it. Survived by her son, Martin Gordon of Forest Hills, NY and his wife Toby and their children Tina and Michael; her daughter Susan Carboni of Teaneck, NJ and her husband Franceso; her grandson, Peter Carboni of Los Angeles; and her brothers, Seymour Zucker of Maryland & Monte Zucker of FL.
