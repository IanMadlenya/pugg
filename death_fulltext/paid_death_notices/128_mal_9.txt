        KANTOR-Shepard. Dad, I love you and always will. You were my hero and my best friend. Someday I will recover, the nightmares will stop, and things will be back to the way they once were. But you won't be there. We will always, always remember you and your spirit will forever be with us. Every goal I score, college I get into, job contract I get is for you Dad. Love always and forever, your eldest son, Jacob Heyman Kantor.
