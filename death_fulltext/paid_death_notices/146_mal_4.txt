        CUNNINGHAM-Michael J. Born February 23, 1919, in New York City and passed on February 26, 1999. He was a highly decorated WWII veteran whose patriotism spanned his lifetime. A winner of Major Bowes Amateur Hour at the age of 17 (radio's equivalent to Ed Sullivan), Mr. Cunningham excelled as a vocalist, corporate president, lawyer and became notable in 1973 as a veterans' advocate with the proposal to the city that veterans and elderly needed homes with dignity. His proposal to the City of New York singlehandedly gave the City its solution in the highly controversial Forest Hills Housing Project on 108th St in Queens. He was shortly thereafter appointed as an administrative law judge with the City's Consumer Affairs Agency. Michael Cunningham is survived by his wife of 57 years Virginia, daughters Constance, Virginia and Catherine, son Paul and grandchildren Patrick, Mary, Eleanor, Matthew, Kaitlin and Alexander. Reposing Fox Funeral Home, Inc., Forest Hills, Sunday and Monday, 2-5 and 7-9 PM. Funeral Mass at Our Lady Queen of Martyrs Church, Tuesday, March 2, 9:15 AM. Interment Calverton National Cemetery.
