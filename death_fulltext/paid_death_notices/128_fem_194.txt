        MACNEIL-Jane Moore, on September 24, at 79, at her home in Manhattan. Daughter of the late Stewart Charles Moore and Edna Hart Moore of Aliquippa, Penn. A superb golfer, she won numerous awards and championships in her amateur career, including Pennsylvania and Ohio championships from 1936-1945. After relocating to New York City in 1955 with her three children, she established herself as the office manager for several prominent physicians, including the late Dr. Arthur Davids. Years of dedication and hard work allowed her to raise three children on her own in Manhattan, a feat of which she was certainly proud. Married in 1968 to Robert Paul MacNeil, noted industrial engineer and cousin of the current chief of the MacNeil of Barra clan. Survived by three children: Susan Greenbaum of New York City, a doctoral student at Union Theological Seminary & faculty member at Hunter College, Nancy Gordon of Wheaton, Illinois, senior labor attorney for United Airlines, and Stewart Moore Johnson, also of New York City, investment technology expert and head of Investment Information Systems for The Guardian, a major insurance firm. Also survived by a stepdaughter, Eleanor MacNeil Dozier of New York City, & grandchildren Joshua Greenbaum, Sarah Hart Greenbaum, Lawrence Johnson, Scott Gordon, Jennifer McBride and Whitney Gordon. Special thanks to her close friend Gerry Bird for his care and dedication in the last years of her life. A memorial service will be held at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue (81st Street), on Sunday, September 28, at 3:30 P.M.
