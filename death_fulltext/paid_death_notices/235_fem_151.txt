        SCHWARTZ--Ruth Efron. Beloved wife of Bill. Daughter of Max and Bertha. Mother of Gil and Michael, grandmother of Will, Nina and Brianna and loving friend and inspiration to all who were fortunate to stand in her light. For 35 years Ruth served the White Plains, New York, school system as a social worker who made a difference in the lives of generations of children, each of whom went on to be a better person because they knew her. Her sweetness, wit, good nature and intellectual passion were exceeded only by her fierce allegiance to those who stood up to oppression and her unprintable disdain for those who abuse their power in any form. To know Ruth was to love her and feel a sense of wonder and grace. She will always live on in the hearts of those of us who knew and loved her, and were loved by her, from here to Ireland and back again. Funeral services to be held on Thursday, August 24th at 10:00 A.M. at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 21 W. Broad St, Mt Vernon, N.Y.
