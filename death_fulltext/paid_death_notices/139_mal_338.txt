        MORRELL-Bruce. All of us at the Holocaust Memorial and Educational Center of Nassau County note with profound sorrow the sudden passing of Bruce Morrell. As a member of our Board of Directors and a supportive friend in so many ways, he will be missed and remembered by those who had the privilege of working with him. To his wife, RoseLee, and to his children, Scott and Stephanie, we express our heartfelt sympathy and the wish that faith will comfort them. Boris Chartan, President For the Board of Directors
