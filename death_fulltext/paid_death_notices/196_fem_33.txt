        OKA-Gertrude (nee Heller). Of Miami Beach, FL, died at home on May 3rd. Beloved wife of the late Judge Kenneth Oka, former Mayor of Miami Beach. Born in NYC, graduate of Hunter College. An accomplished linguist, Gertrude moved to Miami Beach in 1938 to teach Latin at the Lear School. As First Lady of Miami Beach, in the late 1950's and early 1960's, when it was called the World's Playground, Gertrude enjoyed greeting dignitaries in a catalog of languages. In the early 1960's, Gertrude taught herself Japanese, moved with Kenneth to Tokyo, and gave a speech in Japanese to the people of Fujisawa on behalf of the People-to-People Program. She will be remembered for her remarkable mind and unique style that was spare and contained before the word minimalism was spoken. She is survived by her children Basha Botnick (Daniel) and Michele Oka Doner (Frederick), of NYC, Stephanie Oka Freed and Jonathan Oka of Miami Beach, and three grandsons, Jordan Doner, Jeremy Kenneth Doner, and Randall Freed. Funeral services private.
