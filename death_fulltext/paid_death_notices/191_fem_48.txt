        BRIGHT-Mary. The Museum of Modern Art notes with sadness the death of curtain maker Mary Bright. Ms. Bright worked closely with the Museum on several projects, including the curtains in the 2001 exhibition ''Mies in Berlin'' and those that hung in the Museum's restaurant, Sette MoMA. She was a widely respected designer and her contributions to the field will be long remembered. The Department of Architecture & Design The Museum of Modern Art
