        ROBERTS--Lucille. Our love and deepest sympathy to Bob, Kevin, Kirk and Samantha. We will sincerely miss our very dear friend. Lucille was an extraordinary woman, a trailblazer in her field and a very true friend. Lucille was very talented and gifted in many areas--and a brilliant business woman. She was the true embodiment of the American dream. She was an inspiration in her zest for life, her determination that she could find a way to accomplish anything she put her mind to and in her deep devotion and love of her family and friends. Lucille was our best friend who could always be counted on. We love Lucille very much and will miss her always. Noreen and Peter, Ryan and Brendan Roth
        ROBERTS--Lucille. We extend our condolences to the family of Lucille Roberts. Werner, Nurit and Ariella Haase >>AD#
