        PERERA-George. The faculty, staff, and students of Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons (P&S) mourn the loss of our friend and colleague, Dr. George Perera. Dr. Perera graduated from P&S in 1937, and later served as professor of medicine and associate dean of the faculty of medicine at Columbia. He was an alumni trustee from 1974 to 1980. In addition to his interest in education, Dr. Perera was committed to advancing efforts for world peace. He was an active member of the American Friends Service Committee and went on missions to the Middle East, USSR, Cuba, Cambodia, and Vietnam. We extend our deepest condolences to his family and friends. Gerald Fischbach, M.D. Executive Vice President for Health and Biomedical Sciences and Dean of the Faculty of Medicine Columbia University Thomas Q. Morris, M.D. Vice President for Health Sciences and Vice Dean of the Faculty of Medicine Columbia University
