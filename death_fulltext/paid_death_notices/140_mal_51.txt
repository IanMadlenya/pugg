        FEFFER-Solomon. The entire Jewish Theological Seminary family records with sorrow the passing of Solomon Feffer, a prominent scholar, revered teacher and beloved mentor who, through his dynamic career and magnetic personality, influenced generations of young Jews. Dr. Feffer founded the Rebecca and Israel Ivry Prozdor at JTS, a supplemental religious school program for elite high school youths, and was among the early leaders in the establishment of the Conservative Movement's Ramah summer camps. A longtime member of the JTS faculty, he also directed the language department at George Washington High School in New York, instituting the study of Hebrew there, and later became a professor of Hebrew language at Rutgers University. He is survived by his wife, Bessie; two sons, Amnon of Los Angeles and Jonathan of New York City; four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. May his memory be for a blessing.
