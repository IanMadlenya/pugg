        LEVINE-Arthur J. Loved and mourned by his wife Rosalind, his daughters Nancy, Susan & Ketzel, his grandchildren, his sister Marilyn and family. A principled man of constancy & commitment to the causes he believed in and the people he loved. We are particularly proud of his advocacy on behalf of Soviet Jewry and women in the Conservative rabbinate. His love of Verdi, gardening, the ocean and the Yankees lives through us all. Funeral is today, at 10 A.M., Riverside-Nassau North Chapel, Great Neck.
