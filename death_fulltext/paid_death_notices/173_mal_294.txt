        SEGAL-William. How long did I go back with Bill? I collected rents for Bill's father. When he was still in school he became my accountant and remained my accountant, advisor, counselor and friend until we lost him. Sylvia and I feel the deepest sympathy for your loss, Andy, my continuing accountant, advisor, counselor and friend. Sylvia and Lew Lubitz
        SEGAL-William. Our heartfelt condolences go out to Andy Segal and his entire family on the loss of his father, William. Max Capital Management Corp N. Richard Kalikow Chairman
