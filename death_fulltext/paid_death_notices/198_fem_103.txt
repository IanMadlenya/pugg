        McCABE--Ruth. 92, on July 12, 2003, at the Nathaniel Witherell in Greenwich, Ct. Wife of the late Charles Bernard McCabe, Jr., former President and Publisher of the NY Daily Mirror. Born in Kielce, Poland. Mrs. McCabe emigrated to the U.S. with her family when she was four years old, and was a professional singer on the radio in Detroit in her late teens. At the same time as she was offered an entree to a career in vaudeville, her husband-to-be impersonated the part of a reporter and contrived to interview her. In short order, the interview metamor phosed into a proposal of marriage. She is survived by three sons, Charles B. McCabe III of Vienna, Austria, Robert A. of NY and Athens, Peter F. of Stamford, CT; her daughters-in-law, Waltraud, Dina, Georgiana, Caroline and Wendy; her granddaughter Caroline of Boston, MA and Anne of London, UK and her grandsons Nicholas of NY and George of Boston, MA. and her step grandchildren Susannah, Peter, Katrina, and Miranda Reide, all of the UK. She is survived by a number of nieces and nephews, including Seymour Levine of Detroit, MI and by her sisterin-law Elizabeth McCabe of Jackson, WY. A memorial service is tentatively scheduled for Sunday, July 27, at 4PM at the Putnam Cemetery. Further details will be provided via Fred D. Knapp & Sons, Greenwich, CT. In lieu of flowers contributions may be made to the Boy Scouts of America, PBS/WNET, or to the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation, Medicine in NY. >>AD#
