        LEAHY-Thomas F. The Board of Directors and members of the Broadway Association mourn the passing of their Chairman from 1995 to March 8th. Tom took the Association into the 21st Century well before the millennium and broadened its membership base. He had dedicated the rest of this year to orchestrating the celebration of the 100th anniversary of St. Malachy's Church, the Actor's Chapel. His caricature, hung in Sardi's, will remain a memorial to all those that loved him. Our sincere condolences to his family. Richard A. Basini, President Dennis Swanson, Vice Chairman
