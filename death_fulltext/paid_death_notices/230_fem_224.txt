        PHANG--Helen, R.N. Passed away peacefully on March 25 after a short illness. Helen was the doyenne of the operating room at the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, and in this role always gave both extraordinary care to her patients and equally importantly by her example taught an entire generation of doctors, nurses, and other co-workers to always try and function at their highest possible level. We will always remember her humanity and her skill. Jay Lippman, M.D.
