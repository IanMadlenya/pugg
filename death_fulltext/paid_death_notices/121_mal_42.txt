        CLAIRMONT-Maurice M. The American Friends of Tel Aviv University note with profound sorrow the passing of our esteemed friend, Maurice Clairmont of Geneva, Switzerland, on January 17, 1997. He was a member of the AFTAU Founders Circle of Friends and the International Board of Governors of Tel Aviv University. Dedicated to the development and education of Israeli musicians, he was a major supporter of the University's Samuel Rubin Academy of Music and recently established The Clairmont Hall, a new music auditorium. Through the Clairmont family's support of scholarships and competitions, countless musicians, performers and conductors have and will receive professional training at the worldrenowned Rubin Academy. Our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Angela, and his son, George, and family. Melvin S. Taub Chairman, Board of Directors Robert J. Topchik, President Jules Love Executive Vice President
