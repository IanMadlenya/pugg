        PHILLIPS-Catherine. With profound sadness and grief, the Phillip's family deeply mourns the loss of Catherine Phillips, cherished wife and life-long beloved mate of Perry Phillips. Adored, loving, beloved mother and closest friend of daughter Christine Phillips and son Wesley Poriotis. Loyal, loving sister of Clara, and deeply loved full sister of daughter-in-law of Barbara Poriotis. With utmost devotion and intense care she leaves her brother-in-law Chris and his family Guy, Sheila and Brett. Always embracive, warm, kind, generous of spirit, giving, supremely sensitive and supportive of the needs of others, Catherine provided a soothing, safe, open and non-judgemental, healing presence to her family and friends. Regal in bearing, she was democratic in principle, always on the side of those hurt and less fortunate. An aficionado of the Mets and the Cleveland Indians, this rare artist and landscape painter reflected a sensitivity on canvas only matched by the giving spirit with which she nurtured those in need throughout her life. She will be always in our hearts, an active, life-giving force and presence in our memories forever with us. Services will be held at St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church, 196-10 Northern Blvd., Flushing, NY, 10:00 AM on Saturday, January 20, 2001.
