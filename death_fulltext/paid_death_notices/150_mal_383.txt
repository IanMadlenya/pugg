        KENNEDY-John F. Jr. The Board of Directors, Staff and Consumers of F.E.G.S. extend their deepest sympathies to the families of John F. Kennedy Jr., Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and Lauren G. Bessette. John Kennedy Jr.'s deep commitment to persons with developmental disabilities particularly his work as founder of Reaching Up Incorporated and its Kennedy Fellowship Program, has made it possible for many, including F.E.G.S. staff, to receive training, mentorship opportunities, and Bachelor's Degrees. His unique contributions to the human services workforce and his quiet, effective leadership have benefited many. F.E.G.S. will strive to continue his efforts to improve the lives of people with disabilities and others in need. Joseph Stein, Jr. President and Chair Alfred P. Miller, Executive V.P./C.E.O Lee Rambeau V.P., Developmental Disabilities
        KENNEDY-John F. Jr. All persons living with disability and those who have worked to extend the opportunities of everyday life for those with disabilities mourn the passing of John F. Kennedy Jr. With Reaching Up, John demonstrated and used his leadership and commitment to advance the careers of countless workers and established a national model. His deep concern and compassion for persons with mental retardation, and for those with chronic illnesses who need the help of a caring society has lost a spirited voice and a true champion. Our hearts go out to his family and to the family of Caroline Bessette Kennedy and Lauren Bessette, who have suffered such a tremendous personal loss. Arthur Y. Webb, President and Chief Executive Officer Village Care of New York
