Interment private. Memorial service at The Interchurch Center Chapel, 475 Riverside Drive, at 120 Street, 3PM, Friday.

And this might stand him for the storms and serve him for humdrum and monotony and guide him amid sudden betrayals and tighten him for slack moments. ''Life is a soft loam; be gentle; go easy.'' And this too might serve him. Brutes have been gentled where lashes failed. The growth of a frail flower in a path up has sometimes shattered and split a rock. A tough will counts. So does desire. So does a rich soft wanting. Without rich wanting nothing arrives. Tell him too much money has killed men and left them dead years before burial...The People, Yes, Carl Sandburg.
