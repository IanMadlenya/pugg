        STERN-William M. The Officers, Trustees and staff of the Educational Alliance note with profound sadness the passing of William M. Stern, our dedicated trustee from 1973 to 2000. Will served on various program and standing committees throughout his tenure. It was only after he moved to Florida that he retired from the Board. He was a wise, gentle, compassionate and caring human being. Will's intelligence, integrity and vision were major sources of the Alliance's strength. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his loving wife.
        STERN-Will. The Board of Directors and Officers of the United Housing Foundation wish to express their sadness at the passing of their friend and colleague, Will Stern. A longtime member of our Board of Directors, Will was deeply committed to and a strong advocate for the creation of cooperative housing, affordable to working families. His voice will be sorely missed. Harold Ostroff, Chairman Harvey Sigelbaum, President David Smith, Secretary Ken Wray, Executive Dir.
