        RYAN-Peter J. The partners and employees of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson mourn the passing of former partner Peter J. Ryan who imparted to us and our clients wise counsel and much wisdom. We feel privileged to have benefited from his humanity, which embodied much of what was, and is, good about our law firm. We will always remember Peter for his exceptional qualities as a lawyer and friend, and for the humor and grace that made each of us proud to be his colleague. We extend heartfelt sympathies to his entire family.
