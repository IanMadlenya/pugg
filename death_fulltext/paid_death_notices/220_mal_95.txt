        WALL--Irving E. The Board of the Directors of the Shubert Foundation mourns the passing of their esteemed Director, Irving E. Wall.

We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Jeanette; his children, Donald, Barbara, Heidi and Beth; and his grandchildren, Tyler, Dillon, Will and Olivia. Gerald Schoenfeld, Chairman Michael I.
