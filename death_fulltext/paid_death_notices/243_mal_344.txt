        VALENTI--Jack. The Board and staff of Save the Children mourn the passing of our wonderful friend, supporter and board member, Jack Valenti. Known to most for his 38 years as visionary CEO of the Motion Picture Association of America, and as press officer in President Johnson's White House, we know him as a man passionate in support of the global fight against poverty and disease, a force in making the world better for all of its children. Our condolences to his wife, Mary Margaret and their children Courtenay, John and Alexandra and their families. Jack named ''A Man for All Seasons'' his favorite film. This title so well described him. Robert Daly, Board Chair Charles MacCormack, President Save the Children
