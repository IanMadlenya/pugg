        SCHWEIGER-Dorothy. With great sadness we mourn the passing of Dorothy Schweiger, beloved wife of Erwin. We share his loss and extend sincerest sympathies. Dorothy, always her book in hand, her wit, and smile graced our premises every summer day. Her active drive for charities like Westhampton Hospice-Save the Children Association-and ALS Foundation was constant-with dignity. We at Lacoquille-our family-and Dorothy was an integral part. Lacoquille-Westhampton Board of Directors Harry Ruchman, Pres.
