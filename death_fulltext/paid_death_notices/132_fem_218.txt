        HAYNES-Joy Hatton. Dear friends, we lost our Joy to cancer on January 10, 1998 at her home in Manhattan. She was a singer/actress to the cognoscenti; she was a wife and an agent/manager to her late beloved Tiger Haynes; and she was a loyal pal/ buddy/friend to a whole lot of people. You all know who you are. She is survived by her devoted sister, Betty Charland, of West Palm Beach, Florida, one niece and three nephews. Nobody was ever more suitably named than Joy, and nobody will be more missed. A Times critic once wrote that her act at Reno Sweeney was ''unusually well-rounded and provocatively realized''. We who loved her think her life was, too. A memorial event will be announced.
