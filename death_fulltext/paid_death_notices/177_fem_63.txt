        FRIEDMAN-Nathalie. We mourn the passing of our beloved board member, Nathalie Friedman. Beneath her modest demeanor was a woman of great strength and dignity, a person of powerful intellect. She accomplished much in her lifetime and garnered only friends and admirers along the way. We shall miss her fine presence; her hard work, balanced judgment and wise counsel; her thoughtfulness and kindness. We extend our deepest condolences to the entire family. Blu Greenberg, President The Executive Committee The Board of Directors Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance
        FRIEDMAN-Nathalie. We are joined in sorrow with Nathalie's entire family in mourning her untimely death. We admired her courage and dignity which, though challenged, never failed her. We will miss her friendship, her intellect and inquiring mind, and most of all her gentle presence. She leaves behind an incredible legacy in her children and grandchildren. We wish the family comfort from Jerusalem. The Newmans and Lindenbaums
