        HART - Geraldine. Passed away peacefully on September 26, at her home after a courageous battle with cancer. She was the dearly beloved wife of the late Arnold Hart. Cherished mother of Richard and Jane. Loving mother-in-law of Nancy and Robert. Adored grandmother of Courtney, Rachael, Justine, Amanda and Caroline. Devoted companion of John Koehler, and a loyal friend to many. In lieu of flowers, contributions in her memory may be made to cancer research through the American Cancer Society, 1 - 800 ACS-2345.
        HART-Geraldine. Our friendship was extraordinary. We shared deep confidences, celebrated family joys and reassured each other when spirits were low. Even while enduring the hardships of her own illness, she constantly reached out to others who were undergoing difficulties. Everyone who knew Geri was charmed by her grace and warmth. I loved her and grieve deeply with Jane, Richard, John and the family. Renee Fisher
