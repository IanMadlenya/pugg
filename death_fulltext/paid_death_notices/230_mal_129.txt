        WRAY--Joe D. MD, MPH. The faculty, students, alumni, and staff of the Mailman School of Public Health of Columbia University mourn the passing of Professor Emeritus, Joe D. Wray, one of the world's leading experts on child health. He was committed to medical and public health education and spent many years serving communities in Thailand, Colombia and Turkey. He was a dedicated teacher to countless numbers of students of the School and we will miss him. We send our deepest sympathy to his wife, Beth, children and grandchildren.
