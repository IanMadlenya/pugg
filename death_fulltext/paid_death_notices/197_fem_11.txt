        LIVERMORE--Rosemary J. 70, of Paramus, NJ, formerly of Brooklyn, NY, died April 10, 2003. Beloved sister to Elizabeth Frankland, Anna Fitting, the late Jane Hague and the late William Livermore. A long-standing employee of Lord, Day, Lord and its successor Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, LLP. So considerate, so large-hearted, so genial, so efficient, so radiating all the best things of life, it seems impossible that she is gone. But, a woman of Rosemary's kindly regard for people and enthusiasm for the wholesome and uplifting things of life can not die. She has by her innumerable kindnesses built a monument in the hearts of all those who knew her. She will be sorely missed. Please attend a Memorial Service for family and friends: Saturday, June 7, 2003, 2:00 pm, Grace Church Brooklyn Heights, 254 Hicks Street, Brooklyn, NY 11201, 718-624-1850 or www. gracebrooklynheights.org >>AD#
