        CAMPBELL--Neil A., 58, loving husband, father, brother, gifted educator, and world-renowned author passed away from complications following a heart attack on October 21, 2004. Dr. Campbell was a source of inspiration for many, and we are all better for having worked, lived, and laughed with him. Ever the visionary, Dr. Campbell leaves behind a rich legacy of scholarship and an immeasurable contribution to the education of millions of students of biology at the high school and college-level. To appreciate the sheer magnitude of Dr. Campbell's impact on biology education consider that over five million students have used his biology textbooks since 1987 and currently over 500,000 students use one of his books each year. His ''Biology'' is the most widely used English-language scientific textbook in the world, and has been translated into eight languages. Dr. Campbell's publishers at Pearson Education extend their heartfelt condolences to Dr. Campbell's loving wife Rochelle of Redlands, California, and daughter Allison Campbell of New York, NY; also his brother Ian Campbell of Reno, Nevada; brother-in-law Jeff Arnold and family of Mentone, California; and mother-in-law Eva Arnold of Redlands. To honor Dr. Campbell, Pearson Education is announcing a Memorial Scholarship Fund to recognize and support inner city students who, like Dr. Campbell, aspire to pursue an undergraduate education in the sciences. His work will live on with these students and the textbooks that will continue to shape generations of students. A memorial service will be held in November at the University of California, Riverside. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that contributions be made to: University of California at Riverside Foundation, Attention: Neil A. Campbell Fund, c/o Development Office, University of California at Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521.
