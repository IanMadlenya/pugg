        DUNCAN-Barbara D. The Board of Trustees, residents, staff and alumni of International House note with great sorrow the passing of Barbara D. Duncan. As a trustee since 1982, she enriched the life of this community through her great interest in Latin American art and culture, and she will be sorely missed. Our heartfelt sympathy is extended to her husband, Jack, and to their family. Paul A. Volcker, Chairman Donald L. Cuneo, President
