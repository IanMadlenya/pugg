        DICKENSON-Harriet Ford. Peter Martins, Eugene P. Grisanti, Chairman, Howard Solomon, President, the Board of Directors, dancers, and staff of New York City Ballet wish to express their deepest condolences to the family of Harriet Ford Dickenson. Her contributions to the Company touched our lives in more ways than we can count. She was a special member of the NYCB family and we shall long recall her many gifts to us.
