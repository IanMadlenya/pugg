        LYLES--James B., Jr. Died Saturday, July 25, 2004 from a heart attack in St. Vincent Hospital in Manhattan at the age of 81. James was a loving husband to his wife of 40 years, the late Enid G. Lyles and a caring father whose attention and endless gift of his previous, little, free time will never be forgotten. He was a compassionate and caring man evident by his choice of service during WWII as a Field Medic who landed on Normandy on D Day, and later during his 25 year career, as a social worker for the city of New York. James is survived by his son Philip who will miss him terribly.
