        CALLAHAN-Sheila MacGill. Writers House notes with great sadness the passing of our friend and former colleague. She was also a client, author of children's books including ''And Still'', ''The Turtle Watched'', ''The Children Of Lir'', and ''The Last Snake In Ireland''. And for adults, the mysteries ''Death In A Far Country'' and ''Forty Whacks''. Her father was the noted Irish author, Patrick MacGill. We will miss this talented, tough and tender woman. To her husband, Leo, her children, her devoted extended family, we express our deepest sympathy. And we join with them in celebrating Sheila's life.
