        LENGEMANN--George L. On February 5, 2006 at the age of 78. Beloved husband of Ruth C. Haupert-Lengemann. Loving brother of Dorothy Lengemann Walker and caring uncle of Wendy L. Walker, both of Virginia, and Dr. William H. Walker of Pittsburgh. George waged a valiant battle against cancer for over two years with his characteristic dignity, wry sense of humor and indomitable work ethic. A dedicated life-long New York Giants football fan, he would consider it ironic that Super Bowl Sunday was his last day on earth. George had a distinguished career in investment management and security analysis spanning more than 50 years. For the past 34 years, he had been Vice President of S.W. Childs Management Corporation. He was also Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Lengemann Capital Management Assoc., Inc. Earlier, he had been affiliated with Peoples Trust Company of New Jersey, Guaranty Trust Company, a predecessor of Morgan-Guaranty and F.H. Vahesing. A 1951 graduate of Hofstra University, he earned an M.B.A. from N.Y.U.'s Stern Graduate School of Business in 1959. His service in the United States Army as a military photographer in Europe fortified a life-long love of photography. A past Vice President and Treasurer of the N.Y.U. Club of New York, he also served as Treasurer of the Touchdown Club of America and was a Member of the Princeton Club in New York and the Sun and Surf Beach Club in Atlantic Beach, NY. Family will receive friends on Wednesday, 7-9pm and Thursday 2-5 and 7-9pm at Frank E. Campbell-The Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Ave (81 St). Funeral services Friday, 9:30am at Frank E. Campbell.
