        PAUL--I. H. It is with a heavy heart that we say goodbye to our colleague, friend and mentor, I. H. Paul. He was one of a kind--warm and playful, a wonderful clinician, who taught us all to think seriously about technique, especially to cultivate and honor our patient's autonomy. I. H. was also a man of diverse cultured interests. He played the piano at many of our departmental functions, both joyous and sad. For now, the music is silent. We honor his memory and extend our deepest condolences to his wife Edith and to his entire family. A memorial is planned for a future date. Elliot Jurist, Director and on behalf of the Doctoral Program in Clinical Psychology, CUNY
