        DeLEON -- Dorothy. The Smith, Winograd and Birke families express deep sorrow on the passing of Dorothy (Babe) DeLeon who was a dear sister, mother, grandmother, aunt and a devoted wife of Ted DeLeon. Dorothy had style and grace and she brought a beautiful presence and quick wit to all occasions. Dorothy and her husband Ted formed a lasting and loving bond and cherished every moment together. Our families will greatly miss her and always remember her youthful spirit that matched her nickname of ''Babe''.
