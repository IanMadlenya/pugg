        FREEMAN-Doris. Bar-Ilan University and its American Friends mourn the passing of Doris Freeman, one of our most cherished benefactors and friends. Together with her late beloved husband Maurice, she was deeply devoted to Bar-Ilan for a quarter of a century and served with distinction as Vice President of our Women's Division. The Freemans were Presidential Founders of the University and established the important Freeman Family Scholarship Fund in memory of their beloved son Stuart, which now also bears the names of his dear parents. Few have the charm and elegance that was theirs. The Freemans provided a regal quality to all our events in both New York and London. Their friends were legion, and with them we will greatly miss the Freemans. We share with their daughter Carole Gliedman, her husband Richard, and the entire family inspiring memories. May they be comforted among all the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Rabbi Emanuel Rackman Chancellor Charles Dimston Chm. American Board of Trustees Mr. Melvin Stein President, American Friends Brig. Gen. (Ret.) Yehuda Halevy Vice President, Bar-Ilan University
