        GUTERMAN-Dr. Simeon L. With deep sorrow the American Jewish Museum of Art and Culture mourns the passing of its Board Member Dr. Simeon Guterman. A distinguished and scholarly gentleman, his interests and writings encompassed classical medieval history and the history of law. A man of extraordinary humility and a sense of selfeffacement and modesty, Dr. Guterman worked closely with his dear friend, our former president, Dr. Solomon Simonson, in seeking to improve inter-group relations through exposition of cultural contributions of the Jewish people to humanity. We extend deep condolences to his beloved wife Bette & his devoted family, sister Hazel and his brother Abe. May the family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Hana Simonson, President. American Jewish Museum of Art and Culture
