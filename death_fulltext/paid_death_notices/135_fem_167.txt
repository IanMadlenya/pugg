        OLDENBURG-Lisa Turnure. On April 17th, 1998, at home. Deeply beloved wife of Richard E. Oldenburg and cherished daughter of Mrs. David A. Turnure.

        OLDENBURG-Lisa. Her neighbors at 447 East 57 Street will dearly miss Lisa Oldenburg, a wonderful woman. She loved the best things-flowers, gardens, books, conversation. Directness & kindness marked her everyday transactions, as did a certain mordant wit. When you were with Lisa you felt not only that she knew what mattered in life, but that, by a kind of marvelous osmosis, you knew it too. To her beloved husband Richard we convey our deepest condolences, noting too that Mrs. Oldenburg was held in high regard and affection by our building staff, whose sad faces this week have reflected our great loss. The 447th East 57th Street Corp.
