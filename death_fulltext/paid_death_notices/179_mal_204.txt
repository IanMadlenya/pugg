        MURPHY-Christopher J. The Boards, Faculty, and Staff of Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital are deeply saddened by the sudden passing of Chris Murphy, son of Joseph and JoAnn Murphy of Scarsdale, N.Y. Just 41 when he died of complications of juvenile diabetes, Chris was a wonderfully dedicated supporter of efforts to find a cure for diabetes. He and his family were visionary supporters of the establishment of the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center at Columbia Presbyterian, and active members of the Medical Center family. The Medical Center and others in the campaign against juvenile diabetes will always remember Chris's warmth and commitment. We extend our condolences to his many friends and family. Herbert Pardes, M.D. President and CEO NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital
