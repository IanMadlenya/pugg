        LEVITT--Mortimer. Your favorite classic work was Schumann's ''Warum?'' (''Why?''). And, you always asked why, never accepting conventional wisdom, or the bureaucrats who think they know, when they don't know. May your questioning style become pervasive in this too-accepting world. Sarah and Gideon Gartner
        LEVITT--Mortimer. We note with great sadness the passing of our good friend, Mortimer. His dry wit, strong opinions, appreciation of dance and his marketing savvy will be much missed. Our deepest condolences to Mimi Levitt and her family. The Board and Staff of The Joyce Theater
