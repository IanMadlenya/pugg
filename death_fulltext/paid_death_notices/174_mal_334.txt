        SHERMAN-Irving. The Officers, Board of Directors and staff of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) mourn the passing of our friend and mentor, Irving Sherman. His tireless efforts enriched the lives of those he knew and saved the lives of many who had never heard his name. Irving played an important role in enabling countless Jews to escape the Nazis and in getting urgently needed money to those Jews left in dire straits. Irving's direct activities with JDC stretched from the early 1930's well into the 1980's. As our Treasurer and a member of JDC's Board of Directors, Irving provided the type of leadership and counsel that made JDC a major force in Jewish Rescue and Relief. Principled and esteemed, his contribution and sacrifice will never be forgotten. Our condolences to his wife, Marie, and the entire family. Eugene J. Ribakoff, President Michael Schneider, Executive Vice President Jonathan W. Kolker, Chairman of the Board
