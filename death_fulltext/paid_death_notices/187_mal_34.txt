        KALAJIAN-Berge. William Wordsworth wrote in his Lyrical Ballads: ''The Poet binds together by passion and knowledge the vast empire of human society!'' And so did Berge Kalajian, whose passing we mark today with a supreme sense of loss, capture the high ground of rediscovery for anguished parents of Daytop over these 40 years. He restored to the art of parenting its good name, providing the tools to heal and strengthen as Founder of the Daytop Family Association. May a loving God embrace him as he arrives on Heaven's shore. (Msgr). William B. O'Brien President, Daytop Village Inc
