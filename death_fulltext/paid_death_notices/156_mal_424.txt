        GOTTLIEB-Jules. The Board of Directors and staff of UJA-Federation of New York are deeply saddened by the passing of Jules Gottlieb, a cherished friend and major supporter of our mission. Mr. Gottlieb left a legacy of hope for all those touched by his extraordinary generosity and concern, particularly the Long Island community to which he was especially committed. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Ann, and his children and grandchildren. May you be consoled among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair James S. Tisch, President Arthur M. Katz, LI Cabinet Chair John S. Ruskay, Exec. VP & CEO
