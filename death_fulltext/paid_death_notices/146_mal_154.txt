        WARDWELL-Allen. It is with great sadness that we mourn the sudden death of our friend. It is with smiling memories that we celebrate his remarkable life of scholarship, spirit, modesty and style. We honor his many accomplishments and express our gratefulness at having known him and shared his passion for Native American Art. To his devoted wife, Sally, and their children, we offer our condolences and love. Valerie and Charles Diker
