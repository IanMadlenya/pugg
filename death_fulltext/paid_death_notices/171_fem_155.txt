        MOSKOWITZ-Gloria Helen. On April 16, 2001, Gloria died and left her memory to her beloved family and friends. Her whole life cannot be captured in these words, but can be reflected in these images. Her lifelong love for the printed word is represented by her love for the Public Library of Interlaken, NJ. Her support for the total community and for individual friendship is reflected in her work with the Jewish Community Center of Deal Park, NJ. Her final days were made bearable by the love of her family and friends & the civilized effort of the Center for Hospice Care at the Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch, New Jersey. She will be remembered by all who knew her.
