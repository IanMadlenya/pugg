        $(6$)MAY -- Marcia Wolfson -- A beloved contemporay art consultant with a gifted eye for up-and-coming artists, died Wednesday July 26, 2006 in Dallas, Texas from complications from a pulmonary infection. She was 67. Marcia was born in Brooklyn and graduated at 19 from Boston University with a BA in education. She then taught kindergarten in Harlem. Shortly after marriage, Marcia and Alan moved to Midland, Texas and then to Dallas. There Marcia worked in public relations before turning her passion for art collecting into a full-time career, dividing her time between Dallas and Manhattan. Marcia was exceptionally gifted with people and had a wealth of friends around the world. Her extraordinarily generous heart, her free spirit and her endless adventures were legendary. She will be sorely missed. In addition to her devoted husband Alan, she is survived by her beloved daughter, Alexandra May and her two grandchildren, Tucker and Piper Drew of Dallas and her brother, Richard Wolfson of Minneapolis. At Marcia's request, no funeral or memorial service will take place. Instead her family will invite her loved ones to a celebration of her life in September both in Dallas and in New York City.
