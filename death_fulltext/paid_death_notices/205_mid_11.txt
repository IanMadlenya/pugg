        SENDERS--Pauline (Peppy). The Yeshiva University family is deeply grieved by the passing of the beloved wife of Yeshiva College Board member, Myer Senders (YC'46), who was a YU Guardian with him, and a devoted mother of a YU family, who was honored with her husband by Cleveland Friends of YU. Together they established the Myer and Pauline Senders Off-Campus Lecture Series. She was a lady of great grace, charm and spirit. Heartfelt condolences are extended to Myer and their children, Dr. Shelly YC'78, BRGS'79, AECOM '83 (and Debbie) Senders, Barbara SCW '82 (and Dr. Martin YC '81, AECOM '89) Ast, Tina SCW '83 (and Yeshiva College Board member, Shalom YC '81) Lamm, and Linda SCW '85 (and James H. YC '84) Joshowitz. May the entire Senders family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel, President Norman Lamm, Chancellor Ronald P. Stanton, Chairman YU Board of Trustees Joshua L. Muss, Chairman YC Board of Directors
