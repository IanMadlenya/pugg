        TAPLIN-Frank E. Jr. The trustees and staff of the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation mourn the death of our longtime trustee and benefactor Frank Taplin. A member of the Board from 1972 to 1993, Vice Chair for the last six of those years and since then Trustee Emeritus, Frank continued his active engagement and deep personal commitment to the work of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation to the last days of his life. Among his many important contributions, he played a key enabling role in establishing Teachers as Scholars, a program that now offers intellectual revitalization for K12 teachers at 26 universities nationwide. In establishing the new Frank E. Taplin Jr. Public Intellectual Award (an initiative that Frank enthusiastically supported), the Foundation celebrates Frank's lifelong dedication to the liberal and performing arts and to their relevance in the world of affairs. Frank was a wonderful inspiration and great friend to us all, and he will be greatly missed. We extend heartfelt condolences and deepest sympathy to his wife, Peg, and to their family. Nancy Weiss Malkiel, Chair Robert Weisbuch, President The Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation Princeton, New Jersey
        TAPLIN-Frank E. Jr. The Board, Staff and Musicians of the Princeton Symphony Orchestra mourn the loss of our colleague and friend. A founding trustee who sustained the organization in its earliest and most challenging years, his impact on our music, and indeed, the nation's music, cannot be calculated. John J. Hamel III, President Mark Laycock, Music Director Joshua Worby, Executive Director
