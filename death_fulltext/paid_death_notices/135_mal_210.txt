        FRIEDLAND-Jerry. The staff of Ambassador Construction mourns the loss of a most beloved member of our corporate family. Jerry was with us since 1977 and, as our Executive Vice-President, was instrumental in helping us grow from a tiny clan of 12 to the tight knit dynasty we are today, while retaining our traditional ''family values''. His calm manner and rational perception in the midst of chaos were always to be counted on. He was an icon of professionalism in his engineering, administrative and organizational skills and these earned him the respect of colleagues, clients, architects and subcontractors on projects ranging from elegant townhouses to a new, modern midtown atrium and indoor mall. He was an arbiter of good taste and left his imprint everywhere, from the design of our offices to our corporate image. His latest project was to update our logo to convey the growth and strength we have achieved over the years and to take us into the next century. His input was invaluable and the completed project will be a living monument to our friend and colleague. We send our love, prayers and support to his wife Benay, who he so cherished, and our deepest condolences to his mother Matilda and his brother Joel. He is finally at peace. The family has requested that in lieu of baskets, donations be made to the Mount Sinai Hospital, (designated on the check for Oncology Research, memory of Jerry Friedland) and sent to: Mt. Sinai Medical Center, Zmira Goodman, VP Development, 1425 Madison Avenue, Box 1049, New York, New York 10029 and advise notification to family.
        FRIEDLAND-Jerry. I will never be able to fully express my full affection and respect to my friend and close associate. I will miss you, Jerry. Jack
