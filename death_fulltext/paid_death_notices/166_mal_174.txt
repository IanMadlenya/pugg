        WALTER-Henry G., Jr. The Columbia University community mourns the loss of alumnus, friend, and benefactor Henry Walter. Hank, as he was affectionately known to Columbians, was a tireless supporter of Columbia's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. His recognition of the importance of climate research, decades before current issues emerged demanding that knowledge, speaks to his prescient insights. He is deeply missed, and on behalf of the entire University, I extend sincerest condolences to his family and friends. John Mutter Interim Director Lamont-Doherty
