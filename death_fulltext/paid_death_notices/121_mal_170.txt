        CUMMINGS-Paul. Paul Cummings' Connoisseurship and diligent efforts, together with the guidance and support of the Drawing Committee of the Whitney Museum of American Art, built the Museum's modest group of 20th century American drawings into one of the preeminent collections. I was privileged to work with Paul and observe that his demanding impatience brought out the excellence in others. His knowledge and scholarship were recognized in the pioneering exhibitions of Whitney Museum drawings held at the National Gallery of Art and the Ochenbach Foundation. I will miss a singularily provocative contributor to the art community and express my deepest sympathy to his family. Tom Armstrong Director Emeritus Whitney Museum of American Art
