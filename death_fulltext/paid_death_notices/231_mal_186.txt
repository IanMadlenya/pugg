        SHEA--Frederick T. Died April 14, 2006. Beloved husband of Evelyn, loving father of Brian, Kevin (deceased) and Kathleen, and caring grandfather of Keegan, Colby, Mitch, Christopher, Jonathan, Freddie and Jessica. Fred graduated from Regis High School and Went on to The College of the Holy Cross ('40), thence to Columbia Law School ('48) where he was a member of the Columbia Law Review. His studies were interrupted by military service when he was drafted into the Army early in World War II, and rose from the rank of Private to Captain. He served with the U.S. forces in the invasion of the Normandy beaches six days after the initial landing on D-Day, 1944. Following law school he joined the firm that is now Kelley Drye & Warren LLP, where he spent his entire legal career of over fifty-seven years, serving as the Firm's managing partner and as a member of its executive committee. Fred's law career was devoted initially to litigation, and subsequently to labor and employment law as a prominent member of the labor bar representing management. Among his clients were Chrysler Corporation, The New York Hospital, The New York Yankees, the Diocese of Brooklyn and Bridgeport and the Archdiocese of New York where he served as special labor counsel to Cardinal Cooke. He was admired, respected and beloved by his partners for many qualities, not the least of which was his unerring integrity. Fred served for nearly thirty years as a member of the Board of Trustees of St. Joseph's College New York, twelve years as its Chairman, and was instrumental in establishing the College's Long Island campus in Patchogue. He also served as President of the Loyola Council of the Weston School of Theology in Massachusetts. In lieu of flowers contributions may be made to The Frederick T.
