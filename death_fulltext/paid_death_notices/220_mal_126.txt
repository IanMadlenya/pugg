        CHAIKIN--Marvin, 88, of Chapel Hill, formerly of Great Neck, NY., May 9, 2005. Goodbye to our Marvin, a generous and gentle heart that had room for everyone: his wife, Nancy; his sister, Jeannette Harris; his extraordinary children, Robin Litwin, Peter, and Andrew; his devoted grandchildren, Jody Litwin, Amy Litwin and Molly Chaikin; his U.S. Navy shipmates and all Tarheels everywhere. His family thanks the Cedars Health Service and the University of North Carolina for their special care. May the great songs of swing music play our dear ''Mushy'' to heaven where he surely belongs.
