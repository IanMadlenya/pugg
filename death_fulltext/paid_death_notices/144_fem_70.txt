        HOWITT-Lillian. Will be deeply missed by Diane and Arthur, Neil, Michael, Adrianne, Mildred and many dear relatives, friends and colleagues. We will all attempt to carry on for her with the help of her countless friends. Lil inspired us with her great spirit. A true and truly good individual, always ahead of her time. An educator and principal, a devoted mother, grandmother, mother-in-law, aunt, sister and friend. To a powerful woman who believed in people, peace and humanity to all, we salute and raise our heads. We are proud and better people for having known Lil. Services Sunday, 12 noon at Riverside Memorial Chapel, West 76 Street and Amsterdam Avenue, NYC.
