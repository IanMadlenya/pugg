        DOUGLAS--John J., 89. Died peacefully March 9, 2006, after briefly suffering complications from a fall. His children were with him at the time of his death. Born in Chicago, John earned a degree in accounting from the University of Wisconsin in 1939, while also participating in their sports program and the Delta Upsilon fraternity, as well as working a steady job. He maintained the friendships he made there throughout his life. He served briefly with the Wisconsin Public Service Corporation, and in 1940 joined Theodore Gary and Company, Chicago, which later merged into GTE. At the time of his retirement in 1980, John had served 40 years with GTE and had attained the office of vice chairman. John married Jeanne McGauran (now deceased, April 2005) in 1944, when both began their life-long devotion to each other and to the seven children they raised, eventually celebrating their 60th wedding anniversary. John's career took the family from Chicago to California where he was named president of GTE Lenkurt Inc., in 1959. In 1963, John was appointed executive vice president of finance for GTE, which brought the family to New York, and then Stamford, CT. John was elected vice chairman of GTE in 1976. Upon retirement he and Jeanne moved back to California, where they lived in Woodside for over twenty years, before taking up their final residence in San Mateo. An avid fisherman, golfer, and sports fan, especially of football, John also enjoyed travel with Jeanne and his many friends, and planned many very special family trips. He is survived by his six children; John, Steve, Mary Douglas Benziger, Ann, Patty Douglas Wheeler, all of whom live locally, and Tom, from Westport, CT. Also surviving are his 15 grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. John was predeceased by his sister, Mary Krueger and son, Chuck.
