        KERLIN--Gil. The Trustees, administration, faculty, staff, students and alumni of Bank Street College of Education mourn the passing of Gilbert Kerlin. With his late wife, Sally, an alumna and long-time Trustee, Gil was a faithful and generous friend to the College for 50 years. We were privileged to share in his full and adventurous life. He will be greatly missed by all at Bank Street. Augusta Souza Kappner, President Sue A. Kaplan, Chair, Board of Trustees
