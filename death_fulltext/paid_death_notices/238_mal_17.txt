        MELTZER -- Joel Simon. Passed away Tuesday, October 31, 2006. Born in New York City, Joel served in Naval Intelligence in post World War II Berlin. Upon returning stateside he moved to Miami Beach and began a successful career as a Publisher's Representative. Over five decades Joel represented virtually every major newspaper and publishing group from Conde Naste to Hearst to the Washington Post. He used to say he knew when he had done a particularly good job for a magazine because they could fire him and take it ''in-house''. He was in the relationship business and over the years he amassed a large group of people that were pleased to call him friend. Joel had his own special table at Joe's right on the central aisle where he entertained friends and colleagues for decades. He always had the latest joke that he delivered in his own unique style. He was a gentle man who savored his friends and contributed to the richness of their lives in many ways. Joel is survived by his wife Tony Hope; his nephew Larry Meltzer; his niece Martha Heald; sister-in-law Sue Elkanick, grandnieces Abby Heald, Andrea and Heather Meltzer, Jamila and Johanna Perlas; and grandnephew Josh Heald and Kim Perlas. Services will be 12 noon tomorrow, Friday, November 3, 2006 at Temple Judea, 5500 Granada Boulevard, (at US1) Coral Gables. Call Levitt-Weinstein Memorial Chapel, 305-274-0641 for information.
