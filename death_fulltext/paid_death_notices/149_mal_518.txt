        GREENE-Barnett A., M.D. Age 91, beloved and loving husband for 66 years of Lee, died on June 28, 1999 at University Hospital at Stony Brook following open heart surgery. Barney was the devoted father of Stuart, who predeceased him in 1997, and of William, whom he inspired into medicine; father-in-law of Sherry and Beverly; and grandfather of Douglas, Stephanie and Bradley and of Ilyssa, David and Lauren. He was an indomitable spirit whose intellect, humor, generosity and force of personality made him unforgettable to all who knew him and successful at all he touched. He worked his way through City College graduating Phi Beta Kappa and through NYU Medical School graduating Alpha Omega Alpha, becoming the first board-certified anesthesiologist in Brooklyn. He served in the Army Medical Corps in World War II in North Africa and Italy and emerged a major with a Bronze Star. He loved medicine and anesthesiology, built a 25-physician practice in 6 community hospitals in Brooklyn & became a nationally known expert medical witness. But mostly he loved Lee, his partner in ballroom dancing and in life. They danced through life together and epitomized that combination of romance, zest for life and shared interests that made them a pleasure to behold and a treasure to emulate. Lee, her family and their friends are bereft without him. His funeral is on Wednesday, June 30, 1999 at 1:30 PM, at Boulevard Chapel in Hewlett, 516295-3100.
