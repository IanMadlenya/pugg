        GRIFFIN-Jocelyn Crane. The trustees and staff of The Wildlife Conservation Society mourn the passing of their colleague and friend, who died in Concord, MA. on December 16, 1998. She was a zoologist and historian of human gestures in art. After graduation from Smith College in 1930, she joined the staff of the New York Zoological Society's (now Wildlife Conservation Society) Department of Tropical Research and began collaborating with William Beebe, beginning with research on deep sea fishes, based in Bermuda. Later she managed the Society's tropical field stations in Venezuela and Trinidad and was senior research zoologist with the Society's Institute for Research in Animal Behavior. She was an internationally recognized ethologist concentrating on the behavior of tropical animals, jumping spiders, praying mantises, butterflys and especially fiddler crabs, which she studied on many excursions around the world leading to her great monograph Fiddler Crabs of the World. During her retirement she turned to art history, obtaining a Phd degree from the Institute of Fine Art, New York University. She is survived by her husband, Donald R. Griffin of Lexington, MA.
