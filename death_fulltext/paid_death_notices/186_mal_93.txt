Kieran's wife Anne, sons Barry, Gavin and Kieran, his mother Anne, brothers Eamon, Micheal, and sister Anne Marie and extended family members would like to thank most sincerely our relatives, neighbors and friends for everything they have done for us since Kieran's death on September 11th, 2001. Thank you to everyone who sympathized personally, telephoned, sent Mass cards, perpetual enrollments, floral tributes, messages of sympathy, those who travelled long distances, attended Kieran's memorial, funeral Mass and burial, provided support and consolation or helped us in any way. A Special word of thanks to all the rescue workers who worked tirelessly to recover our loved ones, it was comforting to see the reverence and respect for the dead shown at Ground Zero. We are forever grateful. Thank you to all those people both in Ireland and New York who endeavored to help Anne and family re-build their lives. We were humbled by the goodwill shown by everyone. The holy sacrifice of the mass will be offered for your intentions. The Gorman Family
