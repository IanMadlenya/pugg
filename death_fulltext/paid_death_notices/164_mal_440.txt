        PASTER-Harry. The entire membership and staff of the American Association of Advertising Agencies mourns the loss of Harry Paster, who died Tuesday September 26 at the age of 74 after a prolonged illness. A former AAAA executive vice president, Harry was one of the most influential and colorful figures in the United States advertising agency industry. He spent his entire professional career at the AAAA, where for five decades he met and advised some of the biggest, most famous names in the American ad industry. Harry joined us in 1948 and was named vice president in 1966, senior VP in 1978, and executive VP in 1980. He provided valuable counsel to AAAA member agencies on management issues including costs and profits, benefit plans, compensation arrangements, contracts, succession plans, and mergers and acquisitions from 1980 until his 1995 retirement. The AAAA extends its deepest sympathies to his entire family. Services will be held Thursday at 10 A.M. at the Riverside Nassau North Chapel, 55 Station Plaza North, Great Neck, NY. A funeral will follow immediately at Beth Moses Cemetery on Pine Lawn Avenue in Farmingdale, New York. We'll miss you, Harry.
