        SPANOPOULOU-Eugenia. The students, faculty, and staff of the Mount Sinai Graduate School of Biological Sciences mourn the tragic deaths of a stellar member of the faculty, Eugenia Spanopoulou, her husband Andrew Hodtsev, and their son Platon in the crash of Swissair 111. Eugenia was a brilliant young scientist whose sparkling creativity and personality enlivened and enriched our entire program. Her scientific accomplishments were already remarkable. She was also a marvelous mentor for her students. She energetically engaged in the work of developing their talents, careers and developing the new programs in which many of them were training. She thus influenced so many of us and fostered enhancements that will be part of the powerful legacy of a grievously shortened life. We extend our profound condolences to Eugenia and Andrew's families. Terry Ann Krulwich, Dean Mount Sinai Graduate School of Biological Sciences Sharon and Frederick A. Klingenstein-Nathan G. Kase, MD Professor
