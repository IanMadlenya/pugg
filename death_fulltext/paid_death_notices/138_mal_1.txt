        GALEF-Steven A. We are all charged with the responsibility to help make the world a better place. Steve Galef aced that course. Steve was a master at finding the prudent, the enhancing and the positive. His integrity, sound judgement and professionalism were his bywords. He was strong, soft, energetic, even paced, compassionate and grounded. Steve served his country and his community with uncommon distinction. The world is a better place for his having walked through it. He will be missed for the remainder of our lives. We are blessed, however, by having touched Steve and, far more, by having been touched by him. Alice and Stanley
