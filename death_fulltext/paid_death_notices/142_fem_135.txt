        KOREIN-Sarah. The Board of Trustees, faculty, and students of the Rabbinical College of America mourn the passing of our dear friend and generous supporter, Sarah Korein. She was a shining example of hard work and perseverance, combined with graciousness and generosity, in a society thirsty for genuine role models and leadership. In 1997 the Rabbinical College conferred upon her an honorary doctoral degree. In a quiet and distinguished manner, she has contributed immensely to the development of a better society. May the Al-mighty bless Dr. Julius, Elysabeth, James, Jonathan, Beth, Peter, and the entire family with only good tidings and ''nachas'' in the days ahead.
