        KLOTZ-Ruth. The officers, Board of Directors and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Ruth Klotz, beloved mother of Martin B. Klotz, a dear friend of the Jewish community. Martin and his wife, Bobi, express their dedication to improving the lives of those less fortunate through their exceptional commitment to UJA-Federation. A compassionate leader who serves on our Board of Directors, Mrs. Klotz is extremely active on many committees at UJA-Federation and its beneficiary agencies. We extend our deepest sympathies to Martin and Bobi; and to the entire Klotz family. Larry Zicklin, President Morris W. Offit, Chair of the Board John S.
