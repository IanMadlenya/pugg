        MILLER--Marion C. On November 29. Longtime Brooklyn Heights activist, proud progressive Democrat and veteran, cherished wife and partner of late husband Benjamin, wonderful ''mommy,'' English teacher and breakfast partner to daughter-inlaw Marta, and best friend and confidante to son Andrew. She will be sorely missed by both of them and those still living who gave her much and received much and made her life the 821/2 year rainbow it was. Donations: Ben and Marion Miller Charitable Gift Fund, P.O. Box 788, West Dover, VT 05356.
