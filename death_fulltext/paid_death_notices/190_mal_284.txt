        WEINER-Leon N. We deeply mourn the passing of our great friend Leon N. Weiner. He was a man of enormous passion and intellect. As President of the National Association of Home Builders, he led the organization's support for affordable housing. As Chairman of the National Housing Conference, the nation's major housing lobbying organization, he was its spokesman on Capitol Hill for the legislative authorization and funding of affordable housing. As a result of his efforts, millions of Americans now live in decent housing. Nathaniel J. Parish, President Parish, Weiner & Maffia, Inc.
