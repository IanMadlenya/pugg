        HYMAN-Dr. Ruth Link-Salinger. The Yeshiva University family mourns the passing of a distinguished authority on religious and political philosophy and intellectual history, a renowned author and recipient of many scholarly awards. A former visiting professor of philosophy at YU, she was the wife of Dr. Arthur Hyman, dean of our Bernard Revel Graduate School and Harry Fischel School for Higher Jewish Studies, and the University's distinguished service professor of philosophy.
