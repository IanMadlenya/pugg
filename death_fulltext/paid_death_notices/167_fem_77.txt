        PRESSEL-Rosa (nee Himmelblau). Passed away Wednesday, December 6, 2000 at the age of 101. Rosa, devoted wife of the late Adolphe Pressel, was born in Belgium & came to the United States in 1939 where she settled in New York City and became an active supporter of several community and charitable organizations. She was a longtime, active member of Congregation Shearith Israel and its Sisterhood. Her work for the Dalton Community in Israel helped to establish an industry for the Moshav. More recently, her pet project has been Dorot, a local charity which provides food for the homebound. Mrs. Pressel was also an avid bridge master. Rosa has been a tremendous inspiration to both family and friends. She is survived by two sons, Paul and Raymond, five grandchildren, seven great grandchildren and one great, great grandson. Memorial contributions to the Sisterhood of Congregation Shearith Israel, or to Dorot would be greatly appreciated.
