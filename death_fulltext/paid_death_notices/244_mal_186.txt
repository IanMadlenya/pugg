        GLUCKSMAN--Trevor. Founder Wellfleet Pottery Trevor Glucksman, 82, husband of Kathleen, father of sons Maurice, Daniel and Tobias, and grandfather of four, passed away on May 15 after a long illness. Trevor is also survived by sister Lorraine and brother Myron. In 1970, Trevor and Kathleen founded Wellfleet Pottery, their artistic collaboration and livelihood, where they produced Wellfleet Pottery Umber China, now a collectable. Trevor was born and raised in Vancouver, Canada. He studied philosophy and architecture at the University of British Columbia and University of Manitoba. In the 1950s, Trevor and Kathleen helped found Israel's nascent ceramic industry. They subsequently lived in London, England where Trevor undertook doctoral work in philosophy of art and architecture at the University of London, which he later continued at Harvard University, and Kathleen studied at the London School of Drawing and Painting. During the early 1960s, Trevor and his family lived in New York, where he worked as a creative writer in advertising on Madison Avenue, and first began to develop designs for Wellfleet Pottery. During that time, he also received an award for his work on a documentary about the aviators the Wright Brothers. Although Trevor increasingly suffered from a debilitating motor disease, he continued to draw and write short stories until his final weeks. The family will hold a memorial gathering, open to all who wish to attend, at 5 pm on June 9 at 165 Commercial Street in Wellfleet.
