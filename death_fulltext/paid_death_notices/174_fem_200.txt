        ROTHENBERG-Lillian. Our much adored Lillian lost her heroic battle to ovarian cancer on July 23, 2001. Teacher, mentor, author and artist extraordinaire, ardently devoted to family and friends. Her passion for life inspired us. Her irresistable smile & wit enchanted us. Her indomitable spirit will live in our hearts forever. Chapel services at Parkside Memorial, Queens Boulevard and 66th Avenue, Forest Hills, New York, Wednesday, July 25 at noon.
        ROTHENBERG-Lillian. Passed away July 23, 2001. Dearest and closest friend, we will miss our wonderful Wednesdays together visiting museums, art galleries, theaters, music and dance performances. We will miss her sense of humor, her artistic talent, her generosity of spirit and her always being there to listen. Claire and Paul Finkel
