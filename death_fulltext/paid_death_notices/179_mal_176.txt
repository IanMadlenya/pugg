        SLATER-Michael Wylie, 58 years old, died suddenly from injuries suffered in an accident, on December 8, 2001. He is survived by his beloved wife of 34 years, Teri, his two adored sons, Eric and Edward, as well as his brother Jonathan Slater, numerous nieces, nephews and cousins. He attended the Lawrenceville School and Stanford University, and was the former President of Friends of the Earth Foundation. As an investor, as well as an environmentalist, he used his keen mind, his wit and his charm to remind us all of our humanity, and our obligation to ensure that what we have today, will be there for the next generation to enjoy tommorrow. We all deeply mourn his untimely loss. On Friday, December 14, 2001 a Mass will be held at St. Ignatius Loyola at 980 Park Avenue and 84th Street, with a reception to follow at the Explorers Club, located at 46 East 70th Street. In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to Friends of the Earth, 10025 Vermont Avenue, Washington, D.C. 20005.
