        MATT-William A. On July 8, 2000 at the age of 79. Beloved husband of Joan for 50 years, devoted father of Phil and wife Beth. Dear brother of Benjamin and of sister Teresa. Loving grandfather to Theo and Carolyn. Bill was the highly regarded proprietor, with his brother Benjamin, of D. Matt, Inc., master picture framers to major museums, designers, artist and collectors worldwide from their shop at 223 East 80th Street in New York. The business was begun by their father David Matt in 1920, and closed in 1989 when Bill and Ben retired. A largely selftaught cellist, Bill had an encyclopedic knowledge of classical music, and played with several amateur symphony orchestras on Long Island. His enthusiasm and wonderful, engaging personality made him a popular figure at the several private golf clubs in the New York area to which he belonged over the years. He obtained his baccalaureate degree from Brooklyn College, and his MFA from NYU. Bill will be missed by his family and many friends and business associates. Donations may be made to The Jewish Family Service of Rochester, NY.
