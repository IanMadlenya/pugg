        WEBB-J. Watson, Jr. It is with great sadness that the Board of Trustees of the Shelburne Museum notes the passing of J. Watson Webb Jr., past President and Chairman of the Board. A man of great energy and creativity, Mr. Webb dedicated 36 years to the Museum as a devoted steward of the legacy of his mother, Electra Havemeyer Webb, founder of the Shelburne Museum. A brilliant raconteur with a mischievous sense of humor, he will be missed by friends and colleagues. We are grateful for his leadership and his indomitable spirit. Philip von Stade, Chairman Hope Alswang, President
