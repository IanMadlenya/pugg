        PRESS--Joel. The All Stars Project is deeply saddened by the sudden passing of our board member Joel Press, who was an extraordinary friend and champion of poor and minority young people in New York City. Joel was a successful businessman who gave his heart and soul to help disadvantaged youth have better educations, opportunities, and lives. A longtime, generous supporter of the All Stars, Joel was passionately involved with the All Stars performing arts programs, and was known, loved and respected by the many inner - city young people whose lives he touched. We extend our deepest condolences to the Press family, to his dear friend David Feliciano, and to Joel's many, many friends in the All Stars family and beyond. As we mourn the passing of this wonderful human being, his legacy of caring and commitment to young people will live on at the All Stars Project. Gabrielle L. Kurlander, President Robert B. Levy, Chair, Board of Directors All Stars Project
