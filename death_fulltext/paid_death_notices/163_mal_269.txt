        LEWINSKY-Akiva. The Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany (Claims Conference) deeply mourns the passing in Israel of Akiva Lewinsky, our honorary treasurer. Our beloved friend Akiva served tirelessly on behalf of Shoah survivors as Claims Conference vice president and treasurer as well as chairman of our Negotiating and Allocations committees. Our heartfelt sympathy goes to his family. May Akiva's memory remain a blessing. Rabbi Israel Miller, president Gideon Taylor, executive vice president Saul Kagan, executive vice president emeritus
