        SPRAGUE - Robert Norman, peacefully at his home January 13. Retired from the field of aging and employment. He was a voracious reader. His humor, love and endless curiosity will be missed by his son, Wolcott E. Sprague (Eric), his friend and companion of many years, Hilary Knatz, and other family and friends with whom he loved to keep touch by phone. A gathering for rememberance will be held at his home in February.
        SPRAGUE-Robert Norman, We wish to express our sorrow and sympathy to Hilary Knatz and Eric Sprague. We too will miss Norman's gentle love, dry wit and wide knowlege. Rev. Humberto & Jill Porras David, John & Jenny Lamoreux Ada Luz & Yolanda Porras
