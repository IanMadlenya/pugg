        GRUBER-Sylvia, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla. It is with deep sorrow and regret we mourn the loss of our sisterin-law and aunt, Sylvia Gruber, on Friday, April 11, 2003. Sylvia's great courage and resilience in the face of her constant pain over many years was an inspiration to all who knew her. May she finally know the peace and freedom from pain that she so valiantly sought for so many years. Our condolences go out to Maurice, her husband for over 55 years; to her son, Philip, and his wife, Carole; to her daughter, Alice Glassman, her husband, Barry, and grandchildren, Adam and Kimberly Gruber. Fanny Levin, James P. and Emily Levin, and Gene A. Heller and their Families
