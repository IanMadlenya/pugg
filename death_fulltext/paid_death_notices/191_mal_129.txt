        GLUCK-Melvin C., M.D. The faculty, staff and students of New York University School of Medicine mourn the loss of our colleague, Dr. Melvin C. Gluck, Associate Professor of Medicine and a founder of the Nephrology Division. A graduate of the School of Medicine, an outstanding teacher and physician, and a friend to many, Dr. Gluck embodied the finest traditions of the medical profession. He will be missed by his colleagues, patients, and students. We extend our deepest sympathies to his family. Robert M. Glickman, M.D. Dean, NYU School of Medicine
