        YANG-Alice. In memory of Alice Yang, our beloved colleague and friend, who was one of the most engaging intellectuals involved with the arts today and, worked at The New Museum of Contemporary Art as Assistant Curator from 1988-1993. Her colleagues and friends admired and loved her brilliance, her thoughfulness and grace, her smile. We were privileged to know her and mourn the loss of this talented young woman who was so committed to life. As we gather today for her funeral, we extend our deepest sympathy to the Yang and Szeto families, for we will miss her always.
        YANG-Alice Huei-Zu. The staff and trustees of the Parrish Art Museum mourn the untimely passing of Alice Yang, Robert Lehman Curator and Curator of Collections and Exhibitions. Her time with us, although brief, will be remembered for her thoughtful ways, diligence, and good humor. She was collegial in the best sense, desiring to engage on many levels. We deeply regret we were unable to experience the promise of her achievements, and we send our sympathy to the Yang and Szeto families. Trudy C. Kramer, Director Mildred C. Brinn, Chairman
