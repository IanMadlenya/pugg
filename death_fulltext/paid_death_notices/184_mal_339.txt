        BUCHBERG-Abraham S., M.D. The faculty and staff of the Pulmonary Medicine Division at Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine mourn the loss on May 25 of Abraham Buchberg, Professor, accomplished physician, and former Division Director. During his halfcentury of service to Montefiore, which saw the development of Pulmonary Medicine as a specialty, Abe shared his gifts of teaching and caring for patients with countless medical students, residents, fellows, and attending physicians. His gentle wit, courteous demeanor, clinical acumen, and deep wisdom inspired all of us. Our heartfelt sympathies go to his wife, Vera, his children, Karl and Lisa, his grandchildren, Emma & Nora, and his sister, Irene.
