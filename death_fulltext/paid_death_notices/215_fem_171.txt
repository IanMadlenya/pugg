        ROSENBERG -- Joan M. Peacefully, after a long illness, on December 23, 2004 at 80. Beloved wife of Fred L. Rosenberg, daughter of the late Sidney and Jessie Mattison, loving mother of son Eric and daughter Vicki and of Eric's wife Helen, devoted grandmother of Karen and Stuart, loving sister of Willa Bernhard. Joan was a joyful and creative woman. Gentle and kind, she nevertheless had a firm sense of self. Her physical beauty never obscured the beauty within, spiritual and intellectual and apparent to all who knew her. A fine and accomplished painter and sculptor, she had many shows, group and solo; won numerous awards; and is represented in many private collections. She was a longtime member of the Art Students League of New York, on whose board she served for several years, and the National Arts Club. Memorial service Monday, December 27, 2004, at 11:00AM at Temple Emanu-El, Fifth Ave. at 65th St. Contributions in her memory may be made to ''The Art Students League of New York,'' 215 West 57th St., NY, NY 10019, attention: Joan M. Rosenberg Memorial Scholarship Fund.
