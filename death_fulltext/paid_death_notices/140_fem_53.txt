        SCHURGIN-Audrey. We mourn the loss of our unforgettable colleague, Audrey-our mentor, booster and friend with her welcoming smiles, enveloping hugs and upbeat vibrance. She spurred us to do only our best. Audrey's conviction that each child is a gem to be polished will forever guide us. We extend heartfelt sympathies to her family and thank them for letting us, too, bask in her warm special glow. The Teachers and Staff of SAR Academy
