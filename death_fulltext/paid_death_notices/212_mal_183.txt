        GOLDSTEIN--David. David Goldstein was a consummate jurist whose love of the law was surpassed only by his dedication to his family and friends. The terrible disease which tortured his body for years never succeeded in dulling his extraordinary mind nor lessening his incredible will to live. We hope that his soul finally may find rest, but expect that he already is applying for a judgeship in the hereafter. We offer our love and condolences to his loving and dedicated wife Liz, his adoring daughters Deborah and Robin, and his extraordinary mother Irma. David Rosenberg Bernice Leber
        GOLDSTEIN--Judge David. An excellent lawyer and jurist. He showed great courage and dignity. Our love to Liz and the girls. Barbara and Bentley Kassal
