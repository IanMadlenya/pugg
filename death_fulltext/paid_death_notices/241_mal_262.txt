        SCHAECHTER--Mordkhe. We join the world of Yiddish scholarship in mourning the death of our dear friend, the legendary Dr. Mordkhe Schaechter. A giant in the field, his intellect, passion, leadership, and humanity will be sorely missed by all who treasure Mame-Loshn. Our deepest sympathy to Charne, and his beloved children and grandchildren. Mary-Lynne and Thomas E. Bird
