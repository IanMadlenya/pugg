        EPSTEIN-Jacob. 94, at home. Jake left us March 10, to join Ruth, his beloved wife, companion, and comrade. Nieces, nephews, and countless friends will miss him always. A lifelong social activist, Jake went to Spain with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. He was a translator, talented designer, lover of the arts, and loyal friend. To the end, Jake remained himselfsharp and smart, talking politics and quoting Shakespeare. Goodbye Jake, we love you.
