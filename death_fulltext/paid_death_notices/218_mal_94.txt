        SHUDOFSKY -- Noam. The Officers, Board of Directors, Staff and Students at the Columbia/Barnard Hillel mourns the loss of Dr. Noam Shudofsky, father of Leora Shudofsky, our extraordinary Associate Director. As a leader in Jewish Education, Dr. Shudofsky has been supportive of our efforts in countless ways for years. Above all, he provided a role model of Jewish communal service for his daughter, who has shared those skills and devotion with us at the Kraft Center. Simon Klarfeld, Exec Dir Earle W.
