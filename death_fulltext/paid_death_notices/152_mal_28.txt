        AVICK-Jeffrey Jay. On September 1, 1999. Beloved friend of Seth Glassman, treasured son of Ben & Miriam Avick, and dear brother to Kenneth and Patti Mactas. Jeff will be sorely missed by all whose lives he touched whether through his work on the stage, his lovely writing, the abundance of his gardens, or his kindness, generosity, and friendship. A man of great beauty and no vanity is gone from us. Jeff, may ''flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.'' Contributions in his memory may be sent to The Connecticut Hospice, 61 Burban Dr., Branford, CT 06405.
