        FRIEDMAN--Lee. Born April 19, 1942, his life unpublicized on purpose was the king of make it happen. In a career that launched the era of celebrity marketing in fashion and rock and roll, his inner circle was a mega database of who's who of the famous, the notsofamous and the unbelievably talented. Lee's heart beat to the tune of everything and everyone in his everything. His candid version of obvious, hip and what mattered trademarked his light up your life persona. A self-made, exquisitely honed success story and daddy of two baby girls at twenty something, his life as business mogul, father, grandfather, son, brother and best friend steered its course through his own brand of spirituality. Eternally optimistic, he owned the glass is half full mantra. Always in the moment, at 61 he understood young. A philanthropist, dedicated to New York City, the city he loved with a passion, well read and traveled and an avid foodie, Lee will be incredibly missed--the world a bit lonelier place until perhaps the next generation is lucky enough to produce another Lee. Lee Friedman passed away on December 26, 2003 from cancer. The son of Jean Friedman and the late Alfred Friedman he is survived by his daughters, Tiffany Friedman, Jessica Brown and sonin-law Erio Brown, his grandchildren, Stella Brown and Dillon Brown, his sister Abby Kinsley Davison and brotherin-law, Richard Davison. Please send your love to Lee and his family with donations to Friends In Deed, 594 Broadway, New York 10012. A memorial service will be held at a later date.
