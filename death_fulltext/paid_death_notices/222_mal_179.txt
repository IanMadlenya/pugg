        RUTMAN--Craig. The students, faculty, and staff of Monroe College have lost a very special person, a true leader and teacher who everyone admired. As Chair of the Culinary Arts Program, he loved what he did, most of all working with and seeing the success of his students. He will be missed by all of us. Our deepest sympathies to his widow, Cindy, and daughter, Brooke. Stephen J. Jerome, President, Monroe College
