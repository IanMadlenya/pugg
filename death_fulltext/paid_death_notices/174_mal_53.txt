        RUBINSTEIN-Benjamin, Dr. Died peaceably and courageously on July 2. He was a devoted and loving husband of Irene for over 65 years. He adored his sister Shirley, and an inordinately proud father of Larry, Peter and John. Loved by his daughters-in-law Robin, Kerry and Blair. He saw his future in his grandchildren Mara and Jeff Tanzman, Eve, Michael, Noah, James, Jill and Adam Rubinstein. He relished being a great grandfather to little Noah. Of strong constitution and opinions, he served as a caring dentist to generations of patients and maintained loyalty to the Educational Alliance and Surprise Lake Camp for their support of his growth and development in his youth. As a proud and loving Jew, he supported the state of Israel from its birth and always cared about the well being of synagogues. His memory will be a blessing.
