        ZIMMERMAN-Muriel. The Institute for Psychoanalytic Training and Research (IPTAR) mourns the loss of our esteemed colleague and friend, Dr. Muriel Zimmerman. Muriel made many contributions to the IPTAR community during her career. She served on our faculty, and was a training analyst and supervisor. From 1982-84 she held the office of President. Earlier in her career Muriel was on the faculty of Brooklyn College and, more recently, an adjunct professor at Cornell Medical School until her retirement. Our heartfelt condolences to her husband, Stanley Rosenman; her daughter, Joyce Slochower; her son, Peter Rosenman, and her four grandchildren
