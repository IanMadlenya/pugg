        ALPERT--Warren. The Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University records with deep sorrow the passing of Warren Alpert, a former member of our Board of Overseers. Mr. Alpert demonstrated his philanthropic vision and commitment to medical education at Einstein by establishing an endowed scholarship that has benefited many of our students over the years, and will continue to do so in the future. His generosity also extended to biomedical research programs at Einstein, and to Yeshiva University. To his beloved family, we offer our heartfelt sympathies. Yeshiva University Richard M.
