        BRENT--Liane Beebe, beloved wife of Lt. Col. W.I. Christopher Brent for these past 27 years, died peacefully at home surrounded by her loving family in New York City on March 8, 2007. Formerly, Liane was married to Frederick S. (''Fritz'') Beebe, who died in 1973 after serving as Chairman of the Board of the Washington Post Company through a tumultuous decade with Liane at his side. Her life began in Munich, Germany in 1916. After her education at the Poggio Imperiale School in Florence, Italy, she came to America in 1938 where, with Fritz, she raised their two sons, Walter and Michael, who, with their loving spouses Carol McDaniel Beebe and Nancy Beebe, will miss her tremendously. While her pan-European roots remained vital, her wide-ranging generosity inspired and supported her friends and family and New York culture. Now she leaves them and her close, caring grandchildren John, Kathryn, Andrew, Alison, Christine, Frederick and Galen, her adoring great-grandchildren Emily, Liana, Anna, Madeleine, Nicholas, Jackson, Luca, Matteo and Kallean. The deft touch of her personal poems and keen written observations filled those fortunate enough to receive them with delight. Noni (her family nickname) deserves a standing ovation for a life of oneto-one love with each individual in the worlds she embraced. Visiting hours from 4 to 7 pm, Sunday March 11, at the Frank Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street, New York, NY. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that generous gifts be made in her name to your favorite charity. Service at 11 am, Monday, March 12, at the Holy Trinity Church, 319 East 74 Street.
