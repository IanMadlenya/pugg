        ROBIN-Richard. Son of the late Henri Rabinowicz and Sophie Romanus Rabinowicz, died peacefully on June 12, 2001 at 88 years of age. His stories of pre-WWII Europe, then fighting the Germans as a French Cavalry Officer or working, after the fall of France, on behalf of displaced persons and Jewish refugees as Director of the ''Camp des Milles'' (JDC/HIAS) outside Marseille, and being among the last to escape Free France before it fell to German occupation, never ceased to amaze his friends and family. He became a USA citizen in the Army and used his linguistic talents working for the Office of War Information Agency, continuing his career in the Air Force and Army. Loving and devoted husband of Therese for 58 years, beloved father to Jacky and Jeffrey, doting and proud grandfather of Scott and Mark. His story telling, wit and charm will be missed. Visitation Thursday, June 14th 7-9PM and Services Friday, June 15th 11:30AM at ''The Riverside,'' 76th St. and Amsterdam Ave. Shiva will be observed at the Clyman residence on Saturday, June 16th from 8PM-10PM and Sunday 5PM9PM. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to a favorite charity.
