        CONLEY-John, M.D. Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons mourns the passing of John Conley, Professor Emeritus of Clinical Otolaryngology. An esteemed colleague and teacher, he served Columbia Presbyterian for more than 20 years. Dr. Conley was recognized throughout the world as an outstanding leader, teacher, and scholar devoted to the field of head and neck surgery. He had a profound influence on generations of medical students and colleagues. His many outstanding contributions to medical eduation, research, and practice will remain as a legacy for future generations of otolaryngologists. A long-time friend and colleague whose many contributions enriched the Department of Otolaryngology, he will be greatly missed and his memory cherished. We extend our deepest sympathy to Dr. Conley's family. Herbert Pardes, M.D. Vice President for Health Sciences Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons
