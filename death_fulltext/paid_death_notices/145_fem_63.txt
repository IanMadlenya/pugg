        FOGLIA-Joan. In the last days of her 35 year life shortened by smoking, Joan Foglia courageously dedicated herself to preventing similar smoking tragedies in young girls and women. By lectures, TV appearances and news articles, she told of her impending death from lung cancer and how she wished she could ''turn the clock back'' to when she was 15 and started smoking. She also recorded her feelings on a tape which will be distributed to those with similar dedication to preventing death from smoking. Although Joan died, her example will inspire many young girls and women to quit a life-shortening addiction. William G. Cahan, M.D.
