        VAN LENTEN-Barry (Bernard F. Jr.). Your friendship graced by life for more than twenty five years, be it in New York, the Pines, faroff Abidjan. Your wit, fierce intelligence made your writings a treasured gift. Your courage and strength of spirit have been inspirational. ''Who is to say, old friends, How an old friendship survives? One day chums Having a laugh a minute, One day comes And they're a part of your lives.'' Peace be with you, old friend. Lady Cynthia
        VAN LENTEN-Bernard F. Jr. (Barry). Age 56. Associate Publisher, Editor At Large, and columnist of DNR, died on August 15, 1998 at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan, following an illness. Born in Paterson, NJ, he had lived in HoHo-Kus and Ridgewood, before moving to Manhattan in 1963. For more than 30 years, Barry was a life-force and a brilliant, discerning critic of the menswear industry in the U.S. and abroad. His wit, his passion, and his intelligent commentary informed the public for whom he wrote. Barry's business accomplishments were exceeded only by his service to society and to humanity. He was one of the first to see the devastating effect HIV/AIDS would have on the fashion community and spearheaded the first AMFAR fund raiser in April 1986 (Aids Strikes Without Prejudice), sponsored by the fashion, fragrance and cosmetic industries. Barry was an exemplary teacher, a mentor to so many, a devoted and loving brother, a great friend, and a consummate gardener. His good works shall live on long after him. Barry is survived by a sister, Patricia Ann Van Lenten, of North Branch, NJ, a brother, Brian J. Van Lenten, of Sherman Oaks, CA, a brother-inlaw, and a nephew, Ruben E. Abigador, and David Bernard Abigador, also of North Branch, NJ. A celebration of Barry's life will be announced at a later date.
