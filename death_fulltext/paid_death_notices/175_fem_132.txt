        SAKRAIDA-Mary Jo Hughes. It is with tremendous sadness that we mourn the untimely loss of Mary Jo Hughes Sakraida, who passed away on Wednesday, August 15, 2001. Mary was a powerful force for good in the communities of Northern Westchester. As president of the Junior League of Northern Westchester and a member of the Auxiliary of the Northern Westchester Hospital Center, Mary nurtured the towns of Northern Westchester by leading many projects to benefit the community. Mary was also a wonderful friend, mentor, advisor, and guide to the many lives she touched. She combined incredible graciousness with a wicked sense of fun. Mary always sent flowers, gifts, and personal notes to friends and acquaintances to celebrate successes and console in times of trouble. She brought a wealth of positive energy to the many good works in which she was engaged. Mary was also the life of every party and the first one to erupt into laughter at the sublime or the ridiculous. Mary Jo was the beloved wife of Michael Sakraida, daughter of the late Robert J. and Mary B. (Sullivan) Hughes, sister of Robert Hughes (Meg, Orchard Park, NY), Daniel Hughes (LeAnn, Lancaster, NY), and Jennifer McMullen (William, Mt. Lebanon, PA), sister-in-law to Joseph Sakraida (Sheila), Vincent Sakraida (Teresa), and Kathleen Sakraida, daughter-in-law to Audrey Sakraida, and adoring aunt. Mary was born and raised in Buffalo, NY. She was graduated from Fordham University. The Junior League of Northern Westchester has renamed its scholarship program for graduating high school seniors engaged in community service the Mary Sakraida Scholarship Fund. Contributions to the Mary Sakraida Scholarship Fund may be made to: JLNW, 344 Main Street, Mt. Kisco, NY 10549. Viewing will be held at Clark Associates Funeral Home, Katonah. Viewing times 2-4PM and 7-9PM on Saturday, August 18 and Sunday August 19. A Mass and funeral service will be held at St. Patrick's Church in Bedford at 10 AM on August 20.
