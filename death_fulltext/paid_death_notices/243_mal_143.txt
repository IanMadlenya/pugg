        VONNEGUT--Kurt. The Principals and staff of Wohl, Fried, Roth & Kirchenberg, C.P.A.'s extend our deepest sympathy to the family of Kurt Vonnegut. We were privileged not only to represent him, but to know him as a friend. He was a legend and will be sorely missed by all who came to appreciate his talent and wit, whether by reading his works or by knowing him through the twinkle in his eyes.
