        LEVY--James A., M.D. Loving husband to Susan, father to Jenni and Joseph, and grandfather to Emma Smith; devoted father-in-law to David Smith and Susanne Rehnstrom. Remembered by his patients for his kindness and generosity, and by all who knew him for his strength and dignity. He was born June 27th, 1933 in New Rochelle, New York. After graduating from Princeton Summa Cum Laude in 1954, Jim married Susan Schwartz on his 21st birthday. He attended medical school at New York University and completed his residency and cardiology fellowship at Bellevue Hospital. In 1961, a year after the birth of his daughter, Jenni, he joined his father-in-law, Dr. Nathaniel H. Schwartz, in medical practice in Port Chester, New York. His son Joseph was born in 1964. He was Chief of Cardiology at United Hospital in Port Chester for more than a decade and Director of Non-invasive Cardiology at Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla where he had been working since 1957, when it was known as Grasslands. He taught at New York Medical College, for over 30 years, until the time of his death. Dr. Levy was a former board member of the American Heart Association and past President of the Westchester/Putnam and New York state chapters of the organization. He loved California Petit Sirah, the novels of John O'Hara, the music of Berlioz and above all, his wife and children. He was tireless in his care of his patients and unique in his devotion to the ideals of medicine. He will be missed.
