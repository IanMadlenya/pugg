        COLESBERRY -- Robert. NYU's Tisch School of the Arts notes with deep sorrow the passing of our friend and alumnus Robert Colesberry. After graduating from the School's film program in 1973, he went on to distinguish himself as a consummate storyteller and an award-winning producer, earning Peabody and Emmy Awards as well as Oscar and Golden Globe nominations. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife Karen L. Thorson and the entire family.
