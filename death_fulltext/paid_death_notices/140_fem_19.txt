        DEPLEDGE-Jane E. It is with great sorrow that the partners, counsel, associates and staff of LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae L.L.P., mourn the untimely passing of our friend and colleague Jane E. Depledge, who along with her mother, father and brother did not survive the crash of Swissair Flight 111. Jane, an alumnus of Yale University, started with LeBoeuf as a summer associate in 1995, and joined the Firm in 1996 following her graduation from Columbia University School of Law, becoming an associate in our trusts & estates practice. We honor Jane's memory, the memories of her parents and brother and those of all who passed in this tragedy.
