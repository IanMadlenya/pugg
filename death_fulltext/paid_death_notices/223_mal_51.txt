        HIGGINS--William W. The Board of Directors mourns the passing of fellow Board member, William W. Higgens. Bill was an accomplished man of generous spirit and wry humor. He has been a longtime friend of CR &T and was never reluctant to show his support for research into the causes and treatment of cancer. Professionally, he was at home in the corporate boardroom and willingly gave his quiet insight and studied opinion. He leaves behind many grateful friends who are richer for having known him. We grieve with his wife Judy and his family. Cancer Research & Treatment Fund
