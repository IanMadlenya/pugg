        WILSON-William. The Bard College community deeply mourns the passing of William Wilson '48, a beloved teacher of literature and the humanities for four decades at Bard. He was a dear friend of the college and, above all, an inspiring teacher and advisor. Generations of Bard students are indebted to his guidance and to his enthusiasm and sharp insight. As a colleague, friend, neighbor and alumnus, his life and work were deeply woven into the fabric of the college. He will be sorely missed. We extend our deepest condolences to his entire family. Leon Botstein, President David E. Schwab II, Chairman
