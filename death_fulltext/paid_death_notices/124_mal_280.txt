        DELSON-Robert. An international lawyer who devoted his life to the betterment of his fellow man, first as theoretician of the American Socialist Party, with Norman Thomas in the 1930's, later in his work with Americans for Democratic Action, The International League for the Rights of Man, The N.A.A.C.P., The American Civil Liberties Union and S.A.N.E. His major focus after World War II was that of helping bring independence and world recognition to such emerging nations as Indonesia, India, Burma, Ghana, Senegal, Guyana and others. In the latter part of his life, he worked ceaselessly for unilateral nuclear disarmament. A loving husband, father and grandfather, Mr. Delson died peacefully at his home late Thursday, after a long illness. He is survived by his sons, Eric and James and their wives, Roberta and Jennifer, as well as his grandchildren, William, Caroline and Robert. Arrangements will be private.
