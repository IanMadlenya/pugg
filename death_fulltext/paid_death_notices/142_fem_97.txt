        SUCHERMAN-Bertha. The Sucherman family deeply mourns the passing of Bertha Sucherman, who was a light and an inspiration to her sons, Lowell & Stuart; her grandchildren, Greg, Matthew, Joanna and David; and her daughters-in-law, Janice, Betsy and Tracy. Her indomitable will, directness, honesty and unlimited abundance of good cheer and optimism will remain with us for years to come. Funeral services will be held on Thursday, November 11th at 11:00 am at Riverside Memorial Chapel (180 W. 76th Street at Amsterdam Avenue). In lieu of flowers, the family has asked that donations be made to Hadassah Chaverot in Far Rockaway (donations may be mailed to 206 Seagirt Boulevard, Lawrence, NY 11559).
