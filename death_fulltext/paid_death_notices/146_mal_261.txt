        DICKEY-Joseph Michael. We are deeply saddened and shocked by the tragic loss of our special, dearly beloved friend and associate, Joe Dickey, on March 8, 1999. He was employed at the MTA NYC Transit Headquarters in the capacity of Senior Director, Medical Information Management Services. He was our guide and mentor for many years. We will sorely miss him, his advice and counsel. May the family be comforted knowing that he was a gentleman of innovation and integrity. We have lost a rare and kind person and will be the poorer for this loss, although we will always be the richer for having known him. We express our deepest regrets to his family. A memorial service to celebrate the life of Joe Dickey, distinguished friend and colleague, will be held on Monday, March 15, 6:00 PM, at the Riverside Church, 490 Riverside Drive, New York, New York 10027. Phone 212-870-6700. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made to the Riverside Church's Ministry for Education and Social Justice.
