        BRISKIE-Julius. The directors, officers and employees of Pace Press, Inc. deeply regret the passing of our beloved President, Julius Briskie. He touched the hearts of all of us with his kindness and innate fairness. His strength of character commanded the respect that we all hold for our beloved Julie. His examples of hard work, integrity and foresight will remain with us, for they are indelibly etched in our hearts and minds. He will be sorely missed, but he leaves us with a heritage that we can never forget. Our deepest sympathy to his beloved wife Bess, his devoted children Jane and Robert Sylvester, his grandson Jonas and his sister Celia Epstein.
