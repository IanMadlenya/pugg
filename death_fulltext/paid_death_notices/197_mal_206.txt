        FREEDMAN--Ellis. The directors and officers of the Aaron Copland Fund for Music, Inc. and the Virgil Thomson Foundation, Ltd. express their sorrow at the loss of one of our founding directors, Ellis Freedman. Ellis' foresight and wise counsel led to the formation of our organizations, and enabled them to continue their strong support of American music and its creators. His gentle humor and his generous spirit will be very much missed, but his devotion to American music and composers will live on in our work. Our sympathies are with his children and grandchildren. The Aaron Copland Fund for Music, Inc. John Harbison, President The Virgil Thomson Foundation, Ltd. Richard Flender, President >>AD#
