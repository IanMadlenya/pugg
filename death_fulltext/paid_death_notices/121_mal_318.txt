        SIMON-Merrill. Bar-Ilan University in Israel and its American Friends mourn the untimely passing of our generous patron and Presidential Founder, Merrill Simon. He published many volumes through which he was helpful to the business world. His greatest achievement was, however, that he discovered his roots in his middle years and he applied himself to the Jewish heritage with such zeal and commitment that he commanded the respect of all who knew him. To his loving family, we extend sincerest condolences and with them we share many inspiring memories. Rabbi Emanuel Rackman, Chancellor, Bar-Ilan University Jane Stern Lebell, President, American Friends Brig. Gen. (Res) Yehuda Halevy, Executive Vice President, Bar-Ilan University
