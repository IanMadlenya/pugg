        SIEGEL--Max W., 94, on April 24, 2007. A humble but passionate man, who aspired to make the world a better place and inspired others to do the same. He worked hard for good candidates and good causes, most recently the Working Families Party. Max grew up in Brownsville. In the 1930's he became a union organizer. After serving in WWII, Max moved the family to Long Beach, L.I. where he was active in reform politics. He and his wife, Sara, ''retired'' to Costa Rica, then Florida, moving back to NYC to live at Carnegie East House in Manhattan. Max leaves behind Sara, his beloved wife of 71 years, twins Mark (of Peterborough, Ontario) and Dorothy (of Brooklyn, NY), and grandchildren, Elizabeth Abram, Samuel Abram, and Joel Siegel.
