        SCHORR-Israel, Rabbi. His life and actions embodied the best of Torah scholarship. His enormous knowledge of culture, art and science matched his breathtaking erudition in Jewish law and lore. His personal dignity, respect for all people and unabashed love of the land and people of Israel all combined to create an inspiring teacher and communicator. With affection we salute his leadership of the former Yeshiva Etz Chaim of Boro Park and its successor foundation. May his entire family of relatives and thousands of students be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Hon. Jerome Hornblass, Pres. Yeshiva Etz Chaim Found.
