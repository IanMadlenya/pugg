        TURINGAN-Jean, M.D. It is with profound sorrow and a deep sense of regret that we, the Board of Trustees, the Medical Staff and the entire Bronx Lebanon Hospital Center family mourn the passing of Dr. Jean Turingan, Deputy Director for Quality Assurance and Residency Training and an attending physician in our Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Dr. Turingan was also Clinical Assistant Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. She was a compassionate, caring and dedicated physician at Bronx Lebanon for more than twenty years. Her sudden passing is certainly a great loss to us. We extend our sincere condolences to her family. Miguel Martinez, Chairman, Board of Trustees Miguel A. Fuentes, Jr., President and Chief Exec Officer Milton Gumbs, MD, Vice President, Medical Affairs/Medical Director
