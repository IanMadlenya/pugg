        WEINER--Lewis. The Society for the History of Czechoslovak Jewry, Inc. mourns the death of its distinguished past president on September 15th, 2003 at the age of 93. The Society was founded by Dr. Kurt Wehle in 1961 to publish accurate historical essays describing Jewish participation in every aspect of Czechoslovak life between the two World Wars, thus counteracting the distorting revisionism of the Czech Communist regime. Lewis Weiner followed Kurt Wehle, Hugh Colman, and Ludovic Sturc as President of the Society. He brought his vast energies, broad vision and total dedication to the Society in the 1980s and early 1990s, supervising the publication in 1984 of the most challenging volume in the Society's trilogy, ''The Jews of Czechoslovakia,'' dealing with the Holocaust, as well as six annual reviews in the subsequent years, ably assisted by Gertrude Hirschler. Lewis Weiner's leadership was characterized by gentlemanly grace, dignity, a generous spirit and dry wit. He was a true heir of Tomas Masaryk's legacy and a worthy son of the Jewish people; his contributions a substantial tribute to the rich, complex and tragic story of Czechoslovak Jews. We extend condolences to his family: Joyce, Lynn, Ted, Susan, former wife Anita, and first cousin, Society member Hannah Gruna. May God console the family among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Rabbi Norman R. Patz, Pres. Prof. Dr. Fred Hahn, VP Dr. Amira Kohn-Trattner, VP
