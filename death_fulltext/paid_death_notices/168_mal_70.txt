        GLICKMAN-Marty. The Officers and Directors of the PSAL Wingate Memorial Fund are deeply saddened by the death of our fellow Director and longtime friend, Marty Glickman. Marty was a great athlete at James Madison High School where he excelled in track and football. He was an outstanding athlete at Syracuse University, a member of the 1936 U.S. Olympic Team and a sports broadcaster without peer. With all his success he never forgot the PSAL and, until his death, remained a faithful supporter. In short, he was a great guy and reflects the best of what the PSAL is all about. We are all going to miss him.
