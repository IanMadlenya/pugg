        BAUMAN--Sidney. March 25, 1914-April 21, 2004. Grew up alone to master the ways of NY and win the woman of his dreams. The wounded W.W. II Vet returned to raise his children and worship his wife in a blazing romance that burns still. From the race tracks to the night clubs he was ''Bub'' to his wife ''Red'' as they embodied the city's style and glamour of their time. Proud, knowing and always gracious, he was the host wherever he went. Worldly wise and tough, except when leading the band in ''You're Nobody 'Til Somebody Loves You.'' He is survived by his infatuated wife Florence, children Steven and Fern, grandchildren Beau, Spencer, Sean and Ben. We love you more. Services Monday, April 26, 11:00 AM. Lang Tobia Dipalma Funeral Home, 406 Deerpark Ave, Babylon, NY 11702. 631-669-4040.
