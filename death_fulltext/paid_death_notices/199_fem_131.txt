        KALSMAN -- Lee. Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion records with profound sorrow the death of Lee Kalsman, a beloved friend and generous benefactor of the College. She and her late husband, Irving, dedicated their lives to the singular issue of Judaism and healing. First, they initiated a scholarship fund to foster chaplaincy training; subsequently, they sponsored a major conference; and ultimately, they endowed the Lee and Irving Kalsman Institute on Judaism and Health. Through this Institute, the College serves as a national think tank for those of all faiths committed to the mission of healing. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Peachy and Mark Levy and to their family whose loss we share. May the family find comfort together with all those who mourn for Zion and Jerusalem. Rabbi David Ellenson, President, HUC-JIR Burton Lehman, Chair of the Board, HUC-JIR
