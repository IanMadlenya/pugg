        WEIN--Joyce. A better friend could not be found. No greater love than between her and George. I am now bereft of 45 years of wise counsel, delightful company and grand travel companion. I flew up from D.C. to spend a last golden day with her, George and Bearle at home. George even catered lunch. An unforgettable experience! Love, Mary Nicholas Washington
