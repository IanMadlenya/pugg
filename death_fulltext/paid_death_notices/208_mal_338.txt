        SHAPIRO -- Salem Seeley. Age 95, died at his home in Redding, CT Thursday night. Born in 1909 in Fort George, or, as he liked to put it, ''in a farmhouse on Manhattan Island,'' he lived to see a world of wonders from radio to the Internet, and reveled in every minute of it. An NYU graduate, a talented city planner and World War II veteran (a corporal), he moved to Connecticut in 1949 where he was Director of City Planning in Norwalk, and Director of Urban Renewal in Stamford. He was a loving husband for 56 years to Edith, who died in 1997. He is mourned by his daughter Amy Shapiro of Weston, CT; his son Walter of New York; his daughter-inlaw Meryl Gordon of New York; and his sister Myrtle Vinson of Albuquerque, NM. The funeral will be held on Sunday at 11:00 AM at Sharon Gardens/Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, NY. The family will be receiving condolences Monday evening 6-9 pm, 8 Bridge Rd. in Weston, CT.
