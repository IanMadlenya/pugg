        DESROSIERS - Denise. Of West 76 Street, passed away on January 29. An extraordinary artist, Denise was an avid equestrian and lover of animals, but she'll be remembered most for her inexhaustible spirit and for being the most loyal, dependable and loving of sister, aunt and friend. We will miss her.
