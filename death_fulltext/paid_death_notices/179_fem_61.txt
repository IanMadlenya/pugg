        PATSURIS-Katherine, 66. Beloved wife and best friend of husband Theodore and loving mother of Penelope, succumbed to cancer on November 20. Kate was a passionate lifelong crusader for women's reproductive rights, working for Planned Parenthood for over three decades. She was a devoted wife and proud mother whose sharp wit and wonderful sense of the absurd will be sorely missed. The grace and courage with which she faced her illness continue to inspire us all. Mommy, wherever you are, you're always with us. Life is a banquet and you taught us to enjoy it on our own terms. Donations in her name can be made to the scholarship fund ''Young Voices for Choice,'' which was established in her honor. Planned Parenthood of Palm Beach and the Treasure Coast Area, 5312 Broadway, West Palm Beach, Florida 33407.
