        ETRA-Shirley. Song of Mama. We hold this image: you are sitting, elegantly dressed, not extravagant, graciously hosting. Upright, wry smile, inscrutable gaze. Proud, independent Boston Lady of no nonsense, no complaint, no regret, no words minced, great forbearance. Humble matriarch, holding still, holding firm, holding together, offering yourself to nourish others-the family glue, our protection. A brave, wise, stubborn, clear, sharp, soft, tough, tender, fierce, fiesty, feminine, force to be celebrated. We hold this image of your quiet dignity and beauty. Thank you for not stopping us, not giving up on us, letting us dream, letting us fail, letting us go. For selfless generosity never withheld. For being so strong, for caring for us in ways we are only beginning to understand. We will never forget you. Shirley Ruth Etra, award-winning grandmother of Max, Alexander, Diana and Daniel; beloved mother of her children and sons-in-laws, Julie Etra and Larry Turk, John Etra, and Gina and Kermit Stick; widow of Max J. Etra, her ''life's passion''; loving companion of Sidney Berman, and devoted friend to Danny, Paul, Stephanie, Jackie and Tony; died early Wednesday morning, October 6, 1999, peacefully in her home surrounded by loved ones.
