        STEIN-Celia. Founder, with her husband David, of The Riverdale Press, and the newspaper's guiding spirit from 1950 to the present, died on January 11, at her home in Riverdale. Her efforts helped win new schools and protect a special neighborhood. In turn, she was honored by virtually every community organization in Riverdale. The only thing she loved more than her community was her family, her sons Bernard and Richard; her daughters-in-law Marguerite Adams and Hilary Baum; her grandchildren Anna Stein, Alex Baum-Stein and Annie Baum-Stein and her husband Mauro; and her great-granddaughter Anaia Daigle. Services on Wednesday, January 15, at 1:30 PM, at Riverdale Temple, 246th St and Independence Ave. Contributions may be made to Riverdale Mental Health Association, 5676 Riverdale Ave; or Riverdale Neighborhood House, 5521 Mosholu Ave, Bronx, NY 10471.
