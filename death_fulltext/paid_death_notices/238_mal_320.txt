        $(6$)WEINBERG--Nathan. Officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn with profound sadness the loss of Nathan Weinberg, a cherished leader and friend. Nathan worked very closely with his family in conceiving the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation, one of the most remarkable and generous foundations in the world. He helped make it a reality, serving as a founding trustee. After the deaths of his brothers Harry and William, he continued to help guide that vision of devotion to care for the less fortunate, to assist the poor and vulnerable, the elderly, and the infirm. This treasured family legacy of caring for the Jewish community and the larger community has been passed on to his children, whose generosity and compassion continue to make a valuable impact in New York, throughout the United States, and around the world. The family's strong commitment, generosity, and steadfast support of UJA-Federation has strengthened our ability to serve those in need, making an enduring impact on the Jewish community, all New Yorkers, and millions of people in Israel, in the former Soviet Union, and throughout the world. We will miss Nathan greatly, and we extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Lillian (nee: Shapiro); his children: Donn and Sharon; Glenn and Debbi; and Joseph and Debra; his brother, David; & the entire Weinberg family. Morris W. Offit, President Susan K. Stern, Chair of the Board John S. Ruskay, Exec. V.P. & C.E.O.
