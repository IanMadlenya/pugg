        UPPMAN--Theodor. The Metropolitan Opera profoundly mourns the death of a dear friend and cherished artist, baritone Theodor Uppman, whose Met career spanned a quarter century and nearly 400 performances. He made his debut as Pelleas, was the Met's first and only Paquillo in ''La Perichole'' and holds the company record for performances of Papageno in ''Die Zauberfloete,'' Masetto in ''Don Giovanni,'' and Harlekin in ''Ariadne auf Naxos.'' Ted remained a frequent and welcome visitor to the house in recent years, and his warm and gracious presence will be greatly missed. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Jean, and all his family. Joseph Volpe, General Manager James Levine, Music Director
