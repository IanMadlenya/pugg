        BARTLETT-Elsa. The Department of Psychiatry at New York University Medical Center mourns the passing of our esteemed colleague, Dr. Elsa Bartlett, a valued and respected research scientist. For 15 years she made major contributions in the imaging of the action of antipsychotic drugs in the living human brain. Her devotion to quality research was marked by scientific rigor and integrity. Those who worked closest with her will miss her spirit, her work ethic, her kindness, and her loyalty. Our deepest sympathy is extended to her son Noah and all of her family. Robert Cancro, MD, Lucius N. Littauer Professor and Chairman Jonathan Brodie, MD, Ph.D., Professor of Psychiatry Dept. of Psychiatry
