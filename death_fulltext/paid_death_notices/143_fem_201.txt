        ABRAHAM-Stella Kronovet. Dr. and Mrs. Abraham welcomed us at Havdalah in Long Beach fifty years ago. Our family grew up with Danny, Judy, Jerry and Roy z'l, rejoiced with them and shared their sorrow. A visit to her in Toronto was a special experience. May they, their wonderful spouses, grandchildren and their families find consolation in Jerusalem. Els Bendheim and Family
