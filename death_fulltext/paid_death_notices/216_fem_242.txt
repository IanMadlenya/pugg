        CUNNIFF--Carley. With the passing of Carley Cunniff, Swarthmore College has lost a distinguished graduate, a treasured member of its Board of Managers, and a dear friend. Carley's brilliant acuity and subtlety of mind, her wise appreciation for long-term consequence, her courage, her extraordinary personal warmth, and her important financial support have been vital ingredients in sustaining the distinctive quality of her alma mater, which she so admired and loved. The College's President, his wife, its Investment Committee, and Board of Managers join with the broader Swarthmore community in expressing to Andy, her husband, and to her family, our deep affection for a remarkable individual and a valued colleague in commitment to excellence in undergraduate education. Alfred H. Bloom, President Swarthmore College
