        LEVINE-Maurice. The 92nd Street YM-YWHA Board of Directors and Staff deeply mourn the passing of Maurice Levine. As the artistic director of ''Lyrics & Lyricists'' for 27 consecutive years, Maurice lovingly guided the Y's popular series since its inception. His commitment to the 92nd Street Y's mission to enrich people's lives was shown through his 50 years of service to the institution, first as the conductor of the Y Symphonic Workshop in the 1940s and 1950s, then as director of the Y Chorale in the 1960s and 1970s and finally through his devotion to the ''L&L'' series. He will be greatly missed by us all. Our profound sympathy to his family. Philip L. Milstein, President Joseph N. Leff, Chairman Sol Adler, Executive Director
