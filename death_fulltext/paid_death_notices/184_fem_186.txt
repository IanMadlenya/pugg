        HALL-Claudia Stevenson. 91. This classically trained soprano and voice coach-with a repertoire from opera to gospel-freely shared her talent and passion for music. Petite in body, powerful in stature, her generous and humanitarian spirit was evidenced in civic/social circles in and outside New York. With impeccable style, Ms. Hall blended elegance and grace with a deep respect for compassion and friendship. God endowed Claudia with wisdom, spirit and presence; gifts she used to enrich many lives. Visitation May 29, 3-6 PM, at Rutgers Presbyterian Church, 73rd St and B'way, NYC. A service will follow.
