        CADY-Nancy Farr. Native New Yorker, resident of Orlando, FL. Passed on October 8, 2000. She will be sorely missed by her children, Gordon Marsh, Lise Pilande, Adrienne Naessil, Marion Skinner; her siblings, F. Shelton Farr, Thomas A. Farr, Diana Farr Louis and Priscilla Farr McCord and other family members who were close to her. Her sense of beauty, her delight in the comic side of life and her unconditional love for her family will remain forever in our hearts.
