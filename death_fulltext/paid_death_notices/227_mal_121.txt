        PRYOR--Richard. The Officers, Governors and Members of the Friars Club are saddened by the death of their beloved member, Richard Pryor. He was the consummate comedian who dared to break the rules and rise to become one of the most revered entertainers in the world of show business. He was a very special member of the Friars Club and his passing leaves a void in the comedy world. We cherish the legacy of laughter that he leaves behind and we are grateful for his having touched our lives through humor. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his family.
