        PARNES-Aaron. The Yeshiva University family is saddened by the passing of a respected and cherished member of the Board of Governors of the Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology, where, together with his sister-inlaw, Alice Parnes, he established the Max and Celia Parnes Family Psychological and Psychoeducational Services Clinic in memory of his parents. His kind, gentle, compassionate manner and his sense of humor will be missed by his fellow directors and by all who knew him. Heartfelt condolences are extended to his wife, Martha, to Alice Parnes, and all the members of his family. May his memory serve as a source of blessing.
