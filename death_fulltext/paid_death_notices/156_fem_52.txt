        ALSCHULER-Emily. The Officers, members and staff of The American Jewish Committee have lost a dear and cherished friend and generous supporter with the passing of Emily Alschuler. Emily was a long-time member of AJC's National Board of Governors and of her local AJC Chicago Chapter. Devoted to the pursuit of human rights for all and driven by an abiding love for the Jewish people, she served for many years as a trusted and active member of AJC's Intereligious Affairs Commission, traveling extensively on AJC missions abroad. Her tireless efforts to encourage reconciliation between Jews and Germans & to fostering positive Catholic-Jewish relations in her beloved Chicago and around the world will stand as an enduring legacy. A noble and gentle woman, her warmth, compassion and wisdom will be sorely missed. We send heartfelt condolences to her sons William and David, their wives, and her four grandchildren. Bruce M. Ramer, President David A. Harris, Exec Director Shulamith Bahat, Assoc Exec Dir
