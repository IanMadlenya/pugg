        FORSTMANN-Nicholas C. It is with profound sorrow that we mourn the untimely passing of a courageous and loving man. We were blessed to have been touched by his dignity, wisdom and playful charm. A caring mentor and true friend who met life with optimism, kindness and generosity. Our prayers are with Lana and the entire family. The beauty of Nick's memory and legacy live within everyone touched by his love. Dolores, Curtis, and Sydney Hofhine
        Nicholas C. Our community has sagged, for a pillar has fallen. But it is raised up again by the legacy you leave behind-a legacy of courage, strength, integrity, generosity and kindness. My life has been forever enriched for having known you. You are forever in my prayers. Joe Peters
