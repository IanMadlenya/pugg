        GORDON--William J. Of Baldwin on November 28, 2003. Age 74 years. Devoted husband of Evelyn (nee Pedersen) for almost 51 years. They met at Wagner College where they both sang and toured with the Wagner College choir. They became college sweethearts and were engaged on graduation day. Beloved father of Suzannah Barranco (Joseph), Laura Jane Conlon (Peter) and Diana Halle Gordon. Dear grandfather of Meredith and David Barranco and Emma and Samuel Conlon. William was very devoted to the Baldwin School District, where he served for 47 years. William loved teaching partly for the theatrics it encompassed. For the 1976 Bicentennial, he paraded as Benjamin Franklin, much to the children's delight. He was an amateur Egyptologist and had an intense love of poetry. He memorized many lengthy passages and could still quote them flawlessly before his hospitalization. One of the family's most vivid memories is him teaching them to recite Robert Frost's ''Stopping By The Woods On A Snowy Evening.'' He will be dearly missed. The family will receive friends Sunday 2-5 PM only at Weigand - Pensa Funeral Home, 2283 Grand Ave., Baldwin, NY. Religious service Monday, 10:30 AM at Bethlehem Lutheran Church. Cremation private. In lieu of flowers, donations to Bethlehem Lutheran Church, 1375 Grand Avenue, Baldwin, NY, would be appreciated.
