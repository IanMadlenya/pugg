        FREIRICH-Constance (nee Benson). On September 4, 1999 after a long illness. Ever beloved wife of Jerry, sister of Alan Benson, devoted mother to Jeff, Stephanie, Roy and Amy and their spouses. Adored grandmother of Jonathan, Elizabeth, and Tanya Freirich, Jeremy Goodman, Emily Taylor, Rachel and Hannah Curtis, and Paul and Daniel Bardinas. For her tender generosity of spirit, affection, humor and uncommon good sense, she will be sorely missed. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the American Cancer Society.
