        NORRIS--John. Died peacefully at his home in Canada on Saturday, February 11, 2006. John was a construction industry icon, legendary builder, mentor, friend, teacher, athlete, fierce competitor, jokester and renaissance man. No better man to meet and beat any challenge. His skyline signature is in the 80 tall buildings he built around the world and the individual excellence he instilled in each team member and every trademan who made the impossible, possible. His accomplished career was spent largely with Olympia and York and Forest City Ratner. His handiwork includes the World Financial Center, One Canadian Place and all of the MetroTech buildings. In recent years he brought his vast experience to Cauldwell Wingate and relished his role as mentor. He was involved in projects including Rallye Motors, 277 Park Ave and 90 Church Street. He made each of us who had the privilege to work with him better builders who defy obstacles and make time for a fish story. Our thoughts and prayers are with his loving family. A nonsectarian memorial service will be held on Monday, March 20, 2006 at St. Boniface Church, located at 109 Willoughby St., Brooklyn, N.Y. 11201 at 10:30AM. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to John's memory to the Skyscraper Museum, 39 Battery Place, Battery Park City, New York City. His presence was larger than life...his legend is larger than life. Susan L. Hayes
