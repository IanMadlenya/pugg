        KANEKO -- Mamoru. We mourn the death of our teacher, a brilliant pathologist who devoted 40 years of his life to the cause of The Mount Sinai Medical Center, and extend to his wife, Mrs. Ranko Kaneko, our condolences. The dedication to craft of this most gifted diagnostician and educator remains an inspiration to his many students. Rosemary Purrazzella, M.D. Marc Rosenblum, M.D.
