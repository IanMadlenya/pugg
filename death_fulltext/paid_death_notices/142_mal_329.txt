        HAMPTON-Henry. The Board and staff of the Charles H. Revson Foundation deeply mourn the passing of our Board member, colleague, and friend, Henry Hampton. Henry brought to the craft of film making the conviction of the educator, the eye of the artist, the subtle intelligence of the historian, the determination of the inspired messenger. His masterpiece documentary of the Civil Rights era, ''Eyes on the Prize,'' will endure as the definitive visual history of that mid-twentieth century struggle, and will inform and inspire generations of young people around the world into the next century. A quiet man, whose humanism radiated from his entire being, Henry's capacity for empathy and friendship ran deep. The nation has lost a great filmmaker; those of us who knew him have also lost a respected colleague and an unforgettable friend. Charles H. Revson Foundation Robert S. Rifkind, Chairman Eli N. Evans, President
