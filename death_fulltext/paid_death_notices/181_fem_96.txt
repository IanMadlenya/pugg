        WARD-Anne Philomena. On February 7, 2002. Daughter of the late Daniel and Bridget (nee Bonner). Predeceased in 1949 by sister, Baby Margie. Survived by brothers, Daniel and Manus. Also survived by sister-in-law, three nieces and one grandniece in VA. Predeceased by nephew Danny. In Ireland and England, Anne is survived by nine aunts and uncles. Cousins too numerous to mention survive her at home and abroad. A product of Washington Heights, NY, Anne graduated from St. Rose of Lima, St. Vincent Ferrer High School, Columbia University and N.Y.U. She lived nine years in Geneva, Switzerland and thirteen years in New Mexico. Not only an art historian, she was an artist of mixed media. She was a member of the Rainbow Artists in NM. Retired from teaching, Anne worked as a docent in the Corrales/Rio Rancho area, where she leaves countless friends. Fluent in three languages, she never drifted far from her Donegal roots. Anne almost died alone in Albuquerque; instead, due to the timely, selfless, and decisive actions of Rose Forker Ewings, she died in the company of loving family members in Cape Coral, FL. Once again Rose proved herself to be a pillar of strength to the Ward/Bonner family, and we are deeply indebted to her. Interment, with parents, in Our Lady of Mount Carmel Cemetery, Tenafly, NJ. Memorial service to be held at a later date.
