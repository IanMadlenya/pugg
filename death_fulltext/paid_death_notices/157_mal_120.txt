        ELVIRA-Pablo. New York City Opera mourns the passing of our good friend and colleague, Pablo Elvira. He joined our company in 1974 and remained with us until 1989, providing us with many memorable evenings in the theater as a leading baritone in the Italian repertory. He was a gifted artist with a larger-than-life personality and a popular company member who we will remember with great fondness. We extend our deepest sympathies to his family and his many friends.
