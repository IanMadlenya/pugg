        COHEN-Herbert C. The Stephen Gaynor School family, with deep remorse, acknowledges the passing of Mr. Herbert C. Cohen, founding chairman of its Board of Directors. He helped to pilot the school through its incipient stages of development. His business acumen and good sense were critical to the success of the Stephen Gaynor School. We will miss him.
