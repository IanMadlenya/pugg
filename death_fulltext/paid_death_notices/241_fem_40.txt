        KREISBERG--Luisa. We mourn the passing of our dear Luisa and celebrate her life. She was a passionate and persuasive advocate for the arts, a thoughtful and creative advisor, a generous mentor, and great friend. We offer our love and support to her family at this very sad time. Claire Whittaker, Stuart Klawans, Bree Jeppson and all our colleagues from The Kreisberg Group.
