        GOLD-Bernard. On Monday, September 4 at his home in New York. Bernard, an honest and gentle man, the strength of his family and friends. So loved by his wife Frederica, daughters Marianne Kaplan and Caroline, sonin-law David, grandchildren Phillip and Joseph, his sister Thelma Hurwitz and brother and Dr. and Mrs. Arnold Gold, nieces and nephews. Forever in our hearts and the hearts of many.
