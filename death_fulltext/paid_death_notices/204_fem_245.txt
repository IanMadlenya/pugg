        OSBORNE--Elizabeth Jane Gibby. Born November 29, 1930, in Elizabeth, NJ, to Edgar Budd Gibby and Beatrice Hadley Gibby; died January 20, 2004, at home. She had the great good fortune to benefit from six years of expert, caring and effective outpatient care by staff of the Cancer Institute of New Jersey and, at the end, Hospice of Princeton. She was a member of the Vail Deane School class of '48 and Goucher College '52, a 50 year member of Delta Gamma Fraternity, and proud to be Princeton University h'36. Lib/Liz/EJ soon found her way into the teaching profession, notably her 30 year career as a master teacher at Chapin School (the New Jersey one). Her marriage to Alexander P. Robinson produced two fine sons, Alexander M. Robinson, who predeceased her, and Bruce M. Robinson, living happily in South Carolina. She later honored William H. Osborne III, with 20 affectionate years of ''retread'' marriage, and his descendants with her warm love: Lynn Osborne, Wendy O. Pierce, and William H. Osborne IV, and their spouses and children. Lib never forgot a friend (or anything about him or her), hundreds of whom enjoyed her individually crafted birthday cards, year after year. She had many connections with Princeton University, counting among alumni her father, uncles, brothers, two fathersin-law, former brothers-inlaw, a cousin and a husband. In late years, she has served that University effectively as Chair of the University's Class Associates Committee, recently as In Memoriam Chair, and as a representative member of the Alumni Council's Committees on Reunions and on Class Affairs. In 2000 she was honored with an Alumni Council Award for Service to Princeton. No services are planned, but contributions will be welcomed, in Memory of Elizabeth Gibby Osborne, to Cancer Institute of New Jersey, mailed to Development Office, 195 Little Albany Street, New Brunswick, NJ 08901.
