        HENDERSON--Luther. The Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization mourns the passing of our good friend and collaborator, Luther Henderson. His first Broadway credit was dance arranger of the original ''Flower Drum Song'', something of which he was very proud. We will miss his wit, his brilliance, his musicianship and his friendship. Our condolences to Billie and the family. >>AD#
