        AINSLIE--Peter G. 58, died on April 2, 2005. Peter's friends and colleagues throughout Time Warner join in mourning his passing. Peter was a first-rate journalist at Women's Wear Daily and Time, where he covered national and international news. He served as director of media relations for the Warner Music Group from 1992 to 2000, a position that allowed him to exercise his considerable writing skills in promoting an industry for which he had a profound passion. In 2001, Peter was tapped by Time Warner corporate to create an internal companywide magazine. He handled this assignment, at a challenging time in the company's history, with extraordinary skill and flair. Under his editorship, Keywords quickly became an award-winning example of corporate communications at its best. Everything Peter did was characterized by his acute integrity, unceasing decency and gentle sense of humor. He was an editor who knew how to correct and direct without ever being condescending or hurtful. His razor-sharp mind was joined with a compassionate soul. Peter was a lover of the arts and a patron of dance. Above all, he cherished his family, his beloved Lori, his children, Erin and Patrick, his parents, brothers, and sister, and his wide circle of friends. We will miss him deeply, and while we grieve his loss, we are grateful for his life and his lasting impact on all of us. May you rest in peace, Peter.
