        MINER-Jack. The entire community of the Fire Island Synagogue expresses its most profound sorrow at the passing of its beloved founding member, officer, trustee and past president, Jack Miner. Jack Miner and the Fire Island Synagogue were synonymous; it is almost impossible to think of it without him. He led with selfless distinction and could always be counted on. He embraced all who came and who cared. He was the quintessential ''shul-mensch''; he will be missed beyond all words. To his beloved wife Rose, to his children Phyllis and Harvey Granat and Carla and Martin Miner, to his grandchildren Cary & Evelyn, Cheryl & Eugene, Colin, David & Jennifer, Steven & Stacey, and to his seven great-grandchildren, we offer our deppest condolences.
