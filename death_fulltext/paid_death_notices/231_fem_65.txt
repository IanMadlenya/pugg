        GOLD--Leona passed away peacefully at the age of 91. Leona was for many years treasurer & in charge of finances at the Henry Street Settlement. After she retired from the staff she became a member of the Board of Directors. She retired from the Board to move to Texas to be with her family. She was a key and beloved member of the management team that guided Henry Street through the 1950's, 60's and 70's. Our deepest sympathy goes to her son Daniel Gold, her daughter - in - law Barbara Gold, grandchildren David Gold, Michael Gold, Abigail Brackett, and niece Hilary Plattus.
