        CANNATA-Michael. Our deepest sympathy to his loving family at this very difficult time. Mike was a dedicated professional and devoted member of the Ruder Finn family for almost forty years. We valued his warmth, friendship, wisdom and sense of humor and he will be sorely missed. We are heartbroken by his sudden loss but take comfort in the many fond memories we have of our years together. David Finn, Peter Finn, Kathy Bloomgarden, Amy Binder, Dena Merriam, Roz Safrin, and all at Ruder Finn.
