        KEFALIDIS-Nikos. The directors and employees of Beta Steel Corp. of Portage, Indiana express their own deep sorrow while extending profound sympathy to the entire Kefalidis family on the untimely death of our founder, Chairman of the Board of Directors and indomitable helmsman. Through times both good and bad, his vision, wisdom and compassion provided us with the courage to do the right thing, as well as the strength to endure and overcome misfortune. He stood by all of us, supporting and encouraging us, more than just as an employer, but as a genuine friend. His door would always open, in response to our knock for every single need, whether personal or professional. We mourn the loss of an exceptional leader, a dedicated executive, a loyal friend and-in every sense of the definition-a ''good man.''
