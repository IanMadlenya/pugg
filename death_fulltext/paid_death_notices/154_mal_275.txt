        LORD-J. Couper. The Trustees of St. Andrew's Dune Church mourn the departure of one of our greatest leaders, the third longest-serving Trustee in the 121 years since our founding, the longest serving Trustee officer and the longest serving President of the Trustees. Coupie served with 36 of these 70 men and women who have been Trustees since 1879; He lead the Dune Church into its second century of service to the Southampton community. He will be missed by the Southampton community and the thousands who have worshiped with him each summer at the Dune Church. We thank God for the gift of his leadership, for the honor of serving with him and for the peace that finally is his. The Trustees of St. Andrew's Dune Church, Southampton, New York
