        SALKOV--Hazzan Abraham The Cantors Assembly records with sorrow the passing of our revered colleague of over five decades, a wonderful Hazzan, brilliant composer who quietly and gently served the spiritual needs of the Jewish community of Baltimore, MD for over 30 years with dignity, warmth and care. We extend our sympathy to his family and loved ones. May his memory abide as a blessing. Hazzan Jacob Mendelson, President Hazzan Stephen J. Stein, Executive Vice President Hazzan Abraham B.
