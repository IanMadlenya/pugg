        SORGE-Rod. The Harm Reduction Coalition and the activists and participants in the harm reduction community profoundly grieve the loss of a dear friend, clever thinker, and a persistent and brave voice. Setting forth on the ''heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night,'' Rod died at 30 in his home in Manhattan of AIDS-related causes. We wish you a peaceful journey, and we'll miss you more than words can express.
        SORGE-Rod. To our dear friend, we loved you very much. We'll miss you deeply. Allan and Cynthia Clear
