        O'NEIL--John B., 58, passed away very suddenly on July 17, 2006. He was employed loyally by Hillard-Farber & Co., a government bond brokerage company on Wall St. John was a loving son of the late George and Beatrice O'Neil, wonderful brother to Susan, Michael, Jane and Ann, dear brother-in-law to Ralph Pucci, Susan O'Neil and Bill Connelly, loving and doting uncle to Evan and Tara Lynch, Mike, Rory and Paula O'Neill, Jennifer and Mike Nolin, Nicole and Mike Pucci. Johnny O will always be remembered for his zany antics, magnificent storytelling, his wonderful if somewhat irreverent sense of humor, and his kind, loving and compassionate feelings toward all his friends and family. He will be missed by all that he has touched.
