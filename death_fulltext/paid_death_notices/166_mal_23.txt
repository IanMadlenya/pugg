        FELSINGER-Mortimer Nathaniel. The generations of families who have grown and built enduring friendships at Camp Monroe, express their deepest gratitude to our friend whose strength and steadiness behind the scenes supported their summer home. He was a source of wisdom, integrity and guidance, especially for the Camp partners, as he modeled those qualities humbly, yet impeccably, in his own dealings with others. Even in our grief at his sudden departure from us, he is an inspiration of assurance in the Jewish beliefs which guided his life. We extend our deepest sympathy to all of the members of the Felsinger family. Wilson and Patricia Alling Lenny and Sam Amdurer David and Ellen Krieger Bruce and Nancy Rothstein
