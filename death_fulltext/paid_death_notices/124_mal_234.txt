        BARON-Samuel. The Aaron Copland School of Music at Queens College mourns the untimely passing of our esteemed and dearly loved colleague Samuel Baron. He was truly irreplaceable as an artist, teacher and person. As founding member of the New York Woodwind Quintet he was responsible more than anyone else for the astounding growth that wind chamber music has had during the second half of the 20th century. He will be dearly missed. Our heartfelt condolences are extended to the members of his family. Allen Lee Sessoms, President Raymond Erickson, Dean Hubert Howe, Jr, Director
