        O'KELLY--Eugene D. The Partnership for New York City mourns the loss of Eugene O'Kelly, former CEO of KPMG and member of the Partnership's Executive Committee and Board of Directors since 2003. Gene's commitment to improving the lives and economic wellbeing of New Yorkers helped raise our standard of corporate citizenship. He was one of those rare leaders who was not only respected but also loved by those who had the opportunity to know him.
