        SATTY--Glenn J. on May 13, age 58 after a courageous battle with melanoma. Beloved brother, uncle, cousin, friend, teacher and colleague. Glenn enlightened and enriched those of us who were fortunate to know him. He was an unforgettable personality, generous, inventive, inquisitive, entertaining, and the consummate host. He was a truly independent thinker. He pursued elegant solutions and encouraged others to do the same. In his limited time, he lived a full and rewarding life, worked hard, traveled the world. He savored the best of everything. He graduated from Hobart William Smith Colleges, went on to a masters degree in mathematics from Stamford, and masters and Ph.D. degrees in philosophy from Boston College. He taught mathematics at the Lawrenceville School, Northeastern University and Hobart College. He then moved to the financial services field where he spent the balance of his career, holding positions of increasing responsibility beginning with O'Connor Partners. He was a Principal of SBC/OC, Managing Director of Human Resources at UBS/Warburg, and Global Head of Education, Development, Sourcing and Assessment. Glenn was Chief Operating Officer of Arbitrade Holdings, and then became Senior Vice President, Chief Technology Officer and member of the Executive Committee for the Knight Trading Group in Jersey City. He was in charge of operations and control for Telluride Asset Management, a multistrategy hedge fund that he co-founded in 2002. Glenn served as a Governor of the Pacific Exchange and an advisor to the MIT program in Financial Engineering and Fairfield University School of Business. Most recently he worked as an independent consultant to major financial service firms. The family would appreciate donations in his memory to Hobart and William Smith College, Geneva, New York.
