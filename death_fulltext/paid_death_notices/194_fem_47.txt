        ROSE-Beverly Williams. Loving wife and best friend to her husband of 56 years, Eddie. Wonderful and caring mother to her sons Hadley, Brad and Keith and her daughters-in-law Robin and Katherine and her grandchildren Lucas, Zak and Erin. And, of course, to the honorary 4th sons whom she opened her home and heart to over the years. She'll always be remembered by her longtime friends from Belle Harbor, N.Y. and The Fountains in Lake Worth, FL. Her friends and the members at Engineers, Island Hills and Inwood Country Clubs will always recall her as a funny, bright and terrific person and a good golfer to boot. There really is no one to replace her and we'll all miss her very much. There is a great sadness now but we'll always smile when we think of her. She was one teriffic lady.
