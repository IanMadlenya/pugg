        $(6$)GLICK--Doris. In memory of Doris Glick whose marriage to Louis of more than 60 years was one of deep love, devotion, adoration and mutual respect. Each one supported the other so that their union produced not only tremendous success in business, but resulted in the true treasure of their beautiful family. Her elegance and majesty, sincerity, and religious conviction are reflected in all her children, grandchildren and great grandchildren, who truly personify the woman she was.
