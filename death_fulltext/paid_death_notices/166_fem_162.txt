        FALK-Pauline. With deep regret we note the passing of our esteemed honorary Board member, Pauline Falk. She was a devoted and valuable leader of the JDC for many years, until ill health forced her to curtail her activities. Pauline came to her JDC commitment naturally. Her father was the illustrious Paul Baerwald, President of the JDC 1932-1940 and 1944-1945. May her example be our inspiration. We express our condolences to her children Pat, Michael, and Nancy and to their families. Jonathan W. Kolker-President Michael Schneider Executive Vice President Ambassador Milton A. Wolf Chairman of the Board

With her husband, Mrs. Falk was a Founding Friend of Japan Society Gallery and her leadership, unfailing enthusiasm and wise counsel over the years were instrumental in its development.
