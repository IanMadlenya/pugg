        LEITZER--Jane Schaap. Died peacefully in Portland, ME on January 6, 2005 at age 86. She is survived by her loving daughters Joan Leitzer, M.D. of Portland and Ellen Leitzer, Esq. of Albuquerque, NM, her son-in-law Kenneth Spirer, and grandchildren Kathryn, William and Laren Spirer and Sara Silverstein. Jane grew up in NYC, was educated at the Ethical Culture School, Fieldston, and Mt. Holyoke College. Her passion was travel and she began her own program placing American teenagers with French families in Aix-en-Provence. She remained a travel agent for many years. Her other passions included cooking, reading and supporting Democratic candidates. She railed against the alleged 2004 election of G.W. Bush. After eight decades in the New York City area, Jane moved to Maine five years ago to be nearer her family. A remembrance will be held in New York in March.
