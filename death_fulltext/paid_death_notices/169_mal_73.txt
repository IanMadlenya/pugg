        SCHWARTZ-Harry. With his keen intelligence and humor he was a treasure to his family and friends. He served in the Marine Corps during World War II and was a graduate of NYU and a recipient of a Yale University Fellowship. He was the youngest and first Jewish president of the National Housewares Household Association and was well respected and admired in the industry. A very sensitive, deeply caring man with grace, vigor and compassion, he leaves an unfillable void in the lives of his beloved wife Frances, daughter Deborah, son-in-law Roger, and adoring grandchildren James, Abigail and her husband Mark. A truly remarkable man, he will be sorely missed by all whose lives he touched.
