        RUBIN-David W. The House of Steinway & Sons notes with deep sadness the passing of our former Senior Vice President and Director of our Concert and Artist Department, David W. Rubin, on May 6 in NYC at the age of 83. Mr. Rubin began his career at Steinway & Sons in 1964 at the invitation of Henry Z. Steinway to head its Concert and Artist Department. In 1979 he was appointed Vice President and assumed additional responsibilities as head of Steinway's public relations program. In 1982 he was named Senior Vice President, a post which he held until his retirement in 1986. A graduate of Princeton, Mr. Rubin studied piano with Alexander Lipsky and Robert Casadesus. He also worked as an artist representative from 1945 to 1956, managing the careers of Ania Dorfman, Grant Johannesen, The Juilliard String Quartet, and George Tozzi among others. His dedication to the Steinway piano was unwavering. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his daughter, Capers, and to his family. Bruce A. Stevens, President Peter B. Goodrich, VP Concert and Artist Activities
