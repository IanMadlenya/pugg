        BLOCK-Irving, Rabbi. Disabled and Alone/Life Services for the Handicapped Board, members and staff extend their profound condolences to the family of Rabbi Irving Block. He was an enthusiastic and committed member of the board from the inception of the organization until his death. His belief in the Brotherhood of all human beings extended to the physically and mentally handicapped. We pray that Mrs. Phyllis Block and the family of Herbert Block will find consolation in the many good deeds of Rabbi Irving Block and the many friends that responded to his ideals. Leslie D. Park, Chairman Roslyn Brilliant, Executive Director
