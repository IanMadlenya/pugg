        KOPPELMAN -- Julius. The American Jewish Committee is profoundly saddened by the death of a gifted leader, treasured friend and generous benefactor, Julius Koppelman. Julius, an AJC Honorary Vice President, and his beloved late wife Dorothy were longtime members of the AJC family, serving on our National Board of Governors, National Leadership Council and Horizon Society. In honor of their 50th wedding anniversary in 1993, they endowed AJC's Julius and Dorothy Koppelman Institute on American Jewish-Israeli Relations to help build stronger bonds of friendship and understanding between our communities. We were proud to honor Julius with AJC's Avraham Harman Award in 2001. A man of great integrity and gentility, Julius supported, in word and deed, a host of meaningful causes and did so always with a quiet grace and kind heart. His passion for Israel and for the physical, social and spiritual well-being of the Jewish people was boundless. Indeed, he left this world a brighter and more hopeful place than he found it and his legacy of goodness will long be remembered. We send our deepest condolences to his four daughters and their families, and to all who grieve the passing of this extraordinary man. E. Robert Goodkind, Pres. David A. Harris, Exec. Dir. Shulamith Bahat, Assoc. Exec. Dir. Harold Shapiro, Chairman, Koppelman Institute Dr. Steven Bayme, Director Koppelman Institute
