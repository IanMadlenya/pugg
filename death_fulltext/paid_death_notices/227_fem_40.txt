        GEFFEN - Florence. Born September 6, 1911 in Manchester, NH. Died peacefully in her sleep after a long illness. Mrs. Geffen was surrounded by a most extraordinary group of caregivers. She came to New York in 1931 to teach music theory at Teachers College. Florence was an accomplished pianist, who loved music deeply, from the Etudes of Chopin to the operas of Wagner. A terrific golfer, she had three holes in one. Florence was a great gal, full of fun and generous to a fault. She embodied beauty and elegance and we will miss her. Her husband Max and brothers Walter and Hap preceded her in death. She is survived by her son Pete, his wife Elaine and their son Will, who has inherited his grandmother's wonderful golf swing; also nieces Wendy, Bonnie and Barbara and stepchildren Melinda and Roger and their children. Memorial service Friday, January 13, 2006, 3:30 PM at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st St.
