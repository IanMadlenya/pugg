        STERNBERG-Charles (Carel). The Board of Directors, the staff and the worldwide family of the International Rescue Committee (IRC) are deeply saddened by the death on January 16, 2003, of our former Executive Director, who devoted his life to the cause of refugees and human rights. As a refugee himself from his native Czechoslovakia, Carel carried out his first humanitarian assignment in 1941 in Marseille, where he helped hundreds of targets of the Nazi Gestapo make their way out of occupied France. After reaching the United States and serving three years in the U.S. Army, he rejoined the International Rescue Committee in 1946. Thereafter, he assumed increasing responsibilities as the IRC responded to refugee crises worldwide and resettled tens of thousands of refugees in the United States. From 1965 to 1985, he served with distinction as Executive Director. Until his final illness, he was an active volunteer, Secretary of the IRC and member of our Board and Executive Committee. We express our heartfelt sympathy to his beloved wife, Irma Kadmon Sternberg; his sister, Ella Rosenheck of Bayside, N.Y.; his niece, Michelle Eisner of Hollis Hills, N.Y., and his nephew, Doron Rosenheck of Plainview, N.Y.
