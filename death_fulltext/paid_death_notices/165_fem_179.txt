        SNITOW-Virginia. The Trustees of the Hunter College Foundation and the entire college community mourn the loss of Virginia Snitow (nee Levitt), who was a tireless supporter of the college and its mission of research, education and service. An alumna and founding member of the Hunter College Foundation, Mrs. Snitow was also an active member of the Scholarship and Welfare Fund. In addition, she served on the Committee for the Restoration of Roosevelt House, was a member of the Hunter College Hall of Fame and was a loyal supporter of the Hunter College Women's Studies Program. We will miss her commitment and dedication to the college, and we extend our condolences to her daughter, Ann, and her son, Alan. Evangelos J. Gizis, Interim President Hunter College Allan H. Kurtzman, Chair Hunter College Foundation
