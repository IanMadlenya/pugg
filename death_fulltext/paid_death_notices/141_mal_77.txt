        McDOWALL-Roddy. The Board of Trustees and staff of the Bay Street Theater are deeply saddened by the loss of a dear friend, Mr. Roddy McDowall. His generosity of spirit, loyalty, humor and talent will be sorely missed. He will always be remembered for his contributions to the world of film and theater, and especially to this theater and this community.
