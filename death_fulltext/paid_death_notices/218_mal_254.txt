        KENNAN--George F. The Council on Foreign Relations and Foreign Affairs magazine mourn the passing of George Kennan, author of the doctrine of containment and one of the most important articles in the hstory of American foreign policy, ''The Sources of Soviet Conduct.'' A member of the Council for 59 years, George Kennan exemplified the best of America's diplomatic tradition. His writing and analysis, like the man himself, were distinguished for grace of style, clarity of thought, and force of argument. The Council and Foreign Affairs have been honored by our long association with him. We offer our sincerest sympathy to nis wife, Annelise, his son Christopher, and the other members of his family.
