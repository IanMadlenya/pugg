        ADLER--Herbert S., 63. Undaunted by the vicissitudes of life, Herbert Adler flourished. He selflessly gave of himself to scores of friends, family members, coworkers and even random people he happened to meet in delis, dry cleaners, and fancy balls. His untimely passing leaves a void that can only be filled by knowing how many people carry his love in their hearts forever. He was a prominent businessman, tireless philanthropist, and patron of the arts. The Adler family will try very hard to continue to live by his example. Contributions may be sent to The Adler Family Fund for the History of Art at Williams College, c/o Diana Elvin, 75 Park Street, Williamstown, MA. 01267.

During the decade of our association, Herb contributed significantly to Halcyon's growth, and his skill at developing and maintaining close client relationships will be missed.
