        BIDWELL--Mary Kane. Beloved wife of the late chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, J. Truman Bidwell, Mary Kane Bidwell, 96, died in her sleep Monday at her Manhattan apartment. Mrs. Bidwell had a long and distinguished career in charity work. As vice president of the Youth Consultation Service, she founded Dana House, a home for unwed mothers, under the Diocese of the Episcopal Church. She served on the boards of the Arthritis and Rheumatism Foundation, the New York Infirmary, and the Traveler's Aid, and was the only woman appointed to the New York Council of the Navy League, of which she became vice chairman. In these capacities she chaired numerous charity balls. But the accomplishment of which she was most proud was the Servicemen's Service, which she organized and ran during WW II. A nonprofit shopping service for men on active duty overseas, it made it possible for them to give gifts to loved ones at home. The Service had 100 volunteers shopping for soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, buying gifts ''from pins to pianos,'' as she put it on her daily radio program. She is survived by her son, J. Truman Bidwell, Jr., her daughter, Barbara Bidwell Manuel, four granddaughters and ten great-grandchildren. Funeral service will be held today, 1pm, at St. James Episcopal Church, Madison and 71st St.
