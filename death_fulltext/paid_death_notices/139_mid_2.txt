        ENGEL-Malvina. The Board of Directors and staff of Israel Policy Forum expresses heartfelt condolences to our beloved Executive Vice President, Jonathan Jacoby and his family for the loss of his grandmother, Malvina Engel (Anyu). Jonathan's mother, Erika Jacoby once wrote, ''While others can't keep a plant alive, Anyu can breathe life into the lonely leaf she has just pinched off the stem and dug into the soil.'' We know that Anyu will rest peacefully knowing that her legacy will endure in her children, grandchildren and greatgrandchildren.
