        KROLL-Florence (nee Yondorf). On June 10, 1999 at the age of 80 of Rye, NY, formerly of Bayside and Bedford NY, and Cranbury, NJ. Beloved wife of the late Herman, loving mother of Daniel, Nancy Kroll Margolis, Susan Kroll-Smith, and Jules, adoring grandmother of Aimee, Kara, Seth, Nicholas, Vanessa, Dana and Jeremy, devoted mother-in-law of Paul, Terry and Lynn, cherished sister-in-law of Bea and Hy Michaels. A fine, compassionate, unpretentious woman, Florence was warm and funloving with great inner strength and a keen sense of humor. She achieved her fondest amibitions: to be a good wife, mother and grandmother. She was a Vice President of Bayside Jewish Center Sisterhood. She was an artist, and in her youth a beauty queen and a member of the Jamaica High School Swim Team. Florence was a beautiful woman in face and spirit and had a strong, independent character. She never complained and always did her best. She was loved by all who knew her. She will be loved and missed by her family with every passing day and will be in our hearts forever. Service Friday, at 12 noon at ''Riverside Memorial Chapel'', 21 W. Broad St, Mt. Vernon, N.Y. Internment will follow at Beth Moses Cemetery. In lieu of flowers, contributions in her memory may be made to The Hospice Of Westchester or Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital.
