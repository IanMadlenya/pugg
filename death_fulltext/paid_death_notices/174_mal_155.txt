        ASHLEY-Charles Allen, M.D. The Trustees and staff of Bassett Healthcare mourn the loss of our former Director, Charles Allen Ashley, M.D. Under Dr. Ashley's leadership (1967-1984), Bassett experienced significant growth in terms of the number of patients served, expanded medical education programs and innovative research initiatives. Dr. Ashley also founded Bassett's philanthropic support organization, The Friends of Bassett. Dr. Ashley originally joined Bassett in 1947 as an intern. He returned in 1955 as an Associate Pathologist. He conducted considerable research, which generated numerous publications. Following his retirement, Dr. Ashley continued as a consultant until 1988. Our deepest condolences to his wife, Audrey, and his entire family. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The Friends of Bassett, One Atwell Road, Cooperstown, New York 13326; Cornell University, 55 Brown Road, Ithaca, NY 14850; or Cornell University Medical College, 1300 York Ave., Box 61, New York, NY 10021.
