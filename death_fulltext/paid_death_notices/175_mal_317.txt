        SCHNABEL-Karl Ulrich. The Manhattan School of Music is saddened by the loss of distinguished faculty member Karl Ulrich Schnabel. A renowned member of our piano faculty from 1985-2000, his wisdom, compassion, and sense of grand tradition enriched the lives of his many students. As a colleague and friend he will be sorely missed by all. We extend our most heartfelt sympathy to his family. David A. Rahm, Chairman, Board of Trustees Marta Istomin, President
