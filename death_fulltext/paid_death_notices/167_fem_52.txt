        CONVISSOR-Carole. The Juilliard School deeply mourns the passing of Carole Convissor, one of the most respected and cherished members of our community. A member of the School's administrative staff since 1982, as Director of Special Projects, she lovingly developed numerous special events that had an enormously positive impact on all who experienced them. With care and sensitivity in all that she touched, she was a special friend to Juilliard's trustees, students, faculty, administrators and alumni. Our condolences are extended to her beloved husband, Sam, and her children and grandchildren. She will be deeply missed by us all. Her legacy will continue to live at Juilliard for many years to come. Mary Rodgers Guettel, Chairman of the Board Joseph W. Polisi, President
