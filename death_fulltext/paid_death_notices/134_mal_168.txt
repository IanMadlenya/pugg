        JOYCE-Donald. On Tuesday, March 10, 1998, at age 45, of cancer. Extraordinary musician, brilliant organist, imaginative and curious intellect, international organ ambassador of old and new music, beloved son and brother, loving and loyal friend to many. In addition to his Juilliard degrees, he held the Premier Prix de Virtuosite (with Distinction) from the Geneva Conservatory where he worked with Lionel Rogg, as well as other international competition prizes. During the Bach tercentenary year 1985 he performed all the organ works of Bach to great acclaim in thirteen recitals in New York, and was scheduled to repeat this series at the Lincoln Center Festival '98. Many performances and two CD's grew out of another great interest, in Iberian and Mexican organ music; at his death he was writing a monograph on Mexican historic organs. All his life he was a strong advocate for contemporary organ music, performing and recording many new works. He was Music Director and Organist at the Church of the Holy Apostles in Chelsea; Organist at the Central Synagogue and taught organ at Queens College. As winner of a Fulbright-Garcia Robles grant from the U.S. and Mexican governments, he established a class in organ studies at the University of Guanajuato, Mexico last summer. Survivors include his mother, Anne Rose; his father, Walter Joyce; brother Kenneth Joyce; and sisters Carol Bochner and Virginia Keil. A service will be held Saturday, March 28 at 1 P.M. at the Church of the Holy Apostles, 9th Avenue, at 28th., NYC 10001. In lieu of flowers donations may be made either to the Organ Fund at the above church or to the Donald Joyce Scholarship Fund at the Copland School of Music, Queens College, Flushing, N.Y. 11367.
