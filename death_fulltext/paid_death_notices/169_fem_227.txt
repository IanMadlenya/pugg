        THOMAS-Martha (Poppi). It is with deep sorrow that the Board of Trustees and staff of The Animal Medical Center mark the passing of our devoted Chairman Emerita, Mrs. Joseph A. (Poppi) Thomas. Mrs. Thomas' passionate belief in the important role of animals in our lives led to her tireless work for 44 years as an active member of our board, serving for 12 years as Chairman. Her generosity of spirit, her integrity and her unwavering commitment to improving the care of animals served as an inspiration to us all. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to her family and all those who were touched by her joy of living and the warmth of her friendship. Cynthia Phipps Chairman Guy Pidgeon, DVM, DACVIM President and CEO
