        SOLOV--Zachary. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of Zachary Solov, the company's chief choreographer and ballet master from 1951 to 1956. He continued to work with the company through the 1980's, and his choreography was seen in 28 operas as well as two ballets. A mentor and friend to generations of Met dancers, he will be sorely missed. We extend our sincerest sympathies to his family and friends. Joseph Volpe, General Mgr. James Levine, Music Dir.
