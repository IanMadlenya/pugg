        LEVENSTEIN -- Dr. Phyllis. Died in Rome on May 28, 2005 at the age of 88. Beloved wife of the late Sidney, loving mother of Susan and Daniel. A clinical psychologist who continued practicing until the very end, she founded, and directed for over thirty years, The Parent-Child Home Program, a national early literacy, parenting, and school readiness program. In 1965, she identified parent-child interaction as the key to the development of early language skills, and working with her statistician husband created a pioneering model program. The cost-effective Program helps educationally disadvantaged families prepare their children to enter school ready to succeed. There are now over 145 replications of the Program across the country. Tens of thousands of Program families and staff mourn her passing. A memorial service will be held in the Bay Area in July and in New York at a later date. Contributions in her memory may be made to The ParentChild Home Program (www.parent-child.org)
