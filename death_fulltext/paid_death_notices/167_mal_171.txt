        PISANO-Ronald G. The Board of Trustees and Staff of the Heckscher Museum of Art are deeply saddened at the loss of our longtime friend, supporter, and colleague, Ronald G. Pisano. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his family and friends. The art world has lost a brilliant scholar, author, curator and advocate. The definitive authority on the work of William Merritt Chase, Ronald Pisano curated numerous exhibitions and authored several books focussing attention on the artist, his followers and Long Island landscape. Ronald's contributions to the Heckscher Museum of Art have been vital to our growth. His talent, generosity and knowledge have benefited the Museum in innumerable ways. From co-authoring the Catalogue of the Collection to curating exhibitions, to personally contributing to the richness of the collection. Above all, he was a valued friend, gentle soul and a colleague who will be greatly missed.
