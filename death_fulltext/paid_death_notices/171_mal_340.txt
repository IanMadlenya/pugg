        O'CONNELL-Stephen. The Ardsley School District is saddened by the loss of a distinguished leader, Stephen O'Connell, beloved husband of Mary and devoted father of Matthew, Mark, Stephen and Michael. As Principal of both the Ardsley Middle and High Schools, he inspired students, teachers and parents. He will be remembered as a tireless administrator and an eloquent speaker with an engaging sense of humor. We will miss his guiding spirit and commitment to excellence. A memorial service will be held at Ardsley H.S. on Friday, May 4 at 10 AM. Donations may be made to the Ardsley Education Foundation.
