        LEITMAN-Reggie. We deeply mourn the passing of Reggie Leitman, an ardent Zionist and a longtime community leader. She and her late husband, Aleck, were deeply treasured for their heartfelt generosity and philanthropic efforts. As major benefactors of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, they supported numerous causes and established Endowment Funds to aid undergraduate and graduate students. Through the donation of the Aleck and Reggie Leitman Humanities building, they were instrumental in rebuilding the Mt. Scopus Campus. We extend our deepest sympathies to her family. American Friends of The Hebrew University Keith L. Sachs, President Fred S. Lafer, Chairman of the Board Adam B. Kahan, Executive Vice President
