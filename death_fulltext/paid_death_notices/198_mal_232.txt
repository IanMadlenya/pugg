        FULD--Judge Stanley H. Kaye Scholer LLP mourns the loss of the Hon. Judge Stanley H. Fuld, who passed away on July 22, 2003 at the age of 99. Judge Fuld was associate judge of the New York Court of Appeals from 1946 until 1966, and Chief Judge of that court from 1967 through 1973. For some 18 years, as Special Counsel to our firm after his retirement from the bench, Judge Fuld made an important contribution to our firm's appellate practice and was sought after as a just and fair arbitrator and mediator. The legal community has lost an esteemed member of the bar, and we have lost a good friend and colleague.
        FULD--Judge Stanley H. Special beloved family friend, leader in the law. Fellow graduate of Columbia Law with my dad (Henry N. Rapaport) during the 20's. My brother and I followed them in the 60's. We will miss his quiet, dignified manner and playful wry sense of humor and his insightful thoughts on ethics and the law. Jo-Ann & Michael Rapaport
