        GOLDBERG -- Mark Trent. Died suddenly of a massive heart attack on May 18, 2005 in San Francisco, California. Mark was Executive Director of The Ira and Leonore Gershwin Trusts, working closely, for 22 years, with the Trustee of the estate established by the late Leonore Strunsky Gershwin, which holds and manages the copyrights of her late husband, the lyricist, Ira Gershwin. Mark also managed the Gershwin Archive, worked closely with the Library of Congress, and in 1999, he restored the material for the City Center Encores' production of the 1936 Ziegfeld Follies. He was the loving son of Gene and Mary Goldberg of San Jose, California, and friend and colleague to countless members of the American Musical Theater community.
