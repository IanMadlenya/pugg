        KESTENBAUM-Ralph. The sudden death of our father on January 21st, 1999 has removed the touchstone from our lives. His commitment to his family, his integrity and the regard in which he was held by all who knew him leave us with some measure of comfort. Deena and Itamar (Tel Aviv) Jonathan and Deborah (London) Daniel and Hadassah (Teaneck, NJ) Ryel (Los Angeles)
