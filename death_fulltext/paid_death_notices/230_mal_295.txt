        SCOTT--Eugene L. The U.S. Tennis Association Eastern Section Board of Directors, volunteers, staff and member organizations are profoundly saddened by the passing of our dear friend and colleague, Gene Scott, a board member and past president of the association. Gene spread the good news about tennis for 50 years--as a world ranked player, tournament director, author, television producer and commentator and through the written word in Tennis Week magazine, which he founded in 1974. We extend our sympathies to his family, especially his wife, Polly, and his children, Lucy and Sam.
