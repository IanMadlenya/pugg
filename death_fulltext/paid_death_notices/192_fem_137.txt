She was the second person to demonstrate such transformation and the first to do it with Hemophilus influenza. She then developed strains of H. Influ with characteristics of two antigen types in a single particle. In the late 1970s and early 80s, she worked with Dr. Katherine Sprunt to exploit the naturally occurring protective value of interbacterial interactions to prevent bacterial infection in the neonate.
