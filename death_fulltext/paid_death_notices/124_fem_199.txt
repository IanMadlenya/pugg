        PERLMAN-Sidney. The partners, associates and staff of Podell, Rothman, Schechter & Banfield mourn the loss of our dear friend and client, the distinguished chairman of the board of Adams & Co. Real Estate. Sidney will be missed by all of us, but especially by our senior partner, Bert Podell, with whom Sidney worked closely and passionately on behalf of Israel and the Jewish people. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to Mrs. Perlman and her family. Podell, Rothman, Schechter & Banfield
