        ZANKEL--Arthur. The Patrons Program is deeply saddened by the death of Arthur Zankel, the Patron of Our Lady of Mercy School in the Bronx. Because of Arthur's generosity, Our Lady of Mercy's inner-city elementary school children enjoyed academic learning and outstanding enhancement programs in a wellmaintained environment. He particularly admired the school's principal and profoundly cared about the well being and success of the students. He kept all of us on our toes with his quick wit and astute observations. His presence will be sorely missed at Our Lady of Mercy School. We extend our sincerest sympathy to Judy and his family. William Finneran, Chairman, The Patrons Program Jill Kafka, Executve Director, The Patrons Program
