        SOMKIN-Lawrence B. An honorable, noble man; a wonderful human being. Larry was kind, generous and thoughtful. He had excellent taste and judgment. Larry was a man of integrity. He had a talent for getting things done, and done well. Larry knew how to live and enjoy the best that life had to offer. We, who have loved him, will miss him. We will remember him.
