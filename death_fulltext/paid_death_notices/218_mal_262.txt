        STERN--Harry. The American Friends of The Hebrew University and The Hebrew University of Jerusalem mourn the passing of Harry Stern, an AFHU Guardian and enduring supporter of Israel. Mr. Stern devoted himself to insuring a brighter future for the Jewish State by providing vital resources for university research. The Harry Stern National Center for the Study and Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease, established at The Hebrew University, pays lasting tribute to Harry Stern's philanthropic spirit. We extend our sympathy to his entire family. AFHU Ira Lee Sorkin, President Keith L. Sachs, Chair Peter T.
