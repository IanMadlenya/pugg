Until her illness, she was a dedicated and resourceful leader with a marvelous capacity for optimism and fun. She was the president of the ''Junior Committee'' and board member of the NY section of the National Council of Jewish Women. She was a tireless fundraiser for the Jewish causes in which she believed and her efforts for Council and UJA/Federation were extraordinary. Her indomitable spirit and concern for those less fortunate was an integral part of her life. She was a truly spiritual and moral human being who believed and never lost her faith in God. She leaves her family and the world with a wonderful legacy. We will remember her for her devotion and generosity of spirit. We will miss her enthusiasm and critical eye. We will think of her and love her forever. May she rest in peace. Funeral Service Sunday January 5, 2003, 11:30 AM at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street.
