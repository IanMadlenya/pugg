        GLASSMAN--Roz. Beloved companion of Al Tarantal. Adoring aunt, caring cousin, best friend, she was all of these things to those who knew her. A fine potter, just as she combined beauty with imagination when it came to creating a clay piece, so she did with life. She worked hard at friendship, sowing seeds of warmth, love and respect. She shall be sorely missed. Memorial service 10 AM, Saturday, September 13th, at Church of the Holy Apostles, 9th Avenue at 28th Street.
