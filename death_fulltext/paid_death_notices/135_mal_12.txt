        CHEHEBAR-Gabriel. The Officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation are deeply saddened by the death of Gabriel Chehebar, a dedicated supporter and prominent leader of New York's Syrian Sephardic community. He was a dynamic founder of Congregation Ahaba Ve'Ahva, and a well-known philanthropist at the Sephardic Community Center in Brooklyn. A native of Egypt, he was a founder of the Shehebar Sephardic Center in Jerusalem and a frequent participant in UJA President's missions. We convey our heartfelt sympathy to his wife, Marcelle; sons and daughters-inlaw, Albert and Joyce, Isaac and Marilyn, Jacob and Marilyn, Joseph and Terri; daughter and son-in-law, Giselle and Raymond Habert, his grandchildren, and his entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair Louise B. Greilsheimer, President Eddie Catton, Chair, Syrian Sephardic Campaign Stephen D. Solender, Exec. V.P.
