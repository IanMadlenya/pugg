        ORMISTON-Ginger. Died tragically on September 11, 2001 in the World Trade Center. We mourn the death of our very special friend, Ginger. She made us feel like a part of her family with her love, her great sense of humor, and her easy acceptance of others. Ginger made our daughter, Maia, feel like a sister to her two children, Beth and Billy. Our love goes out to them and to her husband and our friend, Jim Kenworthy. She will always be in our hearts.
