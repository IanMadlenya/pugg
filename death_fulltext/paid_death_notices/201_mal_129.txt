        RENCKENS--James R. With deep sorrow the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, its Board of Directors and staff mourn the passing of James Renckens. Jim joined the NMSS Minnesota Chapter Board of Trustees in 1991, serving as Chair from 1993-1996; he was elected to the National Board in 2003. He was awarded the Norman Cohn Hope Award in 2001, in recognition of his volunteer leadership service to the Society, and was to receive the Philanthropist of the Year Award in November 2003. Jim's commitment and dedication to the MS cause will be truly missed. Jim is survived by his wife Debbie and children Denise, Elizabeth, Stephanie, Cathleen, Richard and Michael. Memorials may be sent to the National MS Society, Minnesota Chapter, 200 12th Avenue South, Minneapolis, MN 55415. We extend our sincere sympathy to his entire family. Edward A. Kangas, Chairman of the Board Mike Dugan, President and CEO
