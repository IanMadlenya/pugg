        FABER-Rabbi Salamon. We record with sorrow the passing of our beloved colleague who was ordained in 1938 at the Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau. During his career, he served congregations in Europe and the United States, having retired in 1976 from Kew Gardens Jewish Center after 22 years of distinguished service. He was a member of the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of The Rabbinical Assembly for many years. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife Gertrude, his children Eli, Fredda, and Michael and to all who were touched through his rabbinate. Rabbi Seymour L. Essrog, President Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Executive Vice President The Rabbinical Assembly
