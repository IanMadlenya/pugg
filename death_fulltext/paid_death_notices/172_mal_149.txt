        GIBSON-Dr. Weldon B. Passed away on May 6 in his home on the Stanford University campus. A founding executive of SRI International, a non-profit research institute formerly known as ''Stanford Research Institute'', Dr. Gibson was 84 years old and is survived in loving memory by his wife Helen, son David, and grandson Ruben. Dr. Gibson was a key person at SRI for 54 of the Institute's 55 years. Throughout his remarkable career, Dr. Gibson was a leader who brought SRI to worldwide prominence. He organized more than 80 major international conferences for executives. In recognition of his contributions and achievements, SRI International founded the Weldon B. Gibson Achievement Award in his honor. This award-among the Institute's most prestigious awards, recognizes outstanding contributions that have had a noteworthy impact on the standard of living and on the peace and prosperity of society. Dr. Gibson was an active supporter to both Washington State University and Stanford University which both gave him so much as a struggling student. Memorial service will be held on July 10 at 2PM at Stanford University Memorial Church.
