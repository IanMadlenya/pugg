        MILLER--Dorothy C. The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art and the Members of its International Council mourn the loss of their beloved and gentle colleague and friend, Dorothy Miller who, together with Alfred H. Barr, Jr., the Museum's founding Director, built the Museum's collection and exhibition program during its formative years. Throughout Dorothy's 35 years as a brilliant museum curator, she organized many landmark exhibitions, which recognized undiscovered talented American artists. These pioneering shows contributed greatly in building public awareness of the rich and diverse work by major artists who first emerged in the middle of the 20th Century. Although she retired from the Museum in 1969, as Curator of Museum Collections, her exuberant love of art and inspiring influence on the younger staff remain as part of her legacy. A longterm member of the Museum's International Council and Honorary Trustee of the Museum, Dorothy was first and foremost a passionate advocate for artists. We extend our deepest sympathy to her nephew, Reid White, her niece, Mrs. Edith White Danton, and her step-daughter, Jane Cahill Blumenfeld.
