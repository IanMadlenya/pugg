        RUBE-Sidney, Hazzan. The Cantors Assembly records with sorrow the passing of a revered colleague of over four decades. A wonderful cantor who quietly and gently served the spiritual needs of his Congregation Shaare Zedek, of Southfield, Michigan for over thirty years with dignity, warmth and care. His kindness, his humanity and his caring inspired us all. We extend our sympathy to his family and loved ones. May his memory abide as a blessing. Hazzan Sheldon Levin, President Hazzan Stephen J. Stein, Executive Vice President Hassan Abraham B. Shapiro, Executive Administrator
