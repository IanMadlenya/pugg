        HARRIS-Reginald. The William Morris Agency mourns the passing of its esteemed client and beloved friend, Reginald Harris, and extends our deepest sympathy to the family he loved so much-his wife Diane and his children Rachel and Darren. He was a person with deep reservoirs of love and goodness. He will be missed greatly.
