        KRAUS-Alfredo. The Metropolitan Opera deeply mourns the death of a unique artist and beloved colleague, Alfredo Kraus. His impeccable sense of style, aristocratic stage presence, and great warmth made him an ideal exponent of the lyrical roles of the Bel Canto and French repertories. Of his 134 performances of twelve roles with the Metropolitan, perhaps the most memorable were his Werther, Hoffmann, and Romeo, as well as his Edgardo in ''Lucia di Lammermoor'' and Tonio in ''La Fille du Regiment.'' But it is not only for his artistry that we will remember him, for he was a true gentleman, whose charm, kindness, and grace endeared him to all who came to know him. From his Met debut in 1966 as the Duke in ''Rigoletto'' to his last Met appearance in our April 1996 Gala honoring James Levine, he was for thirty years one of the bestloved artists in our company, and it is with great sorrow that we extend our sincere condolences to his family and friends. Joseph Volpe, General Manager James Levine, Artistic Director
