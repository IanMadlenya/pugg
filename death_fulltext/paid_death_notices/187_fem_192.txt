A devoted wife, mother and grandmother, her compassion for others was extraordinary and her tireless commitment to the many causes she supported was an inspiration. Pauline's interests were many, but her family were her jewels. Gracious and generous to all who knew her, she will be missed but never forgotten. Our thoughts and prayers always will be with her. We loved her. God rest her soul. The LeFrak family
