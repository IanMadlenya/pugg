        BETTRIDGE--William B. The Board of Trustees, staff, members and volunteers of the New York City Chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society extend our heartfelt condolences to our friend and Trustee Susan Thomases on the loss of her beloved husband, William Bettridge. He left her and their adored son Tom and daughter Shannon much too soon. Susan's exceptional devotion to Bill and her total commitment to his well being were inspirational.
