        KAMEN--Michael. A loving friend and extremely talented composer, whose scores enriched motion pictures, and who brought the joy of music to children everywhere through the Mr. Holland's Opus Foundation, which he founded with his brother John. We will miss his humor, his generosity and his kindness. Our sincerest condolences to his wife Saundra and their children, and to his father and brother. Martin Richards and The Producer Circle Co.
        KAMEN--Michael. The Alumni & Friends of LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts mourns the loss of alumnus Michael Kamen. A Grammy Awardwinning composer, Michael was a member of our advisory board and a supporter of the school and our students. We are establishing a scholarship fund in his memory.
