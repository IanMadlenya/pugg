        MOORE - Dr. James A. The Faculty and Staff of The New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center mourn the passing of our dear friend and colleague, Dr. James A. Moore. A pioneer in the field of otology, Dr. Moore became the first Director of New York-Cornell's Division of Otorhinolaryngology in 1947, and the first Chairman of the Department. Under his leadership and guidance, the Department was recognized for its clinical excellence. It became to regional referral center for micro-surgical procedures of the middle ear and made significant contributions in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the ear, nose and throat. Following his retirement in 1981, Dr. Moore retained the titles of Professor Emeritus and Honorary Otolaryngologist at New York-Cornell. He will be long remembered for his contributions to the Department and the Medical Center. Our sincere sympathies are extended to his family.  Dr. Antonio M. Gotto, Jr. M.D.  Dean  Cornell University Medical College  Dr. David B. Skinner  President  The New York Hospital  Dr. W. Shain Schley  Chairman  Dept. of Otorthinolaryngology
