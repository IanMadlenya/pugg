        COHN-Arthur. The Board of Directors, Officers and Staff of Carl Fischer, Inc., mourn he passing of our distinguished friend and colleague, Arthur Cohn. As Director of Serious Music for the firm since 1973, Arthur had an enormous impact on the growth and development of the Fischer Catalogue. As a performed and published composer, conductor, and the author of numerous books on music, his importance to the musical community cannot be overstated. We join with his many associates throughout the music world in saluting the life of this extraordinary man, and extend to his beloved wife, Lois, and the rest of his family, our deepest sympathy. Charles Abry, President Carl Fischer, Inc
