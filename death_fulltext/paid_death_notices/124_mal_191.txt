        GREENBERG-Bernard. Members of The Department of Pediatrics at Maimonides Medical Center note with regret the passing of a valued colleague. Dr. Greenberg was a force in The Department of Pediatrics as a distinguished Clinician and Teacher since his appointment in 1947. He was also active in the affairs of the medical center where from 1967 to 1969, he served as President of The Medical Staff. He had continued to contribute as Chairman of The Prestigious Memorial and Dedications Committee of the hospital until his recent demise. Dr. Greenberg was greatly respected by his patients and his peers and he will be sorely missed.
