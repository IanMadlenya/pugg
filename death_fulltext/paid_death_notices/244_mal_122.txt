        $(6$)ROTMAN--Arthur, November 29, 1926 to May 10, 2007. The death of Arthur Rotman, president emeritus of Jewish Community Centers Association, is a great loss to his family, his colleagues, and the entire JCC Movement, which he served so ably and with such dedication. After many years at local JCCs, Rotman joined JCC Association as the organization's chief professional officer in 1976. From then until his retirement in 1994, he worked tirelessly to enhance the Jewish nature of JCCs and to support the status and professionalism of Jewish communal work. His deep involvement with the Commission on Maximizing the Jewish Educational Effectiveness of JCCs transformed the JCC, making it a premier institution of Judaic engagement. His deep commitment to Jewish life and community made him a giant in the field. Our sincere condolences to his wife Anita, his children Laurie, Stephen, Mina, Carol and Labe, and eight grandchildren. Alan P. Solow, Chair Allan Finkelstein, President JCC Association
