        DICKERSON-Nancy. The members of the Board of Trustees of the Center for the Study of the Presidency mourn the passing of Nancy Dickerson, beloved wife of our former trustee, John C. Whitehead. This Center has long recognized Nancy's brilliant contributions to public policy, beginning as a reserach associate for the Sente Foreign Relations Committee in Washington. Thereafter, for more than three decades, she contributed significantly to public affairs in our nation's capital, pioneering as the first woman producer for CBS News, subsequently serving with NBC and founding her own television producing company. Every President of the United Sates from Eisenhower to the present has viewed Nancy Dickerson as a respected counselor. Washington's loss eight years ago was New York's gain when John Whitehead brought her here as his wife. She contributed so much to so many New York institutions. Her counsel, her grace, her understanding will long be remembered in our community, and we offer our condolences to John, whose friendship the Center continues to appreciate. Richard G. Kelley, Chairman R. Gordon Hoxie, Founder President Emeritus
