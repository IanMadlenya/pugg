        MARROW-Molly. September 2, 1916-May 3, 2000. Molly, like her late husband, Harry, was born in poverty. During their sixty-year marriage they achieved the American dream by making the lives of their children comfortable and privileged. Robert, Victor, Norman, Ted and their families mourn the loss of a loving parent, whose joy was found in what she could do for Harry, her children, her grandchildren and others. We will miss her and never forget her. Donations in her memory can be made to The Alex Marrow Children's Fund at 56 Rye Road, Rye, NY 10580, a charitable foundation created in memory of her beloved grandson.
