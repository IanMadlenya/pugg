        SIDMAN--David. ARMDI-American Red Magen David for Israel records with deep sorrow the loss of its beloved past National Director. For 20 years he served with dedication and devotion to the organization and Israel. He will always be remembered for assuming the responsibility for organizing and planting the seeds of 150 ARMDI chapters throughout the United States. We express our sincere condolences to his sons, Andy and Mark, and their families. They should be proud of their father's accomplishments in helping ARMDI and Magen David Adom in Israel. Robert L. Sadoff, M.D., National Chairman Mark D. Lebow, National President Benjamin Saxe, Executive Vice President
