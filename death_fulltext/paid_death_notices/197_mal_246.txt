        KOPPETT -- Leonard. The trustees, faculty, alumni and staff of Poly Prep Country Day School mourn the passing of Leonard Koppett, Class of 1940. We, along with his fans, will miss his sports writing, which earned for him a place in the Baseball Hall of Fame. He will be missed but never forgotten. We send our deepest condolences to his family.
