        GOULD-James Pearson, DSc. Geotechnical Engineer. Born October 9, 1922, Seattle, Washington. Died December 25, 1998, at his home in New York City, of lung cancer. Deeply mourned by his wife, Kristin White Gould; his son, James Edward Gould, of Greenwich, CT; his daughter, Diane Gould Peters, of Rowayton, CT, and four beloved grandchildren. In lieu of flowers, the Gould family would appreciate contributions to Cabrini Hospice.
        GOULD-James P. The partners and staff of Mueser Rutledge Consulting Engineers note with sadness the death of their retired partner, James P. Gould. His 45 year associton with the firm as an employee, partner and consultant is recognized. We will miss his superior intellect, his insightful knowledge of regional geology and its application to difficult structural and foundation problems; but most of all his good humor and lack of pomposity in his role as an advisor to clients and staff.
