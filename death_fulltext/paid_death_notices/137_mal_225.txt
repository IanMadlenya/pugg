        ALLON-Otto. It is with heartfelt sorrow that we note the passing of our dear friend and colleague, Dr. Otto Allon. Otto was of that rare breed of master surgeons who excelled brilliantly in his specialty while living life to the fullest. His friendship and sense of humor will be missed by all who had the good fortune to have known him. Our heart goes out to his wife Clara, his son Daniel, and his grandsons.
