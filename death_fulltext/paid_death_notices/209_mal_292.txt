        ROTHMAN--Shelly J. We are saddened to report the death of our member, Shelly J. Rothman, President of Project Hope Emeritus. He was a person who always had a smile on his face, and a word of encouragement for those around him. His can-do attitude about anything attempted by our Labor and Business Lodge became contagious in his company. He was always available to us, and showed a willingness to bring help in any way he could. Day in and day out, he showed the kind of motivation and leadership all of us at B'nai B'rith so much admired. But even more than the leadership position, we have always valued his close and friendly association with our membership. There is for most people, that one special individual who becomes a mentor, offering guidance, introductions, inspirations, encouragement, solace over difficult times, and most importantly, an example of success. For us, Shelly was that person. Louis L. Levine, President Martin Adelstein, First Vice President Louis Weiser, Vice President Sidney Lew, Secretary-Treasurer Warren Lew, President Project Hope Steven Levine, B'Nai B'rith International Henry Segal, Administrator Harold Wolchok, Director
