        FELTENSTEIN-Pat Liveright. On March 24, 1999, in Lake Worth, FL, aged 89. Widow of Milton, mother of John Henry King and Jeffry Howard King, grandmother of Tammy Jeanne, Heather and Jeff, Jr. She was a free spirit-courageous, outspoken, perceptive, exciting, a woman ahead of her time, never afraid to seize life and live it to the fullest. She gave as good as she got. Her artistic sensitivity and creativity were of the highest order. Perhaps the finest portrait photographer of her time, she possessed the uncommon power to illuminate a person's soul on film. As many said, she was a very special person. Her passing dims the lives of her family and friends, but she will always remain in our memory with love.
