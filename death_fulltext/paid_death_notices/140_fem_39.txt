        SCHURGIN-Audrey. It is with profound sorrow that we mourn the loss of our beloved Audrey Schurgin, former General Studies Principal. With her unique gift of recognizing individual strengths, her loving and nurturing encouragement, and her open arms and warm smile, she touched the lives of the students, faculty and entire SAR family and set the tone for what is truly the spirit of SAR. Loved by all who knew her, Audrey will be sorely missed. Our heartfelt condolences to her adoring husband, sons, father and entire family. May she always watch over her ''Bubalas'' and may her memory be a blessing for us all. The SAR Academy Parent Teacher Council
        SCHURGIN-Audrey. Beloved cousin, dearest friend, lovely lady. You will be missed. Marion and Sam Maizes
