        FRIEDLANDER--Toby. Cherished daughter of Nat and Faye Friedlander, dear friend to many, who mourn her loss. Toby died on Wednesday evening, January 5, peacefully, with dignity, surrounded with love. Heroically she challenged many things in life--a disciplined neo-natal nurse, a talented designer and finally in her own battle with lung cancer. She will be missed but not forgotten. Memorial service on Friday, January 7, at 11 A.M., Sherman's Chapel, 1283 Coney Island Avenue, Brooklyn.
        FRIEDLANDER--Toby. Mommy, I love you. Maggie
