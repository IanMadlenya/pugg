        LEWIS-Aubrey. The Board of Commissioners and the employees of The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey mourn the passing of Aubrey C. Lewis, who served as a distinguished member of the Board from 1997 to 1999. Commissioner Lewis gave freely of his time and talent in service to the Port Authority and the people of the New York-New Jersey region, and we wish to express our heartfelt appreciation for the time he spent on the Board. Our deepest sympathies go to his wife, Annie, his five children and eleven grandchildren.
