        MARIN-Dragan. We mourn the loss of our ''Kum,'' friend and supporter. His optimistic and positive attitude always encouraged us in our work. We will miss his warm personality and his friendship. Deepest sympathies extended to his family. Memory Eternal. St. Sava Restoration and Development Committee
