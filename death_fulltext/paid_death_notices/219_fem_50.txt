        STIEBER BERNSTEIN--Evelyn. The American Friends of The Hebrew University (AFHU) and The Hebrew University of Jerusalem express profound sadness over the passing of our treasured friend, Evelyn Stieber Bernstein. A Benefactor of The Hebrew University and recipient of an honorary fellowship, Evelyn displayed a lifelong commitment to Israel, the Jewish people and to the cause of higher education. Over three decades, her devotion to Hebrew University faculty and students took many forms. Evelyn served on the Board of Governors and as an honorary vice president of AFHU, and established the Otto Stieber Chair in Cancer Research in memory of her beloved first husband. Evelyn and Sol Bernstein perpetuated these efforts and worked tirelessly in support of AFHU's mission as co-chairs of Florida's Hollywood/Hallandale Chapter. Prized for her personal warmth as well as for her humanitarianism, Evelyn created a lasting legacy. We extend our deepest condolences to Evelyn's daughters Janice, Elaine and Fran, her grandchildren, and greatgrandchildren. AFHU Ira Lee Sorkin, President Keith L. Sachs, Chairman of the Board Peter T. Willner, National Executive Director The Hebrew University of Jerusalem Menachem Magidor, President
