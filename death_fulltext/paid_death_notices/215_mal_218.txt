        NEWFIELD--Jack. The staff and members of 1199SEIU mourn the loss of a beloved friend and ally whose voice, pure and unwavering, was the voice of the people. Among Jack's passionate causes was the fight for home health care workers for a living wage. In columns in our monthly magazine, his topics ranged from rats and lead poisoning in New York City slums to corporate criminals and Washington chicken hawks. Jack believed the true calling of a journalist is to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable. His death is a personal tragedy for those of us who knew him and a major loss for those whose suffering he gave voice to. Our deepest condolences to his loving wife, Janie and his beloved children, Rebecca and Joey. Dennis Rivera, President George Gresham, Secretary/Treasurer 1199SEIU New York's Health & Human Service Union

Our deepest condolences to his wife and family. Jennifer J. Raab, President Hunter College
