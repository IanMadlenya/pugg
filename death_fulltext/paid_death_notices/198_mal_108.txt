        MANDEL--Lenard. Elected to the Board five years ago, Lenard Mandell was a significant presence whose brilliance and measured reason brought clarity and understanding to each issue he met. His guidance always came with wisdom and a wry wit. We shall always remember his dedication to the organization's mission of bringing a finely tuned musical experience to the world. Heartfelt thoughts go to children Richard and Carol, brother Robert and five grandchildren. Board of Trustees New York Youth Symphony Leslie J.
