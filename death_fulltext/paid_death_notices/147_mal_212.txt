        SCHWARZ-Paul. Born June 1, 1911, originally from Amsterdam. Beloved husband and companion of Suzy. Internationally known jeweler (associated with the House of Harry Winston), passed away April 13 in Miami, FL. after a long and courageous struggle with illness. Gentle, kind and full of humor, his urbane charm and wit made him many friends. He is sorely missed by his wife of 32 years, Suzy & the entire Thevenin family, notably Charles and Sallie of Vevey; Louis, Nicole and Sophie of Sydney; James and Paul and Jean of Paris; also his nephew Harry Mulisch of Amsterdam; Jeanette, Kim, Amber & Milagros. May his soul rest in peace.
