        MILLGRAM-Rabbi Abraham Ezra. We record with sorrow the passing of our beloved colleague, age 96. Ordained in 1927, he served congregations in Wilmington, DE., and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and then as Hillel Director at the University of Minnesota. In 1945, Rabbi Millgram became Educational Director of United Synagogue, a position from which he retired in 1961 and made aliyah to Israel. He is the author of ''Jewish Worship,'' ''An Anthology of Medieval Hebrew Literature'' and ''Sabbath, The Day of Delight''. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his son, our colleague Rabbi Hillel I. Millgram. Rabbi David L. Lieber, President Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Exec VP The Rabbinical Assembly
