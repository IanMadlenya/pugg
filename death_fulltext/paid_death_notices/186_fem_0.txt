        FREED-Nancy Lee. Born in New York City on December 11, 1923, died peacefully on Friday, June 28, 2002, in the company of her son Carl Freed, her daughter Jennifer Freed and her partner Rendy Freedman, her sister Jane Kalmus, nephew John Kalmus, her cousin Marie Patrick and her husband Michael Lofthus. She is also survived by her son Andrew Sutton, her niece Suzi Kalmus, her daughter-in-law Jennifer Freed, her sister-in-law Edith Penzner, and five grandchildren. Passionate wife of the late Bert Freed, she was a truly gracious and elegant woman. She touched the lives of so many with her zest for life and charisma, her strength and sensitivity, tough determination, wonderful sense of humor, endless generosity and compassion, and her spontaneous warmth and affection. Nancy was a lifelong activist in New York and California. Long a public relations consultant, she was a tireless and dedicated volunteer for the Venice Family Clinic and the Police Activities League. She was also tremendously proud of the accomplishments of OPICA, an adult day service and counseling center in Los Angeles, and treasured the friendships that developed over the years. She will be deeply missed by all who knew her. A memorial service will be held on Tuesday, July 2, 2002, at 11:00 a.m. at Leo Baeck Temple in Brentwood, Los Angeles, California. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Family Therapy Institute for the Academy of Healing Arts for Teens, 23 West Mission, Santa Barbara, California 93101.
