        LERNER-Evelyn. On November 30th, 2000. Beloved wife, mother, sister, aunt, friend. ''Who can find a virtuous woman? For her price is far above rubies...Strength and honour are her clothing...She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness...Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.''
