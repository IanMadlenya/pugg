        KLEIN--Nancy H. On June 4, 2005. Beloved wife of Harold, daughter of Yetta and Jonas, sister of Helen and Stanley, Sandy, Audrey and Bob, aunt and dear friend, died peacefully at home after a long illness. Nancy's wisdom, strength and spirit enriched our lives. Her innate taste and style propelled a dazzling creative career at Barneys New York, Gump's San Francisco and Tiffany & Co. where she set the standard for a generation of design and merchandising. Nancy created a heaven on earth by giving us the gift of beautiful, wonderful memories. A memorial gathering will be planned. Family and friends will be informed about time and place.
