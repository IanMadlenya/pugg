        ROGGEMANN - Lynn. Wo men's League for Israel mourns the untimely death of our beloved Lynn Roggemann. A third generation Women's Leaguer, she served in every capacity, from chapter to national officer. She was the Metropolitan Region's president. We will miss her warmth, her intelligence and her common sense. She was a good, loyal friend, a hard worker, conscientious and caring, devoted to Israel and to all who needed her. Our hearts go out to her husband Dennis; her children Mark, Florence and Ellen; grandchild Amber; Howard and Robin; the Bier family and dear friends. We loved her and we grieve for her. Harriet Lainer, National Pres. Women's League for Israel
