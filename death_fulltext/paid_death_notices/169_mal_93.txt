        OBERWAGER-Karl. American Friends of The Hebrew University and The Hebrew University of Jerusalem are deeply saddened by the passing of our dear friend and Benefactor Karl Oberwager on February 4, 2001, shortly after his 100th birthday. Together with Susie, his beloved wife of 53 years, the Oberwagers established the Philipp Rothbart and Helene Gottheil Rothbart Endowment Fund in honor of Susie's parents, to provide scholarships and student aid at the Hebrew University. In May 2000 they traveled to Jerusalem to participate in the Benefactors dedication ceremony on the Mount Scopus Campus where their generous commitment was recognized. It was Karl's 20th visit to Israel and a true highpoint in an extraordinary life that began with his birth in Austria. Karl barely survived six years in the coalmines of Siberia during WW II. He met and married Susie in Romania and the couple eventually immigrated to the United States, where Karl rose from busboy to popular restaurant owner of the Parkway in New York City. The couple worked together until Karl's retirement in 1980. Karl will be remembered as a gracious human being and a true gentleman. He will be mourned and missed by all who knew him. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife Susie and the entire family.
