        POLLACK-Irwin ''Irv.'' 77, of Seattle, died October 16 of heart failure. He was Business Manager at Yale University, graduate of CCNY, a progressive activist. He will be sorely missed. We might have had him longer if he were able to stop smoking. He is survived by his son Jordan of Port Townsend, WA, sister Miriam Weintraub of NYC, ex-wife Clarice of New Haven, niece Sherry Mestel of Brooklyn NY, grandnieces and devoted friends Lisa Morrow and Scott McClay of Seattle.
