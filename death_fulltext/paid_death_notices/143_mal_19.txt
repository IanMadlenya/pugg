        FASCELL-Dante. The officers, members and staff of The American Jewish Committee mourn the passing of an extraordinary public servant. Tireless defender of human dignity and human rights, Congressman Fascell was especially active in defense of the USIsrael partnership, the yearning for freedom in the communist world, the quest of Soviet Jews to emigrate to the West, and the pursuit of social justice during his distinguished 37-year career in the House of Representatives. We express our heartfelt condolences to Congressman Fascell's grieving family. We shall always cherish the legacy of his manifold achievements-to which we paid tribute when we presented him with our Congressional Leadership Award in 1989-and the memory of his friendship. Bruce M. Ramer, President David A. Harris, Exec Dir. The American Jewish Committee
