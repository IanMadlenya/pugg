        LANDMAN--Amos, of New York and West Cornwall, CT, died Sunday morning of cancer at age 90. A journalist, public relations executive and World War II veteran, he was a reporter for the Daily Mirror and PM and a radio and newspaper correspondent in China from 1948 to '50. He retired in 1985 as Senior Vice President of Ruder & Finn. Born in Philadelphia and educated at Townsend Harris High School and Brown University. He will be remembered for decency, integrity and loyalty, having chosen to endure the blacklist in the 1950s rather than betray his friends. He is survived by his wife of nearly 60 years, Lynn, his children, Jonathan (Bonnie) and Margot, his grandchildren, Rachel and Aaron, and his sister Louise, all of whom will cherish his memory forever. He made us all laugh. Service 4:30 pm, today, Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th St. In lieu of flowers, please make a contribution to Doctors Without Borders or the Central Park Conservancy.
