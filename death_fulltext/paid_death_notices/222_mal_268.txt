        MARGOLIN--Joel A. On July 23 in New York at the age of 71. A respected psychoanalyst. He was loved by family and friends. Joel was a gifted man. One of his greatest gifts was his ability to understand you, those whom he helped to understand themselves, their feelings and the world around them. Through his music and the melodies he wrote, he made the words come alive. Through his poetry, Joel could make us think about who we are: In the hemorrhaged torn out night of a place in a place of light in the dreams of the hallways that cross our sleep is the hemorrhaged torn out night of a place in a place of light in that once complete place called mind by Joel Margolin-June 1972 Service Tuesday, 11:30AM, at ''The Riverside'', 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue.
