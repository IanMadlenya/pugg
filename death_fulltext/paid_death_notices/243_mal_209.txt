        HAUGEN--John C. The directors and staff of the American Parkinson Disease Association mourn the loss of our friend and treasurer of seven years. John was a quiet man of charity, compassion and faith, who served with fervor yet without flourish. We will miss him deeply, as will the many people whose lives he touched, and extend our sincerest condolences to Sophia, John Jr., Katryn, Mary Virginia and his entire family including Mattingly. Vincent N. Gattullo, President Joel Gerstel, Executive Director
