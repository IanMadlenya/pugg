        GERSH-Max. 94, died peacefully at home in Boynton Beach, FL, on December 7, 2002. We celebrate an extraordinary man who had a passionate love affair with life. Loving husband of Barbara. Devoted father to Damon, David, Gerald and Gretchen. Doting grandfather and a steady friend to many, Max lived a long, interesting and satisfying life. A lifelong entrepreneur, visionary, leader and founder of MAXONS, Max was the original ''master of disaster,'' pioneering an industry devoted to helping people recover from disasters. A man for all seasons, Max brought warmth, vitality, humor and optimism to his every encounter and remained buoyant even through stormy times. We will all miss his love, stories, jokes and bad puns, all conveyed with his radiant smile and a twinkle in his eye.
