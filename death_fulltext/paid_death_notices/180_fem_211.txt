        SUSSMAN-Ilene. Along with the VIs parents at City and Country School, we are deeply saddened by the passing of our cherished friend Ilene. The times we shared as mothers and friends will always remind us of what a wonderful, inspiring woman she was. Her graciousness and spirit are enduring. Our thoughts are with Brian and Rhy, and the Sussman and Kelly families. ''How could we not.'' Simone Weissman, Peter Levitt Beth and Alf Blitzer
