        BETHELL--Sr. Annunciata, O.S.U., 90. The President and Board of Trustees of Montefiore Medical Center and the entire Montefiore community are deeply saddened by the death of longtime Board member, Montefiore volunteer and community spirit and activist for the young and the elderly, Sr. Annunciata Bethell, O.S.U. A lifelong resident of the Bronx, Sr. Annunciata spent decades teaching the borough's young, and then, spent over forty years as a tireless advocate for the senior citizens of the Bronx. Clergywoman and social worker, Sr. Annunciata began her association with Montefiore as a member of the Moses Division Community Advisory Board, becoming a constant presence in the Emergency Department and on the inpatient units, always checking on the care being given to ''her'' seniors, becoming a confidante and close friend to many. In 1980, she was asked to join the Board of Trustees where she remained until her passing this weekend. Sr. Annunciata never wavered in her devotion to her community, and her seniors. Our deepest and heartfelt condolences are extended to Sr. Annunciata's entire family in this time of their, and our, great loss. Spencer Foreman, M.D. President Jay B. Langner, Chairman Board of Trustees Montefiore Medical Center
