        DOBO-Margaret Louise-''Bita'' to her family and friends passed away peacefully on April 1st, from complications following surgery. Bita was born on June 27, 1916 in New York City, the daughter of the preeminent dermatologist, Marion Baldur Sulzberger, M.D., and Edna Lowenstein Benedictus. She was raised by her mother in France, during which time she developed a life-long affection for its people and culture. After learning English during a stay in England, she returned to her beloved New York City before World War II. It was here that she met the love of her life, Francis (Frank) Dobo. They were married on July 17, 1942. Settling down together on East 86th Street, Bita devoted her energies to the responsibilities of a caring and supportive mother, in addition to becoming the public face of the Council on Foreign Relations. As receptionist and switchboard operator, her sensitivity and linguistic skills soon became indispensable to the noted institution, where she welcomed both members and distinguished world visitors, for over a quarter-century. Bita's continuing compassion for those less fortunate and for all God's four-legged creatures will be missed by all who knew her during her long, loving life. Her passing leaves this publication less one of its most devoted readers and an enduring sadness felt by her son, Michael of Norfolk, Connecticut and by all she touched. Services are pending.
