        NOLAN--Philip T. December 24, 2004. Retired Verizon, CWA 1101, AFL-CIO member, veteran of the US Air Force. Loving husband of 50 years to Margaret, wonderful father of Catherine, a New York State Assemblywoman, Margaret, a registered nurse practitioner, and Philip, a retired NYC detective. Devoted grandfather of Nolan, Erin, Helen, Kelly and Nicholas. A man of tremendous accomplishment and energy. It would be hard to say what he loved best, a good laugh or a fair fight. A wake to celebrate his life will be held at George Werst Funeral Home in Glendale, Queens, on Tuesday, December 28, 2004. Donations can be made to any charity. Philip will be very missed by all who knew him. Rest in peace.
