        MOUNT-Lester A., MD. Members of the Department of Neurological Surgery at the Neurological Institute of New York, Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center note with sadness the death of Lester A. Mount. Dr. Mount spent his entire career at the Neurological Institute and was Acting Director of the Department of Neurological Surgery from 1972 to 1973. He was widely recognized as a master neurosurgeon, he was meticulous and bold and was a pioneer in the management of subarachnoid hemorrhage and intracranial aneurysms. He also served Project Hope as chief of neurosurgery and performed service for that organization in many countries. A kind and dignified gentleman, he was a superb teacher and scholar devoted to the Neurological Institute and the Medical Center. He was an advisor and friend to a multitude of medical students, trainees in neurosurgery and his colleagues. We extend deep condolences to his family. Robert A. Solomon, M.D. Chairman and Director Neurological Surgery New York Presbyterian Hospital Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center
