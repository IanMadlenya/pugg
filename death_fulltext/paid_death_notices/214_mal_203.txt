        COLEMAN--Cy. The House of Steinway & Sons notes with profound sorrow the untimely passing of its beloved friend, the renowned American composer and pianist Cy Coleman, on November 18, 2004 in New York City at the age of 75. Mr. Coleman was a deeply valued member of our Steinway Artist family for most of his life. An accomplished and classically trained pianist who made his Carnegie Hall debut at the age of 7, Cy Coleman's musical journey led him to the world of jazz and, of course, to the Great White Way. He was one of this country's greatest and most honored songwriters, with such immortal standards as ''Witchcraft'', ''The Best is Yet to Come'', ''Big Spender'', ''I've Got Your Number'', and ''Hey, Look Me Over'' to his credit. His Broadway scores included ''Sweet Charity'', ''City of Angels'', ''The Will Rogers Follies'', ''On the Twentieth Century'', ''I Love My Wife'' and ''The Life'', to name but a few. Cy Coleman was always at home at the Steinway, and to hear him play was a real joy and, for us, inspiring. Though our lives have been forever enriched by his music, his generous and jaunty persona will be sorely missed by us all. To Shelby and Lilly Cye, we extend our love and our heartfeld condolences. Bruce A. Stevens, President Peter B. Goodrich, V.P. Worldwide Concert and Artist Activities
