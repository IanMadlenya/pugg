        KATES--David. The New York Philharmonic notes with sadness the death, on January 9th, of David Kates, 93, a violist with the Philharmonic from 1933-1976. Mr. Kates first played with the Philharmonic in 1930 at The Lewisohn Stadium Concerts, and joined the St. Louis Symphony in 1932. He was appointed to the Philharmonic by Arturo Toscanini the following year. Mr. Kates was the father of the cellist Stephen Kates, who died last year.
