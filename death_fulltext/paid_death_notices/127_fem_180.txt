        ELDRIDGE - Ruth Williamson. Died August 27, 1997, at age 92, in Gwynedd, PA. She and her late husband were early residents of Foulkeways, the first Quaker retirement community. She was graduated from Schoharie High School, age 16, and Albany School of Nursing, age 20. She was a nurse with the Henry Street Settlement House on NYC's lower eastside at the time of her marriage to Lewis A. Eldridge Jr., in 1928. The defining period in her life covered the next three years in Berlin, Germany. There she heard Richard Strauss conduct ''Solome,'' Furtwangler conducting Beethoven and Schnabel playing Schubert and Mozart. This lead to a life-long love of classical music and the German people. On return to Great Neck, NY, she studied voice with Alda Astori and later in Rensselaerville, NY, organized summer concerts. Deeply disturbed by the Second World War, she was lead to the Quaker faith. She was secretary of the New York Yearly Meeting, and the library at the Albany Friends Meeting was named in her honor. Survivors include a son Roswell Eldridge of Rensselaerville, NY, eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. Her husband died in 1977, and her oldest son, Lewis A. Eldridge III, of Oyster Bay, NY, died in 1982. A memorial service will take place in September in Rensselaerville, NY. Contributions to American Friends Service Committee, Philadelphia, and the Metropolitan Opera.
