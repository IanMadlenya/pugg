        GOLDSTEIN-Murray. Grandpa, my hero, just like John Wayne. The things you left me with have made me who I am today. I love you and am proud to be your grandson. Love, Joshua
        GOLDSTEIN-Murray. A gracious, loving and talented gentleman. Deeply devoted to his partner and life mate Gladys and to his three sons, their wives and his adoring six grandchildren. He cared so very much about so very many others who benefited by his active concern and efforts in their behalf. We were privileged to be part of his extended family and will deeply miss him. Jerry, Maxine and Tad Belson
