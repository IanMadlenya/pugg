        SLOTKIN-Babette Okin. It is with great sorrow that the Board of Directors and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Babette Okin Slotkin, a dedicated friend to the Jewish community. Through her good work, she supported the world of our services and embodied the compassion of our mission. Our deepest sympathies go to her husband, Robert, her sons, Donald, Mitchell, Curt and Todd, her many grandchildren, and the entire family. May all who benefited from her kindness and wisdom be consoled among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair James S. Tisch, President Stephen D. Solender, Exec V.P.
