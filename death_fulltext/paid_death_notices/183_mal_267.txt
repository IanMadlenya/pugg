        LIPKIN-Leonard, from Clifton, NJ. With great sadness, we mourn Lenny's death on April 20th, at a young 76 years of age. Condolences to his devoted wife Lorraine, who worked tirelessly these past few months to help relieve his painful existence caused by his cancer, and to his son Peter and wife Randi and grandchildren Eric and Katie, who did their utmost to make him happy. The world has lost a loving, compassionate, gracious individual with a wonderful sense of humor, though we will all miss him greatly. He will not be forgotten because we will talk about him continuously. The Families of the Dells, Chases, Kudlers and Glassers
