        LEVINSON-Sol R. I am deeply saddened by the passing of my friend, my mentor, & my partner. His wits, compassion, and loyal support will always be remembered. The lesson he taught me long ago will always be part of my life. My heartfelt sympathy to his wife, Belle, his daughter, Marcia, and Bonnie, and his grandchildren. Charles Uribe
