        FRIEDMAN--Clifford J. 82, of Kent, CT. Died January 6, 2006, while doing what he loved most, winning a tennis tiebreaker. Mr. Friedman was born May 15, 1923. He had been a full-time resident of Kent since 2000, having been a weekend resident since 1981 while living in Manhattan. Mr. Friedman retired from his lifelong profession as a stockbroker in 1988 and became an arbitrator for the American Arbitration Association, the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. He was on the Board of the Brooklyn College Foundation, serving in a variety of positions during his 40-year tenure. He was awarded the Brooklyn College Presidential Medal in 1981 and named a Life Trustee in 1985. Mr Friedman received his B.A. from Brooklyn College in 1948 and a J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1951, his education having been interrupted by a three-year stint in the Armed Forces during World War II. In addition to being an avid tennis player, he was a devoted New York Jets fan and enjoyed stamp collecting, playing bridge, traveling, reading and playing with his beloved dog, Miss Scottie. Mr. Friedman is survived by his adored wife of 55 years, Frances, of Kent, two sons and daughters-in-law, Ken and Sari of Syosset, NY, and Jeff and Valerie of Orlando, FL, and three granddaughters, Andrea, Deborah and Alexandra.
