        SCHINDLER--Mark, on April 24, 2007. Loving companion and best friend. He brought laughter and joy to all he met. His strength of character, integrity and devotion were unsurpassed. His uncanny memory for trivia and all sorts of facts was unrivaled. Our every day together will be a treasured memory. Always , Your Barbara
