        HALPERN--Nathan L. The Board of Trustees and staff of the Central Park Conservancy note with deep sadness the passing of Nathan L. Halpern, a member of the Board from 1984 to 1995, and esteemed counsel and Life Trustee from 1995 to present. During his tenure with the Conservancy, and throughout its formative years, Nathan's strong leadership and generosity, provided a solid foundation for Central Park's renaissance. Today, millions of New Yorkers and visitors from around the world enjoy the fruits of his commitment to the treasure that is Central Park. The progress made in revitalizing the Park will stand as a lasting tribute to a special man. We extend our sympathies to his family and friends. The Board of Trustees of the Central Park Conservancy
