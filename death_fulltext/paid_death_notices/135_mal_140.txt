Beloved husband of the late Charlotte Gerson, beloved father of Elaine and Bernard Dov Troy and Lenore and Irwin Gerson. Proud grandfather & great grandfather. A great Hebraist and Ba-al Koreh, whose devotion to Jewish life and learning will continue to inspire his family and all those who lives he touched.
