        PITOFSKY-Lynne (nee Mary Linn Beller). April 13, 2000 at Greenwich Hospital, CT. Lynne was the essence of goodness and sweetness. She was the most devoted, loving, caring wife, mother, daughter, ''nonni'' and friend. Her heart was full of love for so many people. One of her legacies was that she got great joy in bringing happiness to other people. She valued the happiness of the people she loved above her own. She had a joy of life that was unique. She saw each day as an adventure, filled with great promise and joy. Her bubbly effervescence was infectious. She entered a room with a sense of fun and exuberance. She lit up the lives of all the people she ever touched. She was such a sensitive person that, in her entire life, she never intentionally, every wanted to do or say anything that would hurt another person. We shared a love that we called ''our secret''. We felt that no other person could understand that two people could love so completely. She was a success at everything she did in her life. She enjoyed every stage of her life. She was a very successful actress, tennis player, real estate agent, but her greatest accomplishment was that she was the most wonderful, loving and devoted wife and mother. She leaves behind three wonderful sons who she poured love into and who will carry her in their hearts forever. I have been blessed to be able to share my life with someone who has brought me more happiness than I ever knew could exist. She loved her three wonderful grandchildren with all her heart. She only regretted that she wouldn't be here to share their lives. She was so thankful that her sons' wives became such wonderful, loving daughters. The moral of her life was to give and receive love freely and to make the most of every day as she did-Lynne, I love you, my wonderful soulmate.
        PITOFSKY-Mary Linn. To a dear and precious daughter who enriched my life in every way, I love and miss you. Rest in peace, darling. Mother, Helen Beller
