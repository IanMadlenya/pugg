        KATCHEN-Harry, Rabbi. Age 91. We record with sorrow the passing of our beloved colleague. Following ordination, he was rabbi of Beth El in Allentown, PA and until his retirement, he served in Outreach and Community Education for the Jewish Theological Seminary. After his retirement, he was High Holiday coordinator for The Rabbinical Assembly. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife Selma, children Alan and Roberta, and to all who were touched through his rabbinate. Rabbi Seymour L. Essrog, President Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Exec. VP The Rabbinical Assembly
