        CROW--Elizabeth. The Board of Trustees, staff and volunteers of the March of Dimes mourn the death of our esteemed longtime volunteer Elizabeth Crow. Elizabeth served on the March of Dimes National Communications Advisory Council for 20 years, many of them as chair, helping to educate journalists and consumers on maternal and infant health issues. She was a member of the National Board of Trustees since 1996, serving as Vice Chair of the Program and Communications Committee and a member of the Nominating Committee. Elizabeth's dedication to our mission to save babies from prematurity and birth defects, and her wisdom and guidance were incalculable and will be greatly missed. James E. Sproull, Jr., Esq. Chairman of the Board of Trustees Jennifer L. Howse, Ph.D., President
