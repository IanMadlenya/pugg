        LEEDS-Sylvia. The Board of Trustees, Family Association, staff and consumers of YAI/National Institute for People with Disabilities notes with great sadness the passing of Sylvia Leeds. For over three decades she was a passionate and compassionate advocate for the establishment of services for individuals with developmental disabilities. As the President of the YAI Family Association for 25 years, she counseled family members, offered friendship, support, inspiration and hope. She will be greatly missed. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to her husband Charles, her son Theodore and to her entire family. Marcella Fava, Chairman Dr. Paul H. Levitz, Vice Chairman Board of Trustees Dr. Joel M.
