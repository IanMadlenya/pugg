        WOLF--Henry. One of the foremost graphic designers of the Twentieth Century, died at his home in Manhattan on February 14, 2005. He was seventy-nine years old. Born in 1925 in Vienna, Henry studied art in Austria and France, before arriving in the United States in 1941. After serving in the U.S. Army during World War II, he returned to New York City where he became the art director of Esquire Magazine in 1952. In 1958, he left Esquire to succeed Alexey Brodovitch as the art director of Harper's Bazaar. Henry was also the art director of Show Magazine and at McCann-Erickson. In 1958 he became Executive Vice President/Creative Director of The Trahey/ Wolf Agency. From 1971 until now Henry worked as a designer and photographer. He taught at Cooper Union, The School of Visual Arts, and Parsons School of Design. During the course of a long and illustrious career, Henry was the recipient of awards from The Society of Illustrators, The Art Directors Club of New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Los Angeles, as well as the recipient of medals from The AIGA, and The Society of Publications. In 1980, Henry was inducted into The Art Directors Hall of Fame, and into The Royal Society of Arts. Henry is survived by his sister, Joan Slawson, of Manhattan. Throughout a long life, Henry was steadfast in his love of girls, cars, painting and photography, and in his distaste for computers and cell phones. We will miss him very much. The funeral service will be held at The Plaza Community Chapel, 630 Amsterdam Avenue, on Thursday, February 17, 2005 at 1 P.M. No flowers please.
