Adored aunt of Joel and Alice Winter and Kenneth and Mary Winter. Best friend of Norma Francis. She was associated for forty-five years (three generations) as a dedicated and capable bookkeeper and office manager for the Friedland-Lashin families, the Fraternal Clubhouse and the Garth Organization. We will remember Alice for her warmth, integrity, dependability and caring nature. We will so miss her friendship and her ready and easy smile. She was truly part of our family.
