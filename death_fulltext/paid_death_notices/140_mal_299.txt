        KAPLAN-Will. Died on September 23 after a two and a half month struggle following heart surgery on July 10. He was 89 years of age. Survivors include his wife of almost 20 years, Evelyn Rypins Kaplan and his nieces and nephews: Connie and Jules Kay, Charlotte and Paul Schwartz, Gladys and Leonard Davitch, Rosalind and Marty Rodman, Sara and Don Nelson. We are all very sad. At Will's request he will cremated and the memorial will be in the hearts of his survivors.
