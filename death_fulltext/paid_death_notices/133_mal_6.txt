        GOLDBERG-Rabbi Julius. The Plainview Jewish Center deeply mourns the loss of its Rabbi Emeritus, who served the congregation faithfully for four decades. As senior rabbi, he built a small new synagogue, Plainview's first, into a large, vibrant institution. His wisdom, vision, courage and activism were crucial in establishing Jewish life in Plainview on a firm foundation. Our heartfelt condolences are extended to the bereaved family: Bette, his wife and our Rebbetzin; Rabbi Mordechai (Jill), Dr. Harry (Maureen) and Rachel, his children; Chana, Yitzchak, Ephraim, Ruchama, Joshua, and Benjamin; his grandchildren; his brothers, Dr. David and Sam and his sister, Etta, and their families. Services at Plainview Jewish Center, 95 Floral Drive, Plainview, LI, on Monday, February 2, at 12 noon. Rabbi Moses A. Birnbaum Cantor Morris Wolk Jeffrey Rosen, President
