        TOPF-GIBSON-Nancy. Born October 29, 1942. Died September 2, 1998. Nancy Topf-Gibson was a passenger on Swissair Flight 111 which was lost in the Atlantic Ocean with all passengers and crew while attempting an emergency landing near Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Nancy was a master teacher, dancer, and choreographer. As the innovator of Topf Technique, she created a natural developmental approach to movement using kinetic imaging and release and alignment principles. Nancy's technique of neuromuscular education re-patterns inhibited movement, develops creative freedom and heals chronic injuries. Working with professional dancers and many students Nancy strove to center each person's emotional, spiritual, and physical body. Nancy taught throughout the United States and internationally, and was en route to teach in Geneva. Nancy is survived by her husband, composer/ musician Jon Gibson of New York City; her son, Jeremy Gibson, a college student; her mother, Celia Topf Straus of Lauderhill, FL; by her sisters and their husbands, Bobbi and Robert H. Straus, Peggy and Murray Schwartz, Margie J. Topf & Stuart Rose; and numerous nieces and nephews. A Memorial Concert is being planned for early December in New York City. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to a fund established in support of her surviving family and sent to: Nancy Topf Memorial Fund, C/O Lynne Linehan, Vice President, The Cambridge Trust Company, 494 Boston Post Road, Weston, MA. 02493.
