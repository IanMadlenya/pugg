        DOLAN--William J. The faculty and staff of the Department of Cell Biology at New York University School of Medicine express their deep sadness on the death of their dear friend and distinguished colleague, William J. Dolan, Ph.D., who was a member of the Department from 1972 until his retirement in 2003. Throughout the course of his career, Dr. Dolan was an inexhaustible source of expert knowledge in Cell Biology, Immunology and Biochemistry. His contributions to the research and teaching efforts of the Department were highly valued by faculty and students, and he will be always remembered for his kindness, warmth and generosity. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to all of Dr. Dolan's family. David D. Sabatini, M.D., Ph.D. Frederick L. Ehrman Professor and Chairman, Department of Cell Biology, NYU School of Medicine
