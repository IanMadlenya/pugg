        SCHONFELD-Hildegard. Beloved wife of Sidney, mother of Vicki, Gary, Liz and Victor; adored grandmother of Jared, Matthew, Remi, Sam and Zachary; and devoted sister of Marianne. A gracious, charming, dignified, proud and unassuming lady, she found joy and purpose in helping others. A truly modern, forward-looking woman, she embraced traditional values. Cherished wife of over 50 years, she was inexhaustibly dedicated to Sid's well-being. Above all else, she was the most caring, affectionate and thoughtful mother and grandmother possible. She never missed an opportunity to full our lives with joy, security, attention and unqualified love. Hilde was extraordinarily charitable and always giving of herself-especially to the Cultural Arts Program at the JCC on the Palisades; The Arnold P. Gold Foundation; and the Jewish Home and Rehabilitation Center. Her curiosity and love of learning were boundless-whether she was collecting Chinese snuffbottles, doing Ikebana flower arrangements, or coaching computer with her Seniornet buddies. We will cherish her memory forever. Funeral services will be held on Wednesday, March 22, 2000 at 10:00AM, Temple Emanuel-El, 147 Tenafly Rd., Englewood, NJ. Donations may be made in her memory to The Arnold P. Gold Foundation, 260 Lincoln St., Englewood, NJ 07631; Gilda's Club, 575 Main St., Hackensack, NJ 07601; or The Schonfeld Cultural Endowment Foundation, JCC on the Palisades, 411 East Clinton Ave., Tenafly, NJ 07670.
