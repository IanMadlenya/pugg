        RAMOS-Harry. With our deepest gratitude and most profound sadness we mourn for Harry, who is tragically missing since September 11, 2001, last seen in 1 WTC while trying to help our beloved Victor from the building. We are heartbroken at this terrible loss and send our deepest condolences to Harry's wife, Migdalia, his two sons, and all his family and friends. Harry is a true hero, selfless, kind and loving, and we will forever celebrate his life, mourn for him, pray for him, and hold him in our hearts.
