        BRINKMAN--Richard Gene, age 80, died in Vero Beach, FL, on January 22. A 1951 graduate of Indiana University, Dick retired in 1989 as the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Texaco. He was the first person at the company to hold that position and ''worked financial wizardry,'' in the words of a 1988 Wall Street Journal article, to keep Texaco liquid during a legal battle with Pennzoil Company. He worked at Texaco for 33 years, after working for the Bendix Aviation Corp. as a traveling auditor. He also served in three branches of the military. He served on an advisory board of the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. from 1977-1991, had been on the Dean's Advisory Council at Indiana University's Kelley School of Business since 1985, and was on the board of directors of White Plains Hospital Center from 1981-1994. A native of La Porte, IN, he was preceded in death by his wife of 29 years, Audrey. He is survived by his wife of three years, Marilyn Corl Brinkman of Vero Beach, his daughter Lisa Brinkman Jensen of Media, PA, his sister Gloria Moon of Salome, AA, and three granddaughters, Audrey, Elisabeth and Sarah. Donations can be made to Indiana University's Kelley School of Business, care of Tom Bewley, at tbewley@indiana.edu, or 1275 E. Tenth Street, Bloomington, Ind., 47405.
