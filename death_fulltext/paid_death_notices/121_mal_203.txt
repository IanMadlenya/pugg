        OLSON-Eric E. Passed away on February 14, 1997, after a valiant battle against AIDS. His sense of humor, his beautiful smile and his sense of freedom will always live inside of us. He leaves behind a large family in Nebraska and many friends all over the world. We love you Eric. Rest in peace.
