        TRIGOR--Yehoshua, Ambassador. The world - wide Shaare Zedek Medical Center family mourns the loss of a dear and cherished friend. As a seasoned diplomat who represented The State of Israel in a variety of capacities for nearly five decades, he vigorously, compellingly, and effectively championed ''Israel's case''. We will forever cherish his efforts that helped place Shaare Zedek internationally in the forefront of state-of-the-art-medical care. May his memory be blessed.
