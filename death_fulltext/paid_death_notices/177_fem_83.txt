        STYLER-Dorothy. The Board of Directors, staff, participants and friends of the Association for the Help of Retarded Children, NYC Chapter, grieve the passing of Dorothy Styler, whose commitment to improving the lives of people with mental retardation and developmental disabilities is legend. Her husband Michael, her children and she are very much a part of the AHRC family. Our grief and prayers go to members of her family. We will miss Dorothy as we miss her husband.
