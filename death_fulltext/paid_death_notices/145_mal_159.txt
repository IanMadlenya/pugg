        MURPHY-Edmond L. With great sadness the employees of Fiduciary Trust Company International note the death of their friend Edmond L. Murphy. Ed was our colleague for more than twenty years until his retirement in 1993. His talent and knowledge as an investor and adviser have been an inspiration to many. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Carol and his entire family.
