        ASHER-William J., Innovator. Bill Asher passed away on February 10, 2000, but not before marrying a lovely lady, producing three wonderful daughters and leading an accomplished career in chemical engineering. He left us after an allout brawl with cancer. He was 65. After winning the Westinghouse National Science Talent Search, Bill earned a B.S. in Chemical Engineering from Purdue University, and a M.S. from Ohio State. Bill spent 29 years at Exxon Research in New Jersey, and was most recently a Chemical Engineer at SRI International in Menlo Park, CA. He is the holder of 27 patents in diverse areas including petroleum and chemical processes, and biomedical advancements. His first patents covered a process for recovering raw materials for biodegradable detergents. He held patents in the biomedical field for the invention of artificial blood and an alternative to kidney dialysis. And recently, he invented an entirely new type of chemical reactor that can be applied to dozens of chemical and petroleum processes. Bill's personal interests were as diverse as his career accomplishments. He was a jazz, wine, sports car, and radio-controlled model airplane enthusiast. Bill is survived by his wife Claire, daughter Lynn, son-in-law Ed; daughter Pam, son-in-law David and their two daughters; and daughter Brenda.
