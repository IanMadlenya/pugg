        TEITELBAUM -- Beatrice Wohl. Beloved wife of William. Loving mother of Linda and Marc. Adoring grandmother, devoted daughter and sister. She had a zest for life and beauty that was contagious, a large and charitable heart, and great courage that never wavered. She will be dearly missed. Graveside service Sunday, January 9 at 11AM at New Montefiore Cemetery in Pinelawn, NY.
        TEITELBAUM -- Bea. Ours were years of loving friendship. The void will always be there, but so will our most wonderful shared memories. Harriet and Arthur
