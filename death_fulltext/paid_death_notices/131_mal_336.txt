        SCHWARTZ-Bernard. The entire NYU Law School community Mourns the tragic death of Proffessor Bernard Schwartz. A member of the NYU Law School family since he came to us as a student in 1944, he joined our faculty in 1947 and has served us in that capacity since that time. A world renowned scholar whose works has been translated into dozens of languages, he will be missed by everyone at NYU, by generations of students, and by lawyers everywhere. Our hearts go out to his wife, Aileen, also a graduate, and to his son Brian. John Sexton, Dean Martin Lipton, Chair, Board of Trustees
