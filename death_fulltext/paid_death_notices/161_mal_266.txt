        HAAS-Hyman. The Haas family announces the loss of Hyman Haas, beloved husband of Esther and cherished father of Janet and Deena. Noted in Ernie Pyle's ''Bravemen'' Sergeant Haas and his men knocked out a pill box on Normandy Beach on D-Day. This action opened a pathway for the soldiers to pass safely. He was a hero then and our hero now. We will miss him.
