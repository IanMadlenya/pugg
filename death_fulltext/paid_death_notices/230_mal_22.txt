        KOHLOFF--Roland. The entire Juilliard community mourn the passing of Roland Kohloff, a member of the faculty since 1978 and Chairman of the Percussion Department. A brilliant performer, dedicated teacher, and compassionate human being, Roland was a passionate advocate also for his students and for his art. With enormous energy and a wonderful smile, Roland approached all endeavors with an enthusiasm that was contagious. His personal and artistic integrity made him a respected and trusted colleague. Our condolences go to his entire family. He will be deeply missed by us all. Bruce Kovner, Chairman Joseph W. Polisi, President
