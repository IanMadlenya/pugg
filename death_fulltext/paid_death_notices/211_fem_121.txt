        PUTTERMAN--Pearl. 96, died August 15th. Wife of the late Isaac; mother of Arnold and Susan Putterman; Judy Lewis (Stan); David and Laurie Putterman. Grandmother of Michael, Daniel, Jonathan, Jordan, Tobi and Eric. Greatgrandmother of Abigail, Isaac, Sydney and Oliver. Sister of Leah Janus and aunt to devoted niece Raizi and nephews Barry and Micah. Attorney, teacher, childrens' advocate in family court, a leader in Hadassah, and the voice of numerous recordings in Yiddish for the Blind. She was a woman ahead of her time yet steeped in the traditions and values of her Jewish heritage--family, education and charity towards others. She was blessed with a full, long and healthy life and will be deeply missed but always remembered and appreciated for all that she gave us. Burial is private. Shiva will be observed at her daughter's home Tuesday 4:30-9PM, and Wednesday and Thursday 25PM and 7-9PM. For those who wish to do so, donations may be made in her memory to Hadassah.
