        MORAN-Joseph M. On September 15, 1999. A former Senior Director of Public Relations at American Airlines and Contributing Editor for Travel Agent Magazine. A devoted husband, father, grandfather and brother. He will be missed by all who came to know his wit, his charm and his unflinching courage and decency. ''What is not eternal,'' said C.S. Lewis, ''is eternally out of date.'' The eternal goodness of this man will live and inspire forever.
