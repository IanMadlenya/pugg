Our beloved Ellie has lost her valiant fight with cancer leaving her devoted husband Morton, adoring children, Michael (Lee), Daniel, Yaakov (Shira), loving sister of Charlotte (Herb) Davidson, & grandchildren. She brought the love of music to a generation of East Rockaway students and to friends and admirers throughout the country.
