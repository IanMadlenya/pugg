        RIPPS--Norman David. Of West Caldwell, NJ, on Thursday, January 15, 2004. After a 76 year life of devotion to every family member, friend, religious and philanthropic endeavor. He was not just my brother. He was brother, also, to every Bayonne childhood and West Caldwell friend, to his Ripps and Buchbinder cousins, his fraternity brothers at U.N.C., to his devoted and caring wife Julia's cousins and family members, to my wife Marcia. Norman was loved and respected by everyone who knew him -because he extended his love and respect to all. Lewis S. Ripps
