        KWARTLER-Dr. Charles. At his home in NYC with his family on May 1, 1998. He and his beautiful Ruth just celebrated their 57th anniversary. Born in Stanislau, Austria in 1911, he spent most of his life in the Hackettstown, NJ area. Best known for his pioneering work in the development of pharmaceutical drugs, including Demerol and Chloroquine, he held 21 patents. During the last 50 years he taught organic chemistry at NYU and held many executive positions in the chemical industry. He had an ardent lifelong commitment to help human rights and education and he worked tirelessly for many organizations: Hackettstown Community Hospital; Warren County Community College; Warren County Vocational Technical School; Hackettstown Board of Education; Warren County Health Care Agency; NJ Board of Higher Education; Jewish Center of Northwest Jersey. Dr. Kwartler was a man with a tremendous life force and a powerful presence. Whether in his lab, in the community, or in his much-loved gardens, he exemplified Kipling's description of filling ''every minute with 60 seconds' worth of distance run.'' He is also survived by his children: Alice, Jeanne and David; his brother, Alan; and by Marcia Aronoff, Rosalie Newman, and Lana Predko. The family would appreciate contributions to Hackettstown Community Hospital, 651 Willow Grove, Hackettstown, NJ 07840 or to Warren County Community College, State Hwy No. 57, Washington, NJ 07882.
