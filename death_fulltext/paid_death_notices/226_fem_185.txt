        MAIZNER--Harriet. Age 94, youngest daughter of Rose and Herman Weiss. Born August 20, 1911, died peacefully early in the morning on November 21, 2005. She was both the irresistible force and the immovable object: when she tilted at windmills, the windmills fell. The youngest daughter of immigrants, she used her beauty, brains and force of will to transcend a difficult childhood and made life conform to her vision and aspirations. Never bound by the strictures and regulations of others, she was a truly liberated woman long before women's lib. Working throughout her life, she was a clothes model, a successful entrepreneur, and a very savvy investor. Harriet was unstintingly generous and always there, and at her best for those in need. Once you met Harriet you never forgot her. Undaunted, undeterred and indominable, she really in the words of her favorite crooner, ''did it my way''. Survived by her daughters Helen Bernstein and Nancy Raskind, her son Andrew, and her beloved grandchildren Steven Bernstein, Valerie Bernstein Melony, Matthew and Brent Raskind, and Rose Maizner. We all will miss Nana's generosity, eccentric spirit and sense of humor. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to: Dorot, 171 West 85 St., New York, NY 10024. www.dorotusa.org
