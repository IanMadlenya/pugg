        LA GRANGE--Eileen Morgan, 95 years old. Wife of Frank Crawford La Grange, deceased in 1964. Mother of Brenda Eileen La Grange Johnson and Louise La Grange Hitt. Eileen loved her life in the Forest Hills Gardens where she lived for over 65 years. The Church in the Gardens and The West Side Tennis Club were her homes away from home. She served as an officer of The Women's Guild and was a leader of the Congregational Church in the Gardens' Sunday School. She worked on Wall Street beside her husband whose company was La Grange and Co., a member of the New York Stock Exchange. She leaves an incredible legacy: her sonin-law J. Howard Johnson and her grandchildren Grange (wife Susan) Grant, Brett and Heather (husband John Sargent). We are proud that Eileen met her greatgrandchildren Crawford and Schuyler Sargent and Garrett Johnson. Louise and her husband Buman added grandsons Ralph, Harold, Crawford and David Hitt. She loved us all. We will miss her forever. The family sends special thanks to her ''Angels''-Mary King, Peggy Hosty, Cathy Meehan and Nora Buckley--for their loving care and to Cathy Cooke for her devotion. Memorial service will be held on Monday, April 12th, at 11 AM at St. James Church, 865 Madison Ave., NY. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to M.D. Anderson Cancer Hospital C/O Dr. John Mendelsohn at 1515 Holcombe Blvd., Houston, TX 77030.
