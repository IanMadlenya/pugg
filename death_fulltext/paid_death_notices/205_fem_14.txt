Born February 19, 1920 in Manhattan where her family had lived since the 1840s, she grew up on Riverside Drive while attending the Barnard School for Girls and Manhattanville College. She married Russell H. Tandy Jr. in 1942 and together they raised three boys in Westfield, N.J. Blessed with a sharp mind and vivacious personality, she was an active member of St. Paul's Church in Westfield, Christ Memorial Chapel in Hobe Sound, Planned Parenthood, and the Jupiter Island Garden Club. She is survived by her sons Russell III, Spencer, and David and grandchildren Napper, Catherine, Corinne, and Peter. There will be a memorial service this spring on Jupiter Island.
