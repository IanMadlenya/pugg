        LINZER-Estelle. The New York Chapter of the United Nations Association is deeply saddened by the passing of longtime Board member and officer Estelle Linzer. With her writings about the origins of UNA, her intimate knowledge of our institution, and her heartfelt conviction about the importance of strong support for the United Nations, she was our memory and our guiding spirit. This is what she will remain. Jutta Bertram-Nothnagel President, UNA New York
