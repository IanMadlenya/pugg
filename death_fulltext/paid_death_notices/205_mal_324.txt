        SCHEINBERG--Labe C., M.D. Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University records with profound sorrow the passing of our distinguished professor emeritus, a founding member of our Saul R. Korey Department of Neurology and Dean of our institution from 1970-1972. Dr. Scheinberg, a member of our faculty since 1956, will be remembered as a conscientious teacher, superb diagnostician, dedicated researcher and compassionate physician. A renowned expert in multiple sclerosis, he established, at Einstein, the first comprehensive care center for patients with MS in the nation. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his children, Susan Kristol, Dr. David Scheinberg, Ellen Ranard, and Amy Jones, to his ten grandchildren, and to the entire family. Dominick P. Purpura, M.D. The Marilyn and Stanley M. Katz Dean Albert Einstein College of Medicine
