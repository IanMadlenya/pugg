        LEVY--Edward. 96 years old, March 29th, 2004. Adored loving husband of 68 years of Helen (Friedman), children Leslie and Jim Levy, Jane and Andrew Dolkart, grandchildren Caren and Jonathan Greenhouse, Laurie Levy, Judith and Peter Dolkart and great-grandchildren Sophie and Caroline Greenhouse. Survived by the youngest of seven siblings, Miriam Horowitz. Brother of the late Sally Rogatz, Hannah Herman, A. Morris Levy, Celia Starkman, Fan Lang Weiss and Marcy Sallick. He was a man of style and elegance whose ethics and moral character were above reproach. Most of all, he was a dedicated family man who worshipped his wife. A wonderful role model for all to follow. A real estate developer, manager and appraiser who loved his work and came to the office through his 95th year. He will be forever missed.
