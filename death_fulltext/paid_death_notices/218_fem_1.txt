        MOORE--Elaine Pohl. Friend and client for many years, her wisdom, intelligence, charity and concern for others offered a unique contribution for good which she exercised with her usual vitality. We will miss her stimulating personality as well as business interactions. Sincere condolences to her children, grandchildren, sister and friends. Neal Klinger, Partner H.J. Behrman & Co.
