        GREEN--James Wilder. The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art note with sorrow the passing of Wilder Green. Wilder was an invaluable colleague from 1956 until 1970, first working in the Department of Architecture and Design, as a key member of the 1964 expansion team, and ultimately running the Museum's Department of Exhibitions. His fine eye and exquisite sense of style will be sorely missed. David Rockefeller Chairman Emeritus Agnes Gund President Emerita Ronald S. Lauder, Chairman Robert B. Menschel, Pres. Glenn D. Lowry, Director The Museum of Modern Art
