        SKOLNIK--Leo. With profound sadness, the Tranquillity family mourns the passing of Leo Skolnik, one of the truest exemplars of the spirit of ''Noblesse Oblige'' first taught by Tranquillity's founder, Elias A. Cohen, and carried on by his niece, our beloved Pearl C. Miller, of blessed memory. From his earliest days as a camper in the 1920's, Leo's love of Tranquillity never dimmed. Over more than 60 years, Leo worked tirelessly to give back to the ''Little Farm and Camp'' that played such an important role in his early life. No one on this earth had more heart than Leo Skolnik. A veteran of WWII, he will be remembered for his courage, his spirit, his generosity and his ever present smile and good cheer. Tranquillity Camp, Inc.
