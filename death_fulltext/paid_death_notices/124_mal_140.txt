        YOUNG-Alexander William Jr. The faculty and staff of the Department of Dermatology at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, & the St. Luke's Roosevelt Medical Center mourn the passing of our esteemed friend and colleague. Dr. Young was a distinguished member of the faculty in our department since 1967 when he was appointed the first full-time Director of the Dermatology Service at St. Luke's Hospital. He was a dedicated teacher to generations of students & house officers and was a valued member of our community who contributed to its quality in a unique way. We extend our deepest sympathy and sincere condolences to his family.
