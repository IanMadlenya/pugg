        HELFGOTT-Hannah Rebetzin. The Yeshiva University family and its affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS) express sorrow upon the recent passing of a deeply cherished Jewish matriarch who was admired in the Bronx Jewish community and beyond. Together with her late beloved husband, YU alumnus Rabbi Dr. Benjamin W. Helfgott, in whose memory she helped establish with her family, friends and former congregants of the Jewish Center of Wakefield and Edenwald in the Bronx, The Rabbi Dr. Benjamin W. Helfgott Course in Practical Halakhah at RIETS, she showed extraordinary loyalty to our institution. Heartfelt condolences are extended to her children: Samson (and Joyce) Helfgott and Mrs. Feiga Burnstein; eight grandchildren and twenty-six great grandchildren. May the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm President Yeshiva University Ronald P.
