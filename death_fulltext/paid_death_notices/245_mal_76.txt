        SZLACHTER--Morris. The Claremont Preparatory School community is deeply saddened by the death of Morris Szlachter, beloved father of our headmaster, Irwin Shlachter. Morris was a wonderful husband for 59 years to his late wife Frida, as well as a dedicated father to Irwin Shlachter and Celia Kessel. He is also survived by his daughter-in-law, Renee and son-in-law, Shlomo; and his grandchildren, Jordan and Adam Shlachter and Tamar and Sarit Kessel. Morris was a Holocaust survivor and hero who helped save the lives of six others during World War II. He will be deeply missed. We extend our heartfelt condolences to the entire family.
