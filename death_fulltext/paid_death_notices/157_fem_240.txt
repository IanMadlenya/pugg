        MELNICK-Babs. Of Forest Hills, NY, died in Washington, D.C. 01 February 2000, of complications from a fall in 1997. A wonderfully warm and open-hearted person loved by all, who never spoke ill of anyone, Babs travelled the world with her beloved daughter Ronnie and welcomed family and friends from far and wide to her home and table. Babs, predeceased by her husband Jack in 1980, is survived by her devoted daughter Ronnie Mae Melnick of Washington, D.C., daughter Carolyn Goldberg and grandson of Phoenix, AZ and brother Isidore Zaroff of Hollywood, FL. Burial was at Old Montefiore Cemetery, St. Albans, NY, 04 February. A memorial service is planned for a later date. As a tribute to her precious mummy, Ronnie has created the Babs Melnick Memorial Fund at the African Wildlife Foundation. Babs always encouraged Ronnie to be adventurous, and was particulary proud of Ronnie's lifelong love of and devotion to Africa. The Babs Melnick Memorial Fund will honor and perpetuate Babs and Ronnie's abiding interest in African wildlife, children and the environment. Contributions in Babs's memory can be made to African Wildlife Foundation/Babs Melnick Memorial Fund, c/o African Wildlife Foundation, 1400 Sixteenth Street, N.W., Suite 120, Washington, D.C. 20036.
