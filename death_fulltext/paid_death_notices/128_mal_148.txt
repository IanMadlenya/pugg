        STEINMAN-Lewis. The Cystic Fibrosis Association of Greater New York marks with profound sorrow the passing of our very good friend and esteemed colleague on September 6, 1997. Lewis, together with his wife Joan, played pivotal roles in the early organizational and fundraising efforts to combat cystic fibrosis. Lew continued his leadership support for over 30 years in dedicated, selfless effort to give the ''breath of life'' to children and young adults with CF. He was a member of the Board of Directors and Corporate Chairman of the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Greater New York. His legacy of caring, love and giving will remain in our hearts. We extend deepfelt condolences to our friend, and Lew's beloved wife Joan, to sons Jeffrey, Peter and Robert and to all of the family. Phyllis L. Kossoff, President Jerome Hershman, Exec. V.P.
