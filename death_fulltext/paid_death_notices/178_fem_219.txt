        STRUHL-Anne. The Yeshiva of North Jersey, its Executive Board, Board of Directors, faculty and student body mourn the loss of Anne Struhl, matriarch of the Yeshiva's first family, who along with her late husband Teddy, and children and grandchildren, have been the life blood of the Yeshiva for sixty years. Mrs. Struhl was to have graced our annual banquet as guest of honor. Instead, she will will grace the heavenly beings with her presence. Heartfelt condolences to children Bernard and Alice Struhl, and Harold and Miriam Struhl, and grandchildren Warren and Robin Struhl, Teddy & Linda Struhl, Teddy and Phyllis Struhl, Barry Struhl, Lisa and Dean Pastor, Terry Heyman, and Michael Heyman, and greatgrandchildren Adam, Sara, Jessica, Jonathan, Arielle, Jackie and Jacob.
