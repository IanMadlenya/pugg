        LEWIS--Lorelei. Died unexpectedly at St. Vincent's Hospital on April 5. Lorelei worked in radio, early television, and book publishing. For twenty years, she was a reporter for Star magazine. Passionate and positive, Lorelei was an unfailing source of support and comfort to her many friends. In her memory, those who knew her may wish to adopt or foster a homeless pet, or contribute to an animal shelter. Or they may learn to tango really well.
