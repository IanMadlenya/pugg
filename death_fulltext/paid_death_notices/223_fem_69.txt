        GROSSMAN--Anna. The officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Anna Grossman, an esteemed benefactor and friend whose exemplary commitment to the Jewish community through the Grossman Foundation marked a life dedicated to tikkun olam. Anna's legacy continues through the efforts of her family, strengthening millions of lives in New York, in Israel, and around the globe. We extend our deepest sympathies to Anna's beloved children, Carl, Gerald, and Alice, and to the entire family. Morris W. Offit, President Susan K. Stern, Chair of the Board John S. Ruskay, Exec.
