        ORINGER--Dr. Maurice J., a 1928 graduate of the NYU College of Dentistry, passed away on November 7, 2004 after a short illness. He was a pioneer in the struggle to raise professional and public awareness of the deadliness of oral cancer and the importance of early diagnosis and treatment. He was a crusader against oral cancer for more than 50 years, starting at a time when many dentists weren't routinely doing oral cancer exams. Dr. Oringer used electrosurgery, a technique he invented, to remove suspected cancerous tissue for examination without the fear of spreading the disease through severed blood vessels. His 1957 lecture, presented at the Greater New York Dental Meeting, ''Electrosurgical Biopsy: A Safe and Simple Technique,'' was covered in the New York WorldTelegram ''Science and Medicine'' section. In 1964, as a consultant to St. Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie, he helped to create an oral cancer prevention and detection clinic, making St. Francis the only hospital in New York to have such a facility. For the next 40 years he continued to lecture extensively on oral cancer at programs sponsored by the New York State Health Department, the American Dental Association, the American Cancer Society, and many other organizations. A loyal alumnus of NYU College of Dentistry, Dr. Oringer created a scholarship fund at his alma mater in 2000 so that students would be able to concentrate on their studies without suffering under the weight of heavy financial debt, parttime jobs, and other distractions. Born on June 18, 1905, he was the youngest of seven children and the only one born in this country. He is survived by his wife, Helen, of 50 years, Judge David Oringer and Judge Philip Maier of New York, Shirley and Fred Maier of New Jersey, Sanford Oringer, Joan Matofsky, Debbie Matofsky, Robert Matofsky, and numerous other nieces and nephews.
