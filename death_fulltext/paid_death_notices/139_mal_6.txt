        ROBBINS-Jerome. The School of American Ballet notes with sorrow the death of its distinguished alumnus & great friend, Jerry Robbins. He was an artist of the first rank, one who could spin choreographic gold when working with legendary ballerinas, Broadway veterans or SAB students. Chairman Albert Bellas, Chairman of Faculty Peter Martins, President Larry Alan Smith and Executive Director Nathalie Gleboff, with the Board, faculty, staff and students join the legions of devastated admirers around the world.
        ROBBINS-Jerome. All of us have had the ''Jerry Experience''; exhilarating, frustrating, challenging, irritating and unforgettable. But, none of us can deny his brilliance as a creator, and what he gave to you as an artist and a professional. The Trustees of The George Balanchine Trust.
