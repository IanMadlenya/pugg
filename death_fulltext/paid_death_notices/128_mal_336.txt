        NIGOGOSIAN-Vahakn. The Board and membership of the Violin Society of America bid a fond farewell to Vahakn Nigogosian. One of America's most important restorers of fine stringed instruments, he was a founding member of the Violin Society, joining the Board of Directors in 1973 and serving it for 24 years. In 1986 he created the Violin Restoration Workshop at Oberlin College, a program he directed for ten years. He will be deeply missed and fondly remembered by his many friends, colleagues, clients and students. Philip J. Kass, President Violin Society of America
