        FRANKLIN--Phyllis. The Modern Language Association mourns the loss of Phyllis Franklin, who died on 20 August 2004 in Coral Gables, Florida. A scholar and teacher of American literature and women's studies, she served with great distinction as executive director of the MLA from 1985 until her retirement in 2002. She wrote on issues affecting the humanities and higher education, edited the journal ''Profession,'' and coedited ''Preparing a Nation's Teachers: Models for English and Foreign Language Programs.'' She initiated survey projects that provided statistical information about the curriculum and trends within the field, advocated for federal funding for the humanities, and collaborated with other organizations to enhance public understanding of the humanities.
