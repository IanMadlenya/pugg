        HAGEDORN--Horace. The Buckley Country Day School community mourns the passing of our good friend Horace Hagedorn. As a former parent and grandparent, and member of the Board of Trustees from 1986 to 1992, Horace shared his wisdom and leadership in the areas of marketing, personnel, development, long-range planning and on various ad-hoc committees. He is remembered by his colleagues on the Board as ''a gentleman and a gentle man who in a quiet way had the power to get things done and did.'' In 1988, he generously established a scholarship fund to aid Buckley's commitment to diversity. Through this endowed fund, students of color who exhibit outstanding scholarship and leadership are afforded the opportunity to benefit from Buckley's superior education. It was with great pride that he supported the philanthropic endeavors of his son James '71 who continued the family legacy with the establishment of the Hagedorn Library Learning Center in 2000 on Buckley's campus. The entire Buckley community expresses heartfelt condolences to his family. We will remember him for the twinkle in his eye and celebrate his life for the difference he made and the joy that he brought to so many.
