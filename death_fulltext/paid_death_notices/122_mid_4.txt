        SAMSON-Arthur C. Our family lost a bright light on March 13. A wonderful husband to Lucille, proud and adoring ''Daddy'' to Peggy and her husband Marty, loving ''Gwampa'' to Nicky and Jake, loyal and loving brother of Betty Beranbaum and the late David Samson, brother-in-law to Hazel, Marvin, Rowie and Sam and caring uncle to their children. We will miss him. Services on Sunday, March 16 at 1:30 at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81 St. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to Temple Israel Of The City of N.Y. or a charity of your choice.
