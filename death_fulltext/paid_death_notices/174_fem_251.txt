Gootman, Professor of Physiology and Pharmacology, and Professor of Pediatrics, a distinguished member of our faculty for more than a quarter century. A pioneering researcher in the field of physiology of newborns and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, Dr. Gootman was a widely respected educator and mentor. Our deepest sympathies are extended to her husband, Dr. Norman Gootman, her children, Dr. Craig Gootman and Dr. Sharon Gootman Rosen, her mother, Mrs. Ida Adler, and her brother, Dr. Saul Adler, as well as to other family members, colleagues and friends.
