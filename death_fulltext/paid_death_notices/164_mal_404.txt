        TUCKER-Ralph W., 56. Died on Feb. 26, 2000, at Mt. Sinai Hospital of complications of multiple myeloma. A free-lance writer, director and producer of industrial films, he learned film-making at the Army Pictorial Center in Astoria after a year's tour of duty in Vietnam. He was born in Bradenton, Fla, graduated from Maryville College in Tennessee, and lived all over the U.S. and in Europe and Asia before settling in New York in 1967. Tucker worked in New York and the U.S. on hundreds of sponsored theatrical films, prizewinning corporate videos, multimedia shows & business theater. Abroad he worked for the Truk Red Cross in Chuuk, Micronesia, and for the Association Internationale des Etudiants en Sciences Economiques et Commerciales. Among his personal works in progress when he fell ill were a play based on Huckleberry Finn, a science-fiction novel and a photojournalism book about the great harbor explosion in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He had planned to begin a book called ''Spine'' about his adventures as a multiple-myeloma patient. The New York Women in Film and Television screenplay reading committee staged a reading, on February 28 at the Cherry Lane Theatre, of ''The History of an Unremarkable Life.'' The play, based on the novel ''Ships That Pass in the Night'' by Beatrice Harraden, was written by Tucker and Heather M. Winters and directed by John Steber. Tucker is survived by his wife, Helen Anne Easterly, and son, Guy, both of New York; his parents, LTC (Ret.) Walter F. and Roberta P. Tucker of St. Petersburg; a sister, BethAnn of Atlanta; and two brothers, Kenneth of St. Petersburg and Robert of Anchorage.
