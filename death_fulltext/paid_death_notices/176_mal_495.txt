        ZEPLIN-Marc Scott. Age 33. We are deeply saddened by the loss of our son-in-law, Marc Zeplin. Beloved husband of Debra and devoted father to Ryan (3) and Ethan (9 months), Marc is also survived by his loving parents, Leonard and Leona; sister, Joslin; and many relatives and friends. Marc was a vice president at Cantor Fitzgerald, and was in the World Trade Center on September 11th. He received his BA and MBA from the University of Michigan. His love, humor, intelligence, caring and generous spirit will forever be with us. We love him and miss him; he is in our hearts always. In Marc's memory, the family requests that donations be made to the Alliance-College Education Fund (please donate separately for Ryan Zeplin and for Ethan Zeplin), c/o Debra Zeplin, 14 Shelley Lane, West Harrison, NY 10604.
