        NATHANSON-Morton, M.D. With profound sorrow we mark the death of Morton Nathanson, M.D., Chairman Emeritus of our hospital's Department of Neurology from 1984 to the present and its Chairman from 1972 to 1984. He was the founder of the Neurology Service at LIJ and through his dedicated efforts an accredited residency program was established that produced scores of welltrained neurologists. Dr. Nathanson was a brilliant teacher and highly respected researcher with over 70 published papers. He was an avid collector of antiquarian and landmark books, particularly those relating to the history of neurology. An extremely energetic man with strong opinions and a great sense of humor, his was truly a robust personality. Our heartfelt condolences go to his wife Margret and his children David, Madlyn and Laura. Gedale Horowitz Chairman of the Board David R. Dantzker, M.D. President and CEO Long Island Jewish Medical Center
