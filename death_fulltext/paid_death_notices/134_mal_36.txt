        ANYAEGBUNAM - Akolisa M., M.D. The Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Women's Health of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center is mourning the untimely passing of our beloved friend and colleague, Dr. Akolisa Anyaegbunam. ''Dr. Akolisa'' or ''Aki'', as he was affectionately known has been a member of our clinical family since 1981 when he first came to the Medical Center as a resident-in-training. Over the past sixteen years he advanced through his academic and scientific accomplishments culminating in his promotion to the rank of Full Professor at the Medical School. In 1997, he was appointed Clinical Chair of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Women's Health at the North Bronx Healthcare Network, encompassing Jacobi Medical Center and North Central Bronx Hospital. He was also the Co-Director of the Department's Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, PastPresident of the Bronx Ob/Gyn Society, an Officer in District II of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and a member of many regional and national societies including the National Medical Association, the Society of Perinatal Obstetricians, and the Society for Gynecologic Investigation. Dr. Akolisa was a devoted and highly-skilled physician, a prominent educator, a prolific author, and a respected and inspiring leader of the medical community throughout the country. His students, residents and colleagues are his legacy. Aki had an uncanny ability to endear himself to everyone who had the privilege of working with him. Countless numbers will grieve his premature loss. Irwin R. Merkatz, M.D., Professor and Chairman, Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Women's Health
