        LICKONA-Edward J. Died peacefully on November 29, 2000, at the age of 86. A native of Poughkeepsie, NY, he and his wife spent their retirement years in Port Orange, FL, before moving to McGraw, NY in 1999 to be closer to family. A quiet man of tender heart and wry humor, he will be forever missed in a million ways by his sweetheart and wife of 60 years, Winnie, his son Tom and his wife Judy of Cortland, NY, his son Terry of Austin, TX, & his daughter Cheryl Lickona-Weckler and her husband Chad, his two grandsons and his five great-grandchildren. Arriverderci, Daddy. We love you...
