        SINGER-Milton, M.D. The Division of Gastroenterology of the Mount Sinai Hospital mourns the loss of our dear friend and respected colleague, Dr. Milton Singer. From his private practice in New Jersey, Dr. Singer travelled to Mount Sinai every week for decades to give the benefit of his teaching and experience to our fellows, residents and students. We shall all miss his gentle warmth, quiet grace, sound judgement, and unfailing wisdom. Steven H. Itzkowitz, M.D., Director David B. Sachar, M.D., Director Emeritus The Dr. Henry D. Janowitz Division of Gastroenterology
