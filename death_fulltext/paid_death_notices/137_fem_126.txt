        STEVENS-Nancy (Mrs. John E.) The Society of Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center mourns the passing of its beloved sixth president. A former journalist and radio personality, Nancy Stevens joined the organization in 1948 and served in several official capacities before being named Society president (1955-1957). The first Society president to bring professional business experience to the volunteer role, Mrs. Stevens presided over a series of successful fundraising events to celebrate The Society's tenth anniversary, initiated patient care programs, and the creation of handbooks for patients, and oversaw the hospital's Gift Shop. Nancy Stevens was an active member of the Past Presidents Committee until shortly before her death. Her wisdom, experience and good spirits will be sorely missed. Mrs. Coleman P. Burke, President The Society of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
