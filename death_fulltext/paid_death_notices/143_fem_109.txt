        ROBBINS-Matilda. Born October 19, 1906, died December 8, 1998. We mourn the loss of our dear mother, sister, mother-in-law, grandma, and great-grandmother, who passed away at the age of 92, in Hallendale, FL. She was the beloved ''bride'' of the late Harry Robbins, devoted mother of Dr. John Robbins, Dr. Anthony L. Robbins and Mr. Marc Robbins; cherished grandmother of Robert Robbins, Daniel Robbins, Ellen Taxman, Dr. David Robbins, Philipe Robbins, Dr. Rebecca Robbins, Nadine Robbins, Maureen Fischer, Brian Robbins, Randi Robbins, Leah Robbins, Jonahthan Robbins, Deborah Robbins, and Jessica Robbins; loving greatgrandmother to 16 great-grandchildren. In the forefront of the family business until the day she died, her gentle humor, courage, firm resolve, love and abiding generosity remain with us forever. ''Tillie'' was devoted to her family and friends. She was an accomplished pianist, an ardent reader, and with Harry, regularly attended the opera and theater. We shall miss you, Grandma, with all our hearts. ''What a rare find is a capable woman, her worth is far beyond that of rubies.''
