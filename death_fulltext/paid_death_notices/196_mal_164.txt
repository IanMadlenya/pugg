        IMBERMAN-Dr. Mark M. It is with profound sorrow that The Mount Sinai Alumni mourns the passing of our dear friend, Dr. Mark Imberman, a devoted physician who exemplified the highest standards of the medical profession. In 2001, The Mount Sinai Alumni presented its coveted special recognition award to Dr. Imberman acknowledging over 60 years of dedication to Mount Sinai, his many contributions to the field of medicine, as well as his dedication to the well being of the medical students as Director of Student Health Services. He had the privilege of participating with his sonin-law at his grandson's recent graduation from the School of Medicine, representing three generations of Mount Sinai Alumni. A compassionate human being and a gentle man, he will be missed by all who knew him. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his entire family. William G. Stein, M.D. President Barry D. Stimmel, M.D. Vice President Elliot Rayfield, M.D. Secretary Betty Mintz, M.D. Treasurer
