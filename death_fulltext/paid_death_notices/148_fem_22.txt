        MOULTON-Ruth, M.D. The William Alanson White Psychoanalytic Institute and Society note with profound grief the death of a woman whose abundant and eloquent life set the standard for generations of professionals. Resolute in her passion for her profession and for this Institute, Ruth Moulton Gilbert was among its most acclaimed architects. She was, and remains, heralded as a distinguished psychoanalyst, an astute, devoted therapist, an inspiring teacher, an uncompromising activist and a proud and tireless feminist. Her writings and achievements were numerous, as were her titles (Fellow Emeritus, Fellow Training and Supervising Analyst, Director of Training), her interests were expansive and cultivated, her directions were courageous and pioneering, her humanity was inexhaustible. As an agent for change, she accomplished goals with artful tenacity, utmost dignity and remarkable modesty. We shall miss her sorely, and oh how greatly will she be remembered. Our heartfelt condolences to her beloved family. Marylou Lionells, Ph.D., Director, White Institute Robert I. Watson, Jr., Ph.D., President, White Society
