        WILLOWS-Judy. The Maternity Center Association's Board of Directors and friends mourn the passing of a dear friend and past President who deeply believed in our organization's ideals and vision on behalf of mothers, babies and their families. Her kindness, grace and generosity touched the lives of many people who were fortunate to know her. We will miss her gentle leadership and good humor very much, and extend our deepest sympathy to her sons, family and friends.
