        CONSTANTINE--Virginia (April 13th, 1920), graduate of Mt. Holyoke College, having fought a courageous fight against cancer, attained her final place this day, October 25th, 2006. She was the loving daughter of John and Corinne Benas, devoted sister to Flora W. Benas and an extraordinary mother to Corinne and Paul. She led a full life, volunteering her time and knowledge to support the mission of the New York Public Library, and immersing herself in the wide variety of culture NYC has to offer. She took much joy in being very close to her sister and children as they supported her in her valiant fight against cancer. In lieu of flowers, she asks for donations to two institutions that gave much to her, the New York Public Library General Fund (where she maintained the information booth for over 15 years after her retirement) and the NYU Cancer Institute (for the extraordinary care she received from the doctors and the staff durIng her 18-month battle against her cancer). There will be a memorial gathering at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Ave. at 81 St., on Saturday, October 28th, 2006, from 5 pm till 8 pm.
