        LOWENSTEIN -- Carolyn B. (nee Burgett) Of Hamilton Parish, Bermuda on October 15, 2006, after a courageous and inspiring fight against cancer. She was a woman of beauty, grace and kindness, beloved wife, mother and friend to many. Carolyn's bravery and dignity during her year-long illness reflected the determination and purpose she brought to all that she did. Born on June 27, 1960, in Frankfurt, Germany, she grew up in Rudgwick, Sussex, England, and attended Benenden School. She graduated from Colorado College in 1984 and subsequently obtained her Master's Degree in Journalism from The University of Arizona in 1986. She married Price Gordon Lowenstein in 1989, and worked as a tv news producer in San Francisco while the couple resided in Marin County, California. She became a full-time mother upon the birth of her first child, James Michael in 1992, and the family moved to Hamilton Parish, Bermuda in 1997. Carolyn was a keen golfer, tennis player and sportswoman who lived her life with energy, enthusiasm, great style, and an unfailing sense of humor. She deeply touched and will be terribly missed by all who knew her. She is survived by her husband, Price Lowenstein, her two children, Jake (14 yrs), and Haley (10 yrs), and a large, loving family-her mother Sharon Burgett, sisters Bambi Goodhew, Lisa Burgett, Leslie Pratt and brother James Burgett. A Memorial Service will be held at noon on Monday, October 23, 2006, at Holy Trinity Church, Baileys Bay, Bermuda. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to The ISIS Foundation, 35 Crow Lane, East Broadway, Paget, Bermuda HM20.
