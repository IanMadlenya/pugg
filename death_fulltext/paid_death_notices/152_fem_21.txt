        BOILLOT-Lynn Hochschild was elected in 1981 to the Board of Directors of The Jacob and Valeria Langeloth Foundation. In the intervening years, she brought to our deliberations a perceptive understanding of our mission in the field of convalescence and a deep sense of compassion for those less fortunate in securing medical support toward this end. The Directors of The Langeloth Foundation extend their sympathies to her immediate family. John L. Loeb, Jr., Chairman Board of Directors The Jacob and Valeria Langeloth Foundation
