        JOHNSTON-James I. The family of James I. Johnston bade farewell to a loving husband and father who passed away January 17, 1998. Jim, a 1953 graduate of the University of Pittsburgh, began his career as a Certified Public Accountant at Touche Ross and Co. After becoming a partner, he was a key contributor to building Touche Ross' international presence. After 25 years at Touche Ross, Jim continued his career at Main Hurdman and KMG, both in the U.S. and in the Netherlands. Jim retired from KPMG in 1988, at which point he married Jean, his soulmate, and started his ''second'' career as retailer and restaurateur. Jim is survived by his loving wife, Jean and their combined families. In lieu of flowers, the Johnston Scholarship Fund has been created for the Cadets of Bergen County Drum Corps. Contributions can be made to ''The Cadets,'' PO Box 506, Bergenfield, NJ 07621.
