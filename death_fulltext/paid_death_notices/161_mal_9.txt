        TAYLOR-Samuel. The Officers, Board of Directors and staff of Dramatists Play Service mourn the passing of our esteemed colleague and friend. Sam was President and Chairman of the Board of the play service for over twenty years. We will miss his artistic and business acumen and his counsel. Sam was not only a successful playwright and screenwriter but a true gentleman in every positive sense of the word. Our deep sympathy goes to his wife, Suzanne, his family and friends. Dramatists Play Service Stephen Sultan, President
