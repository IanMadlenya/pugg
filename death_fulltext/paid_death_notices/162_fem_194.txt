        MARGOLICK-Frances. Died on Tuesday, July 25th after a long illness. Beloved sister of Moses. Sister-in-law of Gert and Evelyn. ''Auntie Frances'' or ''A.F.'' to many nieces and nephews, to whom her tiny apartment on the Upper West Side was a compulsory stop and a safe, loving haven during periodic visits to New York. She will be missed by her family and by her many friends at The New York Times, where she was longtime Secretary to the cultural news editor. Funeral services on Friday in Montreal.
