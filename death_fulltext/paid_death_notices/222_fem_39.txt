        JOHNSON--Marjorie. Age 93, died on July 4, 2005 after a long illness. She was a gentle super intelligent woman with a sense of humor; a teacher librarian who helped everyone while she never stopped fighting for her rights. She was important to her husband Clarence Johnson and her son James who predeceased her. She will be sorely missed by all who knew her. Funeral services will be held at the George H. Weldon Funeral Parlor, 343 E. 116 St, Monday July 11th at 10AM. May Margie's spirit remain to strengthen us.
