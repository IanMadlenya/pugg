        SCHAFFELD-Henry G., M.D. The entire family of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center mourns the passing of Henry G. Schaffeld, MD. A 1941 graduate of the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and a doctor in the U.S. Army during World War II, he founded the first chest clinic at Roosevelt Hospital in 1948. He was a beloved and revered Chief of our Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care who inspired generations of colleagues and students. He was a gifted and caring physician to countless patients who will be sorely missed. To his wife Florence, his family, and his friends, we offer our profoundest condolences. Lawrence S. Huntington Chairman of the Board Robert G. Newman, MD Acting President Richard P. Fried, MD President of the Medical Board
