        MASON-Calman, 85, on May 6. Beloved husband of Gertrude. Father of Ira and Gail, Marilyn and Bob. Grandfather of Bonnie, Michael, Cori, Seth, Jonathan and the late Marc. Great grandfather of Joshua and Zachary. His warmth and love and kindness personified the fullest expression of the goodness in man. We are far richer for having known him.
