        GROSS-Jack. The Partners and Associates of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan mourn the passing, on Sunday, May 11, 2003, of our distinguished Senior Partner, Jack Gross. His legacy to the Bankruptcy Bar will long be remembered. His mentoring skills fostered the careers of a generation of lawyers who will miss him greatly. His love of justice and fair play as well as his charitable endeavors are an example to us all. To his children, Steve and Debbie, his grandchildren and great grandchildren, the Partners and Associates of Stroock extend their deepest sympathy.
