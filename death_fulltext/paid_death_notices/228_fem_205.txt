        ENGLE - Hannah. NYU's Wagner Graduate School of Public Service and Skirball Department of Hebrew & Judaic Studies mourn the loss of Hannah Engle, a woman of incredible energy, talent and passion. Hannah embodied tikkun olam, the healing of the world, through her work, volunteering, and travel. She was a light in the lives of all she touched, and we will miss her dearly.
