        ESTRIN--Joseph, MD. The Medical Staff of Maimonides Medical Center is deeply saddened by the death of Dr. Joseph Estrin. Dr. Estrin was a surgeon, par excellence, in the Dept. of Surgery for over 50 years. His many other talents included art, writing and teaching. He was involved with many aspects of the Medical Staff, having served as President in its early years. He was instrumental in the Art Show for Maimonides Day. His knowledge helped future doctors to become the physicians they are. His smile was infectious. He will be sorely missed by all his friends, colleagues and patients. Sincere condolences are extended to his family. Ira Mayer, MD, President Warren Wexelman, MD, President-Elect Steven Farber, MD, Secretary-Treasurer
