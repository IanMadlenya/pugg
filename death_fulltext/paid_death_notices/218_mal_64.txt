        GASH--James Alan. North Chatham, NY, March 3, 2005, James Alan Gash, better known as Jim, died after living several years with cancer. Only child of the late Etta (Press) Gash and Arthur Gash, he was born in Brooklyn on July 15, 1930. A graduate of Poly Prep and Cornell University, he majored in English and began his avocation for journalism while working on the Cornell Sun. One of his post graduate jobs was with the NBC affiliate in Buffalo. From there he went to WNEW in New York City when that station was at it's peak, with well known on air personalities William B. Williams and Gene Klavan. Jim joined the large news staff and worked there for fifteen years covering city hall, disasters, politicians, and celebrities of the day from Jackie K. to Marilyn M. His talent was to get to the nub of the story and interpret it clearly. He left in 1974 during the city's financial crisis when news operations were cutting back, and moved upstate to work in the press office of the Speaker of the Assembly. Since being a little boy cheering the Dodgers at Ebbets Field, he was more than a fan and knew everything about every player, trade and game. The 2005 Baseball Register is on his desk. He also loved travel, beach sitting, ethnic food and animals. He leaves his wife of forty four years, Wendy, his shaggy dog Muszka, and many friends who relied on his counsel and the rare ability to just listen.
