        STERN -- Howard S. The Board of Directors, Executives, and entire staff of AngioDynamics Inc., mourn the loss of Howard S. Stern, co-founder, former chairman of the board of directors, and current director, who passed away at the age of seventyfour after losing his battle with brain cancer. Mr. Stern co-founded AngioDynamics in 1988 as a division of E-ZEM, Inc. He served as a director of the Company since its inception until his death, and was chairman of the board of directors from the Company's start until February 2004. We have lost a remarkable man, a true leader, and a passionate advocate for the development of medical devices to improve patient care. Howard's insight into the possibilities for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease has made a difference in the lives of patients, and in the physicians who treat them. He was instrumental in guiding AngioDynamics from a development stage company to its present position as a publicly-traded leader in innovative products for the peripheral vascular disease marketplace. We will miss Howard dearly, and extend our deepest sympathies to his family.
