        LANS--Barbara E., died Monday, January 12, 2004 on a beautiful snowy morning she would have greeted with a child's joy, of complications resulting from a fall, which is to say from her fierce independence. She was the Director of the BEL Gallery in Westport which mounted more than 200 exhibits. Postcards and greeting cards with her photographs of local scenes were distributed by CR Gibson and others, and her work also appeared in calendars and magazines. Her poetry was published in poetry magazines and regional newspapers. She was a past Board Member of the Silvermine Guild Arts Center and the Westport Arts Center; an artist member of those two organizations and the Rowayton Arts Center; and a founding member of the Y's Women of Westport/Weston, among her many community activities. She leaves behind her devoted children, Debbie, Stephen, Alan Amos and Maria, and her brother, Mark, and many wonderful friends. Donations in her memory can be made to Silvermine, 1037 Silvermine Road, New Canaan, CT. 06840. There will be a memorial celebration in February.
