        GOLDBERG-George S. On November 1. Beloved husband of the late Rose. Cherished father of Gary Goldberg and Deedee Friedman. Adored grandfather of Michael and David Friedman. Dear brother of Jimmy Goldberg. Human rights advocate. He marched under many banners during his lifetime. He will be most sorely missed for his sense of humor.
