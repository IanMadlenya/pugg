        PILGRIM-James F. The Trustees and Staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn with deep sadness the passing of our respected colleague, Jim Pilgrim. Over 17 years at the Museum, from 1971 to 1988-first in the Department of American Painting and Sculpture and afterward in various administrative capacities, culminating in that of deputy director for curatorial affairs-he demonstrated a long standing and steadfast commitment to the highest standards of professional excellence. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, our treasured colleague Katharine Baetjer, and to the entire family.
