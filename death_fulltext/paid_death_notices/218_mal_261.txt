        SHORT--Bobby. From the earliest days of Jazz at Lincoln Center in 1989-90, Bobby Short was a cherished part of our family. He was an abiding friend of so many of our artists and board members, an honored performer at our programs and benefits, and a generous early patron. But his greatest gift to all who knew or heard him perform was his joyful sophisticated reverence for the swing, brilliance, and transcending spirit--high and low--of America's music, jazz and blues. He was a bright star in the clear night sky whose dazzling light will shine for years to come. We will miss him so much. The Board, Artists and Staff of Jazz at Lincoln Center Gordon J. Davis, Founding Chairman Lisa Schiff, Chairman Wynton Marsalis, Artistic Director Derek Gordon, President Katherine E. Brown, Executive Director
