        GUTHRIE-Henry B. The Board of Directors of the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation records with deep sorrow the death of our distinguished colleague on February 12, 1997. He served as a member of the Board since the Foundation was established, in 1946. As chairman of the Board for several years, he provided critical guidance in developing the Foundation's approach to its mission of supporting chemistry research and education. We will greatly miss his sound judgment and wise counsel.
