        HIRSHON-Dorothy H. The Board of Trustees mark with deep sadness the sudden death of Dorothy H. Hirshon, a vital, impassioned leader who has been at the heart of the New School for 61 of its 79 years. A Trustee of the New School since 1941 and Chair of the Board from 1980 to 1985, Mrs. Hirshon began her affiliation in 1937 as a Board member of the University in Exile, established to provide an intellectual home for refugee scholars from National Socialism. She led the Parsons Board of Governors in the 1980s and was involved in every facet of the University from her earliest days on the Board to her last. As Chair, she expressed a passionate commitment to the rebuilding of the Graduate Faculty, and the tradition of a committed Board bears her imprint. In recognition of her enduring commitment to the ideals of the University in Exile, the Board in 1985 honored her by establishiing the Dorothy H. Hirshon Fellowship, which provides funding to students from nations in which intellectual freedom has been abridged. She later established the Dorothy H. Hirshon Professorship in the Graduate Faculty. She also envisioned the University as a national center for the arts and played a major leadership role in the Mannes College of Music and the School of Dramatic Arts, as well as Parsons. We will miss the fierce commitment to excellence, the probing intellect and the love she brought to our community in these 60 plus years. We extend our deepest sympathy to daughter Hilary and Joseph Califano, son Jeffrey and Valerie Paley, and stepdaughter Joy Briggs, her grandchildren and her great-grandchildren. A Memorial Service will be held at Tishman Auditorium, New School, 66 West 12th Street, on Thursday, March 5, at 11:30 A.M. John L. Tishman, Chair Board of Trustees Jonathan F. Fanton, President New School
        HIRSHON - Dorothy H. The Trustees of the Taconic Foundation note with great sorrow the death of our beloved colleague, Dorothy Hirshon. Her thirty-nine years of wise and devoted service to the Foundation reflected her strong and steadfast commitment to equal opportunity, public education and the people of the City of New York. We will always be grateful for her stewardship and friendship-and to the late Audrey and Stephen Currier, the founders of Taconic, for bringing us together.
