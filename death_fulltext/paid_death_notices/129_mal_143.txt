        COREN-Arnold S. On Sunday, October 12, of Woodmere, New York. Loving husband and best friend of Miriam. Caring father & father-in-law of Alice and Larry Reichenberg, George and Nancy Coren. Cherished grandfather of Jason, David, Jeffrey and Andrew. Beloved brother of Mildred Rothman. A ''gentle-man.'' His integrity, compassion and charm showed us the way. His strength of character and unyielding will to survive was, and always will be, an inspiration to all those whose lives he touched. He will live on in all of our hearts.
        COREN-Arnold. The Woodmere Club deeply regrets the passing of our good friend and longtime member, Arnold Coren. Our heartfelt sympathies are extended to his wife Miriam and to the other members of the family.
        COREN-Arnold. We have lost a cherished friend. A fine gentle man. Sincere sympathy to Miriam, the children and grandchildren. Audrey and Jimmy Goodman Harriet and Bob Levy
