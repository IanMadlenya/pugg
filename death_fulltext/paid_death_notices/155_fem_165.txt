        COGAN-Martha Sharp. The Unitarian Universalist Service Committee mourns the death and honors the life of Martha Sharp Cogan, one of our founders. This courageous woman undertook our first dangerous mission to Prague in 1939 to rescue countless women, men and children fleeing Nazi persecution. She then served in Europe as our first Co-Commissioner. Her life is an inspiration to us all. Our sympathy to her children, grandchildren and greatgrandchildren, and to her nephew and his family.
