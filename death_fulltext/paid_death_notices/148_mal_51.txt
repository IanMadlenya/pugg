        BERGMAN-Dr. Robert P. The Trustees, members and staff of the Association of Art Museum Directors mourn the death of Dr. Robert P. Bergman, Director of The Cleveland Museum of Art, and Former President of the Association. His leadership, intellect, and sense of humor will be missed by all of us who had the privilege of working with him. Dr. Bergman's commitment to making our museums truly receptive to diverse audiences at The Walters Art Gallery and at The Cleveland Museum of Art was a source of inspiration to his many colleagues throughout this country. Our deepest sympathy to his wife, daughter and members of his family. Vishakha N. Desai, President Association of Art Museum Directors Millicent Hall Gaudieri, Exec. Dir.
