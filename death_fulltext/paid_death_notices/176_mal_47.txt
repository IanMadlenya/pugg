        WATSON-James L. The Board of Directors and members of the Customs and International Trade Bar Association (CITBA) offer our condolences to the family and friends of Judge Watson, a Judge of the United States Court of International Trade for more than 3 decades. Judge Watson was a man of compassion and a true believer in the rule of law. His decisions were fair, well reasoned, and beautifully written and always garnered the respect of the litigants before him and of the bench and bar. He always was helpful to the attorneys practicing before him and always taught the lesson of understanding and presenting the facts and the law fully and fairly. We will all miss his wisdom, friendship, and counsel. Sidney N. Weiss, President CITBA
