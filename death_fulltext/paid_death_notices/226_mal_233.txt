        LeROY--Maximilian Warner. During his all too short life Maximilian (universally known as Max) Warner LeRoy--beloved son of Kay LeRoy and precious brother to Bridget Warner LeRoy, Carolyn Plum LeRoy and Jennifer Oz LeRoy--embraced an extraordinary number of people with a singular charisma during his 30 years; a life ended by a motorcycle accident in Los Angeles on November 3rd. He was a literal, as well as figurative, embrace. Max was a hugger par excellence, a habit that started in early childhood when his parents tried to teach him how to shake hands in greeting; he preferred hugging. Visitors to the LeRoy household were routinely assaulted by a dark-haired, dark-eyed ball of energy who threw himself at them, hugging whatever body parts he could best reach. After what became his signature hug (just a little longer, just a little tighter and just a little more loving than anyone else's), Max would step back to ask the hug-ee's name. He embraced life just as ferociously and with as much abandon. And he had an enormous capacity for living, because he was so prodigiously talented. The word ''best'' always surfaced when Max was discussed by his family and friends. He was the best musician, the best writer, the best cook, the best at getting the party going, the best at getting the girls, the best son, the best brother and the best friend. Most of all, he was the best at loving those same family and friends, the latter an always increasing circle of people he embraced--literally! Without that special Max love, reinforced by that patented Max hug, the world is a colder, harsher and lonelier place for all who knew him. The solace is that Max will now always be so young, so handsome and so vital, while the rest of us will not be so lucky.
