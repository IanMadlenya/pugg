        RACOV-Achi. The staff of Pre-Diction Inc wish to express their profound sorrow at the passing of Professor Achi Racov on December 16.

A dynamic and inspiring leader, his guidance and advice is a legacy he leaves us all. The staff of Pre-Diction offers their deep and sincere condolences to his wife, Yael, and daughters, Ashley and Katia.
