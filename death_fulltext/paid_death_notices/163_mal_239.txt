        OWEN-Neil. We mourn our dear friend Neil, a rare human being who shared with us his special vision of the joys of life, and whose kindness, generosity, wisdom and caring advice to each of us, individually, and to us, as a family, will never be forgotten and can never be replaced. We leaned on him, learned from him, and loved him as did so many others who were fortunate enough to benefit from his presence in their lives. We feel lucky to have known him and are bereft at his tragically premature departure. Our hearts go out to his wife and devoted partner, Dee. We will miss him deeply and forever cherish his memory. Eleanor, Pamela and Lisa Foa
