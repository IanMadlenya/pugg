        CASTOR-Harold. On January 5, 2000, Harold Castor passed away. The world has lost a great artist whose works appear everywhere from the National Cathedral to America's corporate headquarters and private collections. His unsurpassed talent was exceeded only by his profound humanity. He made the world more beautiful and more interesting. A memorial service will be held on Sunday, February 13, 2000, at 12 noon at Christ United Methodist Church, 1200 North Avenue, New Rochelle, NY. In lieu of flowers contributions can be made to Christ United Methodist Church. The Cooper Family
