        ALEXANDER--Deanie. It is with deep sadness that we mourn the passing of our beloved friend and relative. Deanie's life was a testament to her abiding interest in friends, civic life, music and New York City's children. Her distinguished career in the New York City Health Department ensured that thousands of children had safe, enriching summer camp experiences. Deanie was devoted to her late sister Elizabeth C. Beine with whom she shared a wonderful life and many adventures. Funeral services will be held at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street Thursday, April 27 at 1PM. Gifts in Deanie's memory may be made to Citizens Committee for Children of New York, 105 East 22nd St, 7th Floor, NY, NY 10010.
