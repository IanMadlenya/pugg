        ZARUCKI-Charles. We mourn the loss of our beloved friend, our business partner, and confidant, who brought forth great strength, wisdom, and courage to all those who were privileged to have shared in his life. We are deeply saddened by the sudden passing of such an inspiration and we extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife Rose, his daughters, his son-in-laws, and his grandchildren. As a Holocaust survivor who endured the unimaginable hardship of losing his entire family during the darkest of times, he came to the United States determined to create a new life. Never once forgetting his roots, he strove endlessly towards his commitment to the community and his beloved State of Israel. His charitable contributions to the needy, to the remembrance of the Holocaust, and to Israel are very well-known and his legacy for such kindness and caring will be with us forever. May the knowledge of the support of so many friends help to sustain the family at this time. Mr. and Mrs. Henry Baigelman and family Mr. and Mrs. Simon Baigelman and family Mr. and Mrs. Jack Glazer and family Mrs. Miriam Oster, Mr. Daniel Oster Mr. and Mrs. Abe Oster and family
