        ZWICKER-Sally, December 2, 1997. A sweet and gentle woman who left an indelible mark upon her family who treasured her company, respected her counsel and never stopped appreciating her love and devotion. Her respect for others' feelings, her selflessness and humility, her lively intelligence and her courage in the face of great tragedy will always inspire us. Predeceased by her husband Benjamin and daughter Naomi, she is lovingly remembered by her daughter Phyllis and sister Anne, grandchildren Ellen (Mark), Randi (Howie), Paul (Jackie), Barry (Laurie) and Bradley (Patti), and great-grandchildren Alexander, Joshua, Adam, Alixandra, Nicole, Risa, Sam, Rachel and Zachary.
