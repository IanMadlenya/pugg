        PERLOFF - Pearl. Died Thanksgiving morning, Thursday, November 24, 2005. She wanted everyone to know that she had a wonderful life and was grateful for everything she received. Married in 1933 to Frank Perloff, she was immensely proud of and completely loyal to her husband. The couple enjoyed more than 60 wonderful years together. Only after her children Michael and Bonnie completed college, did Pearl return to Adelphi College to achieve her own degree. When her plans to continue on to law school were thwarted, she returned to helping others, devoting much time and energy to charitable works at The Brookdale Hospital Medical Center and the Jeri Finesilver Cancer Foundation. When her daughter, Bonnie Perloff Fowler, died of colon cancer, Pearl established the PerloffFowler fund for the prevention of cancer to help those who could not otherwise afford the expense of testing and preventing colon cancer. An eager student and lifelong learner herself, the Lifelong Learning Society on the Jupiter Campus of Florida Atlantic University, where she continued to be an avid student, will dedicate two buildings to be named in her honor on January 8, 2006. She was a proud and adoring mother of her son Michael, her late daughter Bonnie Perloff Fowler, and her son-in-law Sanders Fowler III. The lights of her life were her granddaughter Sarah Fowler Bird, her great - granddaughter Eli zabeth Bird, and Sarah's husband Christopher Bird. She will be missed by all who knew her. Donations may be made to the Perloff-Fowler Fund for the Prevention of Cancer at the Jupiter Medical Center, Jupiter, FL.
