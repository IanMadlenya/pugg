        MERJANIAN-Barbara. The students, faculty, administrators and alumni of the Fordham University Graduate School of Social Service mourn the passing of Barbara Merjanian who was such a devoted, loyal and dedicated graduate of the school. In her profession and personal life, she reflected the values of the Jesuit tradition and the social work profession. Our deepest sympathies are extended to her family, especially her husband Stephen, who has been so supportive of the school's programs. Barbara will be very much missed. Dr. Mary Ann Quaranta, Dean
