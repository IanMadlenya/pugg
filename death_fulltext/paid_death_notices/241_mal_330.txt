        ALSTADT--Donald Martin. Polytechnic University mourns the passing of Donald M. Alstadt, former trustee of the University and noted chemist, inventor, and industrialist. Dr. Alstadt made tremendous contributions to the scientific field and to the many organizations and institutions he served. We express our deepest sympathy to his wife, Judith, and his daughter, Karen.
