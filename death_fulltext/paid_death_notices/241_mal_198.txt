        GORDON--Harold M., M.D., on February 14th, 2007, at 89 years of age. Beloved husband of 66 years to Annette Newman Gordon. Devoted father of Elizabeth (Neil) Lowenbraun, Margaret (Alan) Ritch, and James (Ann). Proud grandfather of Grace, Matthew, Holter and Neela, Devon and Brenna. He was the son of Charles and Frieda Gordon and was predeceased by his brother David and his sister Henrietta. A graduate of the Johns Hopkins University, Harvard University, and New York Medical College, he served as a medical officer in the second World War. Dr. Gordon practiced Internal medicine in Cedarhurst, NY, for 37 years. He combined a broad and profound knowledge of clinical medicine with a deep respect for his patients, and he continued his involvement with the medical profession up until his death. He will be sorely missed by his twin sister, Katherine Beckwith, his sisters-and brothers-in-law, Dorothy and Donald Seligman and Edith and Joseph Weinberger, his many nieces and nephews, and a wide circle of friends and collegues. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The Gordon Library Endowment at the University of California at Santa Cruz.
