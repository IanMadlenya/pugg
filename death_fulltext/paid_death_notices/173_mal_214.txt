        HIRSCH-Cantor Erwin. Cantor Erwin Hirsch sang to the honor and glory of Congregation Habonim for fifty-five years. His innate dignity and spirituality found musical expression in the beautiful songs of Zion, with which he inspired at least three generations of worshippers. He was a wonderful teacher to all his students, from the youngest to the oldest. Born in Mannheim, Germany, Cantor Hirsch had just begun his career when he was forced to flee. He came to New York to the Congregation founded in 1939 by Rabbi Hugo Hahn especially to serve the community of newly-arrived German-speaking Jews. There he met the very young, just-hired organist & choir director, Martel Sommer, who became his wife & cherished lifelong partner. Their children, David and Judy, became part of the Habonim family too. We extend heartfelt sympathy to all of them, to the grandchildren, and to their many dear friends. Cantor Hirsch's voice will still be heard for generations to come. Funeral service Thursday, June 21, 12 Noon, at Congregation Habonim, 44 West 66th Street, N.Y.
