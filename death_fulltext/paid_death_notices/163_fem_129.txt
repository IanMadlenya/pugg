        REINHARD-Lucienne. Consist International would like to extend its heartfelt condolences to Albert and Mimi Reinhard and Shasa Weitman on the passing of their beloved daughter and sister Lucienne. Lucy, as affectionately known, was an exemplar of courage, dignity, and grace. Her will to live taught us the meaning of strength and fortitude. She will be missed and her memory will be everlasting.
