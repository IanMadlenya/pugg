        OSTOW--Mortimer. We announce with a deep sense of loss the passing of Dr. Mortimer Ostow, who was for many decades the director and scientific leader of the Psychoanalytic Research and Development Fund. His leadership established the intellectual exchange of colleagues in the field of psychoanalysis with many resulting publications. His own creative studies and publications in so many areas of the human experience was a model to all of us. We shall continue to follow his legacy. Peter B. Neubauer, MD Henry Nunberg, MD, Executive Secretary of the Psychoanalytic Research and Development Fund
