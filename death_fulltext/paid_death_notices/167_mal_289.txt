Lindsay, Mayor of New York City (1966-1973), member, U.S. Congress (1959-1966) and Director Emeritus of Lincoln Center. As Mayor, John Lindsay served ex officio on the Lincoln Center Board from 1966 to 1974 and he returned to the Board from 1984 to 1991 as the designee of the Lincoln Center Theater which he served as Chairman throughout that time. This beloved man of many achievements and unparalleled style served the people of New York City wisely & well throughout his career. We at Lincoln Center are grateful for his crucial role in ushering in a whole new and vibrant era for Lincoln Center Theater, one that extends to this day. We extend our deep sympathy to his wife, Mary and their children, Katharine L. Lake, Margaret Picotte, Anne R. Lindsay, John V. Lindsay, Jr. and to their grandchildren.
