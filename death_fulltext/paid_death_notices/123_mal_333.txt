        SCHLACHET-Stefan. With deep sorrow the Schlachet family acknowledges the death of Dr. Stefan Schlachet on April 27, 1997; a man of integrity and love for his family. Born in Poland on July 22, 1911, he earned his medical degree in Prague and devoted himself to his patients for more than sixty years. His life was marked by genuine regard for others, and by the strong love he felt for his family: his wife, Marta; his children and grandchildren: Hetti, Rob, Matthew and Rebecca Perlmutter, and Annie, Neil and Danielle Garfield; and his extended family. He inspired great love, admiration and devotion from all who knew him. Services on Tuesday at Schwartz Brothers-Jeffer Memorial Chapel in Queens. Shiva will be held at the home of Hetti and Rob Perlmutter, Tuesday-Friday.
