        HOVEYDA--Fereydoun. The National Committee on American Foreign Policy (NCAFP) mourns the death of Fereydoun Hoveyda, former Iranian ambassador to the United Nations. There as a young international civil servant, he played a role in drafting the Universal Declaration on Human Rights in 1948. For more than 20 years, Fereydoun Hoveyda contributed to the NCAFP and by extension to the security interests of the United States, of which he was a proud citizen, in a multitude of ways: as a member of the Executive Committee, a Trustee, the Director of the project on ''The Middle East: Islamic Law and Peace'' and as Senior Fellow. He was a frequent contributor to the NCAFP's bimonthly journal, ''American Foreign Policy Interests,'' in which he developed his telling concept of Islamic fundamentalism and expressed his opposition to the baneful effects of patriarchal societies. A polymath who wrote in several languages, he was as comfortable reviewing films as he was analyzing contemporary and past political developments. The NCAFP extends its deepest sympathy to Ambassador Hoveyda's family. William J. Flynn, Chairman George D. Schwab, President
