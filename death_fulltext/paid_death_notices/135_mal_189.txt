        OSWALD-William E., 59. Passed from this life on April 8 due to complications from lung cancer. He will be sorely missed by Tom Skews and Charles McGlinnen, his partners in business and life. Bill was known to many in the display industry as an example of a true gentleman and friend. Due to his wishes, there was no service held, but a future tribute is being planned. We will always love and think of you, Billy.
