        GARRIGUE-Sheila Kathleen. Died peacefully June 9, 2001, at her home in Chappaqua after a long battle with cancer. She was born December 30, 1931, in England, to Kathleen Norah and Edward Donaldson Hogg. At age seven, she was evacuated to Canada to escape the German air raids of World War II. At the war's end, she returned to parents and a home she barely remembered. At eighteen, she took her first job as secretary to the colorful Ian Robert Maxwell. Six years later she left England to work her way around the world, working for KCBS in San Francisco before becoming Executive Assistant to Edward R. Murrow at CBS News in New York. On March 14, 1959, she married Paul Garrigue, whom she had met aboard the ship that brought her from England to the United States. Mrs. Garrigue published three acclaimed children's novels, each of which was translated into several languages: ''All the Children Were Sent Away,'' ''Between Friends'' and ''The Eternal Spring of Mr. Ito.'' The first and third books were based on her own wartime experiences. She was a sought-after speaker at schools throughout the eastern U.S., and corresponded with many children who had read her books. She spent many happy hours over more than two decades with the Chappaqua Drama Group, performing every function from acting and producing to selecting plays and serving as the group's president. An accomplished linguist, she loved reading, writing poetry, telling stories, painting and gardening, and was known for her creativity and dry wit. Above all, she was devoted to her family. Mrs. Garrigue is survived by her husband Paul, her children Matthew, Andrew and Elizabeth, and her granddaughter Madeleine.
