        SCHAAP-Dick. We are deeply saddened by the passing of Dick Schaap, an early and ardent supporter of an Olympic Games in New York City. The great chronicler of New York sports, its glorious history, colorful personalities and extraordinary events, he was a friend and mentor and the source of unequaled inspiration. We miss him and will always cherish his wisdom, enthusiasm and gentle humor. Our condolences to Trish and the family. NYC2012 Jay L. Kriegel Executive Director
