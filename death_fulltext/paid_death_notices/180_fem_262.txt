        HEIFERMAN-Celia F. The Board of Trustees and Administration of Parker Jewish Institute for Health Care & Rehabilitation are deeply saddened by the loss of Celia Heiferman. Celia's late husband, Solomon Heiferman, was a respected Trustee who served as Chairman of the Board from 1978 to 1981. Celia continued to support the mission of Parker as a member of the Founders Society and by establishing a fund for educational programs to improve the quality of later life. Our condolences and deepest sympathy to her daughter, Ruth Heiferman Prenner, and other members of the family. Barbara N. Kurshan, Chair of the Board Barry T. Zeman, President
