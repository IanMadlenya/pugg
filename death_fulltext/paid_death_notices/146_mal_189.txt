        WEINSTEIN-Robert B. We mourn the death of our dear friend Bob, steadfast in good times and bad, expert on an amazing variety of music, marvelous traveling companion, Boatmaster, computer wizard, a man with a brilliant sense of the absurd, and generally keeper of the flame. We are all diminished by his loss. The circle of friends known as the Foon Platoon
