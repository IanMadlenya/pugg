        NOYES--Carol R. The Board, Council and staff of Planned Parenthood of New York City are deeply saddened by the death of Honorary Board member Carol R. Noyes. Carol joined the PPNYC Board in 1966, and served with distinction on nearly every agency committee. Carol was an outstanding fundraiser and was herself a very generous supporter of our programs. We will long remember Carol for her half century commitment to this agency and to the health and rights of women in New York City. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to her entire family. Patricia J. Volland, Chair PPNYC Board of Directors Joan Malin, President & CEO
