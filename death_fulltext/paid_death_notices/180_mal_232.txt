        GOLDSTINE-Rabbi Melvin L. We mourn with profound sorrow the passing of our beloved colleague. After ordination, he served Anshe Emet Synagogue and was founding rabbi to Congregation B'Nai Emunah, both in the Chicago area. In 1968, he became founding rabbi of Temple Aliyah in Woodland Hills, CA which he served for 25 years until he became rabbi emeritus in 1993. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Bella; daughters, Dr. Deborah and Ruth; and to all who were touched through his rabbinate. Rabbi Vernon H. Kurtz, Pres. Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Exec. VP The Rabbinical Assembly
