        KALB - KOMARIN - Sharon. With deepest sorrow we mourn the passing of this blue-eyed wonder, mother of Jenna, Zoe, and Wyatt. Wife of Gary, daughter of Judy and Morty Kalb, sister of Tom Kalb and Laurie Kalb Kaswiner, and daughter-inlaw of Francie Komarin. Sharon had a deep appreciation for the most elemental aspects of life, a no-nonsense 'look things in the eye' manner, and a true sense of commitment to her children and her husband in everything she did. Sharon was possessed of a terrific ear for language, and was working on a novel as well as several short stories at the time of her passing. She also collaborated on a childrens book with her husband, Gary, which will soon be published. We have in Sharon, a truly beautiful individual both physically and spiritually. We love you up to the sun and moon and stars for all time.
