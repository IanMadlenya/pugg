        LUCAS--Dr. Mary, 61, passed away peacefully on December 2, 2004 with her family and close friends at her bedside. She was born in Ridgewood, NJ on August 23rd, 1943 but was a long time resident of Manhattan. Mary is survived by her husband of 38 years Charles, daughter Selena, brother David Ford, his wife Marge and their children Kate and Peter. She was predeceased by her parents Betty and Stan Ford. Mary was a graduate of Tulane University and received a Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from Columbia University. A kind and loving person, she devoted her entire professional career in the service of individuals with developmental disabilities. She served as Executive VP of Lifespire until the time of her passing and was a member of the Board of Directors of the Inter-Agency Council until recently.

Family, friends and colleagues will fondly remember her life at a memorial service shortly after the holiday season.
