        CHAICE-Herbert H. The law firm of Patterson, Belknap, Webb & Tyler LLP mourns the death of our colleague, Herb Chaice, a superb lawyer and good friend, who retired from active practice in 1999. He brought true meaning to the term ''counsellor-at-law.'' He leaves us his wisdom, his love for the law, and the care and concern he brought to every client. We will all miss his leadership, his experience, and his wit. Our deepest condolences to Judith and the entire Chaice family.
