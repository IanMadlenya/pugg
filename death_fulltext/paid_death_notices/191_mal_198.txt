        FREEMAN-Matthew Che. Matthew Che Freeman, 24, of Chicago on December 13. Dearly loved by his partner Erin Hustings, his parents, Catherine Kallal and Joshua Freeman, step parents, Maurice Lemon & Patricia Kelly, brothers Adam Freeman and Paul Lemon, grandparents Kit and Robert Kallal, Herb Freeman and the late Irene Freeman and numerous aunts, uncles, cousins and wonderful friends. Matthew graduated in 1996 from Evanston Township High School. He attended Grinnell College and was soon to graduate from Roosevelt University with a major in Sociology. Employed at Whole Foods in Lakewview, Matt enjoyed the outdoors, was a devoted fan of all the Chicago sports teams, and appreciated a wide array of musical tastes and styles. Matt was a bright, gentle, funny, and loving young man. The challenge of creating just, healthy, diverse intergenerational communities aroused his brillance and passion and might well have formed his career. The loss of Matthew's caring and sensitive presence is and will be deeply felt by all whose lives he touched. Memorial services were held at the Unitarian Church of Evanston, 1330 Ridge Avenue, Evanston, IL, on Wednesday, December 18. In lieu of flowers, donations can be sent to a foundation being set up in Matthew's name (please contact the family), or to Habitat for Humanity.
