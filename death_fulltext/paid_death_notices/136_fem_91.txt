        TAFT-Bunnee (Sarah). The American Friends of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem mourn with sorrow the passing of Bunnee Taft, an extraordinary supporter who established the Allen R. Taft Wing of the Hebrew University Faculty of Law School and was a founder of the Florida House of the Faculty of Humanities. Because of her love for Israel and the Hebrew University, she funded scholarships through the Golda Meir Fellowship Fund and the Avraham Harman Memorial Foundation. Involved with AFHU since 1971 she was a treasured member of our council of Trustees and Honorary member of the Board of Governors. To her entire family we extend our deepest condolences.
