        BLOCK-Morris, M.D. The faculty and staff of the NYU Medical Center and NYU School of Medicine mourn the passing of Morris Block, Associate Professor of Clinical Medicine. Dr. Block was a longtime member of the faculty and a 1927 graduate of the School of Medicine. An expert on pneumococcal pneumonia, he was a member of various medical societies and a Fellow of the New York Academy of Medicine. We extend our deepest sympathies to his entire family. Robert M. Glickman, M.D. Dean, NYU School of Medicine Theresa Bischoff, President, NYU Hospitals Center
