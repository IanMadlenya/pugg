        ISAAC--M. Al. The Board of Directors and Staff of the Salvadori Center, City College, NY, deeply mourn the sudden, tragic passing of our friend and colleague, Al Isaac, on Wednesday, December 1st. He would have been 37 on Christmas Day. More than a dozen years ago, with our beloved Founder, Mario Salvadori, he created the prototype of the Salvadori Architect-Educator. With unmatched creativity, commitment and service, he served as a mentor and role model for thousands of young students, hundreds of teachers, and scores of colleagues. No words can properly express our love or loss. Lorraine Whitman, Exec. Dir. Salvadori Center
