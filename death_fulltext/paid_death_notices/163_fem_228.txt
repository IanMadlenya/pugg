        BENIOFF-Florence. The Board of Directors and Staff of the Jewish Outreach Institute in New York mourn the passing of Florence Benioff, loving mother of our esteemed member of the board and advocate, Barbara Friedman. Through her life, she taught the values that live on in her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, to whom we express our deepest sympathy: to Barbara and her husband Stephen and all the members of the family. Terry Elkes, President David Sacks, Chairman Dr. Kerry M. Olitzky, Exec. Dir. Dr. Egon Mayer, Dir. of Research
