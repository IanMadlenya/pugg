        SONNENKLAR-Dr. Norman, joined the staff of the Department of Anesthesiology as a House Staff Officer in 1967 and was appointed to the faculty as an Assistant Clinical Professor in 1968. In 1984, he assumed responsibilities as Director of Urologic Anesthesia and Assistant Clinical Coordinator of the operating rooms at The Mount Sinai Hospital. In January 1985 he undertook one of the most important and challenging positions in the Department of Anesthesiology as Chief of Anesthesia at the Elmhurst Hospital Center. Dr. Sonnenklar was promoted to the rank of Associate Professor of Clinical Anesthesiology effective January 1, 1986. He was appointed as Assistant Dean for Clinical Affairs and represented Elmhurst faculty as a member of the Dean's Committee and Academic Council. He also served as President of the Elmhurst Medical Board and President of the Faculty Practice at Elmhurst and Queens Hospital Centers. Dr. Sonnenklar was an outstanding clinical anesthesiologist who for over 30 years contributed to the Mount Sinai School of Medicine and its related educational programs. In the time that he served as Chief of Anesthesiology at Elmhurst Hospital Center, he made dramatic changes in both clinical care and teaching. His colleagues and friends in the Department of Anesthesiology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine and Elmhurst Hospital Center will miss Norman. We extend sincere condolences to Susan, Alan and Jill, Eric and Lisa, and his three grandsons, Jacob, Adam, and Harris.
