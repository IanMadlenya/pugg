        CARSWELL -- Donald. The Brooklyn Hospital Center is deeply saddened by the passing of its esteemed Trustee, Donald Carswell. In 1960, Mr. Carswell joined the Board of Caledonian Hospital in East Flatbush, Brooklyn where he served until 1982 when Caledonian Hospital merged with the Brooklyn Hospital Center. Since then, Mr. Carswell has served on the Board of the Brooklyn Hospital Center and was a member of its Executive Committee and Chairman of the Board of the Brooklyn Hospital Foundation. The Board of Trustees and the entire Brooklyn Hospital family extend their deepest sympathy to the Carswell family.
