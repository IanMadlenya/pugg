        FRANKEL-G. David. Families, Board Members, Volunteers and Staff join together in tribute to our former Chapter President who for over 20 years gave of himself so that others would benefit from his leadership. He had the vision that CF would be cured and he fought so that children and adults would beat the odds and lead long healthy lives. He was the true volunteer-selfless and devoted. Doris F.
