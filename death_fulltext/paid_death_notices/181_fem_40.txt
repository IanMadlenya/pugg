        COLEMAN-Enid Anderson. Formerly of Bedford Village, NY, died peacefully Friday, February 1, at the age of 92. She was a dedicated, devoted and determined wife and mother: a discerning woman of searing intellect, who also made the best apple pie in the world. She lived through and for her family: her husband Randolph, her children Esther, John and Virginia, and her grandchildren. Those who survive her now feel her loss. Burial is private. Donations in her memory may be made to any animal welfare organization.
