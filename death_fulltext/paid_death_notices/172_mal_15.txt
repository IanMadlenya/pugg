        BENGUALID-Rachel. We extend our deepest sympathy to our Golden Founder and devoted friend Henri Bengualid on the loss of his beloved mother, a true Eishes Chayil. The kind and modest way in which Mr. Bengualid continues the family tradition of Tzedekah and Chesed is a lasting tribute to his mother.
