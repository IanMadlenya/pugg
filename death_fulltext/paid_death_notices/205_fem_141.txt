        LEVY--Joyce. July 22, 1927 to February 15, 2004, beloved aunt of Sondra Levy Wells. Mourned by cousins and friends at home and abroad. Joyce loved work, travel and the arts, most of all, people. She gave to many and will be missed by all.
        LEVY--Joyce. For over 30 years, Joyce has been our friend, our confidante, our travel guru and editor. The world was truly Joyce's neighborhood; and so many of us are better people for having known her. She will be deeply missed. Leila and Mickey Straus
