        ABELOFF-Abram, M.D. The Board of Trustees, Medical Staff and Department of Surgery of Lenox Hill Hospital express profound sorrow at the passing of our esteemed colleague, Abram Abeloff, M.D., a member of our Honorary Medical Staff. Dr. Abeloff, who joined our Department of Surgery in 1930, was a highly regarded and accomplished surgeon whose commitment to compassionate patient care was evident throughout his illustrious medical career at Lenox Hill Hospital, which spanned more than six decades. He completed his internship in surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in 1929. Dr. Abeloff served with distinction as a colonel in the U.S. Army, receiving the U.S. Army Legion of Merit. Dr. Abeloff also earned many professional honors and awards, including the Lenox Hill Hospital Distinguished Alumni Award in 1983. A respected and dedicated teacher, Dr. Abeloff served as a role model for generations of young physicians and was truly beloved by both his colleagues and his patients. The entire Lenox Hill Hospital family honors the memory of Dr. Abeloff, who exemplified the highest standards of the medical profession, and leaves a legacy of outstanding service and devotion to patient care. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Gertrude, a graduate of the Lenox Hill Hospital School of Nursing, his family and to all those fortunate enough to have known this special man. James S. Marcus, Chairman, Board of Trustees Gladys George, President and CEO Stephen A. Obstbaum, M.D., President, Medical Board Valavanur A. Subramanian, M.D., Director, Surgery
