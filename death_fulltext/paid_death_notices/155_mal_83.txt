        ATKINS-Thomas V., Ph.D. The Baruch College community mourns the death of our longtime colleague, Dr. Thomas V. Atkins. During his career at the college, Tom applied his intelligence, analytic skills and early recognition of the potential of the emerging information age to innovate a modern computer-driven library system for Baruch, and gave us the ability to support new frontiers of scholarship, education and teaching. His warmth, diplomacy and good nature earned him the affection and respect of his colleagues, co-workers, and a generation of students. We offer our sincere condolences to Janina, his wife. Sidney I. Lirtzman, President Baruch College
