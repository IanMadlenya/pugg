        DAVIS--Mary V., formerly of New Cumberland, Pennsylvania, died in New York on August 22, 2006. Mrs. Davis is survived by her sisters, Louisa Belski of Shamokin, Pennsylvania, and Margaret Arnold of Winchester, Virginia, her brother, Carman Minniti, also of Shamokin, and her son, James M. Davis, with whom she lived in New York since August 2005. Gerald F. Davis, her devoted husband, and brothers Charles and James Minniti are deceased. Mrs. Davis was born in Mount Carmel, Pennsylvania on May 15, 1922, the first of six children born to James and Margaret Minniti, who emigrated from Italy to Pennsylvania's eastern anthracite coal region at the turn of the century. In 1939, she graduated from St. Edward's High School in Shamoking, intend on a career in business at a healthy distance from the mines that would take her father's life, and the shirt factory where he had arranged for her to work. She moved to Harrisburg in the same year, taking secretarial positions in state and federal government. Marriage and motherhood were followed by administrative positions with a defense contractor and law firm that spanned fifty years. Along the way, she worked harder than most, saw to her son's education, and did what she had to do. She handled her illness and death of cancer in the manner of her life, with dignity and determination, and utterly without complaint.
