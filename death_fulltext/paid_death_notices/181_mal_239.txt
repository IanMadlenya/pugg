        ANDERSON-David E. David, who combined moral substance with matchless style, died Friday February 15, 2002 after a long illness. David brought creativity to diverse senior management positions in fields including recording and marketing where, as in his interaction with friends, he had a solution for any problem. His many admirers will remember him as an incomparably loving, giving friend. His generosity set an example we cannot hope to equal, but we will be the better for trying. David is survived by his sister Mary, his brothers Mike, Joe and Tom and nine nieces & nephews.
