        SIEGEL-Inez Kosseff. We mourn the loss of our beloved mother, sister and friend, who was an integral part of the Long Beach community for over 50 years. Her memories will live on through her four children, Caryn, Joy, BarriLynn and Frederic; her four grandchildren, Spencer, Courtney, Blake and Julia; her sisters and brother, Linda, Susan, Cheryl and Gary; her dear friend and father of her children, Howard, and all those who were fortunate to know and be touched by Inez. Her wonderful spirit, kindness and loving ways will be cherished forever. Inez fought a courageous battle with ovarian cancer for over five years and requested that all donations be made to ''The Ovarian Cancer Research Fund,'' 1 Pennsylvania Plaza, New York, NY 10119-0165. Services Sunday, 1:30 PM, at ''Gutterman's Inc.,'' 175 Long Beach Road, Rockville Centre, L.I.
