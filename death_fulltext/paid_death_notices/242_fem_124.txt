        ENLOE--Emma. Our beloved mother and grandmother, Emma Bonnadell Clibourn Enloe, aged 90, died peacefully at her home in New York City, surrounded by family and friends, on March 15, 2007. Mrs. Enloe was born on her family's farm in Cole County, Missouri, where she grew up before graduating from Jefferson City High School. She worked for many years in the Missouri State Department of Revenue and later as an administrator at Charles E. Still Hospital. Mrs. Enloe was an active member of the First Baptist Church and a regular participant in local Democratic politics. She was born August 21, 1916, near Russellville, Missouri, a daughter of Charles Adolph and Estella Clilbourn, who predeceased her, as did her sister Margaret Clilbourn Pealer and her brother James Clibourn. Mrs. Enloe leaves a daughter, Sharon E. Baum, and a son, David H. Enloe, both of Manhattan, where Mrs. Enloe lived and worked for over 40 rears after joining her children there. She is also survived by two sons-in law, Stephen H. Baum and Ronald Harte, as well as a grandson, Benjamin Clibourn Baum and his wife Heather Gaillard of Minneapolis, and a second grandson, Samuel David Baum, of Los Angeles. A private funeral service was held yesterday at the Church of the Resurrection in Manhattan, with interment in a local New York City Cemetery. Her spirit of strength and determination will be an inspiration to all of us for the rest of our lives. The family requests that any donations be made to the First Baptist Church of Jefferson City Missouri or to Ms. Trudy Lampert, I Love Animals, 136 East 64th Street, New York, NY 10021.
