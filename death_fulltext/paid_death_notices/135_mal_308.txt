        PAPAMARKOU-Alexander P. We at the Library of Congress are deeply saddened by the death of our esteemed friend and counselor Alecko Papamarkou. As a founding member of the Library's private-sector support group, the James Madison Council, he supported many important programs that have brought the unique resources of this institution to people everywhere. In honor of his grandfather, an eminent educator who brought the concept of public education to Greece, he established the Harissios Papamarkou Chair in Education at the Library of Congress, a position which will advance the Library's expanding role in education and in using electronic versions of the Library's collections in the nation's schools. He sponsored a special evening at the Library in October 1997 honoring the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople and was an imaginative and generous supporter of the Library's international outreach. We will miss Alecko's warmth, humor and keen wisdom. He was a rare friend and we are grateful that he allowed us to be a part of his life. James H. Billington The Librarian of Congress
        PAPAMARKOU-Alexander. New York University marks the passing of Alexander Papamarkou, philanthropist and international banker. He was a great friend to NYU and a staunch supporter of Hellenic studies. Mr. Papamarkou's gift of the Iris Papamarkou Library of Byzantine and Medieval Books to the Elmer Holmes Bobst Library was a lasting tribute to his late sister and a noteworthy addition to NYU.
