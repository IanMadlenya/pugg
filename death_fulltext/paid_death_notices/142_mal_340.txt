        KAPLAN-Lewis. The leadership and staff of UJA-Federation of New York in Westchester note with sorrow the passing of Lewis Kaplan, beloved husband of Lilly, father of Harriet Suvall and Dr. Ruth Treiber, father-in-law of Mark Suvall and Dr. Eric Treiber and grandfather of Jonathan, Adam, David and Cara. A retired officer of the NYC Police Department and a committed Jew, he leaves behind a good name and a legacy of heroic deeds. His wisdom, guidance and loving prescence will be sorely missed. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair James S. Tisch, President Stephen Solender, Executive Vice President Barry J. Effron, Chair Westchester General Campaign Martine Fleishman, Chair Westchester Women's Campaign Stephen G. Doochin, Director, Westchester Division
