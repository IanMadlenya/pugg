        SCHWARTZ--Philip K. The attorneys and staff of Davis & Gilbert LLP mourn the passing of our partner, mentor and friend Phil Schwartz. From the time he joined us in 1943 until his retirement several years ago, Phil extended to his colleagues and clients his extraordinary intellect, legal skills, judgment and persistence, offered good naturally and usually with a dose of humor. He was unceasing in his efforts on behalf of his clients often pushing fellow attorneys to consider novel approaches to troublesome problems. He was one of the principal architects of our firm and we shall be forever indebted to him. We offer our deepest sympathies to Phil's loving family and many devoted friends.
