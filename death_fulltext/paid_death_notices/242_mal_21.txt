        CAMPBELL--Charles J. The faculty of the department of Ophthalmology at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons with the staff of the E.S. Harkness Eye Institute of New York Presbyterian Hospital, deeply mourn the passing of this gifted physician-scientist, former Chairman of the Department and Executive Officer of the Eye Institute. Dr. Campbell was an acknowledged pioneer in the development of the first laser to be successfully employed in the treatment of ocular disease. After serving as a Captain in the United States Air Force, he completed his residency at the Eye Institute in 1957, while earning a Doctorate of Medical Science degree. His life long interest in optics led to his development of numerous optical instruments for the diagnosis of eye disease culminating in his design of the first ruby laser delivery system capable of treating a variety of retinal problems previously requiring invasive surgery. Joining the faculty of the department after residency, Dr. Campbell advanced rapidly through the academic ranks due to his remarkable research record, his teaching skills and his success as an ophthalmic diagnostician and surgeon. In 1974, he was appointed chairman of the department E.S. Harkness professor of Ophthalmology retiring as Emeritus professor in 1987. His legacy of dedicated service to the department and the Eye Institute, his vision saving technological achievements and his gentlemanly presence will be long remembered and cherished. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife Mary, children, Katherine M. Campbell, Barbara I. Campbell-Kopec, Charles A. Jr. III and his grandchildren. Stanley Chang, M.D. K. K. Tse and Ku Teh Ying Edward S. Harkness, Professor and Chairman
