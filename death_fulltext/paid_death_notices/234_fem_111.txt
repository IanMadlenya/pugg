        SEDLEY--Dina T. The officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Dina T. Sedley, who along with her late husband, Nathan, was a lifetime supporter of humanitarian and Jewish causes. This enduring legacy continues through the leadership of their son, Ronald, whose service to our Board of Directors and Commission on the Jewish People strengthens our ability to serve those in need. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Dina's children: Ronald, Rita Katz, Brenda Beeley, Madeline, and her husband, Leo Zern; to their grandchildren and greatgrandchildren; and to the entire family. Morris W. Offit, President Susan K. Stern, Chair of the Board John S. Ruskay, Exec. V.P. & C.E.O.
