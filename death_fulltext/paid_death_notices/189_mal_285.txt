        MORTOLA-Edward J. The Board of Trustees, Chairman Aniello A. Bianco, President David A. Caputo, the faculty, staff, students and alumni of Pace University express profound sorrow at the loss of Dr. Edward J. Mortola, Chancellor Emeritus and Former President of Pace University. Dr. Mortola's life was notable for his own accomplishments as well as for the influence he had on generations of Pace University students, faculty, staff and alumni. He served as president of Pace from 1960 to 1984 and chancellor from 1984 to 1987, leading Pace during its greatest period of academic and physical expansion and vastly increasing the University's size and scope. During his tenure as president, Dr. Mortola introduced the liberal arts degree programs to Pace and subsequently established a series of professional schools in nursing, education, continuing education and law. We remember him as a great innovator, builder, leader, and dominant force in higher education in New York City. We express our gratitude for his contributions to Pace as dean, vice president, president, chancellor and trustee during the course of his half a century affiliation with the university. We extend our sincere condolences to his wife, Doris, daughters Doreen Mortola LeMoult and Elaine Mortola-Clark, and his five beloved grandsons.
