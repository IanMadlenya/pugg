The American Friends of The Ghetto Fighters' Museum notes with sadness the passing of Leon Uris, a former Board member whose path-breaking literary work, Mila 18, helped bring to the world's attention the heroic struggle of the Warsaw Ghetto Resistance during the Holocaust. His connection with the surviving Jewish fighters and with the Ghetto Fighters' Museum in Israel resulted in his creation of a timeless book that has brought great inspiration to those who hold dear the values of humanity, tolerance, and an affirmation of Jewish life.
