        GLAZER--Dorothy. On September 14, 2003. A very loving and devoted wife of her late husband Lou with whom she shared a wonderful life. A caring and involved mom, grandma and great-grandma whose happiest times were those spent with her sister Nettie, her children Leni, Harold and Richard, her grandchildren Rori, Jonny, Dawn, David, Chasity, Glen, Adam and Bari, her great-grandchildren Philip, William, Ciro, David, Jeremy and Lauren. We are a lucky family to have had Dottie with us for 96 years. She will be missed and in our hearts always. We love you.
