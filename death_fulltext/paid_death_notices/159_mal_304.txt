        de ROTHSCHILD-Raphael. On April 22nd, 2000 at age 23 in New York. Adored son of Nili and Nathaniel de Rothschild, and adored brother of Esther de Rothschild. The most kind, thoughtful, intelligent, charming, compassionate human being that ever was, he blessed his parents, his sister and his family with the greatest love throughout his ever so short life, and touched all those fortunate enough to know him. Go in peace our Angel, you will always be in our hearts.
