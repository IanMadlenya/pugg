        FISCHLER-Sandra Zook. Beloved wife of William. Devoted mother of Sabrina Zook Brotman and Julianne Zook, adoring grandmother of Matthew and Alex Brotman, Gabriel and Daniel Fischler. Sandra participated in the NYC Marathon for many years and she proudly ran with a runner from the Achilles Club in her last marathon appearance. She was the first patient representative for the FDA for a period of five years and voted during her tenure to approve use of the two breast cancer fighting drugs, which ironically Sandra used in her own fight against cancer. Service at 11:45 A.M. today at ''The Riverside,'' 76th Street and Amsterdam Ave., NYC. Memorial contributions to SHARE at 1501 Broadway, New York, New York 10036, would be appreciated.
