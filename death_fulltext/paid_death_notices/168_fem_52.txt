        SULLER-Elsie. With deep sorrow the Camp Kinderland Board of Directors and generations of Kinderland staff, campers, and friends mourn the death of our beloved Director Emeritus, Elsie Suller. For many of us Elsie was Camp Kinderland and the progressive, secular Jewish values and traditions to which she devoted her life are her legacy. She touched hundreds of lives. We will carry on in her memory. A memorial is being planned for the spring.
