        MOORE-William J. The Fordham Law School community records with great sorrow the passing of William J. Moore, our Dean of Admissions for over 30 years. He brought great warmth, dignity, wise judgement and compassion to his work. His legacy is found in the lives of over 10,000 Fordham Law graduates who were admitted during his tenure. We extend our deep sympathy to his family. John D. Feerick, Dean
