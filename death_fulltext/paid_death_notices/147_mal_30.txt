        EISENBUD-Dr. Jule. The Board, staff and members of the American Society for Psychical Research mourn the passing of Dr. Jule Eisenbud. Dr. Eisenbud was an eminent psychiatrist, psychoanalyst and psychical researcher with the courage and vision to explore the uncharted realms of human experience. His ideas about the unconscious nature of psychic experiences were insightful and compelling, and will continue to illuminate the path of future research. His extraordinary intellect, insight and compassion will be deeply missed. He will not be forgotten. Patrice Keane, Executive Director American Society for Psychical Research
