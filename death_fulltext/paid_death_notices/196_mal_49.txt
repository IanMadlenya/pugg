        FEINER - Benjamin, died April 28 at age 91. He will be deeply missed by his children, Larry and Lisa Feiner; by his son-in-law and friend, Barry Commoner; by his brother, Isaac Feiner; by his nieces and nephews, Marc & Roberta Levine, Steve & Paul Brand, and Mauro Zulli; and by his aide and devoted friend, Indra Bisram. He was a strong, responsible, loving and generous man with a warmly sardonic sense of humor and a strong social conscience. He expressed that social conscience through his many years of work as an occupational health and safety engineer for the NYS Department of Labor, and through the chapters he contributed to a seminal work in the field, ''Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials.'' He was an unusually decent man who lived with grace and honor.
