        SHAPIRO--Alan Peter. He lived a life that gave joy and service to all who knew him. A devoted and loving husband, father, grandfather, brother, brother-in-law and an incomparable friend of ours. Our loss is beyond sadness, but we cherish over 75 years of wonderful memories. Never to be forgotten, Alan was unique. With all our love to all the family, Audrey and Dick
