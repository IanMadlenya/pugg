        SCHLUSSEL - Barbara. Adored wife of Sy Schlussel, M.D. for 49 years. Mother of her beloved son Ralph and sister of Herbert Simon. Passed away April 15. She was genuinely the most devoted loving mother, always selflessly willing to sacrifice and forego personal rewards in caring for her Ralph. For many years she raised funds for the Mental Retardation Facility at the New York Medical College and for more than 30 years arranged the pre-graduation dinner dance for the New York Medical College. She will be sorely missed but never forgotten. Friends may call at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81 Street, Tuesday and Wednesday 7-9PM with services Thursday 11:30AM. Interment private.
        SCHLUSSEL-Barbara. I note with deep regret the passing of Barbara. She has been, with her husband Sy, a significant supporter of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of New York Medical College. She was a warm, vibrant and generous woman. James R. Jones, M.D., Professor Emeritus
        SCHLUSSEL-Barbara. Distance does not lessen our feelings for loss of our dear friend. Our heartfelt sympathy to Sy, Ralph, and Herb. Mike and Karol Gordon
