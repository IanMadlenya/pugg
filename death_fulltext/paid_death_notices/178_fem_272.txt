        ARONSON-Iris. Stephen and Donna Leeb and Leeb Capital Management mourn the tragic death of Iris Sherry Aronson, administrative assistant and den mother extraordinaire. We were privileged to know her and will miss her daily. Her unassuming but astounding competence kept our lives in order, while her warmth, good humor and devotion nurtured us. Our deepest condolences to Jonathan, Ralph and Joyce.
