        PHILLIPS BEIRNE--Carol. Clinique Laboratories LLC and The Estee Lauder Companies, Inc., mourn the passing of Carol Phillips Beirne, Clinique's Founder and former Chairman, on March 1, 2006. Launched in 1968, Clinique became the first beauty brand to be guided by a dermatologist, as well as the first allergy-tested and fragrance free line ever marketed. Under Carol's guidance, it became the best-selling cosmetics brand in The United States, as well as in many of the approximately 130 countries around the world in which it is marketed. Carol retired in 1992. We extend our deepest sympathy to Carol's sister, Lucia Haile; her daughter Deirdre Beirne Brown; her granddaughter, Jennifer Morrell, and her two greatgranddaughters. Burial will be private. The family has requested that contributions in memory of Carol be made to: The Sag Harbor Historical Society, P.O. Box 1709, Sag Harbor, New York 11963; The John Jermain Memorial Library, P.O. Box 569, Sag Harbor, New York 11963, or The Breast Cancer Research Foundation, 60 East 56th Street, 8th Floor, New York, New York 10022.
