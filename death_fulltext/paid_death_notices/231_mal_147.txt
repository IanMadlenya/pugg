        JENNINGS--Evan D., II. The entire Avon Old Farms School community mourns the passing of our esteemed alumnus and Director, Evan Jennings. A member of the Class of 1939, Evan Jennings was intimately involved with the School throughout his life providing extraordinary vision, leadership, and support. Evan Jennings served as an active member of the Board of Directors from 1964 to 1983, and as an Honorary Director since then. In 1970 he lead the initiative to build a hockey rink at the School and established one of the finest school boy hockey programs in the country. His deep passion for the School, expressed over several decades, has helped position Avon Old Farms as one of America's great secondary schools. We join in extending heartfelt condolences to Evan's wonderful wife, Cynthia, and to his entire family. Rolf H. Olson '59 Chairman, Board of Directors Kenneth H. LaRocque Headmaster
