        FISHER-Zachary. The shareholders of 50 Sutton Place South Owners, Inc. mourn the passing of our friend and neighbor, a member of the Fisher Brothers Company, who was actively instrumental in the construction of 50 Sutton Place South, who helped assure the proper management of the building and who was a valued resident of the building from the time it was completed until the time of his death. We express our deepest condolences to his wife, Elizabeth, and to the entire Fisher family. The beauty of our building and the high quality of life in it are a fitting tribute to our former neighbor.

We extend our heartfelt condolences to the entire Fisher family. John F. McGillicuddy, President Richard M. Ruffino, Scout Executive
