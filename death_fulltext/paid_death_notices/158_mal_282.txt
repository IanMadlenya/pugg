        KLEMPERER-Peter. The management and staff of Greater New York Hospital Association deeply mourn the passing of Peter Klemperer. Peter was one of our most brilliant and trusted advisers on the full range of financial, reimbursement, and strategic issues facing the hospital community. He was also our valued friend. He thought and cared deeply about how to improve health care for all New Yorkers, but particularly the poor and uninsured, and his ideas and work have helped shape health care delivery in New York City. Peter was a gentle soul who was blessed with intellectual gifts that commanded the highest respect of his colleagues. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Judith, and children Jerusha and Ethan, and to our colleagues at the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, for the loss of this very special person. Gladys George, Esq., Chair Kenneth E. Raske, President Greater New York Hospital Assn
