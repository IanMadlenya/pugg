        SHEINKMAN -- Jack. The Board of Directors and Staff of the International Rescue Committee are saddened by the death of Jack Scheinkman, a valued member of our Board from 1964-2002. Jack was a tireless leader in the cause of international human rights and of refugees uprooted by oppressive dictatorships. He was a former President of the Jewish Labor Committee, which worked with the IRC during World War II to assist refugees fleeing the Nazis. We will miss Jack deeply and extend heartfelt sympathy to the family. Winston Lord James C. Strickler Co-Chairman John C. Whitehead Chairman Emeritus George Rupp President
