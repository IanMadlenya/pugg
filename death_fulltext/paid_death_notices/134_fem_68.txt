        BRENNER-Goldie. The Board of Directors and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Goldie Brenner, beloved mother of Edith Everett, a cherished philanthropist and humanitarian.

They are enormously admired and respected throughout the community for their extraordinary leadership, commitment and generosity on behalf of UJAFederation and many other organizations in New York, and throughout the world. We extend our deepest sympathies to Edith and Henry Everett; Mrs. Brenner's daughter, Gladys Praigrod; her grandchildren; and her greatgrandchildren. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair Louise B.
