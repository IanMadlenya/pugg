        BARNETT-Henry L., M.D. Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University mourns the loss of our Distinguished University Professor Emeritus of Pediatrics. He was an internationally renowned and beloved physician, a giant in the field of pediatrics who contributed mightily to the growth and development of our medical school, as the founding chairman of our Department of Pediatrics, from 1955 to 1970, and as Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs from 1970 to 1972. He will always be remembered for his kindness, compassion, and dedication to excellence and to the highest standards of the medical profession. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Shirley, to his children Martin and Judith, and to the entire family. Dominick P. Purpura, M.D. The Marilyn and Stanley M. Katz Dean Albert Einstein College of Medicine
