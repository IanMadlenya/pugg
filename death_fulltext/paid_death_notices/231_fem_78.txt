        KERNBERG--Paulina, M.D. Weill Medical College of Cornell University and New York-Presbyterian Hospital mourn the passing of our respected friend and colleague Dr. Paulina Kernberg, professor of psychiatry at Weill Cornell, and director of child and adolescent residency training and founder of the Children of Divorce program at Payne Whitney Westchester in White Plains. Dr. Kernberg was a noted authority on child psychiatry, particularly in the area of personality disorders, and her work helped challenge the conventional wisdom on the impact of divorce on children. Generations of faculty, staff and students were moved by her warmth, wisdom, clinical excellence and leadership. We are forever indebted to her for the outstanding contributions she made to our program and to our field. We extend our heartfelt condolences to her husband, Dr. Otto Kernberg, and her entire family. Dr. Antonio M. Gotto Dean Weill Cornell Medical College Dr. Herbert Pardes President and CEO NY-Presbyterian Hospital Dr. Jack D.
