        GRAUBART-Alexander, Rabbi. We mourn with profound sorrow the passing of our beloved colleague. He served pulpits in California and Chicago and as vice president of the University of Judaism in Los Angeles. For the past nine years, he was the chaplain at Evanston Hospital in the Chicago area. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Jean, sister Judy, children Amy Katz, Beth, Jonathan, Hadara, Eytan and our colleague Rabbi Philip Graubart and to all who were touched through this rabbinate. Rabbi Vernon H. Kurtz, Pres. Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Exec. VP The Rabbinical Assembly
