        OLSON-Barbara. The Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law of Yeshiva University mourns the tragic and untimely passing of Barbara Bracher Olson, 1989 Cardozo graduate who died in the terrible terrorist attack on the Pentagon. At CSL she was chapter president of the Federalist Society, then became chief counsel for the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee. She went on to be a commentator at CNN and an author. Her career was marked by integrity, courage, and infectious enthusiasm. Our sympathy is extended to her husband, parents, brother, and sister as well as the families of the many innocent victims of the horrible attack on our country. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University Earle I. Mack, Chairman, CSL Board of Directors Stewart Sterk, CSL Acting Dean
