        COTTON--Harvard A. 93, of Whitestone, NY, on December 19. Deeply mourned by his son Ross, his brother-inlaw and sister-in-law Bill and Betty Ruder and a warm and caring family of nieces, nephews and friends. Harvey was an extraordinary husband to his departed wife, Deborah, an inspiring high school math teacher in New York for over 35 years and a former President of Temple Hillel in Whitestone. His beautiful garden reflected a deep love of nature and sense of aesthetics. He conceived of, formed and managed S.H.I.P., the Supplemental Health Insurance Program for retired teachers that became a department of the UFT. We all will sorely miss him. Services are private.
