        LUSINS-John. The Confrerie des Chevaliers du Tastevin, SousCommanderie de New York and Commanderie d'Amerique, notes with sorrow the death of Dr. John O. Lusins, Delegue General Nordest. We express our condolences to his wife, Marie, his children and his grandchild. Dr. Lusins was a Grand Officier of the Confrerie, which he joined in 1986. He was a passionate lover of wine with an enormous knowledge of French and German wines in particular. The members of the Confrerie will sorely miss his friendship and support.
