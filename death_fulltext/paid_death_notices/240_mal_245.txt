        YELEN--George Rutherford, died on January 19th, 2007; he was 90. He enjoyed singing, dancing the khazatske, and drinking scotch on the rocks which, if possible, he would gladly do all at once. He loved a good meal and a good joke. He was a veteran of the U.S. Navy in WWII and Chairman of the Board of E. J. Korvettes. But his family gave him the most joy and the most pride. George was the loving husband of Helen Yelen for almost 70 years; the adoring father of Stephen Yelen (and wife Rosalie), William Yelen, and Charles Yelen (and wife Barbara); the doting grandfather of Jennifer Yelen, Elizabeth Weiss (and husband Daniel); Ariel Yelen and Joanna Yelen; and proud great-grandfather of Elijah Weiss. To all of them he was exceptionally devoted. His passing leaves a gaping hole in their lives and the lives of so many other relatives and friends.
