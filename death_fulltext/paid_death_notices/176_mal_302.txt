He was the loving and adored son of Linda and Buddy, cherished brother of Danny, devoted grandson of Rose Lerner, and beloved great-nephew, nephew, cousin, and friend to many. He will always be remembered for his love of life, wonderful sense of humor, warmth, and generosity. A celebration of Larry's life is to be held on Friday, September 21 at 2:00pm at Gutterman's Funeral Home, 8000 Jericho Turnpike, Woodbury, NY.
        POLATSCH-Laurence M. September 11, 2001. In celebration of our Laurence lovingly called a ''Winna Baby'' from day one. Our tears are eased by smiles at the thought of the special young man you've been. You and Danny, although different, were role models for brothers everywhere. As a son to our Linda and to Buddy you were compassionate and loving and all that a son should be. You're twinkling eyes have lit up the skies saying I'm ok, you be ok. Love you, Gram Mama Rose and Great Aunt Eleanor
        POLATSCH-Laurence. We were just getting to know you but we already loved that wild and crazy guy. We will miss not getting to know you better. Our sincere condolences and love to Linda, Bud and Danny. The Mann Family
