        EVANS-John Arthur, MD. The faculty and staff of the Department of Radiology at New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center mourn the passing of Dr. John Arthur Evans, former Professor and Chairman of Radiology and Radiologist-in-Chief from 1952 until his retirement in 1976. After his retirement he remained on staff as an Attending Radiologist and was active in the Department's post-graduate programs. During these two decades, the department expanded and differentiated, and its academic programs were strengthened. He was a pioneer and an influential leader in the field of radiology and taught and mentored a generation of future leaders. He was recognized for his accomplishments by numerous awards, which included the Gold Medal from the Radiological Society of North America in 1967. Dr. Evans served as a Chancellor of the American College of Radiology in 1953. He also served as President of the American Board of Radiology from 1967 to 1969 and was Chairman of the Residency Review Committee that organized the Board's first written exam. He will be remembered as an influential educator and pioneering radiologist who set the highest standards of professional conduct and patient care. We extend our condolences to his entire family. H. Dirk Sostman, MD Professor and Chairman Department of Radiology New York Presbyterian HospitalWeill Cornell Medical College
