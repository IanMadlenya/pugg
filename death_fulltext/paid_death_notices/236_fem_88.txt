        FALLACI--Oriana. Rizzoli International Publications mourns the death, on September 15, 2006, of a fearless and controversial writer. Born in Florence, Italy and politicized from a very early age by her anti-Fascist father, Oriana Fallaci began a career in journalism as a teenager, and often discussed her participation in the Resistance during WWII. As a war correspondent, Oriana Fallaci covered the greatest conflicts of her time including Hungary, Vietnam, Latin America, Mexico, the Middle East, and the Persian Gulf. Known for her piercing interviews with world leaders and celebrities, Oriana Fallaci's subjects included Henry Kissinger, the Ayatollah Khomeini, the Shah of Iran, Yasser Arafat, the Dalai Lama, Golda Meir, Indira Gandhi, Federico Fellini, and Walter Cronkite, among many others. Author of many works of fiction and non-fiction, Oriana Fallaci's last two books, ''The Rage and the Pride,'' and ''The Force of Reason,'' expressed her fury at what she defined as the post-9/11 failure by Europe and the United States to deal appropriately with Islamic Fundamentalism, a position that incited both considerable support and lawsuits accusing her of racism. Ill for over ten years, Oriana Fallaci fought her brutal disease with the same fierce passion that defined her as a woman, and as a journalist and author.
