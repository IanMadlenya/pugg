        BARRETTO--Ray. It is with deep regret and sadness that the family of the legendary Ray Barretto announces that the acclaimed Conga Maestro died Friday, February 17, 2006. Mr. Barretto died at the Hackensack University Medical Center in Hackensack, NJ at 5 AM EST. His family was at his bedside. A leading force in both the Salsa and Latin Jazz worlds, Ray was one of the most prolific, influential and recorded Latin percussionists in the history of jazz and a pioneer in the world of salsa. His salsa aficionados and fans are represented throughout the world. The man popularly known as ''Hard Hands'' (Manos Duras) was raised in East Harlem and the Bronx, but was enthralled by the big band sounds of Duke Ellington, Glenn Miller and Tommy Dorsey. During his military tour through Europe, the musical influence of Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie claimed his attention at a GI jazz club. His world and his eventual global impact were never quite the same again. Just this past January, he received a most prestigious award from the National Endowment for the Arts for his legendary contributions to jazz. This is the highest honor that our nation bestows upon jazz musicians in recognition that this magnificent art form, so profoundly based in American culture, is one of America's greatest gifts to the world. Mr. Barretto is survived by his wife, Annette, their son, Chris (age 20), and Raun, Ray and Kelly from a former marriage. A public viewing will be held Wednesday, February 22nd, from 11 AM to 5 PM, 6 PM to 10 PM, at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 76th St. and Amsterdam Ave.
