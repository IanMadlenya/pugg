        ARMSTRONG-J. Sinclair. We are saddened by the loss, but exhilarated by the life. As Senior Warden, Sinc led St. Mark's Church inthe-Bowery through a tumult of community and cultural change. As our first president, he championed the rebuilding of the fire devastated landmark church by a cadre of neighborhood youth. In all of this, he acted with unmatched courage, courtesy and good cheer. Sinc knew always how to assure that others were safe at sea. Peace and love to Charlotte, his family and friends. Trustees, St. Mark's Historic Landmark Fund
