        MALKIN-Roger. The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art note with sorrow the passing of Roger Malkin, who, along with his companion, Barbara Jakobson, generously supported so many of the Museum's programs, from The Department of Architecture and Design and the Museum's Library and Archives to the Department of Painting and Sculpture, and our expansion and renovation project. We extend our sympathies to his family and to Barbara. His warmth and intelligence will be missed. Ronald S. Lauder, Chairman Agnes Gund, President Glenn D. Lowry, Director The Museum of Modern Art, NY
