        LAZARUS--Maurice. Public Agenda sends its deepest condolences to Nell and her family. For its first 25 years, we benefited from Mogie's guidance and unwavering commitment as well as his wry humor, grace, and brilliant leadership. We will honor his memory by continuing the work he championed.
