        STANTON-Helen LaFetra. The Trustees and staff of the Mary Flagler Cary Charitable Trust mourn the loss of our friend and former colleague, Helen Stanton, who served as a Trustee from the Trust's founding in 1968 until her retirement in 1985. Helen Stanton and Mrs. Cary were close friends from early childhood and they shared many interests, particularly in the musical life of New York City. Helen was steadfast in her devotion to music and to the training of young musicians. Her memory serves to remind us of the highest standards of public service and friendship.
