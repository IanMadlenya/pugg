        BENCHLEY--Peter. On behalf of the trustees and staff of Environmental Defense, it is with great sadness that we note the passing of Environmental Defense supporter Peter Benchley on February 11. Peter was a passionate, powerful, advocate for the Oceans. Generous with his time and an engaging, entertaining speaker, Peter was the ideal ambassador for Environmental Defense's ocean conservation work. We remember with great appreciation his service on the National Council, the public events he headlined, and, more recently, the opinion pieces he co-authored with Environmental Defense calling on America to view her oceans as the national treasure they are, protecting them in the same way we have protected our great treasures on land in National Parks. His dedication, energy and sense humor were an inspiration. We will miss him greatly and extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Wendy, and their children and grandchildren. Fred Krupp, President Environmental Defense N.J. Nicholas, Jr. Chairman of the Board, Environmental Defense
