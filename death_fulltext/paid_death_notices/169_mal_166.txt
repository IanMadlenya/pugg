        TILOVE-Robert. On February 9, 2001, at age 86 in Mitchellville, Md. He was a beloved colleague from 1949 to his retirement in 1979, and then as a consultant to our company. Bob's creativity in pension plan design and his analysis of the economic effects of private and public pension funds broke new ground in a highly complex field. We were most fortunate to have been associated with him and send our deepest sympathy to his family. Martin E. Segal, Founder and Chairman Emeritus Robert D. Krinsky, Chairman Howard Fluhr, President, The Segal Company
