        MEYERS--Donald. The Board of Directors and staff of Care for the Homeless mourn the loss of our esteemed Board Member Emeritus, Donald Meyers. Donald held faculty appointments in graduate health care administration programs of several universities in New York. We knew Donald best as one who generously shared his expertise, graciousness and wise counsel in countless ways to help our agency fulfill its mission of delivering health care and social services to homeless men, women and children in New York City. In recognition of Donald's invaluable service, he was awarded Care for the Homeless' inaugural Lifetime Achievement Award. We will miss Donald, not only for his greatness, but also for his genuine goodness, which we were privileged to experience. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife Sue, his daughters, and to all his famlily and friends. Kent Wakeford, President Susan L. Neibacher, Exec Dir Care for the Homeless
