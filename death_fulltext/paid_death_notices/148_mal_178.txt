Beloved and cherished husband of Evelyn, adored father of Nancy and Norman, grandfather of Morgun and William. Harold was a devoted son, husband and father, who used his gifts of uncommon wisdom, compassion and insight to inspire and improve the lives of many who knew him. He rose to meet the many challenges in his own life with indefatigable determination, a clarity of purpose and an abundance of humor. We will miss him. Services today in San Diego, CA.
