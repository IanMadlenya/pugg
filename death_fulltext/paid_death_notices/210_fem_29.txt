        WINAGLE--Hope Estin, on July 4th at age 78. Mrs. Winagle died in Vero Beach, FL after a short illness. She leaves her devoted husband of 22 years, Gordon T. Winagle, of Vero Beach, four children by her first husband, Peter G. Estin, who predeceased her: Lee Estin Cauro of Barcelona, Spain, Timothy Estin of New York City, Heidi Estine Wade of Carbondale, CO and William Estin of Sao Paulo, Brazil, and six grandchildren, Peter Cauro, Xavier Cauro, Felix Cauro and Nicola Cauro, and Kelly Wade and Ali Wade. Mrs. Winagle is also survived by her two stepsons Jeffrey T. Winagle and James Lee Winagle, her brother Fred S. Wonham of Vero Beach, and countless nephews, nieces, cousins and friends. Mrs. Winagle was born in New York City in 1926 to Mary Knight Lincoln Wonham and W. Stapley Wonham, both now deceased, of Greenwich, CT. She attended Greenwich Academy in Greenwich, CT and graduated from Miss Porter's School, Farmington, CT in 1944. After years of a love of skiing, Mrs. Winagle became an ardent blue water sailor with her second husband, and a lover of Cavalier King Charles spaniels, particularly two. A memorial service will be held for the family this fall in Vero Beach. Instead of flowers, Mrs. Winagle suggested that contributions be considered to the Humane Society of Vero Beach, PO Box 644, Vero Beach, FL. 32961.
