        COSLOY BLANK-Sharon, 56, the perfect daughter, wife, mother and friend passed peacefully with her family by her side on September 2. She will be missed and loved forever by husband, Edward Blank; children Rebecca and Michael; mother Florece Cosloy and brother and sister-in-law Barry and Sherry Cosloy. After growing up in Paterson, NJ, Sharon graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Elmira College and received a doctoral degree from NYU at a time when relatively few women were in Science. Sharon was a respected member of the CCNY Biology faculty for 27 years and served as Chair of the Biology Department for six. A passionate scientist, professor and mentor. Sharon was dedicated to both her research and her students. A lover of life, she enjoyed going to the theater, traveling and bringing friends and family together with great cooking. Because of her courage to battle and endure her illness while still enjoying life she was and continues to be an inspiration to her family. Services are on Wednesday 11:30AM at ''Plaza Jewish Community Chapel'', 91st Street and Amsterdam Avenue.
