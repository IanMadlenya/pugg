        SUGRUE--Albert ''Bud''. We mourn the loss of Bud Sugrue who was the leader of the facility team at our congregation. Bud loved life and touched the lives of all of us at Congregation B'nai Yisrael, young and old alike. His spirit will be profoundly missed. We share our loss with his wife, Sharon, sons, James, Robert and John Joel Dworetzky, President Rabbi Douglas E. Krantz Rabbi Seth M. Limmer Cantor Hayley Kobilinsky
