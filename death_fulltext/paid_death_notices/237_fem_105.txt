Retiring in 2001, Carol had held executive positions in marketing and communications with American Express and Citigroup. She was a consummate professional who maintained her spirit, humor and budget. Carol attended Skidmore College, held a BA in Education from University of South Florida and an MA in Marketing Communications from Hunter College. Carol is survived by her husband Michel Goldberg; her children, John Tsavaris and Tia Davidovici; mother Frances Theodos; brother Harry Theodos; granddaughter Brigette Davidovici, and stepchildren, Claude - Danielle Goldberg Badger and YvesGerard Goldberg.
