        STORCH-Marcia M.D. Died November 9, 1998 of ovarian cancer, in Tenants Harbor, Maine, cared for by her beloved partner Jeanne Hewitt. For a generation of women, via her practice and her public, TV and radio appearances, she destroyed myth and introduced dignity and openness into the GYN treatment room. She remained to the very end an always-current repository of medical research, practice and referral. In addition to Jeannie, she is survived by hundreds, if not thousands, of friends and former patients who survived because of her. We grieve. Edie Windsor and Thea Spyer
