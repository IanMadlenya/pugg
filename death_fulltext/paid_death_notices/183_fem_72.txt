        GOLDMAN-Judith. The Boys Town Jerusalem Family mourns the untimely passing of Judith Goldman, daughter of the late Gertrude and Moses Hornstein. Under the guidance of Moses, who served as Chairman of the school's Building Committee, and with the Hornsteins' generous support, the Boys Town dream was transformed into a reality as a tract of barren land was developed into a magnificent 18-acre campus. We extend heartfelt condolences to her beloved husband, Eugene, and the entire Goldman and Hornstein families. Michael Scharf, President Raphael Benaroya, Chairman Josh Weston, Honorary Chairman Rabbi Moshe Linchner, Dean Rabbi Ronald L. Gray, Exec. V.P.
