        PURPURA--Charles. New York University's Tisch School of the Arts and the Rita and Burton Goldberg Department of Dramatic Writing deeply mourn the death of Charles Purpura, a renowned screenwriter and a beloved teacher of screenwriting. An outstanding mentor to undergraduate and graduate students, Professor Purpura was a brilliant story analyst and an inspirational educator whose classes, always over-registered, brimmed with wit and wisdom. He wrote the screenplay for ''Heaven Help Us'' and scripts for ABC, Disney, Universal, Warner Bros, and Sidney Pollack Productions. His screenwriting awards include an Emmy and a Humanitas award. Our heartfelt condolences to his wife Jennie, son William, brother Pete and sister Carole.
