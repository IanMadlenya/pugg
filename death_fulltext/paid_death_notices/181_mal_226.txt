        GARDNER-John W. John Gardner's mark on Carnegie Corporation of New York, where he served as president from 1955 to 1965, is indelible. He arrived at the foundation after his service in WWII, imbued with the optimistic American spirit that this country's values could help transform a world wracked by war. He believed in the power of ideas and in the determination of man to change. Gardner shared our founder Andrew Carnegie's unwavering passion for the mission he established for our institution, that ''the advancement and the fusion of knowledge and understanding'' could ''do real and permanent good'' in the world. Like Carnegie, Gardner believed the greatest evil of all is ignorance. The board of trustees of the Corporation, its staff, both present and past, are thankful for John Gardner's service, leadership and legacy. Vartan Gregorian, President, Carnegie Corporation of New York
