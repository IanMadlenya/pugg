        GROSS-Milton S., December 11, 1918-November 5, 2000. Long-time New York City high school teacher, dedicated teacher's union member, and Oberlin College graduate, Milton S. Gross, died peacefully at home in Berkeley, California, following a short illness. He was committed to civil rights, social and economic justice, and world peace. He was a faithful reader of the New York Times and always read the obituary page. His mother, Kathinka, was a great strudel maker. His father, Ernest, was a furrier and as a youth, a traveler and a pool shark. Milton loved books, good food, travel, the women in his life, his family, and friends. He could tell a story with the best of them, always delivered with zest and enthusiasm. He charmed us with his full-throated renditions of Hungarian songs. He is survived by his four children, Toni Gross of Oakland, California; Joe Gross of Berkeley, California; Billy Gross of Copenhagen, Denmark; and Judy Weisman of Plattsburg, New York; eight grandchildren, Jeanette, Kate, Lucia, Mickey, Gabe, Jazbo, Spencer, and Dana; one greatgrandchild, Damani, and two nephews and one niece, Ken, Larry, and Katherine Gross. He was a man well loved by all that knew him. Graveside services will be held at the Beth El Memorial Gardens in Portland, Maine, on November 10, 2000, at 11:00 AM. Milton requested that donations be directed to an organization that he supported: RESIST, 259 Elm Street, Somerville, MA 02144, Phone (617) 623-5110.
