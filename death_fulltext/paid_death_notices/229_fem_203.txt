        SILVERMAN--Bessie. Longtime Manhattanite. Born in Vilna, died February 22, 2006 at the age of 98. Her liveliness, her delight in reading, and her passion for the New York Yankees will be muched missed by her sons Kenneth and Alexander; her grandchildren Willa and Ethan; her great grandchildren Benjamin, Eve and Isaac; her niece June and nephew Stanley; and by the others dear to them and to her: Michael Berkman, Jess Kasowitz, Jane Mallison, Bella Pilosov, and Ronit Silverman. May she now rest in peace.
