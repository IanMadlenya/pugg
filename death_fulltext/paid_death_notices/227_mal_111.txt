        WILLIAMS--Melvin Thurston 1935-2005 died peacefully at home, surrounded by his wife and three children, on Friday, December 2 after an eightmonth battle with lung cancer. Born on March 20, 1935, Mel was the son of the late Allton Thomas and Dorothea Danver Williams of Darien, Connecticut. Two brothers predeceased him, but he is survived by his sister, Lois Williams Adams of Milford, Connecticut.

He was involved in domestic and international production and retired, at the age of fifty-seven , as Vice President of Operations in 1992.
