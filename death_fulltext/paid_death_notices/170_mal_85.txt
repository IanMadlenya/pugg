        COHEN-Gerald, Ph.D. died suddenly on March 7, 2001. Professor of neurology and neurobiology at The Mount Sinai School of Medicine in N.Y.C. Loving and devoted husband of Dorothy; loving, devoted and proud father of Kevin. As a person, family and friends were first and foremost; for them he would leap tall buildings in a single bound. As an incredible scientist nonpareil, he would go where no scientist had gone before.
        COHEN-Gerald, Ph.D. Distinguished neuroscientist, member of our Scientific Advisory Board who has contributed greatly to Parkinson's Disease research. Heartfelt condolences to his wife, Dorothy, and son Kevin. Meldin D. Yahr, MD President International Federation of Parkinson's Disease Societies
