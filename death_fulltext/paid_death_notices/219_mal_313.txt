        ADAMS--Mason. Born Mason Abrams in Brooklyn. Decided to be an actor at age twelve and was successful on radio, television, stage and the film. He is survived by his wife Margot Weinberg and their children Betsy and Bill. His brother Herbert Abrams, a professor of radiology at Stanford University, together with his son and daughter, their grandchildren and two great-grandchildren are living, as are his brother-in-law, Irving Mauss and his sister's son, daughter and granddaughter. To all of us he represented the finest in actingskilled, brilliant, passionate. Words, visual images, speech, drama, antidotes and laughter - booming, hardy laughter at his own jokes and those of others, at the ironies and absurdities of life, were Mason's hallmarks. Towards the end when illness savaged him, he was only partly the Mason we knew. Even then great flashes of the real Mason shown as his mental and physical strength ebbed.
        ADAMS--Mason. The curtain has fallen. For all of us who loved and admired you, your star will continue to shine. We will miss you and never forget you. The years we shared will always be treasured by all the Donnenfelds.
