        LORD--Herbert. The partners of Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP mourn the passing of our beloved colleague Herbert Lord. Mr. Lord was born in Rockland, Maine on October 9, 1917. He graduated from Bowdoin College and Harvard Law School and was admitted to the bar in 1942. Mr. Lord rose to prominence as one of the pre-eminent admiralty lawyers in the United States and for years was a name partner in the firm of Burlingham, Underwood and Lord. He was a president of the Maritime Law Association and advised various countries on the formation of their maritime law codes. Mr. Lord joined Curtis, MalletPrevost in 1992 as a partner, establishing the Firm's admiralty department. He was a vibrant and active practitioner until his death at the age of 88. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife Martha and his sons John and Kenneth.
