        BARKHAM-Margot. Died on February 12 in Sarasota. Survived by her sister Pauline Forbath of Philadelphia, her brother Physil Buirski of Hallandale and her brother Abe Buirski of London and her children Jennifer and Graham and her grandchildren Scott, Phoebe, Elliott and David. She was born on the Cape Flats in South Africa in 1909. Following her husband John Barkham, in 1946 she emigrated from South Africa to New York with two young children and her mother. Although fiercely proud of her American citizenship since 1951, she remained connected to her motherland all her adult life through a business in Pretoria which she operated with her brother and her concern for South Africa's political future as a democratic state. An early feminist, she worked nearly her entire life, serving as a role model for the women in her family who followed her.
