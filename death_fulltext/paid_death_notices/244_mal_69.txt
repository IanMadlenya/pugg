        JENNY--Morris. A year ago God saw that you were getting tired and the cure was not to be. He put his arms around you and whispered, ''come with me''. A golden heart stopped beating, hard working hands at rest. God broke our hearts to prove to us He only takes the very best. We will never stop missing you. Loving wife Gail, sons Charles and Robert and the entire Jenny and Gershfamily.
