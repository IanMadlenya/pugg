        MODELL-Michael S. On April 28, 2001, our precious, beloved son Michael lost his battle against Crohn's disease & cancer. On this, the anniversary of his death, the entire Modell family laments his tragic and untimely passing with profound sorrow. He was our talisman of hope, our wellspring of joy, our touchstone of wisdom & strength. His legacy of courage, compassion, laughter and love will live in our hearts forever. His extraordinary integrity and countless acts of loving kindness will guide us as we honor his memory each day of our lives. Like a glorious shooting star, Michael blazed across the heavens showering us with his luminous beauty. His passing has left us in anguish, bereft of the angel we cherished and loved. This day, as we light a candle for a loving husband, a devoted father, a supportive brother, a doting uncle, & an adoring son, we echo his dying words and say, Michael of blessed memory, we will love you always. The Modell Family: Shelby and Bill; Abby, Alex, Andrew, Ashley; Leslie, Shawn; Mitchell, Robin, Melissa, Brittany, Baby Ashley and Matthew.
