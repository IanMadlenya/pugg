        JOSEPH--Saul M. On Friday, December 10, 2004, husband of Marcia, father of Michael, Hillary and Randie, father-inlaw of Kim, grandfather of Killie and Jack. Saul was a Senior Managing Director of GVA Williams, and a well liked and respected member of the Williams family for 53 years. We are thankful for the love and attention his own family gave Saul. This and his pride of his son Michael's success in his real estate career were able to offset much of Saul's discomfort. The Williams Family
