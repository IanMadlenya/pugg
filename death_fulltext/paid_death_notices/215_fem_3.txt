        JONES--Hilary. It is with deepest sympathy that the faculty, staff, students and alumni of Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health offer condolences to a most treasured faculty member, Judith Jones, and her husband, Madison, on the passing of their beloved daughter, Hilary. Hilary was a remarkable young woman, with an engaging personality, great intelligence, and many interests and talents. She was also an accomplished and enthusiastic horsewoman. She was a successful professional, holding senior management positions in government, corporate and academic sectors. Words can do little to alleviate the immense grief and sadness at this time, but we hope that the love and support of colleagues, friends and family will provide some comfort.
