        MAY-Samuel D. The Officers, Board of Directors and staff of UJA-Federation mourn the passing of Samuel D. May, beloved father of Peter May, an outstanding leader of UJA-Federation and very generous philanthropist who was instrumental in rescuing hundreds of thousands of Jews from the former Soviet Union as Chair of our Passage to Freedom and Operation Exodus Campaigns. Peter and his wife, Leni, have earned admiration and respect for their dedicated leadership and tireless efforts on behalf of the Jewish community. Our deepest sympathies go to Samuel's wife, Isabel; his son and daughter-in-law, Peter and Leni; his daughter and son-inlaw, Linda and Stephen Sklar; his grandchildren, Jonathan, Leslie, Caryn, Marci, and Kenneth; and great-grandchildren, Jacob, Alison, and Carlee. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair Louise B. Greilsheimer, President Stephen D. Solender, Exec. V.P.
