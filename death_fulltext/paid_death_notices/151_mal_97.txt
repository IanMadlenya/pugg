        HALLIDAY-Robert W. The Directors, representatives, and staff of the HRC companies mourn the sudden passing of our founder and president, Robert Halliday. For many years a tenured professor of chemistry at Adelphi University, he later built a successful financial planning firm addressing the needs of educators and their families. Bob was a man of unusual intellectual talent and vision. In all matters he conducted himself with great dignity, integrity and veracity. He will be sorely missed by those of us who knew him as both employer and friend. We extend our profoundest condolences to his wife Sarah, daughters Rachel and Melissa, son Andrew, and their families.
        HALLIDAY-Robert W. Dear friend and mentor, your wisdom and guidance were a source of personal inspiration, your warmth and generosity a hallmark of your personality. We will miss you always. Our sincerest condolences to Bob's loving wife Sarah, his devoted children Rachel (James), Andrew (Sarah), and Melissa, and his adoring grandchildren Rebecca, Devon and Lucas. Mr. and Mrs. Dean C. DiMaggio and Family
