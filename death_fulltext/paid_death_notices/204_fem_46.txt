        HOWARD--Fay, died peacefully looking out over the Bay of Cannes at the age of 81 on December 16, 2003, in Cannes, France. Growing up Jewish in Nazi Germany she survived unspeakable horrors living in Berlin during the war and yet was always unfailingly kind, constantly optimistic and positive, as well as supportive of her friends and family. She was never judgmental, always smart and insightful. She was a woman of substance. She was an infinitely warm and radiant presence, whose goodness and wit will be missed enormously by all those whose lives she touched. Her greatest legacy was the gift of undiluted sweetness and thoughtfulness that was her. She leaves behind her husband, Fred; her children, Ron and John Howard; four grandchildren, Ali, Zach, Eliza and Molly Howard; her companion, Jean Pierre Cabras, and her poodle, ''Ginnie.''
        HOWARD--Fay. My dear friend of 25 years, I hold with me the memory of a woman of profound substance, whose innate intelligence, humor and insight were always there for me and for anyone who was lucky enough to be in her orbit. Fay's priorities were always clear; she wanted harmony for those around her and she understood instinctively that harmony is the blending of many voices. She was, is and will always be, my Mother Emeritus. I will miss her forever and carry her with me always. I love you, Mom. Lauren Howard
