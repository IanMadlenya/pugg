        ZBOROWSKI -- Diana. The Yeshiva University family mourns the passing of a Jewish community leader and passionate supporter of Holocaust education. An elegant, modest and gracious woman, she and husband Eli, both Polish Holocaust surivors, established the Eli and Diana Zborowski Professional Chair in Interdisciplinary Holocaust Studies at Yeshiva University, the first academic chair in that field in the US. Through their involvement in the American and International Societies for Yad Vashem and the American Federation of Jewish Fighters, Camp Inmates and Nazi Victims, they led the campaign to ensure the Holocaust is not forgotten. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Eli, daughter Lillian, son Murry, and their families. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel President Norman Lamm, Chancellor Morry J. Weiss, Chairman Board of Trustees
