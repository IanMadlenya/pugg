        GREENE-Patricia, R.N., PhD. The Leukemia Society of America mourns the loss of Trish Greene. Since joining the Society in 1996 as Sr. Vice President, Patient Services, she contributed in major ways to the advancement of the Society's mission. She was a guiding force in the development of the Society's Patient Services Program, including: the Back to School Initiative, which helps children adjust when they return to school after treatment; First Connections, which links newly diagnosed patients with a peer volunteer; and the Information Resource Center. Trish made a positive impact on the lives of many people and those of us who knew and worked with her will greatly miss a fine professional and a warm, caring, and generous human being.

Our heartfelt condolences to her companion David Lingren, her father, Joel and her sisters Terry and Janet.
