        GO-Linda Maria, MD. Friends and colleagues in the Department of Medicine of Bronx Lebanon hospital Center are deeply saddened by the death of Maria Linda Go, MD. A graduate of our Medical Residency program and a member of our Division of General Medicine, she chose a career caring for the medically underserved and disadvantaged. Dr. Go exemplified caring, rigor, compassion, generosity, excellence and courage. Anyone would have been lucky to have her for a Doctor. We were lucky that she was our friend. We send our condolences to her family.
