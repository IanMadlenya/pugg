        MARTINEZ-Julio. By his life, Julio Martinez has set an example for all of us of how to advocate for the poor, the addicted and the disenfranchised. His voice may be silent, but his example will never be forgotten. Sincere condolences to his wife Judy and to the Martinez family. Father Coleman Costello Executive Director, Walk the Walk
