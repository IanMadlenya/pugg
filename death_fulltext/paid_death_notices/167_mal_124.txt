        GORMAN-Jack. The Three Arrows Cooperative Society mourns the loss of Jack Gorman, gentle, generous, beloved founding member. Memories of his intense and tireless efforts on behalf of our community will always be cherished. We extend condolences to his daughters Deborah, Susan and Judith, son-in-law Leonard Grob, granddaughters Erika, Jane, Merida and his great grandchildren. A memorial service will be held in the late Spring. Three Arrows Coop Society Halona W. Balgley, President
