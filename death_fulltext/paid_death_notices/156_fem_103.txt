        RAPP-Lina. We extend our sincerest condolences to Bertie Tryfus, Jenny Goldfrank, Karen Ehrenreich, Steven Tryfus and Mark Tryfus on the loss of their beloved mother, sister and grandmother. Throughout her life Mrs. Rapp exemplified the values of kindness, modesty and dignity, and was a true ''woman of valor''. Founders of the Medical Center, Bertie and Fred Tryfus personify the most profound values of Jewish tradition that they learned from this special woman. May the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Amer. Comm. for Shaare Zedek Med. Ctr. in Jerusalem Erica Jesselson, Chair Menno Ratzker, Pres.
