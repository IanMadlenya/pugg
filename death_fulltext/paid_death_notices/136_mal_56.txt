        BASH-Hazzan Saul. The Cantors Assembly records with sorrow the passing of a respected colleague of over four decades. Quietly and gently he served the spiritual needs of his congregants with great dignity, warmth, and care. We extend our sympathy to his children, and his loved ones. May his memory abide as a blessing. Hazzan Henry Rosenblum, President Hazzan Abraham B. Shapiro, Executive Administrator
