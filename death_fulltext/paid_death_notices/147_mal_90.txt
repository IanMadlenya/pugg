        SELLERS-Brother John. Alvin Ailey Dance Theater Foundation mourns with profound sadness, the loss of Brother John Sellers. His unique sound was an inspiration to Alvin Ailey and thousands of fans who enjoyed his singing both along side the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and and as a solo gospel and blues artist. Mr. Sellers' inimitably throaty voice, fascinating stories and wonderful sense of humor will be greatly missed by all the artists and staff who worked with him at the Alvin Ailey Dance Theater Foundation.
