        DRACHMAN-Roy P. The International Council of Shopping Centers, its trustees, staff, and 40,000 members worldwide mourn the passing of our beloved founding member, past Chairman 1960-1963, Member of the Board of the ICSC Educational Foundation, and industry pioneer. Innovator in a wide range of areas including parking, Roy P. Drachman was a man of great intellectual curiousity able to take the big risk when the opportunity arose. His generosity is legendary and virtually every aspect of his home town, Tucson, Arizona has been touched by his philanthropy. He was also a Stalwart Champion and benefactor of the University of Arizona. His greatest gift was that of his friendship, open full and enthusiastic. ICSC members who knew him or of him will always remember his quick wit and helping hand. Michael Kercheval, President John Riordan, Vice Chaiman International Council of Shopping Centers
