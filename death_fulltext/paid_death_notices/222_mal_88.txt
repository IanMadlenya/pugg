        NENNER--Rafael, M.D. The Zankel family--Arthur, Judy, Kenny, Tommy, Mark and Jimmy--wishes to express its most sincere condolences to the entire Nenner family. Ray was a special man--lovely, sweet, kind, funny, smart. He fought to live from his earliest to latest days. He was a real trouper. Life will never be quite the same without him. He will be sorely missed.
