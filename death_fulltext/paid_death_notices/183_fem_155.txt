        PAOLOZZI-Countess Alicia. The National Council of Women of the United States and the eighty-one National Councils which make up the International Council of Women are deeply saddened by the death of an exceptional woman who worked long and devotedly to make the world a better place for women and their families everywhere. All age groups were part of her constituency-from the very young to the aged. Born to a world of great privilege, she both understood and vowed to change the harsh realities which rendered so many lives without hope. She worked tirelessly, inventively and with great respect for those less fortunate than she. Her generosity was equalled by her total committment to the United Nations and values which served as a beacon in a dark world. She was a role model throughout her long productive life and leaves a legacy which will continue to be an inspiration to all whose lives she touched.
