        ROSEDALE -- Herbert. The partners, counsel, associates and staff of Jenkins and Gilchrist Parker Chapin deeply mourn the passing of our beloved and esteemed partner, Herbert Rosedale. In addition to providing the firms' clients with exemplary service for more than 46 years, Herb was an attorney whose deep compassion for others drove him to devote countless hours of pro bono service to victims of cults. Although he will be sorely missed, his legacy will live on through the many young attorneys he mentored over the years in whom he instilled the values that endeared him to his partners, his clients and all who had the privilege of knowing him. We extend our sincerest condolences to his wife, Ethel, and his entire family. Services will be held on Thursday, November 6th at 1:00 PM at Temple Beth El of Northern Westchester.
