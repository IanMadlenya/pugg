        KRAUSS-Evelyn. Loving mother, loving friend, she meant the world to all of us and we will miss her dearly. She died April 8, 1999, much as she lived-with courage and spirit in the comfort of her home and with her family. Devoted wife of the late George G. Krauss, she is survived by her daughters, Stephanie Farrell and Georgette Krauss; her grandchildren, Deirdre and Stephen Farrell; her son-in-law, Paul Farrell. Service was held in her memory at the Branch Funeral Home in Smithtown, NY.
        KRAUSS-Evelyn. Farewell dear friend. Edith Haydu, Daughters Lee, Pat, Cindy, Granddaughters Jessica, Nancy and Grandsons.
