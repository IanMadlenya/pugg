        MARGOLIS-Dr. Benjamin. It is with profound sadness that the Board of Directors, students and faculty of the Mid-Manhattan Institute for Psychoanalysis mourn the death of a pioneer of Modern Psychoanalysis, Dr. Benjamin David Margolis. He was a brilliant communicator of modern psychoanalytic theory and technique, an elegant thinker, a stimulating and supportive teacher, and a man of great wisdom and kindness. His papers on modern psychoanalysis have taught generations of clinicians how to apply Dr. Spotnitz's techniques with narcissistic patients. He welcomed MMI into the community and championed its directors, always encouraging them to step forward with their ideas. A man of capacious mind and heart, he was unique and is completely unforgettable. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to Deborah Margolis, his wife; to his daughter, Helen Michael, and her husband, Mel, and to their family. In Dr. Margolis' honor we are establishing a new scholarship fund to help candidates complete the training program. Donations to the Benjamin Margolis Scholarship Fund may be made in care of MMI, 239 Central Park West, Suite 1AS, New York, NY 10024.
