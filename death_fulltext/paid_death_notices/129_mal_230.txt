        TREUTEL-Edward. The Juilliard School mourns the loss of Edward Treutel, who served the Juilliard trumpet faculty with great distinction for close to 50 years until his retirement in 1995. Many of his students hold prominent positions in orchestras throughout the country today. As a dedicated teacher and musician, he will be missed by his colleagues and students alike.
