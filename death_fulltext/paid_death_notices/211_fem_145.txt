        REKANT -- Linda Esrov 1959-2004. Age 45 and born April 3, 1959, died on August 19, 2004 at home in New York City after a short but courageous battle with cancer. She leaves behind her husband, Bruce Rekant, of Manhattan; a brother, Harvey Esrov of Bethesda, Maryland; and a multitude of family and friends who loved her generous spirit, dynamic personality and infectious sense of humor. She loved Broadway shows, ''All My Children,'' ''The West Wing,'' her health club and little black dresses, but she hated to fly (unless it was First Class). She will always be remembered as devoted to her husband, her family and her numerous friends. She was employed by ESPN for the past 19 years as an executive assistant in Ad Sales, the office of the president, and since 1993 in Communications, where she worked on major projects and with the media, helping to build ESPN's successful brand. One ESPN commentator good-naturedly nicknamed her ''Linda With the Long Hello,'' based upon her penchant for long and cheerful greetings. Mrs. Rekant earned a business degree from Penn State University in 1981. She met her husband, Bruce, an advertising and marketing executive, at an ad agency and they were married in 1989. Services will be held on Sunday, Aug. 22nd at 2:30 P.M. at Riverside Memorial Chapel in Manhattan. Donations may be made in her memory to The V Foundation for Cancer Research, 100 Towerview Court, Cary, N.C. 27513.
