        STRAUS--Roger W. The trustees and staff of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation mourn the passing of a beloved colleague and always stimulating friend who was not only a faithful trustee, from 1973 on, but who embodied the Foundation's history, both as grandnephew of Simon Guggenheim, our founder, and as son of an original trustee. An internationally celebrated publisher of great writers, Roger Straus had an unusually deep understanding of the Foundation's goals in support of gifted artists, scholars, and scientists. We are fortunate indeed to have had the privilege of working with this passionate and cultured man of letters, and to have enjoyed, for many years, his irresistibly engaging intellect and wit. Joseph A. Rice Chairman of the Board of Trustees Edward Hirsch President and Trustee Joel Conarroe President Emeritus and Trustee
