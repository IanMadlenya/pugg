        AVSTREIH-David. We wish to express our profound sadness at the death of our dear friend, David Avstreih. David was an extraordinary man whose life focused not on what he could do for himself, but on what he could do for others. When we met he was our legal advisor, but he and Esther quickly became treasured friends. In addition to being expert in his profession, David was a generous, philosophical, humorous, sensitive and honest man. It is impossible to capture the essence of our David in words, but the best approximation would be ''mensch.'' We are blessed to have known such a man and wish to extend our condolences to our dear friend Esther, their children Alice and Cecil, and Bob, and grandson Dan. We will miss David greatly. Bobbie and Mickey Meshirer
