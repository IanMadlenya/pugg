        LEWIS-Merwin. It is with sorrow that the Directors of Greater New York Mutual Insurance Company record the death of their dear friend and colleague, Merwin Lewis, in his 99th year. The Lewis family has been prominently identified with our Company since its founding 85 years ago. Merwin Lewis joined our Board in 1954. He was a compassionate and caring person deeply involved with the welfare of the Company's employees. A highly respected and experienced attorney, he carried on an active practice until his death. He was a wise and judicious counsellor to our Company and a valuable resource to the Bar of this city and to the community as a whole. We shall miss him. We extend our deepest sympathy to the members of the bereaved family. Alexander E. Rosenthal Chairman of the Board Warren W. Heck, President
