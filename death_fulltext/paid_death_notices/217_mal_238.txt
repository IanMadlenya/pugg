Previously, he worked as a media supervisor at Carat, NY, and a media buyer at DDB/Needham, NY. Tim received a bachelor's degree in economics from Bucknell University, where he also captained the water polo team, receiving All-America, as well as Academic All-America honors in that sport. In 1996, he received the Christy Matthewson Award as Bucknell's outstanding male athlete. Tim was born October 23, 1974, in Santa Monica, CA, and attended the Greenwich, CT, public schools, graduating from Greenwich High School in 1992. He was a four year varsity letterman in swimming and won Connecticut All-State swimming honors in two events. He captained the Greenwich High water polo team and won Eastern Interscholastic and High School All America recognition. As an adult, he became an avid golfer and was a member of the Innis Arden Golf Club in Old Greenwich, CT. Tim is survived by his parents, Jon and Hanneke Nesvig, of Riverside, CT, and two sisters, Mieke and Carrie Nesvig, both of New York City.
