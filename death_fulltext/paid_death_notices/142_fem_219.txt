        BOOKHALTER-Sophie, M.D. We deeply mourn the passing of Dr. Sophie Bookhalter who was an ardent supporter of the American Friends of the Hebrew University through the establishment of the Rasha Ehrman Bookhalter and Sophie Bookhalter, M.D. Endowment Fund which provides scholarships for undergraduate and graduate Israeli students at the Faculty of Medicine; scholarships and stipends for students at the Melton Center for Jewish Education in the Diaspora; and for fellowships in Jewish Studies-at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In recognition, the name of Sophie Bookhalter, M.D. is inscribed at the University's Benefactors Wall on Mount Scopus. Through her efforts the Elsa Nikolic Scholarship Fund for Art History Students was also founded. We extend our sympathies to her family and especially to her niece, Barbara Joyce Bobbin, and cousin, Susan Steinberg Stearns. American Friends of The Hebrew University Keith L. Sachs, President Fred S. Lafer, Chairman of the Board Adam B. Kahan, Executive Vice President
