        GOLDING-Samuel. The Board of Directors, Board of Education, Faculty and Students of The Hebrew Academy of Nassau County (HANC) mourn the loss Monday, July 21, of long time friend, Samuel Golding-Shmuel Ben Yosef. An attorney at law, intellect, philanthropist, honorary member of The HANC Board of Directors, Samuel Golding's energies were directed toward the furtherance of education. His generous support helped bring to fruition the dream of a HANC elementary and nursery school in the West Hempstead community-The Samuel and Elizabeth Bass Golding Elementary School and The Samuel and Elizabeth Bass Golding Early Childhood Center. Samuel Golding's philanthropy was not limited to HANC. Samuel Golding was grandfather to HANC's thousands of graduates. His sage advice and caring will be missed by his HANC family. He is survived by his dear wife, the Honorable Elizabeth Bass Golding. May the memory of Samuel Golding be blessed, and may we merit to carry on his memory through the children of The Hebrew Academy of Nassau County. Rabbi Moshe Gottesman, Dean Rabbi Yessie Lieber, Adminstrator Harvey Liebman, President Isaac Blachor, Chairman, Board of Directors
