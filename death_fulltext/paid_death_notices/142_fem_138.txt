        NOVA-Mercedes. The City University of New York community mourn the tragic death of our colleague, Mercedes Nova. All who knew her in the years she worked in the Central Office Personnel and Budget Offices admired her cheerful spirit, her dedication to her work and her loving care of her two daugthers. She was a graduate of Bronx Community College and Lehman College. She will be sorely missed. We offer sincerest and heartfelt condolences to her family. Christoph M. Kimmich Interim Chancellor
