        BALKE-Eva. March 21, Oslo, Norway. We mourn for an exceptional educator and leader. She had been president of the World Organization for Early Childhood Education. Because of her profound contributions, young children of the world will have a better education and life. She was deeply loved and will be missed internationally. Our thoughts are with her three beloved sons. Gordon Klopf, Rita Cooper Kate Kolchin
