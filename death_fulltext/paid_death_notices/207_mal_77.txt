        LAWRENCE--H. Sherwood, M.D. We deeply mourn the loss of our close friend and colleague of many years, Jerry Lawrence. Jerry and Saul worked together in the Department of Medicine of NYU for almost 60 years. Jerry was a leading researcher, clinician and educator. He served Bellevue patients with great devotion, and educated and trained many generations of students, house staff, and fellows. Many have become leaders in academic medicine. He was a most gentle person. He was a great man and great friend. We extend our condolences to his devoted spouse, Dorothea, his children, and their families. Doris and Saul Farber
