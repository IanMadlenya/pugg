        GERSHEY-Simon C. (Cy), died at home on June 2, 2000. Son of a rabbi, born in Johnstown, PA on May 12, 1902, Cy raised himself up from poverty and abandonment to become a nationally known and respected leader of the jewelry industry. While his career included long and productive tenures with the Benrus, Gruen and Bulova watch companies, his personal and professional associations extended across the U.S. from small stores and small towns to all the major jewelry chains in the largest cities. Cy was widely read and had a strong grasp of history, but he received his informal education through interactions with the broadest range of people. He loved challenges and all aspects of boxing, from training to strategy and execution, and he practiced them literally and figuratively all of his life. His successes may be measured in many ways, but most of all by his many good friends and aquaintances, and never forgetting his origins. To his devoted and loving wife of 60 years, Mimsi, his son, Edward, daughter-in-law, Barbara, grandchildren, Simon and Cristina, and surviving friends, he says, ''Just keep smiling.''
