        VLAMIS--Anne, 91. Died at home after a long illness. Born in Czechoslovakia in 1913 to Joseph and Suzanna Dalechek, she emigrated to the U.S. aboard U.S.S. George Washington via Ellis Island in 1925, reuniting with her father who preceded her to find the family a new home away from the ravages of W.W. I and communism. She grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, finishing high school there and began studying opera before moving to New York City. At the 1939 World's Fair, Anne represented Czechoslovakia as a member of their dance troupe and she was also an active member of the Czechoslovak Society of America for nearly 20 years. In 1940 she married Steve Vlamis at St. Ignatius of Loyola Church, Manhattan, and for over 60 years she was a devoted parishioner of St. Jean Baptiste Church in Manhattan and St. Anne's Shrine. She is survived by her husband, Steve, her two children, Susan and Anthony, and her grandson, Steven Alexander. Family will receive friends Tuesday, 2-4 and 7-9 PM, at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Ave. at 81st St. Mass of Christian Burial Wednesday, 10 AM, at St. Jean Baptiste Church. Interment to follow at Cypress Hills Cemetery.
