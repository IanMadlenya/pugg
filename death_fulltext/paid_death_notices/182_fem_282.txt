        SINGER-Dorothy (Lipkind). Our deepest condolences to our cousins Arthur, Barry and Max on the loss of the beautiful Dottie. The affection we got from her, Mackie and the late Nettie and Sid, is part of our best childhood memories and with us forever. Beverly (Katz) Lowy and Lorraine (Katz) Iatauro
