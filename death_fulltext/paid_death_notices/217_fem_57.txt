        SOMERFIELD--Elsie J., age 88, died peacefully at home on February 3, 2005 with her beloved husband of 68 years, Ralph Murray Somerfield at her side. A native New Yorker, she was a 1937 graduate of Hunter College, later completing her masters degree in Guidance and Counseling at Queens College and doctoral coursework at Fordham University. Her career as a gifted teacher, a compassionate guidance counselor and assistant examiner in charge of counseling and school psychology at the NYC Board of Examiners characterized her commitment to the importance of education and the value of skilled counseling for children in need of help. Her interest in and innate ability to ''hear'' and help others, not only determined her career, but was also a gift she gave to her family and friends. She touched many, many lives. After her retirement she served as a member of the Advisory Council of Queens Children's Psychiatric Center. A mother who deeply loved her children, she worked hard to make sure they had every opportunity to learn the skills they would need to stand on their own two feet in the world, as well as to benefit from life's joys -- music, dance, the beach and country, foreign travel, books, and so much more. She will be profoundly missed by her husband, her daughters Benita Somerfield and Barbara Somerfield-Guffey, her sonin-law John Guffey, her niece Joan Levick, her cousins Roslyn Moskowitz, Bonnie Haber, Sven Mohr, and many others. Memorial donations in her memory may be made to Calvary Hospice, 1740 Eastchester Rd, Bronx, NY 10461.
        SOMERFIELD -- Elsie. Be loved mother, your precious spirit graces us. Your many gifts live within us. Your presence is in our hearts always. Barbara Somerfield John Guffey
