        STONE-Irving. Ohr Torah Stone Colleges and Graduate Programs and especially the Jacob and Jenny Sapirstein High Schools in Ramot, Jerusalem, mourn with profound sorrow the passing of our most benevolent benefactor and truly beloved friend Irving Stone. Irving was a respected patriarch of a magnificent family of four generations and a philanthropist-visionary, totally dedicated to the continuity of our Torah traditions in Clevland, America and Israel. Ohr Torah Stone bears his most honorable name with great pride and will always consider his involvement in our institutions as a sacred trust and responsibility. May his magnificent wife Helen, and the children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the Stone-Weiss families continue his profound legacy and may they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Shlomo Riskin, Chancellor, Ohr Tora Stone Colleges and Graduate Programs Israel
