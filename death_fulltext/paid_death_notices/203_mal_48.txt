        BARON--Herman Theodore (H.T.B.), age 89, born in Yonkers, NY, passed away on November 29, 2003. He lived and worked in Riverdale, NY for most of his adult life. A stellar husband to his late wife, artist Hannelore (nee Alexander) Baron. Always the most generous and loving father to Julie Delyannis and Mark Baron. A cherished grandfather to Tara Ryan and Evan Shenkman. Great-grandfather to Sedona and Elliot Ryan, who he would have so enjoyed knowing. Father-in-law to David Delyannis and Elise Boisante. A devoted son to Henry and Fannie (nee Levine) Baradinsky and, until his death, the last surviving brother to five siblings he loved so much, Murray, Oscar, Harry, Charlie and Celia Schnapper. Loving uncle to Kal Schnapper and to many other nieces and nephews. Herman served proudly in the US Air Corps during WWII and was stationed in Iceland. He was honored with numerous awards for exemplary service. He owned and operated Baron's Book Shop in Riverdale, NY for many years, and then managed the bookstore at Horace Mann Prep and the Union Theological Seminary before retiring in the 1970s. All through his life Herman took real joy in making people laugh. He was a jokester of the most loving sort, and used his natural optimism to uplift the spirits of those around him. He did everything he could for those whose lives touched his, never accepting anything in return. A brilliant man, yet simple things made him happy--classical music, The New York Times, a beautiful day, a hot cup of coffee and a bun. Everyone who knew H.T. Baron--even those who knew him briefly--loved him immensely. He will never be forgotten and will be missed forever.
