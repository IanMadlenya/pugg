        BRUNER-SMITH-C. On June 26, 2001, at the age of 97. The Trinity School community deeply mourns the loss of our inspiring teacher who served the School from 1927 until his death. He will be remembered for his gentle dignity, loving wit, and unique way of making the past come alive. In keeping with Mr. Bruner-Smith's wishes, there will be no funeral service, but there will be a celebration of the life of this fine man at a memorial service to be held on September 30 at Trinity Church. Gifts in Mr. Bruner-Smith's memory may be made to the C. Bruner-Smith Fund for Financial Aid at Trinity School, 139 West 91st Street, NY, NY 10024.
