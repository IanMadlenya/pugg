        KOREMATSU--Fred. The American Civil Liberties Union, its officers, Board of Directors and staff deeply mourn the passing of a courageous fighter for civil liberties. Following Japan's December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, America rounded up in its very own internment camps fellow citizens just because of their Japanese ancestry. Korematsu, born to Japanese immigrants, was a 23-year-old welder in Oakland, CA when military officials ordered all Japanese-Americans on the West Coast into internment camps. Korematsu's family and friends complied and urged him to do so, too. He refused, was arrested, convicted and sent to an internment camp in Utah. The ACLU fought to reverse President Roosevelt's executive order instituting the internment. The ACLU--with the leadership of its West Coast offices--represented Korematsu before the United States Supreme Court, which sided with the government. Scholars now acknowledge this ruling as one of the worst in the court's history. A U.S. District Court in 1983 overturned Korematsu's conviction. ''I thought what the military was doing was unconstitutional,'' Korematsu later said. ''I was really upset because I was branded as an enemy alien when I'm an American.'' Korematsu helped win a national apology and reparations for internment camp survivors and their families in 1988. President Bill Clinton awarded him the nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, ten years later. In 2001, the ACLU bestowed its prestigious Roger N. Baldwin Medal of Liberty award--named for ACLU's founder--on Korematsu, who continued campaigning for civil liberties. He opposed the USA Patriot Act and the U.S. government denial of due process to suspected terror detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The ACLU extends its deepest sympathy to the Korematsu family for the loss of one of America's greatest patriots.
