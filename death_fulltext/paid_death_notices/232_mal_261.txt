        STEIN--Morris. New York University's Psychology Department mourns the loss of Dr. Moe Stein who died May 6 at age 84. Retired as Professor Emeritus in 1991, he was on the NYU faculty since 1960 and had headed the Doctoral Program in Social Psychology. Well known for his work on personality and the nature and encouragement of creativity, he authored over ten books and accrued many honors. He was born in the Bronx, educated at De Witt Clinton High School, CCNY, and Harvard, and taught at Wheaton College and Chicago University before returning to New York City. We extend our condolences to his family and former students.
