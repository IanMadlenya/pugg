        SEMMEL -- Herbert. The board and staff of New York Lawyers for the Public Interest mourn the passing of our beloved colleague, Herb Semmel. Under his leadership as litigation director, NYLPI brought numerous landmark civil rights lawsuits. His wisdom, wit, integrity, compassion, and skill as a mentor made him an extraordinary role model. Herb's myriad contributions were recognized last year with the Felix A. Fishman Award for Public Service. We shall miss him profoundly. NYLPI
