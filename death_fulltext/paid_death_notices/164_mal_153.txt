        MONTGOMERY-Robert H. Jr. The Vassar College Board of Trustees honors the life of its esteemed trustee Robert H. Montgomery, Jr. He served Vassar with indefatigable energy for the past decade, bringing keen intelligence, balance of thought, and irrestible humor to our work. We will remember him most vividly for the extraordinary warmth of his manner, and for the true engagement he brought to conversations with students, faculty and administrators, and with his fellow trustees. We shall all miss his excellent company. Everyone at Vassar extends condolences to his wife, Henriette deSieyes, Vassar Class of 1945; his son, Samuel; his daughter, Margaret; and his grandchildren. Frances D. Fergusson, President Richard E. Van Demark, Chair Board of Trustees
