        WALLACH-John. We are deeply saddened by the loss of our friend, John Wallach. He was a great, inspiring leader of our common mission-to advance the cause of a just peace. Through his commitment and courage, he brought to public attention the importance of peace on children's lives. Our deepest sympathy to Janet, Michael, and David.
