        WITTKE-Paul. G. Schirmer, Inc. mourns the death of our friend and colleague on February 6. Associated with our firm for nearly half a century, he was the devoted editor of composers Samuel Barber, Leonard Bernstein, Gian Carlo Menotti, Leon Kirchner, John Corigliano, John Adams, and many others, as well as the guiding spirit behind the journal ''The Musical Quarterly''. His astute observations on all the arts, and his intellect, wit, advice, compassion, elegance, commitment, integrity, and modesty will be sorely missed by his many colleagues in our field. Our heartfelt condolences to his beloved wife, Margaret, her brothers, and their families.
