        QUINN--David C., on May 25, 2004, in North Salem, NY. A trial lawyer, actor, rare book collector and aviator, he flew in World War II and the Vietnam War. Flying air-sea rescue in 1945, he made the first landing to pick up a downed pilot off the coast of Japan--a feat recorded in the book, ''High Honor.'' He is survived by his wife, columnist Jane Bryant Quinn, and five children, David P., Christopher, Justin, Martha Quinn Tarlow, stepson, Matthew Ostrowski, and seven grandchildren. He was much loved. A memorial service will be held at a later date.
