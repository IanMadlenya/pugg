        SALOMON-Sophie. Age 88. Beloved wife of the late Mardoqueo I. Salomon. She is survived by her loving children Ruth and Edward King, and Hilel and Iole Salomon. She was the adored ''Nana'' of her grandchildren Judith King, Debbie and Jon Green, Diane and Gideon King, Jonny King and Jacqueline Sailer, Alexander and Anick Salomon, Rebekah and Thierry LeMagny, and Joshua Salomon and great-grandchildren Zachary, Aliza and Emma.
