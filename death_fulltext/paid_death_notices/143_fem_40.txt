        SERKIN-Irene. The Musicians, Trustees, Staff and Family of the Marlboro Music School and Festival mourn the loss of one of the most important founding members of our community, and extend our sincere sympathy to her family. Since our founding in 1951, Irene Serkin played a major role in helping to shape the direction and special family atmosphere of Marlboro. She was an extraordinary friend and support to young musicians both personally and professionally, and we were all inspired by her total devotion to Marlboro's musical and humanistic goals. We will miss her very much. Stephen Stamas, Chairman Anthony Checchia and Frank Salomon, Administrators Marlboro Music School and Festival
