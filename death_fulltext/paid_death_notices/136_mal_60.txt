        LIPPMANN-Heinz, M.D. The Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University mourns the passing of our Distinguished University Professor Emeritus, a beloved physician and scientist, and inspirational teacher of rehabilitation medicine, who so generously shared his vast knowledge and skill during a five-decade affiliation with our medical school. An accomplished pianist, his dexterous fingers worked magically in creating music as well as in offering a healing touch. His kind, gentle manner, his wisdom and keen humor, and his compassion for patients and students will remain hallmarks of his legacy at Einstein. We offer our deepest sympathy to his wife, Alisa; his children, Coco Ruth, Robert, and Lawrence; and the entire Lippmann family. Dominick P. Purpura, M.D., Dean Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University
