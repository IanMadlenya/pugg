        O'NEILL-John. The members, officers and staff of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union mourn the loss of John O'Neill, retired RWDSU Vice President and RWDSU Local 3 President. His selfless devotion to the cause of working people made a difference in the lives of generations of workers at Bloomingdale's and the rest of the department store industry. He fought for the right of every worker to be treated with dignity, justice and respect. Our deepest sympathy goes to his daughter Barbara and to all the members of Local 3 whose lives he touched.
