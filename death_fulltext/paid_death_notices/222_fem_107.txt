        DOWD -- Margaret Agnes. The staff of The New York Times was deeply saddened by the death of Peggy Dowd, the beloved mother of our colleague Maureen Dowd, on Sunday, July 17. Mrs. Dowd, who was 97, was born when Teddy Roosevelt was still building the Panama Canal and lived to see her children, grandchildren, and greatgrandchildren enjoy the marvels of the digital age. Her long and rich life was filled with the love of her family and her many friends and admirers, including generations of Times employees. Her boundless good humor, compassion and strength were inspiring to all those whose lives she touched. Faithful readers of the Times Op-Ed page knew her as the wise, wry and immensely humane observer on the profundities and oddities of life who appeared from time to time in Maureen Dowd's column. Margaret Agnes Dowd was the wife of the late Michael J. Dowd and mother of Michael J., Martin M., Margaret A., Kevin B. and Maureen B Dowd. She was grandmother of Dana, Jennifer, Michael, Tara, Brendan, Patrick and Brian; and great-grandmother of Anthony, Anna and Kasey. A Memorial Mass will be held at the Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament Church, Washington, D.C., at Western Avenue & Qesada Street, on Wednesday, July 27, at 11 A.M. Interment will be private. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to the Multiple Sclerosis Society, National Chapter, 2021 K Street, NW, suite 715, Washington, DC 20006-1035.
