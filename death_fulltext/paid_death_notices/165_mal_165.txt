        MARINO-Gaspare. Son of Domenico and Caterina. Prominent restauranteur and amateur opera singer in the New York City scene since the early 1950's. Well respected in the community and leader of his extensive family, died October 11 in his retirement retreat in Bagheria, Sicily, just outside the city of Palermo. He leaves behind his faithful wife Rosa, his daughter Cathy Marino Speciale and son, Dominick Marino, four loving grandchildren, Maurizio, Valentina, Michael and Laura and his sister Frances Marino Saladino and brother Matteo Marino. His wit, courage and generosity will be greatly missed.
