        KATZ-Neale D. We mourn the loss of our friend and colleague, Neale D. Katz. Neale served faithfully as Israel Representative & Director General of the United Israel Appeal from September 1984-1996. Operation Moses, the initial movement of Ethiopian Jews to Israel, was successful, in part, due to Neale's lead role. Neale was tenacious in his pursuit of justice for those he served. His UIA responsibilities, on behalf of the American Jewish Federation system, included a close monitoring of and working with the Jewish Agency for Israel. He championed programs of Immigration and Absorption of new immigrants to Israel, Public housing (AMIGOUR), neighborhood redevelopment (Project Renewal) and the Israel Education Fund. Neale made Aliyah with his wife, Sandy, and their four children in August 1972, leaving a successful law practice in Chicago, Illinois. He served as an active member, officer and awardee of the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago Young People's Division, as well as the National United Jewish Appeal Young Leadership Cabinet. He was indefatigable in his travels to explain the work of the Jewish Agency for Israel. He was an Associate Member of its Executive. He also served as the Treasurer of the World Conference of Jewish Communal Service. Neale will be missed by his many friends and colleagues. He was a member of the ''best and the brightest''. Neale is survived by his wife, Sandy, his children, Richie & Vicki Katz, Amy Katz, David and Karijna Katz, and Nancy & Allan Myburgh and two grandchildren, Billy & Iris. Burial in Jerusalem, December 5, 2000. Condolences may be sent to: Katz Family Shai Agnon 16, Apt 5, Jerusalem, Israel. Baruch Dayan Emet United Jewish Communities and United Israel Appeal Charles R.
