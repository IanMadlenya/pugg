        KAUFMANN -- Peter, 86, Founder of P. Kaufmann, Inc. The employees of P. Kaufmann, Inc., mourn the passing of our founder, chairman, and friend, Mr. Peter Kaufmann, on January 20, 2004. He will be deeply missed. Mr. Kaufmann's leadership, dignity, caring, and compassion were both inspirational and remarkable. He was a man who believed in being successful but he did not believe that success should be achieved at any cost. Mr. Kaufmann came to this country after World War II and founded the company in 1957. Initially the company distributed man-made fibers but eventually entered the decorative fabric business as a distributor of printed linens. Over the years, the company expanded through growth and acquisition and today is one of the leading converters in the industry, employing over 400 people. Amongst Mr. Kaufmann's legacies is the respect and generosity with which he treated his employees and the foresight he had in preparing a younger generation of leaders to take over the management of the company at a time that Mr. Kaufmann was still vibrant and capable of running the company he founded. A memorial service will be held on Friday, January 23 at 2:30 PM. at the Stephen Wise Free Synagogue, 30 W. 68th Street in NYC. For anyone wishing to make a contribution in memory of Mr. Kaufmann, he was involved with both Citymeals-On-Wheels (355 Lexington Avenue) and City Harvest (575 8th Avenue).
