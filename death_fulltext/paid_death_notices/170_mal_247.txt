        ROSENTHAL-Alexander E. The Directors, Officers, and Staff of GNY Insurance Companies mourn the loss of their esteemed Chairman and dear friend. Alex Rosenthal joined the company in 1934 as a lawyer, and rose rapidly in the company to become its Chairman of the Board and CEO. He was a skillful leader who served our companies with distinction for over 66 years, and was singularly responsible for our great success. He was a compassionate and caring person deeply involved with the welfare of our employees. We shall miss his judicious counsel in our midst. He leaves a void that shall deeply affect us all. We extend our deepest sympathy to his dear wife Beatrice and his sons Richard and James. Warren W. Heck, President
