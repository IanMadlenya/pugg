        EISDORFER -- Simon. On March 16, 2005, of Cedarhurst, NY. Devoted husband of Beatrice (Feld), beloved father of Barbara Waitman and James Eisdorfer and his wife Rae, loving brother of Al Eisdorfer, adoring grandfather of Jennifer, Adam, the late Joshua, and Jonathan Waitman and his wife Rebecca, and Aliza, Jesse and his wife Jamie, and Talia Eisdorfer, and cherished great grandfather of Lyla and Joshua. Simon was born on the lower east side and graduated from Stuyvesant High School and CCNY. A World War II army veteran, Simon later joined the N.Y.P.D., in which he served for 38 years. He rose through the ranks to become a three-star Chief. He was the N.Y.P.D.'s first Chief of Organized Crime Control and retired as Chief of Personnel. In 1976, Simon was the first recipient of the N.Y.P.D Shomrim Society's Asser Levy Award to the person who best exemplifies the strong commitment of Jews to police service. He was a mentor and role model to many. As Director of the Special Operations Division of the N.Y.P.D., Simon developed a new technique for negotiations in hostage situations and successfully obtained the safe release of hostages held in a sporting goods store in 1973. He later testified before Congress regarding his innovative approach to hostage negotiations, a method which is still in use today. In addition to his professional career, Simon was actively involved with Jewish causes. He was a founder of the Chabad Center of the Five Towns, a Grand Marshall of the Israeli Day Parade, and a volunteer with the Israeli Defense Force. He lived by the motto ''Do justly. Love mercy. And walk humbly with thy G-d.'' Contributions in his memory may be made to Chabad Center of the Five Towns.
