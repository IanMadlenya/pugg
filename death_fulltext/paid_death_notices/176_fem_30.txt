        WIENER-Gloria, died August 25th, 2001 after a valiant battle with cancer. She was predeceased by Don, her husband of 48 years, in November 2000. Gloria had a long, successful executive career in marketing and communications with Paine Webber and Merrill Lynch where she impressed her staff, peers and senior management with her ability to create relevant, quality materials to support the overall goals of the company. She retired from Merrill Lynch in 1987 as Vice President of Advertising and Sales Promotion. Gloria and Don divided their retirement years between Manhattan and their country home in Andes, NY in the Western Catskills. They also traveled extensively both nationally and internationally. Gloria was a lover of art, music and literature; she was an accomplished writer and classical and folk guitarist. Gloria was an avid birder and lover of nature; she catalogued the flora & fauna of her country home and wrote frequent articles for ''Hunting House News'', a publication of the Andes Society. Gloria loved crosscountry skiing with her husband and friends. She was a talented chef and a great hostess. Gloria is survived by her loving sisters, Ella May Ablahat & Louise Del Savio, and her loving brother, Gordon Cason; by five nieces and nephews and an extended family of longtime, loving friends-all of whom will miss Gloria's warmth, intelligence and good humor. There will be no service. Contributions in Gloria's memory may be made to the Beaverkill Valley Fire Department, HCR 1, Lew Beach, NY 12758, or to the Audubon Society of New York State, 46 Rarick Road, Selkirk, New York 12158
