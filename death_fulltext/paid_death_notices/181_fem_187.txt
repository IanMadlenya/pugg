        BANG-JENSEN-Helen Jean Nolan, 87. On January 21, 2002. She was the widow of Povl BangJensen, a Danish diplomat and UN official. Active in the Chappaqua community, Mrs. Bang-Jensen served as a local newspaper correspondent and founding member of the New Castle Historical Society. A Port Jervis native, she graduated from Elmira College, Phi Beta Kappa, in 1936. In Washington, DC, prior to WWII, she was employed by the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies and was elected president of the International Student House, a de facto center for students and young professionals supporting the allies. She received a commendation from the King of Denmark for her work during WWII. She was an editor of The InterAmerican, a political affairs journal. In 1991 the President of Hungary honored Mrs. Bang-Jensen for her husband's efforts to protect Hungarians testifying before the UN about the 1956 Revolution, which lead to his firing from the UN and death in 1959. In 1989, Hungary erected a memorial to her husband next to the gravesites of Imre Nagy and other leaders of the Revolution and, in 1999, a bust of her husband was added to the busts of three early Foreign Ministers in the lobby of the Foreign Ministry. She is survived by her children: Karen Zumwalt, of Chappaqua; Per of Warrenton, VA; Lise of Albany; Lars of Burlington, VT; and Nina of Chevy Chase, MD; and five grandchildren. A memorial service will be held at 11 AM, March 23, at Union Church, Pocantico Hills, where Mrs. Bang-Jensen worked for Historic Hudson Valley until 1999 as a guide for the Chagall and Matisse stained glass windows.
