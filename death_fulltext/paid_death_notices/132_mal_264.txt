        KASSL-Robert A. We note with profound sorrow the death of Robert A. Kassl, President of Karey-Kassl Corporation. Devoted husband of Joan-Marie. Loving father of Robert N. and Marliese. Cherished grandfather of Andrew, Adam, Katherine, Thomas, and Bradley. He was deeply admired and respected by all whose lives he touched. A loving, compassionate, fair-minded human being who will be sorely missed by his family, relatives and many friends. Our loss is Heaven's gain.
