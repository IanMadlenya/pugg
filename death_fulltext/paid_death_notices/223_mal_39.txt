        RACANELLI--Nicholas. The Meltzer family deeply regrets the passing of a dear friend. Our heartfelt sympathies are extended to his wife Corinne, sons Nicholas E., David, Damian, Matthew and the rest of his family. He was a wonderful and loving husband, father and grandfather. A man of great distinction and integrity who left his mark and who was always sensitive to the needs of others.
