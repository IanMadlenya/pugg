        KALAJIAN-Roxy. At certain times, life has a way of confounding the wise among us in yielding a startling alchemy among warring elements in our nature. Such a thing happened some 30 years ago while anguished, despairing Moms and Dads dropped off their young at our doorstop at Daytop Village. Their failure as parents was engraved on their faces. It was for them the end of the road that is, until a lone figure began to stand tall against the tide of selfsympathy, with her own failedparenting scars clearly visible and with a passion for gentle confrontation, she led generations of parents to the hard-ground of vital, responsible parenting. And Daytop overnight became ''A Family Repair Station'' with Roxy both teacher-extraordinaire and role model. Tennyson phrased it aptly in his mourning over Maud: ''There has fallen a splendid tear from the passion-flower at the gate!'' Her memory is deeply cherished; her footprints a lasting guide. May she revel in God's love! May her beloved Berge and the Family feel the strength of our prayers. (Msgr.) William B. O'Brien President Daytop Village, Inc.
