        KAPLAN-Benjamin B. Passed unexpectedly Friday, May 24, 2002, one day and one month short of his 100th birthday. We cannot describe how much this extraordinary man will be missed by his many dear relatives and loving friends. He is survived by his devoted wife, Eleanor; beloved children, Jordan and Hilary; caring daughter-in-law, Dori; adoring grandchildren, Dovid, Rachel, Yosef, Yaakov, Naomi, Malkie, Estie, and Rikki. Bridging a generation gap among his admiring nieces and nephews, he was a learned and innovative man who generously shared his lifelong pursuit of knowledge. May his expectation for eternal sleep be fully realized. A donation to a charity of your choice in his name would be gratefully appreciated.
