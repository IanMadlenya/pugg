        HALL--Evelyn A.J. (Mrs. Melville W. Hall). The Society of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center mourns the passing of our Advisory Council member and longtime volunteer in The Society's Fresh Flower Program. A generous supporter of the Center's many innovative programs, Evie also brought joy to the Center's youngest patients by establishing the Big Apple Circus Clown Care Unit (tm) at MSKCC. We offer our sincerest condolences to her family. Mrs. Arie L. Kopelman, President The Society of MSKCC
