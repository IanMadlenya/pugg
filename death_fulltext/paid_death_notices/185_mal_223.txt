        MIHALY-Dr. Eugene. The President, Chancellor, Boards of Governors and Overseers, faculty, administration and students of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion record with profound sorrow the death of Dr. Eugene Mihaly, Deutsch Professor Emeritus of Jewish Jurisprudence and Social Justice, Professor Emeritus of Rabbinic Literature and Homiletics, former Executive Dean and Vice President for Academic Affairs and Cincinnati faculty member for over four decades. Dr. Mihaly touched the souls of generations of students with his passion for text, his erudition and creativity. His book, ''A Song to Creation'', inspired his students not only to understand text but to find their own voices as they study the complexities of Torah. His keen insight and leadership was instrumental in the academic growth nd vitality of HUC-JIR. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his beloved wife, Cecile, sons Eugene and Marc and family whose loss we share. May they find comfort together with all those who mourn for Zion and Jerusalem. Rabbi David Ellenson, Pres. Rabbi Alfred Gottschalk, Chancellor Emeritus Burton Lehman, Chair, Board of Governors
