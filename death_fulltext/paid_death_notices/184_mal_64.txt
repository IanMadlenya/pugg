        JOSEPH-Robert L. Writer and producer, age 79. A totally cerebral, extraordinary mensch with an inquiring mind, never satisifed with the ''pat'' answer. An intellectual surgeon who drew much more out of people than they felt they had. Always a playwright and author searching for a different dimension. A catalyst who brought people together and brought people to him. From that special generation of theater people -the wonderful greats -a world of theater which is no longer with us, and of which he was a part. A man who never censored what he had to say. A man who left pople feeling loved and worthy. Died Monday, April 29, the result of head injuries sustained in a fall at his home in East Chatham, NY, April 27. A memorial will be held in NYC at 333 East 56th St, 12 noon, Friday, May 10.
