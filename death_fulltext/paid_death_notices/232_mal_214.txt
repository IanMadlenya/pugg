        MERRIFIELD--Bruce. The Rockefeller University community mourns with deep sadness the loss of our beloved colleague and friend, Bruce Merrifield, a biochemist whose research greatly advanced the understanding of the relationship between the chemical structures of proteins and their physical and biological properties. A Nobel laureate, Dr. Merrifield served the university with distinction for nearly 60 years. World-renowned for his development of a rapid, automated procedure for synthesizing peptides, Dr. Merrifield has been credited with making possible the systematic exploration of the structural basis of the activity of enzymes, hormones and antibodies. He trained generations of peptide chemists and his impact on the field is immeasurable. Dr. Merrifield was passionate about research and he was active at the lab bench into his 80's. He was truly one of the seminal figures in biological chemistry of the 20th century. He will be profoundly missed. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife Libby Merrifield, a beloved member of our community who worked in his lab for 23 years, his children, and grandchildren.
