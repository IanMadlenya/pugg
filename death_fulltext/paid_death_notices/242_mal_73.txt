        ALPERT--Warren. It is with genuine sadness that the Dean, faculty, and staff of Harvard Medical School acknowledge the passing of Warren Alpert, a generous benefactor and enthusiastic supporter of the Medical School. His philanthropy is exemplified by his endowment of both the Warren Alpert Research Building and the annual Warren Alpert Foundation Prize, which recognizes the world's leading medical researchers for their breakthroughs. As a founding donor of the New Pathway curriculum at the Medical School, he will also be long remembered for his dedication to medical education. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his family.
