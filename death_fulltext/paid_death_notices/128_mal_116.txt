        SOLTI-Georg. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of our esteemed colleague Georg Solti. One of music's giants, Sir Georg was to conduct the MET Orchestra this Spring, and we profoundly regret that this renewal of his relationship with our company will not come to pass. But, we remember with deep gratitude, his incalculable contributions to music through his numerous associations with the world's great orchestras and opera companies, most notably the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the Royal Opera at Covent Garden. And, his immense discography will provide a vibrant legacy for future generations. We shall miss him greatly, and extend our deepest sympathy to his family. Joseph Volpe, General Manager James Levine, Artistic Director
