        GEBINER-Benjamin. We mourn the loss of a learned and compassionate friend whose sense of social justice extended to people everywhere. He championed worker's rights, and, as a believer in Isrel, he supported labor Israel's message. He demonstrated a strong love for his family, to whom we extend our condolences, and for the Jewish people, his extended family. National Committee for Labor Israel/Israel Histadrut Campaign Jay Mazur, President Jerry Goodman, Executive Dir.
