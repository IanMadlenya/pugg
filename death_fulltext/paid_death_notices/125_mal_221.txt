        EVANS-Glen, on June 17, 1997. The American Society of Journalists and Authors (ASJA) mourns the passing of our past president (1987-88), the distinguished author of many books and hundreds of magazine articles. As editor of ASJA's 1983 book, ''The Complete Guide to Writing Nonfiction,'' Glen helped inspire and instruct thousands of freelance writers. His contribution to the Society were many and varied, and we will miss him greatly. Our deepest sympathy goes to his wife, Marge, and daughter, Lisa. In accord with his wishes, donations may be sent to the ASJA Charitable Trust-Miller Fund (the fund for writers in financial need), 1501 Broadway, #
