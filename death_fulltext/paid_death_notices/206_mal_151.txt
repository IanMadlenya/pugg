        NATHANIEL--George S. Born 86 years ago today in Baghdad, Iraq, died on January 4, 2004 of complications following a broken hip. His family moved during his adolescence to Tehran, Iran where he eventually attended the American University. Sponsored by his American professor, George left all he knew and loved in the old world, to meet the future in the USA, which he believed then and for the rest of his life to be the land of freedom and opportunity. He accom plished much for those he cherished most in his life: his family. He married Dr. Semha Sheena, also of Baghdad, and they raised three children. One of the original handful of Iraqi Jews to settle in the US, he was the keeper of the continuity of the family, both here and abroad. He helped bring his mother, six siblings, seven in-laws and 15 nieces and nephews to the US and Canada. He loved education and was unflaggingly interested in the welfare of all members of his family until his death. His wife, one daughter, two sons, seven grandchildren and an eighth on the way survive him.
