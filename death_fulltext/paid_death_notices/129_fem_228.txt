        FILLMAN-Susan. We extend our deepest sympathy to the family of Susan Fillman, our friend and longtime Board member. Her ideas and action were always inspiring. Her dedication to the community, especially to its youngest members, gave us focus. Although she is gone, her spirit will live on, encouraging us to follow her example. We shall miss her deeply.
