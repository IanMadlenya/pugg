She was a senior associate at the Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison law firm and a graduate of Bryn Mawr College, Columbia Graduate School of Business and Vanderbilt Law School, where she was an editor of the Vanderbilt Law Review. She is survived by her parents, Nora R. and Gabriel B. Schwartz, her brother, William J., her sister, Margaret A. (Felsenthal), and her cherished nephews and nieces.
