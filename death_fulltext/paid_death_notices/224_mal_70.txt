        SCHER--Benjamin. The employees of Scher Fabrics, Inc. mourn the loss of our cofounder, our beloved Mr. Ben, at the age of 104. Ben was the father of our Vice President, Richard Scher, and brother of his lifelong business partner, the late Robert Scher. A gentle, sweet soul, Ben devoted himself to the growth and development of Scher Fabrics from its earliest days until he reached his 90's. His concern for his employees was legendary. We mourn his loss and extend our condolences to his family at this time.
