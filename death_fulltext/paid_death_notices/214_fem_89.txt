        DIAMOND--Toni M. With deep sorrow we mourn the loss of a champion in MDA's fight against neuromuscular diseases. Our valiant Toni lost her battle with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis at age 46 on November 11. She was the inspiration and drive behind MDA's Wings Over Wall Street, which annually raises millions of dollars for MDA ALS research efforts. Our hearts go out to Warren Schiffer, Toni's husband and love of her life. To Warren we vow to continue our intense efforts to defeat ALS.
