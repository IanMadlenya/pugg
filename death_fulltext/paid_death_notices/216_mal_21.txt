        PERLOW -- Irving. The HAFTR community is deeply saddened by the passing of our beloved founding principal, devoted teacher and mentor. He was an unwavering advocate for our children. His passion and commitment since the establishment of the Hillel School, will never be forgotten. He is survived by family living in Israel. May they be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. The former Hillel School and the Hebrew Academy of the Five Towns and Rockaway.
