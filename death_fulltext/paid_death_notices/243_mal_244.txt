        HOLLIS--Zachary. August 22, 1990-April 19, 2007. It is with deepest sorrow that the Board of Directors, Staff and Members of the Tourette Syndrome Association (TSA) mourn the passing of Zachary Hollis, who died tragically and suddenly in an automobile accident in Albuquerque, NM. A kind, cheerful and gentle young man, in his all too brief 16 years, undeniably he touched the lives of everyone who knew him with his positive outlook, exceptional warmth, contagious smile and quick wit. His indomitable spirit and irrepressible sense of humor will be missed by family, friends and all who knew him. He had a passion for research and geology and loved school. He was very active in Boy Scouts and was close to making Eagle Scout, a rank he is being awarded posthumously. Zak also collected old Volkswagen models, enjoyed playing tennis and swimming, and was an avid animal lover, faithfully nurturing his dozens of pets. He wanted to become a neurologist and study the brain. Diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome at the age of eight, he always sought opportunities to raise awareness about this neurological disorder. Zak volunteered his time to the TSA selflessly. He served as an editor of the TSA Children's Newsletter and each year, eagerly looked forward to traveling to Washington D.C. to meet personally with his elected officials to educate them and put a real face on what it meant to have Tourette Syndrome. Zak will be receiving the TSA National Youth Recognition Award posthumously, and the award will be renamed The Zak Hollis National Youth Recognition Award in his honor. Our deepest sympathies and prayers go to his parents, Sandra and Michael, and his siblings, Joshua, Christopher, Jennifer and Rosanna. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made to the Tourette Syndrome Association, Inc., 42-40 Bell Boulevard, Bayside, NY 11361. He will be missed dearly and always remembered with a smile by the many, many people whose lives he touched.
