        WINOKUR-Bruce R. July 29, 2002. We note with sadness the passing of our esteemed friend and colleague, for whom choral music and computers were abiding joys, and the practice of law was a challenge at which he excelled. Bruce will be sorely missed. All of us at Jackson & Nash, LLP offer our condolences to Bruce's family and his friends. We join Bruce's family in asking those who would care to contribute in his memory to consider the Rottenberg Chorale, where Bruce was an enthusiastic member of the bass section for many years. Call 212501-3362 for Chorale details.
