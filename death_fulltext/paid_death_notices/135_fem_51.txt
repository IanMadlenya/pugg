        NANCE-Arlene. We are saddened by the death of our esteemed colleague and friend.

She was widely acknowledged as the leading townhouse expert for the Village and the downtown market & was a significant figure for so many years in our industry. We are grateful to have been associated with her and send our deepest sympathy to her husband Harry and her daughter Erika. Howard P. Milstein Chairman Joan Ambrose Nan MarElia Douglas Elliman
