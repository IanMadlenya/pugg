        HOWARD-Edith M. M.D.. On February 9, 2000. Beloved sister of Dellora and the late Raymond and Fernando. Loving aunt of Eric, John, Armando and Abenaa. Devoted sister-in-law of Olive, Jane and Joyce. Mourned by many friends, who will miss her wit, her brilliance, her artistic talent and her loving generosity. Rest in peace, dearest Edith.
