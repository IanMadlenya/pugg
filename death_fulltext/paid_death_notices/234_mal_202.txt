        TRIAS--Peter J. Poet, painter, designer, architect and real estate developer, died suddenly on Friday night, Bastille Day, of an apparent heart attack. He was 57 and lived in Venice, California and Sag Harbor, New York. Peter was born November 14, 1948 in Detroit, Michigan, the first of the five children of George and Alexandra Trias. The family soon moved to Levittown on Long Island and, in 1959, to Merrick. Peter graduated from Merrick High in 1966, received a BA from Hobart College and a MFA in poetry from the Iowa Writers Workshop. In 1976 he published a collection of poems, That House in Venice. Peter taught poetry in North Carolina, worked in advertising in New York and finally settled in Los Angeles where he began buying and selling old houses. He became a successful realtor in Venice Beach and a popular figure in the neighborhood. He was a shrewd businessman, yet generous to the point of indulgence with his many tenants, carrying some of them for months until they could manage to pay the rent--sometimes even if they couldn't pay. He is survived by his companion of fourteen years, Ed Rothfarb, and, also, by his mother and father, his sisters, Georgia and Margaret, his brothers Gary and Theodore, and five nieces and nephews. Peter lived modestly and gave freely of his time, money, humor, affection and his hard-earned wisdom. He was a unique, beloved and irreplaceable friend to all who knew him. A closed-casket viewing will be held Monday from 2-5 and 7-9 at N.F. Walker Funeral Home at 2039 Merrick Avenue in Merrick. Interment will be Tuesday at 11:30 at the Oakland Cemetery, Jermain Street, Sag Harbor, NY.
