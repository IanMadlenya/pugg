        SANDORF--Florence. We are devastated at the loss of our ''Auntie Florence'' who brightened our lives with her warmth, beauty, laughter and guidance. We extend our love and sympathy to our dear friends Irving, Julie, Michael, Sarah, Lisa, Caralynn and Aidan. The memory of her remarkable spirit will be in our hearts forever.
