        WHITE-John S. New York City Opera mourns the passing of one of its most esteemed and cherished company members, John White. Born in Vienna, he joined the company in 1946 as its first language coach and went on to serve the City Opera as a stage director, administrator and, from 1970 until his retirement in 1980, managing director. He continued to serve as a consultant until his death. With general director Julius Rudel, he established the City Opera as a true operatic repertory company that continued to grow in stature over the years. Many of the young American singers who joined the company during his tenure went on to establish major careers throughout the world. For 55 years, the City Opera has benefited from his knowledge and his wise counsel. He leaves an indelible mark on our company, as well as in our lives, and we will miss him greatly.
