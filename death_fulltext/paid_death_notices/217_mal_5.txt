        HEISSENBUTTEL -- Robert H., M.D. The Department of Medicine of Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons mourn the loss of Robert H. Heissenbuttel, M.D. He spent the entirety of his medical career at Columbia, receiving his M.D. in 1963 and continuing his training in medicine and cardiology here before joining the Division of Cardiology in 1969. He epitomized superb clinical care, and was able to convey his approach, informed by both intellect and compassion, to the many students and residents who trained with him. Donations may be sent to the Ernest and Jean Heissenbuttel Scholarship in Literature, Thiel College, 75 College Avenue, Greenville, PA 16125. We send our deepest condolences to his family. David A.

        HEISSENBUTTEL--Robert H., M.D. The Division of Cardiology mourns the loss of its esteemed colleague and dear friend, Dr. Robert H. Heissenbuttel. A graduate of Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons, he trained in internal medicine and cardiology at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. For 35 years, Dr. Heissenbuttel was an outstanding clinical cardiologist who served as a role model for a generation of medical students, medical house staff and cardiology fellows. As a Clinical Professor of Medicine at Columbia, he made numerous contributions to enhancing patient care, teaching and clinical research related to the pharmacology of antiarrythmic drugs. His kind and gentle demeanor will be sorely missed. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Sharon and his children, Beth Eifert and Bill Heissenbuttel.
