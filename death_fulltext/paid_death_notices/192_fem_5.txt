        ANCOWITZ - GERASIMOVA Irina, M.D., Ph.D. passed away in Pamplona, Spain at the Clinic Universateria, after a long illness. She was born in St. Petersburg, Russia and obtained her medical degree at The First Medical School where she later became an Assistant Professor, lecturing on biology. At the same time, she was able to study, and obtain her Ph.D. in Human Genetics in 1978-one of the few in Russia to have such a degree at the time. She emigrated to the U.S. in 1979 and was able to be enrolled at the Psychiatric Institute at ColumbiaPresbyterian where she completed her four years of residency. She later qualified for, and received, her Board Certification in Psychiatry. Although she was a modest person who rarely spoke of her accomplisments, she greatly affected the lives of many people - relatives, friends and patients, to the point where her advice and counsel and healing techniques will remain with them for the rest of their lives. Irina was blessed to have a loving daughter Svetlana, who gave Irina a grandson, Enrique Jose, who was the joy of Irina's life in her last months. Thank you Irina for all you did for the people who were fortunate to have come under your wings.
