        HOSIOSKY--Ellen N., D.M.D. Died on April 18, 2007 at home after a brief battle with cancer at the age of ninety six. She was the loving and devoted wife to Issai Hosiosky who died in 1998. Ellen was truly a pioneer for women educationally and professionally. She graduated from Columbia Dental School with honors and became the first woman on their teaching staff. Ellen had a true passion for learning and that passion did not stop with dentistry. She studied all forms of medicine and incorporated that knowledge into her dental practice. Her love for learning is only surpassed by her willingness to pass that knowledge on to others. Dr. Ellen Hosiosky was truly a charitable person, not only with her money, but more importantly with her time to help others. She will be missed.
