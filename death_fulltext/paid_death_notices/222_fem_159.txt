        LUBIN--Carol R. With deep sorrow, we bid farewell to our incredible neighbor. For the past 20 years, we were privileged to have her as a role model and inspiration. With her work at the UN and her many other interests she continued in her mid 90's to be a contributing member of society for the world at large. She will be greatly missed. We share her loss with her entire family. Gloria and Richard Kobrin
