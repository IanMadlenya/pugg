        BARASH-Ernest, MD. The Jewish Home and Hospital medical department and entire staff mourn the loss of Ernest Barash, MD, Chief of Orthopedics for more than 30 years. ''Ernie'' was a friend to many, an outstanding surgeon and clinician, a favorite teacher of the more than 2,000 students and fellowship physicians in training at Jewish Home and a person who shared his positiveness with all.
