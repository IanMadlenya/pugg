        CUTHBERT--William Rodger, son of Helen Rodger and Lawrence F. Cuthbert, born April 21, 1919 in Ogdensburg, NY, died in his home in Naples, FL at 12:40 AM, December 20, 2004. Bill attended Deerfield Academy ('38) & Kenyon College ('42). Among his best memories were ''busting the polo ponies'', and classical music in the hanger while learning the mechanics of aircraft & flying. President of the National Intercollegiate Flying Club, his first job was with the Aeronca Aircraft Company. He married Janet Lamberton, affectionately known as ''Lamb'', on December 20, 1941. Enlisting in the U.S. Army Air Corps, Bill flew with the 30th Fighter Squadron in Panama: he called his P-38 ''the Stray Lamb'' because ''she'' always brought him home. From 1946 he was an executive with Newell Manufacturing of which his father, Lawrence was a founder. In 1954 he started and was president of Dover Manufacturing, living for 40 years in Guilford, CT. In 1959 he & Janet packed up the entire family and traveled through Europe settling in Positano, Italy and renting Villa Viola. He taught himself to sculpt and cast in bronze, doing so for ten years. He was a director of the Newell Company (Newell Rubbermaid) from 1962 to 1995, and Chairman of the Board from 1976 to 1992. In 1989 he & Janet began wintering in Naples, FL, moving there in 1994. Bill & ''Lamb'' helped create and administrate ground - breaking organiza tions among others SARAH & the Philadelphia Piano Quartet. They made social and environmental contributions to The Institute on Man and Science, the Guilford Land Conservation Trust, & the Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary. He is survived by Janet; his sisters Betty-Jean Wood and Ellen Burt; his children William, Cynthia, Rodger and Elizabeth; ten grandchildren & five great grandchildren. Bill lived a happy and exciting life and he was full of curiosity to the end. Donations may be made to your local hospice or land trust.
