        RAHM-Herbert. The Brotherhood of Congregation Rodeph Sholom mourns the passing of our dear friend Herbert Rahm. Herb was a devoted member of the Brotherhood, Past Brotherhood President and Honorary Brotherhood President for life. He devoted himself to interfaith understanding as Chair of Jewish Chatauqua. His untiring efforts on behalf of Brotherhood and Chatauqua will serve as an inspiration to his friends and a commemoration of his memory.
