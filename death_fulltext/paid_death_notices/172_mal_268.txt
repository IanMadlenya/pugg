        SZULC-Tad. The staff of PARADE Magazine mourns the loss of a beloved friend and colleague. In his twenty years as foreign editor of PARADE, Tad Szulc made significant historical contributions, including the first interview with Pope John Paul II ever to be published in an American magazine. His very personal account of his illness, published just a few months ago, illustrated Szulc's strength of character, his commitment to family and friends and an unwavering faith. He will be deeply missed. We extend our sympathies to his loving wife, Marianne, his children and grandchildren. Walter Anderson, Publisher
