        SAXE--Eleanor (nee Ginsburg). On the occasion of Shloshim, the Officers, Board and staff of American Red Magen David for Israel express our profound condolences to Benjamin Saxe, our Executive Vice President Emeritus, on the loss of his wife, as well as to Emmett and his wife Sharon, on the loss of his mother. Eleanor loved the Jewish people and the State of Israel. Her acts of ''Gemilut Hasadim'' are legion. Each day, when Magen David Adom in Israel saves another life, Eleanor Saxe's legacy is being fulfilled. May her family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Robert L. Sadoff, Chairman of the Board Mark D. Lebow, Pres. Daniel R. Allen, Exec. V.P.
