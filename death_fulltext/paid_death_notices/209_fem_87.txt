        MARX--Erna (Kahn), passed away peacefully in her sleep early Sunday morning, June 13, 2004. Erna was the widow of the late Dr. Henry Marx (an accountant and professor). Dr. and Mrs. Marx escaped Germany during the Holocaust and came to New York. She remained a New York City resident until she moved to the Jewish Home for the Elderly in Fairfield, CT, 3 years ago. For the last 25 years, Erna devoted her efforts to the American Red Magen David of Israel. She was the president of the New York City Chapter for ARMDI and was an integral part of its fundraising activities. Erna was particularly helpful in assisting in the development of the Magen David Adom Blood Services Center in Ramat Gan, Israel. For her service, Erna received many awards from ARMDI over the years. Recently, Erna made a substantial contribution to ARMDI, which has named the Blood Fractionation Institute at the Blood Center in honor of Dr. and Mrs. Marx. Erna celebrated her 96th birthday this past week and was treated to a wonderful day of shopping, personal beauty and dinner with her loving and special companion care givers. Erna thoroughly enjoyed her final years at the Jewish Home with exceptional care, compassion and friendship due to a tremendous staff of nurses and caregivers. For more information contact Abraham L.
