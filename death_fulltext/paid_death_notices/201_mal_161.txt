        HAHN--Prof. Dr. Fred. At 97, on October 12, 2003. The Society for the History of Czechoslovak Jews, Inc., mourns the passing of its longtime Vice President, Fred Hahn. Old world gentleman and scholar, he was widely respected and beloved, an inspiration to generations, tireless and energetic, an intellectual light of Czech Jewish scholarship in America. May God comfort his daughters, Susan and Jeanette and their families among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
