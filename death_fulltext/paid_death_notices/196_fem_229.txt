        MEYER--Helen W. passed away peacefully in her sleep in San Francisco on May 25, 2003 several weeks after a severe stroke at age 92. Helen was born April 16, 1911, the youngest of six children of immigrant parents, Fanny & Frank Wallerstein. After completing studies to become a teacher for educationally handicapped children, she taught in NYC elementary schools for a number of years. In the early 1940's she married Dr. William C. Meyer and they moved to Pomona, CA where they lived for many years with Helen continuing her work as a special education teacher. After retirement she and ''Bill'' moved to Santa Barbara where they enjoyed sailing, tennis, a rich cultural life in music and theater and the congenial company of many friends and relatives. Although they had no children of their own, they became the favorite uncle and aunt to their nieces and nephews and played important roles in each of their lives. ''Bill'' died in 1983. Helen continued to live in Santa Barbara until 1998 when she relocated to Coventry Park Retirement Center in San Francisco to be near her close relatives. She is survived by many loving nieces and nephews and their children. For information contact Sinai Memorial Chapel, SF. >>AD#
