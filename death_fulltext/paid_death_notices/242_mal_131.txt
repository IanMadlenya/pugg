        SPIRA--Bernard. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society mourn the loss of Bernard Spira of Los Angeles. Mr. Spira was a beloved friend and Technion Guardian, representing the highest level of support of the Technion. His ardent support of ATS endeavors in Southern California will be greatly missed. Mr. Spira was formerly a design engineer for McDonnell Douglas Aircraft Corp. and a World War II veteran. To his cousin, Mrs. Yona Nadelman, we extend our heartfelt sympathy.

Bloom, Executive Vice President Charles Levin, Southern California Chapter President Nina Madden Sabban, Southern California Chapter Chair
