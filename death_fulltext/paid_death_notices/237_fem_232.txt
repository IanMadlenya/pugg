        LOEB--Muriel Menschel. After 93 years of loving and being loved by everyone whom she knew and who knew her, Mu Mu, died peacefully in what was her New York City home for over 50 years. A devoted wife to the late Richard Loeb, the perfect role model for her son, the late Alfred Loeb and daughter-in-law Judy Loeb Goldfein and a perpetual inspiration to her daughter Bonnie Chajet and her husband Clive Chajet and the perfect grandmother in every sense of the word to her grandchildren Lisa Chajet, Lori Chajet and Ben Wides and to Jeremy Loeb and her great-granddaughter Sonia. Her sisters Eleanor Snyder and Marilyn Elin deeply mourn the loss of their eldest sister. Graveside services will take place Monday, 1 PM, at Temple Israel Cemetery, 388 Saw Mill River Road, Hastings-on-the-Hudson, NY. The family will be observing shiva Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday from 4-9 PM.
