        SCIALO--Joseph Vincent. November 20, 2004 at age 69. Beloved Domestic Partner of Charlie Rice. Adoring brother of Caroline Mazza & Vincenza Perino. Born July 2, 1935, he grew up in New York's Little Italy. In 1970 he purchased a small restaurant in Cherry Grove, Fire Island where he found his life's work. He named this restaurant The Monster and continued the success in Key West & to the current location in Greenwich Village. His easy sense of humor and vitality made him a persuasive force, an effective and much loved businessman. After a distinguished career lasting 34 years, there is no doubt that the L.G.B.T. & Straight community has lost one of its brightest lights. Joe died at home due to complications from Emphysema and sudden heart failure. A Celebration of his life will be held at the Manhattan Monster, December 5, 2004 between 1 and 4PM. In lieu of flowers to Joe's memory please make contributions to a special place he loved, Dunes Fund Cherry Grove Fire Island (Dunes Fund, Inc., P. O. Box 4141, Cherry Grove, New York 11782).
