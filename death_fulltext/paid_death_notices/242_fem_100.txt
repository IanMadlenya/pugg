        FRIEDMAN--A. Lisa, Ph.D., Eminent psychologist. Beloved wife of Bill for 66 years, cherished mother and mother-in-law of Susanne, Nina, Paul, Myron and Jean, nonny and grandnonny, died on March 10, 2007, aged 88. Born May 2, 1918 into a poor, working class, Sephardic Jewish family in New York City and forced by the Depression to leave college, Lisa went on to become Valedictorian of her Nursing class at Lebanon Hospital in 1939. While raising three teenagers, she completed both her Masters degree in Counseling and Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology at NYU. Lisa was a pioneer in the field of Multiple Family Marathon Therapy. She was a disciple of Danica Deutsch, the daughter of Alfred Adler, completing her internship at the Alfred Adler Institute in New York City. Lisa earned the highest distinction in her profession by earning the Diplomate in Marriage and Family Counseling. At the age of 80, she attained a degree in Neuropharmacology and continued to practice well into her 80s. Influenced in her early years by the Depression and the fight against fascism, she followed in the tradition of her activist, immigrant parents. Her personal and professional lives merged as she became an advocate for the poor and those who were not given a fair start in life. Drawing on her own life's struggles, embraced by a loving family, Lisa fervently believed in the capacity of the individual to overcome adversity and turn obstacles into stepping stones toward a rich, meaningful and purposeful life.
