She was the devoted wife of the late Jack Rein. Ethel is survived by a large and loving family, which includes her sons Herbert (Susan) and Lawrence (Sheila), six grandchildren, 14 great-grandchildren, sister-inlaw Eileen and numerous nephews and nieces. Ethel was a wonderful daughter to Frieda and Joseph Deutsch. She was a cherished sister to Gussie, Gertie, Harry and Eddie, all of whom pre-deceased her. Ethel was a meticulous person who will be remembered as being lovely and who never said a bad word about anyone.
