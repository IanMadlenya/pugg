        BERTELSMANN-Heinz O. The Bard College community deeply mourns the passing of Heinz O. Bertelsmann, professor emeritus and longtime friend of the college. For more than 30 years he shared his keen intellect and deep humanity with Bard's students and faculty as a professor of international relations. Over the past two decades the vitality, dedication, and generosity of Heinz and his wife Lilo continued to play an essential role in the life of the college. We extend our deepest condolences to Lilo and to his entire family. He will be sorely missed. Leon Botstein, President David E. Schwab II, Chairman
