        PEERS-Vincent of Spring Hill, FL. A longtime resident of Massaqequa, NY, he was 75 when he died on Monday, September 11, of complications related to his heart and lungs. Vincent retired as a pressman from The New York Times and Daily News, where he was well known for his sense of humor and strong work ethic. He never let a day go by without doing the Times' crossword puzzle and any others he could find. Vincent served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and felt a strong, unwavering allegiance to his country. After moving to Florida in 1989, Vincent co-founded the Delta Woods Bocci Club and was an avid player, winning several awards. He made quick and fast friends with his club mates and the members of his church and the New York Club. Vincent leaves behind many friends both in Florida and in New York. He lived for his wife, children, and grandchildren. Vincent leaves his wife, Dolores; children Clare, Gerard, Dolores, Vincent, and Joanne; his daughterin-law, Marla; his sons-in-law Tim, Scott, and Harry; and his truly adoring and adored grandchildren, Stessa, Jacey, Aram, Andrew, Carrie, and Tatiana Rose. His children and grandchildren are grateful for having been given the gift of spending his last weeks with him. Vincent also leaves his sisters, Frances (Sr. Clare) Ellen, and Rosemary; and his brothers, George and Joe (a brother, William (Fr. Bill), predeceased him.) Vincent Peers was cremated and buried in Florida on Friday after a Catholic service. In lieu of flowers please send donations to the Ronald McDonald House in his memory.
