        STEWART--Charles T. The YMCA of Greater New York mourns the loss of Charles T. Stewart, a lifelong volunteer, advocate and friend. Chuck was a gentleman of generous commitment and wise counsel, with over four decades as a volunteer, including as our Chairman of the Board 198286. The thoughts and prayers of his YMCA family are with Chucks loved ones as we join in celebration of a life rich in service to New York's kids, families and communities.
