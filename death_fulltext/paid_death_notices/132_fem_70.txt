        LLOYD-Marie. The Board of Directors of the William Matheus Sullivan Foundation acknowledges with great sadness the death of their friend and colleague, Marie Lloyd. She played a significant part in the growth and effectiveness of the Foundation in nurturing the careers of young American singers, and we extend our heartfelt sympathy to her husband, her son and her grandchildren. We will miss her generous spirit and good company.
