        GREEN--James Wilder. The Judith Rothschild Foundation mourns the death of Wilder Green, the permanent Chairman of its Grants Review Committee. Wilder served the Foundation with great vision and dedication and, like Palinurus, brilliantly guided the annual jury deliberation process. He was also a wonderful friend and counselor to us all. We will miss him enormously.
