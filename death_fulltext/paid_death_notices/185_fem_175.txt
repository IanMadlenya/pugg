        CITRIN-Estelle Claire. After Hillary died I knew you would not be with us for long. Having children of my own now, I now understand why you had to go and be with her. Although your grandsons Ethan and Hunter have never met you, they are each filled with your spirit, your love of life, your sense of humor and your love of shopping. Twenty years have come and gone, and you are never far from my heart, Mommy. Love Always, Marc, Arnold and Family
