        MEYER-Sylvia Frances of Roslyn, NY, died at the age of eighty. Her family is mourning the loss of their matriarch. She used her home as a waypoint for all relatives entering America and she remains the unifier of a family that spans the globe. Sylvia had a unique quality that made each relative feel she was closer to them than any other. She served as the historian linking us to our past. She graduated from medical school in Johannesburg at twenty-two years old and six months pregnant. Her career began in Johannesburg where she practiced medicine for eighteen years before moving to England in 1961 where she was involved in the administration of public health. In 1966 she and her husband moved to NY where she became the Medical Director of Patient Services in numerous hospitals including the Rockaways. She retired in 1987. She was a taskmaster who obstinately held her course and sometimes to her loved ones' dismay, held their's as well. She believed in what was right and refused to compromise. She championed the rights of the underprivileged and the oppressed in South Africa, crossing picket lines to care for their lives. She left when she saw no promise. She broke boundaries and became a doctor in an age when few women could. She is survived by her husband of morethan sixty years, Dr. Morris (Jack) Meyer; by her dearly beloved son, Dr. Steven Meyer and his wife Ann; by her grandchildren, Saul and Susan and Saul's wife, Adriana, all of Dallas; by her sister, Ruth Jacobs and by her nephews, Anthony, Mark and Michael Raissen and Michael, Howard and Barry Jacobs as well as many close friends, all of whom she loved deeply. Funeral services will be held in Dallas, TX on Wednesday, April 17. In lieu of flowers donations may be made in her name to the Holocaust Studies Program at UTD c/o The Advancement Office, PO Box 830688, MP13, Richardson, TX, 75083-0688.
