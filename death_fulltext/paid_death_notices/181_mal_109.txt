        FRACCHIA-Alfred A., M.D. The staff of the Department of Surgery and Breast Surgery Service of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center notes with sadness the death of their colleague, Dr. Alfred Fracchia. Dr. Fracchia's career at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center began as a Surgical Fellow in 1950. From 1950-1998, he brightened the outlook for his patients. Today's patients benefit from his many years of devoted service. He will be missed. We extend our deepest sympathy to his family.
