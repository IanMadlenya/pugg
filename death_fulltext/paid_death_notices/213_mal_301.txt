        MALAMUD--Daniel I. On October 20, 2004 in Issaquah, WA. Loving and loved husband of Ann, father of Judy and Mark, father-in-law of Susan, and grandfather of Jasper. A caring psychotherapist and innovative teacher. His life was guided by an inner loving sweetness, though he often professed misanthropic and nihilistic sentiments. His ironic humor and creativity will be deeply missed by family, friends, and patients.
