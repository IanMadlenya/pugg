        BODMAN-John Morgan Jr. (Jack). Age 60. On February 16, 2003. Devoted father to Pierre M. Bodman. Suddenly taken away from the ones he loved. A spirited and whimsical mind, he was a lover of peace and reconciliation. He served as an Air Force Captain during the Viet Nam War and was also a true environmentalist. Much of his time and energy was spent fondly developing the Land Conservation Trust of Salem, Connecticut, where he resided. He will be greatly missed by all who knew him as a kind, loyal and dignified man. A service to honor and celebrate Jack's life will take place in May at the family cemetery (Mosswood Glen at Music Vale).
