        BUBLICK-Judith S. Peacefully, on Oct 5, 1997. Cherished partner and wife of the late David Bublick, dear mother of Linda, Aaron; truly magical, deeply beloved grandmother of David and Peter. Writer for old-time radio, poet, painter, world traveler; her enthusiasm never waned. Her wit and humor, her unfailing generosity, and her blithe spirit will be forever missed.
