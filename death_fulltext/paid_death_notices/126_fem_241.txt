        LOCKETZ-Rebecca Lee, age 41. The Board of Trustees and Staff of the ACLU mourn the sudden death of a friend and colleague, Rebecca L. Locketz. She was a trailblazer in the field of workplace rights and genetic testing, and a dedicated community leader who was often described as ''a feminist, lesbian activist committed to social change.'' Her warmth, love of life and generosity -not to mention an unswerving commitment to civil liberties -will be sorely missed by her many friends. The ACLU sends our deepest condolences to her partner, Pearl Balla, and her family. Funeral service will be held at 7:30 P.M., today at the Flemington Jewish Community Center, Flemington, New Jersey.
