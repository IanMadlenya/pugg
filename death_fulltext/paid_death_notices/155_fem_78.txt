        TOBIN-Rae Katz. Age 85, died on Monday, Nov. 29, 1999. The light in Rae's eyes shone with intelligence, love, good humor and wit. With heart and mind, she nurtured her family, fought for a better world and nursed her husband Mike through his terrible battle with Alzheimer's. She left the world a better place. We'll miss this warm and wonderful woman. Rae is survived by her sister Norma Katz Menter, her son Daniel, her daughter and son-in-law Susan and John Schoonover and grandchildren Carl, Danny and Julie. Contributions to Alzheimer's Association, 360 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10017.
