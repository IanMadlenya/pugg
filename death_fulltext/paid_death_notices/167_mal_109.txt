        MCCRAY-Porter A. The trustees, staff, fellows, and extended family of the Asian Cultural Council are deeply saddened by the loss of Porter McCray, who for so many years was such an extraordinary colleague, mentor, and friend. Porter was a cultural advisor to members of several generations of the Rockefeller family, and between 1947 and 1961 he developed and directed the domestic and international circulating exhibition programs at The Museum of Modern Art. In 1963 he was appointed founding director of The JDR 3rd Fund (now the Asian Cultural Council), a foundation which was created by John D. Rockefeller 3rd to promote cultural exchanges in the visual and performing arts between Asia and the United States and which Porter led with remarkable vision, dedication, and care. The uniquely effective model of grantmaking that Porter established nearly forty years ago continues to form the basis of our work at the Asian Cultural Council today. Throughout a brilliant professional career in the cultural and philanthropic worlds that spanned more than six decades, Porter was a tireless and enthusiastic champion of many of the most talented artists and arts specialists of our time, and the lives of countless individuals here and abroad have been profoundly touched by his great generosity, encouragement, and advice. An inveterate international traveler and superb connoisseur, Porter will also always be remembered as a true gentleman whose impeccable manners and unfailing good taste set a wonderful example for all who knew him. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his sister Frances Jacob and his grandniece Frances Blades. A memorial service will be held at 4:00 PM on January 23, 2001, at the Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, NY, NY 10017. In lieu of flowers, contributions in Porter's memory may be made to the American Cancer Society, (1800-ACS-2345). Elizabeth J. McCormack Chairman Richard S.
