        DiCAPUA - Marie. Lost her struggle with cancer after a valiant two year fight. Aided by her daughter Maria Sicurelli Wist, she searched for a cure and participated in experimental treatments all over the world. Through her illness she never lost hope that these experimental therapies would help others, always putting everyone before herself. A former N.Y.C. school teacher, she touched lives here and abroad that she probably never even realized. Fighting for two years without a complaint, always a smile and loving word of advice she left a void that can never be filled. Mommy, you will always be my life. You were my angel on earth. She is survived by her devoted parents Anthony and Carmela DiCapua, broken hearted children, Maria Sicurelli Wist, Camille Sicurelli, Dr. Robert Sicurelli and Anthony Sicurelli; a loving sister Lucy Hartnett and brother Peter DiCapua; eight adoring grandchildren; nieces and nephews. Funeral Mass today, 10:15 A.M., at Our Lady of Angels, 7320 4th Avenue, Brooklyn, New York 11209. Maria Sicurelli Wist Andrew Wist (loving son-in-law) Milton & Ariana Wist (grandchildren)
