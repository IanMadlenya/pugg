        BRENNAN-Edward, M.D. The Executive Committee, faculty, staff and candidates of the Columbia University Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research, express our deepest sorrow over the death of our esteemed colleague, Edward Brennan, M.D. He brought a profound dedication and quiet authority to his psychoanalytic work. He will be greatly missed by his patients, his students and colleagues, and all of us who benefitted from his warmth, his strength, and his integrity. We extend our sympathy to his wife Alice, his children, Elizabeth, Noel and Alison and his grandchildren, Claire, Molly and Caroline. Robert A. Glick, M.D. Director
