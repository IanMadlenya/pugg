        GOELET-Francis. The Board and staff of the Metropolitan Opera Guild join the musical world in mourning the death of our friend, Francis Goelet. First elected to the Guild's board of directors in 1952 at the age of 27, he served with distinction and contributed significantly to the Guild. In 1987 he was elected a director emeritus, serving as such until his death. His love and deep knowledge of music was remarkable as was his great generosity to the Metropolitan Opera. His support through commissioning of music in the second half of the 20th century was particularly noteworthy. To many of us at the Guild, he was a good friend and he will be sorely missed. We extend to his family and friends our deepest symmpathy. The Metropolitan Opera Guild
