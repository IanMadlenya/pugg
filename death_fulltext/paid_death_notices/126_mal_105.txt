        KEEFE-Jeremiah J., J.D. The Board of Directors and members of the New York State Society of Internal Medicine are saddened by the passing of our Executive Director, Jeremiah J. Keefe, J.D., who served Internists in organized medicine for twenty-six years. He actively represented Internists at the state and national levels and was New York's liaison with the American Society of Internal Medicine. He was extremely knowledgeable about issues related to the practice of medicine and was a strong voice for the rights and responsibilities of internal medicine practitioners. Jeremiah Keefe was a graduate of Fordham Law School and maintained a practice in health law in addition to responsibilities on behalf of the society. He leaves many friends in organized medicine and will be missed. Robert Westlake, Jr., M.D., President, New York State Society of Internal Medicine
