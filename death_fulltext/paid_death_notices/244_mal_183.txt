        BERMAN--Meyer. The Yeshiva University/RIETS family is deeply saddened by the passing of a major supporter of our institution, a YU Guardian who, together with his brother, Rabbi Julius (and Dorothy) Berman, established the Rabbi Henoch and Sarah D. Berman Chair in Talmud at the Gruss Institute in Jerusalem in memory of their parents. Heartfelt condolences are extended to his wife, Katya, to his children: Andrew (and Debby) Berman, Avigail (and Yitzchak) Handel, and Lynn Berman; and to his siblings, YU Trustee and RIETS Board Chairman, Julius (and Dorothy) Berman, YU Benefactors; Tobias (and Rosalie) Berman, YU Benefactors; and Esther Rubin. May the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Richard M. Joel, President Norman Lamm, Chancellor Morry Weiss, Chairman YU Board of Trustees Hyman Arbesfeld and Herbert Smilowitz, Vice Chairmen RIETS Board of Trustees
