        KUPFERMAN--Theodore R. Judge Kupferman, rest in peace. You had a wonderful and honest life and I learned so much from you. May you rest in heaven, too. Since you left the appellate division, everything in New York City and New York State is very disappointing. And there are very few judges that remain in your honest class. Our city and state are in a tragic condition, but the great obituary in The New York Times and supported in The New York Law Journal reveals one very good solution, your punch line, ''It does not take Gertrude Stein to know that a contract is a contract is a contract.'' And hopefully with your words this basic law will be reinstated in the minds of all of the state's political leaders. Judge Kupferman, rest in peace. Your honesty and dignity I learned from and followed all of my life. I will die with it. When I get there with you, let's leave it a dignified world. All of your family is certainly proud of your 100% honesty. Sincerely, Abraham J. Hirschfeld
