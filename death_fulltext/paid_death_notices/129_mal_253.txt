        MCGILL-William J. On behalf of the entire University community, the President and Trustees of Columbia University express deep sorrow at the passing of President Emeritus William J. McGill. Dr. McGill assumed the responsibilities of President and Trustee at a time of student unrest and severe fiscal crisis. During the next decade, he won the confidence of students and faculty, brought calm to the campus and financial stability to the University, and engendered in the academic community a forward-looking and optimistic attitude for the future of the University. The dedication, stamina and administrative genius that characterized Dr. McGill's tenure earned the respect and admiration of the academic world. Columbia University extends profound sympathy to his beloved wife Ann and family. George Rupp, President Stephen Friedman, Chair of the Trustees
