        MONTAG--Mildred. Adelphi University mourns the passing of Dr. Mildred Montag. From 1943-1948 she shared her knowledge, vision and commitment to educational excellence with the Adelphi community as the first director of the School of Nursing. She was a visionary nurse educator whose innovative research and inspired teaching led to an unprecedented expansion of the nursing profession, bringing countless benefits to the health and well-being of generations. Our thoughts are with her friends and family. Robert A. Scott, President Steven N. Fischer, Chairman, Board of Trustees
