        ATKINS-Thomas. The Hunter College community is sadden to learn of the death of Dr. Thomas Atkins, who served as Chief Librarian at Hunter from 1991-1995. Professor Atkins was a scholar committed to learning, an innovator who helped usher the new technology into our libraries, and an educator and humanitarian deeply concerned about the students whose intellectual growth depends so much on libraries. We send our sincerest condolences to his family. David A. Caputo, President Hunter College
