        HERSHFIELD--George. Oscar Heyman & Brothers mourns the passing of our esteemed emeritus employee. George was a constant breath of fresh air with an ebullient attitude and a radiant perspective of life and people. George was a kind and caring close friend to many of us and we valued his insight and his energy. He was always there for us and his demeanor was the consummate gentleman.
