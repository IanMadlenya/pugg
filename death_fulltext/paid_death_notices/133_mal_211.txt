        RUBIN-Dr. Ira Lloyd. The Department of Medicine and the Cardiovascular Division of Montefiore Medical Center and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine mourn the death of Dr. Ira L. Rubin, Emeritus Professor of Clinical Medicine. Dr. Rubin served Montefiore for almost 60 years and was a member of the Einstein Faculty for over 30 years. His contributions to our institutions have been numerous and invaluable. Among the many important roles that he played was service as acting Medical Director of Montefiore's Morrisania City Hospital Service, Director of Montefiore's Medical Residency Program, and President of the Montefiore Medical Board. As a consummate cardiologist with a worldwide recognition, he authored numerous books and research articles on electrocardiography, and for over 35 years was Director of Electrocardiography at Montefiore. Dr. Rubin taught electrocardiography to countless numbers of cardiology fellows, medical residents and students. But above all, his kind and thoughtful manner, while practicing the very highest level of academic cardiology, made him a role model to young physicians and to peers, as he exemplified the very best personal and professional standards. A giant on our faculty has left us. He will be missed by all. Our deepest condolences to his wife, Bea. Dr. James Scheuer, Chairman Dr. Joan I. Casey, Vice Chairman Dr. J. Anthony Ware, Chief, Cardiovascular Division Dr. John D. Fisher, Director Montefiore Cardiology.
