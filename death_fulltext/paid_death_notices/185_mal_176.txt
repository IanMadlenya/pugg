        BLASS-Bill. The Trustees and staff of The New York Public Library deeply mourn the passing of one of the most cherished members of the Library family, Bill Blass. A devoted Trustee, a most generous benefactor, a warm and wise friend, and a sage counselor, Bill Blass embraced with enthusiasm and promoted with flair the Library's role of transmitting the world's cultural record to an ever-expanding audience. As was the case in his business, Mr. Blass did everything at the Library with great personal style, with wit, and with charm. He was a leader in every way-creatively, entrepreneurially, and philanthropically-and in 1994 the Trustees named one of the Library's grandest spaces the Bill Blass Public Catalog Room in honor of his many contributions to the Library and its program. Bill Blass was deeply loved by us all, and he will be greatly missed. Mrs. Vincent Astor, Honorary Chairman Samuel C.

        BLASS-Bill. The patients and staff of the Center for Special Studies of the New York Presbyterian Hospital mourn the loss of one of our guiding lights. During the earliest days of the epidemic, he committed to help those not only physically devastated but also cruelly stigmatized by HIV disease. One of the ways he expressed that commitment was through his quiet, generous and steadfast support of our program. We will miss his leadership, kindness, wise counsel and above all, wonderful friendship.
