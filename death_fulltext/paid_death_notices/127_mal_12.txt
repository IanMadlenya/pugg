        ZARETSKY-Professor Barry. It is with deep sorrow that the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of New York notes the passing of Barry Zaretsky. We shall always be grateful for his invaluable contributions to the interpretation of bankruptcy law as reflected in his many articles and treatises and his participation in bankruptcy panels and seminars throughout the country. We recognize the part he played as a Professor of Bankruptcy in Brooklyn Law School and the sterling example he set as a mentor to his students, many of whom served as our law clerks as well as those who have appeared in our court as competent, able attorneys. We shall miss him. Conrad B. Duberstein Chief Bankruptcy Judge
