        HORWITZ-Irma. The National Society For Hebrew Day Schools mourns the loss of Mrs. Irma Horwitz who for more than four decades headed the National Associations of Hebrew Day Schools PTAs an affiliate of Torah Umesorah. Irma's father the late lamented Mr. Samuel C. Feuerstein z''l, together with Rabbi Shraga Feivel Mendlowitz, founded Torah Umesorah in 1944. The Day School movement as envisioned by its illustrious founders is today universally recognized as the most indespensible tool in the effort to stem the tide of assimilation in our time. Irma lead a cadre of like minded volunteers who traveled the length and breadth of this country to help establish and strengthen Hebrew Day Schools. This movement today numbers 567 schools and more than 160,000 students. Irma's brillant mind, untiring dedication and inspiring spirit will continue to bear fruits for many years to come. May her memory be a blessing. Torah Umesorah Mr. David Singer, Chairman of the Board Rabbi Joshua Fishman, Executive Vice President Dr. Shmuel Zentman, Treasurer
