        SHAFER - Frederick Q. The trustees, faculty, administration, alumni/AE of Bard College mourn the passing of Frederick Quentin Shafer '36, former chaplain of the college and Bernard Iddings Bell Professor Emeritus of Philosophy and Religion. His life and work were closely bound together with Bard, a place to which he was deeply committed and to which he devoted nearly 60 years of his life. He exemplified the aspirations and spirit of this institution. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Margaret Creal Shafer and to his children and grandchildren. Leon Botstein, President David E. Schwab II, Chairman, Board of Trustees
