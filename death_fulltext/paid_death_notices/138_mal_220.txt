        CLARKE-John Henrik. The Hunter College community notes with sadness the passing of John Henrik Clarke, a distinguished, selftaught and outspoken scholar. Founder and former Chairman of the Hunter College Black and Puerto Rican Studies Department, prolific author and editor, Mr. Clarke revolutionized the field of African studies with his brilliant and iconoclastic writings. Hunter has been privileged to benefit from his wise teaching and ardent advocacy of incorporating African history and culture into the context of world history. We extend our condolences to his family.
