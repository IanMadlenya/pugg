        ORTIZ-Rita A. The Faculty, Advisory Council, Alumni Association, students and staff of the Columbia University School of Social Work are deeply saddened at the death of Rita Ortiz, former assistant professor and member of the Class of '47. A distinguished alumna and respected social worker and teacher for nearly half a century, she made invaluable contributions as a leader in the Puerto Rican community and in her profession. The Gonzalez Memorial Scholarship she established at the School in 1989 in memory of her brother, Agustin Gonzalez, will be a lasting tribute to their joint commitment to meet the social and educational needs of Hispanic populations. A beloved friend and esteemed colleague, she will be missed by all who knew her. Sincerest condolences are extended to her family. Ronald A. Feldman, Dean
