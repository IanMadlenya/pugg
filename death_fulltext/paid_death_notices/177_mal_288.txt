        LESER-Jacques. Of Manhattan, formerly of Mt. Vernon, at the age of 88 after a long courageous battle with Alzheimer's disease on October 19, 2001. After serving in the Belgian Army, Mr. Leser, a native of Antwerp, emigrated to the United States in 1941 and re-established the family business as diamond merchants in New York. He is remembered as an astute and charitable businessman with a tireless entrepreneurial spirit and reputation for integrity and keen foresight; which made him a prince of the international rough diamond trade from the 1940's to the 1980's. Adoring husband for 43 years of the late Tinia. He is survived by his loving children: Liliane (Nathaniel) Karol, Shirley (Michael) Heitler, Robert (Hilary) Leser and grandchildren-David, Jordan, Gabrielle, Nicole, Benjamin and Sophie. His brother Arnold Leser of Tel Aviv and sister Regine Silberman of Oklahoma City also survive him. Jacques loved his family, travel, the arts, gardening, a good dog and the clever little things one finds in life. Now and forever at peace. Family requests that in lieu of flowers contributions may be made to the Alzheimer's Association of New York. Funeral services 11:15 AM, Tuesday, October 23, at ''The Riverside,'' 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue.
