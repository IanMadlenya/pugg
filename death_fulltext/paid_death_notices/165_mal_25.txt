        NAGASHIMA-Hideo, M.D. Professor Emeritus at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, died on September 29 at St. Agnes Hospital in White Plains. He was 70. He was predeceased by his first wife Olga and is survived by his second wife Sachiko; his three sons, Robert, Hidalgo, and Richard; a brother, Yasuo of Tokyo, Japan; and his grandchildren Arthur and Carson. Dr. Nagashima, a pioneering anesthesiologist, helped to develop the careers of countless young Japanese anesthesiologists. He acted as mentor and ''father'' to many young anesthesiologists coming from Japan who had spent one or more fellowship years at Montefiore. Dr. Nagashima was born in Yokosuka City, Japan, on September 9, 1930. He completed his medical degree at Yokohama University School of Medicine in 1957, and that year came to New York, where he began an internship at Fordham Hospital. After completing his internship in 1958, he began his residency training and fellowship at Montefiore Hospital in anesthesiology, beginning a 42-year career there. In 1962, he joined the Montefiore Hospital attending staff and was appointed as an Instructor in Anesthesiology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in 1964. In 1979, Dr. Nagashima achieved the rank of Professor, and was elected membership in the prestigious Association of University Anesthesiologists. He has had a distinguished and fruitful career at Montefiore Hospital. He has been loved and admired by his colleagues, friends, and especially his family. We are deeply saddened, and he will truly be missed. He was a true gentleman in every sense of the word. A ceremony honoring his memory will be held on Wednesday at McMahon, Lyon & Hartnett Funeral Home, Inc., 491 Mamaroneck Avenue, White Plains, NY 10605, (914-949-7777) at 4:30 PM, with visiting hours from 46. An additional memorial service will be held at Montefiore Hospital and will be announced at a later date.
