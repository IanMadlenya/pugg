        CASHIN-Bonnie. The California Institute of Technology feels privileged to have been a focus of fashion designer Bonnie Cashin's interest during the past 22 years of her life. She was intrigued by the confluence of art and science and encouraged our students to maximize their creativity. She generously established a lecture series, a scholarship and even the Bonnie Cashin Prize for Imaginative Thinking at Cal Tech. How fortunate we were to have been the recipient of her philanthropy. Her enthusiasm and sense of adventure endeared her to the Institute and will be sorely missed.
