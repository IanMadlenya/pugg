        WISE-Harold. We deeply mourn the loss of our dear friend Harold and send to June and Shera our deepest expression of love. Harold was a mentor to so many of us and left a far reaching legacy. He founded the Residency Program in Social Medicine at Montefiore, the first of its kind in the country. He founded & directed the Martin Luther King Health Center in the Bronx, which was one of the first community health centers in the country and was a model for providing healthcare to the poor which is in use to the present day. Harold taught us that healthcare needs to be delivered in people friendly settings in communities; as opposed to in hospital settings. He developed the concepts of the community health worker and the healthcare team. Harold was an early pioneer of family centered healthcare. He founded the Valentine Lane Health Practice, one of the first health practices to use collaboration between medical and psychosocial providers. He brilliantly incorporated complimentary health practices in his medical practice. Traditional boundaries could not contain Harold, he was so far ahead in so many areas. A true healer, his light improved so many of us that it touched. We love you Harold and miss you terribly. John Falencki and Steven Tamarin Friends and Family Physicians, NYC NY County Chapter of the AAFP
