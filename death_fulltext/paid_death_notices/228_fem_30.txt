        KEENE--Constance. The Leschetizky Association deeply regrets the passing of its beloved Vice President and friend. Her unfailing generosity and adherence to the highest standard of pianistic excellence were a mainstay of the Association's activities. We extend deepest condolences to her family, and will miss her immensely.
