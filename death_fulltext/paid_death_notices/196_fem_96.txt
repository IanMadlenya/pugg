She is survived by her husband Alexander who unconditionally loved and actively cared for her. She leaves three of her sisters, Natalie, Florence, and Betty. She is also survived by her three sons and their wives, Mitchell and Gerry, Leonard and Helene; and Maury and Georgina; her six grandchildren, Stefanie, Ian, Adam, Robyn, Zachary and Jordan; and her one great-grandchild, Isaac.
