        ISAACS-Norman E. For all of the students, faculty and alumni who knew and respected Norman Isaacs, we note his death with sadness. As an outstanding newspaper editor, president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, and chairman of the National News Council, he was a leading figure in American journalism. As editor-in-residence and associate dean at the Journalism School, he infused us with his passion for high standards in the pursuit of truth, especially in the face of political intimidation. We extend our condolences to our colleague, Prof. Stephen D. Isaacs, and his family. Tom Goldstein, Dean Joan Konner, Dean Emerita Sandy Padwe, Associate Dean and the Faculty of the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism
