        DEANE-Hugh Gordon, Jr, 84, a journalist, died June 25. He wrote two books, ''Good Deeds and Gunboats'' and ''The Korean War 1945-1953'' and contributed to The Nation, Christian Science Monitor and others. He was a founder of the U.S.-China Peoples Friendship Association and chief editor of its U.S. China Review. After Harvard, he travelled to China and wrote a ten-part series for the Monitor reporting that the Quomintang was losing support. Ten years later, he was blacklisted, a victim of the notion that conspiring Americans had lost China. From 1960-1986, he was associate editor and then editor of the Hotel Voice, a union newspaper. In 1963, he wrote one of the first anti-war critiques in ''The War in Vietnam'' with a forward by Bertrand Russell. Born in Springfield, MA, he was a descendant of Francis Cooke, a member of the Mayflower company. He was preceded in death by his wife Beverley and his daughter Winifred Deane Goldblatt. Survivors include his sons, Gordon and Michael; a brother Richard and two grandchildren, Julian Goldblatt and Greta Deane . A memorial service will be held on September 23 at The Ethical Culture Society, 4 West 64th Street, New York City, at 1 PM.
