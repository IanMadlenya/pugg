        WANG--C.C. The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn the passing of artist and collector, C.C. Wang, who was a Benefactor of the Museum for over nearly thirty years. Our galleries have been permanently enriched by dozens of the Chinese paintings--representing a wide range of periods and styles--that he collected with his discerning eye, and one of the rooms in the Asian Art wing bears his name. We extend our sympathies to his entire family. He will be greatly missed. James R. Houghton Chairman Philippe de Montebello Director David E. McKinney President >>AD#
