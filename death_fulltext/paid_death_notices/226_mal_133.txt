        FREUMAN--Henry, MD. Adored, cherished and beloved husband of Carol, father of David and Daniel, brother of Reuven and grandfather of Jason. Strong, elegant and a man of immeasurable grace, Henry brought enormous love to his family, intellectual rigor to his academic interests, and a brave heart to all of the challenges he met in life. After surviving the Holocaust, Henry immigrated to Israel and received his medical degree from Hadassah Medical School in Jerusalem. Affiliated with Lenox Hill and Beth Israel Kings Highway Hospitals, he provided compassionate care to his gynecological patients for over 40 years. His life is his inspired legacy to us. Funeral services Friday, November 11, 9:30 am at ''The Riverside'' 76 Street and Amsterdam Avenue. Donations in his memory may be made to The Lymphoma Research Foundation, 111 Broadway, 19th Floor, NYC 10006. His delightful presence will remain with us forever.
