        GILBERT--John Nathan. On March 11, 2005, at the age of 87. Beloved husband of Wilma. Cherished uncle of nine. Formerly of Wabash, IN, he resided in New York for many years. An actuary by vocation, his real love was music, in which he was active as choir director, church organist, pianist and singer. We will miss his wry wit, his gentle nature, the richness of his intellect and his boundless generosity. A memorial service will be held Wednesday evening, March 30, 7 pm, at the Advent Lutheran Church, 93rd Street and Broadway.
