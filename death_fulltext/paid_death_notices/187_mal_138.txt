        MARCUS-Frank W. On August 10, 2002 at age 88. Survived by his devoted wife of 62 years, Harriet, and their sons, Carl and William, Carl's wife, Karin, and grandchildren Halimah and Noori. Frank was loved by many, and had many friends. He was unfailingly charming, generous, sharp and expected the best of himself and others. He excelled at whatever he did. In the 30's, he brought his family from Germany to the U.S. and founded Harold Leonard and Co. (Halco) in NYC, which grew under his guidance to become a top company in the restaurant supplies industry. He retired in 1997. He was also championship bridge player in Westchester County. All of us will miss him.
