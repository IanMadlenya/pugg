        MAHLER-Eugene. Will always be remembered by Aunt Sunny, Michael, Susan, Stu (cat gut), Darin, Dani, and Julie Rosenberg and family. We will never forget his incredible storytelling. I only wish we could have written them down as only he could tell them. Thank you, Gene, for treating me as an equal while growing up. What you said was very meaningful and truly made a difference in my life. Heartfelt condolences to all. Love, Susan
