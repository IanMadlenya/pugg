        POTOK-Rabbi Chaim. We mourn with profound sorrow the passing of our beloved colleague. After ordination, he was the director of the leadership Training Fellowship at JTS and then became director of Camp Ramah in California before embarking upon his illustrious career as a writer. Author of The Chosen, The Promise and My Name is Asher Lev, he was devoted to Judaic scholarship and was the editor of the fivevolume JPS Torah Commentary and one of the editors of the Conservative Movement's Etz Hayim Torah Commentary. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Adena, children, Akiva, Naama and Rena, sisters Bella Sobolofsky and Charlotte (Rabbi Lester) Hering and to all who were touched through his rabbinate. Rabbi Reuven Hammer, Pres Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Executive Vice President The Rabbinical Assembly
