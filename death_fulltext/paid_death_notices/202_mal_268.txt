        WACHENHEIM--Edgar, Jr. With great love and sadness, we mourn the passing of Edgar Wachenheim Jr., on November 25, 2003 at the age of 96. Beloved husband of Elizabeth Marshall Wachenheim. Devoted father of Scott and Edgar III. He is also survived by a sister, Jessie Burack, seven grandchildren, and four great grandchildren. He loved his family, friends, and community--and he was a constant source of joy to all whose lives he touched. He devoted a good part of his life to helping those in need-and, as a result, he left the world a better place. His unselfish generosity, passion for life, and wise counsel will be greatly missed by all. A service to celebrate Ed's life will be held 10:30 A.M. on Sunday, December 14, 2003 at The Beach Point Club, 900 Rushmore Avenue, Mamaroneck, New York. In lieu of flowers, please make a donation to The Edgar Wachenheim Jr Endowment Fund, The Guidance Center, 70 Grand St., New Rochelle, NY 10801.
        WACHENHEIM--Edgar, Jr., The Board of Governors and members of Beach Point Club note with deep sorrow the passing of our fellow member, Edgar Wachenheim, Jr., and extend sincere condolences to his family. Alex C. Solowey, President
