        CUNEO-Mathilda Miller. We deeply mourn the passing of our distinguished Trustee of 45 years, and benefactor of the BronxRiverdale YM-YWHA, Mathilda Miller Cuneo. As a Trustee, Mathilda's dream was to ''burn the Y's mortgage.'' Her dream was realized on Monday, June 23, at the 88th annual meeting of the Y. A great woman will be missed by all. Our sincerest condolences to her son Richard and the entire family. Jeffrey A. Moerdler, President Harry M. Feder, Chairman Gerald Goldsmith, Hon. Chairman Diane Rubin, Executive Director
