        WENG-Virginia Dzung. The Trustees and Staff of China Institute wish to express their deepest condolences to Wango Weng on the passing of his beloved wife Virginia, and to their children Dr. Ssu Isabel Weng and I-Hsueh Hugo Weng. As an accomplished writer and author in her own right, Virginia was an invaluable partner to her husband in many educational and cultural areas, including China Institute, where her husband served as a distinguished volunteer President for five years. Our thoughts and prayers go out to Wan-go and his family at this time.
