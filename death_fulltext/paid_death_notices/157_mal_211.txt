        ISSELBACHER-Alfred. An amusing and stimulating conversationalist, keen on life and ever ready to defend his views, even as a septagenarian. He never complained and kept going, as best he could, until the end, even though circumstances became hard. He was a remarkable and attractive man and all who knew him were privileged.
