        KAESS--Kenneth R. It was our great good fortune to know Ken Kaess as a friend and colleague over the past 16 years. Ken was so much more than a business partner and confidant, he was a remarkably caring human being who graciously put the needs and concerns of others before his own. In so many ways, he taught us how to live life to the fullest, to take joy in the accomplishments of others, to face the challenges of work and life with an indomitable spirit, and to look even the toughest problem straight in the eye and face it with courage and confidence. His spirit inspired us to the end. We will sorely miss him and fondly remember the joy he brought to our lives. Keith, Rose-Lee, Geoff, Rachel and Lizzie Reinhard
