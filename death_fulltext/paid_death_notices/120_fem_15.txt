        CLARK, Mona (nee Christie). 24 March 1921-28 December 1996. Mona will be remembered with love, fondness and admiration by all who knew her. Devoted mother of her sons Christie and Russell. She was a Peace Crops volunteer in 1970-1972, which is just one example of a source of warmth and pride for us.
