        PORDY--Leon, M.D. It is with profound sorrow that The Mount Sinai Alumni mourns the passing of our dear friend and colleague. Devoted to his patients whom he cared for with expertise and compassion and a conscientious mentor who touch the lives of countless students and residents, he was respected by his peers and loved by his patients. In 2000, The Mount Sinai Alumni presented its coveted Special Recognition Award to Dr. Pordy acknowledging over 50 years of dedication to Mount Sinai, his significant contributions in the field of cardiology, and his role in the establishment of the Page & William Black Postgraduate School of Medicine. A compassionate human being and a gentle man, he leaves a legacy of devotion to the art and science of medicine and an example of scholarship for generations to come. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his family. William G. Stein, M.D.--Pres. Barry D. Stimmel, M.D.--V.P. Elliot Rayfield, M.D.--Sec'y Betty Mintz, M.D.--Treas.
