        LABINGER-Marvin, Rabbi. We mourn with profound sorrow the passing of our beloved colleague. He served for thirty years as a career chaplain in the United States Air Force and retired with the rank of colonel in 1990 when he assumed the position of Executive Director of the Pacific Southwest region of the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism until his retirement in 2000. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife Joette, children Gila Freeberg and Zev and to all who were touched through his rabbinate. Rabbi Reuven Hammer, Pres. Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Exec. V.P. Rabbinical Assembly
