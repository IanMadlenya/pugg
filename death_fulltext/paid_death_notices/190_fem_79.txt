        MURASHKOVSKY - Stacy. The Touro College family is profoundly saddened by the untimely demise of Stacy Murashkovsky, a brilliant student of our College for Women and an honors graduate of Moscow University/Touro, our branch campus in Russia. Stacy was the beautiful and loving child of our colleagues, Drs. Roman and Renee Murashkovsky. We all deeply mourn this human tragedy, the loss of a gifted child of extraordinary precocity. She will be missed by us all. Touro will establish a memorial award to honor her memory. Dr. Bernard Lander, President Touro College Mark Hasten, Chairman Board of Trustees Devorah Ehrlich, Dean Women's Division
