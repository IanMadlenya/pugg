        ROTHMAN--Anita. The Yeshiva University family is deeply grieved by the passing of a devoted past National President of the Yeshiva University Women's Organization, who was deeply dedicated to YU. The beloved wife of Jerry J. Rothman, she was highly intelligent and competent. Her loyalty to YUWO, Yeshiva University, and RIETS followed in her family's tradition of stalwart support for YU and RIETS students. Heartfelt condolences are extended to Jerry, to their children Dr. Steven (and Roz) Rothman, Dr. Howard (and Brenda) Rothman, and Dr. Nathan (and Joan) Rothman; to her sister, Leah Miller, and to her grandchildren and great grandchildren. May the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dinah Pinczower National Chairman YUWO
