        GETTINGER -- Milton M., M.D. Yesterday would have been the 36th birthday of our son and brother, whose warm presence is always with us. His memory will be enshrined in a new research library at Lenox Hill Hospital, where he was on the staff, to be known as the Milton Gettinger, M.D. Study Center. We hope that present and future doctors will use its facilities for their studies and research. The Gettinger Family
