        DIBBELL--Helen Hope. On May 3, 2004. Born in Chelsea, MA on January 21, 1908. Devoted wife of the late Charles Dibbell, loyal sister of Quentin Hope and the late Henry Hope, Harvey Cecil Hope, and Florence Messing, beloved mother of Sandy Dibbell-Hope, Joy Harvey, Carola Dibbell and Adam Dibbell, remembered fondly by nine adoring grandchildren, four fascinated great-grandchildren, and almost everyone else who ever met her. Hope graduated from Barnard College in 1928, did graduate work at the University of London and Yale University, and proceeded to use her gifts to nurture and entertain her family and friends. She died as she lived, keenly interested in the world around her and deeply concerned for the well being of others.
