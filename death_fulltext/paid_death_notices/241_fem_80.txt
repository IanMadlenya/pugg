        KRAMAN--Esther (nee Weinstock) of New York died on January 29th after an illness. She was 84 years old. As a young bride coming to America from wartime Belgium where she survived the second World War in hiding, she worked on a variety of projects to ensure equality in her new country, including the initial implementation of the Princeton Plan in Queens, NY, a program to give all public school children access to quality, integrated education. She later worked as a School Volunteer helping new immigrants to learn English. Her great intellectual passion was the study of the works of Marcel Proust, and she helped found the Proust Society of America at the Mercantile Library. Cherishing her past and hopeful for the future, she was a docent at the Center for Jewish History in NY. Beloved wife of the late Eli, survived by her daughters Nadine and Cynthia.
