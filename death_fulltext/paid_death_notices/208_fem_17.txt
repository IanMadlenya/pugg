        BROWN--Jane E. The North Shore-Long Island Jewish (LIJ) Health System mourns the passing of Jane E. Brown, a devoted supporter of North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset who inspired her husband, Dayton Brown Sr. to become a member of the Board of Trustees, where he served with distinction until his death in 1978. Mrs. Brown was an associate trustee and her son, Dayton T. Brown Jr., is a current member of the North Shore-LIJ Health System Board of Trustees. Mrs. Brown was the first volunteer at North Shore Hospital when it opened in 1953. She served in the Auxiliary for over 35 years. Through the generosity of Jane and Dayton Brown Jr., The Jane and Dayton Brown Sr. Laboratory for Viral Diseases was founded at the hospital, specifically to advance our knowledge of and programs for AIDS. In addition, Mrs. Brown and her son established the endowment for the Jane and Dayton T. Brown Professorship in Medicine (Infectious Disease) at North Shore University Hospital. We extend our deepest sympathies to Mrs. Brown's family. She will be greatly missed. Roy J. Zuckerberg, Chairman Michael Dowling President & CEO North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System
