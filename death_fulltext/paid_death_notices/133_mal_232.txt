        Rabbi Abraham P. The members of the Brooklyn Jewish Center and the community mourn the passing of our beloved Rabbi who was our leader and teacher for many years. Rabbi Bloch, an alummus of Yeshiva Yitzchak Elchanan, had also previously been the Rabbi of Congregation Petach Tikvah for almost the entire existance of that synagogue. Rabbi Bloch had the scholarship, dedication and gifts to transmit and infuse the spirit, the meaning and the essence of every facet of Judaism to the extent that we all eagerly looked forward to every service he conducted and every class that he taught. Rabbi Bloch was also the author of numerous books on Jewish subjects. He will be sorely missed by all who knew him. May his family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
