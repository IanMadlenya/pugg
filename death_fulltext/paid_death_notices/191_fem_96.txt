        deVEGVAR-Erna Neuman. Cotswold Neighborhood Association, Scarsdale, N.Y., directors, note with great sorrow the sudden passing of its indefatigable Vice President and de facto ''mayor'' of Cotswold, Erna Neuman deVegvar. Her vigor and tireless community energy remain an inspiration to us all.
