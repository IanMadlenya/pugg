        ELLERTSON -- Charlotte, Ph.D. March 22, 2004, breast cancer. The Members, Counsel, associates, paralegals and staff of Fragomen, Del Rey, Bernsen & Loewy deeply mourn the untimely passing of Dr. Charlotte Ellertson, wife of our colleague and Member, Paull Hejinian. Dr. Ellertson, although only 38, was an internationally recognized expert and spokesperson in the field of women's reproductive rights. She worked for Population Council for a number of years, traveling worldwide, leading research efforts and developing health programs. Most recently, Dr. Ellertson founded Ibis Reproductive Health, an international women's reproductive rights, research and advocacy group headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She wrote widely in the field and contributed to numerous publications. Dr. Ellertson led an extraordinarily accomplished life in a tragically short period of time. It was simply impossible to meet Charlotte and not be deeply impressed. Our entire firm extends its heartfelt condolences to Paull, daughters Marka (4) and Amy (2) and all of the family. Fragomen, Del Rey, Bernsen & Loewy, P.C.
