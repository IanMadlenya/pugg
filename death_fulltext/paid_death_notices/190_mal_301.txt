        PLEVIN-Murry. Age 93, passed away on Sunday, November 24, 2002 from natural causes. He is survived by daughters Marcia Spier of Hollywood, Fla. and Susan Abbate of Boca Raton, Fla. He graduated New York University intending to become a lawyer, but because of the Great Depression, he had to change careers. One of his early jobs was with a collection agency. He treated everyone with respect and dignity, even if they could only afford to give him 50 cents towards debts. Later on, he became one of the top manufacturers' representatives for several well known childrenswear and furniture companies. He thoughtfully taught himself Spanish to help him communicate better with his Cuban customers in Miami. He was happily married to Mollie Schwatzman for 57 years before she passed away in 1990. Susan Abbate will be sitting shiva at her home in Boca Raton starting Wednesday November 26 for one week. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made to the American Heart Association or the American Cancer Society. This gentle and loving soul will be missed by all.
