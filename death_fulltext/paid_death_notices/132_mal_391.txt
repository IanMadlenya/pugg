        NEU-Harold C., M.D. The members of the New York Society of Infectious Diseases mark, with deep sadness, the death of Harold C. Neu, M.D., the first President of our Society. Dr. Neu was a most esteemed colleague and friend, who distinguished himself as a physician, educator and scientist. For these reasons, our annual scientific meeting is named ''The Harold C. Neu Symposium'' in his honor and memory. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his wife Carmen Ortiz-Neu, M.D. and children Harold A. Neu, Maria Neu Rorer, Natalie Neu, M.D. and his granddaughter Katherine Rorer.
