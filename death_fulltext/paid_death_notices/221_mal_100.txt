        LEWIS--Raymond E. The International Fine Print Dealers Association (IFPDA) notes with profound sadness, the passing of Emeritus Member, Raymond E. Lewis. His San Francisco gallery, R.E. Lewis, Inc., founded in 1952, offered a wide range of fine prints to American museums and collectors from German Expressionist to ukiyo-e Japanese woodblocks. A renowned scholar, his early detailed catalogues became models for dealers and auction houses worldwide. His knowledge, integrity and wonderful sense of humor will be greatly missed by his many friends and colleagues at the IFPDA.
