        ASHWORTH-Eric C., 39, died on Sunday, July 20 at his home in NY City. He grew up in Bronxville, NY and attended Tufts University and University of California at Berkeley. As partner at literary agency Donadio & Ashworth, he became known for his extraordinary ability to discover and nurture exciting new voices in American fiction. His courage, resilience, thoughtfulness, and good humor will always be an inspiration and he will be sorely missed. He is survived by his parents, Richard and Amy Ashworth of N.Y. City and his brother and sister-in-law Everard and Brooke Ashworth of Ventura, CA. In lieu of flowers, send all donations in memory of Eric Ashworth to God's Love We Deliver.
