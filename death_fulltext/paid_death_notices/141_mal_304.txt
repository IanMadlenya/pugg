        TEITEL-Nathan. Age 88. On October 25, 1998; husband of the late beloved Carol, actress. He had won distinction in every literary genre: poetry, drama and fiction. His book of poems, ''In Time of Tide'', was noted by fellow poet, William Packard, as ''terse, impassioned and utterly lyrical-something that is rare in any day and age....The severe spirits of Catullus and Herman Melville hover over these lines, ominously plain and stark and heroic.'' Mr. Packard's Appreciation ''Catullus: Roaming over many lands and waters/I come, my brother,/to give you these last rites of death/and speak to your mute dust./Atque in perpetuum/frater, ave atque vale. Service Thursday, 11AM, at ''The Riverside'', 76th St and Amsterdam Avenue.
