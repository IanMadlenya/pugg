        ZIRINSKY-Barbara. On 13 August, 1999. The Members of the Board and Staff of Gracie Square Hospital mourn the loss of the daughter of our Hospital's Founders, Cynthia and Richard Zirinsky. Barbara was the loving mother of Cynthia Deutsch Ekes, and the devoted sister of Susan Peyronin and Richard Zirinsky, Jr. We remember her for the directness, honesty, and concern she showed for her patients in her position as a Department Head of the Hospital and for her inspired teaching and creative leadership for three generations of students. Her gallant and courageous behavior has provided us an enviable model and has touched the lives of all of us who knew her. We extend our heartfelt condolences to her grieving family and many friends.
