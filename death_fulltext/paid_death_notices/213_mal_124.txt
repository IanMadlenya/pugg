        ROSS--Raymond. On the evening of August 24, the photographer Raymond Ross, age 81, died in his home on Houston Street in Manhattan. The cause of death was complications from diabetes and asthma. For nearly 60 years, Ray Ross was a wellknown and widely admired figure in the New York downtown music scene. His intimate photographs document the flowering of Jazz, as he was one of the few to chronicle the transition from the big band sound of Duke Ellington to the Bebop era ushered in by John Coltrane and Miles Davis. His lifelong involvement with the downtown community kept him engaged with the avantgarde music and dance world he loved so dearly. He leaves behind over 20,000 photographs and a large community of artists, musicians and friends who know that Ray's adventurous spirit lives on in their own work. Born in New York City on February 10, 1924, Ray is survived by his friend and companion for many years Ellen Christi. His nephews David A. Ross of New York City, Mark R. Ross of Los Angeles, and Robert B. Ross of San Francisco will remember Ray as a man committed to his passion for music and photography. A memorial celebration for Ray will be held at St. Peter's at Lexington and 54th Street at 7 PM on Sunday, November 21.
