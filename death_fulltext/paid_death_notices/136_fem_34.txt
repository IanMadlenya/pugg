        GELMAN-Natasha. The trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn the passing of Natasha Gelman, passionate collector and generous donor who bequeathed as the legacy of herself and her late husband Jacques an unparalleled collection of 20thcentury European masterworks. She graciously established an endowned curatorship of 20th-century art. She will be remembered at the Metropolitan Museum for her many important contributions-as honorary trustee, benefactor, donor, advisor, lender-as well as for her remarkable eye, generosity of spirit, her ebullience and wit and her joy in sharing with the public such an extraordinary collection.
