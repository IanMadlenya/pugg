        TOTTENHAM-Dinah. The Directors of the Parkinson's Disease Foundation mourn the death of their former executive director, a woman of great integrity, industry, compassion and grace. Under her leadership of eighteen years, the Foundation became transformed into a major force in the quest for the cause and cure of Parkinson's disease. This Board, and the entire Parkinson's community, have lost a champion, a conscience and a friend. Lewis P. Rowland, MD, President
