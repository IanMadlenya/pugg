        MEYER-Sandra W. The Metropolitan Opera mourns with profound sadness the passing of Sandra W. Meyer, a devoted member of our Association for 15 years, including service as a Director of our Managing Board since 1986. We are deeply grateful for her dedicated commitment to the Metropolitan Opera. Her creative leadership of the Metropolitan Opera/Metropolitan Opera Guild Membership Committee for more than a decade inspired the expansion of our programs to build audiences for the Met and to stimulate broad nationwide support for our activities. Her courageous and energetic participation in our affairs when faced with the challenges of serious illness set an example of public service that will be remembered by all of us who worked with her and were privileged to know her as a friend and colleague. We extend our deepest condolences to her family. The Metropolitan Opera Association
