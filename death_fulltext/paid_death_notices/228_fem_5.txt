        MILLER--Joan Callner. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) mourn the loss of Joan Callner Miller of Chicago and Palm Beach, an unflagging supporter of our organization, of the Technion and of Israel for many decades. She was a member of the national Board of Directors and served on the Chicago Chapter Board of Directors and as past acting president of the Palm Beach Chapter. She was also a founding officer of the organization's Southern Region and an honorary life member of the Technion International Board of Governors. The many projects Mrs. Callner Miller supported included the Joan Callner Miller Chair in Computer Science, the Callner Family Auditorium, and the Chicago Chapter Organic Chemistry Laboratory. Mrs. Callner Miller's dedication was recognized with an honorary fellowship from the Technion in 1984. We extend our sincere condolences to her children, Michael Miller and Debbie Monroe, her grandchildren, and the entire Miller family.
