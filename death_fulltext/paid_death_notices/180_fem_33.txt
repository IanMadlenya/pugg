        RUBINSTEIN-Aniela (Nela). Died peacefully at her home in NY on December 31. Age 93. Our beloved mother will be missed by all of us; her children, Eva, Paul, Alina and John Rubinstein, her grandchildren Amy and David (and Kristy) Coffin, Jason (and Amy), Jessica, Michael, Peter and Jacob Rubinstein, and her great grandchildren, Alexander and Julian Coffin-Lennear and Linnea Coffin. She was born in Vilnius, Lithuania, the youngest daughter of Emil Mlynarski, the founder in 1901 and first Conductor of the Warsaw Philharmonic, and later Director of the Warsaw Opera for 20 years. In her youth, she studied dance in Dresden with Mary Wigman. She was briefly married to Mieczyslaw Munz, a pianist who later taught at Juilliard. Her 50 year marriage to Arthur Rubinstein lasted until his death in 1982. They lived in Paris until the outbreak of WW II, when they were forced to leave, later joining the emigre artistic community in Hollywood. They became US citizens in 1946. After 1954 they reclaimed their house in Paris, and also maintained homes in New York and Spain. Our mother was known for her wonderful cooking, her memorable parties, her great charm, her elegance and beauty. She spoke seven languages, was immensely musical, sculpted, painted, and even embroidered with talent. She played a major role in making the annual Polonaise Ball a highly successful event for the benefit of Polish Assistance, Inc. In 1983, Alfred A. Knopf published ''Nela's Cookbook,'' to the delight of her family and friends. It was later translated into Polish. We loved our sweet Ma, and we will deeply miss her spontaneity, her enthusiasm, her generosity, and her quirky humor. A celebration of her life will be planned for a later date.
