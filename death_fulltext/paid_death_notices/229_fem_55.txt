        BENJAMIN--Miriam. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) are deeply saddened by the loss of Miriam Benjamin of Sarasota, Florida. Mrs. Benjamin was a founder of our Sarasota/Gulf Coast Chapter and prior to moving to Florida, was a National Vice President of the ATS Women's Division. She was a Life Trustee of the ATS Board of Regents and an Honorary Life Member of the Technion International Board of Governors. Mrs. Benjamin and her late husband Louis were both Technion Guardians, demonstrating the highest level of commitment to Israel and the Technion. The Louis and Miriam Benjamin Chair in Computers and Communication Networks, The Louis and Miriam Benjamin Signal Processing Laboratory and The Louis and Miriam Benjamin/Sarasota Chapter Auditorium are but a part of the Benjamins' legacy that will help generations of students become Israel's leaders in the high-tech fields that are the foundation of Israel's future. Revered as unequaled in their outstanding generosity and steadfast dedication to the Technion, Miriam and Louis were both awarded Technion Honorary Fellowships as well as Honorary Doctorates. They are the only couple in the Technion's history to be so recognized. Our hearts go out to Mrs. Benjamin's daughter, Carol B. Epstein, ATS Washington, D.C. Chapter president, and the entire Benjamin family. Stephen A. Laser, President Evelyn Berger, Chairman, Board of Directors Melvyn H. Bloom, Executive Vice President Gary G. Folz, President, Sarasota/Gulf Coast Chapter Betty Lustig, Director Southern Region
