        JACOBSON-S. Hirsch. We mourn the passing on Shabbat, September 27, of our beloved former principal and master teacher. He led our school with vision and commitment and helped to create an outstanding Conservative Jewish Day School. We extend our deepest sympathy to his devoted wife Marion, to his beloved daughters, Shira, Atara, Roni and Adina, to his sister Sylvia Antelman and his brother Shai. Burial and Shiva are taking place in Israel. May his memory be for a blessing. Solomon Schechter Day School of Essex and Union Neil B. Goldstein, President Dr. Elaine R.S. Cohen, Head
