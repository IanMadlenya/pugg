        BUTTONS--Red. The Officers, Governors and Members of the Friars Club mourn the loss of their beloved and esteemed member Friar Red Buttons. Red, the Friars Scribe Emeritus, was a comedy genius whose gift of laughter was unparalleled. His mastery of wit endeared him to Friars during roasts and dinners garnering laughs and respect among his peers in entertainment. Red Buttons may have claimed to never have had a dinner but his plate was filled with admiration and adoration from his fellow Friars. He will be missed but his legacy of laughter will live on in our hearts. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his family. Jerry Lewis, Abbot Freddie Roman, Dean Jean Pierre Trebot, Exec. Dir.
