        ASHMAWY-Seif. The Board of Directors and staff of the Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious Understanding note, with sorrow, the passing of our cherished Advisory Board member, Seif Ashmawy. Seif, an Egyptian immigrant who came to the U.S. in pursuit of freedom, was a constant, vocal and courageous force for understanding and reconciliation betweeen Muslims and those of other faiths. Our hearts go out to his wife Maria and his son Omar, who we know will continue in his footsteps. Georgette Bennett, Ph.D. President
