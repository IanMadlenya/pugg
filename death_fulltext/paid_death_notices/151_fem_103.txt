        WHITE-Barbara. It is with joy and sadness that the Founders, Trustees, Staff and Artists of the Vermont Studio Center acknowledge the passing of our friend, fellow artist, colleague and benefactor, Barbara White...Joy at having known her and sadness for not being able to know her longer. As a painter and philanthropist, Barbara has been and will continue to be an inspiration to all of us who had the good fortune to know and work with her. Her legacy will also reside in the future generations of artists and writers at the studio center who will benefit from her great generosity through Artists' Fellowships and the creation of two studio buildings, the Barbara White Painting Studios and the Elias Schultz Sculpture Studios (honoring her uncle Eli). Barbara's intelligent, grounded compassion coupled with her clear common sense backed by an unusual sense of personal philanthropic responsibility made her a special friend we will always honor. Her guidance as a long-time VSC Trustee and Board Chair from 1996-1999, her strength of spirit, her strong, colorful paintings and her abiding faith in art and community will be missed by every one of us. We extend our gratitude to Barbara and our hearts to her entire family. Jon Gregg, Louise von Weise VSC Founders Wolf Kahn, Emily Mason VSC Honorary Founders Nadine Goldsmith VSC Board Chair
