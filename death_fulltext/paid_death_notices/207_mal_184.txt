        HERSKOVITS -- Rabbi Shi mon. It is with great sorrow that we mourn the untimely passing of a wonderful man who dedicated his whole life to teaching children. He touched all he met with his true kindness. May his memory be a blessing to his family and an inspiration to his students. He will be greatly missed at the Magen David Yeshiva, Isaac Shalom Elementary School. Moe Maleh
