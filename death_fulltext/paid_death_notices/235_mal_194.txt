        PRIOR--Rev. Francis. The St. John's University Board of Trustees notes, with profound sorrow, the passing of Rev. Francis Prior, C.M., who dedicated himself to God and to the Vincentian community in a priesthood that spanned more than fifty years. He served St. John's University as a member of its Board of Trustees for almost a decade. He touched all who he knew by his wisdom, gentleness and kindness and enriched us with his great gifts and his extraordinary faith. Our prayers are with his family and his Vincentain confreres.
