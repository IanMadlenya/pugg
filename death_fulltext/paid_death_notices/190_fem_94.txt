        ADLER-Rhoda. The entire Hebrew Academy of the Five Towns and Rockaway community is deeply saddened by the passing of Rhoda Adler, beloved wife of the late Dr. Donald Adler. Together, the Adlers were distinguished founders of the Hillel School, one of HAFTR's predecessor yeshivot. We extend our deepest sympathy to her children, Alisa, Gary, Richard and Stuart Adler and to the entire Adler family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Israel.
