        TEITELBAUM -- William. Wonderful husband to the late Beatrice. Dear and special father to Linda and Marc. Loving and devoted grandfather, brother, son, uncle and friend. Compassionate and charitable, he had profound empathy for his fellow man. We will miss him immeasurably, not the least for his side-splitting family stories and rich baritone renditions of ''Happy Birthday.'' So full of life. He would sacrifice anything for his family. Bea and Bill are together again. Graveside service Wednesday, February 23 at 11 AM, New Montefiore Cemetery, Farmingdale, NY.
