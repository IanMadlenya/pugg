        BRUMBERG-Pamela. DOROT mourns the loss of a visionary friend who, through the Littauer Foundation, helped create the Judaic studies division of our University Without Walls program for homebound seniors and enabled us to establish the DOROT Fellowship Program in service of the elderly. Her wise counsel and dedication will be sorely missed. May her family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Joel D. Kazis, President Vivian Fenster Ehrlich, Executive Director
