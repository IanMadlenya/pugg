        KLAR--Henry. The Meltzer family deeply regrets the passing of a dear friend. Our heartfelt sympathies are extended to his wife Gloria, his sons Steven, Ronald and Lester, as well as the rest of his family. He was a wonderful and loving husband and father. A man of great distinction and integrity who left his mark and who was always sensitive to the needs of others. He was a very special friend who will be missed and never forgotten.
