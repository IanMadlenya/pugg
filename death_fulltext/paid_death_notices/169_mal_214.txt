        SHEA-Robert Smith. Colonel and Reverend. Died February 15, 2001 in his 79th year in New York, New York. The New York Society of Military and Naval Officers wishes to express its deepest sympathy for the loss of our Chaplain, Colonel Robert S. Shea, who served far and above the call of duty not only for the members of our Society, but for the soldiers, airmen, sailors and veterans with whom he came in contact both while on active service and in his retirement. Colonel Shea received his B.A. from St Bonaventure University in 1943, his Master's in Education from St. Bonaventure University in 1948, his M.A. from Tulane University in 1949, and his Doctorate in Education from Columbia University in 1967. In civilian life, he served as Dean of Marymount College in N.Y.C. His career in the U.S. Air Force earned him the Joint Services Commendation Medal, the U.S. Air Force Commendation Medal, the U.S. Air Force Reserve Medal, the World War II Victory Medal, the New York State Medal of Military Commendation, and numerous other federal and state military medals and awards. Those of us in the Society will miss his dedication and personal warmth as a Chaplain and as a dear friend. May he rest in peace. Viewing will be at Church of the Guardian Angels, 10th Ave between 22nd and 23 St, Manhattan on Tuesday, February 20, from 12:30-1:30 PM. The mass will be held at 1:30.
