Loving mother to Barbara Lucas and Marcia Kessler and their husbands Richard Nesson and Eric Kessler. Dear sister to Helen. Adoring grandmother to Rachel, Mara, Jason and Brandon, and great grandmother to Zoe, Max and Gabriel. Her love and passion, her wisdom and devotion to family and friends, and her strength and integrity will remain in our hearts forever.
