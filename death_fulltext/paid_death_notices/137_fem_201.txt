        LIPMAN-Jean. The Board of Trustees and professional staff of the Museum of American Folk Art record with profound sorrow the death of their esteemed friend and colleague, Jean Lipman, who served with distinction as a Trustee of the Museum during its formative years and provided wise and discerning counsel as Trustee Emerita for more than twenty years. One of the last of the pioneering collector-scholars who gave shape to the emerging field of American folk art at mid-century, she helped establish its importance to American life and culture through her many published essays and books. With her late husband, Howard, she was a major donor to the Museum's permanent collection and will be remembered by us with gratitude and affection for her principled commitment to excellence, the generosity of her spirit and the warmth of her encouragement. To Peter and Beverly Lipman and the rest of Jean Lipman's family goes this sincere expression of our deepest sympathy. Ralph O. Esmerian, President, Board of Trustees Gerard C. Wertkin, Director
        LIPMAN-Jean. The Board of Trustees and staff at the Whitney Museum of American Art note with great sadness the passing of Jean Lipman, a longtime friend and beloved patron of the Whitney. From her pioneering efforts to establish the Whitney's significant collection of 20th-century sculpture with her late husband, Howard, to her scholarly contributions to many of the Museum's publications, and exhibitions Jean's insightful dedication has had a lasting effect on the furtherance of the Whitney's mission. She will be warmly remembered for her steadfast support of American art and artists. We extend our heartfelt condolences to her son Peter, his wife Beverly and their children, Benjamin and Timothy. Flora M. Biddle, Hon. Chairman Leonard A. Lauder, Chairman Joel S. Ehrenkranz, Pres. Willard Holmes, Acting Dir.
