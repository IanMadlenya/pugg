        PIERSON--Polly Stokes, a wonderful mother and grandmother, died peacefully at her home in Malibu on April 5, surrounded by her family. She was born to Walter and Polly Stokes in Manhattan in 1926. After attending the Chapin School, she pursued a BA, Class of '48, and Master's degree at Radcliffe. A summer resident of Cooperstown, she met Frank Romer Pierson there and they later married and moved to California in the early '50's. A generous supporter of the performing arts, Polly was a major contributor to the Glimmerglass Opera from its inception. Her son Michael and his wife Maggie, their children Colin, Emmet and Gracie and her daughter Eve and children Hannah and Ben, wish to thank the many friends for the love and concern they have always shown.
