        DASH--Samuel (1925-2004). The International League for Human Rights honors Mr. Samuel Dash, our beloved compatriot, fellow human rights advocate and member of our Governing Council. Mr. Dash valiantly fought for human rights throughout the world. His contributions to the construction of civil society in the United States, South Africa, Northern Ireland and Chile were immense. Mr. Dash was a cherished friend of the International League for three decades. His work represents the most golden moments in the League's history. His triumphant commitment to the pursuit of justice and the preservation of human dignity will remain a lasting legacy, never to be forgotten. He will be dearly missed by all. The International League for Human Rights wishes to extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Sara Dash, and daughters, Judi and Rachel Dash.
