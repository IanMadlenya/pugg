        BARLOW--Frederick R. Beloved husband of Anita, father of Douglas, Jennifer and Matthew, father-in-law of Thomas Amodio, grandfather of Jessica, Jonathan, Tyler and Madison. Born in the Bronx, September 9, 1929, Fred grew up with the ''gang'' (Bernie, Sol, Sonny and Sye). He attended Tulane University earning a degree in chemical engineering. He then volunteered and became a Lieutenant for the U.S. Army serving in Korea and Europe. Upon his return to NYC, he met the love of his life, Anita. He worked for the Plastics Division of Celanese Corporation, Plastic Materials in Hicksville and then formed his own company in 1967, Polymer Materials Incorporated, headquartered in Farmingdale. By not being afraid to hire young people and getting them started in their careers, PMI ultimately grew to over 2000 employees with facilities in Chicago, Rhode Island, Atlanta and Newark. PMI was listed on the NYSE until he arranged the sale to Georgia Pacific in 1981. He retired shortly thereafter and lived primarily in Palm Beach Gardens enjoying his life of golf, the stock market, dear friends and family. He was everyone's ''go to'' guy, offering sound advice, encouragement, help and love to anyone who asked. Services will be held at Gutterman's Funeral Home, in Woodbury, LI, at 2 PM, on Monday, April 3rd. The family is requesting that donations be sent to Memorial Sloan-Kettering in NYC.
