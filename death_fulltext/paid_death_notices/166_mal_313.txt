        HERMELIN-David B. Thanks To Scandinavia notes with sadness the untimely passing of David B. Hermelin, dynamic U.S. Ambassador to Norway and passionate philanthropic leader. Ambassador Hermelin honored our educational foundation in 1998 with the establishment of the annual David B. Hermelin Thanks To Scandinavia Scholarship at the University of Michigan. We will be forever grateful for his friendship and his vigorous support of the moral imperatives of Thanks To Scandinavia in perpetuating appreciation for the bravery of the people, governments and churches of Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden in rescuing thousands of persons of the Jewish faith from the Holocaust. Victor Borge, National Chairman Richard Netter, President
