        MOSKOWITZ--Sunny. The Abraham Joshua Heschel School community mourns the passing of Sunny Moskowitz, beloved wife of the late Herbert Moskowitz, adored mother of Roanna Shorofsky, our esteemed Head of School, and of Miriam Ben-Natan. Sunny was the mother-in-law of Morris and Rafi, beloved grandmother of Karren, Sharon and Keren, cherished greatgrandmother of Rebecca, Julia, Jonathan, Noa and Maya. Sunny's good deeds, dignity and grace is clearly mirrored in her daughter Roanna, whose leadership and dedication over the last fifteen years has lead to our school's growth and flourishing. Under her superb guidance the School has grown to over 700 students, has established a high school division, developed a reputation for academic excellence and instilled a love for Judaism and Israel in its graduates. Of this her mother was justifiably proud. Our community is elevated by Roanna and Morris' outstanding example of honoring one's parent. May the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Board of Trustees Alisa R. Doctoroff, President
