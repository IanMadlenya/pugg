        BERNSTEIN-Zalman. It is with great sorrow that the Board of Directors and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Zalman Bernstein, one of the most significant philanthropists of this generation. His philanthropic endeavors, through the AVI CHAI Foundation and the Sanford C. Bernstein & Company Foundation, have greatly enriched Jewish life in New York, Israel, and around the world. By showing the foresight to support projects which bring Jews from different backgrounds together, he has left a legacy that will benefit thousands of individuals in immeasurable ways well into the 21st century. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Mem, his children, Leslie, Claude, and Rochel Leah, and to the entire Bernstein family. May his memory be a blessing to us all.
