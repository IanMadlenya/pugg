        CARSWELL -- Donald. The Board of Trustees, Staff and Auxiliary of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden mourn the loss of our dear friend and former Trustee Donald Carswell. During his 10 year tenure on the board, Donald served as a trustee and as vice chairman with good humor and unfailing commitment, using his fine intellect to further the mission of the Garden. He will be sorely missed by the Garden and the entire Brooklyn community. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Lois, chairman emeritus of the Garden, and to his entire family. Earl D. Weiner, Board Chairman Judith D. Zuk, President Katherine Doran, Auxiliary President
