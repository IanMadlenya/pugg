        WILKINS--Dr. Arthur H., died March 14, in Manhattan at age 88. He graduated from Columbia Grammar, Yale University, and received his Ph.D in Sociology from University of Chicago. After teaching at Brown, Dr. Wilkins became Director of Market Research at Papert Koenig Lois and Grey Advertising. He was an erudite person with varied interests and an engaging sense of humor. One of his great passions was jazz. In lively conversations, he was as likely to quote from the Great American Songbook as from Shakespeare. He is survived by his wife of 37 years, Patricia, and their daughter Sarah; his first wife Kathleen and two of their children, Thomas, and Patricia Parker; six grandchildren and a great-grandson; and his sister Shirley Liebowitz. His eldest son John died in 2003. Donations may be made in his name to Arts for Art, 107 Suffolk St. NY, NY 10002
