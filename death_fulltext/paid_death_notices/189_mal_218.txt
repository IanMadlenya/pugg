        CARLIN-Frank. On October 16, 2002, when, after a long struggle, his heart sadly became as weak as it was tremendous. He lived into his 91st year, always with abundant personality and never without as much love for his family as there can be. Beloved father of Gail Benderand Allan Carlin, father-inlaw of Sheldon Bender and Diane Carlin, grandfather of Seth and Michael Bender and Rebecca and Emily Carlin.
