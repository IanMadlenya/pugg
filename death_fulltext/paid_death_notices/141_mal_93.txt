        HARRIS-Robert Knight. The Board of Directors and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Robert Knight Harris, devoted husband, father and grandfather. Our sympathies are extended to his wife, Myrna, and his children, Betty Ann; Walter and his wife, Gail; Michelle; Caren and her husband, Peter; and his grandchildren, Kate and Jenny. Mr. Harris was a loyal supporter of UJA-Federation as a past chairman of the General Insurance Division. His son, Walter, currently serves on the General Insurance Committee. Our most sincere sympathies are with his entire family and we know that his presence will be missed by many. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair James S. Tisch, President Stephen D.
