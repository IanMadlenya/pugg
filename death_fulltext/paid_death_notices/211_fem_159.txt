        APPELBAUM -- Barbara. What can I say about the most incredible woman I've ever known. She was my sister-in-law for 22 years. Always battling ALS, she displayed dignity and courage that knew no bounds. She was always there for me and everybody. I really learned a lot about how to value life from Barbara and her late husband Ben. My love and condolences to her son Joe and my darling wife Joan. You will never be forgotten. Bobby Rosen
