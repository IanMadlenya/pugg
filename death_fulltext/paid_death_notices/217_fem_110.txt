        KRAKER--Dr. Barbara, Ph.D. On January 30, 2005. Born in the Bronx in 1939, she received her B.A. in Psychology at City College, her M.A. at Columbia University and her Ph.D. at New York University. Moved to Port Washington with her husband David Kraker, where, through word of mouth, she built a thriving clinical practice. Dr. Kraker was a brilliant, creative Psychologist whose informal style and biting sense of humor earned her a devout following among her clients, many of whom traveled great distances to conduct their sessions with her in the hospital during her long illness. A keeper of professional confidences, the extent of good work she did will never fully be known, except by those whose lives she touched. She will be missed more than words can say by her son Daniel, her daughter Susan, and friends and clients whose lives she transformed. A private service for family and friends was held on February 5, but condolences can be sent to Daniel at ostapledon@ yahoo.com and Susan at piware@pacbell.net
