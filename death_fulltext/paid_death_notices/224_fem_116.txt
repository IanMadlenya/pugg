        ALEXANDER--''Georgie'' With deepest sorrow we announce the loss of our beloved Georgie on August 29, born September 18, 1918. Daughter of John and Sadye Gelernter. A true New Yorker, her life was filled with love of the arts which she inspired in everyone whose life she touched. Graduate of Newark State Teachers College, she began teaching art at Russell Sage JHS and went on to produce and broadcast art programs at Ch-13 and NYCE. She brought artists into the public schools as creator/co-founder of ''Studio in a School,'' retiring in 1986 as Director of Art for NYC schools. Georgie will be remembered by her nieces and nephews and all who knew her for her warmth, generosity and youthful spirit. Survived by her devoted daughter, Jane Alexander-Perry and loving sister, Jacqueline Levinson. A memorial will be held at 3 PM, September 25, at Riverside Chapel, 180 West 76th Street, NYC
