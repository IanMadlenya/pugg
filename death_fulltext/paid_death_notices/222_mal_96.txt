        HERTZBERG--Bob. 92, newspaperman. Husband of the late Claire Hertzberg, father of Michael, Papa of Julie and David. He quit high school to work for the ''Daily Mirror'' as a copy boy, reporter, and News Editor until the paper's demise in 1963. He then was a Features Editor with the ''Daily News.'' He made reporters look better, and, better still, made everyone he came in contact with laugh. A graveside service will be held at 1 PM, Monday, July 11, 2005 at Beth David Cemetery.
