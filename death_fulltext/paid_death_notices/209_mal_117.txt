        WALSH--Bernard. 91, a hero of D-Day, three times decorated, died on its 60th anniversary. He was a sculptor of great sensitivity and eloquence. He was also an innovator of framing designs who pioneered in conservation techniques. He is survived by Annie, his wife of 68 years, his daughter-in-law Susan and grandchildren Samuel and Leah. Requiescat in pace, dearest Bern.
