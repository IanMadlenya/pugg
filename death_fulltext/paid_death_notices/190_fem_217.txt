        KAUFMAN-Muriel D. On November 27, 2002. Devoted daughter of the late Herman and Betty Berkson. Sister of the late Irving Berkson. Beloved wife of Joseph. Cherished mother of Lucas and Abigail. Beloved mother-inlaw of Lisa Bachar Kaufman. Adored grandmother of Bailey. A graduate of the University of Wisconsin, she embarked on a successful acting career that included Broadway, stage and television after studying with Stella Adler. Yet this burgeoning career gave way to her myriad other interests and creativity. Fire Island became her second beloved home where she luxuriated in the bucolic lifestyle of homemaker, gardener, collector of antiques and superb hostess. She will be sorely missed by all whose life she touched. Visiting hours 7-9 P.M. Sunday, funeral service on Monday 11:15 at ''The Riverside'', 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue.
