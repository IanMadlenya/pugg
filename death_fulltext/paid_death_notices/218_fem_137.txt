        ADAMS--Ruth. The board and staff of the Trust for Mutual Understanding were deeply saddened by the death of Ruth Salzman Adams. Ruth enriched immensely the Trust's efforts to encourage closer East-West relations, bringing a breadth of knowledge, a level of curiosity, and a depth of experience to TMU's work that will be greatly missed. Her long and distinguished career in international affairs as an articulate opponent of nuclear weapons, as a staunch advocate for human rights, and as an extraordinary foundation executive is a wonderful reflection of her lifelong dedication to just causes and world peace.
