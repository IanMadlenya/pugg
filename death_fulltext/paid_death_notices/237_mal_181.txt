        CAMPBELL--Patton. New York CIty Opera notes with sadness the passing of our colleague and friend. Since joining the company in 1959 Patton designed costumes for 20 of our productions including the world premieres of Moore's ''The Wings of the Dove'', Hoiby's ''Natalia Petrovna'' and Beeson's ''Lizzie Borden''; plus ''La traviata'' with Patricia Brooks and Placido Domingo, ''The Makropoulos Affair'' with Maralin Niska and ''Susannah'' with Norman Treigle. In addition to designing for other opera companies and on Broadway, Patton held teaching positions at various universities where he enjoyed sharing his wealth of knowledge with his students. He frequently noted how happy he was to ''pass the torch to the next generation''. His passing leaves a large void and he will be missed. We extend our deepest sympathy to his sister Courtney, and his many friends and colleagues. Paul Kellogg General Director
