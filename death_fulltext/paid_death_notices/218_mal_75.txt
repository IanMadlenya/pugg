        SCHACTER -- Ralph. Fawn Associates and Mill Management mourn the passing of Ralph Schacter. Together with partner, Seymour Schwartz, Ralph was responsible for creating Putnam Green, Weaver's Hill, Greenwich Office Park and The Mill in Greenwich, CT. Ralph never allowed his concern for people and causes to take a backseat to the financial bottom line. His compassion and integrity, together with his noncomformity, will remain in our hearts and minds forever.
