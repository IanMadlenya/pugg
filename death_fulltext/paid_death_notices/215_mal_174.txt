        HOTCHKISS--Rollin D. The Rockefeller University community mourns with deep sadness the loss of our distinguished colleague and beloved friend, Rollin D. Hotchkiss. Dr. Hotchkiss was a biochemist and geneticist best known for his seminal contributions to DNA research. A valued member of the Rockefeller University community, since 1935, he will long be remembered for establishing that DNA carries a broad variety of gene traits, for purifying and crystalizing the antibiotics gramicidin and tyrocidine, and for initiating a description of the enzymatic makeup of subcellular particles. A warm and generous colleague and mentor, he trained many younger colleagues who went on to become leaders in the field. Dr. Hotchkiss will be profoundly missed. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his family. Paul Nurse, President David Rockefeller, Honorary Chairman and Life Trustee, Board of Trustees
