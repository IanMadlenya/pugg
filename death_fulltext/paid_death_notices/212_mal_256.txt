        ELIAS--Eli. The officers and members of the New York Skirt & Sportswear Association, Inc. record with profound sorrow the passing of Eli Elias, retired President and Executive Director of the Association. For many decades, he devoted his energy and ability to the advancement of the interests of all association members and of the entire apparel industry and to the maintenance of harmonious management-labor relations. He served with distinction on the Boards of the Federation of Apparel Manufacturers, the Garment Industry Development Corporation, the Educational Foundation of the Fashion Institute of Technology, the High School of Fashion Industries and the Council for American Fashion. He was a long-time management trustee of many union benefit funds. He was truly a giant in the apparel industry and his leadership, integrity, creativity and dedication will be sorely missed. We express our heartfelt condolences to the Elias family. New York Skirt & Sportswear Association, Inc. Jack Glauberman, Exec Dir Counsel
