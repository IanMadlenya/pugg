He taught at the Postdoctoral Program in Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis at NYU and was in a private practice. He maintained a parallel career as a composer of new and electronic music.

        GHENT - Emmanuel, M.D. The William Alanson White Psychoanalytic Institute and Society are saddened by the loss of this exceptional man who was so remarkably present in his quietness. Those who experienced him as a teacher, supervisor, analyst, friend or colleague were fortunate to partake in his world which was so richly filled with his manifold interests. Mannie was a very creative man who could move easily from composing children's songs to inventing time-keeping devices for string players trying to cope with the complex rhythms of modern music, to exploring Eastern spirituality, to solving the puzzles of electronic communication as well as of finances, or to thinking how neurobiology and systems theory would play in the field of psychoanalysis. And yet most of all, he impressed us with his humility and with his wise acceptance of our weaknesses. The image of his thoughtful and deeply kind presence will stay with us. We miss him very much.
