        BARTOS - Armand. The Trustees and staff of The New York Public Library deeply mourn the loss of our great and good friend, Armand Bartos. A brilliant architect and the beloved husband of Celeste Bartos, one of the Library's greatest benefactors, Mr. Bartos was also the father of Library Trustee Emeritus Adam Bartos and father-in-law of Trustee Mahnaz Ispahani. His kind, gentle, and warm presence was one that we treasured enormously at the Library and one that we will miss very, very much. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Celeste Bartos and to the entire Bartos family. Brooke Russell Astor, Honorary Chairman Catherine C. Marron, Chairman Samuel C. Butler, Elizabeth Rohatyn, Marshall Rose, Chairmen Emeriti Paul LeClerc, President
