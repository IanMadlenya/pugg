        WEINSTEIN-Herbert T. Died Tuesday evening of a sudden heart attack. All of us at Proskauer Rose LLP are united in our grief over the loss of this remarkable person. Herb possessed almost unparallelled energy and superior intellect which resulted in accomplishments rarely achieved. He approached every challenge with the same brilliance, confidence and decision making style that defined him. We have all benefited by working with and knowing such a dynamic man. In this time of heartbreaking loss, our sympathy goes out to his wife Wendy Schriber, his children Jordan, Adam and Jonathan, his father Seymour Weinstein and his sister Meryl Berstein.
