        LE CORBEILLER -- Clare. Revered curator at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she served as curator in the Department of European Sculpture and Decorative Arts until her retirement in 2000. Widely respected, especially as a connoisseur and historian of French porcelains and silver, she also greatly furthered knowledge of German and Italian ceramics as well as of China Trade porcelain. She freely shared her erudition and boundless enthusiasm for her chosen subjects in many writings and in colloquy with other curators and students in the Parsons/Cooper-Hewitt Masters Program and the Bard Graduate Center. Her colleagues at the Metropolitan Museum mourn her loss while remembering her bravery and zest, and offer deepest condolences to her beloved husband, Jean, and their daughters, Suzanne and Genevieve.
