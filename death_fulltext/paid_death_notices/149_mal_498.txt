        KRAFT-Gilman, president and owner of Performing Arts magazine, died June 27 following a brief illness. Mr. Kraft founded the theater program magazine in 1966, when the Music Center opened. The publication serves the Orange County Performing Arts Center, the UCLA Center for the Performing Arts, The Pasadena Playhouse, The San Francisco Opera and Ballet, and over 40 venues throughout the state of California. Mr. Kraft was born in New Jersey in 1926, the son of immigrants. He and his brother, the late political columnist, Joseph Kraft, were raised in New York City and attended the Fieldston School. Mr. Kraft served in World War II as a Japanese linguist. At 25, after graduating from Columbia College, Mr. Kraft founded The Reader's Subscription, an intellectual book club, enlisting as editors Lionel Trilling and Jacques Barzun. The Reader's Subscription brought back into print Nathaniel West's ''The Day of the Locust'' and James Agee's ''Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,'' as well as works by Chaucer and many others. Mr. Kraft was then recruited to revive the flagging Broadway program service, Playbill, which he owned and operated for nearly 10 years. In 1966, Kraft moved his family to Los Angeles, where he served the arts community for over 30 years and speculated in commercial and residential real estate. He is survived by his wife, Ruth; his children, Richard Kraft, Dana Kitaj, Susan Pelosa, and Frank Pelosa; and his grandchildren, David, Stephanie, Christopher, Alden, Nathan, Rachael, Joseph and Samuel. A memorial service will be held at 10 AM Thursday, July 1, at the Skirball Cultural Center, 2701 N. Sepulveda Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90049, 310-440-4500.
