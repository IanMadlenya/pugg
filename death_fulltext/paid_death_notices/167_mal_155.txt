        SLADE-Bernard. Survived by his beloved wife Bunny, loving sons Bill & Bob, and devoted sister Lila. Proud grandfather of Jonathan, Gregory and Rebecca. On behalf of his entire family, business associates and his multitude of friends, heartfelt sympathy and condolences are extended on Bernie's untimely passing. Rarely does such a caring and selfless individual come along. Bernie will be missed by all, and certainly by me. Milton Steren
