        KOHL-Schuyler G., M.D., Dr.Ph, The SUNY Downstate Medical Center community mourns the passing of Schuyler G. Kohl, M.D., Dr.Ph, distinguished service professor of obstetrics and gynecology. Dr. Kohl was an expert in maternal and fetal health and a leader in the field of midwifery education and family planning. He was active in the drive to decrease infant mortality, took part in landmark efforts to bring family planning to municipal hospitals, and helped ensure adequate length of stay for mothers and newborns. Our deepest sympathy is extended to his family, colleagues and friends. John C. LaRosa, M.D., President Eugene B. Feigelson, M.D., Dean of the College of Medicine
