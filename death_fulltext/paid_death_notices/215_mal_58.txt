        JACOBS--Harold B. passed away on Thursday, December 2, 2004, at the age of eighty-three. Loving husband of Phyllis, cherished father of Richard and Wendy, adored grandfather of Lisa, Eric and Emily. Hal was the owner and CEO of the Hudson-Shatz Painting Company, headquartered in New York City. He was extremely active in philanthropic activities and led the Real Estate and Construction industry's support of the Association for the Help of Retarded Children (AHRC). The AHRC paid tribute to Hal by naming a group home on the West Side of New York City in his honor. He was also honored by Yeshiva University as their Man of the Year, and was responsible for the annual HudsonShatz Mural Design Contest, which awarded cash prizes to NYC high school students and reproduced the winning mural design on the side of a New York City building. Hal was a kind and generous man, a true friend who could always be counted on. We love you and will miss you greatly. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be sent to the Alzheimer's Association or to the Association for the Help of Retarded Children (AHRC).
        JACOBS--Harold B. Hal, a unique and wonderfully generous and loving brother-inlaw, and a beloved uncle to Jane Dausch and to the late Vicki Matson and Donald Penziner. We will remember him always. Michael and Judy Penziner
