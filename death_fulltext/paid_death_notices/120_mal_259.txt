        HUGHES-William. Age 83. Pianist, accompanist and vocal coach. Died in New York City, December 31, 1996. A Cleveland native, he attended the Cleveland Conservatory of Music and came to New York on a scholarship to continue his musical studies. A graduate of the Juilliard School of Music and a Fellow of the Wurlitzer Foundation in Taos, New Mexico, he was a resident of the Upper West Side of Manhattan for over fifty years. He toured internationally as accompanist to such prominent vocal artists as Rose Bampton, Nadine Conner, Donald Dickson, James King and Blanche Thebom. Taught vocal interpretation at Temple University and served as private vocal coach to hundreds of classical singers. He is survived by several nieces and nephews of Cleveland. He also leaves many devoted friends and colleagues who were profoundly touched not only by his superior and sensitive musicianship, but by his kindness, generosity and flair for living. He will be deeply missed. At his request, there will be no funeral. A memorial service will be announced later.
