        TURECK -- Rosalyn. The House of Steinway & Sons notes with profound sadness the passing of its beloved friend Rosalyn Tureck on July 17 in Riverdale, New York at the age of 88. A native of Chicago, Mme. Tureck studied with Jan Chiapusso, Sophia Brilliant-Liven and later with Olga Samaroff at The Juilliard School. Her legendary Town Hall recitals of 1937 ignited her fame as a Bach specialist. She was a forward thinking musician who championed contemporary composers and inventive programming. A scholar of great renown, her creativity and passion for her music brought her an important public following. Mme. Tureck was a devoted member of the Steinway Artist family for more than six decades, and she was an inspiring force in the world of music. Her loss is deeply felt, but her acclaimed discography will keep her legacy alive for future generations. To her family we extend our heartfelt condolences. Bruce A. Stevens, President Peter B. Goodrich, V.P., Worldwide Concert and Artist Activities >>AD#
