        KENNER--Edythe. Her passing leaves a void in the hearts of the entire musical theatre and cabaret world. Both performers and audiences benefitted from her generosity. At Town Hall we shall never forget the encouragement and support that mid-wifed the birth of our Broadway By The Year and Broadway Cabaret Festival programs. Our deepest sympathy to her son Robert Saffron and her entire family. Town Hall Foundation Marvin Leffler, President
