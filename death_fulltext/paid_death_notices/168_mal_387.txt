        BALK-Harold. The Board of Trustees, staff, families and consumers of Adults and Children with Learning and Developmental Disabilities (ACLD) note with great sadness the passing of Harold Balk. Hal, a long-standing member of the Board, served as President and held many key offices of the organization over the past 30 years. Hal was a prime force in the development of services and programs for children and adults with disabilities. He was a fierce advocate to create opportunities for people with disabilities to live and work in our community. Most of all, Hal wanted these children and adults to have fun and enjoy life like everyone else. All of us who worked with Hal will always remember his honesty, quick wit, wry smile, strength and brilliance. He leaves a legacy at ACLD that will endure for the ages. He was truly a giant among us and we will miss him dearly. Everyone at ACLD extends our deepest sympathy to Hal's family.
