        STACKHOUSE - Thelma. The Board of Directors, other volunteers, and staff of the United Hospital Fund are deeply saddened by the loss of our dear friend and longtime volunteer. For more than 15 years she helped guide the Fund's volunteer initiatives and shared her wisdom and experience as a social worker to ensure better health care for all New Yorkers, particularly children. Her keen sense of social justice and analytic mind were an inspiration to us all. We send our condolences to her family. Howard Smith, Chairman Mary Hanlan Hess, Vice Chairman James R. Tallon, Jr., President
