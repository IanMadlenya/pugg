        KOKKINS-John. In his 102nd year. Dearest friend, you carried in you an ancient spark that made Greece the Cradle of Western Civilization: intellect, creativity, courage and wisdom. Throughout your long life as an American citizen and architect you contributed your talent and energy to the country you loved and to New York City. Your place in our hearts will ever be there. How we will miss you! Rhoda and Herbert G. Cohen
