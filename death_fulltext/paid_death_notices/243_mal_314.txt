        BAREISS--Walter. The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art mourn the death of Walter Bareiss. A businessman, collector, and passionate art lover, Walter was a longstanding friend of the Museum. He joined the Museums Junior Council in 1949 and would go on to serve as Trustee from 1964-1973 and Acting Director from 1969-70. He also served as Chairman of the Painting and Sculpture, Drawings, and Prints and Illustrated Books committees and Chairman of the Art Lending Service. We deeply appreciate Walters generosity to the Museum, particularly his many gifts of art and acquisition funds. We will remember Walter for his commitment, intelligence, sense of humor, remarkable eye, and boundless curiosity about contemporary developments in the art world. We extend our deepest sympathy to his five children and eleven grandchildren. David Rockefeller, Honorary Chairman Ronald S. Lauder, Chairman Emeritus Agnes Gund, President Emerita Robert B. Menschel, Chairman Marie-Jose Kravis, President Glenn D. Lowry, Director The Museum of Modern Art
