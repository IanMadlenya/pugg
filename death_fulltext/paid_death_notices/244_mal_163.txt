        STOLLER--Michael J. Born on the Fourth of July 1931. A graduate of Wharton School of Business, he had a distinguished career as a senior publishing executive at McGraw Hill and was Publisher of Electronic Products, a Hearst Publication. A great lover of life, he was adored and will be deeply missed by his loving companion, Nancy C. Young, his son, Joshua A. Stoller, his step-son, William C. Stone, his grandchildren, Oliver and Owen Stoller and Benjamin and Teah Markstone, by his daughters-in-law Dani Stoller and Carolyn Mark and by many, many others whose lives he touched. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made in his name to The Big Brothers Big Sisters of New York City.
