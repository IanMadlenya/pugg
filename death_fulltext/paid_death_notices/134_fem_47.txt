        BRENNER-Goldie. The Board of Directors, residents and staff of The Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale mourn with sorrow the death of Goldie Brenner, and extend sincere sympathies to her daughters, Edith Everett and Gladys Praigord. Goldie, who would have been 100 this October, was a lady of warmth, kindness and elegance. She will be linked in perpetuity to her fellow River House West tenants through a social fund endowed by Edith and Henry Everett. Our thoughts are with the family in this time of sadness. Milton A. Gilbert, President Bernard Goldberg, Chairman Jacob Reingold, Vice Chairman Daniel A. Reingold, Exec. V.P.
