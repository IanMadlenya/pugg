        KAMINETSKY-Joseph. With profound sorrow, Torah Umesorah, the National Society for Hebrew Day Schools, mourns the passing of its Founding National Director, Rabbi Dr. Joseph Kaminetsky, Z'L. Rabbi Dr. Kaminetsky, working in concert with Torah Umesorah's founder Reb. Shraga Feivel Mendlowitz and the Rabbinical leadership of his time, dedicted his life to the furtherance of Jewish education and authentic Jewish values. He single-handedly took it upon himself to gain support for and create Jewish day schools across the United States-from the centers of Jewish living, to the most remote communities, with little or no Jewish infrastructure. Rabbi Kaminetsky was the embodiment of Torah values and ideals. Through a combination of his extraordinary warmth, his burning desire to spread Torah and his enduring love for the Jewish people, Rabbi Kaminetsky, or ''JK'' as he was affectionately called, succeeded in crashing through the barriers of ignorance, indifference and resistance. His memory will be forever etched in the annals of Jewish history where, as a direct result of his-life work, the Torah Umesorah Day School movement is today 160,000 children strong. Y'hi Zichro Baruch. Rabbi Elya Svei, Chairman, Rabbinic Administrative Board Rabbi Yakov Rajchenbach, Pres. Rabbi Joshua Fishman, Exec V.P. Mr. David Singer, Chair. of Board Dr. Shmuel Zentman, Treasurer
