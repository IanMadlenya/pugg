        KALMUS-Lenore (Flory) Born NY October 24, 1936, died June 2, 1997 after a valiant fight with cancer. Lenore received her B.A. from Wellesley in 1957, and her LL.B career from New York University in 1962. She began her law career in government, and entered private practice in 1966 with the late Norman Roy Grutman. A creative and tireless litigator, she joined the firm of Bower & Gardner in 1976, and began her concentration in medical-legal matters. She achieved partnership in 1980, in recognition of her incisiveness and intellect. Lenore specialized in representing physicians and hospitals in complex medical litigation, and was acknowledged by many physicians as having a vast medical knowledge. Most importantly, she brought to her clients both passion and insight, which earned her the reputation as an effective and loyal advocate. In 1994 she became a partner in McAloon & Friedman, where she continued to practice until illness prematurely ended a distinguished career. Lenore was a mentor to many young lawyers, and she taught them her love of both law and medicine. Her legaacy will be that she loved her profession, served it with distinction and shared her knowledge with a new generation. She will be deeply missed by her family, friends, colleagues and clients.
