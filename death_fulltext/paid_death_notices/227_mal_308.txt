        GULIELMETTI--Paul M. Lower Manhattan Loft Tenants mourns Paul M. Guielmetti. His legal skill, his cunning, his generosity, and most of all his appetite for the good fight over thirty years helped secure key rights for loft tenants. Paul was there at the start, always played hard, and won precedent-setting cases in every decade. Our condolences to his family, friends and clients past and present. We will all miss him.
