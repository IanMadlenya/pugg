        CHYET - Stanley F. The Board of Trustees, staff, docents, and volunteers of the Skirball Cultural Center, Los Angeles, express our deepest sorrow upon the death of our beloved friend and Assistant to the President/Secretary to the Board of Trustees, Rabbi Stanley F. Chyet. Dr. Chyet led a life remarkable not only for his own accomplishments but also for his influence on the many people whose lives he touched as a husband, father, poet, professor, mentor, rabbi, colleague, and friend. In the early 1980's, he helped forge the vision for the Skirball Cultural Center one that explores the connections between the age-old Jewish heritage and the vitality of American democratic ideals. Dr. Chyet's wisdom, warmth, and passion for American Jewish history helped shape every aspect of the Skirball. Since opening in 1996, the Skirball has welcomed over 3 million visitors. Its core exhibition, ''Visions and Values: Jewish Life from Antiquity to America,'' is to a major degree the product of his scholarship and teaching brilliance, particularly sections that examine the immigration experience and Jewish life in America. Dr. Chyet loved poetry and was a consummate poet. Through his poetry, he extended the human experience by giving voice to the voiceless. He was a utopian in the truest sense of the word. He taught us that a humane and reflective life is possible and that to be human is somehow not to lose hope in the face of despair, to retain humor in the face of catastrophe, and to realize peace without ignoring conflict. His scholarship, his poetry, his defining humility, and his beautiful humanity will continue to inspire us and all future generations who visit the Skirball Cultural Center. He has left us with an enormous legacy. Howard I. Friedman Chairman, Board of Trustees Skirball Cultural Center Uri D. Herscher Founding President and CEO Skirball Cultural Center
