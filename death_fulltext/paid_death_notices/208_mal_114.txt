        LYNCH--Joseph F. On May 8, 2004. He is survived by his beloved wife Peggy, his two daughters Maureen and Carol, his late son Michael, his most beloved sisters Ann and Agnes and various nieces and nephews. Joseph served in WWII during the invasion of Normandy. He was stationed in Okinawa when the atom bomb was dropped. He was a member of the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. He had a story about everything and a punchline to go with it. He will be missed by many who knew him as the mayor of 50th St. We salute you, Joe Lynch, and may the angels of Ireland carry you. Friends may call at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Ave at 81st St, Monday, 2-5 and 7-9 pm. Mass of Christian Burial Tuesday, 10 am, St. John the Evangelist Church, East 55th St (between 1st and 2nd Ave).
