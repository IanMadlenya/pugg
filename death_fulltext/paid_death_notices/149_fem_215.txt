        STOLZ-Marguerite (''Snoekie''). We mourn the loss of Snoekie and extend our condolences to her loving husband Charles and extraordinary children Ruth, Andrew and Mary. She was the beloved aunt of Margot, Lenny, Nikki, Benjamin and Barbara; great aunt of David, Barbara, Jeremy, Amy, Daniel, Shilpa, Rachel and Josh; greatgreat aunt of Talia, Isaiah, Satya, Jack and Moses. She was an extraordinary woman, a social worker before most women contemplated careers. In her 80s she attended college courses with her husband. She will be remembered for her unbounded generosity, her attention to people and for her wonderful seders. She remembered everyone's birthday, and was a star juggler of people's lives and loves, remembering conversations and feelings unnoticed or forgotten by others. We, in turn, will never forget her.
