        HERMAN--Stewart W. The trustees of Union Chapel in the Grove, Shelter Island Heights, New York, mourn the passing of their past chairman, Dr. Stewart W. Herman. This internationally renowned Lutheran theologian energized our chapel in his retirement years, developed its endowment and its interdenominational preaching program and expanded its community outreach. We will miss his guidance and his presence and extend our sympathies to his wife, Lyn, and their family.
