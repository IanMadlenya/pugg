        HICKEY--Francis (Frank) G. 79, of Scottsdale, AZ, passed away after a long illness on August 9, 2006. He was born in Stevens Point, WI on August 9, 1927. Frank was successful as both a businessman and as a philanthropist. In business, he served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of General Instrument Corporation (NYSE) for 16 years until the company's sale to Forstmann Little and Co. in 1990. During his tenure at General Instrument, the company accomplished record levels of performance in revenue, earnings, and cash flow and became the industry leader in many markets including cable television electronics, coaxial cable, satellite encryption systems, power semiconductors and microcircuits for handheld calculators, TV games, and television and auto radio tuners. General Instrument was subsequently acquired by Motorola in 2000. Frank founded Manhattan Partners Inc. in 1991, through which he acquired several set-top repair companies in the Cable TV industry. He was active in these businesses until early 2005, when they were sold so that he could devote more time and resource to his philanthropic activities. Frank was a major supporter of International Medical Corps, headquartered in Los Angeles, CA, where he served on the Board of Directors for several years and remained a Director Emeritus. He founded the Hickey Family Foundation in 2004, which strives to save lives and relieve suffering by supporting medical training and technology research. Mr. Hickey is survived by his daughter, Stephanie.
