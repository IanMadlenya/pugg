        JOSEPH--Andrew Mark. Age 59, left us on November 1, 2005 in NYC. Loving and beloved husband to Terry for 37 years. Retired as NYC Deputy Comptroller for Budget, former associate director NYS Financial Control Board, former official Social Services Employees Union Local 371. He held an MBA from Baruch College and a BA from Queens College. Andy loved mentoring young people, traveling, scuba diving, art and music. Andy was so knowledgeable about history that he could talk about Alexander the Great and Shakespeare as though they were his friends. He was the man you'd talk to when you needed to know anything. A thirty year Hodgkin's disease survivor, he lived each day to the fullest. Andy is irreplaceable to us all. He will be remembered forever by his many friends, relatives and colleagues. The world is a better place because of Andy. Funeral services will be held Sunday, November 6 at 1:15 Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 W. 76 St. Charitable contributions preferred.
