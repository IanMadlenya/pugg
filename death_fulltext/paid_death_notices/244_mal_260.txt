        JAMES--David William. Born David William James on April 25, 1949 in Norman, Oklahoma to John and Mary James and beloved by those who knew him, David passed over, after a long and courageous battle with lung cancer on Saturday, May 26, 2007 at 2:28pm surrounded by his loved ones at the home he shared with his partner, Dinda Andrews in Manhattan. A devoted father himself, David is survived by his own father John James, sisters Bonnie and Jennifer, brother John and his two most cherished daughters ''The Girls'', Maris and Dana. Diverse in skills and abilities, talented yet humble and extremely human, David would be more prone to describing himself as an electrical contractor, however, his artistry infused his work which has contributed to the success of many upscale projects in SOHO and Tribeca. His craftsmanship was respected and admired by owners, architects and other tradesmen who worked with him. David graduated from the University of Georgia and went on to acquire his Masters of Fine Arts from the University of Wisconsin. He then became a Professor of Painting at the University of Georgia. David moved to New York City in 1977 where he has lived since. Pursuing his artistic goals he was affiliated with the Semaphore Gallery in SOHO and the Ruth Siegal Gallery on 57th Street. He established himself as a noteworthy New York artist most known for his large 3-D abstract paintings. Jacketless in the depth of winter with his tools in hand David will be most remembered for his warmth, generosity, forgiveness, talent, insights, honesty, integrity, overall humanity and not least his humor, all of which will undoubtedly leave smiles on so many faces for the years to come. A ''Celebration of his Life'' will be held at The Conservancy at Central Park near 105th Street and 5th Avenue from 4-5pm on Wednesday, May 30, with a reception to follow at Hotel Wales at 92nd Street and Madison Avenue from 58pm.
