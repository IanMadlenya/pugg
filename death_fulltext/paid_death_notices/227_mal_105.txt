        LITWIN--Thomas is deeply mourned by the Advisory Council of the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art, Cornell University. He was a man of effervescent good humor, a love of life, and a fondness for magic tricks, a personality that charmed everyone he met. Combined with his warmth and optimism were strength and courage. He was a model to us all, and will be greatly missed.
