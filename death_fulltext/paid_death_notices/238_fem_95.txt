        BONCHICK--Anna Natalie, passed away suddenly and unexpectedly on November 9th. Mother to three, grandmother to six and surrogate mother to multitudes, she will be missed by the many friends and family whom she would always welcome into her home. Her giving to the community manifested itself in many ways, including the Harrison PTA, the Girl Scouts, Meals on Wheels and many volunteer activities at the Jewish Community Center in Harrison, NY. Anna's presence and generosity was felt by many, and the community she lived in is that much less without her. She is survived by her devoted daughter Ruth and her sons Michael and Richard and her daughter - in - laws Christine and Robin. She will live on in cherished memory by her grandchildren, Jaime, Andrew, Maddie, Sarah, David and Leah. She is also survived by her brother Jerry Robinson and sister-in-law Gail Robinson. She will be missed by her soulmate and partner, Mel Sirota who stood by her side throughout the years and to the very end. She was predeceased by her former husband, Robert Bonchick. A memorial service is planned for Anna on December 3rd, 2006 at the Jewish Community Center of Harrison, NY on Union Avenue. In lieu of flowers, her children request that contributions be made to the Anna Bonchick Memorial Scholarship fund, which Ruth, Michael and Richard are establishing in her honor. For information regarding this fund please contact her children directly.
