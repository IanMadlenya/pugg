        HAAR-Arline. The Jewish Theological Seminary family records with sorrow the passing of Arline Haar, whose commitment to JTS, the Conservative movement and the Jewish community was reflected in the life she lived and in the lives of her children and grandchildren. She and her late husband George endowed the annual kallah in memory of their son, Marc Steven; following his father's footsteps, their son Geoffrey serves as a member of the JTS Rabbinical School board of overseers. Our condolences to her children and grandchildren and the entire family. May her memory be for a blessing. Ismar Schorsch, Chancellor Gershon Kekst, Chairman
