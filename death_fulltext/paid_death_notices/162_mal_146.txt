        MAZUR-Abraham. The members of Lindsley F. Kimball Research Institute, a division of the New York Blood Center, mourn the loss of Dr. Mazur, former Vice President for Research. He played a vital role in the creation of the research arm of the Blood Center, which he served diligently for many years. He was a consummate teacher, admired for his wisdom, generosity and fairness. We extend our sincere condolences to his family.
