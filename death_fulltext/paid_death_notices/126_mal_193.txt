        SCHWARTZ-Robert J. The Board of Directors, Members and Staff of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association mourn the passing of our friend, colleague and former Director. His many contributions to the Association included serving as a Director for three terms, acting Executive Director, Treasurer and Chairman of several committees. ISDA will miss his leadership and enthusiasm and the boundless energy and commitment he brought to all that he did. We offer our deepest sympathies to his family.
