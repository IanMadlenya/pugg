        RICHARDSON-Elliot L. The directors of College Savings Bank, with profound sorrow, mourn the passing of our former director. His commitment to making higher education more accessible led to the establishment of our institution and the Education Individual Retirement Account. His dedication, generosity, and warmth of spirit will be greatly missed.
