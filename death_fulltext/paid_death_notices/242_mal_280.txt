        ROSIN--Axel G. The Board and staff of the Scherman Foundation are deeply saddened by the death of our beloved chairman emeritus. A courageous man, leaving Nazi Germany and arriving in America in 1934, Axel Rosin went on to become the president of the Book-of-theMonth Club, founded by his father-in-law, Harry Scherman, and the extraordinary chairman and guiding spirit of the Scherman Foundation. His humanity, his vision, his unfailing sense of right and wrong have been critical touchstones to the work of the Foundation. He believed in the effectiveness of nonprofit leaders and encouraged our support of thousands of organizations in NYC and across the nation that advocate for a more just world, through their activities in nurturing community development, protecting the environment, upholding women's reproduction rights and health, defending human and civil rights, working for peace, and advancing the arts. We extend our love and condolences to his wife, our long-time board member, Kathy; his daughters Karen Sollins, our esteemed chairman, and Susanna Bergtold, our fellow board member; and his grandchildren Peter Sollins and Amy Bergtold. Board Members: Hillary Brown, David Jones, Gordon Litwin, John O'Neil, Tony Schulte, Marcia Thompson, John Wroclawski Sandra Silverman, President; Mike Pratt, Treasurer
