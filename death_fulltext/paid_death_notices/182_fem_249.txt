        HALPERN-Edith. Peter Martins, Howard Solomon, Chairman of the Board, Robert I. Lipp, President, the Directors, dancers and staff of New York City Ballet mourn the loss of Edith Halpern, an extraordinary friend and colleague. Edith was singular in her passionate commitment to the work of George Balanchine, the company he founded and the artists who realized his vision. For over three decades she tirelessly brought her energy, enthusiasm, and organizing skills to enlarging NYC Ballet's base of support and circle of dedicated friends. While tiny in stature, Edith will always be remembered for her unerring eye, exquisite taste, high principles and great heart. She demanded the best of all around her and always gave the same. Edith was a Charter Member of the NYC Ballet Board of Directors, which honored her in 1993 by naming her the Company's first Director Emerita. We treasure her presence in our lives and honor her memory in all that we do. Our thoughts are with Nathan, her son, Michael, and all her family.
