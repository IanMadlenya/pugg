        TOPAL--Lorraine. The partners and staff of Rothschild Topal Miller & Kraft, PC, mourn the loss of our ''First Lady'', Lorraine Topal, the wife of our partner Jack Topal and mother of our partner Steven Topal. We extend our most heartfelt sympathy to the entire Topal family: Jack, Steven, Mark, Cheryl, Scott and Andrew. Lorraine was a strong, determined woman who fought a courageous battle not to let her illness deprive her of enjoying the special events of the past year. She graced our presence as an individual who was concerned, intelligent and interested in all that was happening. Her smile and sense of humor was always present, even during the difficult times of her illness. She was truly a lady. We will miss her.
