        JARCHO-Saul, M.D. The Association of the Attending Staff of the Mount Sinai Hospital mourns the passing of our long-standing colleague and mentor. Dr Jarcho came to Mount Sinai as an intern in 1931 and served the institution and its patients for more than 50 years. A highly respected scholar and teacher, he will be remembered as an outstanding medical historian as well as for his clinical contributions. We extend our sincere condolences to his wife and family.
