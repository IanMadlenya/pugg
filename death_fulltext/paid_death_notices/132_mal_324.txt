        ASHMORE-Harry S. Pulitzer Prize winning Editor of the Arkansas Gazette, courageous civil rights leader and brave crusader against segregation, for over 40 years was an active member of the Board of Directors of the National Committee for an Effective Congress. His colleagues at the NCEC will cherish his memory and miss his wisdom, his leadership and warm sense of humor. We extend our sincere condolences to his wife, Barbara and daughter Anne.
