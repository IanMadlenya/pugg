        ROBBINS--Hon. Alfred S. The Board of Directors, Administration and Medical Staff of Winthrop-University Hospital are deeply saddened by the passing of Judge Alfred S. Robbins, a good friend and great leader. Admitted to the New York State Bar in 1957, Judge Robbins' abilities were evident early in his career in the legal profession and he rose to the position of Justice of the New York State Supreme Court in 1979. Elected to the Board of Directors of Winthrop-University Hospital in 1974, he was often recognized for his analytical skills, personal commitment and integrity. The Judge's leadership qualities were exhibited during his tenure as Chairman of the Board from 1988-1994. His many achievements included the construction of an Ambulatory Surgery Center, MRI Center, and the opening of Long Island's largest hospital-based Dialysis Center. He was named Trustee of the Year in 1994 and in 2003, in recognition of his three decades of service to Winthrop, Judge Robbins was elected to the esteemed position of Honorary Director. His loyalty and devotion will never be forgotten. Our sincere condolences to his wife Louise and his family. Patrick K. Long Chairman of the Board Daniel P. Walsh, President, & Chief Executive Officer Steven Carsons, MD, President, Executive Committee of the Medical Staff Robert Bartolomeo, MD President, Medical Staff Organization
