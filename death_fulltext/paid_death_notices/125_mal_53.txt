        STONE-J. Jacques. The Anti-Defamation League mourns the passing of our long-time friend, J. Jacques Stone, at the end of Shloshim, the 30 day period of mourning. He was advisor, friend and dedicated ADL supporter for more than half a century, serving on the National Law and Civil Rights Committees and the New York Regional Board. Our deepest sympathies go to his wife, Janet, and his family. May they be consoled among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. David H. Strassler National Chairman Abraham H. Foxman National Director
