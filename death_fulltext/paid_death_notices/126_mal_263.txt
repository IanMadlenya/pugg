        SCOTT-William R. A 19th century gentleman in tune with the 20th century, Bill's warm generosity to the musicians and everyone associated with New School Concerts and the New York String Orchestra Seminar was matched by his love of typography and the art of fine printing, the community of North Bennington, the children's books he lovingly published for many years and the children of all ages for whom they were intended. His spirit will always illuminate the Concerts and Seminar. We join his extended family in celebrating his life.
