        SIEGAL--Gilbert. March 8, 2004. Lawyer, scholar and warm individual who exercised outstanding intellect modestly, concisely and cogently. Treasured counselor to clients, colleagues and friends. Extraordinary skills with words, which he loved, was his hallmark, precise words in correct order whether written or spoken. He passed as he lived, braving dangers just like the much decorated U.S. Air Force navigator he was in World War II. He was a participant in the daring and historic allied bombing of the Nazi oil fields in Ploesti, Romania. To bring him to mind sparks delight in his kindness and abundant love for his wife Aranka, daughter Rise, son Joseph and many friends. To his family is offered condolences for their irreplaceable loss. His humble dedication and reverence for God assures he rests in the bosom of Abraham.
