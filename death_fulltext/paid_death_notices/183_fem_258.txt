        LEHMAN-Mary. The American Jewish Committee is deeply saddened by the death of Mary Lehman, one of AJC's most active and dedicated leaders. Mary sat on our Board of Govenors, Board of Trustees, Womens Campaign Board and National Leadership Council and was the immediate past Chair of AJC Audit Committee. Her efforts were always imbued with compassion, her judgement always principled and guided by devotion to the Jewish community and all people of good will. She will be sorely missed. We send heartfelt condolences to her children and to the rest of her greiving family. Harold Tanner, President David A. Harris, Exec Director E. Robert Goodkind, Chair, Board of Govenors Shula Bahat, Assoc Exec Director
