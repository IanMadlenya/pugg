        MOORE-Roy W., Jr. The Board of Trustees, administration and staff of St Lukes Roosevelt Hospital Center mourn the passing of our distinguished Honorary Trustee. Mr. Moore joined the board of the Roosevelt Hospital in 1964 and served with distinction until 1979, when he became an Honorary Trustee at the time of Roosevelt's merger with St Luke's. He exemplified the many grateful patients, who have come to serve the Hospital Center through the years and he will be missed. Lawrence S. Huntington Chairman of the Board, Ronald C. Ablow, M.D., President
