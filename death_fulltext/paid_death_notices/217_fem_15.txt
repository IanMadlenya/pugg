        CARLSON--Kay (Kathleen). All of us are extremely saddened by Kay's passing and extend our deepest sympathies to her family and friends. She was a distinguished colleague and a dear friend to many of us. During 20 years with Equitable and AXA Financial, mostly as President of AXA Foundation, she developed nationally recognized programs in the fields of eldercare, AIDS, and higher education which steadily increased AXA's philanthropic role. In 2002, she oversaw the development of AXA Achievement-providing America's youth with advice and access necessary to succeed in college and beyond. We are extremely proud of all of her achievements. We will miss her greatly. AXA Financial, Inc.
