        MAASS-Richard. The students, faculty, and administrators at New York University express deep sorrow on the loss of Richard Maass. His support and guidance will be deeply missed. The Richard Maass Collection of Westchester and New York State, now housed in NYU's Fales Library, will be a lasting reminder of his generosity and scholarship. Our condolences to Dolly and his entire family. Carlton C. Rochell Dean, NYU Libraries
