        MORGENS--Frank. Born in Lodz, Poland, January 8, 1911, died August 16, 2004. A gentleman in every sense of the word. Marie, his wife of over 60 years, died in 1998. Father of Sylvia Karchmar and Anne Lewin. Grandfather of David and Matthew Lewin, and Lara and Dorian Karchmar. Great grandfather of Benjamin and Dylan Orr; Noah and Milo Sobel-Lewin, and Violet Kotzin. Holocaust survivor. While he and his family were living as Christians in the town of Olsztyn, Poland, he served in the Home Army (the AK). Poland awarded him the Partisan Cross and the Silver Service Medal and he received the Rabbi Harold Schulweis Award for recognizing the obligation of Jews to honor Righteous Gentiles. He personally sustained many individual Gentile rescuers in their material needs, providing for their medical care and the education of their children. ''Years At The Edge of Existence,'' his memoir chronicling the family's wartime experiences, was published in 1996. His bravery and unwavering moral compass saw his family and numerous others safely through the war, and will continue to provide a model for the generations that succeed him. Memorial service Thursday, August 19, at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 76th and Amsterdam Ave, 11:15AM.
