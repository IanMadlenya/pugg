        WEISSBERG-Herbert R. On July 3, 2003. Lived the classic American dream. One of five children born to his immigrant parents in New York's fabled Lower East Side, he slowly but relentlessly worked his way up to being a prominent New York hotelier. Along the way, he taught English to immigrants at night school and helped assemble B-29 engines during WWII. Like many businesspeople who came of age during the Great Depression, he learned his hotel trade handson, making beds, running the switchboard, showing rooms and learning from others over a nickel coffee at the Automat. At one time, he owned major hotels in Chicago, Palm Beach, New Orleans, Washington, D.C., Baltimore as well as Puerto Rico, Venezuela and Costa Rica. Since the late 1950s, his great pride and joy was the Gramercy Park Hotel, which he owned and ran with one brief interruption, for almost forty years. It was truly a family operation - countless hotel employees had worked for him long past normal retirement age and his deep affection for them went well beyond business relationships. He repeatedly refused to sell the property despite handsome offers, explaining ''I have to take care of my people...where else can they find a job?'' This affection was mutual. His commitment to his own family knew no bounds, especially when it came to education. Seeing his children and grandchildren graduate from prestigious schools on their way to their own versions of the American dream gave him immense joy. His wife of fifty years, Ruth Weissberg, was very much his business partner and a loving wife who, like her husband, dotted on her children and grandchildren. He is survived by Ruth, three children, seven grandchildren and one great grandchild. For his family, hundreds of former employees and all those who knew him, his death a few weeks shy of his 91st birthday is truly the passing of an era. Services Monday, July 7th, 12:45PM at ''The Riverside'', 76 St and Amsterdam Ave.
