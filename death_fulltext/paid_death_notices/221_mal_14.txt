        GELERIS--Paul. The American Technion Society (ATS) expresses its profound sorrow at the loss of Dr. I. Paul Geleris of Glendora, CA, a longtime, committed supporter. Along with his wife Marilyn, Dr. Geleris was a Technion Guardian, having reached the highest level of support for Israel, the Technion and the ATS. They established the Dr. I. Paul and Marilyn Geleris Program in Laboratory Medicine and the Geleris Symposium, and provided generously for student scholarships at the Technion. Dr. Geleris was a medical pioneer in his Glendora, CA community where he was among the founders of three hospitals and where he established the area's first medical laboratory and a senior apartment community. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife Marilyn, his sons Andrew and Joe, his daughters-in-law and his six grandchildren. Dr. Stephen A. Laser, President Evelyn Berger, Chairman of the Board Melvyn H. Bloom, Executive Vice President Edith Fischer, Western Region President David Polak, Western Region Chair Diane Siegel, Western Region Director
