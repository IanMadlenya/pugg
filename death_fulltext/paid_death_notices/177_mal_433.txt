        HALASZ-Laszlo. New York City Opera mourns the pasing of Laszlo Halasz, the first artistic and musical director of our company. The enthusiastic vision, shared by Mr. Halasz and Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, of a company with young singers and performances at affordable prices has continued unabated for almost sixty years. He established a formidable roster of singers and conductors and began an eclectic repertory of operas that has withstood the test of time. A champion of minority singers, he presented both Todd Duncan and Robert McFerrin in their New York debuts, creating the opportunity for them to have major careers. He conducted a production of Tosca as the inaugural performance of City Opera on February 21, 1944, and also led the American premiere of Ariadne auf Naxos, the New York premiere of The Love for Three Oranges and the world premiere of Troubled Island, among many others. City Opera, & the entire music world, is indebted to him for his tenacity, enthusiasm & devotion to our company. He will be missed. Paul Kellogg General Director
