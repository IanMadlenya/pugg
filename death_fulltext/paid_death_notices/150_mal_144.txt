        BECKER-Ted E. Sr. M D. The Child Analysts of The New York Psychoanalytic Institute mourn the loss of their esteeemed colleague, Dr. Ted E. Becker Sr. He had a unique ability to understand children, and was an outstanding and gifted child analyst. He was responsible for training a generation of child analysts during the years he chaired the Child Analysts Committee. His interest, enthusiasm and commitment to child analysis, his skills as a teacher and supervisor, his personal warmth, his directness and integrity, served as an inspiration and model for us all, and drew many to the study of child analysis. He was our friend and guiding spirit. Our heartfelt sympathy to his wife, Dr. Amy Becker, and to his family.
