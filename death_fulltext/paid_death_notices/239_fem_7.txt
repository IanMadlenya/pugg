        ZALLMAN--Arlene, Composer, (Philadelphia, September 9, 1934) died at home early Saturday after a long struggle with breast cancer. She is survived by her daughters Minna and Martha Proctor, and grandsons Silas Pilapil and Issac Zallman Anastas. She was a passionate mother and grandmother, an extraordinary friend, extending her love and affection without bounds. Her absence will be felt profoundly. A professor of music at Wellesley College for over 30 years, she was an inspiration to students and colleagues alike. She was ambitious, indefatigable, and devoted to beauty --her extraordinary music fed by poetry, art, her friends and teachers; by fields of yellow grass, church bells on the hill, and the silent meow of a stray cat who'd come to live on the front porch. She was laid to rest in Wildwood Cemetery, Amherst Massachusetts. Remembrances can be made to the Arlene Zallman Fund for students at the Wellesley College Music Department or the MacDowell Colony, Peterborough, New Hampshire.
