        VANE--Sir John, FRS. The Fellows of the Biotechnology Study Center, NYU School of Medicine, mourn the death on Friday, November 19th of Sir John Vane, D.Phil., FRS in Farnborough, Kent, UK. Sir John, a founding Fellow of our Center, was most recently founding director of the prestigious William Harvey Research Institute in London. He was perhaps the most distinguished pharmacologist of his day (1927-2004), receiving the Nobel Prize in 1982 for his work on prostaglandins. He discovered prostacyclin, a protective factor for blood vessels, and went on to show that aspirin-like drugs inhibit the COX 1 and COX 2 enzymes that form prostaglandins. By explaining how low doses of aspirin prevent clots, strokes and heart attacks, he made aspirin one of the most common drugs used to treat and prevent heart disease. Sir John's work also led to captopril, the first of a widely used family of medicines called ACE inhibitors. His discoveries may have saved more lives than any since the polio vaccine; they have revolutionized the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Sir John was a bubble in the lab, a scholar at heart, and a gentleman in the world of science. Colleagues and competitors will miss his wit as much as his wisdom. We extend our deepest sympathy to Lady Daphne Vane, to Nikki, Mandy, and their families. Gerald Weissmann for the Fellows of the Biotechnology Study Center of NYU School of Medicine
