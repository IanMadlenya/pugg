        BOARDMAN--Seymour. Passed away October 3, age 84. A productive and widely respected abstract artist represented in numerous museum and private collections. An artist who expressed his direct experience and willingness to take risks in the pursuit of ambitious painting. He exhibited with Martha Jackson, Stephen Radich and A.M. Sachs. Since 1984 he has been represented by the Anita Shapolsky Gallery. He will be greatly missed by the artists, staff and all others who were lucky enough to meet him. I grieve deeply at the loss of a good friend and a truly great artist the knowledgeable art world will one day appreciate for his independence and excellence. A memorial exhibition will be held at the Anita Shapolsky Gallery, December--March 2006. Anita Shapolsky
