        EDELMAN-Hal. We mourn the loss of Hal Edelman, our architect and friend. Astute in design, sensitive to community concerns, his legacy to us is the Two Bridges Urban Renewal District on the Lower East Side. A complex of over 1500 units of affordable housing and commercial enterprises, it exemplifies his vision of community. Hal didn't just build buildings, he built communities. His buildings are not just bricks and mortar, but true homes. With so much left to be done, Hal leaves us at an untimely moment. We convey our deepest sympathy to his wife, Judy Edelman, and his associates. Two Bridges Neighborhood Council
