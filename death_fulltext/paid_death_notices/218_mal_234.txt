        STERN--Harry. The Board of Directors, members and staff of JOFA, the Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance, extend their heartfelt condolences to our esteemed Board member Zelda Stern, upon the passing of her beloved father, Harry Stern. An industrialist, philanthropist, and Jewish communal leader, Harry Stern was an ardent Zionist. He actively supported many Jewish organizations, both in the US and in Israel and established university centers for technology education, science and disease research and Israel studies that bear his name. May Zelda and the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Carol Newman, President Robin Bodner, Exec. Director
