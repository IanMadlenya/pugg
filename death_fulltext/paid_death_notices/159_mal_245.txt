        AUERBACH-Gerald. We mourn the loss of this dear friend and Director of MDA's Television Production Division. An extraordinarily talented film and television director and producer, Jerry created his first film for the Association in 1956. He produced thousands of educational videos during some forty-five years of helping the family's MDA serves-many of which were featured on and contributed to the success of the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon. For decades, Jerry traveled the country each year to create the Telethon profiles of families served by MDA that brought an intimate, warmly human dimension to MDA's appeals. Many of his profiles were so powerful that pledge phones from coast to coast were jammed following their airing. Similarly, Jerry created for MDA some of the most impactful TV public service announcements ever seen, and educational video material that informed physicians and their patients alike, and inspired tremendous volunteer support of MDA throughout the nation. Jerry's indefatigable creative genius has immeasurabely advanced the battle against neuromuscular diseases. Millions affected by these progressive disorders worldwide are in his debt. Jerry's unparalleled productions played a key role in MDA being honored by the American Medical Association with a Lifetime Achievement Award ''for significant and lasting contributions to the health and welfare of humanity''. We extend heartfelt condolences to his wife, Elaine, and to their four children. Jerry Lewis, National Chairman Robert Bennett, President Robert Ross, Executive Director Jerry Weinberg, Director of Field Organization Muscular Dystrophy Association
