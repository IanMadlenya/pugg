        VARNEDOE--Kirk. It is with the greatest saddness that the Trustees and Staff of The Museum of Modern Art mourn the untimely death of their dear friend and former colleague, Kirk Varnedoe, who was for many years the Museum's Chief Curator in the Department of Painting and Sculpture. Kirk leaves and extraordinary legacy, for he was a man of many talents--a brilliant curator, writer, teacher, lecturer, scholar, and mentor to younger colleagues during his 15year association with MoMA. An astute historian of the Museum's collection and of modern and contemporary art, he negotiated crucial acquisitions and organized landmark exhibitions. His deep friendships with artists greatly benefited the Museum in myriad ways. Some of these friendships developed out of the artist-organized exhibitions, ''Artist's Choice,'' which Kirk created and directed. We extend our most heartfelt sympathy to his wife Elyn Zimmerman, to his brothers Samuel and Gordon Varnedoe, and to his sister Comer Meadows.

        VARNEDOE--Kirk. We are so saddened by the news of Kirk's death. His loss creates a great void in our lives as we shared a similar passion for art, people, and for The Museum of Modern Art. We first got to know Kirk in 1986 when we were living in Austria and Kirk was organizing MoMA's exhibition, ''Vienna 1900.'' His grace, diplomacy, and brilliance in the complicated loan negotiations were matched by his great knowledge of this magnificent period in art history. We deeply enjoyed his friendship, and admired his great talents as an art historian, always learning and seeing things in a new way. He lived his life to the fullest, sharing it with his beloved wife, Elyn Zimmerman. As he bravely met the challenges of his illness, he never ceased writing and lecturing. We warmly remember his wry sense of humor and special smile. Our thoughts are with Elyn and Kirk's brothers Samuel and Gordon and his sister, Comer Meadows. Jo Carole and Ronald Lauder
        VARNEDOE--Kirk. We honor Kirk, our beloved teacher and friend. His pyrotechnic intellect, humor, courage and sweetness will always inspire us. Our love to Elyn, Sam, Comer and Gordon. Patricia Berman Robert Lubar Sam Engelstad Jacob Engelstad
