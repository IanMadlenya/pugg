        VEREY-Rosemary, O.B.E. The Board, and staff of The New York Botanical Garden deeply regret the loss of Rosemary Verey, O.B.E., the maker of Barnsley House garden, and a Distinguished Counsellor to the Board of the Garden. Mrs. Verey died last week in England at the age of 82. One of the most eminent figures in 20th and 21st Century horticulture, Rosemary was a great garden historian, garden designer, plantswoman, garden writer and teacher about plants and gardening. Through her magnificent literary oeuvre of 18 titles, her television series, and her extensive lecturing, she imparted the art and joy of gardening to a whole generation. Rosemary was a beloved member of our family, a mentor to many of us. We are all honored to have been her students and friends. Her legacy will include the Rosemary Verey Ornamental Vegetable Garden, which she designed for a beautiful site here . A memorial service will be held in September for Rosemary's American friends. We extend our most sincere condolences to her family. Wilson Nolen, Chairman Gregory Long, President The New York Botanical Garden.
