        LEVINE-Maurice. We mourn the passing of Maurice Levine, whose dedication to the American Popular Songbook was epitomized by more than a quarter of a century of ''Lyrics & Lyricists.'' From ''Music in the Air,'' which Maurice conducted in its 1951 Broadway revival, comes a most fitting epitaph: ''The Song is You.'' Our condolences to Maurice's immediate family and his extended family at the 92nd Street Y. The Rodgers and Hammerstein families and The R & H Organization.
        LEVITAS-Esther (Fera). Beloved wife of the late Sol Levitas, devoted mother of Nora and Mitchel (Gloria), cherished grandmother of Danny, Tony, Abby, Joel and Marshall. Graveside services today, 1 PM, Cedar Park Cemetery, Paramus, NJ. Call Parkside Chapels for further information.
