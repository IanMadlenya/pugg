        ALTIMARI-Frank X. The Touro Law Center's faculty, administration, staff, students and alumni mourn the loss of Judge Altimari, a great jurist and humanitarian. Judge Altimari was deeply involved with the Law Center. He inaugurated our Distinguished Jurist in Residence program and was a beloved member of our adjunct teaching faculty. Judge Altimari was a man of many talents. The Law Center is the home of a magnificent piece of sculpture he created for us as a memorial to the Holocaust. Judge Altimari's sculpture is entitled ''Remember;'' we at Touro always will remember Judge Altimari. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his family, to whom he was so devoted. Howard A. Glickstein Dean, Touro Law Center
