        BOILLOT-Lynn Hochschild. The Trustees and staff of the Adirondack Museum mourn the loss of Lynn Hochschild Boillot, a trustee from 1984 to present. During these years her wise counsel, willingness to work, continuity with the founder, and generosity were invaluable to the museum. We shall miss the quality of her presence and her enthusiasm. We extend our profound sympathies to her sons and daughters-in-law. Robert R. Worth President, Board of Trustees The Adirondack Museum
