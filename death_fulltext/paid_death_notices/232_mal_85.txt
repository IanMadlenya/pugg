Honey and Norman, Lynne, June, MaryAnn and Mort, Connie and Allen. $(6$)RUBIN--William. Good-bye, dear friend. We will surely miss you. Rest peacefully, Gayle Morrow and Family $(6$)RUBIN--Martin. The Board of Directors, officers, and staff of Parsons Brinckerhoff (PB) mourn the passing of Martin (Marty) Rubin, the firm's former Chairman. Marty passed away on May 7 in San Diego. He was 74. A native of Brooklyn, Marty joined PB in 1956, following his graduation from City College of New York and service in the U.S. Army. He was made a partner of PB in 1972. Two years later, he helped guide the restructuring of the company from a partnership into an employee - owned corpora tion. He was elected Chairman in 1994 and served in that capacity until 1997. He retired in 2004. Marty was involved with several of PB's most important projects, including Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), Los Angeles Metro Rail, and Hawaii's Interstate Route H-3. So much of what PB is today is due to Marty's vision and commitment, and we owe it to his memory to continue the company in the fashion which he was so instrumental in shaping. We extend our sympathies to Marty's wife, Maxine, and his children, Steven, Michael, Michelle, and Deborah. Thomas J. O'Neill Chairman and CEO Parsons Brinckerhoff Inc.
