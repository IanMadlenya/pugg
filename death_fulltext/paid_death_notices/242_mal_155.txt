        EDELMAN--Barry. His accomplishments and pleasures were many and wideranging: father, businessman, world traveler, and joyful fan of the fabulous, but his true genius was for loving kindness. He was greatly loved in return, and his sudden death leaves gaping holes in so many lives. Long may he live in our hearts and memories; we are better people for having known him, and blessed to have called him nephew and cousin. The Wollman/Rubin/ Berkowitz Family
