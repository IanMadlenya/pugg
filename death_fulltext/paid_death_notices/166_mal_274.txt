        RHODES-John B., Sr. The Board of Trustees of The New York Institute for Special Education (founded in 1831 at The New York Institute for the Education of the Blind) records with deep regret the death of its beloved and distinguished member. Mr. Rhodes was a dedicated friend of the Institute. He ably assisted in its growth as a Trustee and member of numerous committees for 25 years. His guidance in long-range planning and his important contribution to the establishment of our Cornerstone Literary Program was invaluable. His friendship will be sorely missed. Our sympathy is extended to his wife, Joan, and to his family. The Board of Trustees and Staff The New York Institute for Special Education
