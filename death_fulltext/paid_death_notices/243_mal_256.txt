        FEINBERG--Sidney. The law firm of Lazarus & Harris mourns the passing of our dear friend, mentor and partner, Sidney Feinberg. Sidney was an extraordinary entertainment lawyer, adored by his clients. He was truly one of a kind -razor sharp, a witty raconteur, elegant and a complete class act. Most of all, Sidney was extremely generous, kind and loyal to his friends and colleagues. Sidney is irreplaceable and will be terribly missed.
