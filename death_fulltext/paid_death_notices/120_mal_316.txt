        WEINBERG-Dr. Werner. The President, Chancellor, Boards of Governors and Overseers, faculty, administration and students of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion record with profound sorrow the death of Dr. Werner Weinberg. Professor Emeritus of Hebrew Language and Literature, Dr. Weinberg served with distinction on the Cincinnati Campus for over three decades. He was widely regarded as a scholar of Hebrew orthography and an author of books on Hebrew literature, medieval Hebrew poetry and Moses Mendelssohn. A survivor of Bergen-Belsen an author of Self-Portrait of a Holocaust Survivor, Dr. Weinberg dedicated his life to bear witness to the Holocaust and to the education of generations of rabbinic and graduate students at HUC-JIR. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his daughter, Mrs. Susie Konicov and family whose loss we deeply share. May his memory be for a blessing. Rabbi Sheldon Zimmerman, President Burton Lehman, Chairman, Board of Governors
