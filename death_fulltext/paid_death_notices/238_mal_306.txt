        McFERRIN--Robert. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of baritone Robert McFerrin, Sr., the first AfricanAmerican man to sing principal roles with our company. His landmark debut on January 27th, 1955 as Amonasro in ''Aida'' followed Marian Anderson's historic debut by only three weeks, and he went on to sing the title role of Rigoletto and Valentin in ''Faust'' at the Met. We offer our sincerest condolences to his family, friends and admirers.
