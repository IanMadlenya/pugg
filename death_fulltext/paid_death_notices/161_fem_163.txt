        NICKERSON-Virginia Moffat. It is with great sadness that the Trustees, staff, and volunteers of The Children's Aid Society acknowledge the loss of its Trustee. A long-time member of the Society's board, Virginia Nickerson chaired the 1200 member Volunteer committee. In 1997 she was singled out by the Office of the Mayor as the Volunteer of the Year for New York City. We will miss her warmth and humor and the impact she has made on all of our lives, young and old. To her beloved husband, Adams, her children, Douglas, Emily, and William Bateson, and Rosina Bateson Barker; to her grandchildren, Maria Bateson, Hoyt Bateson, Farrar Cooper, Nathaniel Cooper, Taylor Barker and Eleanor Barker, and to her brother, Keith Moffat, we send our sympathy and condolences. Services will be held at 11 AM, Wednesday, June 21 at St. John's Episcopal Church in Cold Spring Harbor, L.I. In lieu of flowers the family has asked that contributions be sent to The Children's Aid Society, 105 E. 22 St., NY, NY 10010. Edgar Koerner, Chairman Philip Colpoff, Executive Director
