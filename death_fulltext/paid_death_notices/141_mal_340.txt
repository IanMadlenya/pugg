        DANIEL-Louis. The staff of The House of Burgundy is greatly saddened by the death of Louis Daniel, who was revered by all who knew him as a warm and gentle man. He will be sorely missed by the wine and restaurant community. We remember Louis with great affection, and I personally have lost a treasured friend. Our deepest sympathies to his wife, Margaret.
