        LIEBERMAN-Minnie. The Yeshiva University family mourns the passing of a dear friend, a highly respected member of the Jewish community, and member of a family associated with the University's growth for some four decades. She and her late husband, Hyman, brothers Leon A. Miller and the late Ira I. Miller, and other family members established YU's Andrew N. and Rose Miller Chair in the History of Zionism and Modern Israel in memory of their parents, initial Founders of our Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Leon Miller is a member of the YU High Schools Board with his wife, Gloria Wang Miller, who is honorary board chairperson. Roselyn and the late Ira Miller are YU Guardians. We extend our heartfelt condolences to the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University David S. Gottesman, Chairman Board of Trustees
