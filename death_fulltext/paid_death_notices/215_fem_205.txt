        HERSCHER--Sylvia. A wise old man once told me that the only thing you take with you when you leave is what you gave away. Sylvia gave 65 years of thoughtful loving friendship, aiding, guiding wisdom to tell me to enjoy life to its fullest. She brought out the best in all of us. At the drop of a hat she said ''I'll make a party for us''. Our deepest condolences to Miriam, David, Elaine, Michael and Sam. Anna, Seymour, Norman, Ben Bloom
