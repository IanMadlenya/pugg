        BROCKWAY--Richard C. Mutual of America and its Board of Directors, together with all of its officers and employees, mourn the passing of our former President, Richard C. Brockway. Mr. Brockway, a graduate of the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, was born on February 18, 1908 in Rochester, New York. Prior to joining the Company as its President in 1966, he was the Executive Director of the Massachusetts Hospital Service (Blue Cross). Mr. Brockway was a beloved friend who guided the Company through changes that prepared it to become a larger and more competitive Company. Upon his retirement in 1971, the Board of Directors expressed its appreciation for his wise leadership during a period of unusual growth and challenge. He will always be remembered for his eloquence and for his passionate commitment to our mission. We will miss him greatly. Our sincere condolences to his daughters, Carla and Joanna. Thomas J.
