        DERBY-Bennett Marsh, M.D. The Faculty and Staff of New York University Medical Center deeply mourns the loss of our esteemed colleague, Bennett Marsh Derby, M.D., Professor of Clinical Neurology and Clinical Pathology at NYU School of Medicine. Dr. Derby had been a Faculty Member in The Dept of Neurology at NYU School of Medicine since 1965. He was a superb teacher, an active and effective clinician, and a productive investigator who made numerous contributions to the literature on neurological deseases and neuropathology. After attending Hamilton College, Dr. Derby earned his M.D. degree from The University of Virginia School of Medicine in 1956. He became Professor of Clinical Neurology at NYU School of Medicine in 1971 and Professor of Clinical Pathology in 1981. He also served as Chief of Neurology at The Veterans Administration Hospital. In addition to his hospital activities, he was a Consulting Neuropathologist to the Medical Examiner of The City of New York and to The State of Maine. Dr. Derby was a person of the highest degree of personal integrity whose intellect, imagination and leadership will be sorely missed. We extend our sympathies to his wife, Susan, and all the members of the Derby family. Edwin H. Kolodny, M.D., Chairman, Dept of Neurology NYU School of Medicine
