We convey our deepest condolences to his wife Kathy and children; Fred drew strength and courage from all of you, giving him the energy and peace to carry on the busy life he did. Despite many obligations, his door and heart were always open to all families, wealthy and poor. He lived kindness and charity every day.The Brd of Directors, Making Headway Foundation Chappaqua, NY

I feel personally fortunate to have been able to work alongside Fred for eight years at the INN, to take part in his dream to create a more healing hospital environment for children.
