        SMYTHE--Sheila Mary. Mutual of America, its Board of Directors together with all of its officers and employees mourn the passing of Sheila M. Smythe, an esteemed member of our Board of Directors. Sheila Smythe served on Mutual of America's Board since April 1991, participating on the Audit, Investment, Long-Range Planning and Nominating Committees. During her tenure as a director, she contributed to the decisions that led to the Company's growth and current position of financial strength. She always remained focused on the importance of Mutual of America's mission to serve the retirement needs of small employers in both the not-forprofit and for-profit worlds. Ms. Smythe's work as an educator and a public health administrator, including as president and CEO of Empire BlueCross BlueShield and as the chief health policy advisor to the U.S. General Accounting Office, significantly improved the quality and delivery of health care in this country. Her successful establishment of the Graduate School of Health Sciences of New York Medical College is further testament to Ms. Smythe's accomplishments. Her service on the boards of numerous charitable and educational organizations further exemplifies her dedication to public service, which was appropriately recognized by Manhattanville College when they established the Sheila Mary Smythe Award in 1997. Her sudden death leaves a void in our hearts. We will miss Ms. Smythe's professional insights as well as her warmth and friendship. Our sincere condolences to her niece, Sheila P. Gonley, and to her many friends and loved ones. William J. Flynn Chairman of the Board Thomas J. Moran President & CEO Mutual of America Life Insurance Company
