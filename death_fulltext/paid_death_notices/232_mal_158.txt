        FEUER--Cy. The members, board and staff of the League of American Theatres and Producers mourn our immediate past Chairman and longtime President, a remarkable man of the Theatre who, with Ernie Martin, produced an unprecedented series of hit shows including ''Guys and Dolls'' and ''Little Me.'' A director and a musician as well as a producer, Cy was a showman of impeccable taste, and a true legend in his field. An inspiring leader and vociferous advocate for Broadway, he taught us by example how to succeed in the theatre. Our thoughts are with his sons Jed and Bob, and their families.
        $(6$)FEUER--Cy. On behalf of all of his friends and neighbors, I extend my most deepest and heartfelt sympathies to the friends and family of Cy Feuer. He was a wonderful person, a true gentleman and a delightful neighbor and he will be sadly missed. Martin S. Berger, President Board of Directors 630 Park Avenue
