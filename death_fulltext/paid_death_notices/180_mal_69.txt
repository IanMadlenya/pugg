        DOWNES-Edward O.D. The faculty, alumni and students of the Aaron Copland School of Music at Queens College express their sorrow over the passing of Edward O. D. Downes, a member of our faculty from 1966 to 1983. Musicologist, critic, ambassador for opera and the symphonic repertoire, he was a man of extraordinary learning and culture and lent special distinction to the music program at Queens College. His family has suggested that contributions in his honor be made to the Edward Downes Scholarship Endowment, established at his retirement by the Aaron Copland School of Music (Queens College, Flushing, New York 11367).
