        PERKINS-Richard S. The Chapin School community is deeply saddened by the death of Richard S. Perkins. A member of the Board of Trustees for over 18 years, he served the school with great distinction, first as treasurer of the Board, and then as its president from 1960-1969. We extend our sympathy to his wife, Audrey W. Perkins, and to his entire family. Ella M. Foshay President of the Board of Trustees Sandra J. Theunick Head of School
