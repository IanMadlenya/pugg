        THORNE--Dorothy F. The Board and staff of The New York Botanical Garden are saddened by the death of Dorothy (''Dossie'') Thorne, who served on the Garden's Board from 1973-1992 and as an Honorary Board member since 1992. She was the wife of our late Board member, Oakleigh L. Thorne, and stepmother of our esteemed Board member and Vice Chairman, Honore Wamsler. Dossie's long standing and enthusiastic support of the Garden's horticulture programs typifies her commitment to the Garden and her many contributions to the cultural life of New York City. We extend our heartfelt condolences to her children, John Akin, Gwen Akin and Alison Akin Righter, and to her entire family. Wilson Nolen, Chairman Thomas J. Hubbard, Chairman Emeritus Gregory Long, President
