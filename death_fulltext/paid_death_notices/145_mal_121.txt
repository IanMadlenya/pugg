        FROSCH-John, M.D. The faculty and staff of The Department of Psychiatry mourn the loss of one of our distinguished faculty, Dr. John Frosch, Professor of Psychiatry at New York University School of Medicine. Dr. Frosch had a long association with the school spanning some 50 years. He was recognized for his observations of borderline patients, on disorders of impulse control and on the nature of violent behavior. He was instrumental in developing many of the teaching programs which have now become an integral part of the undergraduate and graduate psychiatric training program at NYU and was actively involved in the organization and the running of the residency training program for many years. He helped to found and was, from its inception, Editor-in-Chief of the publication of the American Psychoanalytic Association, a position he held for some 25 years. He also established the ''Annual Survey of Psychoanalysts'', of which he was the Editor for many years. We extend our deepest sympathy to his entire family. Robert M. Glickman, M.D. Dean, NYU School of Medicine Robert Cancro, M.D. Lucius N. Littauer, Professor and Chairman, Department of Psychiatry NYU School of Medicine
