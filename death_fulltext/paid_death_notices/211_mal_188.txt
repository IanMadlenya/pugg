        HECHT--Alan. On August 20, 2004. The HAFTR community is deeply saddened by the passing of our beloved ''Al Hecht'' devoted teacher, special friend and mentor to generations of our children, faculty and parent body. His passion, integrity and dedication since the founding of our school, will never be forgotten. May the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
