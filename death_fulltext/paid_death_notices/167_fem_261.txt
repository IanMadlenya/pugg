        SCHAEFFER-Kate. The members of the Art Dealers Association of America mourn the passing of their distinguished colleague who, with her late husband Hanns, dealt in works by Old Masters for more than 60 years. Works sold by The Schaeffer Gallery hang in many museums throughout the world. The combination of her charm and knowledge graced the art community. Our condolences to her daughter and son-in-law, Cornelia and Michael Bessie. Richard Gray, President Gilbert S. Edelson, Admin VP
