        KRONES--Robert. We are deeply saddened by the passing of our good friend and Director Emeritus Robert ''Bob'' Krones. Bob began his Greenwich House affiliation as a member of the Music School Advisory Board on which he served tirelessly for 25 years. His dedication to the organization led to his election to the Board of Directors where he served for 17 years, providing invaluable counsel, leadership and support in numerous ways. We extend our sincere condolences to his brother Ed, family and friends. George A. Davidson, Chair Board of Directors Roy Leavitt, Executive Director & CEO Greenwich House, Inc. BC Vermeersch, Director Greenwich House Music School
