        RUANE -- William J. (1925-2005). Save the Children's Board of Trustees, senior management team and staff in the United States mourn the passing of William J. Ruane, on October 7, 2005. In addition to being one of the most successful business leaders of his generation, Bill was one of Save the Children's most generous, valued and visionary supporters. He conducted his humanitarianism and philanthropy with characteristic modesty and privacy. Children living in remote rural communities in the United States--from Appalachia to the Mississippi Delta to Native American Reservations and California's Central Valley--have stateof-the-art literacy education and learning materials, thanks to Bill. Save the Children and the children we serve have lost a good friend and we extend our deepest condolences to Bill's wife Joy, his sons William Jr. and Thomas, his daughters Elizabeth and Paige, his sister Patricia Lowry, his four granddaughters, and his colleagues at Ruane, Cunniff and Goldfarb.
