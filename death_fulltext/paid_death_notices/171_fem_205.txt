        HARVEY-Clara. Died April 20, 2001. Loved by daughters Lisa and Cynthia, sisters Ethel and Juanita, grandson Conal and nieces and nephews. Mrs. Harvey gave so much of herself to her daughters. Born in Mexico, she resided in California (where she married Gordon Harvey-the marriage ended in 1973) until daughter Cynthia joined American Ballet Theatre in 1974, when she moved to New York. In New York, she worked for Manufacturers' Hanover Trust in the Leasing Department. In 1994, she returned to California, this time living closer to daughter Lisa. In Los Angeles, she began a shortlived career as an actress doing several commercials for Hispanic television in particular, including ads for Miller Lite Beer, Cigna Health Insurance and Southwest airlines to name but a few. Clara moved back to New York in early 2000 and after a period of ill health, succumbed to pneumonia. There will not be a viewing. Mass to be held Wednesday April 25 at 10AM at St. Elizabeths' Church-187th Street off St. Nicholas Avenue, Washington Heights. Her love of the music and dance, her tenacity and intelligence and especially her beautiful brown eyes, will be a memory everlasting.
