        SULLIVAN-Thomas A. The Board and staff of Lenox Hill Neighborhood House mourn the untimely death of our friend and benefactor. His death is a loss to all of us who had contact with this vital, erudite and compassionate man. Recipient of our 2001 Rohatyn Community Service Award, he embodied philanthropy at its finest: he wanted no glory, only quietly to help those who needed it most. Diana R. Quasha, President Nancy Wackstein, Exec. Director
