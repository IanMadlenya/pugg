        WYNN-Larry, born Lester Litwin in Brooklyn, New York, died on September 28, 1999 at Englewood Hospital, in New Jersey. Following the Crash of 1929, a stockbroker named Thomas R. Cox volunteered to pay for his college education. After three years at William and Mary, he transferred to Washington & Lee, graduating in 1934. Wynn played semi-professional basketball and softball before he got a job writing songs and singing for a live radio show. He sang with Dinah Shore and played gigs with the well-known Palmer Brothers as Larry Wynn and the Wynners. But it was a session with Billie Holiday (she recorded one of his songs, ''I'm All For You'') that inspired his biggest hit. In 1940, saxophonist Louis Jordan recorded ''Five Guys Named Moe,'' and the song was popular for a number of years, fading until producer Cameron Mackintosh borrowed the title for a musical. Five Guys Named Moe bowed on Broadway in April 1992 and was nominated for two Tony Awards, including Best Musical. The show continues to play to audiences worldwide. Wynn also enjoyed a sucessful career as a salesman in radio and television. He married Evelyn Dawson in 1959. They remainedtogether until her death in 1990. Wynn wrote a weekly well-known column for the New Jersey Bergen Times, until his death. He is survived by a nephew, Edmund Dawson of Hawthorne, New Jersey and Mr. Dawson's daughters, Susan, Wendy and Lisa.
