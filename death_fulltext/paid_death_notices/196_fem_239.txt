        SADOSKY--Sylvia. A most determined and sharp witted 91 year old perfectionist whose most perfect life's work is her fabulous daughter, Adele Frischling, of whom she was so justly very proud. Delly and Cuppy, Billy and Amy, Jimmy and Teddy, and Robert and Elizabeth were her greatest sources of pride and happiness for good reason. To our dear friend Delly, your lifetime of kindness and devotion to your mother sets an unsurpassable standard for children everywhere. Love, Audrey, Harvey, Eric and Mark Feuerstein >>AD#
