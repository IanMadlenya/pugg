        THORPE--Harvey. The entire Monroe College Community joins me in mourning the passing of Harvey Thorpe, a professor in the Computer Information Systems department for the past 24 years. Harvey was a wonderful and enthusiastic instructor who was much loved by his students. He will be missed by all of us and, most especially, by the students whose lives he changed for the better.
