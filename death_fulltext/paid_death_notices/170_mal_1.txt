        ARPIN-Gerard ''Todd''. Our magnificent, beloved friend died February 26, 2001, age 52, of Cancer. A great artist, Todd was extraordinarily skilled in many forms of painting, and his work enhanced and beautified many city and country homes. Many of his clients became his close friends. He loved life, laughed much and made the world a much better and more beautiful place. We extend our deepest sympathy to his dear friend and companion, Brando. Bob and Marie Saxe
