        BODENHEIMER--Julia. We mourn the passing of our cherished, devoted and longtime friend, Mrs. Julia Bodenheimer. For more than half a century she and her late husband, Dr. William Bodenheimer, maintained a close and special relationship with Shaare Zedek. A profoundly affectionate and considerate woman, she was always thrilled to hear about the continuing achievements of our Woman and Infant Center. May her family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. American Committee for Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem
