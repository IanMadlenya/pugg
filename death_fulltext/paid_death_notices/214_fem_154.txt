        BARRY--Kim, died tragically on November 20, 2004. Kim was a Fellow during 1997-1998 in the Arthur Garfield Hays Civil Liberties Program of New York University School of Law. She was an especially gifted student and performed her duties in the Hays Program with great distinction and extraordinary generosity. It is sad beyond words that Kim cannot continue her altruistic and loving life as a public interest lawyer. We shall never forget her. Norman Dorsen Sylvia A.
