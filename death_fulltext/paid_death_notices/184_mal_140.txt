        KUNOFSKY-Arthur M. Of New York, New York, on May 10, 2002, at age 64. Beloved husband of Rita Robbins Kunofsky, son of Helen Kunofsky and the late Herman Kunofsky, father of Glen and Harris Kunofsky, and sister of Shirley Vituli. His dear nieces and nephews, and dozens of other family members and friends also survive him.

Arthur's renowned sense of humor and ability to enjoy the simplest pleasures in life, even throughout his illness, made the world a better place. We will all miss him terribly. May he rest in peace. Arthur was raised in Brooklyn, and served as the Principal of IS 180, in the Bronx, until 1990. Funeral service at 9:30 AM, Sunday, May 12th at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue.
