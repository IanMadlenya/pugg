        CHAMBERLAIN-Ralph E. The extended Bassett Healthcare family joins us in mourning the loss of our esteemed trustee and benefactor Ralph E. Chamberlain. As president of the Friends of Bassett and later as chairman of Bassett's first capital campaign, Ralph helped establish an enduring philanthropic tradition, cultivated from years of experience as a distinguished fund-raising executive. A consummate gentleman, he used his considerable oratorical and persuasive abilities to advocate Bassett's mission of accessible, quality health care at every opportunity. Ralph backed up his words with personal commitment, donating generously to support many projects. We acknowledge our profound indebtedness to our beloved friend and neighbor. Our heartfelt condolences are extended to his wife Ellen and to each member of his family. William F. Streck, M.D. President and Chief Executive Officer Thomas Q. Morris, M.D. Chairman of the Board of Trustees Bassett Healthcare Cooperstown, New York
