        CHAZEN--Frank. Everyone at Day & Meyer Murray & Young Corp is deeply saddened by the loss of our dear friend and colleague, Frank Chazen. An invaluable employee for more than 15 years, Frank was a tireless worker who was both loyal to the Company and fair to everyone. Frank loved the moving and storage industry, and the industry loved him in return. With his rare combination of compassion and a wicked sense of humor, he had more friends than he could count. He was also a proud father, devoted to his daughter Rebecca and his wife Maria. To them, and to the rest of his family, we extend our deepest sympathies.
