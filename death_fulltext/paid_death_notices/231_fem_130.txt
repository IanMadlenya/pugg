        FISKE--Alice H. Of Sylvester Manor, Shelter Island, NY, on April 17, at age 88. The beloved wife of the late Andrew Fiske, the 13th-generation descendant of Nathaniel Sylvester, who settled Shelter Island in 1652. She helped restore Sylvester Manor and its gardens to their 19th century glory. As the founder of the Andrew Fiske Memorial Center for Archeological Research at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, she sponsored archeological ''digs'' at Sylvester Manor. She was a supporter of many East End organizations, among which were the Shelter Island Library, Shelter Island Historical Society, and the Shelter Island Garden Club. She is survived by her daughters, Susan Woodworth of Summit, NJ, and Elisabeth Williamson of Severna Park, MD, four grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren. In lieu of flowers, kindly send donations in her memory to the Shelter Island Library, PO Box 2016, Shelter Island, NY 11964, or to the Shelter Island Historical Society, Havens House, PO Box 847, Shelter Island, NY 11964. A memorial service will be scheduled later in the Spring.
