        GRONNINGSATER - Arne. The Trustees, faculty and administration of Riverdale Country School regret the passing on August 30, of Arne Gronningsater, teacher and friend to generations of students. Our deepest sympathies go to his children, Arne, Howell, Alan, Kari and Annie. An English teacher, he came to the School in 1951, remained until 1978 and returned to teach part time from 1980 to 1987. A founder of the ILS (integrated liberal studies) Program, he trained young minds to think critically. Memorial Service at All Souls Church, New York City, on Saturday, September 23 at 12:00 Noon.
