        LIND-Meri. Beloved sister, aunt, great-aunt, friend and mentor, died in peace at Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center. Born in Moscow in 1918, she lived in Berlin and Paris before immigrating to New York in 1938. Following her father's deportation to Auschwitz, she was the driving force in bringing her mother and sister to the United States in 1947. She loved all things beautiful: nature, art, theater, music and dance. Once a professional dancer, she received an MFA from Queens College. She translated the fluid beauty of the body into insights about character, creating a vision called Imageology. Knowing how important self-image can be, especially for those struggling with cancer, she pushed tirelessly for increased use of creative and alternative therapies, especially dance, music and art therapies, to enhance the quality of patients' lives, even as she herself was battling debilitating illness. She was well ahead of her time in recognizing the value of these creative therapies in helping patients. Surviving her are her beloved sister Vera Stern, her six nephews and nieces by birth and marriage, her five great-nephews and great-nieces, and her many friends and students. Both she and her family are grateful to Patricia and Precilla, and all the doctors, nurses and staff on the 12th floor of Memorial Hospital. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Integrative Medicine (1246 2nd Ave, NYC 10021; attn: Dr. J. Holland), where she made her mark and was so well treated. Services will be held this Sunday at Plaza Memorial Chapel, 630 Amsterdam Avenue at 91st Street, at 2 PM.
        LIND-Meri. The Board of Directors and staff of America-Israel Cultural Foundation extend our deepest condolences & sympathy to our President, Vera Stern, & her family on the passing of her sister.
