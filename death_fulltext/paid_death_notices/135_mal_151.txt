        DRAGUTSKY-David, M.D. It is with the deepest sense of loss for a highly recognized and devoted pediatrician that the Department of Pediatrics at Maimonides Medical Center acknowledges the passing of David Dragutsky, M.D. Dr. Dragutsky served as staff and consulting pediatrician and specialist in newborn care at Maimonides Medical Center for well over five decades. His devotion to patient care, clinical teaching and to the community served by Maimonides Medical Center was exemplary. He was a superb pediatrician for children here in Borough Park for his entire professional career. To his wife Lenore and his daughters, we in the Medical Center and in the Department of Pediatrics sadly mourn his loss and wish them strength and courage in these days without him. Steven P. Shelov, M.D., M.S. Chairman, Dept. of Pediatrics Maimonides Medical Center
