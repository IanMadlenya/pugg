        PATINKIN--Marsha. On behalf of the board of trustees, volunteers, and employees of the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America, we offer our heartfelt condolences to the family of Marsha Patinkin, a treasured member of CCFA's national board and President of our Greater San Diego and Desert Area Chapter. Throughout her life, Marsha fought a valiant battle against Crohn's disease. Although her illness took a severe physical and emotional toll, Marsha never wavered in her resolve to live a rich and productive life. Her dedication, warmth, and inner strength remain a powerful source of inspiration to all of us at CCFA. Marsha was the loving and caring daughter of Doris; the beloved mother of Leslie, Amanda, and Lainie; and the adored sister of Mandy. We extend our deepest sympathies to her family, and hope they will take comfort in the knowledge that her spirit lives on in the memories of the countless people whose lives she touched. Mark Goldman, Chairperson of the Board Eugene A. Kestenbaum, Immediate Past Chairperson Lisa H. Richardson, Chairperson of the Board Emeritus Rodger L. DeRose, President and CEO Irwin M. and Suzanne Rosenthal, William D. and Shelby Modell, and Henry D. Janowitz, M.D., National Co-founders.
