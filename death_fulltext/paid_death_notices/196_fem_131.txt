        MARCUS-Celine G. The Board and staff of the Neighborhood Coalition for Shelter deeply mourn the loss of our much-loved founder, past president, mentor and friend. Celine devoted her life to identifying solutions to the problems facing the homeless, children, senior citizens and the poor in our community with an extraordinary sense of humor, exceptional skill and tireless dedication. The many organizations she helped create on the Upper East Side, including ours, are a testament to Celine's boundless energy and activism. We will always miss her good humor, her incisiveness, her good common sense and most of all, her friendship. Our deepest sympathies go out to her children Ann, Daniel and Dorothea and their families. Stephanie Guest, Board President Anne R. Teicher, Executive Director
