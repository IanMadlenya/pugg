        BARAGWANATH--Albert K. The Board of Trustees and staff of the Museum of the City of New York note with deep sadness the passing of Albert K. Baragwanath, Senior Curator Emeritus. On staff from 1952 to 1980, he provided a model for his successors. We extend our sympathies to his family and friends. Newton P.S. Merrill, Chairman Susan Henshaw Jones, President and Director
