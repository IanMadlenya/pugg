        HANKIN-Leonard J. Honorary Trustee. The Officers, Trustees and staff of the Educational Alliance note with profound sadness the passing of Leonard J. Hankin, our Honorary Trustee and friend. Leonard joined the Alliance's Board of Trustees in 1957 and served as an officer and Chair of the Nominating Committee for many years. He was a wise, gentle, compassionate and caring human being. Always elegant in the clarity of his thinking and his style, Leonard's intelligence, integrity and vision were major sources of the Alliance's strength. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Leonard's loving family.
