        HECKELMAN-Rabbi A. Joseph. We record with profound sadness the passing of our beloved colleague. After ordination he made aliyah and became the founding rabbi of the Conservative/Masorti community in Safed, a position he held until his death and also served as president of the Rabbinical Assembly in Israel. He was a pioneer on behalf of our movement in Israel and dedicated his life to our rabbis and our movement there. We express our deepest condolences to his wife, Tzipora, children, Joshua and Sara and to all who were touched through his rabbinate. Rabbi Vernon H. Kurtz, President Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Executive Vice President The Rabbinical Assembly
