        BERMAN--Lazar. The House of Steinway & Sons notes with profound sadness the passing of the eminent Russian pianist Lazar Berman on February 6 in Florence, Italy at the age of 74. A valued member of our Steinway Artist family for thirty years, Mr. Berman will be widely remembered as one of the romantic virtuosos of the twentieth century. He was warmly received as a participating artist in Steinway & Sons' 135th anniversary celebration concert at Carnegie Hall on June 2, 1988. A significant discography will keep alive the legacy of this important artist for future generations. To his family we extend our heartfelt condolences. Bruce A. Stevens, President Peter B. Goodrich, V.P., Worldwide Concert and Artist Activities
