        KAISER-Richard. The entire Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center community joins together in mourning the passing of our dear friend Richard Kaiser. Dean Herbert Pardes acknowledges with gratitude Mr. Kaiser's dedication to the advancement of quality medical care and academic research. Mr. Kaiser will long be remembered for his interest in and commitment to cardiology research at Columbia. His devotion to our faculty and to science was inspiring and led to his thoughtful and enthusiastic participation in many of our programs including regular seminars led by Dr. Allan Schwartz, assistance in the establishment of the Kenneth Forde Professorship in Surgery and the founding of the Richard and Lynne Kaiser Family Foundation Molecular Cardiology Laboratory. We will miss his friendship, foresight, advice and humor. We join together in expressing our tremendous sorrow to his wife, Lynne, their children Joseph, Charlotte, Martha & Henry & the entire Kaiser family.
