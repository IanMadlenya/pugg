        LEVINE-Samuel. On December 24, concluding 94 years of loving concern for those who touched and were touched by him. Adoring husband of the late Della, dear devoted father of Marjorie Hirsch, forever inscribed in the hearts of his many nieces and nephews of the Levine family, of which he was the last of the elders. Loving mentor to nephew Steven Friedman and cherished by his sistersin-law Evelyn Rosenzweig and Ann Levine. Dear friend of Ethel Aber. He was an early ''son'' of B'nai Zion. Deeply respected throughout the floorcovering industry in which he worked for 74 years, he never wavered in his sense or responsibility, enthusiasm and grace. We'll miss you, dearest Daddy, Sammy, but your spirit lives on in each of us. Services Sunday, December 28, 12 noon at Riverside, 76th Street and Amsterdam Ave.
