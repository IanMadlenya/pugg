        MERKIN-Hermann. The American Friends of Tel Aviv University mourn the passing of our esteemed friend. Hermann Merkin was truly a legendary figure at Tel Aviv University. A wise man of great compassion, his vision and generosity enabled our University to establish the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies and the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies. He was a very gentle man of infinite grace and humility. Our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Ursula, and his family. The American Friends of Tel Aviv University Alan L.
