        HALL--Evelyn. The Boards of Overseers and Managers and staff of Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center mourn the death of Evelyn A.J. Hall. Over many years, Mrs. Hall was a stalwart supporter of the Center, primarily concerned that patients be able to receive the most sophisticated, most effective cancer care in comfortable settings to minimize the impact of treatment on their lives. Her generous contributions supported the Brachytherapy Suite and Adult Day Hospital both of which, at their inceptions, represented innovative ways of delivering cancer care. In addition, Mrs. Hall supported the PET (positron emission tomography) program, long-term follow-up studies of pediatric patients, the Clinical Genetics Service, the Patient Free Care Fund, and other Center programs. She also brightened the lives of Memorial Hospital's pediatric patients with her support of The Big Apple Circus Clown Care Unit. Mrs. Hall's forward-looking altruism, energy, imagination, and frienship will be deeply missed. Douglas A. Warner III Chairman, Boards of Overseers and Managers Richard I. Beattie, Vice Chairman Harold Varmus, President John R. Gunn, Executive Vice President Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
