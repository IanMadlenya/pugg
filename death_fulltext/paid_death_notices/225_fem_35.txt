        JOHNSON--Rosie Blake The friends of Rosie Blake Johnson (October 6th 1941February 6th 2005) wish to express their deep sorrow at the passing of one of such magnetic grace. She had become central to our lives, awakening us to wonders which by ourselves we would neither have envisioned nor sought. A graduate of Radcliffe College in the early sixties, her image was soon on the cover of Mademoiselle magazine. She became an Avedon model and appeared briefly in films, one of Woody Allen's with the Peters: Sellers and O'Toole: ''What's New Pussycat''. In her hilarious sketch of her own life up to that point: ''Made In Heaven'', Little Brown, '71, she described her emergence from New England schooling into the drift lanes of the young and bright from Paris to Marrakesh. Brilliant beyond her time, with her quick ironic wit and natural sense of style, she epitomized that era's exploding pace. She lived for many years in Cambridge, MA, wrote and taught English and charmed flocks of friends there and also in London, Prague, Madrid, and Rockland, ME. In her last year, beset with debilitating cancer, and without complaint, her magical friendships and vital pace unchanged, she exhibited extraordinary courage, leaving life without fear. We remain awed, and ever thankful for the life she chose to share with us.
