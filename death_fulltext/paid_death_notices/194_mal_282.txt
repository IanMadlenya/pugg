        HOROWITZ-Richard B. Born July 13, 1941, died March 20, 2003. He is survived by his beloved wife, Suzanne. Rick was a manufacturers representative in the toy industry for 30 years. To say that Rick loved New York would be an understatement. He was New York. His gorgeous sense of grace and style is the very essence of the town he loved and proudly called home. His generosity was never-ending. His positive attitude never exhausted. His love of life, childen and fun times made him the perfect (Toyman), as all his friends and family well know-and who could ever forget that smile. He will be greatly missed. So here's to you Rick-you did it your way. No one can take that away from you. But most important of all, we'll always love you, come rain, come shine. Rick is also survived by his loving sister, Sandra Horowitz of Margate, FL, his special and devoted mother-inlaw, Marjorieann Enderson of Ogdensberg, NJ and all of his six loving sisters and brothers-in-law. A celebration of Rick's life is planned for Saturday, July 12, at their home in Quogue, Long Island, NY. Contributions in Rick's memory may be made to ALS Force, P.O. Box 271, Loma Linda, CA. 92354.
