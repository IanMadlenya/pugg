        CLEARY-Malachy F. On behalf of the Saint David's community, we celebrate with pride the life of Malachy Cleary who served the school for 31 years with dedication and integrity. He was patriarchal, full of life, and scholarly. Mr. Cleary will be remembered fondly by generations of Saint David's boys. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his family.
