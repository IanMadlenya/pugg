        EDISON--Edna Leah. 86. A longtime resident of New York, she was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia and died peacefully in New York on October 20, after a short illness. She was a talented and aspiring actress, and attended Bennington College until an early illness interrupted her formal education. For a while she lived in Paris. Besides acting, her interests also ran to writing, where her wit and imagination gained expression. A particularly favorite author was Katherine Ann Porter, and she adapted into play form that author's story, ''Spring Wine.'' Ms. Edison was the daughter of Hannah Farbstein Edison and Harry Edison. Her father founded Edison Brothers Stores, an enterprise in which he was joined by his four brothers. It began as a single shoe store in Atlanta and grew nationally to become the largest chain of women's shoe stores in the country. As the business grew, Ms. Edison moved with her family to St. Louis, home of the Company's corporate headquarters. Edna will be missed and remembered often by her loving brother Sidney, her only sibling, also a resident of New York; her large and close family, and friends. No memorial service is planned. In lieu of flowers, those wishing to may consider a donation in her name to Columbia College of Physicians & Surgeons or to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York City, where Funds are being established in her name.
