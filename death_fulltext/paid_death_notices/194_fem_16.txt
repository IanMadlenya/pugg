        SKYDELL-Ruth. Died February 21, 2003. ''An honored name is more valued than pure oil.'' (Koheles chapter 7.1) With profound sorrow we mourn the loss of our most precious possession, Ruth Skydell. Wife, mother, grandmother, condfidante, counselor. A nobel woman of regal stature, she will forever be remembered for her countless acts of loving kindness, her all-embracing radiant smile, and her special combination of dignity, elegance, grace, wisdom, insight, empathy, selflessness, charm and humility. Mom nourished, sustained and uplifted us throughout our lives with her unconditional love, and acted as an outstanding role model for her family and many friends all her days. We will continue to carry her love in our hearts and pray that the Almighty will give us the guidance, strength and inspiration to follow the rich tradition of Torah, mitzvos and chesed of our beloved mother and her renowned righteous parents of blessed memory, Harry and Etta Herskowitz. May we bring everlasting honor to our mother's name and memory. Mom, we will always love you. Laurie, Myron, Buddy, Harry, Rachel, Jill, Eleanor, Heather, Warren, Joseph, Ephraim, Dena, Tamar, Shoshana, Yael
