        BRAISTED--Andrew Charles, PhD. Dr. Braisted died suddenly, on October 4, 2003, of suspected heart failure, leaving his wife Joelle Morrow, M.D. and their unborn son. Born in New York City in 1964, he resided for much of his adult life in San Francisco. He was a graduate of Bates College and the University of California at Berkeley, where he earned a doctorate degree in Organic Chemistry. After post-doctoral work in Protein Engineering at Genentech, Inc. he was a founder of Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. where he specialized in the discovery of small molecule drugs. He held several patents in the field, notably for tethering, Sunesis's core drug discovery technology. He is also survived by his parents, Gayl and Charles Braisted, and his sisters Christina Braisted Rogers and Melissa Braisted. Andrew will be remembered by all who have known him for his incredible dedication to everything he did. He was admired and loved so much; he was an inspiration, a leader, and a support for every individual and group he has touched. He was a passionate friend, husband, brother, and son; a patient teacher, a brilliant scientist, an extraordinary cook and SAAB enthusiast, and someone who has made us all feel lucky to have known him. He will be greatly missed. In lieu of flowers, you may make contributions to the Andrew Braisted Memorial Fund.
