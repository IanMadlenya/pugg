        COLZANI--Anselmo. The Metropolitan Opera deeply mourns the death of the distinguished baritone Anselmo Colzani, who sang nearly 300 performances of 18 roles at the Met between 1960 and 1978. He excelled in the Italian repertory, and shares the Met record for most performance as Jack Rance in ''La Fanciulla del West'' with the role's creator, Pasquale Amato, and was also heard in the title role of ''Falstaff'' in the premiere of the Zeffirelli production. He will be greatly missed and we extend our sincerest sympathy to his family. Joseph Volpe, Gen. Mgr. James Levine, Music Dir.
