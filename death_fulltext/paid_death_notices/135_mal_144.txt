        STEINER-Malcolm. For more than 30 years, Malcolm Steiner was a valued and devoted friend of Long Island Jewish Medical Center. His philanthropy extended from enthusiastic support when the hospital first opened its doors to generously giving his time to many programs. A welcome and familiar volunteer in the gift shop, along with his wife Betty, an Associate Trustee of the hospital, he spent countless hours helping patients, visitors and staff. He was a rare and admirable man and will be deeply missed. Our condolences to Betty and the entire Steiner family. Saul B. Katz, Chairman David R. Dantzker, MD John S. T. Gallagher, Co-Presidents and CEOs North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System
