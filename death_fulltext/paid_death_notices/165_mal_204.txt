        CANBY-Vincent. His passion for the movies, his sheer enjoyment of them and his championing of the independents made him a delight to work with. A man of integrity, humor and rigor. We owe him so much. Karen Cooper, Bruce Goldstein, Film Forum
        CANBY-Vincent. The ''Toxic Avenger'' and the Troma team will mourn the passing of Vincent Canby, a true supporter of independent cinema. He was a brilliant wordsmith, film historian and critic. His fairness and genius will be missed. Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz
