        FLANAGAN-Gene J. Dean of Continuing Education and Professor of Behavioral Sciences at Kingsboro Community College, The City University of New York. The administration, faculty, staff and students of Kingsboro Community College mourn the passing of a most valued colleague and friend on Friday, October 16. Dean Flanagan joined Kingsboro in 1977, directing the Continuing Education Program, where he introduced a number of programs including College for Kids, GED Preparation, English as a Second Language and Diploma Now. Before coming to Kingsboro, Dr. Flanagan was principal of the Sheepshead Bay Adult School. He was also active in a number of regional and national professional organizations in Adult and Continuing Education. His dedicated professionalism, skills and creativity were an inspiration to many members of the Kingsboro community. We offer our heartfelt condolences to his wife Kay and his family.
