        PRINCE-Elaine Corinne (Katzberg). Beloved wife and mother, quintessential New Yorker, retired at age 79, just two years ago. She spent a lifetime of rejoicing in New York's culture and atmosphere, going to the opera, visiting museums and possessing an encyclopedic knowledge of every great little store and cultural event in the City. Proud mother of son Dr. Stephen Elliot Katzberg and daughter Elizabeth Kennedy; grandmother to Melanie and Rachel; and step-grandmother to Sarah and Bridget. Her incredible insight, superlative advice, majestic dignity, and decisive intellect will be terribly missed.
