        GOLDMAN--Sam, 88, on March 1. A super-special husband, brother, father, grandfather and uncle. He leaves behind his beloved Shirley, his wife and best friend for 56 years, brother David, sister Goldie Miller (Stanley), children Ed (Judith Riven), Lisa Polito (Eddie) and Nina Kritter (Peter). He was always so proud of his four grandsons-Andrew, Peter, Dylan and Remy and our Sambo was a beloved Uncle Sam to his eight nephews. His warmth, generosity, leadership and expert guidance were always there for our entire family, and he was unfailing in his readiness to help all he came in contact with. During Sam's 60-plus years in the printing and bookbinding industries, his smile and helpful and sage counsel were a constant. Members of his profession and his employees respected Sam for his positive outlook, and his consistently thoughtful consideration. If you would like to make a tribute, please consider the Long Island Alzheimer's Foundation, 5 Channel Dr., Port Washington, NY 11050. Farewell, sweet mensch.
