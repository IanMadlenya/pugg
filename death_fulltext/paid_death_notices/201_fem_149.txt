        SCHNURER--Bernice Lunin. 79, was born in New York City and lived there for the first half of her life. A child of immigrants who died when she was young, Bernice became, in spite of her humble financial circumstances, an ardent patron of the arts, and for the remainder of her life avidly followed the NYC art and performing arts scenes. In 1957, she married Harold Schnurer, a former New York businessman and state commerce director. They moved to Arizona in 1961, with their two children, where she helped build Phoenix into the community it is today, including service as president of both the Opera League and Symphony Guild. She and her husband were also early and active supporters of civil rights, each serving as president of the Phoenix Urban League. Bernice also served for many years on the Board of the American Jewish Committee, and was a co-founder of Temple Solel. She is survived by son Eric, daughter Danielle Gold, grandson Ryan Harold Gold, and stepson Anthony T. Schnurer. She will be laid to rest beside her husband, Tuesday, October 28, at Mt. Carmel Cemetery, Glendale, NY.
