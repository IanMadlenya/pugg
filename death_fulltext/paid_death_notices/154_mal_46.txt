        GIBIAN-George. The Department of Russian Literature and the Russian Language Program at Cornell University are deeply saddened by the unexpected death, on October 24, 1999, of Goldwin Smith Professor of Russian and Comparative Literature George Gibian. He founded the Department and has been a beloved teacher and major scholarly presence for nearly fifty years, 38 at Cornell. He was teaching and writing until his death. We will miss our dear friend.
