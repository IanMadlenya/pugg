        LOPATIN-Harold. The Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Association Greater New York Chapter is deeply saddened by the loss of a good friend and long time supporter Harold Lopatin. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to his wife Ruth who, together with Harold, generously contributed much time and energy toward furthering ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease) research. Through their efforts we are closer to finding a cure. Board of Directors
