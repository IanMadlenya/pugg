        QUITTMAN-Herman Z. The National Officers, Board of Directors and the membership of American Red Magen David for Israel record with profound sorrow the passing of Herman Z. Quittman, one of the founders of our organization in 1941 and the first director. His wise counsel, integrity, benevolence and inspiration left an indelible imprint on all of us, as well as on the lifesaving work of MDA Magen David Adom - Israel's equivalent to a Red Cross Society. His noble spirit touched all who associated with him. We extend our sincere condolences to his bereaved family. Robert L. Sadoff, M.D., National President Benjamin Saxe, Exec. Vice Pres.
