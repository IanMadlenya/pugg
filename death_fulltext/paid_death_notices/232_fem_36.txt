        BLOOM--Ruth. The Board of Directors and staff of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation mourn the loss of our director Ruth Bloom, who for twenty-two years devoted considerable energy and intelligence to carrying out HHC's mission to provide high quality health care to all New Yorkers, regardless of ability to pay. We extend our deepest condolences to her family.
