        JOHNSON -- John Bouvier. The Paget Foundation for Paget's Disease of Bone and Related Disorders mourns the loss of our beloved founder and president who led the foundation from 1978 to his death on December 24, 2004. A remarkable leader whose commitment to the Foundation was passionate and unwavering, John was a constant source of ideas, encouragement and support. His visionary work on behalf of Paget's disease patients and physicians was ennobled by his profound humanism and unwavering determination to improve the plight of Paget's disease sufferers. In 2003, John wrote ''It was easy to start a foundation, but it took the genius and energy of a unique team to set it in motion. The alliance of visionary volunteers who have defined and carried forward the mission of the Paget Foundation has achieved successes against disabling bone diseases that far exceed my fondest hopes, yet still do not fulfill theirs.'' A memorial service will be held at Saugatuck Congregational Church, Westport, CT, 1:00PM on January 8th. The family requests contributions to the Paget Foundation, 120 Wall Street, Suite 1602, NY, NY 10005. Frederick R. Singer, M.D. Chairman, Board of Directors Charlene Waldman, Executive Director The Paget Foundation
