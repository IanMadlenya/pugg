        HEIFERMAN-Celia, (nee Friedman). It has been one sad and lonely year since the death of our beloved Mother, Grandmother and Great-Grandmother. She was a gentle and gallant lady who was admired by all who knew her and deeply loved by those lucky enough to have known her well. She left us a legacy of love and a lifetime of treasured memories of her warmth, wisdom and laughter. She is deeply missed by us, her family, and always will be.
