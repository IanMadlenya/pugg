        REISMAN-Simon (Cy). Of Miami Beach, at age 95, after a brief illness. Survived by his adoring wife of 70 years, Ethel; son, James, of New York City; and loving grandchildren, Adam and Leah. Cy will always be remembered as a pillar of strength for his family and a good friend to many who knew him since his graduation from City College in 1924, and during his long career with the New York City school system. He was a true gentleman, whose forthright personality will remain a beacon to his family and friends.
