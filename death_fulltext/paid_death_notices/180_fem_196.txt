The only child of Pierre Marcel Joseph Drouin and Betty Nevile Drouin, Margot spent her childhood in Morocco and France. She lived in St. Jean de Luz during the German occupation. After the war she studied at Oxford and the University of Geneva, where she earned a degree in translation. Margot moved to the U.S. in 1954 but maintained her French citizenship while living here most of her life. She came to the U.S. to work with the World Bank and eventually became an assistant to the designer Raymond Loewe in New York City. In 1956 she married Peter Michael Gish, an artist from Westport with whom she had three children; Charlotte, Peter and Carl (K). Margot travelled extensively and was a travel consultant in Greenwich for 25 years. She was very involved in the community and was a vice president and secretary for the Alliance Francaise and a 50-year volunteer with the Red Cross. Margot is survived by her husband, three children and grandchildren. An intelligent, beautiful woman of uncommon grace, she will be dearly missed by her family, many, many friends and acquaintances. A funeral mass will be held at St. Roch's Church in Greenwich on Monday, January 21st, at 11 AM.
