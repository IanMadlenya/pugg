        HOLLOWAY-Bruce. The New York Institute of Technology community records with profound sorrow the passing of General Bruce Holloway, American patriot and longtime member of the college's Board of Trustees. The epitome of courage and integrity, he will be sorely missed. Our deepest condolences are extended to his wife, daughters and his entire family.
