        KARSH-Yousuf. We mourn the passing of a dear friend and monumental force in photography, whose long distinguished career touched the lives of major figures of contemporary history. He will also be missed for his innate charm and keen insight. We extend our deep condolences to Estrellita, his wife and partner for many years. With profound thanks for his lasting images and memories, we bid him a fond farewell!! Cornell Capa, Fndng Director Willis Hartshorn, Director Int'l Center of Photography
