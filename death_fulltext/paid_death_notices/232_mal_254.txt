        GUTH--Bernard. The family of The Curtis Institute of Music mourns the loss of its devoted friend Bernard Guth and extends deepest sympathy to his family. He was a longtime and invaluable member of our Board of Trustees, combining business acumen with highly sophisticated musicianship. A gentleman of impeccable taste, wit, and an infectious zest for the good life, he was an excellent companion, as well as a committed advocate for maintaining the highest quality of artistic effort. We will always remember him with the greatest respect and love. Richard A. Doran, Chairman Gary Graffman, President/Director The Curtis Institute of Music
