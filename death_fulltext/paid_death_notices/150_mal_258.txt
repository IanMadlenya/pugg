        NGAI-Shih-Hsun, MD. The Federation of Chinese American and Chinese Canadian Medical Societies express sincere sympathy on the loss of a founding supporter. He was instrumental in the early development of the Federation and paved the way in medicine for Chinese Americans as leaders with his position as Chairman of the Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University of Medicine. We are in great sorrow.
