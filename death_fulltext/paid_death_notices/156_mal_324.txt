        STONE-Irving I. The Officers, Board and staff of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) mourn the passing of Irving I. Stone, its distinguished friend, former Board member and father of our current devoted Board member Judy Stone Weiss. He was an extraordinary man in his vision and generosity, concerned about all aspects of Jewish life, with a special interest in Jewish education. His wide-ranging interests extended from leadership in his local community in Cleveland, to responding to needs in Israel and Jews throughout the world. His devotion and breadth of spirit were an inspiration. He will be missed. Jonathan W. Kolker, President Michael Schneider Executive Vice President Ambassador Milton A. Wolf Chairman of the Board
