She is survived by Elliott, her best friend and husband of fiftyeight years; by her children, Steve, John and Tom; and by John's wife Ella Baff. Millie received her B.A. in languages from Hunter College, New York in 1938, and thirty-six years later earned her MA Degree in Counseling from Roosevelt University, Chicago. She became the Director of Admissions for the non-traditional School for New Learning of DePaul University, also in Chicago, retiring at sixtytwo in 1980. In 1979, with her husband, she was a co-founding member of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI). She was an active member of the Women's Strike for Peace, the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee (ECLC) and the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). As she wished, no formal funeral services will be held, but she will be well remembered by her devoted family and her many good friends. Contributions in her memory would be appreciated either to the California Alliance for the Mentally Ill (CAMI), 1111 Howe Avenue (Suite 475), Sacramento, California 95825, or to the Alameda County Mental Health Association (ACMHA), 1801 Adeline Street, Oakland, CA. 94607.
