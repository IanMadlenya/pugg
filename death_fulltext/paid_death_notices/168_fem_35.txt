        NAUTS-Helen Coley. The Board of Trustees, Scientific Advisory Council and Staff of the Cancer Research Institute grievously mourn the loss of the Institute's dearly beloved Founder, Helen Coley Nauts, D.Sc. (Hon). Mrs. Nauts was an exceptional woman whose vision and lifetime of dedication to the fight against cancer serves as an inspirational example of selfless heroism and humanitarianism. Her wisdom, pragmatism and years of guidance were indispensable in fostering the Institute from its humble beginnings to its present position as a pioneer in the field of cancer immunotherapy.
