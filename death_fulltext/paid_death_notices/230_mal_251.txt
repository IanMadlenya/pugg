        BEUTEL--William C. The Board of Trustees and Staff of the Wildlife Conservation Society are deeply saddened by the death of our friend, Bill Beutel. His professionalism and thoughtful approach to the news helped define television journalism in New York City for over three decades. The Society was fortunate to know Bill through his wife Adair, who has served on a number of committees since 1985 and most recently as an Advisor to the Marketing Committee. We extend our sympathies to Adair and the rest of the Beutel family. David T. Schiff, Chairman Board of Trustees Steven E. Sanderson, President and CEO $(6$)BEUTEL--Bill. The Officers, Governors and Members of the New York Friars Club deeply mourn the loss of their beloved member, Bill Beutel. He helped us preserve the rich theatrical roots of the Friars Club and his name belongs among the legendary and immortal Friars broadcasters such as Edward R. Murrow and like them, he shared a legacy of commitment to the very best. We are honored and proud to have been touched by this broadcast journalist and we extend our sincere condolences to his family. Freddie Roman, Dean Jean-Pierre Trebot Executive Director
