        LEFKOWITCH-Stanley L. Born May 18, 1917. Died New York City October 28, 1998. Husband of the late, beloved Clarice. Son of Henry and Sylvia. Survived by loving children Jay Lefkowitch, M.D., Shelley White, Amy Niles, Judith Abbott, Gregory Abbott, Dennis Abbott; sons and daughters-in-law Jeffrey Block and Barbara Abbott, David White and J. Herbert Niles, M.D.; grandchildren Mark, Lesley, Asa, Sam, Hannah; great grandchild Nathaniel. A graduate of City College of New York, he succeeded his father, Henry, as owner of Metro Music Company, 3rd Street and 2nd Avenue in New York City, which in its day was the largest publisher of Jewish music worldwide. A versatile musician, he played clarinet and saxophone and several other instruments, was an arranger and knew what it was to be a ''side man'' and orchestra contractor during and after World War II. For most of the past two decades, until his retirement at age 80 last year, he brought his considerable musical expertise, particularly in classical music, to the Sam Ash Corporation in Paramus, N.J. He derived great pleasure from volunteering at the Allen Pavilion of ColumbiaPresbyterian Medical Center after retirement. He adored playing tennis and played tournaments throughout Westchester County. He loved travelling with his wife, Clarice, and shared her abundant enthusiasm for the symphony, the theatre and ballet. Fascinated with all things mechanical and technical, he also painted in oils and acrylic and designed covers for many of Metro Music's sheet music publications. A gentle and loving man with a wonderfully wry wit, he will always be carried in our hearts. Memorial service on Sunday, November 1 at 12 noon, The Riverside Memorial Chapel, Amsterdam Avenue and 76th St., New York City (212-362-6600).
