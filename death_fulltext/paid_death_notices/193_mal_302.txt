        LANCHBERY-John. American Ballet Theatre mourns the passing of its former music director and colleague, John Lanchbery. A world-renowned conductor and arranger of music for ballets and film, Jack most notably arranged the Minkus score for ABT's La Bayadere in 1980. His career highlights included the musical arrangement for the film The Turning Point and the ballets The Merry Widow and La Fille mal gardee. We extend our deepest sympathies to his family and friends.
