        BRAUN--Melvin, January 1, 2004. Conair Corporation, an acknowledged leader in the personal care & culinary appliance industries joins with its Board of Directors, Executive Officers and all of its employees, to grieve the sad loss, and passing of one of its highly regarded and distinguished Board Members. He was a partner in the auditing firm -Deloitte & Touche (formerly Touche, Ross and J.K. Lasser) until his retirement in 1987. Since 1987 he was a member of Conair's Board of Directors, a member of Conair's Audit Committee since 1989 and served as a consultant to Conair from 1987-2001. He played a key role and was instrumental in Conair's sale of its Zotos subsidiary to the Shiseido Company in 1988. He was a long time personal friend of Conair's founder Lee Rizzuto, and the Rizzuto family, Conair's Board and countless Conair employees. Mel will be sadly missed by all at Conair. We join together to extend our deepest condolences to his wife and our dear friend Bobbie, his loving children Neil and Anne, and his entire family.
