        JAY-Robert Dean. The Board of Trustees and staff of the Heckscher Museum of Art records with profound sorrow the passing of our former Trustee, long-time friend and supporter, Robert Dean Jay. As a member of the Collections/Exhibitions Committee of the Board and one of the founding fellows of the Eva Gatling Collectors Circle, Bob, together with his wife, Cynthia, helped shape the Heckscher's collections and acquisitions policy. He will be deeply missed. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his wife and family. Catherine A. Jansen, Chairman, Board of Trustees Shirley Rubin, 1st Vice Chairman John E. Coraor, Ph.D., Director
