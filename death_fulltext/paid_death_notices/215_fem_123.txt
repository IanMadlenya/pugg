        MARTIN--Agnes. The Board of Trustees and staff of the Whitney Museum of American Art note with great sadness the passing of Agnes Martin. Through her art of sublime equilibrium and transcendent radiance, Agnes Martin aesthetically communicated the experience of happiness, contentment, and oneness with the world. A beloved artist in our permanent collection, her involvement with the Museum for the last four decades has left an indelible mark on all of us. She taught us all to see the perfection within life. We extend our most heartfelt condolences to all those who knew her. Leonard A. Lauder, Chairman Robert J. Hurst, President Adam D. Weinberg, Director Board of Trustees and Staff
