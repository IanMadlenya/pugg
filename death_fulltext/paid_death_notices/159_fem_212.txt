        KISSANE-Lucille Paolillo. The administration, staff and Franciscan Missionaries of Mary at St. Francis Hospital, The Heart Center, of Roslyn, mourn the loss of our friend and colleague. As Vice President for Development since 1992, Lucille's talent for building lasting relationships transferred well to her efforts on behalf of the Hospital, guiding a program that raised nearly $50 million and securing the largest single gift of $3 million. Lucille's life was filled with many accomplishments, including being named a 1985 Fulbright scholar. We honor Lucille as a beloved wife, loving mother, devoted daughter and caring sister, aunt, sister-in-law and friend. May she rest in peace.
        KISSANE-Lucille Paolillo. We miss your smile, your guidance, your passion for life, and most of all, your love and friendship. We treasure the time we shared with you. You will always be in our hearts. Linda, Wendy, Denise, LuLu, Christina, Mary Lou, Suzanne, Carmen, Maria, Angela
