        BARON-Samuel. The Juilliard School mourns the passing of Samuel Baron, distinguished member of the flute faculty since 1971 and chairman of the Woodwind Department for the past several years. His extraordinary artistry, his dedication to his students, and his exceptional creativity as an arranger of woodwind ensemble music made him a revered member of the Juilliard community. As the flutist of the New York Woodwind Quintet, he helped develop the woodwind chamber music program at The Juilliard School and brought it to new levels of excellence. He will be deeply missed by us all. Mary Rodgers Guettel Chairman, Board of Trustees Joseph W. Polisi President
