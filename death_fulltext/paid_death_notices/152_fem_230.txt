        KESSEL-Marie Adler. The staff of the PIBLY Residential Program and the Board of the PIPLY Fund express profound sadness at the loss of their founder and guiding spirit. A vibrant woman of tremendous energy and creativity, she worked tirelessly on behalf of the mentally ill. The memory of her gernerosity and her accomplishments will live on, but her forceful personality and leadership will never be replaced. We extend our deepest condolences to the Kessel family at the passing of this unique woman. A memorial service is planned in the near future at Kessel House. Susan Jacobs, Director, PIPLY Residential Programs Inc. Itamar Salamon, M.D. Chairman, PIBLY Fund
