        EINFRANK-Aaron R., 69. Died in Rosenheim, Germany on July 11, 2002 of complications due to a fall. An award winning journalist Aaron Robert Einfrank began his career at the New York Herald Tribune while still in college. After graduating from Washington Square College, New York University in 1955, he served in the U.S. Army as a linguist and staff writer for Stars and Stripes. In 1957 he returned to the Tribune as Wire Editor for its news service. In 1960, he was named United Nations Bureau Chief by the Toronto Telegram. His work earned him a Sigma Delta Chi award for distinguished UN reporting. In 1963 he took a sabbatical to become a Ford Fellow at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism. In 1967 he became the Telegram's Moscow Bureau Chief. His hard-hitting, no holds barred reporting on the Soviet system led to his expulsion in 1969. After Moscow, he became the paper's Washington, D.C. Bureau Chief, where he remained until the Telegram ceased publication in 1971. He was later employed by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty as a foreign affairs editor based in Munich, Germany. He held a variety of positions including Islamabad Bureau Chief. From Pakistan, he reported on the 1979 War in Afghanistan. He retired from the Corporation in 1991. Before his illness, he was planning a book on radical Islam. His professional affiliations included the National Press Club, The Overseas Press Club, the Columbia and Williams Clubs of New York. He is survived by his sister, Eileen Einfrank of Manhattan. On Monday, September 30 at 5:10PM a Memorial Mass will be said at the Church of Our Saviour, 38th Street and Park Avenue.
