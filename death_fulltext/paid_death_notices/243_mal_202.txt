Husband of the late Suzannah Ryan Wilkie, he is survived by his children, Angus Wilkie of New York, NY, Austin Wilkie of New York, NY, and Serena Wilkie Gifford of Cambridge, MA, and by his grandchildren, Suzannah Gifford and Abbott Gifford. Born in Tamsui, Formosa, he was a graduate of Williams College, Harvard Medical School and New York Psychoanalytic Institute. He practiced psychoanalysis privately in Manhattan for over 40 years, while also serving as Associate Professor of Psychiatry on the faculty at Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons. In summer months, he was president of Lac a Gravel trout fishing club in Charlevoix, Quebec, and organist at Murray Bay Protestant Church. Work and family were his music; his concise judgments and succinct wit in all endeavors will be long-remembered.
