        KAUFMAN--Jess. Jess' many close friends throughout the telecommunications industry sadly mourn his passing. Jess was a leader and a specialist in the telecommunications needs of this and other countries' hospitals and he collaborated with the industry in analysing, then uniquely directing the design, development, installation and maintenance of the equipment. We extend our love and heartfelt condolences to his dear wife, Selma, and to his children. Jess was one of a kind who will always be missed.
