        BAREISS -- Molly (Mary) Stimson. Molly (Mary) Stimson Bareiss (1920-2006) was the soul that held our family together. She was a true, no nonsense Yankee with a generous heart, a gentle spirit and a fierce loyalty. She guarded the inner circle, was an excellent judge of character, and those she let in were friends for life. The elegance of her straight posture denied her failed joints from a rheumatic youth. It didn't keep her from an active sport's life and rough-housing with children. A pioneer graduate of Bennington College, a Kindergarten teacher, a painter and a philanthropist, Molly was a forceful balance to a very dynamic husband. At the age of forty, she followed Walter to Germany. Although not speaking a word of German, she eventually became fluent and established a home for her family and a large circle of friends. Her insight was invaluable in moments of family crisis. She understood what was happening and had love for all. The loss of her wisdom and sense of fun leaves a void in our hearts. Molly died at home surrounded by her family on February 20th. The last two years were not kind to her. It was her time to go.. She had a clear and constant courage; we see the best of her in our families and in the hope for our future. We will miss her. She is survived by her husband Walter, her five children, 11 grandchildren and many nieces and nephews. In addition to living overseas Molly has been a resident of Greenwich, CT since the late '40s. For those who knew Molly the family requests a contributions to a memory book. In lieu of flowers we ask that a donation be made in her name either to the Center for Family Life in Sunset Park, 345-43rd Street, Brooklyn, NY 11232 or The October Fund Arthritis Foundation, 222 East 42nd Street, 18th Floor, New York, NY 10168-1898.
