        OWETT--Bernard, 79. Beloved husband, father, grandfather, brother, uncle, and friend died on February 22, of complications from a fall. Loved so very deeply and survived by his wife Trudy, son Adam, daughter Margot, their spouses Marsha and Ken, grandchildren Gideon, Clara Rose, and Lola, as well as by his sisters, Bess and Ethel, sister-in-law Erika and many nephews and nieces. Bernie was an artist, and a leading creative force in the advertising field. He spent his professional life at J. Walter Thompson creating award-winning advertising, mentoring the industry's future stars and loving every minute of it. So many will remember his inspiring influence, infectious enthusiasm and innate style. Bernie, its so hard to accept that your tenderness, humor, decency and intelligence are now a memory. The funeral and interment will be private. Those wishing to visit the family can do so evenings, Sunday, February 25, Monday, February 26, or Tuesday, February 27. (Call 212-673-6282 for time and location.) A memorial service will be announced later. Contributions may be made in his memory to the Art Center College of Design, 1700 Lida Street, Pasadena, California 91103.
