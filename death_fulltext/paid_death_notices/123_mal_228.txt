        KATZ-Leslie G. Ballet Society notes with great sadness the death of Leslie Katz, founder and guiding spirit of the extraordinary Eakins Press Foundation. He leaves a rich and elegant legacy. It was our particular honor to collaborate with him on projects commemorating the work of George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein. Sincerest condolences to his family, and most especially to Jane Mayhall. Nancy Lassalle, President Thomas Schoff, Treasurer
