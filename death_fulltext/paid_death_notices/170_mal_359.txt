        LUNDIN-A. Peter, M.D. The SUNY Downstate Medical Center community mourns the passing of A. Peter Lundin, M.D., clinical professor of medicine at SUNY Downstate and director of ambulatory hemodialysis at Kings County Hospital Center. An alumnus of Downstate, Dr. Lundin was the first person to complete medical school on dialysis and the longest surving dialysis patient. He was also a pioneering patient advocate. We extend our condolences to his relatives and his many colleagues and friends. John C. LaRosa, M.D., President Eugene B. Feigelson, M.D., Dean of the College of Medicine
