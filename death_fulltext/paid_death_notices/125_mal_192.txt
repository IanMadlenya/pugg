        RAGER-Mayor Yitzhack I. The officers, directors and friends of the American Committee for the Beer-Sheva Foundation mourn the passing of our founder, our leader, the heart and soul of our organization-our neshama. His distinguished career as a military leader, journalist, radio commentator, businessman, diplomat, International President of State of Israel Bonds, in the Soviet Jewry Movement and Mayor of Beer-Sheva are well documented. The crowned jewel in his extraordinary life of achievement has been his mayoralty of Beer-Sheva. In eight years he led the sleepy desert town of Beer-Sheva to unbelieveable growth and development. His dynamic leadership, foresight, vision and energy have helped Beer-Sheva to become a major city in Israel. Today, Beer-Sheva is truly the capital of the Negev and is helping fulfill the Ben-Gurion dream of the development of the Negev. ''Ijo,'' your legacy will live on forever. Sidney Cooperman Chairman of the Board Elie Wiesel Honorary Chairman of the Board Ronald Slevin, President
