        LABALME-Patricia Hochschild. The Faculty, Trustees and staff of the Institute for Advanced Study are deeply saddened by the loss of Patricia Labalme, friend, colleague and scholar. She was the Associate Director of the Institute from 1982-1988; Secretary of the Corporation from 1982-1992; Assistant to the Director, Phillip A. Griffiths, from 1992-1997; and, most recently, a Visitor in the Institutes' School of Historical Studies, working to complete a book on the Venetian Diarist Marino Sanudo. All who knew Patsy admired her devotion to the humanities and social sciences, respected her personal commitment to the scholarship of the Renaissance, benefited from her wisdom and treasured her friendship. She exemplified the highest standards in all that she did. We extend our deepest sympathy to her husband, George, and her entire family. James D. Wolfensohn, Chairman of the Board Phillip A. Griffiths, Director
