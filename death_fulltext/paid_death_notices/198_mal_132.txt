        SPEARS--Jackson E. It is with a deep sense of loss that New York Medical College mourns the passing of our colleague and friend, Jackson E. Spears. He devoted his time and thoughtful presence to our institution like no other, twice acting as President and serving on the Board of Trustees for an unprecedented 60 years. He received our highest honors--an honorary Doctor of Science degree, the Terence Cardinal Cooke Medal for Distinguished Service in Health Care, and the William Cullen Bryant Medal. His inspiring leadership and dedication to the larger community led us to establish an annual community service award in his name. We will miss his practical wisdom and unselfish dedication, and we extend our heartfelt condolences to his family. Ronald F. Poe, Chairman Board of Trustees Rev. Msgr. Harry C. Barrett President and CEO Ralph A. O'Connell, M.D. Provost and Dean School of Medicine >>AD#
