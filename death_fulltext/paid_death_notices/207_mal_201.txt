        BECKER--Steve. Age 49. Steve didn't want to leave his family. He vigorously fought pancreatic cancer so he could be a Dad as long as possible. His loss leaves a huge void in the lives of his wife, Elaine Shay, and his children Ana 15, Laura 12, and twins Seren and Strat two and a half. Although successful in many entrepreneurial endeavors and highly respected for his business acumen and marketing skills, he cherished his family most. Steve taught us what mattered and we will miss him. Services were held on Friday, April 16, 2004.
