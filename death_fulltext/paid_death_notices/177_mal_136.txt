Our deepest sympathies to his wife, Jane and their children. Martin M. Berger, Mayor
        McGOWAN-Edward J. Saltaire has lost a kind and noble soul. Ed loved and was loved by everyone who knew him, and no man was ever blessed with a finer family. You were smart and funny, and a pleasure to be around, Ed. Our thanks and prayers always. ''Take it easy, kid''. Hugh O'Brien, Chairman, SCAA
