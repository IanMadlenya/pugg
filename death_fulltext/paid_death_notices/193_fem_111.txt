        GREENBERG-Jill Warren (Mary Audrey Rochlen). Beloved mother of Peter Greenberg and Dr. Karen Greenberg Rudman. Wife of the late Dr. Sidney Greenberg. Sister of Kendis, David, Hartwell, Gail and the late Donald Rochlen and a longtime devoted friend of Lucille Fore, died on February 7, 2003, at her home in Manhattan. The daughter of journalist and aviation industry pioneer A.M. Rochlen, she was born July 4, 1915 in Los Angeles. She was an actress, singer, a magazine and newspaper journalist, and for many years a real estate broker in Manhattan and Fire Island, NY. She had boundless energy and an extraordinary spirit that touched and enriched countless lives. A selfless woman devoted to her siblings and her children, her legacy is a life eternally distinguished by not merely being interesting-for she was a great story teller and philosopher-but of being interested in the stories and philosophies of everyone she ever met. She is survived by her son, daughter, and son-in-law Richard Rudman. A memorial service will be held on Saturday, February 15, 12 noon at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street. In honor and celebration of the life of Jill Warren Greenberg, please send donations to the Union Settlement Association, 237 E. 104 St. NY, NY 10029 attention Laura Johnson. We will love her always.
