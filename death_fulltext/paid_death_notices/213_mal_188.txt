        COOKE--M. Todd. The Musicians, Trustees and Staff of the Marlboro Music School and Festival mourn the loss of their longtime friend and trustee, and extend their sympathy to his wife Peggy and his family. As a member of the Board for almost three decades, and as Treasurer and Vice President for many of those years, Todd brought to Marlboro, and to the musicians in his annual summer visits to Vermont, the devotion and integrity that made him such a valued member of our family. Stephen Stamas, Chairman Board of Trustees
