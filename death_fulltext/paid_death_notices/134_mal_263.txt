        GREENBERG-Philip, 83 of Woodstock, NY, formerly of Jackson Heights, died March 19, 1998. Husband of the late Evelyn, father of Leslie and Robert, grandfather of Justin and Gavin, brother of Rabbi Sidney Greenberg and Sara Aboff, dear friend and companion of Shirley Fink. Former ''tie-coon'' extraordinaire, a lover of life and people, happy and always productive-he lived fully to the very end. Richer for having known him, he leaves behind a large family of relatives and friends and a long trail of smiles... Contributions may be made to the Woodstock Jewish Congregation Building Fund.
