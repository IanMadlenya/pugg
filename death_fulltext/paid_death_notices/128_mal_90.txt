        RABON-Jay L. A genuine Southern gentleman who had a fascination with the world. Always amusing, kind, charming, loving and compassionate; he lived intensely and left us suddenly and unexpectedly of heart failure on the beaches of Corsica, France, on August 6, 1997. He was one of those truly gracious individuals who made life much more pleasant for everyone around him. Jay taught us to be better friends. We loved him living and we love him still. He will be greatly missed. His extended family and friends in New York, Watermill, Florida, France, Mexico and Argentina, and his life partner, Dr. Joshua Algaze, will gather to honor his memory on the day that would have marked his 51st birthday, next Sunday, September 14, 1997 at the Harmonie Club, 4 East 60 Street, New YorK at 5 P.M.
