        LICHTENBERG -- Laura R. Mom/Nana, Thank you for all of the beautiful memories. They will stay in our hearts forever: making matzoh balls with us, saving your make up brushes for us, teaching us to tap, always having raspberries for us, always allowing us, even at your sickest, to put on your make up and do your hair. Always letting us ''do a show'' for you. Always letting us wear your tee shirts to sleep so you're always close to us. Most of all, we thank you for your complete and unconditional love. That we will cherish forever. ''We love you a bushel and a peck'' Love and kisses, Susie, Todd, Nicki, Katie and Jennie
