        WELLING--Kathryn T. Our beloved angel Kate has joined the angels in Heaven much too soon. Having just celebrated her 21st birthday on March 30, she was excited and enthusiastic about life in general, but particularly about her impending semester abroad in Luxembourg. She embodied the concept of beauty, both on the inside and the outside. She was a loving, caring and giving person whose greatest joys were being with and caring for young children, as a Camp Counselor at Camp Fernwood, a Swim Counselor at Camp Mohawk, in a community service program in Fiji, and most passionately as an aunt to Reese and Chase Welling. Her death in a fire at an offcampus residence at Miami University in Ohio on April 10th has left a void that can never be filled. She was a loving daughter to Tom and Helen, a loving sister to Kurt and Thomas, a loving granddaughter to Evelyn, a loving aunt to Reese and Chase, a loving niece to more than 20 aunts and uncles, a loving cousin to dozens, and a loving and supportive friend to all who were fortunate enough to bask in her warming light. She will be missed and mourned by all who knew her, but will never be forgotten. Calling hours at the Fred H. McGrath & Son Funeral Home, Bronxville, between the hours of 6 to 9 PM Thursday, 2 to 4 and 7 to 9 PM Friday. Mass of Christian Burial St. Joseph's Church, Bronxville, on Saturday, April 16th, at 10 AM. In lieu of flowers or donations to charities, contributions may be sent to The Kathryn T. Welling Memorial Fund and mailed to Dennis Glazer, Esq. at Davis Polk & Wardwell, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10017.
