        KURTZMAN-Allan H. The Hunter College community mourns the loss of our distinguished alumnus and loyal supporter, Allan H. Kurtzman. A member of the Hunter College Hall of Fame, former Chair of the Hunter College Foundation Board of Trustees and former President and Chief Operating Officer of the Neutrogena Corporation, he was a tireless and dedicated supporter of Hunter College and its mission of education, research and service. We will miss his energy, his wise counsel and his concern for the students, faculty & staff of Hunter College. We extend our deepest sympathy to his devoted wife, Maxine, and his loving daughters. Jennifer J. Raab, President, Hunter College Eileen Caulfield Schwab, Chair, Hunter College Foundation, Board of Trustees
