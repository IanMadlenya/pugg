        THORPE-Frances (nee Wills). On January 18, 1998. The Auxiliary of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden mourns the passing of our most devoted and endearing past president, who was the consummate volunteer, assisting the Garden in its many events and activities. She will long be remembered personally as a dear friend, and as a loyal supporter of the Garden. We offer our sincerest condolences to her husband Charles.
