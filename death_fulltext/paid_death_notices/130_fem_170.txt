        MACDOUGALL-Rella. The members of the board and the shareholders of 480 Park Avenue are deeply saddened by the passing of our longtime director and officer, Rella Mac Dougall. We admiringly remember not only her dedication and judgement but most especially her sensitivity and charm. She graced our building and will be greatly missed by all of us at 480.
