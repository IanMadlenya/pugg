        WOOLFSON-Saul, 90 years. Deeply loved husband of Esther Mary (nee Beck). They had a great life together for forty-three years. He was the first public affairs specialist with the Social Security Administration. During a career that spanned 45 years, he received many awards for excellent quality of work. He defended the social security program where others feared to tread by writing letters to editors of top newspapers. He was able to obtain unprecedented free advertising such as billboard advertising in Times Square, time tables and magazines to benefit the program. He was an all around great guy.
