        MELTON--Florence. The American Friends of The Hebrew University (AFHU) and The Hebrew University of Jerusalem mourn the passing of our dear friend Florence Melton, a passionate advocate for Jewish education. Her love of Israel and the Jewish people is reflected in every aspect of her distinctive life. Professionally and philanthropically innovative, Florence Melton received an honorary doctorate from The Hebrew University and AFHUs Scopus Award, the highest honor conferred by American Friends. Mrs. Melton and her beloved husband Samuel (zl) established the Samuel Melton Center for Jewish Education at The Hebrew University. The Melton Center represents the Meltons longstanding commitment to Jewish education and has trained generations of Jewish educators, developed curriculum and shared Jewish knowledge and values with people throughout the world. The Florence Melton Adult Mini-School Institute, a pioneering concept, develops Jewish literacy and is in the forefront of contemporary Jewish education. Our prayers and thoughts are with her children and grandchildren. Menachem Magidor, President, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem Ira Lee Sorkin, Chairman of the Board, AFHU George A. Schieren, President, AFHU Peter T. Willner, National Executive Director, AFHU
