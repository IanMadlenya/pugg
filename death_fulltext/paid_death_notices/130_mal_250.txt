        SILVEY-Harold D. On behalf of the Officers, Trustees and entire Congregation, we mourn the loss of our esteemed honorary president. Harold led this congregation with devotion, loyalty and distinction. He was always jovial and always gave his first concern to his family and to the Temple. Our heartfelt sympathy is expressed to his beloved wife Lucille and family. May his memory be for a blessing. Linda Henry Goodman, Rabbi Hortense Hurwitz, President Union Temple of Brooklyn
