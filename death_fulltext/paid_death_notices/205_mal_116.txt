        OGRIN--Les. Died February 7, 2004. He lived his own life and he lived it well, filled with music, with accomplishments, with love which he unselfishly shared with the rest of us. How blessed we were to be family and have him in our lives. Our time together was too short--good times always are. But he filled our hearts and enriches our memories. If there is a swing band in heaven, he will be playing a trumbone that surely will make the angels sing. His Loving Cousins Xiaoyan and Irv Drasnin
