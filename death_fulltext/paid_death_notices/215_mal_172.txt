        DIAO--Richard (''Dick'') K., age 80, died December 3, 2004 in Walnut Creek, CA. A native of Chengdu (Sichuan), China, Dick has lived in the US for over 40 years. Among six other siblings, Dick was son of Lieutenant General William Shih-Chieh Diao (Cmdr 95th Army, Republic of China) and Pei-Chi Chen. Dick touched many lives with his infectious smile and gentle spirit. Dick received his economics degree at National Central University in Chungking, China, earned his MS at the University of Illinois, and did his PhD work at New York University. Dick returned to China with his fiance Eva Hsu in 1950 to work at the Central Ministry of Finance as a researcher. Dick taught economics at the Central Institute of Finance in Beijing until branded a ''rightist'' by the Communist Party and sent to a collective farm as a forced laborer. Dick subsequently fled to Hong Kong with his young son and was later joined by his wife and daughter, and then emigrated to the United States. Dick was a Research Associate at Columbia University while he completed his research on two published economic textbooks on the People's Republic of China. Dick and his family then moved to the Washington, DC area where he was an editor for 22 years at Voice of America (US State Department). Dick was deeply devoted to Eva, his beloved wife of 54 years, whom he had courted while she was attending college in Iowa, and the two returned to China together to pursue their life dreams. Theirs was a remarkable tale of a life that revolved around their mutual love and devotion. During their later years, they enjoyed many activities together, including round dancing, square dancing, cruising, and mahjong. Besides Eva, Dick is survived by his children Nancy and Charlie, and five lovely grandchildren, Willie, Kelsey, Eva, Devin, and Linley, as well as an extended family of Dick's siblings, his nieces and nephews, and their many children and grandchildren.
