        RADWELL-Martin. Marty was our friend in college and our friend in life. For almost fifty years we were the beneficiaries of his humor, his humanity & his deep spirituality. For the last 13 of those years, we were witness to his remarkable courage as he fought illness and pain with humor and strength. Marty was a person deserving our everlasting admiration. He will be fondly remembered by all who knew him. Beta Delta Mu Fraternity Baruch College
