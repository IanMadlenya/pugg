        GUTTMANN--Ruth, M.D. The faculty, staff and students of Columbia University Health Sciences Division mourn the loss of our colleague and friend, Dr. Ruth Guttmann. Dr. Guttmann served on the faculty in the Department of Radiology at Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons from 1953 until her retirement in 1976. She also served as Director of the Department of Radiotherapy and Nuclear Medicine at the Delafield Hospital from 1963 to 1976. In 1993, Dr. Guttmann established the Thomas S. Zimmer Professorship of Reconstructive Surgery at Columbia in honor of her husband. In 1997, Dr. Guttmann established the George Guttmann Professorship Fund in honor of her father to be used toward creating the George Guttmann Professorship of Craniofacial Surgery at Columbia's School of Dental and Oral Surgery. Dr. Guttmann was a thoughtful, caring and compassionate physician. She will be deeply missed. Gerald D.
