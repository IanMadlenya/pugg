        FRIEDMAN-Naomi. April 8, 2001. We deeply mourn the sudden passing of our beloved friend and colleague. She was a champion of peoples' rights and human dignity wherever these values were threatened, at home or abroad. Her abundant love, her wry sense of humor & her generous goodwill will be sorely missed. We shall never forget her. The Center For Cuban Studies
