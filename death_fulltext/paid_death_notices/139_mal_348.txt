        GOLDMAN-Robert I. The last of the Renaissance men. He was a master of so many things but most of all, he was a master of himself. His Jewish philanthropy was done soley for the sake of helping his people. Of him, did our Sages say, ''He who does not seek honor; honor will seek him out.'' We will miss him. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Melva and to his family on this unexpected and tragic loss. Dorothy and Andrew Tananbaum
        GOLDMAN-Robert I. We mourn the loss of a gentleman, a friend, a competitor, and an innovator. He was of the school of thought that believed: hard work and honesty are the ingredients for success in life and in business. May we be worthy of the high standards he set for all of us. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Melva and his family. Century Business Credit Corp.
