        DILWORTH-J. Richardson. The Board of Trustees, Faculty and staff of the Institute for Advanced Study are deeply saddened by the passing of J. Richardson Dilworth. He served as Trustee of the Institute from 1964 to 1986 and was an active Trustee Emeritus from 1986 until his death. He was Chairman of the Board of Trustees from 1981 to 1986, and before that served as Vice Chairman and President. He made a unique contribution to the development of the Institute. Through his good judgment and his support, he set the course which we are now following. He had a remarkable ability to cross from the province of business to a sensitive understanding of academic life and the importance of research at its highest level. He was loved and admired, both for his character and for his intellect; his kindness and his work will long be remembered. We extend to Elizabeth, Joseph, Lucy and Charles our love and heartfelt condolences. James D. Wolfensohn, Chairman Leon Levy, Vice Chairman and President Phillip A. Griffiths, Director
