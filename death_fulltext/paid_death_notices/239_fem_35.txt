        ELLIOTT--Eleanor T. The Board of Trustees and Staff of the Wildlife Conservation Society are deeply saddened by the death of our dear friend Elly Elliott, wife of long time Trustee, Jock Elliott. Elly graced us with her charm and presence at hundreds of events for over 30 years. She was a member of The WCS Wildlife Heritage Circle. Elly loved wildlife and wild places and joined Jock in making a personal commitment to WCS's conservation mission. Elly will be missed by all. We extend our deepest sympathies to her family. David T. Schiff, Chairman Board of Trustees Steven E. Sanderson, President and CEO
