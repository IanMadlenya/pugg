        TURELL-Evelyn Gilson. The Trustees, Faculty, and Staff of Mount Sinai School of Medicine deeply mourn the passing of Evelyn Gilson Turell, a generous benefactress, and the wife of the late Dr. Robert Turell, a prominent surgeon, who served Mount Sinai and his patients with dedication and distinction for fifty-eight years. Evelyn Turell's outstanding support of Mount Sinai included the establishment of the Robert and Evelyn Turell Professorship in Endoscopic Surgery and other contributions to medical research. Mrs. Turell will be remembered fondly, and with gratitude, for her loyalty and thoughtful generosity. We extend our heartfelt condolences to her entire family. Stephen M. Peck, Chairman, The Mount Sinai Medical Center Nathan Kase, Interim Pres. & CEO The Mount Sinai Medical Center and Interim Dean, Mount Sinai School of Medicine Barry R. Freedman, President and CEO The Mount Sinai Hospital
