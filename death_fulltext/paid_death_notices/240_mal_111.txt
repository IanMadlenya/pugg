        MURAVCHIK--Emanuel. The officers, staff and members of the Jewish Labor Committee note with deep sadness the death of Emanuel Muravchik, Executive Director Emeritus and longtime member of the staff of the Jewish Labor Committee from 19471984. He served as National Field Director and Executive Director. He directed the antidiscrimination work of the JLC in the U.S. and Canada, and, in 1962, gave a report to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions on Soviet anti-Semitism, resulting in the Confederation's being the first to raise this issue at the U.N. He directed our study of the Southern labor movement and the race question soon after the Supreme Court's desegregation decision. Heartfelt condolences to his wife, Miriam, their sons and family. Stuart Appelbaum, President Avram B. Lyon, Executive Director
