        LIEBLER-William A., MD. The Board of Trustees and Medical Staff of Lenox Hill Hospital express their sorrow at the passing of William A. Liebler, MD, a distiguished member of our Orthopedic Surgery Department for 39 years. Dr. Liebler was an outstanding surgeon who was highly regarded as a spine surgeon. He was also a leader in sports medicine who was as dedicated to the care of professional athletes and dancers as he was to weekend athletes. A gifted teacher, Dr. Liebler took great joy in sharing his knowledge with young physicians. It was apparent to all those who knew him that Dr. Liebler loved his profession and, in the practice of it, exemplified its highest standards. The Lenox Hill Hospital family extends its deepest sympathies to his family. James S. Marcus, Chairman, Board of Trustees Gladys George, President & CEO Allen H. Collins, MD, MPH, President, Medical Board
