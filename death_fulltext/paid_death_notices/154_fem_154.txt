        WEINSTEIN-Doris. It is with great regret that we mark the passing of Doris Weinstein, a true Woman of Valor and a person that we should all try to emulate. Doris always looked at the bright side of everything. It was indeed difficult to tell that she was ill when you were with her. Her positive attitude about life and all it has to bring is a lesson we can all learn from. Our sincere sympathy to our dear friend Ira, the family, and all those whose life she touched.
