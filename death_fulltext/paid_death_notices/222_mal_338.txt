        WATERS--Stuart. As ''Reader's Digest'' used to chronicle, ''the most unforgettable person we ever met.'' The friends and family of Stu Waters mourn his sudden passing from complications of leukemia on July 29, at the age of 67. Born in Brooklyn, a graduate of Lafayette High School and Florida State, Stu lived life to the fullest. He loved the ponies, football, tennis and a beverage or two. But most of all he loved his wife or 37 years, Karmen, and his friends. He enjoyed his work--for almost 50 years managing hotels and eventually to GM of the Philmont Country Club in Huntingdon Valley, PA. Wherever he went you could be sure Stu was having a good time and all those around him were too. There will be a memorial service in the near future.
