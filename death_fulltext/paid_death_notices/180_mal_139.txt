        GLASER-David. The Board, members and staff of the Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA) mourn the passing of David Glaser. David, who served from 1980 to 1999 as the president of the Parker Jewish Institute for Health Care and Rehabilitation, and who, from 1988 to 1991, served as a member of GNYHA's Board of Governors, was a visionary leader and advocate for the elderly and disabled, and a pioneer in the development of short-term rahabilitation and community-based services in the continuing care arena. We are all deeply indebted to David for the tremendous contributions that his life and work brought to the advancement of continuing care services in our community. We extend our sincere condolences to the Glaser family and their many friends. Kenneth E. Raske, President GNYHA Scott C. Amrhein, Exec. Director GNYHA's Center for Continuing Care
