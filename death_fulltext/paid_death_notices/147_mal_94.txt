        BERGER-Graenum. The Graenum Berger Bronx Jewish Federation Service Center expresses its profound sorrow upon the passing of Graenum Berger, one of our founders. He returned his soul to his Maker after more than fifty years of distinguished and dedicated labor of love for the Jewish community. He personified and fulfilled the fundamental Jewish teaching that the purpose of our sojourn on earth is to serve and enable others. His commitment to chesed and tzedakah for his Jewish brethren in need through compassion, undaunting effort and excellence will continue to inspire and serve as a role model. May the Al-mighty comfort his life's partner and beloved wife, Emma, son, Michael and the entire family among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem and spare them further sorrow.
