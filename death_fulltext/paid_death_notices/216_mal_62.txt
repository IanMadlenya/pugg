        KELLER--Peter. Age 87, of New Rochelle, New York. Devoted husband of Norma for 59 years, beloved father of Lisa and Nina, father-in-law of Saky Yakas and Richard Adago, grandfather of Benjamin Yakas and Perry and Naomi Adago. Pete, as everyone called him, spent 56 years at the Wall Street Journal, where he started in 1945 in the composing room and rose to national news editor during an illustrious career. For more than 25 years he served as night news editor, creating one of the highest editing standards in the nation. He trained several generations of reporters and editors, who called him the ''living legend'' of the Journal. After a formal retirement he returned to The Journal as a consultant and editor. During WWII he served as a warrant officer in the Fifth Army in North Africa and Italy, and received a Bronze Star for meritorious service. A voracious reader of history and literature, he imbued his two daughters with his love of learning, as he dedicated his life to them. His humor, intelligence, patience, and moral compass are irreplaceable. Funeral Service will be held Friday, January 7 at Temple Israel of New Rochelle, 12 Noon, interment at Sharon Gardens to follow. The family will receive visitors at home afterwards. Contributions can be made to the Peter Keller Journalism Scholarship Fund at Purchase College, 735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, NY 10577. For information George T.
