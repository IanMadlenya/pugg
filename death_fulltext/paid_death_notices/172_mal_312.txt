        MICHEL-Henry L. Henry's dear friends mourn the passing of our friend, a distinguished gentleman, a mentor and a mensch. From his sage advise to his unique perspectives on politics, business and world events, the world is diminished by Henry's absence. Dear friend, if you could read this, you would be embarrassed and annoyed. But we all loved you very much and will miss you until we join you. Michael K. De Chiara, Michael S. Zetlin, Raymond T. Mellon and all of your friends at Zetlin & De Chiara LLP.
