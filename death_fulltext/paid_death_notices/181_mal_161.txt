        HANDELSMAN-Richard, 63. Died unexpectedly Friday, February 8 in his Woodstock, Ill. home. Services were held February 11 at Congregation B'nai Torah in Highland Park, Ill. Mr. Handelsman graduated from Cornell University in 1960 with a degree in Engineering Physics. He earned his Master's and Ph.D from the Courant Institute of Mathematics. Richard worked on the communication satellite Telstar at Bell Labs and taught applied math at Brown University before becoming a full Professor of Advanced Mathematics at the University of Illinois. He co-authored the graduate level textbook ''Asymptotic Expansions of Integrals'' and published more than 50 research papers on various subjects of applied mathematics and physics. Richard was an original member of the Chicago Board Options Exchange. As member of the Board of Directors, pit trader and clearing firm owner, Mr. Handelsman was an integral force shaping the ultimate structure of the Exchange. He was a renowned expert in option trading and theory, and regarded as the originator of the ''butterfly spread.'' Richard Handelsman was a top level bridge player and earned extra money during college competing with several future Bermuda Bowl winners. Very proud and nostalgic of his Brooklyn roots, still Richard took to life in the country. He designed and built a park from a cornfield. The park became a sculpture garden of Shona stone art from Zimbabwe. Richard is survived by his wife Susan, his son Gary Handelsman, daughter Robin (Eric) Gould, sister Arlene (Jay) Gold, and his beloved dog, Dodger. He worked very hard, he was extraordinarily loyal, and he is unforgettable.
