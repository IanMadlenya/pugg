        SOFER--Janet. With extraordinary sadness we note the passing of our very dear friend, Jan. Despite a seeming onslaught of medical problems, Jan never seemed to lose her balance or courage. She delighted in the company of her friends and family and, in particular, her devoted husband, Saul. She took great pleasure from the arts, good food and travel. Jan was wonderful company. We will love her always and will miss her greatly. Arlene Petroff and Ed Grossman
