        ROSSETTI-Andrew Joseph. Student and dear friend to many, on February 3, 2001. On behalf of the students and faculty of Hopkins School, we wish to offer our deepest condolences to his family, especially his sister Paige, our schoolmate. Andrew was a guiding light to all who had the privilege of knowing him. His confident voice and steady hand will be missed dearly. It is with great and heartfelt sorrow that we say farewell to one of own.
