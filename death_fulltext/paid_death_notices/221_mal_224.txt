        NELSON--Cyril Irwin. The Board of Trustees and professional staff of the American Folk Art Museum record with profound sorrow the death of their friend and colleague Cyril Irwin Nelson. A Trustee since 1974 and recently elected Trustee Emeritus, Cy will be remembered for his quiet dignity, his gentlemanly manner, his passion for textiles, his fine eye, and for the significance of his generous contributions to the Museum's permanent collection. He has left a legacy of enduring importance to American art and culture. We extend our sympathy to his niece Anna; his brothers Guerdon, Nicholas, and Michael; and his partner Cary Baker.
