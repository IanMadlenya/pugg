        HERTZBERG -- Benjamin, died suddenly, January 16, 2004. Dr. Diane E. Meier, Director of the Lilian and Benjamin Hertzberg Palliative Care Institute, and Dr. Albert Siu, Chair of the Brookdale Department of Geriatrics and Adult Development of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, and their faculty and staff, mourn the loss of Benjamin Hertzberg. A successful brewer and businessman, ardent photographer, and accomplished cellist, Benjamin Hertzberg was a committed and visionary philanthropist dedicated to improving the care of persons living with serious illness, and their families. With Lilian, his wife of 58 years, he established the Hertzberg Palliative Care Institute at Mount Sinai --a national model for the emerging field of hospital-based palliative care. We will miss him, and extend deepest sympathy to our dear friend and patron, Lilian Hertzberg.
