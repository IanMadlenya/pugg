        LUNZER--J.P. Nearly six decades ago, Peter crossed the ocean, married his beloved Shoshana (Skydell) obm, and earned an indelible place in the hearts of her siblings and their growing families. Business executive, sportsman, world-traveler, he was always ''away'', yet always there for our milestones. At celebrations he was debonair and merry, bringing to mind the dashing officer who served His Majesty's Navy in WWII. In times of grief we and the community counted upon his expert, quiet guidance as leader of the Chevra Kadisha. For this service, for his leadership as Gabbai, and numerous deeds of lovingkindness, Peter won the rarely-bestowed title of Chaver of the Jewish Center. But more than any of his many honors, he cherished the blessing of seeing his children and grandchildren continue the tradition of Torah, hospitality, and communal outreach learned in their parents' home. May the wonderful Lunzer family be comforted in remembering: ''He who finds favor in the eyes of man finds favor in the eyes of HaShem.'' Hilda Riback, the Propp and Zwang family
