        ROGOWSKY-Edward T. The Board, staff and members of the Empire State Pride Agenda mourn the passing of Edward T. Rogowsky, political activist, scholar and public servant. Ed served his city and his country with distinction. He was a leader in the campaign to elect Bill Bradley President of the United States and helped to elevate and change the national discussion of the rights of lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and transgender people and their families. We offer our deep condolences to his partner, Peter McGarry, to his sons and grandson and to his enormous circle of family and friends.
