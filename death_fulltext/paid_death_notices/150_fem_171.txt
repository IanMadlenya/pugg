        SCHWARTZ-Elizabeth. Congregation Ohav Shalom mourns the tragic death of Elizabeth (Elisheva) Shuchat Schwartz, who was a truly inspiring role model as Rebbetzin of our Kehila during the tenure of her husband, Rabbi J. Yaacov Schwartz. Her warmth, optimism, vibrant spirit and deep devotion to our community will never be forgotten. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to her husband, daughter Ayala, parents Rabbi Wilfred and Miriam Shuchat, sister Margola, brother Rafi, sister Bryna, our beloved member, and brother-inlaw Joshua Landes, our Vice President.
