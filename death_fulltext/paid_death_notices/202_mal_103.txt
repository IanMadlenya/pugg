        KOTLER--Martin, 78, who oversaw ground - breaking public service programs in New York City and was the Chairman of the Board of Macro International died of complications from nonHodgkins lymphoma on November 6 in Maryland. Under Mayor Wagner, he was Director of Job Development for JOIN and was Deputy Director of the Anti-Poverty Program. Under Mayor Lindsay, he was Deputy Commissioner of the Addiction Services Agency, a seminal force in creating therapeutic communities and group therapy. As Chairman of the Board at Macro, he worked closely with Federal Agencies, such as NIDA, CDC, HHS, NIH, and the White House Special Action Office for Drug Abuse. Survived by his wife Ruth, a daughter Laura Kotler Klein and son-in-law Robert Klein. He was a great guy!
        KOTLER--Martin. The Board of Palladia, Inc., formerly Project Return Foundation, notes with great sadness the passing of Martin Kotler. As Deputy Commissioner of the Addiction Services Agency, he was responsible for the initial funding for our agency in 1968-69. As a private citizen, he served as a consultant (gratis) for several years. In the 1980's, he became a member of the Board, commuting to New York from Washington, D.C. for each meeting. A friend, a colleague, a larger than life presence, he will be sorely missed. Dr. Judith D. Wallach, Chair, Board of Directors Jane Velez, President
