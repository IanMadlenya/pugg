        MILES--Philip. Love forever to Philip Miles, adoring husband of Estelle, incredible father, outrageous grandfather, dearest friend to so many. One of the greatest, dynamic press agents defining an era all but gone. From big bands (Artie Shaw, and many others) to '40's movies (MGM) to the heydays of Restaurant Associates in the '50s and Loews Hotels in the '60s. Died comfortably but without a vodka martini, near his home in Monroe Township, NJ on Tuesday, December 13. Missed by his children Seymour and Meredith, grandchildren Richard, Audrey, Anna and Rose and legions of his extended family who he cherished, and took in as his own. Services to be held on Thursday 11 A.M. at A.S. Cole, Cranbury, NJ.
