        HOCHBERG-Barbara P. The officers, trustees and staff of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee express their deep sorrow at the loss of Barbara Hochberg, devoted member of the JDC Board and beloved wife to Larry. She was deeply dedicated to meeting the needs of World Jewry and of the State of Israel with a special concern for children. She was also involved since the earliest days in the struggle to free Soviet Jewry. Barbara, who was Chairman of the Board of the Jewish Federation of Chicago, served as Chair of the JDC Ralph I. Goldman Fellowship Committee as well as Co-Chair of the JDC Israel Area Committee. We extend our deepest sympathies to her family. Jonathan W. Kolker, President Michael Schneider, Exec VP Ambassador Milton A. Wolf, Chairman of the Board
