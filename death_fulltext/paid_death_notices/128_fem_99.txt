        MENOWITZ-Nina. A loving wife, mother, grandmother and friend, all who knew her will never forget how vividly she touched our lives. Rarely does there come along a woman with so many wonderful qualities as Nina. Intelligence, honesty, and courage were only some of the outstanding virtues possessed by this unique individual. Undaunted and uncomplaining to the very end, Nina remained the eternal optimist throughout her long and trying illness. Her charm and wit, and most of all her compassion and love will remain in our hearts forever. The family of Harold Menowitz, husband of Nina Menowitz, wish to express our sincerest gratitude to all her many friends who have so generously expressed their deepest sympathy and kindness during this lengthly illness.
