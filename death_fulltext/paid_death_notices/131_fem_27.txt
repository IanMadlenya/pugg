        CANTOR-Josef Alexander. We express our Kos Tanchumim to Irene Cantor on the passing of her beloved hushand, Josef. As Founders of the Medical Center and supporters of the Jesselson Heart Center, their participation has helped to provide comprehensive, state-of-the-art cardiac care to the people of Jerusalem. May Mrs. Cantor, her daughter Esther and their family have warm and loving memories of a very special and caring individual. May they be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. American Committee for Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem Mrs. Erica Jesselson, Chairperson of the Board Menno Ratzker, President Dr. Stuart Tauber, Exec. Dir.
