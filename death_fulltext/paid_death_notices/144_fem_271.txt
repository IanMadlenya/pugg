        BONFELD-Adele. Beloved mother of Lowell, of blessed memory, doting grandmother of Mara and Marc, affectionate mother-in-law of Harriet, steadfast wife, daughter, sister, and aunt, she was truly a woman of valor.
        BONFELD-Adele. Aunt Adele persevered, carrying on despite the tragic loss of her beloved son Lowell. She was blessed by the remarkable love lavished upon her by her daughter-in-law Harriet, and by her grandchildren Mara and Marc. She was a second mother to sisters Tauby, z''l, and Belle and the caring matriarch of the Schreier family. Rabbi Stephen C. Lerner & Family
