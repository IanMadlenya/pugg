        GOLDSTEIN - Joseph. The trustees and staff of the Vera Institute of Justice are deeply saddened by the loss of our board member, Joseph Goldstein. Since 1966, Professor Goldstein provided wise counsel in a wide range of areas, including innovations in criminal justice and improvements in the lives of foster children. He was also noteworthy for encouraging staff as they planned and developed projects. We shall miss him, and extend our deepest sympathies to his family. Frederick A.O. Schwarz, Jr., Chair Christopher Stone, President
