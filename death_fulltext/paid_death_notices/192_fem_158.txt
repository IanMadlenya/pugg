        GINSBERG - Pearl. Boys Town Jerusalem mourns the passing of a most cherished friend of its extended family. Together with her late husband, Al, an esteemed member of our Board of Directors and its Executive Committee, Pearl identified with Boys Town's mission of helping disadvantaged Israeli youth receive a quality education enabling them to emerge as the builders and leaders of Israel. The Ginsbergs understood the importance of a combined Torah/Technology curriculum built on a foundation of values and care and concern for their fellow human beings. They expressed their commitment to these lofty ideals through their establishment and continued support of the Al and Pearl Ginsberg Scholarship Endowment Fund. The individual and collective achievements of Boys Town's students past, present and future will endure as a most meaningful legacy. We extend heartfelt condolences to Liane, Larry, Hilary, and the entire family. Rabbi Moshe Linchner, Dean Josh S. Weston, Honorary Chairman Raphael Benaroya, Chairman Michael J. Scharf, President Rabbi Ronald L. Gray, Executive V.P.
