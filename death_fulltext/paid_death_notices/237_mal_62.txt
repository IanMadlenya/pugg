        MARCUS--David. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) mourn the loss of David Marcus of Chicago, a decades long supporter with vision and dedication to the ATS, the Technion and Israel. Mr. Marcus was a stalwart of our Chicago Chapter, where he served on the Board during the 1980s and 1990s, including as chapter president. He also served on the national Board of Directors and was an active leader of the Investment Committee. Mr. and Mrs. Marcus supported numerous vital Technion projects including the Norman and Helen Asher Space Research Institute, the Chicago Chapter Organic Chemistry Laboratory and the Chicago Chapter Computer Centers Project. Mr. Marcus' devotion was recognized in 2002 with an Albert Einstein Award, the highest honor the ATS bestows. We extend our sincere sympathy to David's wife, Susan, his daughter Miriam Nirenberg, sons Bruce and Steve Marcus, and the entire Marcus family. American Society for Technion-Israel Institute of Technology Joan Seidel, President Stephen A. Laser, Chairman of the Board Melvyn H. Bloom, Executive Vice President David Rappaport, Chicago Chapter President Richard Zelin, West Central Region Director
