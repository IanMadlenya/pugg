        MOUNTAIN--John D., MD. We note with great sorrow the death of John D. Mountain, MD, an extraordinary clinician, surgeon, teacher and humanist. In 1953, Dr. Mountain became one of the first surgeons at the newly opened North Shore Hospital in Manhasset, NY, which was then a 169-bed community hospital. He helped the hospital establish a teaching residency program in surgery, allied with the Cornell Surgical Division of Bellevue Hospital. With Dr. Mountain's continued assistance over the years, it grew into a highly regarded surgical graduate medical education program and North Shore became a 788bed tertiary hospital recognized as one of the best in the nation. Dr. Mountain, who remained active at the hospital until a few years ago, was deeply involved in the development of the hospital's emergency dept and Schwartz Ambulatory Surgical Pavilion. We will always remember his enduring wisdom and wise counsel. We offer our sincere condolences to his family. Dennis Dowling Executive Director North Shore Univ. Hospital Martin Edelstein, MD President, Medical Staff North Shore Univ. Hospital
