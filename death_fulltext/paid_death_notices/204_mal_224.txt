        MATERA--Arthur. Kevin McKenzie, the dancers and staff of American Ballet Theatre mourn the passing of Arthur Matera, a leading force in American theater. As founder of Barbara Matera, Ltd., along with his beloved wife Barbara, Arthur served the theater and dance community for over 40 years. His passion and focus never dimmed during his work on countless ABT productions. We shall miss you, Arthur.
