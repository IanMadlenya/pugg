        DIAMOND-Edwin. Dean Philip Furmanski and his colleagues at the faculty of Arts and Science at New York University mourn the passing of our respected friend and energetic teacher Edwin Diamond. He will be particularly missed by his fellow practitioners in the Department of Journalism and Mass Communication, where he helped to establish a tradition of media criticism and analysis. The faculty notes his passing with profound sadness but knows his students will carry on with the memory of his many achievements. Our condolences are extended to his wife Adelina and Ed's entire family. A memorial service will be held at NYU on September 6.
