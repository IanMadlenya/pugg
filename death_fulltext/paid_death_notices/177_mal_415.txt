        BONIME-Walter, M.D. The American Academy of Psychoanalysis mourns the loss of a Fellow of especially high regard. His esteemed writings remain but his warm comradery and his rich presentations will be sorely missed. He was among us from the beginning, and he helped form the character of the Academy. We extend heartfelt condolence to his family. Matthew Tolchin, M.D. President Cesar Alfonso, M.D. Secretary
