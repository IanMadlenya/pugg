        HARRIS-Harriet Wisniewski, M.D. The Medical Staff of Saint Vincents Hospital expresses profound sorrow on the passing of a longtime colleague, distinguished physician and friend. Dr. Wisniewski joined our medical staff in 1960 in the Department of Radiology. She served our patients and her Department with distinction, developing the Pediatric Radiology Section which she chaired until her retirement. Dr. Wisniewski served as President of the Medical Staff from 1981 to 1982, the only woman so honored in the 150-year history of our hospital. Dr. Wisniewski was a gifted physician, an outstanding educator and a true role model for the four generations of physicians she trained. Dr. Wisniewski radiated kindness, dignity and true intellect. The Saint Vincents family has lost a valued friend. We extend our heartfelt condolences to her sons Mark and David Harris and to her sister-inlaw Florence Harris. Joseph M. Jabbour, M.D. President, Medical Board Saint Vincents Hospital & Medical Center of NY
