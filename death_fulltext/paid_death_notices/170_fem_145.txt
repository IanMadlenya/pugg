        RETTER-Betty (nee Rosenblatt). The bright star of our family. Mourned deeply by Marcus Retter, Daniel and Margie, Allan and Brocha, David and Elky; her grandchildren and great-grandchildren, all of whom she cherished dearly; and by her loving sisters, Mary Schreiber, Margot Pollak, Leah Eisenberg and their families. May her zest for life, her gallantry and her indomitable spirit continue to inspire us.
