        POST -- Jeannette. Beloved wife of Dr. Bernard Post (deceased); mother, great grandmother, twin sister of Israel M. Dolgin, aunt, great aunt, devoted friend. Her life's accomplishments are numerous; an attorney for nearly 70 years at a time when women weren't readily accepted, president of numerous civic and philanthropic organizations, a voice always to be listened to with admiration and respect. But her greatest and most lasting legacy to all who follow was her incredible devotion to family. She led by example, she was a Shepherd who made sure that her flock was never separated. She was surrounded by over 60 members of this extended family at her joint 90th party just two months ago; what a joyous memory! She truly will always be remembered as ''The leader of the Pack.'' May her memory be a blessing and inspiration. Kalmon & Peggy Dolgin, Joshua & Rebecca; Daniel; Brynn, Alan & Emma Klein
