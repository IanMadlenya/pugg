        BIDDLE--David., M.D. The Department of Neurology and the Staff Society of the Long Island Jewish Medical Center mourn the loss of our dear and respected colleague, Dr. David Biddle. Dr. Biddle has been an integral part of the department and staff for nearly 34 years. He first came to Long Island Jewish Medical Center in 1970 as an intern. He completed his Neurology Residency under Dr. Morton Nathanson, who held him in the highest regards for the next three decades. Dr. Biddle held numerous clinical and administrative positions in the department and medical center, including Staff Society President, but most importantly, he was recognized for his unfailing clinical dedication and devotion to the teaching of residents. Even as illness sapped his strength, he maintained an active role in caring for his patients and nurturing the neurological careers of house officers and junior faculty. His brilliance and intense spirit had an impact on many, and will forever remain alive for, and through his wife Trisha and his two children, Erika and Jeremy. A memorial will be held at The Village Club, at Lake Success, 318 Lakeville Road on Sunday, March 28, from 12:002:00 PM. As per Dr. Biddle's wishes, in lieu of flowers or food, contributions in his memory may be made to The Dr. David Biddle Wish Fund. Eugene Friedman, M.D., Pres Randall Feingold, M.D. VP Glenn Faust, M.D., Secretary Angelo Reppucci, M.D. Treas
