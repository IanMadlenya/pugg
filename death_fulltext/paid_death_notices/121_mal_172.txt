        HESSEL-Alexander. The Board of Trustees, President David Chang, Chancellor George Bugliarello, the faculty, alumni, staff and students of Polytechnic University note with profound sorrow the passing of Alexander Hessel, retired professor of the Electrical Engineering Department. After receiving his doctorate at Polytechnic, Professor Hessel served on the University's faculty for more than thirty years, and was deeply admired and loved both by his colleagues and by the graduate students who worked with him. In the field of electromagnetic theory, he was one of the world's foremost experts in microwave phased array antennas for military radar applications. We extend heartfelt condolences to his wife, Miriam Hessel, and family.
