        KATZ--Murray S. The Officers, Board and staff of American ORT mourn the passing of Murray S. Katz, who, together with his beloved wife, Natalie, graced this organization with his deep commitment and generosity for over three decades. Murray served American ORT as both a Vice-President and Assistant Secretary. In 1989 he received the Organization's most prestigious award, ''The William Haber Award'' and last year, he and Natalie were honored with the ''Yitzhak Rabin Award,'' given in recognition of outstanding dedication to ORT schools worldwide. They are members of the ORT 1880 Society, an exclusive international major donor group. We will miss Murray's humor, loving spirit and vision. Our heartfelt sympathy to Natalie, his nieces, nephews, grand nieces and cousins. Joe Cohen, President Robert L. Sill, Board Chair Paul B. Firstenberg, Exec Dir American ORT
