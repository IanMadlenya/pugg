        ADLER-Kurt A. M.D. Ph.D The Department of Psychiatry expresses its profound sadness on the death of its esteemed member, Kurt A. Adler, MD, Ph.D. Dr. Adler was Emeritius Associate Psychiatrist on the voluntary medical staff of Lenox Hill Hospital and ably served this institution since 1947. A wise and vital man up to the time of his death, Dr. Adler was a Life Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association and President of the Board of Directors of the Advanced Institute for Analytic Psychotherapy. Dr. Adler was mentor to several Chiefs of Service and to the Director of this Department, and could always be relied upon to provide incisive and wise counsel. All of us in the Department shall very much miss Kurt. He was one of a kind. Allen H. Collins, MD, MPH Director Joseph P.
