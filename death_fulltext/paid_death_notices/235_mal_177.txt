        GRAY--Julius of Ninevah Beach, Sag Harbor, New York died on August 11, 2006 at his home. He was 93 years of age. Mr. Gray received his high school diploma from the distinguished Kittrell College in North Carolina. A 1938 graduate of Lincoln University, Pennsylvania he went on to earn a Master's Degree in Science from Brooklyn College, New York. He was a Senior Founding Member of the East End's Noyac Golf and Country Club. He was also a long term member of the Comus Club of Brooklyn, New York and a member of Sigma Pi Phi fraternity. He was married in 1960 to the late Hazel Shearer Thomas, well-known educator, club woman and member of a prominent Martha's Vineyard family. The Grays were active in the Ninevah Beach community. For the last two years of Mr. Gray's life, he had his daily dinner at the American Hotel on Main Street in Sag Harbor. When he was no longer able to drive, the hotel sent a car and driver to deliver his meal. A boating enthusiast to the very end, Julius Gray, affectionately called ''Footz'' by his close friends, could often be seen sailing his thirty-foot sloop in the surrounding waters. He is survived by a niece, Julia Wilson Patterson and grand nephew, Earl Gray, both of Virginia. As requested by Mr. Gray there will be no funeral, but he will be remembered fondly by all those whose lives were touched by this elegant man whose life defined the word ''gentleman.''
