        PALM-Michael. The Board of Directors of the Eos Orchestra and Jonathan and Sheffer Artistic Director, mourn the loss of our dear friend and fellow director Michael Palm. As a founding contributor to the Eos Orchestra his generosity to our concerts and publications was exemplary, and inspired others through philanthropic example. We will remember fondly his passion for music, his love of ideas and his joy for all things fresh and innovative.
