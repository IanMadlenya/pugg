        BOWDEN--Paula Laurence. Tonight on her birthday, friends will celebrate the extraordinary life of one of the last of the great Broadway babies. Making her debut in 1936 as Orson Welles teenaged leading lady in his ''Horse Eats Hat'' and ''Doctor Faustus,'' Paula created featured roles in the original productions of ''Junior Miss,'' ''Something for the Boys,'' ''One Touch of Venus,'' ''Season in the Sun'' and ''Ivanov,'' among a dozen more Broadway shows. A ''Dark Shadows'' TV stint was one quirky facet of a near-70-year career that included countless regional, stock, cabaret and concert appearances. Her favorite role for more than 40 years was as a wife to the late producer--manager Charles Bowden. A longtime contributor to Playbill and Vogue, Paula was for decades an ardent supporter of New Dramatists. A life-long New Yorker, a devoted friend to her peers and the spiritual godmother of many artists, Paula remained a vital personality until she exited this world on October 29.
