        TECLAFF--Ludwik A. Fordham University School of Law records with profound sorrow the death of Professor Emeritus Ludwik A. Teclaff, former director of the Fordham Law Library (1963-1986). A Polish diplomat and noted authority on international law and water law, his gentle manner will always be remembered. We extend our deep sympathy to his wife, Eileen.
