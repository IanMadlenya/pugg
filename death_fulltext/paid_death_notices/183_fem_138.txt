        BEISSEL-Amy. Born November 18, 1944, died suddenly on the morning of April 12, 2002, in New York City.

She left to accompany her husband on his assignments to Geneva and Vienna. When they returned after several years abroad, she continued to play an active role in the organization. Her husband, Denis, is the Director of Operations for the Human Resources Office of the United Nations. She is survived by her husband Denis, her parents Charles and Ruth Batterman, her brother Henry Batterman and her sister Nora Campbell, her daughters Ann Pollak, Grace Rice and Sarah Beissel, and her granddaughter Anastasia Pollak.
