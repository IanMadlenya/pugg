        ANGELILLI--Joan. In loving memory of Joan Angelilli. I will always remember the wonderful three hour Sunday dinners. Gravy with spareribs, meatballs & bracciole and the best leg of lamb ever. I will remember her adorning the lobby of the Americana Hotel in Puerto Rico with her beautiful elegance. I will most remember that at all times she made me feel like a second son. My life was enriched for having known her and I will miss her always. Richie
