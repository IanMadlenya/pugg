        COHEN-Shyka. Beloved son, brother, uncle, gallery owner and real estate developer died on Wednesday, March 10, in New York City. He was 47 years old. Born and raised in Tel Aviv, Israel, he immigrated to the United States in 1973 after serving in the Israeli army. He studied fine art, his love, at the Maryland Institute College of Art and moved to New York in 1977 to study architecture and design. He designed and renovated many residential and commercial spaces in Manhattan and eventually formed his own company to develop and restore city properties. Fine art remained his first love. In 1996, after a long fight with cancer during which he received a kidney from his mother, he opened the Ice Gallery, dedicated to promoting non-conceptual 20th Century art. He sponsored several artists whose work represented what he considered to be traditional values, and he worked with the Maryland Institute College of Art to begin an exchange program for art students in the United States and Israel. His mother, Elizabeth Dagani-Cohen, and a brother, Eitan Cohen, survive him. Both reside in Tel Aviv. Mr. Cohen will be interred at the Mount of Olives Cemetery in Israel. Friends may pay their last respects at a memorial service to be held at the Ice Gallery on Monday, March 15 at 7:30 PM. In lieu of flowers, contributions in his memory to the Kidney Foundation of New York would be appreciated.
