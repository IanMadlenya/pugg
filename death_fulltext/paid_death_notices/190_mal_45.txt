        MILTENBERG-Herman. 97 years young, our dearly departed friend and confidant whom was admired and respected by all, passed away on November 3, 2002. Words cannot express this man's generosity and caring for everyone and everything he touched. Morally and ethically perfect, he was successful both in business and in life. The patriarch of a large extended family there are too many people to name as his loved ones and those he mentored. He always ''complained'' on October 3rd, his birthday, that he had spent all day on the phone with people who were calling to send their love. He had a heart of gold and a mind saturated with knowledge, melodies and advice. Herman goes to spend time with his wife, Adi, whom he loved so much. You had a good life. We will miss you so much.
