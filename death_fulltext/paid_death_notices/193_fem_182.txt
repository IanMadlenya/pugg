        HOLZER-Nina S. Barry. Beloved wife of Michael, loving and devoted daughter of Frances and Ralph, loving stepmother to Adam and Michele, Lara and Adam, adoring grandmother of Benjamin, wonderful teacher, friend and confidant. She walked with beauty, courage, dignity, intelligence, strength and integrity-qualities that will continue to inspire and enrich those who have been touched by her. She will be sorely missed.
