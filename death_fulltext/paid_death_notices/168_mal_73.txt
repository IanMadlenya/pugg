        ROGERS-William P. Cornell University mourns the loss of a distinguished graduate of its Law School and an exemplary public servant, William P. Rogers. Throughout a remarkable career that embraced a successful private legal practice and government service at the highest levels under Presidents Eisenhower, Nixon, and Reagan, he brought honor to his alma mater. A man of impeccable ethical standards, he became a champion of civil rights and freedom of the press, his actions helped shape the fabric of American life in the second half of the 20th century. At the Cornell Law School Library he met Adele Langston, a fellow law student who would become his wife. He and his family honored Mrs. Rogers by naming the Adele Langston Rogers Atrium and Teaching Wing in Cornell's Lincoln Hall. He served Cornell as a Presidential Councillor, a member of the Law School Advisory Council, and former President of the Cornell Law School Association. The Cornell community will miss his friendship, loyalty, and kindness. We express our sincere condolences to William Roger's wife, Cornell trustee emerita, Adele Langston Rogers, and their children Anthony, Jeffrey, Douglas Rogers and Dale Rogers Marshall, also a trustee emerita of Cornell University. Harold Tanner, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, Cornell University Hunter R. Rawlings, III President, Cornell University
