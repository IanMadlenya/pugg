        MAGLARAS--Nicholas G. The Lambos Firm mourns the sudden passing of its partner, Nicholas G. Maglaras. Nick was a highly-skilled and dedicated practitioner of law. He will be sorely missed by all who worked with him. Our sympathies go to his parents, George and Angelica Maglaras, his sister and brother-inlaw, Linda M. and Peter Alimaras, his nephew and niece, Steven and Anastasia, and his god-daughter, Alexandra Anagnostos.
