        KAPLAN-Dr. Robert. The Department of Dental Medicine of the Long Island Jewish Medical Center, now part of the North Shore Long Island Jewish Health System, records with sorrow the passing of Dr. Robert Kaplan, former Chief of the Periodontics Division, the position of which he held with dignity and expertise for many years. Both his colleagues on the staff, and the many residents who passed through the system over the years, were the recipients of the knowledge, compassion and enthusiasm fully expected of a Diplomate of the American Board of Periodontics. He will be sorely missed. Ron Burakoff, D.D.S. Chrmn. Dept. of Dental Medicine LI Jewish Medical Center
