        HOFFMANN-Doris Goodday, 94. Died April 23, 2002 with the same profound dignity and grace with which she lived.

Survived by heartbroken daughter Deborah Hoffmann of Oakland, CA., and son Laurence Hoffmann of Claremont, CA. Donations in her memory made be made to Bat Shalom, P.O. Box 8083, Jerusalem, 91080 Israel or to Family Caregiver Alliance, 690 Market St, #
