        ROSENBAUM--Aaron. We offer our Kos Tanchumim to the entire Rosenbaum family. Aaron was a generous man whose open hand epitomized the highest standards of Jewish values. Condolences to our Diamond Founders Doctor Belle and Rabbi Jacob Rosenbaum on the loss of his brother and to Aaron's wife Rosalind and children, Anne Senter, Ester Scharf, Rabbi Yitzchak and Rabbi Yehuda Rosenbaum. May the family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
