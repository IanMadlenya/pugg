        GOLDRING-Helen. We are very saddened to learn of the passing of Helen Goldring, the beloved mother of our esteemed Professor Roberta Goldring Coles and the wonderful spouse of our late Professor William Goldring, both in the Department of Medicine at NYU School of Medicine. Helen Goldring was an alumna of the NYU School of Law (1928). She was a unique woman who combined professionalism with the leadership of a very special family. Helen was the pillar of strength who guided and supported the outstanding careers of the late William, who was a highly regarded leading clinical investigator in hypertension and renal disease, and Roberta, who is an acclaimed, productive and respected clinician, investigator and teacher in pulmonary physiology, pathophysiology, and disease. Helen was the special role model who pursued excellence and made the name Goldring synonymous with excellence. She was the very proud and supportive spouse, mother, grandmother and great-grandmother. She was the finest of the fine. We owe her a great deal for providing us with unique members of our alumni and faculty. She was the spouse of William; mother of Roberta and the late Nancy; mother-in-law of the late Dr. Robert Coles of our faculty and an alumnus of our School of Medicine (1945); grandmother of Deputy Mayor Anthony, John, an accomplished movie director, and sister, Dr. Nancy Coles Goldstein of our faculty, special alumnae (1985) and member of our Board of Governors; and great-grandmother of eight wonderful great-grandchildren. We express our deep sympathy to the entire family. Saul J. Farber, M.D., M.A.C.P. The Frederick H. King Professor & Chairman, Department of Medicine
