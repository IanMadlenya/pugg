        KINNEAR-Mary. A loyal and dedicated alumna and former member of the Board of Trustees of The Ethel Walker School. Her commitment, enthusiasm and deep caring for the School will be greatly missed by all who knew and worked with her. She is part of a great family tradition of Walker's women including two great aunts, several cousins and her two daughters Robin Anderson and Susan Neul. Our deepest sympathies go to her husband Jim and their entire family. Margot Ross Rose, '80, President of the Board
