        WALLER--Herbert, on January 6, 2005. Beloved husband of the late Sandie Waller. Beloved father of Dr. Scott Waller, Keith Waller, and Donna Waller-Maggio. Beloved father-in-law of Lisa DreznickWaller, Esq., Robin WallachWaller, and Jerry Maggio. Beloved Papa to Courtney and Benjamin, and Poppy to Brittany and Brooke. Beloved brother of Seth Waller, Esq. An outstanding athlete, he was in the Brooklyn Dodger's farm system at a time when players played for the love of the game. At his parents' request for him to pursue higher education, he gave up his dream of a career in professional baseball to graduate from CCNY where he was point guard for Nat Holman's powerhouse basketball team. A respected business executive in the cosmetics industry throughout his life, he started his business career at Grey Advertising, subsequently moving on to a vice president position at Estee Lauder, and then to president of the cosmetics division of Sterling Drugs. Ironically, having built his career on his intellectual capabilities, he fell victim to severe Alzheimer's disease at a tragically young age. He will always be remembered for his sharp mind, keen business sense and ongoing love of sports. He will be sorely missed by all those who knew and loved him. Services will be held Sunday, January 9 at 9:30AM at Riverside Memorial Chapels, 1450 Broadway, Hewlett, NY. For shiva information call 646-831-7807
