        STOLIAR-Joan. The Board of Directors of Theodore Gordon Flyfishers deeply mourns the passing of longtime Board member Joan Stoliar. Joan was the lightning rod and driving force behind TGF's Trout in the Classroom Program, which brought an awareness of the importance of a healthy aquatic environment to both New York City and New York State schoolchildren. Her guiding hand and generous heart will be missed by her schools of children and schools of fish. We extend our heartfelt condolences to her husband and champion, Arthur, and the entire Stoliar family. David Berman, President
