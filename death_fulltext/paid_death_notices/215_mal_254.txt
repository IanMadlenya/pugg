        RIELO--Fernando, Founder of the Idente Missionaries. Dr. Fernando Rielo Pardal, founder of the Idente Missionaries, died approximately 10 p.m. on Monday, December 6, 2004, at the age of 81. He expired surrounded by the members of one of his religious communities in the City of New York, where he had been residing for purposes of medical treatment since 1988. Although the great physical suffering which marked his last years gradually exhausted his vital energy, he kept a lucid mind until the end. We, his spiritual sons and daughters, have constantly received strength from his fragility. He has left us the inheritance of his passionate love for the Most Blessed Trinity, his profound sense of being a son of the Church, and a heart merciful towards all. Dr. Rielo was born in Madrid in 1923. On June 29, 1959, in Tenerife (Spain), he founded a Catholic religious institute, the Institute Id of Christ the Redeemer, Idente Missionaries, canonically recognized as an Institute of Consecrated Life with missions in 25 countries in Europe, America, Asia and Africa. He promoted several non-profit religious, cultural and scientific organizations: the Idente School; the Fernando Rielo Foundation, best known for the annual World Prize for Mystical Poetry; and the Idente Youth Association. His cultural creativity, based on his metaphysical, theological and literary meditations, has given rise to numerous written works, many of which are as yet unpublished. At this time, when grief over his absence and joy over his his absence and joy over his arrival in our Father's House go hand in hand, we send our heartfelt thanks for your prayers for his eternal rest and for the spiritual growth of the enterprise he has entrusted to us.
