        STANDEN-Edith. The Trustees and Staff of the Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn with affection and deep sadnees the passing of their respected colleague and friend, Edith Standen, who was Curator Emeritus of the Department of European Sculpture and Decorative Arts, and a renowned and prolific tapestry historian. She was in charge of the Textile Study Room from 1949 until her retirement in 1970, and continued to devote herself to her research on tapestries of the Renaissance and later periods, arriving at the Museum early each morninginto her 93rd year-to work in the Watson Library. She was a familiar and respected presence, and a determined and prolific scholar who will be greatly missed. Philippe de Montebello, Director
