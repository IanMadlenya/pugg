        RIBNER--Betty T. A previous notice of the passing of Betty T. Ribner inadvertently omitted that she was survived by her sister, Libbie TuckRosenberg. The family apologizes for this omission. We also take this opportunity to thank and honor Aunt Libbie for her generous support of the family and the community, especially for Jewish Family Service of LA.
