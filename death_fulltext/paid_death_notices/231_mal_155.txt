        NEWMAN--Howard A. The Directors, Officers and staff of The Jewish Guild for the Blind deeply mourn the death of Howard A. Newman, esteemed colleague and former Board Chairman, Board Member and a lifelong Guild supporter. He carried forward the tradition of the Newman family, notably his father Jerome, mother Estelle, and step-mother Elizabeth, all of whom were major supporters of The Guild. The family's commitment to helping people who are blind and visually impaired has been characterized by extraordinary generosity. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to his wife, Maria, and the entire Newman family. Pauline Raiff, Bd. Chairman Alan R. Morse, Pres. & CEO
