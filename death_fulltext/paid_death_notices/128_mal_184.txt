        FLEDELL-Joseph. You can't stop the rain from raining. You can't quarrel with fate. For everything there's a season. A time to be born, a time to live, and a time to die. There is nothing unusual about a funeral or an unveiling, except that this time it's yours, Sweetheart. I console myself by trying to believe that God needed you to be on the welcoming committee for lovely Princess Diana and the blessed angel Mother Teresa. He knew your love for entertainment, mainly singing. Allan Correli, Ed Sullivan's talent scout, said he never heard our national anthem sung with such perfection and feeling, and he arranged to have you sing at the Salute to the Wounded in Madison Square Garden (the old one). I was your Jewish American Princess. You will forever and ever be my Prince Charming. From the day I saw you, Memorial Day weekend 1927, at the Idyl Hour Hotel in Pleasantdale, NJ, I was born again. My life really began. I couldn't take my eyes off you. Would I do it again? You bet I would! Hasta La Vista, Baby. I wuve you until eternity. Betty
