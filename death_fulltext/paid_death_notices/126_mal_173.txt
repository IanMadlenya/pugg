        GELARDIN-Hugo J. The Marymount School Board of Trustees, administration and entire School community mourn the death of our beloved colleague and founding Trustee, Hugo J. Gelardin. Since 1969 he provided vision, financial expertise and guidance which were instrumental in the growth of the School. Hugo J. Gelardin provided strong leadership during his tenure as President and played a significant role in developing the fund raising initiatives of the School while serving as Chairman of the Development Committee. His wise counsel, intelligence, style, dedication, and his love of poetry will be missed by all of us. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Cordula, and his children, Christine and Nicole, Marymount School alumnae, and his entire family. Kathleen Fagan, RSHM Headmistress
