        GOLDBERG-Martin. It is with profound sorrow that the Mishpacha Zalman Society records the death of Founding member Martin Goldberg. Uncle Marty, together with his beloved wife of blessed memory Aunt Jeanette, was a stalwart of our organization for more than half a century. He was a man of rare intellect and keen wit, and will be sorely missed by those of us who were privileged to know and love him.
