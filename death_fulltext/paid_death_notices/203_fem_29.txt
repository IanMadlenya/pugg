        GEEN--Renee. The Barnard College community grieves for the loss of its long time faculty member, Professor Renee Geen, an inspiring and generous teacher of French for nearly 50 years. Professor Geen was an admired and devoted member of our community who will be greatly missed. In addition to her dedication to teaching, she joined three colleagues as an author of a key French grammar and literary text, which was adopted by leading colleges in the country. A memorial service will be held on the Barnard campus in the Spring semester. We extend our condolences to her husband, Stanley Geen, her children, and other family members and friends. Elizabeth S. Boylan Provost and Dean of the Faculty Barnard College
