        SIEGEL--Leonard I. We are deeply saddened by the death of Leonard Siegel, on November 6, 2006. He leaves a lifetime of memories that will keep his spirit alive in the minds of his large, loving family. Leonard Siegel's 59year marriage to Lee Honig Siegel was a partnership of mutual love and respect. He was proud of his four children and their spouses, his nine grandchildren and five greatgrandchildren-and enjoyed comparing this brood with his early years as an only child. Professionally, Leonard Siegel played a significant role in the growth of the fashion industry in the United States. As a principle in Anglo Fabrics Co, Inc., he helped create a domestic market of couture fabrics used by the world's top fashion designers. Mr. Siegel served on the Board of Trustees of the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT), and was a member of a number of key committees. Johanna Farms, which grew from a small New Jersey dairy into a major food corporation, benefited from the expertise of Leonard Siegel. Leonard Siegel leaves a legacy of warmth and intellectual challenge and accomplishment to his wife, Lee, their children; David, Robert, Ellen, and Michael, their nine grandchildren; Andrew, Jonathan, Becky, Amy, Emily, Jain, Anne, Karen, and Rachel; and great-grandchildren; Samantha, Juliet, Nathaniel, Jacob, and Oliver.
