        NEISSER-Eric. The staff, the board, and the members of the American Civil Liberties Union mourn the passing of Eric Neisser, dean and president of Franklin Pierce Law Center and longtime friend and colleague of the ACLU. Eric devoted his entire professional life to defending the rights of the most vulnerable among us. He was a formidable litigator, a brilliant constitutional scholar, and a kind and generous mentor. We will miss him sorely.
