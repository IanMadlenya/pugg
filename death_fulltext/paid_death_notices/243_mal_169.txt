        SUSSMAN--Morris, on April 5. Entrepreneur and philanthropist. A leader in the cosmetic packaging industry founding two firms: Shore Plastics and Cadview Technologies. He was discreetly generous to both organized charities and his friends, while mentoring a large number of colleagues. Loving husband, father, and grandfather. He is sorely missed by those whose lives he touched, but remains a powerful influence on those who knew him.
