        BAER-Rudolf L. The faculty, alumni, residents and staff of the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology, New York University, record with profound sorrow the death of Dr. Rudolf L. Baer, a faculty member from 1942 until 1997 and Chairman of our Department from 1961 to 1981. Rudy was a gifted, caring physician; an innovative, world-renowned scientist; an exemplary teacher; a leader who held high administrative positions in all of the major national and international dermatological organizations; and, most importantly, a true gentleman and loyal friend. Although he will be deeply missed, the generations of dermatologists whom he trained will ensure that the Baer tradition of excellence will survive. We offer our sincerest condolences to the members of his family, who have suffered so many recent painful losses. Irwin M. Freedberg, M.D. George Miller MacKee Professor and Chairman
