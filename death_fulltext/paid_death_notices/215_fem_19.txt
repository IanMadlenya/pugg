        MONROE--Laura. The American Civil Liberties Union mourns the passing of an esteemed colleague, Laura Monroe. Laura had a long career working for the ACLU and later, Greater Boston Legal Services, bringing her passion for civil liberties and economic justice to her clients, the ACLU and the City of Boston. Born in Germany in 1927, her family fled Nazi Germany and Occupied France for Brazil, finally settling in Cleveland, OH. The injustices of the McCarthy Era witch hunts had such a profound effect on Laura that she called the ACLU to volunteer to help the then-beleaguered organization stand against the hysteria of the times. She became the executive director of the ACLU of Ohio, one of the first women to head an ACLU affiliate, and then, development director of the ACLU of Southern California, eventually marrying its executive director, Eason Monroe. In 1979 she became the associate director of the ACLU of Northern California. After the death of her husband, she decided to become a lawyer and focus on economic justice, going on to serve the poor and elderly as an attorney for Greater Boston Legal Services. She served on the Board of Directors of the ACLU of Massachusetts and on the National ACLU Board of Directors and received numerous recognition awards.
