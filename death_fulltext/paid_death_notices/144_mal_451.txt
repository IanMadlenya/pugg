        LAZEAR-Robert Allen. Aged 75. Of West Hartford, Connecticut, and Cuttyhunk Island, Mass. Died on January 26th. ''Dean of New England Headmasters'' and ''Squire of Cuttyhunk,'' Bob Lazear lived a life devoted to education. He started his career as a history teacher at the Pomfret School in 1951, and in 1962 moved to Hampton Institute in Virginia as assistant to the President, dedicating the next several years to the Civil Rights movement. From 1967-1986 he was headmaster of the Kingswood-Oxford School. Upon his retirement, he served the Renbrook School and then the Mooreland Hill School as interim headmaster, Bob Lazear dared generations of young people to live life with gusto, introduced them to the world's joys, exposed them to the world's injustices, and incited students to fight for their beliefs with compassion as well as passion, wisdom as well as fire. He had a wonderful life and a beautiful voice, and was as likely to burst into a Gershwin lyric as he was to offer a hearty greeting. He is survived by his wife of 54 years, the former Dorothy Rector; by his daughters Barbara Lazear Ascher and Rebecca Lazear Okrent; sons-in-law Robert C. Ascher and Daniel Okrent; grandchildren Rebecca and Charles Ascher-Walsh, and John and Lydia Okrent; his brother, Thomas Lazear, & sister Margaret Weidaw. His son Robert Allen Lazear, Jr., died in 1989. A memorial service will be held on the Kingswood-Oxford campus on Saturday, February 6, at 5:00 PM, at Seaverns Hall.
