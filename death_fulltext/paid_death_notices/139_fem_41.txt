        MITCHELL-Jean Fair. On August 5, 1998 at the age of 88. The Brearley School community mourns the loss of our former Head of the School who served from 1947-1975. She will be remembered with respect and admiration for her wisdom and devotion to Brearley. In keeping with Miss Mitchell's wishes, there will be no funeral service, but there will be an appropriate occasion in the fall for her friends to pay tribute to her. Gifts in Miss Mitchell's memory may be made to the Jean Fair Mitchell Fund, a discretionary fund for the Head of the School, or to the Jean Fair Mitchell Scholarship Fund at The Brearley School, 610 East 83rd Street, New York, NY 10028.
