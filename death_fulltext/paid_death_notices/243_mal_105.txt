        GRAHAM--Colin. The entire Santa Fe Opera family mourns the death of Colin Graham, a friend and colleague. From 1973 through 2003 Mr. Graham was a dynamic presence in Santa Fe, directing some of the the company's most important works. His legacy is formidable and the opera community is richer for his presence. He will be greatly missed. Susan F. Morris, President Richard Gaddes, General Director The Santa Fe Opera
