        HUGHES-Frederick W. The Board of Directors and the staff of The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts mourn the death of Fred Hughes, who was a Founding Member of the Foundation's Board of Directors, its first president, its Chairman of the Board, and its Honorary Chairman. Fred Hughes brought imagination and intelligence to the creation of the Foundation, reflecting both his long, brilliant association with Andy Warhol and his own lively spirit and keen determination. We extend our deepest sympathies to his mother Jennie Hughes, his sister Mary-Beth Hansard, his brother Thomas Hughes and to their families. Fred Hughes was a good friend to many, and he will be missed by them and by all those whose lives he touched during his dynamic and successful career. Werner H. Kramarsky, Chairman of the Board Archibald L. Gillies, President
