        WILLIAMS-Ted. The President, Board of Trustees, staff and extended family of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and its fund raising arm the Jimmy Fund, mourn the passing of Ted Williams, baseball's most famous hitter in the Jimmy Fund's legendary supporter. For thousands of children with cancer, Mr. Williams provided hope and inspiration, both at Fenway Park and during his countless visits to the Jimmy Fund Clinic at Dana-Farber. His tireless advocacy and generosity on behalf of the clinic have contributed to great advances in cancer research and care. At the start of his work with the Jimmy Fund in 1953, almost every child with cancer died. Today, therapies for adults advance with unprecedented success, andnearly four out of five children with cancer survive. Mr. Williams had a dream to beat cancer. At Dana-Farber his spirit and dedication will forever inspire our work to make that vision a reality. Edward J. Benz Jr., M.D. President, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Michael J. Andrews, Chairman, The Jimmy Fund
