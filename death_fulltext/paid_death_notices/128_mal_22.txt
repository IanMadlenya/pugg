        KATZ-Mo. On August 31, 1997. A man of many parts. Enormously gifted in intellect, artistic in temperament, & forthright in manner, Mo Katz was a loving husband of Mary Jane Koren, a fiercely proud father of Zev and Ivon Katz and devoted grandfather of Nicholas Katz. He was a tenacious friend and mentor to many outside his family. A senior New York City hospital administrator for most of his professional career, Mo earned a national reputation as an industry leader. He was an unmitigated idealist, endowed with a keen sense of what was doable, and the intuitive ability to engage others in achieving it. Mo was most of all a humanist who loved to tell stories as a way of expressing the ironies & triumphs of daily living. He always made his point. His was a fearless spirit-one that animated us all. Memorial services will be held on Tuesday September 23 at 6PM at Riverside Memorial Chapel, Amsterdam Avenue & 76 St. In lieu of flowers contributions in his name may be made to Amnesty International, 322 8th Avenue, N.Y., N.Y. 10001.
        KATZ-Mo. A Senior Member of The Commonwealth Fund Staff for a decade, Mo was tireless in developing and supporting programs to help the most vulnerable in our society, from the frail elderly to the young. Experienced in policy planning and development, Mo Katz never lost sight of the true audience, the individuals who would be served. His contribution to The Fund went well beyond professional expertise. For The Fund's Staff and Grantees, Mo was a mentor to many, and a friend to all. He delighted in people, and they responded in kind. On behalf of The Board of Directors and Fund Staff, our most sincere condolences to his wife and family. Charles A. Sanders, M.D., Chairman The Commonwealth Fund Karen Davis, President The Commonwealth Fund
