        GURARY -- Rabbi Schnejer Zalman. His wife, children, grandchildren and greatgrandchildren note with sadness and profound loss the passing of our family patriarch. A shining light and formidable spirit, he will live on in our hearts and minds always. Rabbi Gurary's life was marked by an unparalleled devotion to the Lubavitcher Rebbes; indeed, it was while praying at their gravesites that he suffered cardiac arrest. He passed from this world a few hours later on the morning of Rosh HaShana 5764 corresponding to September 27th, 2003. His piety, fierce intellect, sparkling wit and love for his family were matched only by his myriad communal involvements and legendary philanthropy. May his memory be for a blessing.
