        BERNHARDT - Ruth Schonzeit, 101. Beloved mother of Helen Carr (deceased), Marcia Model, Lisa Leblang and Joyce Siegel, wife of the late New York State Supreme Court Justice Maurice Bernhardt, grandmother of ten loving grandchildren and sixteen great-grandchildren, on December 23. She moved to Maryland in 1989 after an active life in New York, where, among other achievements, she headed the Brooklyn Jewish Center Sisterhood and organized their WWII Red Cross Chapter. She was known for her skills at the piano, bringing joy to many people; for her role as a helpmate to Justice Bernhardt, representing him at public events, supporting his career and philanthropic activities; as an energetic summer camp head counselor; and as a devoted sister of eight Schonzeit siblings. She had a full, rich life and we, who love her, mourn our loss. The family will receive friends at the home of Marcia Model, 17-85 216th St., Apt. 10M, Bayside, NY, through Dec. 31. There will be a memorial service in Bethesda. In lieu of flowers the family requests donations be sent to: Ruth and Maurice Bernhardt Scholarship Fund, American ORT, 817 Broadway, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10003.
