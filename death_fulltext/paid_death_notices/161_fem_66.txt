        VISHNER-Esther Dobkin. 90, formerly of the Bronx, died May 22 under care of friends in Oxnard, CA. Illness only deprived Esther of her independence in her last two months. Esther didn't have an easy life, but no one would have known it. Her infectious laughter and positive outlook were a gift to all. A love of ''good dark choclate'' and yellow roses evidenced the joy she took in simple pleasures. She presented her family with a steady stream of lovingly crafted knitted garments. Esther was born in Waterbury,CT, earned her AB degree from Hunter College, did allergy research at Mt. Sinai and Brooklyn Jewish Hospitals and was the first to publish the pollen count in the New York Times. Later she helped her brothers at Pioneer Fence Co. In 1948 she married the late Joseph Vishnevetsky (changed to Vishner). She was active in the PTAs of P.S. 94, J.H.S. 80, Sholem Aleichem Shul 21, served on Local School Board 10 and with Sholem Aleichem Folk Institute. In WWII she was a volunteer ''tracker'' of air traffic. She was a member of Workmen's Circle, National Yiddish Book Center and YIVO. Esther sang in the Kultur Gezelshaft Chorus and supported cultural, women's, social service, pacifist and environmental organizations.
