He is survived by his dear wife Yolanda, his children John, Carter, Jill, and Amy, and five grandchildren. Born in Chicago in 1932, John graduated from Yale University and received his law degree from the University of Michigan. A partner at Dykema Gossett in Detroit, he practiced corporate law for 37 years. His significant leadership positions included the presidencies of the Mental Health Association In Michigan, Metropolitan Detroit YWCA, National Project Equality, and Project Equality of Michigan. A devoted Episcopalian, John contributed much time, talent and energy to church causes. In addition to his service to the Church Pension Fund, he chaired the CREDO Institute and the Board of the Episcopal Church Archives. He served as Parliamentarian of the Episcopal Church House of Deputies, Trustee and Chancellor of the Diocese of Michigan, and Senior Warden of Christ Church Cranbrook in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. John's passionate love of life embraced bird watching, wildlife photography, stamp collecting, model railroading, running, sailing, books, music, architecture and fine wine. A memorial service will be held on January 10, 2003 at 11 AM at Christ Church Cranbrook, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. In lieu of flowers, memorial gifts may be made to the Mental Health Association In Michigan, 15920 W. 12 Mile Road, Southfield, MI 48076, or to Clinic of Care and Rehabilitation of Wildlife, P.O.
