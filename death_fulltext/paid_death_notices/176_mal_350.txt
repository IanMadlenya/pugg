        FRIEDMAN-Andrew. Sadly lost in the WTC disaster. Andy, a dear, dear friend, has been taken from all of us much too soon. He was a large man in more than just physical size. The size of his heart was evident in the way that he cared for his family and for his friends. Nothing brought Andy more joy than his twin boys, and the affection that he showed them, with a hug or a kiss on the forehead, will remain with us always. To his beloved wife Lisa, sons Michael and Daniel, we share your loss and we will help to keep his memory alive. Love, Glenn & Anne Gold
