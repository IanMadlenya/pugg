        FISHER--Andrew M. We mourn the death of our bright, shining star who at 22 years of age, was tragically taken from us on Thursday November 27, 2003. Andrew was a budding artist who floated above this earth with his sunny disposition and happy view of life. He was the light of our lives. He leaves behind his mother Laura; his father Richard; his two brothers Hadley and Winston; and his sister Alexandra. Funeral services will be private.
        FISHER--Andrew M. A spiritual young man, blessed with beauty, inside and out. He was so kind and talented, and in my heart was much like another of my own children, though in fact he's my brother, Richard's son. My children, Eric and Madeline, are inconsolable, as are all of us in the Fisher family. We are all so close. We are shocked at losing such a vibrant boy just reaching the beginning of his adult years. Aunt Candia
