        ALLFREY-Vincent G. The Rockefeller University community mourns with deep sadness the loss of our distinguished colleague and beloved friend, Vincent G. Allfrey. Professor Allfrey, a valued member of the Rockefeller University research community for more than 60 years, was a pioneer in the study of post-synthetic modification of histones and other chromosomal proteins. He will long be remembered for his contributions to the scientific understanding of the role of chromosomal proteins in the organization of DNA and in the regulation of gene activity in higher organisms, as well as for his deep commitment and skill as a teacher. Dr. Allfrey will be profoundly missed. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his family. Thomas P. Sakmar, Acting President Richard B. Fisher, Chairman, Board of Trustees David Rockefeller, Honorary Chairman and Life Trustee, Board of Trustees
