He is survived by his wife of 58 years, Florence, his daughter Elizabeth, his son Daniel, and his four grandchildren. Dr. Dexter received his degree from CCNY and his doctorate from NYU. A scientist by instinct and a chemist by profession, he worked for Squibb Pharmaceutical for several years before starting a thirty-year career at Ciba-Geigy. His contributions to the scientific community were numerous and varied. His pharmaceutcial research included work in the synthesis of anti-malarial drugs, bronchodialators, anticoagulants, and penicillin. The area in which he gained the most recognition both in the US, and internationally was in the development of compounds that help preserve plastics against degradation. Dr. Dexter was the inventor on more than 140 US patents and 500 international patents. In 1984, he was honored as ''Inventor of the Year'' by the New York Patent Trademark office, which recognized him for a lifetime of creative contributions to science. In 1996, as a tribute to his incredible ingenuity, intellect, and productivity, Ciba named their new state-of-the-art research facility in Tarrytown, which houses some 160 scientists, the ''Martin Dexter Laboratory.'' A private family service will take place in Briarcliff.
