        ENGEN-Donald D. The Directors of the Association for Rescue at Sea, Inc. express great sorrow at the untimely death of Vice Admiral Donald D. Engen, USN (Ret), a member of the Board and former president of the Association. Under his leadership AFRAS acquired two lifeboats for Britain's Royal National Lifeboat Institution. The boats, he named ''American Ambassador'' and ''Spirit of America,'' continue to put to sea with their volunteer crews to save the lives of those in peril on the treacherous waters around the U.K. With Vice Admiral Thomas R. Sargent, USCG (Ret), he also established an award to recognize a U.S. Coast Guardperson's extraordinary bravery during a sea rescue. The award is presented annually in the U.S. House of Representatives. Don will be deeply missed by all, especially his friends in the sea services. Our heartfelt condolences to Mary, daughter Candace Ellis and sons Travis, Charles and Christopher. Admiral James S. Gracey, USCG (Ret), Chairman Vice Admiral John G. Finneran, USN (Ret), Vice Chairman David D. Chomeau, President
