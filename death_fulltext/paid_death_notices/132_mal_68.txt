        ENGLER-James J., of Manhattan, died December 20, 1997 at age 81. Born in Dubuque, Iowa, he was a violinist and vocalist with big bands in the 1930's, a film and stage actor in the '40s and '50s, appearing in both the stage and screen versions of ''Winged Victory,'' and later was a successful cosmetics company executive. He is survived by his wife, Lynne C. Engler, and his daughter, Carla L. Engler, both of Manhattan, two brothers, Donald, of Fort Pierce, FL, and Irvin, of Dubuque, and a grandson, James Wylie Deitch. He is still so loved, and will be missed incredibly by us all.
