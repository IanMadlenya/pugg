        TARAIL-Mark, D.S.W. The Department of Psychiatry of Maimonides Medical Center and the Maimonides Community Mental Health Center mourn the passing of one of its founders, Mark Tarail. Mark was a truly charismatic leader and teacher. He was a courageous champion of the disenfranchised. As Professor in the Graduate School of Social Work at NYU, he transmitted his vision of a world in which health care would be available to all regardless of race, creed, or ability to pay. He is remembered with pride & affection by countless mental health professionals who studied and worked with him. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Helen, brother Theodore, children, Judith and Michael, and to his seven grandchildren and five great grandchildren. Marvin H. Lipkowitz, M.D., Chairman Marcel Biberfeld, D.S.W., Vice President Department of Psychiatry Maimonides Medical Center
