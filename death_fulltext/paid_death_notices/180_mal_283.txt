        O'DONNELL-John B. The staff of The John O'Donnell Company mourns the death of John B. O'Donnell, our President, colleague, and friend. A pioneer in the field of fund raising, John worked to strengthen non-profit organizations of many different kinds for nearly 40 years. His creativity, courage, energy, and his sense of caring and fair play were extraordinary. John was a prince, and we will miss him always.
