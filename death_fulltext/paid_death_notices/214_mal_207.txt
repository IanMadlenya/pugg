        EIDELSON--Joseph. The entire family of the East Midwood Jewish Center mourns the passing of its beloved Cantor Emeritus who for over four decades chanted the liturgy with unique dignity, spirituality, fervor and grace. His musical talents were exceeded only by his kindness and compassion as a human being. He will endure forever as an indispensable leader in the annals of our synagogue. We offer our heartfelt condolences to Carol and Joel and all the members of their family. Zevie B. Schizer, President Dr. Alvin Kass, Rabbi
