        MORISHIMA-Akira, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Pediatrics. The Department of Pediatrics of the College of Physicians & Surgeons at Columbia University and the Pediatric Service and Alumni Association of Babies & Children's Hospital of New York, ColumbiaPresbyterian Medical Center, mourn the loss of their esteemed friend and colleague. A former Director of the Division of Pediatric Endocrinology (1968-1995), Dr. Morishima was an early leader in the field of genetics and did innovative work with his mentor, Melvin Grumbach, MD, in describing normal characteristics as well as disorders of the X chromosome. He also was involved in collaborative studies on the mutagenic properties of marijuana and other recreational drugs. Most recently, and most importantly, Dr. Morishima, through his insights from work with patients, elucidated in a very exciting way the role estrogen plays in bone growth and bone calcification and in normal pituitary-gonadal interactions in both sexes. Dr. Morishima maintained professional ties with Japan as a visiting professor and keynote speaker at professional meetings and was active in the Japanese-American communities in New York and New Jersey. In recognition of these activities, in 1975 he received the prestigious ''Presentation of a Favour'' from the Emperor and Empress of Japan. Dr. Morishima was an enthusiastic teacher and generous colleague. We are grateful for the guidance and insights he gave us during his long years of leadership in the Department and in the field of pediatric endocrinology. John M. Driscoll, Jr., MD Reibem S. Carpentier Professor Director, Pediatric Service Chairman, Dept of Pediatrics
