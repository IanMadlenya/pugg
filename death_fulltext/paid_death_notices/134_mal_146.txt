        HECHT-George. The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art mourns the death of George Hecht, inventor, manufacturing executive and philanthropist. A 1930 electrical engineering graduate, Mr. Hecht was a lifelong friend of the college and one of its most generous benefactors. As an engineer at Bell Labs during W.W. II, he invented components of the Navy's first radar system and held sixteen patents on electronic switching systems. A public-spirited citizen, Mr. Hecht was a patron of a number of city organizations, including the New York Zoological Society, Central Park Conservancy, the Horticultural Society of NY, and WNET/ Channel 13. A major gift from Mr. Hecht made it possible for Cooper Union and various city agencies to collaborate on the creation of a public viewing garden in the East Village to be completed this summer. Mr. Hecht loved the city, its parks and gardens, and his alma mater. A memorial service-to celebrate Mr. Hecht's life and his contributions to humankind-will be held at the Cooper Union at a date to be announced. We shall miss his friendship, generosity and spirit.

        HECHT-George. The Horticultural Society of New York has lost one of its most graceful, gracious and generous supporters and benefactors. His gifts in 1997 made it possible for HSNY to prepare inmates in HSNY's GreenHouse Program at Rikers Island for their return to society, job ready and job eager. His presence at virtually every HSNY event ensured success because he brought passion, intelligence, curiosity and civility with him into every room his presence graced. We shall miss him profoundly.
