As a well-known and respected Interior Designer he had the advantage of not only living in surroundings of unusual beauty but also helping to create them.

He continued his studies at Oxford University before returning to New York to begin his career at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and then the Frick Gallery. He then worked as an assistant to Rose Cumming where he learned the commercial aspects of dealing in fine antique furniture, accessories and Interior Design. He opened his own antiques and decorating business in 1949. He had antique showrooms in Manhattan and East Hampton, New York, and was commissioned to decorate notable residences throughout Europe and North America. During his life he was proud to have had the privilege of forging lasting and close friendships with many of his clients. He is survived by his son, Nicholas S. Hare of Darien; daughter-in-law, Christina K. Hare, and two grandchildren, Alexander and Michelle.
