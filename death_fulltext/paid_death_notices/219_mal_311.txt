        WHITE--John F. The Cooper Union Alumni Association mourns the death of John F. White, former President of The Cooper Union. Presiding over the college through challenging and turbulent times, he earned the respect, admiration and love of students, faculty, trustees and alumni alike for his progressive and principled ideals and his enlightened and courageous leadership. In this, he steadfastly upheld and promoted the essential mission of the institution and its beloved founder, Peter Cooper. He was a longstanding friend of the CUAA and will be dearly missed by the Cooper Union alumni family.
