        ROSENFELD--Barbara. Of Red Bank, NJ, on September 26, 2003, after a long and courageous battle against cancer. Beloved wife of Jerry, her husband, best friend and soul mate of 43 years. Loving and devoted mother of Jennifer Pileggi and Robin Davis, adoring and doting grandmother of P.J. Davis. Also survived by sons-in-law Brad Pileggi and Dave Davis. A devotee of The New York Times crossword puzzle and Op Ed page, especially Maureen Dowd, Nicholas Kristof and Bill Keller.
