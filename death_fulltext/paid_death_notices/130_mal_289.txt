        HATHAWAY-Clemens F. Former Vice President at J. Walter Thompson died Nov. 13, 1997 at his home in Totowa, New Jersey. The cause of death was complications following a series of strokes. He was 83 years old. Mr. Hathaway began his long career in advertising at J. Walter Thompson in 1935 where he quickly made a mark as an innovative account manager. His work there was punctuated by some intermissions including stints at two other agencies and World War II service as a Navy Lieutenant JG in the Pacific Theater. He spent the years from 1947 to 1961 at Control-O-Gram in Illinois. On his return to New York, he rejoined Thompson as a vice president. There he stayed until 1966 when BBDO hired him to manage their Burger King business. When Thompson won the large national account in 1976, Clem was quickly lured back. A creative account manager, he spearheaded the memorable Burger King work of that period. He retired in 1981 and is still remembered with affection by those who had the pleasure of working with him. His wife of 27 years, Mildred, his sons from a previous marriage, John of Darien, CT., and David of Millbrook, NY, four grandsons and one granddaughter survive Mr. Hathaway. A memorial service will be held Sunday, December 14 at 3PM in the Noroton, CT. Presbyterian Church. Memorial contributions may be sent to Mr. Hathaway's alma mater, Union College, C/O Annual Fund Office, Schenectady, New York 12308.
