        GREGORY-Anne Elizabeth. 65, of Manhattan and Southampton, died February 24 after a long battle with lung cancer. She had a distinguished career as a financial editor and investment manager in New York and was one of the first women to rise to vice president at Merrill Lynch. Born in Leamington, Ontario, on November 2, 1936, she was educated at St. Mary's School in Raleigh, NC, and Hollins University in Roanoke, VA, where she graduated in 1958. After joining Merrill Lynch that fall, she became a writer for its bi-weekly publication, Investor's Reader, and was named its executive editor in 1972. She went on to become the founding editor of The Merrill Lynch Market Letter, the firm's first subscriber-driven investment advisory service. She was named a vice president in 1974. After retiring in 1987, she opened her own money-management firm, Gregory Capital Management, which she ran until she became ill in the summer of 2000. An avid golfer, she was a member of Shinnecock Hills Golf Club and Yeamans Hall in Charleston, SC. She was also a member of The Meadow Club of Southampton and the Cosmopolitan Club in New York. The daughter of Herbert T. Gregory and the late Helen Elizabeth Gregory, she is survived by her father and his wife, Marion, of Leamington and by her brother, Herbert Jr. and his wife, Patti, of Oxford NC. An older brother, Francis, predeceased her. Funeral services will be on Wednesday, February 27, at 1 o'clock at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church in Oxford, with interment to follow at the family cemetery in nearby Stovall, where the Gregory family has engaged in farming since the early 19th Century. A memorial service will be held in Southampton this spring. The family requests that memorials be sent to a charity of one's choice.
