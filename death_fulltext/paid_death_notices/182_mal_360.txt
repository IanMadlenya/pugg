        ROBSON-John Edwin. The Board of Trustees and professional staff of the American Folk Art Museum record with sorrow the death of their friend, John Robson, the husband of Margaret Robson, a devoted member of the Museum's Board. Possessed of a winning personality, keen intellect and a true commitment to public service, John will be remembered by us with affection and respect for his lively, generous spirit and unfailing kindness, and for his many contributions to American life. To Margaret and Doug, their son, go our deepest and most heartfelt condolences. Ralph Esmerian, Chairman L. John Wilkerson, President Board of Trustees Gerard C. Wertkin, Director
