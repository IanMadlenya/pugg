        BERNSTEIN--Arnold J. The entire Board of Trustees and the Blythedale Children's Hospital community mourn the loss of our dear friend and long-standing Board Member, Arnold J. Bernstein. Arnold was a devoted supporter of the work of the Hospital since 1953 when he became a member of the Board. In 1964, he became Vice President, a position he held until 1972 when he was elected to a five-year term as President of the Board. In 1990, Arnold stepped down as a member of our ''active'' Board and became an Honorary Trustee. He cared deeply about our children and their care. We send deep and sincere condolences to his wife Jeanne, his daughters Linda Miller, Carol Clark and Janael McQueen, as well as the entire Bernstein family. Laurence W. Cohen, Chair of the Board of Trustees Larry Levine, President and CEO Joelle Mast, PhD, M.D., VP and Chief Medical Officer
