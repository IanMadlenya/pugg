        SINGER--Nell. The Rockefeller University community deeply mourns the loss of our cherished friend, Nell Singer, an esteemed member of The Rockefeller University Council. With her beloved husband, the late Herbert Singer, Mrs. Singer was a longtime and steadfast supporter of the University and its Hospital. The Herbert and Nell Singer Fellowship, which she established as a tribute to Herb, is today a fitting legacy of their shared passion for scientific investigation and their belief in the importance of basic research in providing answers to the many health problems that confront humanity. Mrs. Singer will be remembered by all for her kind, sweet, and generous nature. We are grateful for having had the privilege of her friendship for more than 30 years. We extend our deepest condolences to her beloved family. David Rockefeller, Honorary Chairman and Life Trustee, Board of Trustees Richard M. Furlaud, Chairman, RU Council Paul Nurse, President Joshua Lederberg, President Emeritus Torsten Wiesel, President Emeritus Fernando Nottebohm, Dorothea L. Leonhardt Professor
