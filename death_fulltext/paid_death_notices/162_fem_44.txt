        MARTIN-Dr. Josephine D. Died July 6, 2000, after a long courageous battle, stoic and still giving in her loving way. Her husband Robert Schwartz is deeply grieved and her loss is felt by her nephews Michael and Charles Diaz, and their children, Robert's daughterin-law Dr. Gail Ross, and his grandchildren. Jo, a dedicated doctor, gave deeply of herself, often without remuneration, a prominent civil rights activist, including participation in the Mississippi Summer, the unofficial doctor to SNCC. She practiced in NYC and in the British Health System in London. At Bellevue, she established programs for children and healthcare programs at welfare hotels. Her dedication in the perpetual struggle for healthcare, human rights and opposition to tyranny is an inspiration. There will be a commemoration shortly after Labor Day. Contributions can be made to the Josephine D. Martin Medical and Human Rights Committee, c/o ECAAR, 211 East 43 St, New York, NY 10017.
