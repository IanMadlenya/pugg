        BERNTSEN-Carl A., Jr., M.D. The Board of Trustees, Medical Staff and Administration of the Hospital for Special Surgery mourn with profound sorrow the death of Physician Emeritus Carl A. Berntsen, Jr., M.D. who was on the staff of the hospital for over 40 years. Dr. Berntsen's work in rheumatology contributed greatly to the progress made in that field. He was a compassionate, caring physician deeply devoted to the well being of the many hundreds of patients for whom he cared during his long and illustrious career. He will be greatly missed. We extend our deepest sympathies to the Berntsen family. Richard L. Menschel Winfield P. Jones Co-Chairmen of the Board of Trustees John R. Ahearn John R.
