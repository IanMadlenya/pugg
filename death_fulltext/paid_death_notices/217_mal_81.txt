        LEMANSKY--Julius. 94, of Deerfield Beach, FL. Formerly of Brooklyn, NY. Died peacefully following a brief illness on February 5. He was preceded in death by his beloved wife Hannah. He is survived by daughter Susan (Joel) Agee; son Edward (Ruth) and granddaughters Gina Agee and Wendy Lemansky. He was a graduate of Boys High School (1927), CCNY (1931) and Columbia University (1933). He taught History and English at Boys High from 1937 to 1951, until he was fired for refusing to cooperate with the inquisition that came to be known as McCarthyism. Many years later, following a lengthy court battle, he was reinstated and worked as a librarian at Lincoln High School until his retirement in 1974. He will be sorely missed by his family and his many friends.
