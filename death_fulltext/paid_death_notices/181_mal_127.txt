        ROSEN-Richard. On February 8, 2002, Richard Rosen passed away in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, after a brief, but hard-fought battle with congestive heart failure. Dick was a self-made man. Born in 1930 and raised in Brooklyn, Dick earned himself a place at Brooklyn Technical High School and graduated from Cornell University in 1953 with a degree in civil engineering. After a two-year tour as an Army engineer, Dick worked as a civil engineer. Finding engineering insufficiently challenging, Dick put himself through NYU's business school at night. Dick went on to become a management consultant and a partner in the New York accounting firm of Anchin, Block & Anchin. Dick married Goldy Meresman in 1956, and they moved to Garden City, New York, in 1957, where they raised three children, Robert, Susan, and Stephen. After Dick's retirement to Hilton Head Island in 1996, he became an avid, but not always successful golfer. After Goldy's death, Dick and Maxine Uttal fell in love and spent a happy year together. Most of all, Dick will be remembered as a man who loved his many old friends, a gentle giant, a towering intellect, a man who did not suffer fools gladly, and a great provider by Maxine, his three children, and his six grandchildren. Memorial services will be held on Tuesday, February 12 at 3 PM, at Temple Beth Yam, Hilton Head Island.
