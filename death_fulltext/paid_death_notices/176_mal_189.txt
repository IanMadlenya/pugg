        RAGAZZONI - Gian Domenico. The Attending and Professional Staffs of the Department of Medical Physics of the Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center mark with deep sorrow the passing of our colleague and friend, Gian Domenico Ragazzoni, M.S., D.A.B.R. Mr Ragazzoni came to the United States after World War II from Italy and always retained his love of his native Bologna. He received his M.S. from the Medical Physics program at Columbia University. Mr. Ragazzoni was certified in Radiological Physics by the American Board of Radiology in 1965. He was appointed to the Medical Staff of the Memorial Hospital where he achieved the rank of Associate Attending Physicist. A gifted teacher, he was responsible for the teaching programs in physics for residents in diagnostic and therapeutic radiology for over twenty years. He educated hundreds of radiologists, radiation oncologists and medical physicists, many of whom became leaders in their professions. He also fostered the careers of many graduate fellows in medical physics by his personal involvement in their education and in their professional development. Some of these fellows have stayed in the metropolitan area as leaders of their respective groups while others have assumed positions of leadership across the United States and abroad. We will miss his unfailing good humor, his love of teaching and the many gifts that he shared so freely with all who encountered him. We celebrate his life and extend our deepest sympathies to his grieving family.
