        ASHLEY-Ted. The Board and Staff of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts mourn the passing of Ted Ashley. A dear friend and thoughtful leader, Mr. Ashley served us as an esteemed member of the Board of Directors from 1981-1995, and as Director Emeritus since 1995. A true friend of the performing Arts, Mr. Ashley was a kind, warm, and hard working gentleman who generously gave of himself through his service to Lincoln Center. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife Page, his four daughters, his two grandchildren, his brother Alfred Ashley and family. He will be deeply missed by all who knew him. Bruce Crawford, Chairman Reynold Levy, President Martin E. Segal and June Noble Larkin, Co-Chairs, Directors Emeriti Council Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts
