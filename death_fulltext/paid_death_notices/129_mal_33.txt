        LICHTENSTEIN-Roy. The staff and trustees of the Whitney Museum of American Art are deeply saddened by the loss of Roy Lichtenstein, truly an American innovator. His brilliance as an artist and commentator captured the essence of American culture during some of its most complex times. We are proud to have supported him as an artist and to have counted him as a friend of the museum. Flora M. Biddle, Hon. Chairman Leonard A. Lauder, Chairman Gilbert C. Maurer, President David A. Ross, Director
