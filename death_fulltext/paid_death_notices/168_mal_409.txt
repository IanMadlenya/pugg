        MALTONI-Cesare. The Executive and Fellows of the Collegium Ramazzini mark with great sadness the passing of the General Secretary of our organization, Professor Cesare Maltoni age 70, at his home in Bologna, Italy on January 21, 2001. Professor Maltoni was a distinguished pathologist and oncologist who made fundamental contributions to the literature of carcinogenesis. His passionate dedication to the health and safety of workers around the world led him to translate these laboratory findings into practical steps for worker protection against carcinogen exposure and cancer. Vigorous and outspoken, Professor Maltoni's discoveries on the cancer causing properties of benzene and vinyl chloride and many other industrial substances, have made the workplace safer for millions of workers around the world. With the late Professor Irving Selikoff, Professor Maltoni founded the Collegium Ramazzini, an organization based in the City of Carpi, Italy, the birthplace of Bernardino Ramazzini, the father of occupational medicine, which is dedicated to the scientific bases of occupational medicine and its social consequences. Professor Maltoni's work will be continued by the Fellows of the Collegium.
