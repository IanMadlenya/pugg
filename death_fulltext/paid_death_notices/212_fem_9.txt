        KATZMAN--Selma. Died August 31. Two and a half weeks shy of her 80th birthday. Loving wife to Bernard Katzman, devoted mother to Karen and Melanie Katzman, playful mother-in-law to Russell Makowsky and wildly proud grandmother to Wyndam and Harper Makowsky. Beloved sister to Lillian Schwartz, Leon and Frank Slavin, and spirited sister-inlaw to Roslyn and Harry Katzman, Joan and Jack Katzman and Jean and Julie Slavin. A vibrant presence with time and respect for everyone; the hole she leaves behind is deep but every life she touched she made fuller. Funeral services will be held today at ''Plaza Jewish Community Chapel'', 630 Amsterdam Ave., at 91st St. at 12:30PM. Donations may be made to Congretation BnaiJeshurun, 2109 Broadway, #
