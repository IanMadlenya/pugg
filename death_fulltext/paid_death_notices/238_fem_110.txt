        KREITMAN--Roslyn, born in NYC, April 19, 1913 passed away in Miami on November 16, 2006. Roslyn graduated from James Madison High School in Brooklyn and from Parsons School of Design, NYC. She was a teacher, artist, mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, aunt and friend. She lived a long, beautiful, full and purposeful life. A talented singer and pianist, she and her beloved sister, the late Edith Land (Jack) had a radio program (The Miller Sisters) and put on shows for the USO during WWII and other community events. She relinquished a professional career in the world of show business, in order to work side by side, with her husband Dr. Julius Kreitman, (deceased) in Brooklyn, become ''Mrs. Doctor'', and to nurture her family and create a life full of love and laughter, infusing the lives of her family, friends and community with joy, music and the arts. This has become her treasured legacy. Active in her community, she was a founding member of the Young Married Group of Union Temple in Brooklyn and was president of the Rose Servich Relief Society. After moving to Miami Beach in 1972, she became a tough community watchdog, employing her warrior Aries nature, courageously lobbying to maintain and improve the area's quality of life, while bringing drama and humor to the city commission meetings. She was instrumental in the creation of the park, on Purdy Ave, and the Venetian Causeway, Miami Beach. Roslyn is survived by her son Dr. Gary Kreitman (Madeleine), daughter Marcia Kreitman (John Hawver), granddaughters Heather McCabe (Terry) and Susanne Taylor (Stephen), great-grandchildren Jaedon Taylor, and Ella and Cole McCabe and soon to be, Mason Taylor, nephew Dr. Allan Land (Vicki) and grandniece Jacqueline. In her last years Rosylyn was lovingly cared for by Marie Claud-Louis and Carline Augustine-Stroud, who have become her family. Grave side services for family will be held Sunday November, 19, 2:00pm at Mt Nebo Cemetery N.W, 3rd St. Miami.
