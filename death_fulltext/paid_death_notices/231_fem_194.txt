        JACOBS--Jane. The Board of Directors of the Center for the Living City at Purchase College mourns the loss of a dear friend, mentor and inspiration for the formation of the Center. With humility and common sense, she taught the world how to understand and value cities and their economies through direct observation, persistent questioning and discovery. Her faith in the wisdom of local citizens lives on in the civic battles in which she participated and her influence lives on in the writing of her nine books. The Center will sponsor a celebration of her life and work later in the summer. Roberta Brandes Gratz, Ron Shiffman, Mary Rowe, Stephen Goldsmith, Richard Rabinowitz, Samina Queraeshi
