        GROSS-Irwin. Suddenly on April 30, 1997. Beloved husband of Lynn, cherished father of Robin and Richard, loving grandfather of Max and Wyatt, loving brother of Tena Rubin. Dr. Irwin Gross was a giant in the fields of creative art and art education. He was principal of the High School of Art and Design, recognized as one of the outstanding art high schools in the United States. Prior to that he had been selected as the New York City Board of Education's Director of Art. This followed a three year period during which he served as the Director of the federally funded Project Outreach headquartered at the Detroit Institute of Arts. Among his many contributions to art education were numerous writings of curriculums, keynote addresses to numerous art education associations and the presidency of the Queensboro Association for the Visual Arts. Dr. Gross' paintings are displayed in assorted corporate and private collections in the United States and Canada, including the Riverside Museum in New York City and the Detroit Institute of Arts. He is listed in Who's Who in American Art and was a Fellow of the National Endowment for Humanities. Dr. Gross had a zest for living. His constant curiosity and insatiable thirst for new projects made life a series of great adventures for him. One could not escape the magnetism of his personality and his enthusiasm for what he was doing was contagious. Since he enjoyed sharing his joys and interests with us, our lives were immeasurably enriched. The feelings of great loss by family, friends, & colleagues are beyond measure. His passing signals the end of an era. He was truly loved and will be dearly missed.
