        HORMAN-Joseph J. Of Kingwood, TX, formerly of New York, on November 12. Born in East New York, Brooklyn, Mr. Horman chose to leave the relative security of the family business to serve as a member of New York's Finest, the NYPD. His meteoric rise from rookie cop at Manhattan's 14th Precinct during the '60s to Lieutenant Detective in the early '70s, during which he led a massive crackdown upon organized crime involved in pornography, resulted in the William Sherman book entitled Times Square, which chronicled the harsh realities behind the lights and glitter of Broadway during the Koch administration. He is survived by his mother Winifred Jackman Horman of Glen Head, NY, wife Arlene, daughter Katherine and son Joseph Jr. He is also survived by his brothers Nicholas Horman of Oyster Bay, NY, Ronald Horman of Locust Valley, NY, and Douglas Horman of Deerfield Beach, FL.
