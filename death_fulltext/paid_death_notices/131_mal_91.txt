        FAISON-John W. (Jack). The Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service mourns the passing of long-time Board member and close friend Jack Faison. A Director of our organization for 45 years, he was deeply committed to our work with vulnerable children and the disabled. He contributed to the organization as fundraiser, advocate and volunteer. We will miss Jack terribly and fondly remember him as the best humored, kindest and most generous of gentlemen. We extend deepest sympathy to Jack's beloved family and many friends, in particular his wife Grace and his children Jeffrey and Sandy. Charles J. Hamm, Chairman Donna A. Santarsiero, Executive Director
