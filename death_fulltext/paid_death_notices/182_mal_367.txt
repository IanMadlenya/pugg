        GILCHRIST-David I. Of Southampton Village died of respiratory failure at Southampton Hospital on Wednesday evening March 20 at the age of 78. He was a lieutenant in the US Navy from 1943 to 1946 on a yard minesweeper. He attended Swarthmore College and Columbia University Law School where he earned his LLB. in 1950. He also held a Master's degree in International Law from New York University. In the 50's Dave spent a year as full-time lobbyist for the United World Federalists, an organization which believes in strengthening the United Nations for the support of world peace through world law. He returned to the law at Hill, Betts and Nash where he enjoyed a satisfying practice in the fields of maritime and international law for 31 years until his retirement in 1985. For five of those years he served as his firm's managing partner. Since his retirement Dave fulfilled his desire to be of public service to his community of Southampton. He served on many Town and Village committees, was tirelessly active in the Town Democratic Party and gave generously of his time and energy to social and environmental causes. Dave was a concerned and active citizen and a good man loved by many. He will be sorely missed by his community as well as his friends and family. He is survived by his wife Marilyn, his son Josh and his daughter Mary. There will be a memorial service at the Unitarian Universalist Church located in the Watermill Community Association on Montauk Highway in Watermill. The service will be held on Sunday, April 14 at 12:30 PM.
