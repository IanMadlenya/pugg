        GELFAND -- Judy. Beloved wife and life partner of Marshall, our Foundation Chairman, which, under his guiding spirit, was formed 50 years ago at Syracuse University. Judy passed away on July 13, affectionately surrounded by her entire family, and is now at peace, ending her many years of fighting Alzheimers disease. Her life was devoted to the welfare of her family, her husband's varied interests, and the many contributions she made to her community of Palm Springs, CA. Her loving relationship with Marshall evolved into one that nurtured an inner strength in family life and values, resulting in the warmth and love so necessary in maintaining a caring home. She lived to enjoy its beauty, and leaves a legacy that shines in reflection through her husband, her children and grandchildren. Our sympathies go out to them all.
