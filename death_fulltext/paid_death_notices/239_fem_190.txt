        SCIUTTO--Elizabeth Higgins, on December 28, in New York, survived and greatly missed by her husband, Ernest; her children, Mary, Nellie, Patsy and Jimmy; grandchildren, Austin, Henry, Nicky, Charles and Ella; and sisters, Margaret and Nell. Elizabeth was born in Louisville, KY, and while she remained a Kentuckian at heart, she was a true New Yorker. She was a lifelong, natural writer--both as a journalist, from her first job at WHAS-TV in Louisville to long service at McCall's, Family Circle and Newsweek, and as a poet, conveying emotion with insight and sincerity. A mother so unselfishly dedicated to her family, we her husband and children only hope to approach the standard she set for us. She was a wife who showed how rich a marriage can be. She treated her many close friends like family. She inspired us to stick to our beliefs, show compassion for others and work to change the world for the better. Visiting hours: Saturday, December 30, 2-5pm, Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home, 81st and Madison Ave. Funeral: Monday, January 1, 9:30am, St. Ignatius Loyola Church, 84th and Park Ave. In lieu of flowers, please make donations in her name to St. Ignatius Loyola Church, 980 Park Ave., New York, NY 10028.
