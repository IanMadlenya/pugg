        ROSENBLOOM--Esther. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society mourn the loss of Esther Rosenbloom of Baltimore. Mrs. Rosenbloom was a beloved friend and a Technion Guardian whose support through the Ben and Esther Rosenbloom Foundation was vital. Her son Howard Rosenbloom, an active member of the national and Baltimore boards of directors, continues her legacy of support. To Mr. Rosenbloom and his wife Dr. Michelle Gelkin, to Harriet Rosenbloom and to Mrs. Rosenbloom's grandchildren and great-grandchildren, we extend our deepest sympathy.
