        MOYER-Kerry. Age 41, of Manhattan. Beloved son of Grace Moyer of Reading, PA, and the late Leonard Lecce; brother of Lenora. Penn State and Parsons ('79). His talent for design -from a tycoon's Mexican Shangri-la to smart Park Avenue addresses and outlandish Pines parties -was matched by his capacity to love. He never met a room he couldn't make fabulous, if just by walking in.
