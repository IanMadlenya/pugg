        MILLSTEIN-Alan G. On Friday, January 23, 1998. Dear friend, former husband. A man of piercing intelligence, uncommon wit, unique perspective, with wide interests in art, theater, the cinema, and a love of New York City. I am eternally grateful to him for always making me laugh and for introducing me to a world of beauty and fashion and glamour, which changed my life only for the better. ''At the round earth's imagin'd corners, blow Your trumpets, Angells, and arise, arise from death ...and you whose eyes, Shall behold God, and never taste deaths woe.'' Anne Taylor Davis Millstein
