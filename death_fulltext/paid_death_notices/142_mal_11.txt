        NIKOV-Sgt. Alexei. Yeshivat Sha'alvim in Israel mourns Sgt. Asher Nikov, alumnus of the Lycee Sha'alvim in Kharkov, Ukraine, a joint project of Yeshivat Sha'alvim and the Orthodox Union. There, and at the Joseph K. Miller Torah Center in Kharkov, Asher developed his love for Torah heritage and Israel. His army jeep intercepted a Palestinian terrorist attack on a school bus with forty Israeli children. He made the supreme sacrifice. Our condolences to his parents. Yeshivat Sha'alvim
