        YUKER-Dr. Harold E. In sympathy: Hofstra University is profoundly saddened by the death of Dr. Harold E. Yuker, Distinguished Professor of Psychology, Director of the Center for the Study of Attitudes Towards Persons With Disabilities and former Hofstra Provost and Dean of Faculties. Dr. Yuker died on Monday, August 24, at age 73. For almost five decades, Dr. Yuker had been actively involved in the life of Hofstra University. In 1948 he began his professional career at Hofstra as a teacher in the Department of Psychology, and he became internationally recognized for his research dealing with attitudes toward disabled persons. He graduated cum laude with his DBA degree from the University of Newark, his M.A. degree in psychology from the New School for Social Research, and his Ph.D in social psychology from New York University. In grateful appreciation for his extraordinary service, dedication and generosity to Hofstra, the University named the Harold E. Yuker Reference Library in his honor in 1995. A funeral service will be held Thursday, August 28, 11 AM, at the Monroe Lecture Center at Hofstra University. A memorial service will be held on October 15 at the John Cranford Adams Playhouse. In recognition of Dr. Yuker's accomplishments, donations may be made to the Harold E. Yuker Distinguished Academic Scholarship Fund at Hofstra University. In tribute to the memory of Dr. Yuker, all Hofstra University flags have been lowered to half staff. James M. Shuart, President Helene Fortunoff, Chairperson, Board of Trustees Hofstra University
