        BEAME - Abraham D. The trustees, administration, and faculty of Yeshiva University mourn the recent passing of Mayor Abraham D. Beame, highly esteemed public servant, friend, and 1972 honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree recipient of our University. He dedicated his life to public service. His philanthropic, religious, and community activities and his custodianship of our city were characterized by judicious fairness and trustworthiness in both word and deed. We extend our deepest condolences to his son Bernard, and to his entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Robert M. Beren, Chairman, Board of Trustees Yeshiva University
