        TEBALDI--Renata. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of the beloved soprano Renata Tebaldi. She was among the greatest singers of the 20th century and the Met was fortunate to present her in 269 performances, more than any other opera house in the world. From the moment of her Met debut on January 31, 1955, she became a favorite of our audience and remained so well after she retired from singing. Mme. Tebaldi's opulent, powerful voice made her ideal for the core Italian repertory, and no one who heard her in the theater can forget the tremendous beauty and visceral impact of her interpretations. The epitome of the great Italian singing tradition, Tebaldi will remain a touchstone of that art for as long as people listen to opera. She considered the Met ''her'' opera house, and in many ways it was. The warmth she projected on stage added to the public's adoration, while her very real personal warmth and professionalism off stage made her a special favorite of those who worked behind the scenes on all levels of the staff and administration. We share in the sadness of her many friends and admirers and offer our sincere condolences to those closest to her. Joseph Volpe, General Mgr. James Levine, Music Dir.
