        DONOVAN--Frances M., 83, on December 13, 2004. Born and raised in Houlton, Maine, and a 1943 graduate of the University of Maine, she served with the American Red Cross in WWII, stationed in Kunming and Tientsin, China. After the war, she was assistant to Bill Cunningham, then one of the leading columnists and sportswriters at the Boston Herald. Later, she had a highly successful real estate career in Hudson, Ohio. She retired with her husband, Chris, to Seven Lakes, North Carolina in 1987, and following his death in 2002, moved to Greenwich, CT to be closer to her daughters and grandchildren. An avid sports fan her entire life, Fran was an accomplished golfer, with many club championships to her name. Hudson (Ohio) Country Club honored her in 1987 when it established the Donovan Cup, an annual women's match play tournament. She is survived by daughters Anne Donovan Bodnar and Jeanne Donovan Fisher, and their husbands, both of New York City; her granddaughters, Katharine Donovan Bodnar and Mary Anne Donovan Bodnar; her sister, Alice Ann Poeppelmeier, of Kennebunk, Maine; her brother Dr. James F. Donovan, also of Kennebunk; and her brother Dr. Thomas J. Donovan of Manchester CT. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made in Fran's memory to the Joseph A. and Mary A. Donovan Scholarship Fund, The University of Maine Foundation, Two Alumni Place, Orono, ME 04469. A celebration of Fran's life will be scheduled in early 2005.
