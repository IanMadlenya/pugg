        KELLY-Mary Lou. On October 26, 1999. In deep faith and enduring hope, cherished wife of James R., loving mother of James F., solicitous sister of Reverend James N. Loughran, S.J. and the late John F. Jr., precious daughter of the late John F. and Ethel Loughran. Typically, rather than the flowers that gave her such delight, Mary Lou requested that donations be sent to St. Peter's (Jersey City) or Mount St. Vincent's Colleges (Riverdale), where the spirits of Sts. Ignatius and Elizabeth Seton, which first formed and then sustained her, permeate the pursuit of truth. With the insight that loyal friendship brings, her colleagues at P.S. 105, where Mary taught for over thirty years, on the occasion of her necessary but too-early retirment wrote, Blessed they with peaceful spirits. Blessed they with gentle hearts. Visitation is on Wednesday and Thursday 2-5 PM and 7-9PM at McLaughlin & Son's Funeral Home Inc., 9620 3rd Ave., Brooklyn. Mass of Christian burial is Friday 9:30 A.M., Our Lady of Angel's Church, Bklyn. Interment Holy Cross Cemetery, Brooklyn.
