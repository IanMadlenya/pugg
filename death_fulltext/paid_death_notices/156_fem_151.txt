        LANE-Evelyn M. We are saddened upon the passing of our beloved ''Auntie'' Evelyn and extend condolences to our dear cousins, Ellen, Harry, Arielle and Dana Traub of Westport Ct.; and to Janice R. Lane of Boston Ma. A loving wife to her departed husband uncle ''Willie''; a devoted daughter to the late Esther (''Nanny'') and Joseph Rosenberg; and a loyal sister to Ethel Solomont Shulman and the late Sidney Ross-Auntie Evelyn was a beautiful woman whose family was her life and a photo her favorite keepsake. We shall miss her very much. Debra and Jay Solomont Jerusalem Israel
