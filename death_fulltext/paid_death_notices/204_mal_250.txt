        GROSSMARK -- Louis I., 1887-2004. Passed away January 2 after 106 years of a full and complete life. Emigrating from Eastern Europe to New York as a very young child, Louis put himself through school. After graduating from DeWitt Clinton High School, he received his B.A. from the City College of New York (CCNY), where he played Freshman Basketball on the Great CCNY Team of the era. Mr. Grossmark received his Master's from Columbia University and law degree from the Brooklyn Law School during the Great Depression. With no law opportunities at that time, he began teaching World and American history at Eastern District High School in Brooklyn, N.Y. During this stint of forty years, he was hailed as a brilliant, passionate teacher who affected the minds of thousands of students. Aside from teaching, Louis traveled by steamer to the far parts of the world in the 1920's and 1930's. He visited places that are still exotic by today's standards. After his retirement, he moved to Miami, Florida where he continued to touch the lives of all he came in contact with until his final days. Predeceased by his brother Harry Grossmark and sister Jean Hartstein, Louis is survived by his sister-inlaw Barbara Grossmark, his niece Linda (Sonny) Finkelstein, nephews Dr. Stephen (Lori) Grossmark, and Dr. Lawrence (Judy) Harte, nine great nephews and nieces and three great-great nephews. Donations in Mr. Grossmark's memory can be made to The Lighthouse for The Blind.
