        ALDRICH-Larry. The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art note with sorrow the death of Larry Aldrich. A benevolent early patron who believed passionately in supporting the art and artists of our time, Larry vastly enriched the Museum's collection by enabling the first acquisition of works by such artists as Brice Marden, Agnes Martin, Frank Stella, and Tom Wesselmann. Larry will forever be remembered for his foresight, generosity, and spirit. Ronald S. Lauder, Chairman Agnes Gund, President Glenn D. Lowry, Director The Museum of Modern Art, NY
