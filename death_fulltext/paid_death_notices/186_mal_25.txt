        CONSTANTINER-Dr. Jaime. The Board and staff of YIVO mourn the passing of Dr. Jaime Constantiner of Mexico City, a true friend to Yiddish and yidishkayt. His love for Jewish life, his East European ancestry and his commitment to preserve and teach the history and culture through programs at YIVO, are carried on by his son Arturo and his family. He was uniquely philanthropic and his generosity should be an example to us all. We extend our deepest sympathy to Arturo, his wife Caren, a member of YIVO's Leadership Forum, their children and other members of the Constantiner family. He will be sorely missed. Bruce Slovin, Chairman Dr. Carl J. Rheins, Executive Director Ella Levine, Director of Development
