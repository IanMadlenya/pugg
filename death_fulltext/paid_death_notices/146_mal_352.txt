        LEWIS-Sydney. Dear Frances, the death of Sydney caused me deep pain. In this difficult life I thought of him as a second father. I will always remember him as I do remember Cesare Cassina who was for me and for a long time more than a friend. Also as Venetian I would like to express here a Venetian's grief for the death of Sydney Lewis, its noble admirer. Gaetano Pesce
