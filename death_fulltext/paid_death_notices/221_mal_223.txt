Beloved son of Clayton and Cynthia Morgan, of Austin; adored brother of Lillian and Elliot Morgan. Some people wear their spirit on the outside. When you meet them your own light shines brighter. When they're gone, you still have the treasures they gave away every day. Andy gave us the extra light we need to face his sudden passing. Andy was an accomplished photographer, cook, athlete, artist and lover of literature. He graduated from Pacific Lutheran University with a degree in business administration and a minor in jazz studies. He was the manager at Blue Ribbon Bakery in New York at the time of his death, meeting with an accident as he cycled to work. He had traveled to most of the continental U.S., Europe, central Asia, Mexico and South America. Andy taught us all how important every day is. He recently wrote in a letter to his family, ''Remember, now is as good a time as ever because we are here on earth together. I know I'll look back on these days with weak legs and a bitter sweet gravity pulling towards my heart because this is all we have, and I have so much love for you. In addition to his immediate family, Andy is survived by many other relatives in Texas. His family thanks his co-workers and the owners of Blue Ribbon Bakery, Eric, Bruce and Michael, also Tom Lowry and Rodean Landeaux, Rex and Ginalola for their support and help. A remembrance will be held at Blue Ribbon Bakery at noon Wednesday.
