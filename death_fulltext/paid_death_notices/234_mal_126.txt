        TACKLER--Barry. He was loved, admired and respected by all who were lucky enough to know him. His strength belied his gentleness. For 60 years his smile dazzled me. There is no end to the seas he loved and no end to the wonderful times Paula, Barry and I shared. It all went too fast. Ri & The Compain Family
