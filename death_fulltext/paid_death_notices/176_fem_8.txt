Her enthusiasm for all that life has to offer was contagious to all who knew her. Born and raised in New York she thoroughly enjoyed contributing to every facet of life. After graduating from Barnard College her sense of commitment led her to serve with the Red Cross in India and China at the end of WWII undertaking assignments in Calcutta, Peking and Shanghai. Upon her return to New York she began her involvement with Irvington House, now the Irvington Institute for Immunological Research. She served on the Board of Directors for many years and has remained a Director Emeratti. She was instrumental in the development of the very successful Thrift Shop and in initiating the first Art and Antiques Benefit Auction at Sotheby's, for which she served as Chairman for many years. She was also active in a number of other charitable organizations including South Hampton Hospital for which she hosted several benefits at her home in Quogue, as recently as last year. She was always known for her gracious entertaining. Above all she will be remembered for her optimistic outlook on life, selflessness and ready smile.
