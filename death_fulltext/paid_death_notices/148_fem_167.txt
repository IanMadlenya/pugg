        MONTGELAS-Barbara. The volunteers and staff of Guiding Eyes for the Blind mourn the passing of our dear friend and longtime supporter, Barbara Montgelas. Through her outstanding generosity, the lives of many blind and visually impaired individuals have been, and continue to be, forever enriched. We, and the blind community she touched, will miss her.
