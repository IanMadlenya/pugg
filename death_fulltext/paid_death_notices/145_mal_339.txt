M.A. in Classical Studies from the University of Pennsylvania. Refused induction during the Vietnam War, and his case, with others, led to the widening of the definition of conscientious objection under the first Amendment to include more of those who refused to kill, but were not members of a traditional peace church. Taught adults to read as his alternative service in Philadelphia. Assisted several hobby clubs using his computing skills to further their goals. Dedicated reader of The New York Times. Held the Constitution with its promise of choice and privacy in high esteem. Known for his persistent attention to detail, kind and gentle manner, thorough concentration on the person or subject at hand, and a constant insistence on seeing the job through until it was done right, no matter the time or effort it took. He will be deeply and dearly missed by his wife, his family, and his many great friends.
