        GOODYEAR--John ''Jack,'' Jr., July 6, 2005, in Cherry Valley, New York. To everything he did, Jack brought a sharp eye and an even sharper wit, intelligent and wide-ranging curiosity, a gift for writing born of the pleasure he took in sharing his passions with others, the ability to take things in stride, a buoyant and infectious enthusiasm, an unquenchable sense of humor, engaging charm and a flair that was unmistakably his. These qualities never deserted him, even in his last illness, and accounted for his unusually wide and diverse circle of close friends. He had seven godchildren. He is survived by a large family, including his wife, the former Jane McGovern; two brothers, Dick and Sam Goodyear; and a cousin, Bradley Goodyear Smith.
