        MISROCK-S. Leslie. The partners and staff of the Pennie & Edmonds law firm record with great sorrow the death on August 7 of their most senior member following a long illness. This did not deter him from a distinguished career, a life of full activity and innumerable acts of generosity, humanity and enouragement toward his partners, colleagues, associates and friends. He will be missed, but his legacy and example are an enduring inspiration. The Partners of Pennie & Edmonds
        MISROCK-S. Leslie. Our condolences to Barbara, Kathy, Vicki, Adam, and Benjamin. Your husband, father, grandfather was a supreme gift to humanity. Love, Dr. & Mrs. Edward Socolow
