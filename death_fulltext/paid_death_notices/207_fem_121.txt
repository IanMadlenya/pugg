        BERMAN--Dr. Muriel Mallin. Hadassah WZOA mourns the loss of our dear colleague, member of the National Board and former President of the Eastern Pennsylvania Region. She recognized the need for educated professional nurses in Israel, was a generous supporter of nursing exchange and scholarship programs, underwrote the Muriel and Phillip Berman Nurses Residence at Hadassah Ein Kerem and was the driving force in establishing the Dr. Muriel M. Berman Masters of Clinical Nursing Program. Optometrist, businesswoman, human rights activist, lecturer, educator, television producer and moderator. High spirited and passionate patron of the arts who, with her late husband Phillip, donated major works of art in Israel and loaned hundreds of paintings from their personal collection to museums around the world. We extend our heartfelt condolences to the family. June Walker, Nat'l Pres.
