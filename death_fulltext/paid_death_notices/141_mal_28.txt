        RUBY-Arthur, M.D. We mourn the loss of Dr. Arthur Ruby, a most illustrous member of the Alumni of NYU School of Medicine. Dr. Ruby was the ultimate physician pediatrician who for many years served his patients and their families with utmost professionalism and compassion. He was loved, highly admired and respected by all he served and all who knew him. He was President of the Class of 1942 and led the Class for almost 60 years with extreme loyalty, dedication and devotion. He was proud of the Alumni of our school and we were always proud of him. The Alumni have lost their standard bearer. Our unique role model is gone. We express our deepest sympathy to Eleanor, his most devoted partner and spouse, and to his sons, Drs. Eric and Kenneth Ruby, and to his entire family. Saul J. Farber, M.D., MACP The Frederick H. King Professor and Chairman, Department of Medicine NYU School of Medicine and Director, Medical Services Bellevue and Tisch Hospitals
