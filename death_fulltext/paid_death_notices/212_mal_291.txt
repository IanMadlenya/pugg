        HARRIS--Irving B. A courageous champion of young children and families, an articulate and uncompromising social critic, a compassionate pragmatist. His convictions inspired the work of four generations of practitioners and researchers in the field of child development and early care and education. He made of his life a quest to repair the world. In his passionate desire to see, to integrate, to serve, and to heal, he embodied the highest role of humanity. He was our founder, our friend, our mentor, and our benefactor. His lively intelligence and keen insights will be missed, but his voice will never fall silent and his spark will illuminate for generations to come. Our deepest sympathy to his loving wife and strongest ally, Joan, and to his children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren, of whom he was so proud. Samuel J. Meisels, Ed.D., President, and the entire Board of Trustees, faculty, staff and student body of Erikson Institute, a graduate school in child development, Irving B. Harris, Founder
