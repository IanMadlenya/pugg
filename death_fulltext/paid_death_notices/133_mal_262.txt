        GROSSMAN-Rabbi Herman. We note with sadness the passing of our beloved colleague who served pulpits in Pennsylvania and New York before embarking on a 20 year career as a VA chaplain. After his retirement, he made aliyah to Israel with his family. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Roz and to his children and to all who were touched through his rabbinate. Rabbi David L. Lieber, President Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Exec. VP The Rabbinical Assembly
