        GRUNES-Ruth. The New York Freudian Society deeply grieves the death of our dear colleague, Dr. Ruth Grunes. She will be missed personally and professionally by the members of our Society, where her important contributions touched many aspects of our lives and functioning. She was Vice President of our Executive Board, Director of our Training Institute, and in her last position, Chairperson of our Ethics Committee. No one could have given more than she, and we are thankful that she gave so generously and so wisely. We will honor her memory. Harriet I. Basseches, Ph.D., Pres. New York Freudian Society
