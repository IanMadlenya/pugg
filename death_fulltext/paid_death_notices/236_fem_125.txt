        ROSE--Jessica. August 13, 2006. Acclaimed artist and self-taught jeweler fused sculpture and fashion in Soho galleries, Paris runways, Hollywood films and Tiffany's windows. Her work, like her spirit, was unorthodox, graceful and fun. Daughter of Dorothea Dessauer and Garth Williams, the illustrator of well-known children's books like Charlotte's Web, Jessica is missed by six siblings, ten nephews and nieces and many friends. The memorial at her Sag Harbor home is Sunday, September 24.
