        ZUCKERMAN--Matthew. We mourn the loss of a strong and gentle father, brother, grandfather and great-grandfather who served as a role model to his family. Beloved husband of the late Cookie and together with Ruth and Irwin Shapiro, Benefactors of the Hospital, Matt will be sorely missed. May the family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. American Committee for Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem
