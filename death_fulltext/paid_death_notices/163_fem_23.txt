        ZINSER-Barbara L. (Mrs. Hans). The Horticultural Society of New York has been honored & graced to have had Barbara as a member of the Board of Directors, serving in numerous capacities including Secretary, Treasurer, and on the executive, development and finance committees. She served on our Board for 36 years, or more than one-third of the 100 years of the Society's existence! She will always be a treasured part of the lore and legacy of the Society. She brought to the Society the interests of her father, also a longtime Board member, an incisive and quick intelligence, and her own singular brand and sense of humor. The Board and the Staff will miss her deeply.
