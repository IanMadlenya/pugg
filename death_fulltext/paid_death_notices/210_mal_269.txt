        WOLF--Richard M. Teachers College mourns the passing of Professor Emeritus Richard M. Wolf, a scholar of international standing, a teacher, a model to colleagues and a wonderful person. Throughout his thirty years at TC, he dedicated himself to students, fellow faculty and excellence in education. He was a giant and a mensch, and both are in short supply and should be cherished. His knowledge and experience cannot be replaced. Our condolences to his wife, Marie, his daughter Susan, his son Robert, and his daughter-in-law Barbara. Arthur Levine, President Teachers College, Columbia University
