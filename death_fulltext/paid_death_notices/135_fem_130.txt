        BENEROFE-Shirley. The Officers, Board of Directors and staff of UJA-Federation of New York, deeply mourn the passing of Shirley Benerofe, mother of Andrew, James and Mitchell, and motherin-law of Froma, Robin and Ada. Her dedication and long-standing commitment to many Jewish causes has been transferred to her children who carry on her tradition as strong community leaders. May you be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair Louise B. Greilsheimer, President Eric S. Goldschmidt, Chair Westchester General Campaign Stephen D.
