        BROWN-J. Carter. The Pritzker family and the trustees, jury and staff of The Hyatt Foundation mourn the loss of a dear friend who provided expert guidance as chairman of the Pritzker Architecture Prize jury since its inception in 1979. The prestige the prize has achieved must be credited in no small part to his dedication and vision, even when he had the enormous responsibility of directing the National Gallery of Art, along with countless other assignments that had great importance in the cultural world. He was a unique individual whose in-depth knowledge and creative energy made him an inspirational and irreplaceable leader. His brilliance and vision will be missed by all of us. Our deepest sympathies go to his loved ones. Thomas J. Pritzker Pres, The Hyatt Foundation The Pritzker Architecture Prize
