        SILBERMAN--Michael. The only son of the late Berl and Golda Silberman. Died suddenly on Friday, July 28, at the age of 71. He was the beloved brother of Sonia Kaufman, brother-in-law of Isaac Kaufman, loving uncle of Rabbi Lilly Kaufman and Berl Kaufman, and great-uncle of Leora Kaufman and the late Anna Kaufman. A graduate of Music and Art High School and of Cooper Union, Michael Silberman was an artist whose work appeared in national magazines, periodicals and books. He was a painter, and illustrator, designer and photographer. We hope and pray that his work will survive and live on. Services Sunday, at ''The Riverside,'' 76th St and Amsterdam Ave.
