        TRESCHER -- George. We profoundly mourn the loss of our leader. George was brilliant, charming, the orignal master in his field. We are in awe of his wisdom, his insight, and instincts. We feel so lucky to have learned from the best and to have worked along side this giant. Staff of George Trescher Associates >>AD#
