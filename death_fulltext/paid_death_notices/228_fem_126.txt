        WILDMAN--Edna. The Board of Directors and staff of the Kings Bay YM-YWHA mourn the passing of Edna Wildman who served as Executive Director of the Y for 24 years until her retirement in 2004. Edna was a highly respected member of the Jewish Community Center field. She was a mentor and confidante to Board members and staff. We will miss her personally and professionally.
