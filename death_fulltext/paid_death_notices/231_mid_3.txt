        QUICK--Regina. The trustees, faculty and staff of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory are deeply saddened at the passing of Regina (Jean) Clarkson Quick. Mrs. Quick was a generous supporter of the Laboratory, together with her husband, Leslie C. Quick, Jr., during his tenure on our Board of Trustees and after his death as well. Her vision for the future of our work and her kindness and friendship will never be forgotten. To her children, grandchildren, sister and many friends, we express our deepest sympathy.
