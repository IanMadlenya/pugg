        GIOVINE-Giulio. We mourn the loss of our friend and colleague, Giulio Giovine, 53, who passed away on October 20. His BNL colleagues will always remember him as a family loving man and as a loyal professional whose work ethics and dedication were inspirational. He will be dearly missed by his wife Rosa and his children Maria, Salvatore, Joseph and Domenico. A memorial mass will be held on October 31 at 9:30 AM at Our Lady of Pompei in Downtown Manhattan.
