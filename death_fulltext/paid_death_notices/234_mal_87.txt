        REDO--Frank, M.D. The Department of Surgery mourns the loss of our distinguished colleague, Dr. Frank Redo, Professor Emeritus of Surgery, who served as Chief of Pediatric Surgery for over 35 years. An internationally renowned pediatric surgeon, Dr. Redo earned his medical degree from Cornell University Medical College in 1950, and completed his internship and residency at The New York Hospital. Over the years he provided strong leadership and made significant contributions as a surgeon, researcher and teacher. We offer our deepest condolences to his wife Maria, his daughter Martha, his son Philip and daughter-in-law Jenette.
