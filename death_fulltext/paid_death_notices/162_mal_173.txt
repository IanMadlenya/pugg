        GOLDBERG-Steven Lewis, M.D. The Faculty and Residents of The Department of Pathology at SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, mourn the loss of our friend, colleague, and Faculty Member. An outstanding teacher and surgical pathologist, Dr. Goldberg's generosity, personal warmth, and willingness to share his knowledge, made every interaction with him a rewarding and stimulating one. He made an enormous contribution to our residency training program and to the pathology community at large. He will be deeply missed. We send our sincere condolences to his family, and to our colleagues at Staten Island University Hospital. Suzanne S. Mirra, M.D., Professor and Chair, Department of Pathology SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brklyn
