        GOOD--Robert A., M.D., Ph.D. The Jeffrey Modell Foundation has lost a cherished friend, the world has lost a brilliant immunologist, prolific author and gifted scientist. Our son, Jeffrey, knew him as his caring, compassionate, and dedicated physician. Dr. Robert Good, was an indomitable force for the understanding of Primary Immunodeficiencies for more than 55 years. He authored and coauthored over 2000 scientific papers, 50 books, received 13 honorary degrees and mentored and trained hundreds of students who would go on to have accomplished careers of their own. He performed the first successful bone marrow transplant to cure a child with a fatal PI disease, known as X-linked SCID. He gave all of us the most precious gift which is a greater understanding of disease to make all of our lives better for a brighter tomorrow. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Bibi and with his dear and wonderful family. Vicki & Fred Modell, Co-Founders Jeffrey Modell Foundation
