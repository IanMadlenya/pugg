        KOCH--Lynn Hurwitz, Ph.D. Mommy, what can I say? I wish I could say something. You should be with me, reading articles bearing my byline. This was not supposed to happen. I want you to know that my soul aches and that my life will never be the same without you. I am lost and incomplete. You were my best friend, not just my mother. This is a testament to the indisputable fact that you will always be the greatest mother in the entire world. You lived and died for others. You lived and died for your children. You lived and died for me. What more can a child ask for, than a mother who drops everything for her son? Mommy, my devotions, commitments, and passions became your devotions, commitments, and passions. You were loving, caring, sensitive, thoughtful, and selfless. Your cerebral accomplishments and diligence serve as a lifelong inspiration. There is nothing in the world you would not have done for me. There is nothing in the world you were not capable of. You served me, and I hope one day to serve you and your incredible legacy. My promise to you is that I will never let you down. You never let anyone down. You never let me down. My dedication to that which defines me, which therefore defined you, will never waver. I love you, all that you stand for, your being, and your character, more than life itself. I pledge to emulate all that has made you so cherished, wonderful, and missed. My interests will always be my interests, that is the most meaningful tribute to you. I will never give up on what you worked so hard at achieving for me. Trust that there will come a day when our hopes, dreams, successes, and accomplishments will be realized. You will always be inside me. There will always be only one mommy. You are the best. Words simply cannot express my love for you, and how sad I am. A part of me is dead. The world is grieving for the best. Dr. Lynn H. Koch; July 20, 1955March 10, 2005. With admiration and boundless love, L.J.
