        HIEBER-William G., Jr. The Board and staff of The Family Center mourn the sudden loss of our landlord, friend and father-figure Bill Hieber. He was first in line to help us serve families with AIDS and cancer. We will use his humor, strength and kindness to carry out and expand our work. Our hearts go out to Jean, Jennifer and Christina who are missing a gentle man who was full of life. Barbara Draimin, Executive Dir. Ivy Gamble-Cobb, Deputy Dir.
