        BERGER--Barbara G., Ph.D., on December 22, 2006, at age 81. Born in Cleveland, Ohio, she received her undergraduate degree from Cornell University and her doctorate from the University of Chicago. Trained as a clinical psychologist and therapist, she devoted years of dedicated service to her patients. Motivated by her sense of the fair and just, she supported many causes as well as individuals whose needs she sought to meet. A woman of independent mind and spirit, with a zest for life and strongly held views (sometimes provocatively rendered), she was open to and appreciative of the natural beauty of the world. She loved music and its rhythms, swimming and dancing. As a long-time resident, she loved her Greenwich Village neighborhood and her sunny apartment with the tree and garden outside her window. Preceded in death by her parents, Vera G. and Samuel S. Berger, and her brother, Peter S. Berger. Survived by her sister, Sally B. Matchneer, of Columbus, Ohio, and her niece, Catherine S. Bardsley (Wayne), of McLean, Virginia, and her great-nephews, Edward W. and Jeffrey D. Bardsley. She will be missed by her family and her caring friends and colleagues. Details of a memorial service will be announced at a future date.
