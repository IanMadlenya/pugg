        ANNENBERG-Walter H. The Members of the Royal Academy of Arts, the Trustees of the Royal Academy Trust and the Trustees of the American Associates of the Royal Academy Trust express great sadness at the passing of Ambassador Walter H. Annenberg. During their tenure at the Court of St. James's and in the years following, Ambassador and Mrs. Annenberg earned the deep affection and admiration of British society for their understanding and appreciation of British culture and their magnanimous efforts to preserve and promote British heritage. In May of this year, HM Queen Elizabeth II formally named the forecourt of Burlington House, the home of the Royal Academy, the ''Annenberg Courtyard'' in honor of the Annenbergs, whose generosity made possible the renovation of this magnificent public space. Throughout London, we enjoy the Annenbergs' beneficence, including the transformation of Winfield House into one of the most sumptuous residences in London. We are privileged that Mrs. Annenberg, who was a profound support in her husband's life, serves as a Trustee of the American Associates of the Royal Academy Trust. Ambassador Annenberg enriched us with his presence; he has left as his legacy those many gifts to the British people that will forever grace our lives. Prof. Phillip King, CBE, President of the Royal Academy of Arts Simon Robertson, Chairman of the Royal Academy Trust The Hon. Philip Lader, Chairman of the American Associates of the Royal Academy Trust
