        DUNBAUGH--Edwin Lane. Hofstra University is profoundly saddened by the death of Edwin Lane Dunbaugh, Ph.D., Distinguished Professor Emeritus of History who was an integral part of the Hofstra community since 1954 and who witnessed the growth of the University over the ensuing 50 years. Professor Dunbaugh was proud of his military service during WWII where he served as a naval medical corpsman. He graduated from Franklin and Marshall College cum laude and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He was a recipient of Fulbright Scholarship to the University of Vienna where he worked on his doctoral dissertation and received his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania. Professor Dunbaugh was not only a scholar of history, co-authoring a popular text, ''Mainstreams of Civilization,'' but also authored seven books on the history of steamboats, an abiding personal and intellectual interest which made him a leading scholar on the subject. Throughout his lengthy career, Professor Dunbaugh shared his great enthusiasm and passion for European History and the History of the Ancient World with his students. In 1970, in recognition of his exceptional skills as a teacher, the graduating class conferred upon him the prestigious and coveted Distinguished Teacher of the Year Award. He will be remembered by the Hofstra Community as a great scholar and devoted friend and will be greatly missed by his many students who became his lifelong friends. We extend our deepest sympathy to his family. In tribute to the memory of Professor Dunbaugh, all Hofstra University flags will be lowered to half staff. John D.
