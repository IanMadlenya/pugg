        COLER-Alexander. The American Technion Society (ATS) expresses its profound sorrow at the loss of Alexander Coler, a devoted supporter. As Technion Guardians, he and his wife, Tina, reached the highest level of commitment to the Technion, the ATS and Israel. He supported the Coler California Visitors Center on the campus, the Dorothy & Martin Kellner Amphitheater and numerous faculty recruitment efforts. A Life Trustee of the ATS Board of Regents, and an Honorary Life Member of the Technion International Board of Governors, Mr. Coler was honored with a fellowship from the Technion, and the Einstein Award from the ATS. As President of Coler Construction and Investment Company and C-D Investment Co., he presided over construction of the Los Angeles Airport Hilton, the Anaheim Hilton Hotel and Towers, and many other major projects. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Tina Coler and the entire Coler family. American Society for TechnionIsrael Institute of Technology Lawrence S. Jackier, President Irving A.
