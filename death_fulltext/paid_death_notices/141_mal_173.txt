        AMORY-Cleveland. The staff of Parade Publications, where he was a senior contributing editor to PARADE Magazine for more than 15 years, mourns the sudden death of our beloved friend and colleague. Cleveland's journalistic talents were as legendary as his love for animals. Although he claimed to be a curmudgeon, Cleveland was a deeply sensitive and caring man, who charmed everyone he met. His gracious style, wit and compassion will be sorely missed by all who knew him.
        AMORY-Cleveland, President of the Fund for Animals, who will be forever remembered for his wit, intelligence and tremendous efforts in making the world a less threatening place for so many of the animals he loved. His contributions to all of us were enormous. He will be loved and remembered forever. Judy and Edward Ney
