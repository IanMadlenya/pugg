        COOPER--Lucille H. April 26, 1921--August 12, 2005, in Los Angeles. Beloved wife of the late Norman Cooper (deceased 1978) and mother of Harriet Cooper, mother-inlaw of Neil Soltman, cherished grandmother of Nicholas and Joanna Cooper Soltman. Devoted daughter of the late Benjamin and Regina Harris and sister of the late George Harris, all of New York. Employed 25 years by NY Schools at PS 94 and Bayside HS in Queens, she retired in 1980 to Deerfield Beach, FL, where she married Benjamin Miller in 1988 (deceased 1994). In 1997 she moved to Canoga Park, CA. where she resided until her death. Lucille proudly completed her BA from Brooklyn College in 1980 (more than 40 years after she had begun). Articulate and opinionated, she wrote all the sing-along lyrics for extended Harris family gatherings, office festivities and friends. Honor and integrity, foremost among traits she admired, were exemplified in her by the 1937 ''All Around Camper'' Award bestowed by Camp Roosevelt, Monticello, NY, where she had met her husband Norman when she was 10 and he 11, and again when they were both camp counselors. She was an original, to be remembered and missed by her family and friends.
