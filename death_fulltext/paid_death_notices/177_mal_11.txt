        ALTMAN-Harry, Hazzan. The Cantors Assembly records with sorrow the passing of our revered colleague for over fifty years. Brilliant cantor with a magnificent voice, he quietly and gently served the spiritual needs of Congregation B'nai Israel of Freeport, Long Island for over four decades with dignity, warmth and care. His kindness, his humanity and his caring inspired us all. We extend our sympathy to his children Alan and Dr. Linda, his family and loved ones. May his memory abide as a blessing. Hazzan Sheldon Levin, President Hazzan Stephen J. Stein, Exec. VP Hazzan Abraham B. Shapiro Executive Administrator
