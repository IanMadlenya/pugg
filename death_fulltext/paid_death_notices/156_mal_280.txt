        BLOCH-Joel. New York City Opera mourns the passing of our good friend and colleague, Joel Bloch, who died in New York on January 8th of a massive heart attack at the age of 50, and was buried in Israel. As an artists' manager, he was an important member of the operatic community with an encyclopedic knowledge of opera repertory, who had built his carer through years of hard work and commitment. His judgment was acute, and his opinions, which he was never afraid to share, were often delivered with a razor-sharp sense of humor. He had an honest passion for and real love of the operatic art form and the human voice. Joel was tremendously supportive of New York City Opera and believed firmly in its goals and its mission. He was a real friend to all of us and we will miss him. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife Ilene, his daughters, and his many friends around the world. Paul Kellogg, General Director Robin Thompson, Director of Artistic Administration
