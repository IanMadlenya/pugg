        PELIKAN--Jaroslav. It is with deep sorrow that the American Academy of Arts andSciences mourns the loss of Jaroslav Pelikan, preeminent scholar of the humanities, wise interpreter of the modern university, and President of the Academy from 1994-1997. The leading historian of Christianity for more than fifty years, Jary's fivevolume study, The Christian Tradition, stands as an epic work. As President of our 226year-old society, he brought a deepened appreciation of the life of learning, a vision of excellence for all of our programs, and an understanding that knowledge and critical thinking are at the heart of constructive action. He continually reminded us that tradition has within itself the power of renewal; in his words, ''Authentic tradition is a function of the critical memory and the creative imagination. Only those who are truly educated have learned this art.'' We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Sylvia; his family, and all those touched by his grace, his generosity of spirit, and his extraordinary eloquence.
