        DILORENZO-Jeannette. The Officers and Retirees of The United Federation of Teachers mourn the passing of a friend, a dedicated Trade Union Leader and a superb educator. A long-time member of The Union, she served as Treasurer from 1972 to 1993, and then led The Retired Teachers Chapter where she championed educational programs and political activism. Her life's fight was for the dignity and well-being of all working people. She will be missed by all active and retired members of The UFT. Our condolences to her sister, Blanche, and her widespread family. Randi Weingarten, President United Federation of Teachers
