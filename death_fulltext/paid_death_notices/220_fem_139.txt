        HERRMANN--Marie A. It is with great sadness that The Inner-City Scholarship Fund Family notes the passing of a longtime friend. We are so grateful for her commitment to the girls and boys attending the inner-city schools of the Archdiocese of New York. Her generous spirit will never be forgotten. Our hearts go out to her family in this time of loss.
