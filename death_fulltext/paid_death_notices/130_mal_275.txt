His service as President, Chairman of our Funds for the Needy, member of the Scholarship Committee, Constitution Committee, and Executive Committee contributed in large measure to the success of the Brotherhood. Joe will be deeply missed by all of us who knew him and worked with him. We express our most heartfelt condolences to his wife and children, family and friends.
