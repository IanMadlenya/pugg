        SANDLER-Herman S. American Friends of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra's Board of Directors and staff and the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra-mourn the loss of our esteemed Board President, Herman S. Sandler whose life was lost in the attack on the World Trade Center. His consummate leadership, vision for the future and total commitment to the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra and the State of Israel will always be missed. We offer our heartfelt sympathy to his wife Suki; his daughters Pamela, Jordana, Gillian; his mother, and all the family. We cannot begin to describe the sadness of his loss. Herman was the inspiration and leader of the AFIPO family, our friend, who believed that the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra's role as a cultural ambassador would lead to world peace and understanding. On this Rosh Hashanah and in the years to come we shall remember Herman and his great contribution to us and to the world.
