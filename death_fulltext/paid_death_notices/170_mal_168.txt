        BRAND-Leonard, M.D. The faculty and staff of Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and New York-Presbyterian Hospital mourn the loss of our esteemed colleague Dr. Leonard Brand. Dr. Brand served the medical center for more than thirty years, contributing greatly to medical education, research, and practice. He was an outstanding educator, clinician and researcher who will be particularly remembered by the countless students and residents he trained. Dr. Brand was Professor Emeritus of Clinical Anesthesiology at the time of his death. We extend heartfelt condolences to the Brand family.
