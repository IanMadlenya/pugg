        SHERMAN-Victor. It is with deep sadness that the firm of Ochs & Goldberg, LLP mourns the loss of a friend and client. Victor was a legend in his industry and a mentor to all who knew him. Regardless of his age, Victor was always wise beyond his years. His loyalty, strength and courage were unmatched; particularly over the past two years as he waged the most courageous fight of his life. On a personal note, I already miss our early morning daily conversations and Victor's keen insight into all matters which impacted upon his life, family and his passion, ''Solco Plumbing''. I am eternally grateful for his loyalty, trust, and unbound confidence in me. You are truly a ''one of a kind'' individual and I will miss you. Mitchell Goldberg
