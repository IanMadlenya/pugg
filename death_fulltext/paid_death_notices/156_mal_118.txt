        BARSH-Jack. Age 87. In his sleep on January 6, 2000. Susan, his beloved wife of 36 years, and his family mourn his passing. ''Jake the Flying Tiger'' served in the Pacific during WWII and went on to hold several leadership positions in both the Greater Dental Society of New York and the ADA. From Jack's graduation from NYU to his last day of practice in 1986, he was an extraordinary dentist, a caring father and a loving husband. His sharp wit, intelligence, integrity and capacity for jokes will be sorely missed. Memorial services will be held January 9, 2000, 11AM at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81 Street. Interment at Kensico Cemetery on Sunday.
