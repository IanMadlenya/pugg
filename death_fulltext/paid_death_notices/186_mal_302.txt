        TARLOW-Jeffrey Abraham. Of Port Washington, New York, on July 27, 2002, after a courageous lifelong battle with tuberous sclerosis. Jeffrey never had a day without seizures, but still found reason to smile and make those around him happy. Jeffrey loved sports, and even completed the 1996 NYC marathon wheelchair division. He taught us all to strive for dignity in life and to accept nothing less. Jeffrey is survived by parents Gloria and Lawrence Tarlow, stepfather Ronald Rochester, sisters and brother Rachel, Thea, and Henry, and by many other relatives. In lieu of flowers, contributions can be made in Jeffrey's name to Hospice Care Network, 516-832-7100; or the Achilles Track Club of New York, 212-354-0300.
