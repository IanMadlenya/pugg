        WEINERMAN NEWMAN-Janet. The League Treatment Center family extends our deepest sympathy to her dear sister Roberta Brodfeld and her family: her daughter Ivy Newman, husband Howard and their children April and Brian, and her daughter Randi German, husband Jay and their sons Kenny and Keith. We extend our sympathy to her loving mother Emma. A wonderful sister and loving mother, Janet was a gifted pianist who brought joy to all.
