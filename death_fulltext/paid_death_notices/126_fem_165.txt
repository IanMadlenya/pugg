        KOPPELMAN-Ruth. A lifelong best friend and wife to Irving, a devoted, nurturing proud mother to Rosalind and Charles, a kind, caring mother-in-law to Edward and Bunny, an encouraging, involved grandmother to Lawrence, Suzanne, Karyn, Brian, Stacy and Jennifer, and a loving great-grandmother to Samantha, Jonathan, Alexander, Benjamin, Joanna, Sophie, Nicole, Samuel, Gerald, Harrison and Jack. Ruth died on July 19, she was 84 years old. Ruth was a teacher, mentor in the purist forms of those words. Always available to listen and advise. Her compassion, intellect and heart were a constant comfort to her family. She was the letter writer, the record keeper, the family historian, the person whose love and support were always unconditionally given. Grandma never started a conversation without asking after the health of the entire brood, and never ended one without expressing her love for us. She will be profoundly missed. We will live to honor her name. Good luck, Grandma. We love you. Service 11:15 AM, today at ''The Riverside,'' 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, NYC
