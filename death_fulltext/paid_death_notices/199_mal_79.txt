        BAKER--Julius. The Juilliard community profoundly mourns the death of Julius Baker, a member of the Juilliard faculty from 1954 to 2003, and one of the most prominent flutists and distinguished teachers of the 20th Century. With impeccable technique, expressive sound, flawless phrasing, and great imagination, Julius Baker brought the art of flute playing to new and unexpected levels. As a teacher, he worked with future generations of principal orchestral players, chamber musicians and solo artists who now perform on the world's stages. His quick wit and warm personality will be deeply missed, but his legacy continues through his teaching and through his performances. We send our deepest condolences to his beloved wife, Ruth, his children, and his many friends. A service will be held on Sunday, August 10, 2003, at 2 PM in The Old Southeast Church in Brewster, NY.
