        BRAITHWAITE-Arnold. The William F. Ryan Community Health Center is deeply saddened by the death of Arnold Braithwaite. Arnold was a true friend of the Ryan Center, giving generously of his unparalleled wisdom and guidance as a member and officer of the Board of Directors for more than 25 years. With Arnold at the helm, the Ryan Center gained stature as a model community health center recognized by local, state and federal officials. In 1988, under Arnold's leadership, the Ryan Center successfully moved to its new, state of the art facility thus dramatically increasing the center's ability to serve the poor and uninsured. Throughout the struggling years of the community health center movement, Arnold was an inspiration to many by remaining faithful to his principles and never compromising his values. His dedication and lifelong commitment in improving the lives of impoverished minority populations has made an indelible contribution to community health centers across the country, and his warmth, enthusiasm, and kindness will be greatly missed by friends, colleagues, and the community. Our thoughts and love are with his wife, Hope; his son, Ryan; and his grandchildren, Tatiana, Tiye, and Jahi. Viewing services will be held on Friday, September 12 from 2-8 PM at Unity Funeral Chapel, 2352 Eighth Avenue, corner of West 126 Street. Funeral services will be held on Saturday, September 13 at 11 AM at St. Luke's Episcopal Church, Convent Avenue and 145 Street. Condolences may be sent to Hope Braithwaite and family, 120 West 97th Street, Apartment 8J, New York, New York 10025. A memorial service for Mr. Braithwaite will be held at Ryan in the coming weeks.
