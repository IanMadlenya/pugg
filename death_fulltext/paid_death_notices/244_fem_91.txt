        BOWERS--Akiko Kobayashi, born Tokyo, Japan, died May 4, 2007, Pompton Plains, New Jersey. A graduate of Kobe College, she came to New York to study business at NYU in 1961. She was the first female Director of Protocol to the Japanese Ambassador to the United Nations. In 1970, she married Dr. John Z. Bowers, then President of the Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation. Their mutual love for Japan and Asia led to many fruitful and fondly remembered years spent researching, translating and editing his scholarly works. Her philanthropic endeavors included the John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor and Dean's Chair at the University of Maryland Medical School, and endowed scholarships at Dr. Bowers' alma maters, Gettysburg College and the University of Maryland. The Metropolitan Museum of Art and Gettysburg College include heirlooms from her family in their collections. Her memoirs ''East and West, When the Twain Meet -a Life'' were published in Japan in 1999. In 2003 she received an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Gettysburg College. In itself, her life was a bridge between the East and West.
