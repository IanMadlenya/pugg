        RAGER--Frederick A. Jr, died at home in NYC on January 14th, 2004. He was born in Vienna, Austria in 1928. His father, Frederick Sr, a Nazi resister, was Secretary of the Chamber of Labor of Austria, and moved the family to London in 1939 and then to the US in 1940. Fred graduated from The Peddie School in Hightstown, NJ and earned his degree from Wesleyan University in 1948. At Wesleyan, he was a member of Psi Upsilon fraternity, and later was president of the Wesleyan Psi Upsilon Alumni Association. Upon graduation he worked briefly at the Emhart Manufacturing Co, and in 1949 joined The Hanover Bank in NYC. From 1950 to 1952, he served in Korea as a corporal in the US Army, and subsequently rejoined the bank. He built an impeccable 37-year career in corporate banking as successive mergers led to the formation of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, a predecessor of today's JP Morgan Chase. At the time of his retirement from Manufacturers Hanover in 1986, he was Senior VP of the bank's National Division and one of its most respected credit officers. He also distinguished himself during his long career by recruiting and mentoring scores of young bankers; they and Fred's many friends and former colleagues will remember him with great affection. He is survived by an elder brother, Peter, and a niece and nephew.
