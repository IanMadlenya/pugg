        DIENER-Beatrice. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Marjorie Diener-Blenden and Larry Diener on the passing of their beloved mother. Our sympathies to her sister Toby Greller. A longtime member of the National Women's Division and a Diamond Founder, together with her late husband, Leonard, Beatrice personified the highest standards of Tzedakah and Chesed in her love and support of important Jewish causes that build and strengthen Israel. May Marjorie, Larry, Toby, and the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. American Committee for Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem
