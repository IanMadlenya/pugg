        PETINA-Irra. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of Irra Petina, a stalwart member of our company for 13 seasons between 1933 and 1950. Following her debut as Schwertleite in ''Die Walkuere,'' she sang 38 roles, including Carmen, in 444 performances with our company. She was much admired for her lively characterizations and keen gift for comedy in many supporting roles. We extend our deepest condolences to her family and friends. Joseph Volpe, General Manager James Levine, Artistic Director
