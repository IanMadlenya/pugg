        THURNAUER--William. The Board of Directors and staff of the JCC on the Palisades are greatly saddened by the passing of William Thurnauer, a JCC trustee whose lifetime dedication to music led him and his late wife, Maria, to endow the JCC Music School that bears their name. A kind and generous supporter of musicians of all ages, Bill enabled the JCC Thurnauer School of Music to give the gift of music to thousands of children in our community. Our deepest condolences go to his dear wife, Lilo, his children Andrew and Joan, and his grandchildren. Daniel Rubin, President Avi A. Lewinson, Exec. Dir.
