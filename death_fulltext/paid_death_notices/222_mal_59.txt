        ZEFF--Kal. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) mourn the loss of Kal Zeff of Englewood, CO, a generous and loyal friend. A Technion alumnus, Mr. Zeff served on the ATS National Board of Directors and was a chair of the Denver Chapter. A civil engineer, he used the knowledge he gained at the Technion to found Geotek Consultants, and Carmel Companies, Colorado's largest locally owned real estate development and management company. Demonstrating his gratitude to the Technion, he and his beloved wife, Joyce, Technion Guardians, became major supporters of the recently opened Yitzhak Rabin Civil and Environmental Engineering Building. Their equally generous Kal Zeff Post - Doctoral Fellowship supports the work of many outstanding scientists. We extend our sincere condolences to Joyce, children Dana, Diana, Michael and Ron, and the entire Zeff family. American Society for Technion-Israel Institute of Technology Stephen A.
