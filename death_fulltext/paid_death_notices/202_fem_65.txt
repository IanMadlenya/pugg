        MALONE--Nola Langner, 73, award-winnng illustrator/author of children's books. Nola's prolific career encompassed five decades and more than 30 books, her pioneering artistic style characterized by the use of muted washes-a radical departure from the garish colors conventional to the genre up till then. Of heart failure, in her sleep, Tuesday, October 28. She will be sadly missed by her former husband and five children.
