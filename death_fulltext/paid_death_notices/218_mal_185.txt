        LESTER--William. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) mourn the loss of William Lester of Westfield, N.J. and Delray Beach, FL. A founding member of the organization and a life trustee of the Board of Regents, Dr. Lester was a steadfast and inspiring friend for more than 50 years. He was a brilliant engineer and businessman who launched three successful plastics companies and was a moving force in the growth of the Technion since his first visit there in 1952. Together with his wife, Gloria, he became a Technion Guardian, representing the highest level of commitment to the ATS, the Technion and Israel. Their dedication of the William and Gloria Lester Wing for Optical Information Processing and Communications in the Irwin and Joan Jacobs Center for Communication and Information Technology has helped position the Technion and Israel as leaders in global communications. In recognition of his exemplary dedication, en gineering achievements and unique history, Dr. Lester was awarded a Technion honorary fellowship in 1991, followed by an honorary doctorate in 1999. We extend our condolences to his wife Gloria, and to his and his late first wife Betty's children Gay Freda Gertz, Kenneth Lester, and the entire Lester family.
