        FARMER-James. The officers, members & staff of the American Jewish Committee mourn the death of James Farmer, one of our nation's most prominent and influential civil rights leaders. In 1994, AJC honored him with our Public Service Award for his lifetime of dedication as a valiant champion for civil rights & social justice. We have lost a crusader for non-violence and pacifism, a great moral thinker and activist, and a man who identified with the suffering of all peoples in their pursuit of equality & human rights. He maintained a particularly close association with and affection for the Jewish people, working to assure a mutually respectful and mutually beneficial relationship. We send our sincere condolences to his grieving family. Bruce M. Ramer, President David A. Harris, Exec Director
