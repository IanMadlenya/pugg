        HAMMER--Peter. A mathematician of international stature, died on December 27, 2006. He was born in Romania in 1936, and earned his Ph.D. under Academician Grigore Moisil. After he married Anca Ivanescu in 1961, the two defected to Israel. There, he was a professor at the Technion in Haifa. He then moved to Canada in 1969, and taught at the University of Montreal, later at the University of Waterloo. He moved to New Jersey in 1983, where he founded the Rutgers Center for Operations Research. Professor Hammer was Editor-in-Chief of four major Operations Research journals; wrote more than 240 papers; and co-authored books including the landmark Boolean Methods in O.R. and Related Areas and the forthcoming Theory of Boolean Functions. He invented a novel, effective method of data interpretation which he called Logical Analysis of Data (LAD), applied today in a myriad of fields. In recognition of his talent, he received numerous distinctions: the George Tzitzeica prize of Romanian Academy of Sciences; the Euler Medal from Institute of Combinatorics & Its Applications; and honorary degrees from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, the University of Rome (La Sapienza), and the University of Liege. He was named Fellow, American Association for the Advancement of Science, and founding fellow of the Institute of Combinatorics & Its Applications. Several conferences were dedicated to him: Chexbres, Haifa (Caesareea Rotthchild Institute), and Leukerbad. He supervised numerous graduate students with respect and fatherly understanding, considering each of them as his best student. He was a loving husband, father and grandfather. He will be missed by everyone who knew him. Always, forever.
