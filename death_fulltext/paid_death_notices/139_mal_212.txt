        SULLIVAN-Christopher M. Words are never enough. The entire staff of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center mourns the death of their dear friend, colleague and confidant, Christopher Sullivan. He moved through our complex world with the ease and grace of an international diplomat -assuring each of us that our problem was foremost on his mind. Chris joined the staff of Memorial SloanKettering in 1990 as Manager of Employee Relations. He spent the next eight years enhancing our everyday work lives. He leaves a legacy of appreciation and admiration from thousands of Memorial Sloan-Kettering staff members. Chris will be greatly missed. To his son, Daniel, and to the entire Sullivan family, we extend our heartfelt condolences. Paul A. Marks, M.D., President John R. Gunn, Executive Vice President Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
