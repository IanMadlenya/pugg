        FOSTER -- Colonel Rafe Robert. Deputy chief counsel, administrative law division, office of The Judge Advocate General, age 42, died Thursday, September 4, 2003 after a brave battle with cancer, surrounded by his loving family. No words can carry the sweetness and strength of Rafe's character, the power and clarity of his mind, the truth and honesty of his life. Rafe was profoundly devoted to his family, to the military, and to his Jewish heritage, serving on the board of the Jewish congregation at Fort Belvoir, VA. He held himself to the highest standards, graduating first in his college class, attaining a full scholarship to law school, and earning the rank of colonel in May 2003. He had a wide-ranging and embracing intelligence, a direct and purposeful manner, and an unerring moral compass. Yet he retained his childhood sense of wonderment at the world and a deep belief in the goodness of mankind. Rafe was known by all for his clever and gleeful sense of humor, that at times he enjoyed more than anyone. And he measured the success of his stories and anecdotes by the laughter he inspired. Those who loved him are left with the joy and extraordinary privilege of having known him and with the unbearable sorrow of not having had more time. As his presence added so much to our lives, his absence leaves his family and friends a future that will never be as rich, an emptiness that can never be filled, hearts that can never mend and a world that is less kind and less special. Rafe loved and was beloved by his wife Ingela, his sons Jacob and Daniel, his parents Israel Howard and Estelle, his brother Michael and his sisters Stacy, Tamar, and Jody. Though he was with us a short time, he will be missed forever.
