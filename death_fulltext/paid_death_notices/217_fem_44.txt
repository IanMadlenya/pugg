        GELMAN -- Anna Cheskis. The faculty, students, alumni and staff of Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health are deeply saddened by the loss of our beloved Professor Emerita Anna Cheskis Gelman. Her dedication to the School and to Columbia's students extended beyond the classroom. She served as director of student affairs, editor of the first alumni directory and a founder of both the alumni and student government associations. Her dedication to public health and her love of teaching were extraordinary. A pioneering epidemiologist for over 60 years, Professor Gelman was teacher, mentor and friend to countless students, and her devotion to the School was unparalleled. Her contributions to the School include the establishment of the Gelman Professorship in the Department of Epidemiology in honor of her late husband. She also established the Gelman Laboratory Suite for Infectious Disease Research in the Jerome L. and Dawn Greene Infectious Disease Laboratory. She was a remarkable woman and we are the less for her passing. A memorial service will be held this spring on the Columbia University Medical Center campus. In lieu of flowers, it was her request that contributions in her memory be made to either the Mailman School's Fund for Public Health Leadership, or to support the Gelman Laboratory. For further information please contact the School at 212-305-6083. Allan Rosenfield, M.D., Dean
