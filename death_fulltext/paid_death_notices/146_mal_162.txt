        WARDWELL-Allen. The staff of Christie's Inc. in New York expresses their profound sorrow and offers support to Allen's wife, Sally, children and grandchildren. Allen was a respected and cherished colleague whose enthusiasm and pure love of the arts were an inspiration to us all. At Christie's he was an integral part of our specialist team adding invaluable knowledge to our American Indian and Tribal Art Departments. He will forever be remembered for his zest for life and his passion for art.
