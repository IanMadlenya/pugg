        FINBERG--Barbara D. A national figure in the non-profit world, an authority on children's needs, serving at the prestigious Carnegie Corporation, for some thirty-eight years, beginning as a program officer, later to become Executive Vice President. From that base, she became nationally respected for her role as a foundation executive who inspired generations of young people in their careers, tutored unskilled professionals seeking funds, nurtured fledgling new organizations, and restructured those older ones needing redirection. Her seminal work with Carnegie has led to new evidence that the earlier the intervention, the better the child's chances to be a fully functioning adult. She kept that focus throughout her career, and retiring from Carnegie, became a founding member, as Vice President, of MEM Associates, Inc., a non-profit consulting group concerned with the health and welfare of children and adults. In private and public life, Barbara Finberg was a model of what to be, by setting standards of measure of what a good life should be. Margaret E. Mahoney, President, MEM Associates Inc.
