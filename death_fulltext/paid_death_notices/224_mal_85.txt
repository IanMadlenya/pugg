        LEONE--Raffaele Anthony, July 5, 1923-September 5, 2005. ''The Great Ralph'' left his inscription all over the Bronx neighborhood as a little boy and thus began a family legend, our greatest character. Devoted son and brother, loyal husband of Madeline of 55 years, beloved father of Dr. Frank Leone (Lucy) and the late Adele Leone Monaco (Richard), cherished grandfather of Darsi, Francis, Marietta, Renata, and Joseph. After graduating NYU he transformed his father's manufacturing company into the Raffaele label, dressing the most beautiful women of his time. Upon retirement he worked at his daughter's side as a literary agent, endearing people with his gentle, persistent nature. Ralph loved New York, loved the Bronx; he will be remembered as a man of great intelligence, style and grace, who rarely left the house without his shirt and tie, enormous eyes brimming with life and love. ''...we'll be looking at the moon, but we'll be seeing you...''
