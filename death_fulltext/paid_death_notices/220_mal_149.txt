        HECHT--Kal, died in peace on May 13, 2005 at his daughter's home in Miami. These are his own words: ''I graduated from Lafayette College in June of 1941. As Salutatorian of my class, I gave a speech at our commencement exercises urging that the United States enter World War II on the side of Great Britain. I entered the US Navy a few days later. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, I was a newly commissioned ensign serving aboard the USS President Adams. Eventually, I participated in the invasion of Guadalcanal. After the war, I received an MS degree from the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University and worked as a reporter and editor of newspapers in Pennsylvania and Connecticut. Then I went to Europe. I studied French and Spanish, fell in love with Europe, and stayed there for the next 30 years. I live in a building bordering the sea in Fort Lauderdale. Each day I look out to sea as I did 60 years ago on islands in the Pacific.'' Kal remains in the hearts of daughter Lisa Hecht-Cronstedt, sister Florence Savin, niece Irene Hecht and cousin William Troy and Susan Troy. May your brilliance shine on your final voyage. Fare well.
