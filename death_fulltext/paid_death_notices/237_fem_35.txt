        SCHWARTZ--Mildred. We at The Institute for Contemporary Psychotherapy (ICP), mourn the death on October 4, 2006 of our honored colleague, mentor, and friend, Mildred Schwartz. Dr. Schwartz's gift to this Institute was her timely vision thirtyfive years ago in initiating its beginnings, and her unstinting guidance in creating a pre-eminent center of psychoanalytic psychotherapy training for mental health professionals and the treatment of the under-served. Dr. Schwartz's strength in presenting her views, and her openness to new ideas widened the scope of the Institute, which grew from a handful of candidates and clients to an institution with eight divisions consisting of 300 trainees, therapists, faculty, supervisors and administrators. With her direction, ICP graduated many hundreds of professionals and treated over 25,000 New Yorkers in need. Decades ago, her clinical vision identified issues and problems in living that were not yet part of the social vernacular. Dr. Schwartz was deeply committed to both incisive thinking and humanistic values. She combined the rigors of training and service, along with a sense of family among the Institute's participants. Your colleagues miss the clarity of your ideas, Millie, and your patients miss your ability to listen and to deeply care.
        SCHWARTZ--Mildred. On October 4, 2006. Sadly missed by loving family, friends and colleagues. She is survived by her son Paul Schwartz, daughter Emily Calamita, son-in-law Bill, granddaughters Sarah and Olivia. Her memory and wisdom will remain in our hearts forever. Service Friday, 11:45 AM at ''The Riverside,'' 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue.
