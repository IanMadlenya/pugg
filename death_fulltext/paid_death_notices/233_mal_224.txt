        CLARK--Hays. The Trustees, Life Trustees, Physicians and Staff of New York-Presbyterian Hospital and the Overseers, Faculty and Staff of Weill Medical College of Cornell University are deeply saddened by the passing of our dear friend Hays Clark. Mr. Clark was elected Governor of The Society of the New York Hospital in 1971, Life Governor in 1988 and Life Trustee of New York-Presbyterian Hospital in 1998. He enthusiastically championed and generously supported the shared missions of the Hospital and Medical College. Involved in numerous areas of governance, including clinical, finance and operations, he also endowed a professorship in pathology in honor of David D. Thompson, M.D. Energetic and dedicated, Mr. Clark will be greatly missed. He is survived by his wife, Rosamund Seidel Clark, and his brother James Clark, a Hospital Life Trustee. Our deepest condolences are extended to the entire Clark family. John J. Mack Chairman, Board of Trustees Dr. Herbert Pardes President and CEO NY-Presbyterian Hospital Sanford I.
