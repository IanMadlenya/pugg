        PRAWER-Murray. The law firm of Heller, Jacobs & Kamlet, formerly known as Thurm & Heller, with deepest sorrow, mourn the loss of Murray Prawer, our former Partner and cherished friend. Everyone who had the privilege of knowing Muz, loved him: he was a man whose love of his family, devotion to colleagues and friends, and compassion towards all was a true inspiration and model for us to follow. We extend our heartfelt sympathy and condolences to his loving wife, Lisa; his children, Noah, Ben and Emily; his mother, Lola; his sisters, Naomi and Renee; and to all of his family and friends, whose lives he touched in so many wonderful ways. We will share with you in honoring his memory in worship at Temple Beth Rashon, Wyckoff, NJ on Thursday, August 22, at noon
        PRAWER - Murray. Muz: You're the funniest, sweetest, bravest guy we know. Claudia and Mitch Bloch Fran and Dan Heyman
