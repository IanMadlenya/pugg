        MAYER--Manfred. The Yeshiva University family is saddened by the passing of a distinguished community leader and YU Guardian who, with his late wife, Eva, established a course in Jewish History at Stern College for Women, and had a long and generous relationship with our institution. Heartfelt condolences are extended to his children, David and Paulette Mayer, and his grandchildren, Rachel and Jack. May they all be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Richard M. Joel, President Norman Lamm, Chancellor Morry Weiss, Chairman Board of Trustees
