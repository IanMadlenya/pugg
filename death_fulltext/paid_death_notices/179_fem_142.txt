        COHEN-Florence. The Cohen family deeply mourns the loss of their heart and soul, Florence Cohen, of Larchmont, NY on December 21 at age 75. Cherished wife of Martin, affectionate sister of Leah, loving mother of Jason and Jo Ann, Larry and Susan, and Liz and Steven, and adored grandmother of Julia, Danny, Jessie, Cassie, Alex, Matt, and Ethan. A true ''city girl'', Florence was born and raised in New York City surrounded by scores of Sugarman relatives. While attending Hunter College, she formed friendships for life with Barbara, Seena, Sydell, and her sorority sisters. As an educator and psychologist, Florence profoundly touched thousands of lives. With Martin, she traveled the world many times, from the Arctic to Antartica. Florence tirelessly supported the Brandeis University National Women's Committee, for which she served with distinction as chapter and then regional president. If you measure your life by the depth and breadth of your relationships with others, then Florence enjoyed unrivaled success her entire life. Her memory lives on through her many wonderful friends and extended family. Her warm, generous, charitable, and fun-loving ways will be missed always. Memorial contributions may be made to NARAL or Brandeis University National Women's Committee. Services Sunday, December 23, 11:30am at Schwartz Brothers, 11403 Queens Blvd, Forest Hills, NY.
