        KING--Coretta Scott. The Foundation for Ethnic Understanding mourns the passing of the first lady of the civil rights movement who championed her late husband's legacy of human rights and the strengthening of black-Jewish relations. To our cherished partner and supporter, Martin Luther King III, and to the entire family, our heartfelt sympathy. May her memory encourage people of all faiths and ethnicities to continue the struggle for justice and freedom. Rabbi Marc Schneier, Pres. Russell Simmons, Chairman Lawrence D. Kopp, Exec. Dir.
