        MADDEN--Audrey. The Brooklyn Botanic Garden mourns the passing, on May 12, of our dear friend and colleague Audrey Madden. She retired from our Board of Trustees in 2003 after 20 years of devoted service. She always brought good humor, intelligence and great affection to all of her work at the Garden and will be sorely missed. We extend our deepest sympathy to her family. Earl D. Weiner, Board Chairman Judith D. Zuk, President Kate Doran, Aux. President
