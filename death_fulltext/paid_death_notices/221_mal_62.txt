        IMBER--Isaac. The community of West End Synagogue is deeply saddened by the death of founding member Isaac Imber and extends its condolences to his family and to his beloved companion Esther Heyman. Isaac's was a rare spirit, full of wonder and awe, coupled with an abiding commitment to scholarship. A poet of grace and wit, and a real estate professional, he also served as director of the American desk of the Haganah from 1947 to 1949. We will miss him greatly.
