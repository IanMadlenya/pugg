        HERLING-Erwin. The Yeshiva University family mourns the passing of our esteemed friend and honorary alumnus who, as a YU Benefactor, expressed his love and concern for the future of the Jewish people through the advancement of higher Jewish education at our institution. This commitment was expressed through the endowment of scholarships and fellowships at YU and its affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his beloved wife, Tova, and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University David S. Gottesman, Chairman Board of Trustees
