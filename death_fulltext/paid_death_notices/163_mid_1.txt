        KUPIETZKY-Fanny. The Yeshiva University family marks with sadness the passing of a highly respected member of the Jewish community, wife of the late Rabbi Jacob H. Kupietzky, mother of Rabbi Jonah, a loyal YC and RIETS alumnus, who together with his wife Fran are YU Guardians and RIETS Fellows and who established the Rabbi Jacob H. Memorial Rabbinic Scholarship, RIETS Fellows and YU alumni Nachman (and Elke), Channy (and Dr. Abe) Greenberg, and Moishe (and Arlene) all of whom established the Keren Nachlas Yaakov Foundation Rabbinic Scholarship at RIETS for the study of Kodshim, grandmother and great grandmother. Her matriarchal presence will be sorely missed by the family and the community. May the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Dr. Norman Lamm, President Robert M. Beren, Chairman Board of Trustees
