        $(6$)Alexander--Norman E. The American Jewish Committee mourns with great sadness the passing of Norman Alexander, a dear friend, a member of our Board of Governors, and an AJC Honorary Vice President. A captain of industry, Norman brought his wide-ranging talents to the task of advancing the agenda of the American Jewish Committee and the greater Jewish cause. At AJC, for many decades, he demonstrated particularly keen interest in strengthening the Jewish future and ensuring the safety and security of the people and State of Israel. He was a pioneer and path-breaker with regard to investing in Israels economy, encouraging others to do the same. Norman was a member of many AJC Commissions, including AJCs Commentary Publication Committee. All of us at AJC were uplifted by his wisdom, leadership, friendship, counsel, and passionate participation. He will be sorely missed. We send our heartfelt condolences to his dear and devoted wife Marjorie; to his children Gail, Sharon, Mark and Leslie; and to his grandchildren Deborah, Daniel, Rachel, Courtney and Benjamin. E. Robert Goodkind, President David A. Harris, Executive Director Shulamith Bahat, Associate Executive Director
