        MECKEL-Wilfred J. July 14, 2000 at the age of 87. He died peacefully from Leukemia, which became aggressive in the last two months. Originally from Corona and then from Jackson Heights in Queens, his middle years were spent in Garden City and the golden ones in Baiting Hollow, NY. His wife of 61 years Emily, his son Billy and daughter Emilyann, his daughterin-law Gail, son-in-law David and his wonderful grandchildren Alexandra, Karina, Brad, Amanda and John are all saddened by his passing and will miss him forever. But living on is his genuine warmth, his friendliness toward all and the joy he always found in the simplest aspects of life. His family appreciates the kindness of Dr. Steven Spiegel and the Westhampton Care Center. For his love of children, he requested that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to Little Flower Children's Services in Wading River, NY. He will repose at Fairchild Funeral Home at 12 Street in Garden City, New York 2-5PM and 7-9PM Sunday. A funeral Mass will be celebrated on July 17 at St. Joseph's Church in Garden City at 11AM.
