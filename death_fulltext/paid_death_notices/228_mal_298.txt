        BOBROW--Louis. The Chernobyl children mourn the passing of the father of Norman Bobrow, a dear friend and cherished supporter. His caring, wisdom and wit will be missed by all who knew him. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Ida, his children, and his wonderful grandchildren and greatgrandchildren. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
