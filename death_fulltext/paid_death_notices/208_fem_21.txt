        TOPF--Eve. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) are deeply saddened by the loss of Eve Topf of Aventura, FL, beloved wife of Samuel B. Topf, one of our towering leaders. The Topfs are Technion Guardians who have reached the highest level of commitment to the ATS, the Technion and Israel, and their generosity is evident throughout the Technion campus. Most recently, they were instrumental in developing the Eve Topf Neurodegenerative Disease Research and Teaching Center, inspired by Mrs. Topf's valiant struggle with Parkinson's Disease and dedicated to the eradication of this and other neurodegenerative diseases. From the Sam and Eve Topf/ Miami Dormitory Fund and the Sam and Eve Topf Miami Manufacturing Entrepreneurial Center and the new companies it has spawned, to the Southern Region Technion Emergency Fund for Soviet Absorption and vital student scholarship funds, Eve and Sam Topf were for decades inspiring in their unwavering commitment. We extend our heartfelt condolences to her husband Sam; their children and their spouses Joel and Pat Weissman, Rhona and Gary Leggiere, Steven and 753nne Weissman, Frances and Barry Hesser, Jeffrey and Mary Topf; their grandchildren and great grandchildren; and the entire Topf family. American Society for Technion-Israel Institute of Technology Dr. Stephen A. Laser, President Evelyn Berger, Chairman of The Board Melvyn H. Bloom, Executive Vice President Jonathan I. Kislak, South Florida Chapter Chair Senator Paul B. Steinberg, South Florida Chapter President Albert G. Effrat, Southern Region Director
