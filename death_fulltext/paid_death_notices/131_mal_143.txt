        DANIEL-William. The Union of American Hebrew Congregations deeply mourns the passing of our colleague and friend Bill Daniel. A true advocate of the philosophy of outreach, it was his generosity and spirit that was the foundation of The William and Lottie Daniel Department of Outreach. Bill was a long-time member of the Board of Trustees and his involvement, leadership and love of Reform Judaism will be deeply missed. Rabbi Eric H. Yoffie, President Jerome H. Somers, Chairman Board of Trustees, Union of American Hebrew Congregations
