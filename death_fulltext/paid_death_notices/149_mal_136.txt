        DILLON-George S. The volunteers and staff of the March of Dimes note with sorrow the passing of our former Chairman of the Board of Trustees and longtime friend. Mr. Dillon, a volunteer for nearly 40 years, was a member of the Board from 1972 to 1990 and served as Chairman from 1980 to 1984. From 1990 he served as an Honorary Trustee. His dedication to excellence in our biomedical research program and his concern for saving babies from birth defects, prematurity, and low birth weight will be greatly missed. Our deep condolences to his family. Jennifer L. Howse, Ph.D., President Richard J. Freeman, Chairman
