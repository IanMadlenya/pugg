        LLOYD-Maria. The Board of Directors of the Marcella Sembrich Opera Museum mourns the death of our great friend, Maria Lloyd. Her husband, David Lloyd, is a former President of our Museum in Bolton Landing (New York) on Lake George, and Mrs. Lloyd was an invaluable supporter of our efforts for many years. We offer our condolences to her family and also to our friends and colleagues in the musical communities that gather each summer at Lake George, where her absence will be a heartfelt loss.
