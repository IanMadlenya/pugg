        ELISHIS--David. A great light has been extinguished. A giant in faith, goodness and love of his family. Our sincerest nichumim to Brenda, Isser, Sara, Avi and their spouses and children. He will be missed and always remembered by the entire Reishit family. Rav Jay, Rav Ari, Rav Elie, Rav Doni, Marcus Yerushalayim and Beit Shemesh, Israel
