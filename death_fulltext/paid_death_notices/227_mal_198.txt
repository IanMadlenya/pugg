        ISHIKAWA - Rokuro. The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn the passing of Dr. Rokuro Ishikawa, who has been a devoted friend and colleague for the past twenty years. He served as honorary trustee and was also chairman--and in recent years chairman emeritus--of the Museum's International Business Committee. His impressive leadership of a major fundraising effort enabled the Metropolitan to put on display its extensive collection of Japanese arms and armor in newly renovated galleries. We extend our sympathies to his entire family. James R. Houghton, Chairman Philippe de Montebello, Director Emily K. Rafferty, President
