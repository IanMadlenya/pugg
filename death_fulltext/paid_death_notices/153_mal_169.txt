        SANOFF-Frank. A kind, gracious person who epitomized the definition of the word-gentleman. Always pleasant. Unfailingly polite. A fine businessman with whom it was a pleasure to do business. A man of his word which is so rare in todays economic environment. We will miss him. We offer our deepest respects to his wife and to his children, and the entire Sanoff family. Jerome Belson, President Nicholas La Porte, Jr. Executive Director Associated Builders and Owners of Greater New York, Inc.
