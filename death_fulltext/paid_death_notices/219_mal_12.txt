        COCHRAN--Johnnie, L., Jr. We are saddened by the passing of our dear and noble friend. His courtroom achievements were but a small part of the great and good work he did for societies oppressed, his church and people of all color. A fine, decent and moral man, we are diminished by his death. Our sincerest condolences to Dale, her family and the children. The Weitz Family Tanya, Harvey, Andrew and Paul
