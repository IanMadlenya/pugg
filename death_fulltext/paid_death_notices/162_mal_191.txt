        LEWIS-Frederick Howell. On behalf of The Fresh Air Fund, we note with great sadness the death of Frederick Howell Lewis, Life Director of The Fund. For 25 years, Bud was The Fund's Executive Director until his retirement in 1971. His leadership of our Friendly Town program enable thousands of young New Yorkers to visit volunteer host families in 13 states and Canada. In addition, Bud helped establish The Fund's 3000-acre Sharpe Reservation in upstate New York, the site of five Fresh Air camps. Countless numbers of inner-city children have benefited from his vision, generosity and compassion. We offer his family our heartfelt condolences. Mrs. Donald Newhouse Chairman of the Board Jenny Morgenthau Executive Director The Fresh Air Fund
