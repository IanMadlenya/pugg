        MALLIN-Gilda and Ralph. The National Board of Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, mourns the tragic loss of Gilda Mallin, President of the Boca West Chapter of Hadassah, and of her beloved husband Ralph, who perished on SwissAir Flight 111. A Hadassah life member, Gilda celebrated her Bat Mitzvah at the 1995 National Convention in Miami; together the couple generously supported Hadassah. We extend our deepest condolences to their children and grandchildren. Marlene E. Post, Nat'l President Dr. Laura S. Schor, Nat'l Executive Director
