        GOLDSTEIN-Stacy. Homemaker and vice president of StaVal, Inc., E&S Sales of Union, NJ, resident of Peapack, NJ, passed away on December 3, 2001 at age 37 after battling breast cancer for 12 years, but she was like that/a fighter. Stacy was everything to her husband for 13 years, Robert, and to her son Jonah, her parents, Ed and Sue, and to her sister Valerie. She also meant so much to so many. Stacy was generous, in the truest sense of the word. She took care of others before she thought of herself. Stacy made her life full of music, laughter, and storytelling, and she gave all of this as a gift to everyone who met her. Even now, when the world is a sadder place without her, she is warming the hearts of her family and friends. In lieu of flowers, donations to The Valerie Fund.
