        BALANCIA--Charles. The President, the Board of Trustees, and the entire staff at Montefiore Medical Center are profoundly saddened by the death of Charles Balancia, senior vice president of engineering. ''Charlie'' worked at Montefiore for 48 years and had a hand in raising every building on our campus and developing the engineering systems for the entire medical center. Blessed with mechanical gifts, a teacher who taught by example, Charlie was also a deeply caring human being who mentored and inspired all who worked with him. He was passionate about doing good for Montefiore's patients, neighbors, and colleagues, and full of ideas for helping others. Awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Mosholu Montefiore Community Center in 2006, Charlie served in many ways to better the world around him, not only as an engineer and administrator at Montefiore, but also as councilman and then mayor of his hometown in Harrison, N.Y., as a member of the board of directors of SUNY Maritime College, and as a volunteer and civic activist. We will miss him deeply. Our heartfelt condolences and warmest sympathies are extended to his wife, Rosemarie; his children, Angelo, Teresa, Charles, and Guy; and his entire family. Spencer Foreman, MD. President Jay B. Langner, Chairman Board of Trustees Montefiore Medical Center
