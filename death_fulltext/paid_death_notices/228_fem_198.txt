        MAYNARD -- Joan Cooper Bacchus. The Trustees and staff of the Weeksville Heritage Center mourn the passing of our Founding Executive Director, a visionary who reclaimed a part of Brooklyn's history to provide a legacy for future generations. Founded as the Society for the Preservation of Weeksville and Bedford Stuyvesant History, Weeksville tells the story of 19th and early 20th Century African American life beginning in the 1830's. Joan's vision means the story will be told for centuries to come. She was an inspiration to us all and to others across the nation. Penny Fujiko Willgerodt, President Pamela E. Green, Director
