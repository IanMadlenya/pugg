        HOROWITZ--Raymond. The partners, counsel, associates and staff of Graubard Miller greatly mourn the passing of our esteemed Counsel and former partner of many years, Raymond J. Horowitz, and extend our deepest sympathy to his daughter, Judith Babcock and to his sister, Edith King. We lose a friend and will miss his intelligence, wise counsel and sophistication in both the law and the arts. The art world loses a fervent collector and patron who dedicated himself to the dissemination of knowledge and appreciation of fine art. Graubard Miller
