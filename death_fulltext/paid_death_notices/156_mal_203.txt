        EDELSTEIN-Jonathan, M.D. The entire Phelps Memorial Hospital Center community mourns the passing of our beloved friend, colleague and mentor, Jonathan Edelstein, M.D. He was a superb surgeon whose professional dedication, skill and integrity were surpassed only by his humanity, sincerity and love of life. He was an active member of the medical staff for nearly 30 years, serving as President of the Medical Staff and Chief of General Surgery. In addition to his large clinical practice, he supported many community projects including The Ossining Open Door Health Center, The Ossining Volunteer Ambulance Corps and The Clear View School. An active sportsman, skier, sailor, auto mechanic, electrician, carpenter and gardener, he amazed his family, friends and colleagues with the breadth of his enthusiasm and talents. Our deepest condolences go to his beloved wife, Linda; daughters Andrea and Jaime and the rest of his family. James McGroddy, PhD, Chairman, Board of Directors Keith F. Safian, FACHE President, Chief Executive Officer, Lawrence L. Faltz, M.D., FACP Medical Director Jeffrey Altholz, M.D. President of the Medical Staff
