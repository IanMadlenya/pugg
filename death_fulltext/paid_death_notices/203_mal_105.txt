        KENNEY--Stephen G. The Stratton Community mourns the loss of Stephen ''Stevek'' Kenney, a longtime member of the Stratton family. Stevek was the inspiration and energy behind our Allegro and Freestyle programs, sharing his passion for the sport of freestyle skiing and enriching the lives of hundreds of young people. He was coach, mentor and so much more. In his 30 years at Stratton, Stevek was at the heart of an extended family that transcends time and distance. Stevek personified those values we hold deeply and that we hope to pass on to our children, friends, and family. We are blessed for the opportunity to have had Stevek in our lives. Our thoughts and prayers are with all his family and friends in this most difficult time.
        KENNEY--Stephen G. Stevek made everyone in his life feel like they were his best friend. His limitless devotion to his Stratton Freestyle Team and Allegro Family was truly inspirational. He was our coach, confidante, guardian, enforcer, teacher, organizer, joke teller, a trainer of young minds, and giver of the world's greatest hugs-our loss is profound. To honor Stevek, we will keep his dreams alive, ski through our tears, and remember a unique soul who will live in our hearts forever. Debbie, Shelly, Alexis, Brent & Jared Palmer
