        RUKIN-Eleanore. The Jewish Braille Institute of America mourns the passing of a loving and caring trustee, Eleanore Rukin. Her lifetime of advancing good causes through her talents, charisma and generosity endeared her to many. Even before she lost her eyesight in recent years, she and her late husband David supported our Institute's work. In her later years she was an enthusiastic builder of our services for the blind and visually impaired in South Palm Beach County. We join her family in grief and hope that the beauty of her memory will help ease the great sorrow of her loss. Barbara B. Friedman, President Gerald M. Kass, Executive VP
