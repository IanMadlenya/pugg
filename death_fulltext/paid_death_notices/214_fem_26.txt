        MUNGER -- Dorothy. The house of Steinway & Sons notes with great sorrow the passing of the American pianist, Dorothy Munger, in Indianapolis on November 5, 2004 at the age of 89. Dorothy Munger was a member of our Steinway Artist family for more than fifty years. Born in Fostoria, Ohio, Mrs. Munger started piano lessons at the age of six and while in Junior High School provided music for silent films. She also regularly accompanied Charles Munger, an older boy who played trumpet, and years later she and Charlie married. Dorothy was for many years principal pianist of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra, and she was one of the most beloved teachers and mentors in the country. Dorothy Munger was a member of the Steinway Artists' Committee for the Steinway Centennial in 1953, and she was a cherished friend to our firm throughout her life. We will miss her, and we extend our heartfelt condolences to Nancy, Jim, and her entire family. Bruce A. Stevens, President Peter B. Goodrich, VP, Worldwide Concert & Artist Activities
