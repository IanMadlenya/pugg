        GILSOUL-Benoit. June 1914-December 17, 2000. We mourn his passing, and extend our sincere sympathy to Edith, Mireille, and Marc. The religious and secular interiors he created in numerous public buildings in the USA in association with major American architects, in stained glass, tapestry, and sculpture will convey his deep spirirtuality to posterity, Christian and Jewish. We lost a creative artist, a unique human being, and wonderful friend. Lotte and Herbert Strauss Berlin/New York
