        WEISS-Robin. Beloved wife of my loving brother, Andrew S. Weiss. Her spirit will be in our hearts forever. In her courageous battle for life she showed devotion. To be with her was an inspiration. She gave so much of herself and left a legacy of bravery and strength. There will never be darkness because her light will always shine. An angel on earth whose halo warmed everyone's heart is now with God. Robin, you will forever be a blessing. We love you. Your big sister Janie Weiss Sturman, Leon Sturman, and your loving nieces, Amanda and Laura Schwartz.
