        BOBB--Sophie. After 95 exceptional years, Sophie exited life as she had lived it, independently and fiercely determined to steer her own course. A graduate of Hunter College and Columbia Graduate School, she joined the Waves at the start of WWII. Her mother's death brought her back from Hawaii and out of the service to care for her father until his death in 1961. Devotion to family and friends was paramount to her, closely followed by her love for education. She was a teacher and active member of UFT, whose cause she championed. Each organization she joined benefited from her commitment to excellence. Throughout her life, she held numerous responsible jobs in the Pythian Sisters, Hadassah, Hollywood Arts and Culture Council and most important to her Brandeis University National Women's Council. Sophie will be sorely missed and long remembered by her many nieces, nephews, friends and colleagues.
