His professionalism, passion for his work, kindness and wisdom will forever be valued. He was a gentle man, generous of spirit, tenacious in his quest to ''right a wrong'' or to fight an injustice, a man of all seasons, and a good citizen of the world. Our deepest condolences to his wife, family and friends.
