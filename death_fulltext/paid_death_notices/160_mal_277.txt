        BANGSER-Lawrence S. The partners, counsel, associates and staff of Bangser Klein Rocca and Blum, LLP, mourn the loss of our friend, counsel and former partner. We are proud to have had him as our role model and as our leader for much of the 52 years we practised law together. He had great courage, strength, vitality and judgement. We will sorely miss him. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to his wife, Phyllis, his children, Hank, Mike and Maggie, and their families.
