        SAFRA-Edmond J. Yad Avraham Institute, its Officers, Directors and members record with deep sorrow and mourn the tragic and untimely loss of our beloved and esteemed patron. For the past decade, he provided a home for us with love and enthusiasm in his Beit Yaakov Synagogue. His support enabled Yad Avraham, an institution devoted to teaching Torah, to grow and flourish. In his merit, thousands have passed through its portals to partake of the wellspring of Torah, and hundreds have returned as committed Jews. He asked little, yet gave so much. We will sorely miss him. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his beloved wife Lily, her children and grandchildren and the entire Safra family. May all those touched by his chesed be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Rabbi Yosef Kalatsky, Dean David S. Lobel, President Bruce Rappaport, Major Benefactor Ira Rennert, Director Louis Glick, Director Yad Avraham Institute
