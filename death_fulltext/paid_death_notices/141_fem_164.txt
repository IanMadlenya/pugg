        SAPIR-Fannie. AMIT is deeply grieved by the passing of the beloved mother of our dedicated Board of Directors member, Harriet Seif, who together with her devoted husband Heshi, are magnanimous benefactors of our AMIT children in Israel. A righteous woman of valor, Fannie Sapir epitimized courage, compassion, family and Torah values. May her memory be a blessing to her children, grandchildren and Klal Yisrael. May the family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Evelyn Blachor, National Pres. Marvin Leff, Executive Dir.
