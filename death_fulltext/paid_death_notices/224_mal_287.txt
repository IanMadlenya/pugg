        FUTTER--Victor. Hofstra University and its School of Law are deeply saddened by the death of Victor Futter, special counsel to the dean and a professor of law for almost two decades. Professor Futter generously contributed his talent and time to Hofstra, serving as a mentor, guide, teacher and friend. He was both wise and compassionate, giving of himself and asking little in return. In recent years, he helped develop the Center for Children, Families and the Law, taught and wrote about nonprofit law, and spearheaded the organization of a major conference on corporate governance. There was nobody more energetic or more enthusiastic about the potential of law schools to do good than Victor Futter. The entire Hofstra University community extends its deepest sympathy to his family. He will be greatly missed. In tribute to the memory of Professor Futter all Hofstra University flags have been lowered to half staff.

        $(6$)FUTTER--Victor. We mourn the passing of Victor Futter, a longtime member of the American Society of Corporate Secretaries where he was President of its New York Chapter, a member of the Board of Directors, and received its highest honor, the Bracebridge H. Young Distinguished Service Award. Vic was a friend to all and a mentor to so many. He was, until the very end, a leader, teacher and author. We will miss him. Our thoughts and prayers go out to Joan and the entire Futter family. The Board of Directors
