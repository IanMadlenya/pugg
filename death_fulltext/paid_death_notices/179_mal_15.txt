        MATZNER-Yaacov. American Friends of The Hebrew University and The Hebrew University of Jerusalem are deeply saddened by the tragic and sudden loss of Professor Yaacov Matzner, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at The Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem. A distinguished physician and scientist, Professor Matzner received worldwide recognition for his research on leukemia and lymphoma, and he was presented with the Bayer-Pfizer Award and the Wolfson Research Award, as well as being honored by the European Society for Clinical Investigation. He also served as Head of the Hematology Unit at the HadassahUniversity Mt. Scopus Hospital. Professor Matzner was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Medicine in 2000, overseeing activities of the Faculty's five Schools. In his all too brief tenure, he made enormous strides as a visionary leader of a complex enterprise as well as securing needed resources for medical research and teaching. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife Linesya, 2 children Hagai and Yonit, and the entire family. American Friends of The Hebrew University Ira Lee Sorkin, President Keith L. Sachs, Chairman of The Board of Directors The Hebrew University of Jerusalem Professor Menachem Magidor, President Professor Haim D. Rabinowitch, Rector Yigal Arnon, Chairman of the Board of Governors
