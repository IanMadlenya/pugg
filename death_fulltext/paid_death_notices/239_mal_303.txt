        STANTON--Frank. With deep sadness we regret the loss of Dr. Frank Stanton, long time board member and esteemed friend of Lincoln Center Institute. As in all aspects of Frank's life, he not only served with distinction, he led with distinction. From his good counsel of Lincoln Center Institute's Founding Director, Mark Schubart, to his ongoing support of the board as a whole, Frank deserves major credit for the Institute being what it is today. His wisdom, generosity, keen intellect, and piquant sense of humor will be sorely missed by all of us who were fortunate enough to have served with a visionary of his caliber. Above all, he cared about children. May he rest in peace. Susan Rudin, Chairman Scott Noppe-Brandon, Executive Director
