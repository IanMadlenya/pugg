        FIERMAN-Merwyn I. All of us at Greiner-Maltz are terribly saddened by the loss of Mike, our dear friend and associate for over forty years. He was the consummate deal maker and an inspiring and dynamic force in our firm. We shall deeply miss his leadership, creativity and sense of humor. His absence will leave a permanent void in our hearts. We all extend our deepest condolences to his wife Mary and his children. Bill Greiner, Dick Maltz, John Maltz, Larry Reiff, and all the staff and associates at Greiner-Maltz Real Estate.
