        MURPHY-Michael J. The 35,000 members of the alumni, students, faculty and staff of John Jay College of Criminal Justice note with profound sorrow the passing of Michael J. Murphy, the first Acting President of John Jay College of Criminal Justice and the pioneering law enforcement leader. As New York City Police Commissioner, he had the foresight and courage to fight for the establishment of the nation's first and only college dedicated to the education and professionalization of policing. A recipient of the college's Presidential Medal, he was a tremendous supporter in the early development of John Jay College and remained so throughout its history. The law enforcement community has lost a strong advocate for progressive policing in America. We extend our heartfelt condolences to the Murphy family. Gerald W. Lynch, President John Jay College of Criminal Justice, The City University of New York
