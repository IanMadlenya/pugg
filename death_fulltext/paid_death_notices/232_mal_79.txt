        BLINDER--Abe L. The Board and Staff of the Alliance of Resident Theatres/New York mourn the passing of our beloved Board Member, Abe Blinder. We were blessed that Abe served on our Board for twenty-two years, eventually being elected Treasurer and Vice-Chair. He brought to the organization great humor, wisdom, and an unmatched fundraising tenacity. He was a passionate theatergoer who endeared himself to everyone he came in contact with, including countless members of the theater community. He taught all of us vital lessons, not only about running A.R.T./New York, but about living life with exuberance and integrity. He will be profoundly missed. Our hearts go out to his wonderful companion, Babette Gruenberg, his sons, Henry, Jon, and all of his family and friends. Peter A. Cross, Board Chair Robert LuPone, Board President Ginny Louloudes, Executive Director
