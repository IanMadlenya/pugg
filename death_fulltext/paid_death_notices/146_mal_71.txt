        TALBERT-William F. The Board of Directors and staff of the International Tennis Hall of Fame mourn the loss of our friend, Chairman Emeritus, and 1967 Hall of Fame inductee. Bill Talbert was not only a great friend to our organization, but a true champion and leader of the sport of tennis. Through his contributions to the game, not only as a player, but as Davis Cup coach, author and as Tournament Director, and driving force behind the U.S. Open, he was affectionately known as ''Mr. Tennis.'' A warm, gracious and committed supporter of tennis, Billy will be deeply missed by all who knew him. We extend our deepest sympathy to his sons, W. Pike and W. Pike, and family.
