        KRAMER--Lola. We mourn the loss of a treasured friend. We will miss her intelligence, her sparkling wit, and her extraordinary courage. She will remain an inspiration for her compassion, her philanthropy, and her devotion to friends and family. Our sincere condolences to her beloved husband, Saul, her devoted children, Robert and Kathie, and her adored grandchildren. The world will be a colder and darker place without her. Marjorie and Jack Schleifer
