        AUGENSTEIN--William C. It is with great sadness that Royal Pet Supplies announces the sudden passing of William (Billy) C. Augenstein, president and owner, on Sunday, April 18, 2004. Billy was born in New York on May 29, 1952. Billy is survived by his mother, Irene, brother Stephen, nieces Jennifer and Sara, and nephew Ryan. A memorial celebration of Billy's life will be held at the Huntington Hilton on Sunday, April 25, 2004, at 12:30 PM. There will be an opportunity for anyone wanting to ''say a few words'' or ''tell a brief story'' to help all of us come to grips with Billy's tragic passing. The family requests that in lieu of flowers, donations should be made to the BideA-Wee Foundation, 410 East 38 St., New York, NY 10016, Attn: Donations. Billy Augenstein was bigger than life, a man of great vision, a remarkable leader, a true motivator and a close friend to all.
