        PERSKY--Mary E. (Betty). Passed away January 27, 2006 at Arden Courts in Tampa. Betty came to Tampa in 2003 after residing in Naples for several years. She moved to Naples from Pepper Pike, Ohio in 1986 with her late husband, Dr. Lester Persky. She was predeceased by her husband, her parents Mike and Catharine Connor and her sisters Peg McGahuey and Frances Armstrong. She is survived by her children: sons Dr. David Persky (Mary) of Tampa, Dr. James Persky (Cindy) of Cleveland, Ohio; daughter Katherine Persky of New York City; grandchildren Zachary, Paige, Rachel, Allison and Abigail and several nieces and nephews. A native of New Jersey, Betty attended Catholic school in Elizabeth and went on to obtain her nursing degree at St. Vincent's Hospital in New York. She served in the U.S. Navy during World War II as a Navy nurse and was honorably discharged. She used her GI Bill benefits to complete her college education at Boston University and settled down to raise her family after relocating to Cleveland, Ohio. As her children grew, Betty returned to nursing for several years as the school nurse at Hathaway Brown School in Shaker Heights. The family extends their sincere thanks to the staff of Arden Courts, LifePath Hospice and VC Family Staffing for their efforts in the care of Betty. The family will receive friends at Hunter's Green Country Club from 6:30 to 8:30 P.M. on Tuesday, January 31. A memorial service will be held in Cleveland, Ohio at a later date. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests a charitable donation to the Alzheimer's Support Network of Naples, Florida, LifePath Hospice or a charitable organization of your own choosing.
