        VEIT--Ivan, 96. His daughter Lenore Veit Gale, his six grandchildren, and their families were fortunate to have been graced for so many years by his gentle dignity, incisive intelligence, modesty, loyalty, chocolate mousse, dry wit, disciplined approach to gardening, and literate observations of life. Even more than to his alma mater Columbia College, his World War II service in the U.S. Navy, or his lifelong career at the New York Times, he was devoted to his extended families and his enduring friendships. We will not forget his generous and steadfast spirit. Contributions in his memory may be made to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
