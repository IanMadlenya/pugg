        SCHACTER-Barbara Cameron, on January 26, 1997. A beautiful person both inside and out, who touched everyone in her own very special way. A devoted and wonderful friend who will live on not only in my heart, but also in the hearts of all those who knew and loved her. Barbara, I will miss you and I will always love you.
