        ROTHENBERG-Lillian. Passed away July 23, 2001. Dearest and closest friend, we will miss our wonderful Wednesdays together visiting museums, art galleries, theaters, music and dance performances. We will miss her sense of humor, her artistic talent, her generosity of spirit and her always being there to listen. Claire and Paul Finkel
