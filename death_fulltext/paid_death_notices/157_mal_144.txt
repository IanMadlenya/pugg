        ALLISON-Billy Gene. 67. Family and friends deeply mourn his passing on February 12. Following a distinguished U.S. Army career, his interest in physical conditioning and exercise led him to become a personal trainer in NYC with a large and loyal following. Known for his rapier wit and love of words, he was also a dedicated outdoorsman and experienced woodsman. In addition to his loving companion, Holly Drew of NY, he is survived by his mother, Verna Allison of Overland Park, KS; by a daughter Cynthia Jangel and her family, Jeff, Allison and Scott of Claremont, NH; and by two sisters, Barbara and Cheryl, and a brother, Roger. Services will be held in Claremont, NH. A memorial service will be held at the Unitarian Church of All Souls at 1157 Lexington Ave., NYC, on Sunday, February 20, at 2 PM. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the national or a local chapter of the Humane Society.
