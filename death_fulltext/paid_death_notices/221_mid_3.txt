        ELBAUM--Izak. The American Friends of the Ghetto Fighters Museum share in the sorrow of our devoted Board member, Trudy Elbaum Gottesman, and her entire family on the passing of her beloved father. The legacy of Izak's life as a Holocaust survivor who rebuilt his life and created a warm and loving Jewish home is a great inspiration to us all. Amy Miller, President Debbie Nahshon, Exec. Dir.
