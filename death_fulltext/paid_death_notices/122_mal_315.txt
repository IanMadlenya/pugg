        LORINCZI-George G. In memory of our esteemed partner and colleague whose courage and brilliance was an inspiration to so many. His leadership in international law and his commitment to the development of Eastern Europe made him a central figure in the privatization of state enterprises in Hungary. In addition to founding our Budapest office, he was active in international relations and human rights advocacy. We pay tribute to his integrity, grace and unique character and extend our deepest sympathy to his children and grandchildren. The public memorial will be held on Thursday, April 3 at 2 PM at Cedar Lane Unitarian Church, 9601 Cedar Lane, Bethesda, MD 301-493-8300.
