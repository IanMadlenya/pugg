        KNIPE--Andrew T. There is a saying, ''Adversity doesn't build character, it reveals character.'' This perfectly captures the spirit of our friend and work mate, Andrew T. Knipe, who passed away Saturday after a long battle with ALS, a neurological ailment also know as Lou Gehrig's disease. He was 38. After being diagnosed in 2000, Andy pursued a tireless schedule of speeches, videos and fund-raising efforts for research and patient care. He was always optimistic and positive. Never down or self pitying, he made a point of trying to make sure his friends and family were okay. A remarkable soul. Andy joined the BBDO advertising agency after winning the prestigious Rich Martel Award. He created awardwinning and acclaimed work for many of our clients, including Pepsi, HBO, FedEx and the NJ Devils. At the agency's annual meeting several months ago, Andy was recognized with the Founder's Award. The outpouring of emotion for him as he accepted was overwhelming. Over the past few weeks as Andy's condition worsened, scores of BBDOers reached out to him with hospital visits, notes and emails. He felt our love and support. His brother, Rich, wrote a note to Andy's friends at BBDO the other day: ''I would like everyone to please see this as Andy getting out of jail. He was wrongfully accused but served a five year sentence gracefully, productively and with dignity. Although we will all miss him, none of us will miss what that relentless disease did to him. Andrew told many of us that when he dreamt at night, he was always well. Walking, talking and without pain. Now his dreams have become a continual reality.'' Goodbye from your family at BBDO, Andy, we'll miss you.
