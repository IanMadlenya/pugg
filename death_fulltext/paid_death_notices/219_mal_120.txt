        SEBBA -- Samuel. Yeshiva University and its Bernard Revel Graduate School of Jewish Studies mourn the loss of this distinguished Jewish leader and philanthropist who was a founding member of the Board of Directors of BRGS. From his homes in London and Israel, Mr. Sebba generously supported many institutions of higher education under Jewish auspices over the course of his long and active life. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel, President Norman Lamm, Chancellor Morry J. Weiss, Chairman YU Board of Trustees Mordecai D. Katz, Chairman BRGS Board of Directors Arthur Hyman, BRGS Dean
