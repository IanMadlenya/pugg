        STILLMAN--Linda A. It is with great sadness that the Service Guild of Long Island Jewish Medical Center notes the passing of Linda Stillman, past president, on July 14, 2005. Raised in the leadership tradition of her family, Linda generously shared her vision and infectious enthusiasm with the hospital volunteers, physicians and administrative staff whom she considered family. When she came to the LIJ Service Guild in the 1990s, she quickly rose to the presidency, serving two terms as president from 1996-2000. Her enthusiasm and vision resulted in innovative yet practical benefits to LIJ patients and their families. We offer our condolences to her devoted husband Ronald and her children Michael, Rose and Jonathan, their families and her beloved sister, Joan Levy. Funeral services will take place on Sunday, July 17 at 12:30 PM at Riverside-Nassau North Chapels, 55 North Station Plaza (opposite LIRR), Great Neck, NY.
