        CITRIN--Estelle. Mom, today was a special day in the life of both of your grandchildren. Ethan, who it seems was born just yesterday, graduated into high school. His intelligence, his warmth and his love of life are proof positive that he is yours. Hunter moved up to sixth grade with your humor and your craziness. Like you, however, he is smart and always looking to the next project. They miss you terribly and would have been blessed had they actually known you in life. It feels like yesterday when we had our last breakfast together near the law School. Our lives will never be the same without you in them. In my thoughts always, Love, Marc
