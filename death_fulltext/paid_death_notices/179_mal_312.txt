        SCHAAP-Dick. The ALS Association, Greater New York Chapter, mourns the loss of our very good friend and supporter. He was a tireless and generous worker on behalf of our organization in the fight against Lou Gehrig's disease, and one of the founding partners in our Lou Gehrig Sports Awards Benefit. He will be greatly missed. We extend our deepest sympathy to his family. Alan Griffith, Chairman John L. Ernst, Chair Emeritus Dorine Gordon, President Lauri Novick, Exec. Director
