        WANG--Florence Wu, beloved wife of Cheng Ching and devoted mother of Vera and Kenneth died peacefully early Saturday morning, the 17th of January surrounded by her immediate family. She was born in 1918 in China, the youngest daughter of General Wu Jing Biao, military governor of Jiangxi province and Wu Yue Shin. Born at a time before the Communist Revolution when women were not necessarily encouraged to pursue higher learning, she completed all of her studies including earning her B.A. degree from Xi Nan University. After her marriage in 1939 she fled mainland China via India due to the Communist takeover to join her husband in the U.S., where she served as a translator for the United Nations. Long recognized for her extraordinary innate style and aesthetic flair, with a passion for the arts and education, she embraced her new life in her adopted country and instilled similar values in her children. She served as an early inspiration for her daughter's activities as a fashion designer and remained an active supporter until her passing. Her husband Cheng Ching, daughter Vera Wang Becker, son Kenneth, five grandchildren and sister Diana survive her. In lieu of flowers donations may be made to the New York Presbyterian Hospital in the name of Florence Wu Wang. Friends may call at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue, on Wednesday, January 28th, from 6pm to 9pm. Funeral private.
