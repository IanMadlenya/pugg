        MUELLER--George C., M.D., of Charleston, SC (formerly of Montauk and New York, NY) died peacefully at the age of 92 on August 22. Dr. Mueller was a retired Professor of Otolaryngology at the Cornell University School of Medicine and Attending Surgeon at The New York Hospital, where he spent his entire professional career except for his military service. During World War II, he served as a flight surgeon with the Flying Tigers stationed in the China, Burma, and India Theater. His unit provided fighter cover for Merrill's Marauders as well as for transports flying over ''the hump.'' At the airfield when a fighter plane crash-landed, Dr. Mueller led the rescue of the injured pilot trapped within the burning plane. Thereafter he was awarded the Soldier's Medal for Bravery. Later in the war, he was sole survivor of an aircraft crash and was promoted to the rank of Major. He married Frances McGrath, who died 29 years later, and is survived by his second wife, Laura Forrester Mueller, by his daughter, Helene Weld, by his son-in-law, Dr. Francis Weld, and by three grandchildren, Francis Jr., Alexandra and Margaret. A memorial service will be held on Saturday, October 11th at 9:30AM at St. Vincent Ferrer Church, Lexington Avenue at 65 St, New York City. This will be followed by a graveside service at The Most Holy Trinity Cemetery, East Hampton, NY. In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to The Animal Rescue Fund, PO Box 901, Wainscott, New York 11975.
