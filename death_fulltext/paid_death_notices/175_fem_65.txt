        ANNER-Winifred McGrath, 90 years old, died peacefully at home on August 7, 2001. Mrs. Anner was born in the Bronx to William and Catherine McGrath. She married John L. Anner, Jr. in October 1932, and he died December 26, 1937. She is survived by her daughters Kathryn and husband Marvin Goldsmith, Mary Alice and her husband John Heaney, her son John L. Anner III and his wife Rosemarie, and her daughter Winifred and her husband William Gunsalus. She is the much beloved grandmother and inspiration to her fifteen grandchildren and their husbands and wives. Her grandson Peter Heaney died in 1985. She is also survived by twenty-three great-grandchildren. She was a school secretary with the NYC Board of Education for over thirty years. Winifred was a good sport; an avid NY Knicks fan; and loved reading the NY Times, clipping articles of interest for her large family. John Anner, her very beloved husband quoted the following when he asked her hand in marriage: ''A perfect woman, nobly planned, to warn, to comfort and command, and yet a spirit still and bright, With something of an angel light.'' Winifred embodied all these qualities as she raised her children, and had a warm, wonderful relationship with her grandchildren and great-grandchildren. The family will receive friends and family at Farenga Bros Inc. 920 Allerton Ave, Bronx, NY Wednesday and Thursday 2-5 and 7-9 PM. Mass of Christian Burial at Holy Rosary Church.
