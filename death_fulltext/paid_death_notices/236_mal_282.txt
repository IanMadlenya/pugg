        KOPPEL--Yehuda. The Hillel family notes with sadness the passing of Yehuda Koppel of New York City. We are forever indebted to proud Zionists like Mr. Koppel who believed in, and risked their life for, the creation of the State of Israel. The seeds he planted allowed Israel to grow and flourish. We extend our deepest sympathies to his daughter, Abigail Koppel Wexner, and sonin-law, Leslie H. Wexner, and to the entire Koppel family. May the marvelous legacy he left for the Jewish people give them comfort at this difficult time. Edgar M. Bronfman, Lynn Schusterman, Michael Steinhardt, Hillel International Board of Governors
