        BARNETT-Rabbi Isidore. We mourn the death of our beloved colleague, age 94. He served pulpits in Savannah, Georgia and in the Philadelphia area, retiring from Beth Uziel in 1971. After retirement, he continued to serve as a chaplain of Inglis House in Philadelphia until his second retirement in 1988. We extend our deepest condolences to his children, Judith Winter and Arthur Barnett and to all who were touched through his rabbinate. Rabbi Vernon H. Kurtz, President Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Exec. V.P. The Rabbinical Assembly
