        TABACHNIK-Rabbi Joseph. We mourn with profound sorrow the passing of our beloved colleague. Ordained in 1946, his first pulpit was in New Haven. In 1963, he was called to the pulpit of West Suburban Temple Har-Zion in Chicago, which he served until he became its Rabbi Emeritus in 1989. He served the RA both as convention chairman and chairman of our Joint Placement Commission. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Miriam, sister, Yetta Segal and children Emanuel, Rena Viner and Naomi Kayne and to all who were touched through his rabbinate. Rabbi Vernon H. Kurtz, President Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Exec VP The Rabbinical Assembly
