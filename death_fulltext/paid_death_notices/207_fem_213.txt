        WALLER--Jeanne P. The East End Hospice Board of Directors, staff and volunteers mourn the loss of Jeanne P. Waller, founding member of the Board of Directors, hospice patron and valued friend. In addition to her many contributions as Board member and volunteer, Jeanne was the driving force behind founding the thrift shop whose proceeds support Camp Good Grief, a cause close to Jeanne's heart. Jeanne's spirit and energy was unmatched. We shall miss her greatly. We extend our deepest sympathy to her children Nancy, Linda, William; her grandchildren, family and to her many friends. Priscilla Ruffin, Exec Dir W. Michael Pitcher, President, Board of Directors East End Hospice Westhampton Beach, NY
