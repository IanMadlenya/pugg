        WEISS-Helen. AMIT mour ns the passing of Helen Weiss, mother of William and Louis and mother-inlaw of our dear Senior Vice President and Executive Board Member Marion. Helen was an esteemed member of AMIT, and devoted to the cause of saving Israel's forgotten children. She was a true friend. May her family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
