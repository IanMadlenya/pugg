        GOLDBERG-Sylvia Herzog, 88. Died on July 5, 2000. She lost her beloved Moe, her husband of fiftynine years, in 1996. Devoted mother to Ethel and Larry Prospect, Leila and Bob Strassler. Dear sister of Pauline Kassier. Cherished grandmother to Michael and Melanie Prospect, Steven Echtman, Ted and Lindsay Prospect, Barry and Sybil Echtman, Elyse and Daniel Berger, and Elisa and Scott Rosenthal. Adored great-grandmother to Neil, Eric, Danny, Lauren, Andrea, Meredith, Harry and Devin. Caring sister-in-law to Isador, Rose and Claire Goldberg. A woman of valor, who can find? Her price is far above rubies. Many daughters have done worthily, but thou excellest them all. Rest in peace.
