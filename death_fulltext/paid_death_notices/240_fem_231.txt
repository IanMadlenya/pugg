        STARFIELD--Mimi, on January 5, 2008. A native New Yorker, she loved politics, books, and opera. Beloved mother of David and Lawrence, loving grandmother of Bonnie, Andy, Kim, and Daniele, dearest sister of Bobby, and darling daughter of the late Ruth and Irving. She had an independent spirit, strong principles, and a great sense of humor. She will be missed by all who knew her. In lieu of flowers, the family kindly requests donations to the charity of your choice.
