        TUROBINER-Alice. For the past 30 years our families have shared the Simchas and good times as well as the difficult ones. We would be remiss if we didn't send this final farewell to an elegant, regal woman whose Mitzvot and charity and philanthropic deeds were done in a quiet, yet legendary way. Your honesty, style and grace, both in your personal and professional life, as well as your wonderful friendship, will be sorely missed and will remain as part of your legacy to your family and friends. May your family truly take solace and comfort from your remarkable accomplishments and beauty and warmth during the years you shared with us as well as from the visionary words of the Prophet Micah, when longing for the Messianic Era, ''May G-d perish and banish death from this world forever and may He wipe away the tears from all of our faces.'' The Merlis Family
        TUROBINER-Alice. The last day spent together with you was very precious and will always be treasured. Shalom, dear friend. Deepest condolences to Harold, Ann and Carol. Molly and Isi
