        ROSENTHAL-Hilda. The Officers, Board of Directors and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Hilda Rosenthal, a cherished friend of the Jewish community.

We extend our sincerest sympathies to her daughter and son-in-law, Julie and Michael Sanjenis; her son and daughter-inlaw, Stephen and Roberta; her son and daughter-in-law, Eric and Sue; her grandchildren; and the entire family.
