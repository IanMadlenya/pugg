        FISHMAN-Priscilla. The Gimprich Family Foundation records with profound sorrow the untimely death of Priscilla Fishman in Jerusalem. Priscilla's contribution to the State of Israel and Jewish life were of inestimable value. She touched hundreds of lives and will be remembered for her keen intellect, openess of mind and warmth. Just as we have been enriched by having known her, we are diminished by her passing. We share the sorrow of her beloved family. Her memory will be a blessing because she was a blessing.
