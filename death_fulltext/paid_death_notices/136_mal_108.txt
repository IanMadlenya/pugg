        REED-Lionel C., 83. Resident of New City for 37 years, April 30, 1998. Having graduated as a chemical engineer from Worcester Polytechnic Institute with honors in 1936 he worked for the FDA, and then entered private industry, where he developed radio-labeled biochemicals used by major research centers to trace previously unknown pathways of human metabolism. His scholarly pursuits included music, arts, literature, and higher mathematics. His completed solution to the ''four color problem'' was presented to Princeton University. During the war he worked on classified projects. He was a loving husband, a concerned and charitable father, and a man of peculiar charm and wit, who charted courses energized by a strong sense of self-reliance. He was a keen observer of human nature and forgiving of human foibles. A home spun philosopher and master of the cleverly turned phrase, he will be greatly missed by family and friends. He was the loving father of Harold Reed, M.D., Lawrence (Arlene) Reed, M.D., Irving Reed, and Barry (Jill) Reed, M.D., dear brother of Lilly Rovno, Ida Gordon and cherished grandfather of Michael, Staci, Joshua, Dalia and Ilana.
