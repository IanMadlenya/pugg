        WEINTRAUB-Helene B. In loving memory of Helene B. Weintraub, a true pioneer of the 20th Century and champion of humanitarian causes, who lived her 91 years to the fullest extent of her intelligence and talents. Beloved mother of Bill & the late Michael, beloved sister of Shirley Barnett, loving grandmother of Jeremy, Sarah and Carissa, aunt to many caring nephews and a niece, dear sister-in-law of Ruth Schlesinger, will remain an inspiration and be greatly missed.
