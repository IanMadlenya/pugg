        IRISH--Mary Rettig. Of Plano, Texas and Manhattan died Sunday at age 59 in her Texas home after a long battle with cancer. She was a devoted wife whose passion for motherhood paralleled a life devoted to friendship and philanthropy. Mary was born of German parents in Nachod, Czechoslovakia, (now the Czech Republic) in the waning days of World War II. She and her parents, Mathias Rettig and Anna Illi Rettig, later immigrated to the United States and made their residence in Fremont, Ohio. Mary and George B. Irish were married in 1966 and began a life together in the newspaper industry. She lived in eight cities as an adult and developed a wide circle of friends in each one. Mary was active in charity work and was a frequent volunteer at the Call Again Thrift Shop in New York City. She was a member of The Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulcher of Jerusalem, the Gadabouts in New York and many garden clubs. In addition to her husband, Mary is survived by their two daughters, Sandra Lynn Irish and Christine Marie Irish Sheedy, both of Dallas; a third daughter, Diane Leslie Irish, preceded Mrs. Irish in death as an infant. Other survivors include son-inlaw, Malcolm Sheedy; two grandchildren, Carson Matthew Irish and Samuel Joseph Sheedy; and two brothers, Mathias Rettig, of Kent, Ohio, and John Rettig, of Fremont. The family will receive friends Wednesday, 4 to 8 P.M., at Keller-Ochs Funeral home, 416 Arch Street in Fremont. Mass is Thursday, 10:30 A.M. at St Joseph Catholic Church, 709 Croghan St. in Fremont. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that memorial contributions be made to St. Joseph's Central Catholic High School, 702 Croghan Street, Fremont, Ohio 43420, for the Mary Irish Center for Language Arts and Journalism.
