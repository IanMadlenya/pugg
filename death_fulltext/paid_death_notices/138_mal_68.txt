        LEVIN-William. The owners and employees of The Leon Levin Company express our sadness in the passage of our former President, and beloved mentor, William Levin, on July 6, 1998. An elegant gentleman of eternal youth, keen wit, and positive thinking, his innovative clothing designs for women set the early standards for the well dressed ''lady of golf''. His work ethic, classic style, and respect for quality are his legacy; his love of life, our inspiration. It was a privilege to have known him. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Wilma and his daughter Joyce. Neil and Virginia Weiss Barbara Connolly
