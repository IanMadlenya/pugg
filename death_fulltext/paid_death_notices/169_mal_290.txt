        LeROY-Warner. The entire Citymeals-on-Wheels family mourns the loss of our cherished friend and generous benefactor, Warner LeRoy. For twenty years Warner graciously hosted our events, always as a gift, always in surroundings only he could have created. He gave out of loving concern for frail elderly shut-ins throughout New York's five boroughs. We will miss him terribly and send condolences to all who loved him. Gael Greene, Chairman Preston Robert Tisch, President Marcia Stein, Executive Director Citymeals-on-Wheels
