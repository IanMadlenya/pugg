        ABRAMSON-Esther. This grand lady has been taken from our midst. No longer shall we experience her warmth, love and sensitivity. She will never be forgotten and is mourned by her grandchildren Marjorie Greene, Stuart Abramson, Jane Morris, Rebecca Dobler, Michael Kaplan and Deborah Dickensen, great-grandchildren, relatives and friends. She joins her husband Sidney once more in peace. It is with sorrow that we are reminded of the all too early taking of their children Max and Miriam. Once again, the family is joined in unity and with God. Hirsch and Linda F. Vogel Kaplan and families
