        ROSEN--Selma Modell. On December 9, 2005. Beloved wife of the late Charles H. Rosen. Devoted mother to Jane and Richard. Adoring grandmother to Dana, Brette, and Kitty. Loving sister of Arthur B. Modell, Pat Breslin Modell, the late Pansy Modell Bloom, and Bernard Bloom. Loving aunt to all her nieces and nephews. A true woman of valor. Goodness, kindness, generosity and forgiveness prevailed throughout her life. A tireless and selfless leader of the Kitty Modell League of the Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center, Charles H. Rosen Scholarship Fund of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and Hadassah. Committed to Jewish tradition and Israel, she created a home of warmth and dignity. A brilliant sculptor and pianist, she imparted her love of culture and beauty to all she met. The material world was not important to her. Friends, family, charity, and graciousness defined her life. The light of our lives has dimmed, but we carry the torch of her essence forever, in the hope to once again light the world with joy and goodness. Jane and Richard
