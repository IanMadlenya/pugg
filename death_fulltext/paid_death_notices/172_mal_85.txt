        KAZIS-Rabbi Israel J. We record with profound sadness the passing of our beloved colleague, age 90. After serving as a chaplain in the US Army during World War II, he assumed the pulpit of Congregation Mishkan Tefila in Boston until he became rabbi emeritus in 1976. During his tenure, Rabbi Kazis was one of the founders of the Solomon Schechter Day School in Newton, one of the premiere Jewish day schools in North America. We express our deepest condolences to his wife, Bernice and children Amy Avgar, Toby Vogel and Richard, and to all who were touched through his rabbinate. Rabbi Vernon H. Kurtz, President Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Exec. V.P. The Rabbinical Assembly
