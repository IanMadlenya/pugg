        MEIER-June. The Isabel O'Neil Studio Workshop and Foundation for the Art of the Painted Finish have lost a most dear, cherished friend and supporter. June was a founding member of the Board of Trustees, disciple of Isabel, master teacher and advisor which made ''go ask June'' a mantra for all in search of tradition and correctness. Her influence and contributions are intertwined with the studio and guide artisans who follow but her bright light will be greatly missed.
