        KRESIN -- Mark ''Marky''. Died June 23. Survived by his son Marshal. They are burying you today. The sorrow of it. You were too good for us anyway. Most didn't know what a dark place you were in or for how long. Fortunately and hopefully we will never know that place. We know you are at peace now and not in any pain anymore, but at the ultimate cost. There should have been another way. G-d help us. Forgive us. Scott Cooper and the ''Gang'' >>AD#
