        MOROSINI--Helen Simpson, 71, of Walpole, NH, died February 10, 2005 from complications following surgery for ovarian cancer. Born September 9, 1933 in Boston, MA, the daughter of Mary (Donnelly) and William Simpson, Helen was a graduate of Boston University. Devoted wife and best pal to Charles J. Morosini, Jr., M.D. for 47 years, she and Chuck raised their family and lived for many years in Scarsdale, NY. A great lover of books and a voracious reader, she worked from home as a reviewer for Book - of - the - Month Club while providing a loving home for her family. She later became executive assistant to noted economist Elliot Janeway from 1978 to 1984 and then worked as editor and Sr. vice president at the New York City office of Lloyds of London Press. She and Chuck retired to Walpole in 2000 where she continued to work as a part-time copy editor and at the local library. In addition to her beloved husband, she is survived and deeply missed by her three daughters, Dr. Deborah Morosini-Huschle of Weston, MA, Dana Reeve (widow of Christopher Reeve) of Bedford, NY, and Adrienne Heilman of Harwich, MA, and one brother, William Simpson of Dennis, MA. She also leaves--in body but never in spirit--five cherished grandchildren: James, Peter, Will, Erik and Logan who will always adore and remember their loving and funny ''Nonni.'' A memorial service to celebrate Helen's life will be held at 2:30 PM on Saturday, March 5, at Alyson's Orchard, Walpole, NH.
