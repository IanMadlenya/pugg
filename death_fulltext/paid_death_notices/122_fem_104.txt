With profound sorrow, we announce that Helen Sue Bookbinder, nee Landsman, passed away peacefully at her home in New York City, on March 10, following a brief but intense battle with cancer. Beloved wife of George, adored mother of Jay and David, and grandmother of Jeremy and Eliana, she will be deeply missed. Interment took place at the Worcester Cemetery in Danbury, Connecticut. In lieu of flowers, we would be grateful for contributions to the American Lung Association.
