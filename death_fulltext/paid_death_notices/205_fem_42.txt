        LASH--Trude. The Board of Directors and Staff of Citizens' Committee for Children of NY (CCC) mourn the passing of Trude W. Lash and extend our condolences to her family, friends and the colleagues who share our deep respect for and awe of her lifelong commitment to New York's children and families. Ms. Lash came to CCC in 1946 at the behest of Eleanor Roosevelt and served as Executive Director from 1952-1972. Ms Lash was honored to be an advocate in a time when advocacy was often frowned upon. Her leadership of CCC brought citywide reforms in day care, juvenile detention, and foster care, all of which were underscored by Ms. Lash's primary and deep-rooted belief in the power of volunteers. She will be greatly missed. Nancy Locker, Chairman Heidi Stamas, President Gail B. Nayowith, Exec Dir
