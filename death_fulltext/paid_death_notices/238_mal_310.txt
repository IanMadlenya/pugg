        SISKIND--Philip, dearest beloved husband of Phyllis, died Friday, November 24, 2006 in Madison, Wisconsin after a long battle with lymphoma. He was born in NYC in 1923 to parents Edward and Minnie; grew up with sister Judith in New Rochelle; attended Union College and then Columbia University; and served in the Army as an officer in the Philippines toward the end of World War II. He and Phyllis met in 1948, fell in love, and were married three months later. They had three children, four grandchildren and a long, luminous marriage. Philip was an innovative electrical engineer and natural leader who applied his talents developing navigation systems for Sperry Gyroscope in Great Neck, New York and ultimately Clearwater, FL, where he retired in 1986. He and Phyllis moved to Madison in 1995, where their older grandchildren were born. We remember Philip as patient, generous, and never judging; a soothing solver of problems applying his analytical skills, humor and scrupulous fairness to all manner of projects, overseeing the purchase and renovation of a theatre for the Young Shakespeare Players, coaching home repairs, running his Florida condominium association, advising his children in business, building furniture, designing dresses, telling stories, singing old songs. He was a most wonderful and loving husband and father, the quiet center of a noisy family. Philip is survived by his wife Phyllis, the love of his life, his children David, Sarah, and Joseph, grandchildren Helen, Sophia, Benjamin, and Carrie, and his sister Judith. He was a beautiful man.
