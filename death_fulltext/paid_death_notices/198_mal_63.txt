        HEISKELL -- Andrew. The Board, Staff and Artists of Lincoln Center Theater grieve the death of the beloved Vice Chairman of the theater since its re-establishment in 1985, our treasured Andrew Heiskell. The theater was greatly blessed by Andrew's extraordinary spirit, his profound understanding of the way cultural institutions work in New York City. Andrew reveled in the artistic life of the theater. He was endlessly curious about the plays, their provenance and was eager to understand the process by which a script was converted to a production. He was given to saying that having read a play, he couldn't quite imagine it on stage, and was most often delighted by the realization of a production. Andrew's commitment, generosity, kindness and challenging intellect will be sorely missed along with his wise and gently commanding presence. We extend deeply felt condolences to Marian and all the family. John Beinecke, Chairman Linda L. Janklow, Chairman Emeritus John Chalsty, President Andre Bishop, Artistic Director Bernard Gersten, Executive Producer
