        LETZT-Max, 87. Beloved husband of the late Ethel Letzt. Died on Sept 14, peacefully in his sleep surrounded by his caring family. Devoted father of Danny and Jeffrey and specially devoted to his daughter-in-law Lois. Cherished brother to Harry and Rose. Loving uncle to all his nieces and nephews especially to Judy who was more like a loving, caring daughter than a niece. Very much loved grandfather of Justin and Jared. Also a great-grandfather. A special thanks Dr. Brandon and Dr. Zaremsky for taking such wonderful care of Max for all these years. He will be fondly remembered for his generousity and exploits, by his very dear friends, Frank & Nancy, Kevin and Bill, Marina and Claudia who all cared very much for him. Our adventures in Atlantic City will never be forgotten. We will forever miss your wit, wisdom, humor, support and care. We will always love & remember you. Thank you Max for everything and all the memories that will never be forgotten. There will be a small private ceremony and interment at Old Montefiore Cemetery on Sept. 16 at 1PM at the gravesite.
