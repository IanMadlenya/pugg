        BURNHILL - Michael, MD. Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) staff and volunteers deeply mourn the loss of Michael Burnhill, MD, a lifelong champion of reproductive rights and women's health in this country and internationally. An obstetrician/gynecologist and pioneer in contraceptive technology, Dr. Burnhill was a PPFA vice-president for medical affairs for the past five years, while continuing his private practice. He first joined Planned Parenthood in 1972 as medical director of Planned Parenthood of New York City when it began to offer abortion services. He was a noted author, researcher and educator who took great pride in training physicians and nurse practitioners as a means to expand access to reproductive health care. We will miss his wisdom, warmth and passion, and will remember his relentless courage on behalf of women all over the world. We extend to his family and friends our heartfelt sympathy as well as our best wishes for happy and proud memories. The family has requested that contributions in his name be sent to PPFA (810 Seventh Ave, New York, New York 10019), which will establish a special fund in Dr. Burnhill's honor. Mary Shallenberger, Chair Gloria Feldt, President Planned Parenthood Federation of America
