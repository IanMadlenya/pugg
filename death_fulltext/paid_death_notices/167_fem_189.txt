        HERMANN-Patricia A. New York City School Teacher and Asst Principal for 22 years. Died of lung cancer on December 18, 2000, four days after her 57th birthday in Vieques, Puerto Rico, where she lived for the past seven years. Wife of Lou Yager, Sister of Susan Hermann Ginsberg and Donald Ginsberg; Aunt of Cristopher and Nicholas Goodman, Daughter of the late Sylvia and Dr. Nathaniel R. Hermann. She was a unique and brilliant character whose love of teaching was only surpassed by her love of Puerto Rico and its culture. Born in Brooklyn, N.Y., she graduated from the Berkeley Institute, attended Cornell University and graduated cum laude from New York University, where she also attained a Master's degree in English. Her diminutive size did not impede her boundless energy and commitment to working with at risk youths. ''Ms Hermann'' worked at FDR High School in Brooklyn as an English teacher, Asst Principal and Dean of Students. After retiring from teaching in 1987, she pursued a career in fashion as a manufacturer and retailer of Balinese-inspired clothing. She could be seen with her flaming red hair at the street fairs on Columbus Ave and the Jacob Javits Center. Her Bali Llama stores on the Island of Vieques were the first of their kind. Everyone who knew Patricia will remember her for her creative visions, strong individuality and mostly for the love of the people she lived with. She was truly a Puerto Rican at heart, and up until her last days, fought tirelessly for Paz Para Vieques. Descanse En Paz. A celebration of her life will take place at a later date.
