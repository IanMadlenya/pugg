        MAAS-Michael. The partners and staff of HLW mourn the untimely passing of Mr. Michael Maas. His 40 years with HLW, particularly those spent as Senior Managing Partner, were significant in enriching both the firm and its people through his leadership and dedication to the architectural profession. Mr. Maas established and oversaw the operations of both the marketing and public relations activities of the firm and was instrumental in helping it maintain the prominent position it has held for over 115 years in both the profession and the City of New York. In addition, he created, developed and nurtured the Interior Design activities of HLW, helping it to achieve singular success as one of the ten largest Interior Design firms in the country. Throughout his distinguished career, Mr. Maas was instrumental in such projects as the world headquarters for Chemical Bank, corporate headquarters for the US Trust Company, and buildings for Prudential, The Bank of New York, Travelers, Jaguar, the US Army War College and the School of Public Health at Harvard University. Mr. Maas was a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects, served on its national Board of Directors and helped craft the first AIA national advertising campaign. Our deepest condolences to his family; he will be missed.
