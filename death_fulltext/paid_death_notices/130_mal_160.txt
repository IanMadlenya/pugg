        FLAHERTY-Robert. The Board and staff of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society mourn the loss of their Honorary Life Director. A loyal and devoted colleague of the Society, ''Bud'' Flaherty had been an active member of the National Board since 1980 until his retirement last year. His commitment to the Society included serving on the Executive, Chapter Relations, Fund Raising and Nominating and National Services Committees. He also served as Regional Vice Chairman and was a past Vice President and Trustee of the Southern California Chapter. We remain grateful for his tireless work to ''end the devastating effects of multiple sclerosis'' and for his friendship. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his wife, Nancy and his three children. Richard L. Snyder, Chairman General Michael J. Dugan (Ret), President and CEO
