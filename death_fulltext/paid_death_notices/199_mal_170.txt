        SOHMER--Abram, MD. A much-admired and beloved family doctor for more than fifty years, Abram Sohmer died in his sleep on August 6th after a long illness patiently suffered. His wife was at his side. Abram Sohmer earned his M.D. in 1939 at Emory University, Atlanta, and served as a Lieutenant Colonel flight surgeon with the Ninth Air Force in Egypt, England, and France during the Second World War. He was decorated with the Bronze Star Medal and served on General Eisenhower's staff during the Battle of Bulge. After the war, he entered private medical practice in Jamaica, New York. His brilliance as a diagnostician, his kind and caring manner, his optimism and gentle humor brought him a large practice, more than ten thousand persons. He loved being a family doctor and spurned offers to specialize. He routinely treated more than sixty patients a day. He began his hospital rounds at 6AM, held office hours from 10AM to 9PM, and rarely completed his house calls before midnight. He delivered more than two thousand babies. He saved many lives. He was old school. He was loved, honored and cherished by the community to which he devoted his life. A humble man, he turned from praise. Abram is survived by his wife of sixty-three years, Millie; two sons, Steve and Paul; a brother, Hy Sohmer; a sister, Martha Zuckerman; and seven grandchildren.
