        ECCLES--Mary Hyde. The American Trust for the British Library extends its deep sympathy to the family of Lady Eccles who, with her late husband Viscount David Eccles, was long intimately involved with the Library. She was a most generous supporter of it and of the American Trust. The David and Mary Eccles Centre for American Studies at the Library is a living testament to Mary's and David's devotion to bibliophilic scholarship as well as the Anglo-American tie. The Trustees of the ATBL will greatly miss her lively spirit, her graciousness and wise advice.
