        SCIARRA-Daniel, M.D. The faculty, staff, and students of Columbia University Health Sciences and the NewYorkPresbyterian Hospital mourn the loss of an esteemed colleague, mentor, and friend, Dr. Daniel Sciarra. An invaluable member of the Columbia Presbyterian community since 1948, Dr. Sciarra most recently served as professor of clinical neurology and as a neurologist at the New York Neurological Institute at NewYork-Presbyterian. In addition to giving five decades of service to Columbia Presbyterian as a teacher and clinician, Dr. Sciarra also founded the Neurological Institutes first fully funded clinical chair-the Sciarra Professorship in Clinical Neurology-in 1987, perpetuating his legacy of excellence in education and patient care. He was a graduate of Harvard University and Harvard Medical School. He is survived by his wife Lilo, children Dalen Cole, Lorraine, J. Daniel, Gina Louise and Michael Sciarra, and Chetra Kotzas, and six grandchildren, to whom we extend our most heartfelt sympathies. He will be deeply missed.
