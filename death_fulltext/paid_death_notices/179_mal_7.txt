        ZWICK-Avraham, 81. Our Dolfi, beloved brother, brother-in-law, uncle and great-uncle, died on November 28, 2001, at his home in Tivon, Israel. Dolfi was a good man, a loving and generous person, who served his country as a major in the IDF during the War of Independence, and as General Manager of the Israel Railroad. He will always be in our hearts. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Yudit, and their sons, Hanan, Rami and Uri. The Pickers
