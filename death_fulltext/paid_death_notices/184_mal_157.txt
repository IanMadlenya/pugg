        LOHF-Kenneth A. The Trustees and staff of the Morgan Library note with sadness the death of Kenneth A. Lohf, a Fellow since 1980. His distinguished career in the rare book world made him a valued member of the Council of Fellows. He was an erudite, discerning, creative collector. His unsurpassed collection of poetry of the two world wars is a permanent memorial to his lifelong commitment to the literary arts. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his family and friends.
