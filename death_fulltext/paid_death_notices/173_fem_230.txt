        TANNER-Dorelle. The Officers and Directors of The Garden Club of America express deep sorrow on the death of their former President, Mrs. Frederick C. Tanner, and extend deepest sympathy to her family and friends. Dorelle Tanner served The Garden Club with great distinction and extraordinary ability as its 19th President (1971-1973) and in many other capacities. Beginning in 1953, she served as Treasurer and Vice President for two terms. She also served as Chairman of The Endowment Fund Drive, and Chairman of The Finance and Nominating Committees. A member of The Greenwich Connecticut Garden Club, Mrs. Tanner was a talented and gentle person, who loved life. The successive offices she held in The Garden Club of America speak eloquently of her many accomplishments.
