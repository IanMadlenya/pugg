        SIMONSON-Dr. Hana. Witty, brilliant, caring, courageous, honest, devoted, loving wife, sister, mother and grandmother. She endeared herself to whomever she met, wherever, whenever. A straight talker, she told it as it was-no pretense, no nonsense. Her rare & remarkable courage & strength in the face of challenges most of us could never handle will stand as an inspiration for all humankind. Hana, Ma, Bobbie will be missed terribly. May we honor her by carrying memories she had forward always. Hana is survived by her sister, Rachel, her children, Shia, Rayze and Alex, and by her grandchildren, Rebecca, Raphael, Noa, Solomon, Zosh, Yair and Yonah.
