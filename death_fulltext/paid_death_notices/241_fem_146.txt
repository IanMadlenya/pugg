        SCHERR--Ruth Watnick, 93, died February 16, 2007. A woman of keen intelligence and intellectual curiosity, she possessed boundless enthusiasm. She cared passionately about her family and her Jewish heritage. A dynamic educator and leader in many Jewish organizations, including the Hebrew Educational Society and the Laurelton Jewish Center, she had a devoted following in the Bible course she taught for over 25 years. Born into a poor immigrant family, she succeeded in graduating from Columbia Teachers College and the Jewish Theological Seminary. She was married for 68 years to Herman Scherr, who predeceased her. Surviving are four children: Judith Siegel, Joanna Livne, David Scherr, and Eloise Raymond; seven grandchildren, and several great-grandchildren, to treasure her memory. The funeral will be held Sunday, 2:00 pm at Riverside-Nassau North in Great Neck. Shiva will be at the home of David Scherr, 34 North Drive, Great Neck.
