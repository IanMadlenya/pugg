        STEINBERG-Sylvia. Of Tamarac, Florida, passed away on Thursday, September 23, 1999. She leaves her husband of sixty-two years, Dr. Philip M. Steinberg, sons Dr. Alfred D. Steinberg and Richard M. Steinberg, grandchildren Dr. Bonnie Jean SteinbergJennis, Robert T. Steinberg, Dr. Ellen Beth Steinberg, Kathleen Triem, David A. Steinberg, Jonathan E. Steinberg, and Charles A. Frentz, and great-grandchildren Noah Jennis and Aaron Jennis. Sylvia Steinberg, the daughter of Benjamin Govern and Ada Rothrug Govern, was born in Brooklyn, New York and lived for many years in New York City and Great Neck, NY. She earned a Master's Degree in Geology at Columbia University. An expert on snow cover in New York State, she became the first woman professional to work for the national weather bureau. She also has a rock collection at the Smithsonian Institution which has been on public display for many years and has been used for research. Mrs. Steinberg was an extremely intelligent and thoughtful individual who provided critical advice to several generations. She was active in many charities and an officer and board member of several, including City of Hope and ORT. She was president of the PTA in Jackson Heights. A modern woman for her generation, she juggled responsibilities to work, family, and friends so effectively that she never seemed rushed or put out. She was always there to help people bridge differences. Her method of consensus building preceded by more than a generation the modern use of that technique. All of those that she touched deeply will forever be in her debt. She will be sorely missed.
