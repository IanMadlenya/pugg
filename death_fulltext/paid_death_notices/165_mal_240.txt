        HUNT-William E., 77. October 14, 2000. Producer and Director. Bill founded the Red Barn & Tinker's Pond theaters on Long Island and co-designed Theater East in Manhattan. He directed well over 100 plays and reviews, many of which he adapted, off Broadway and in Stock from 1953-1999 including ''Green Julia'' with James Woods and ''Get Happy'', The Music of Harold Arlen. Bill was also a tireless volunteer especially in the battle against AIDS. He brought his own particular brand of comfort to clients of God's Love We Deliver, Goldwater Memorial Hospital, St. Lukes-Roosevelt Hospital Center, and to many others. He was a hero of the epidemic. Humanitarian and man of the theater, he will be missed. Kathleen Chalfant Beverly Chase
