        McANDREW-William J. It is with deepest sadness that we mourn the passing of Bill McAndrew on June 27, 2003. Bill was a devoted husband, father, grandfather and friend. He is survived by his wife Megan, his children Kathleen, Chris, Barbara, Patty and Simon, his six grandchildren and countless friends. Bill was one of the country's leading experts on payments, clearance and settlement systems in both developed and developing countries. Bill retired from Manufacturer's Hanover Trust Company in 1993 as the Senior Vice President in charge of Global Banking Systems. After leaving Manufacturer's Hanover, Bill became the Senior Advisor on Payments, Clearance and Settlement at the Financial Services Volunteer Corps (FSVC) and over the past 10 years provided technical assistance to central banks, commercial banks and capital markets institutions in Central and Eastern Europe, Russia and the other republics of the former Soviet Union, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. He will be greatly missed. A Memorial Service will be held at the University Club, One West 54 Street, on Friday, July 11th at 11 AM.
