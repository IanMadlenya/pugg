        MAYNARD -- Ruth Corson. Passed away peacefully at her home in Boca Grande, FL. on March 13 at the age of 60 after a valiant year-long battle with cancer. Beloved sole sister of Meg Gilsten Hale. Loving aunt of Rachel Hale and Lucas (and Michelle) Hale. Daughter of the late Ann and Sydney Wildman. Graduate of Skidmore College. At the time of her death she was a Managing Consultant with Fitch Ratings in the public finance group. Her career as a municipal bond analyst spanned over 38 years. Ruth was fiercely independent and did things her way, as anyone who knew her would agree. She defied convention when it came to medical advice and drove alone in her beloved Mercedes from Florida to New York and back this summer as well as from Florida to Dallas for Thanksgiving. She was an inspiration to all who knew her. For information regarding a memorial service please contact Ruth Navedo at 212-908-0500 ext 422.
