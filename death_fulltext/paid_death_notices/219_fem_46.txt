        FAIN--Janel S. Passed away on April 7, 2005, after a yearlong battle with lung cancer. Ms. Fain is survived by her husband, Joseph H. Spiegel, numerous nieces, nephews and the many people, both young and old, that she mentored, loved and supported, including thirteen foreign exchange students (some of whom never went home) and little sisters from the Big Brothers/Big Sisters Program. Ms. Fain, an attorney, was active at Jewish Federation and was a very strong supporter of the State of Israel. Her greatest passion was for the U of M Mott Children's Hospital Giving Library where she was the first person to volunteer in this program, reading to sick children from books the young patients could keep. It was her wish that memorial donations, in lieu of flowers, be made in her name to the University of Michigan Children's Hospital Giving Library, Attn: Sarah Mellifont, C.S. Mott Children's Hospital, 1500 E. Medical Center Dr., F2519, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-0253. A memorial service will be held on April 17, 2005 at 10:00 A.m. at Palmer Commons, 100 Washtenaw Ave., Ann Arbor, Michigan.
