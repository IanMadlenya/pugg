        LEVINE--Carl S. 59, devoted husband of 29 years to Louise Levine, dedicated father of Evan, Joshua and Amanda, passed away peacefully on September 13, 2006 after a two year battle with ALS. In addition to practicing law for 33 years, he also served on the Boards of Directors of Envirosure Mgt Corp and Teltronics, Inc and several private companies. He was active as an affiliate member of the Empire State Petroleum Assoc for 30 years and served as an Associate Judge in the Village of Old Westbury, NY. Carl was best known, however, for his unconditional loyalty to friends and family as well as his wonderfully witty sense of humor. He had an irrepressible willingness to risk his own welfare for the benefit and trust of those whom he loved, a selflessness that was best reflected by the scores of visitors who came from across the globe to see him in his final days.
