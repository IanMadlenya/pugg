        JAHNIGEN-Dennis W., M.D. The Board, staff and members of the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) note with great sadness the passing of our colleague, friend, and Immediate Past President, Dr. Dennis W. Jahnigen. A warm, compassionate and talented physician, Dr. Jahnigen was deeply commited to geriatrics practice, research and education. The Goodstein Professor of Geriatric Medicine and Director of the Center on Aging at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, he was long recognized as an extraordinary teacher, with a number of awards from students and faculty. He is the author, co-author or editor of 68 books, book chapters and articles on a wide variety of geriatrics topics. Under his leadership, the AGS developed numerous national programs to enhance geriatrics education and attract trainees to the field. The AGS recently named him winner of the 1998 Milo D. Leavitt Award, which is given annually to an eminent individual with a distinguished, nationally recognized career in geriatrics eduation. Dr. Jahnigen's clinical skills and heartfelt concern for older adults continue to flourish in the many students who have benefited from his teaching and mentorship. His personal warmth, wise counsel and national leadership will be sorely missed by his students and colleagues, as well as his patients and their families. The AGS extends its deepest sympathy to his family.
