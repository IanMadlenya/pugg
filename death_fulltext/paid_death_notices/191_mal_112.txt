        ARLEDGE - Roone. The President and Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York express deep sorrow at the passing of Roone Arledge, a member of the Columbia College class of 1952. His leadership as a University Trustee was marked by exceptional insight, unfailing decency, and a passionate dedication to his alma mater. Roone Arledge Auditorium and Cinema, located within Columbia's student center, was made possible by his generosity. Columbia University extends its profound sympathy to his wife, Mrs. Gigi Arledge, his daughters Elizabeth, Susan, and Patricia, his son Roone, his stepdaughter Catherine Shaw, and his grandchildren.
