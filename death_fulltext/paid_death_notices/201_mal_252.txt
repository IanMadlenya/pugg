        HAHN--Jerome S., age 73 on October 25, 2003, founder and President of Regent Sheffield Ltd, New York and Chairman of Richardson Sheffield, England and Taiwan, manufactured and distributed cutlery and flatware around the world. Jerry's vision and innovative approach transformed an archaic manufacturing process into a modern computer and robotic assisted industry. During a Royal visit to Richardson Sheffield, his development of the 'Laser' knife was recognized by the prestigious ''Queen's Award''. When Jerry and his wife Lynn moved to Boca Raton, Florida, he became committed to an observant life and Torah studies. As a Member of the Boca Raton Synagogue he was deeply involved in financial matters. His generosity enabled the Synagogue to establish the The Hahn Judaic Campus, now the site of the Boca Raton Synagogue, The Community Kollel, The Community Mikvah, The Weinbaum Yeshiva High School and The Senders Library. He was committed to Aish Hatorah Yeshiva in Israel, where the Hahns had a residence in the Old City of Jerusalem. Jerry created and edited ''BIBLE BASICS'', a user friendly guide to the Five Books of Moses. His other interests included archaeology, creative writing, and computer technology. He is survived by his devoted wife Lynn, sister June and family, 3 sons Jonathan (Rachayel) Ari (Esther) and Steven (Avital), 16 grandchildren and 12 great grandchildren. May the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem comfort the Hahn family.
