        FELD-Eva. The Trustees and staff of The Jewish Museum note with great sadness the passing of our longtime patron, whose magnificent generosity provided for the establishment of the Museum's Morris and Eva Feld Chair of Judaica and purchase funds for the Museum's collection. Eva Feld's enthusiasm for Jewish culture will be remembered fondly. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to her family. E. Robert Goodkind, Chairman Robert J. Hurst, President Joan Rosenbaum, Director
