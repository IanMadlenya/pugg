        LOWRY -- Bates. The Trustees and Staff of The Museum of Modern Art join the art world in mourning the loss of Dr. Bates Lowry. As the third Director of MoMA from 1968 to 1969, he was an integral part of MoMA's history, and we extend our deepest sympathy to his two daughters, Patricia Lowry, and Anne Klonsky. David Rockefeller, Chairman Emeritus Agnes Gund, President Emerita Ronald S. Lauder, Chairman Robert B. Menschel, President Glenn D. Lowry, Director The Museum of Modern Art, NY
