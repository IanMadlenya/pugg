        FORMAN-William. The Brooklyn College community mourns the passing of Professor Emeritus of Mathematics William Forman, Class of 1936. His 60 years of teaching, interrupted only by military service during World War II, and his professional contributions, which continued from his formal retirement in 1985 to the present, will be long remembered and deeply appreciated. Vernon E. Lattin, President Brooklyn College
