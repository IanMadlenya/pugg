        LEWIS-John. The House of Steinway & Sons is profoundly saddened by the passing of its beloved friend and devoted Steinway Artist John Lewis, on March 29 at the age of 80. As pianist, composer, arranger, and as the musical director of the famed Modern Jazz Quartet, Mr. Lewis was an artist of exceptional creativity and taste. The public was blessed by his long and illustrious career, and his affiliation with our firm for more than four decades is treasured. His music and his acclaimed discography will keep his legacy alive for future generations. All who knew John Lewis will cherish his grace and humility, rare personal qualities in so distinguished an artist. To his wife, Mirjana, his children and his family we extend our heartfelt condolences. His loss is deeply felt. Bruce A. Stevens, President Peter B. Goodrich, V.P., Worldwide Concert & Artist Activities
