        WEISFOGEL--Jaret Wayne, Ph.D., 38, died on April 25, 2005. Beloved son of Drs. Jerry & Matonah Weisfogel, older brother of Amiel, and brother-in-law of Rebecca. A distinguished scholar of East Asian studies, he received the prestigious Heyman Center Postdoctoral Fellowship in Confucian Studies at Columbia University. His first love in life was his family, to whom he was selflessly devoted. His thoughtfulness and kindness were as essential to his character as were his honesty, his integrity, and his intellectual curiosity. He surrounded himself with his beloved scholarly works and classical music. On walks with family and friends, he would always stop to appreciate the smallest details of life. To say that he will be sorely missed would understate the immense void he leaves behind in the lives of those who loved him. He fought a long and courageous battle against Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Service Wednesday, 11:45 AM, at ''The Riverside,'' 76th and Amsterdam Ave. Donations in Jaret's name can be made by planting a tree in Israel through the Jewish National Fund.
