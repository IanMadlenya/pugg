        PINKHAM-Mary S. (''Bunnie''). On March 8, 1999. Born in New York City December 28, 1916, the dear daughter of the late William W. and Mary G. Struthers. Adoring wife of Richard Alden Ray Pinkham, whom she married in 1941, who died in 1997. Loving and dedicated mother of Mary P. (''Penny'') Janeway of Cambridge, MA, Richard Jr. of Rye, NY, David of Barrington, RI and Elizabeth P. (''Betty'') Anderson of Billings, MT. Delighted grandmother of Sam, Daisy, Laurie, Rick, Mary, Rosie, Jamie and Tim. Sister of Nina S. Bremer, Sara S. Frothingham and the late William W. Struthers, Jr. She lived in Rye, NY until 1981 when she and her husband moved to Hobe Sound, FL and Greenwich, CT. She was a student, teacher, parent, grandparent and President of the Board of Trustees of her dear alma mater, Rye Country Day School. When the School expanded to become co-ed through 12th grade, The Mary Struthers Pinkham Building was named in her honor. She served on the Board of Managers of the United Hospital, where her four children were born, and where she died. She also served on the Advisory Board of the Foundation for Children with Learning Disabilities. An athlete all her life, she was an All-American in lacrosse and field hockey, a notable tennis player, and a golfer in her later years. Her dearest friendships lasted a lifetime, and she was widely admired and loved for her loyalty, sense of duty, selflessness, uprightness and old-fashioned grace. She has gone from the double darkness of Alzheimer's and bereavement into the Light. We grieve and we rejoice. Family visitation at William H. Graham Funeral Home, 1036 Boston Post Road in Rye on Wednesday, March 10 from 6:00 to 8:00 pm. Memorial service at 11:00 am, Thursday, March 11 at Christ Church, Milton Road, Rye.
