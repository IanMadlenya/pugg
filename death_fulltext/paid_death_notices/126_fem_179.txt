        MINSKY-Gertrude. Gertrude Minsky passed away peacefully July 21, 1997. She was the beloved wife of the late Dr. Arthur Minsky; the most wonderful mother to Joan Minsky and Ann and Mark Levitt; a kind, wise and nurturing grandmother to Emily Jacobs, Stefanie Jacobs, Jennifer Levitt and Jason Levitt. Gertrude was a friend to everyone she knew radiating love and graciousness. She gave new meaning to the term generous, in every sense of the word. Her everlasting optimism and calm manner will live on in all who knew her. She will be deeply missed by everyone who had the privilege of sharing life with her. Service on Thursday noon at Schwartz Brothers, 114-03 Queens Boulevard, Forest Hills. Should friends desire, contributions may be made to UJA.
