        ROOT-Clifford D. Thelen Reid & Priest LLP mourns the loss of a friend and colleague. Cliff was a leader of the public utility bar. He served as managing partner of the former Reid & Priest for nine years. Cliff was known for his negotiating skills, sense of humor, incisive intellect and photographic memory, which were brought to bear in his representation of clients and his management of Reid & Priest. His partners remember him for his strength of character, fair mindedness, courage and compassion. Cliff was a true and loyal friend and professional. We extend our most sincere sympathy to his wife, Maxine Winifred Carlisle, and family members.
