        KAHN--Bernard. The entire Beth Israel Medical Center family acknowledges with sadness the passing of our dear friend and beloved benefactor, Bernard Kahn. Bernie generously supported many programs and services during his association with Beth Israel, often in memory of his late wife and daughter. The Barbara Weisman Fund, which he established in memory of his daughter, provides assistance to the patients at Beth Israel dealing with cancer and other serious illnesses. He also was particularly interested in providing philanthropic support for the benefit of individuals with limited financial resources and access to care. To Anna Marie Deyneka, his companion of many years, his grandsons Daniel & Jonathan Weisman, his family, and all who loved him, we extend heartfelt condolences. Morton P. Hyman Chairman, Board of Trustees Thomas Killip, M.D. Interim President and CEO Martin M. Feuer, M.D. Former Associate Chairman Department of Medicine
