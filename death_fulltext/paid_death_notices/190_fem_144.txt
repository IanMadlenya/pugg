        BRAINARD-Katharine. The School for Strings, its faculty, staff, students, parents and Trustees deeply mourn the passing of Katharine Brainard. In her many capacities as the head of the Cello Department, Chamber Music Faculty, Teacher, Trainer and a mentor to her students and their families, Katharine's contribution to the school was immeasurable. She was a rare teacher, distinguished by extraordinary depth of knowledge and passion for teaching, and by genuine concern for her students' development and well-being. We reach out to Katharine's colleagues and students at Mannes College of Music, Hoff - Barthelson Music School and The Juilliard School, and to her family and friends, with our message of sympathy and regret. She will be dearly missed by all whose lives she has touched. Louise Behrend, Director and Founder Adele Hogan, Chairman of the Board Alexander Yudkovsky, Executive Director
