        WERBER-Francis J. April 24, 2000, aged 79. Deeply devoted husband of the late Anne Sullivan Werber; beloved brother of Florence, Isabel and the late Charles Werber; wonderful father to his sons, Frank, Robert, John and Andrew; loving grandfather to Nicholas, Elizabeth and William Werber. A man of integrity who will be fondly remembered for his humility, his kindness and his truly extraordinary generosity. We will miss his cantankerous but always ready humor, his legendary idiosyncrasies, and that great heart that was always worn right on his sleeve. Funeral Mass at St. Aloysius R.C. Church, Middle Neck Road, Great Neck, Friday, April 28, at 9:45 AM. Interment All Saints Churchyard, Great Neck. In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to Pathfinder Village for Downs Syndrome Children, Edmeston, New York 13335.
