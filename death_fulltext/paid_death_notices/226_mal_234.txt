He leaves his wife Rhona, sons Chas and Peter, daughter Lisa, grandchildren Emma and Alice, and brother Guy. A graduate of Harvard College and the University of Pennsylvania Medical School, his clinical work and extensive research were devoted to the study of cancer, first at Harvard, then at the University of Minnesota and later at Yale. His books include ''The Facts About Cancer'' and ''A Time to Die, the Place for Physician Assistance.'' An avid outsdoorsman, he enjoyed sailing, canoeing, skiing, climbing and hiking with his family. A memorial service will be held at Yale in the spring.
