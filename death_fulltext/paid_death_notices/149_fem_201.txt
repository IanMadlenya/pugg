        ALFANDRE-Julian E. June 21, 1940-September 8, 1997. Birthdays, two Father's Days of desperately missing you: your quiet eminence; your integrity of heroic proportions; your profound passion for the truth; your prodigious intellect. You-consummate, incomparable Dad. And, friend. Your namesake, Julianna, has arrived. You prevail in her gladness, in her opulent spirit, and heart stopping beauty. Rachel, Jimmy, David and Natalie
