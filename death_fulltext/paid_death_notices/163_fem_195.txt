        WENDER-Ruth. It is with great sorrow that the Board of Directors and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Ruth Wender, a generous supporter of our Women's Campaign. Our deepest sympathies go to her twin sister, Irene Winkelman, herself a devoted contributor; her son, Theodore, and his wife, Vicki; her daughter Jill, and her husband, Richard Spitz; and the entire family. May all who benefited from Ruth's kindness and wisdom be consoled among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. James S. Tisch, President Larry Zicklin, Board Chair John S. Ruskay, Exec VP & CEO
