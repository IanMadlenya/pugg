        BERNSTEIN -- Cal (Calvin Joseph). Cal Bernstein, loving husband of 53-years to Roz, caring father to Josh (and Yolanda Ramirez) and Jonine (and Randy Mastro), proud grandfather to Arianna Mastro, adoring brother to Claire Koslow, fond uncle to his nieces and nephews, and loyal friend to many, died in Los Angeles of pancreatic cancer on August 10. He would have been 78 years old on August 30. Cal was an award-winning photojournalist who chronicled the civil rights movement among other stories in the 50's and 60's, and later produced and directed television commercials at his company, Dove Films. He was passionate and appreciative about the best that life has to offer, from food (he wrote a restaurant guide) to Italian design to politics to his granddaughter's smile. His two dogs, Jazz and Evie, were show dogs, but he loved them as pets. In recent years, he offered and photographed stunning CD ROM guides to wine and race horses. He was a great artist, taking photographs and making beautiful prints until his last days. He was utterly devoted to his friends and family. With a mail order license, he performed moving wedding ceremonies, not for profit but for friendship. A generous being, overflowing with life and understanding. He was easy to love.
