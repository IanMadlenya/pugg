        HAMPTON-Mark. The Trustees, Fellows and Staff of the American Academy in Rome mourn the loss of our treasured Trustee and friend, Mark Hampton. As a dedicated preservationist, historian, and decorator, for 15 years he has been a driving force behind our building restoration efforts. He joyously and generously gave of his time and energy, his taste and expertise, and he inspired others to follow suit. He was literate, musical, encyclopedic, inventive and fun, the closest thing we had to a national standard. He will be forever missed. Michael I. Sovern, Chairman Adele Chatfield-Taylor, President
        HAMPTON-Mark. The New York School of Interior Design notes with sadness the passing of its esteemed Advisory Board member, Mark Hampton, whose intelligence and talent were an inspiration to all who had the pleasure of knowing him. He joins the ranks of the ''Legendary Decorators of the 20th Century'' about whom he so eloquently wrote. We offer our deepest sympathies to his family. Carl A. Schwarz, Jr., Chairman, Board of Trustees Inge Heckel, President
