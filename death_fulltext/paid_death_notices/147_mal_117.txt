        BENIN-Albert. The Board of Directors and staff of UJA-Federation of New York are deeply saddened by the death of Albert Benin, a devoted friend of the Jewish communities of New York, Israel and France. By creating scholarship funds for the support of scientific study, he enabled students here and in Israel to further their knowledge of the world around us. A true citizen of the world, he will be missed by all whose lives he touched. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair James S. Tisch, President Lynn Korda Kroll, Chair, PG&E Stephen D.
