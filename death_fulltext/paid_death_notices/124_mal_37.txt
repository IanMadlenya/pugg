        WINTER-Harold, died on April 22. Dearly beloved husband of Susan. Adored father of Peter, and Robin and David Bailey. Joyous and devoted ''poppa'' of Emily. We have lost ''our best friend''. He was a gentleman, who touched so many lives with his goodness and genuine concern. The warmth he radiated gave everyone immediate comfort. He gave so much in heart and deed, but never asked for anything in return. The kindness and quiet wisdom that he gave to all of us will live on like a legacy of love and will forever remain with us to cherish.
