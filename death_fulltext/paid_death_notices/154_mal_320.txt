        FITZGERALD-C. Winston. Age 77, on November 26, after a long illness. A native of Lynchburg, VA, Winston in the 50's was Alexander Greiner's assistant as Artist Liaison for Steinway & Sons. For S. Hurok, he served as manager for Marian Anderson's farewell tour and for Sviatoslav Richter's last U.S. tour. He joined the staff of the New York Philharmonic, where he remained until his retirement. Survived by his longtime friend, Hilton Bailey, Winston will be missed by many.
