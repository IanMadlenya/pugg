        ROSENBERG-Yaakov. The Jewish Theological Seminary family records with sorrow the passing of Yaakov Rosenberg, whose dedication to Judaism and love for Israel left a lasting impact on JTS and the Conservative movement. Rabbi Rosenberg served for eight years as vice chancellor for development at JTS, following a long career as a beloved congregational Rabbi in Philadelphia. A warm, gregarious man who was sensitive to others, Rabbi Rosenberg was loved by students, faculty and congregants alike. Predeceased by his first wife, Devorah, he will be deeply missed by his wife Bernice, children Shirah and Rabbi Shawn Zell of Clark, NJ and Pnina and Gary Wiener of Israel and eight grandchildren. May his memory be for a blessing. Ismar Schorsch, Chancellor Gershon Kekst, Chairman
        ROSENBERG-Rabbi Yaakov. We record with profound sadness the passing of our beloved colleague. He was Rabbi of Adath Jeshurun in Philadelphia where he became a national leader in the Conservative Movement. He influenced a generation of rabbis and we are grateful for his inspiration. In 1978, he became Vice-Chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary from which he retired as Emeritus in 1987 when he made aliyah to Israel. We express our deepest condolences to his children, Shira and Pninah and to all who were touched trough his rabbinate. Rabbi Vernon H. Kurtz, President Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Exec VP The Rabbinical Assembly
