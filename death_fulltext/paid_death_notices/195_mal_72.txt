        ROSEN-Shelly. April 8th, 1951-May 27th, 2000. When you died, family and friends lost the soft-spoken gentle man who listened without judgment and shared his boundless love. You overcame the hate and loss of love from your family to create a loving family with me. We had a love and commitment to each other that grew deeper and deeper. Together we shared art, music, literature and a commitment to social justice issues. You loved to read, watch old movies and debate about politics, religion, society, music and art. You had a kind and gentle wit. You were generous to a fault. I miss hearing your bass. I sorely miss you. I love you. Hop
