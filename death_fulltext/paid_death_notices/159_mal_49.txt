        KATZ-Eugene. The Board, Council, and staff of Planned Parenthood of New York City (PPNYC) mourn the death of Eugene Katz, a member of our Board of Directors for 26 years. Gene began his work with PPNYC as a volunteer phone counselor in 1972. He went on to serve as Chair of the International Committee, President and Chair of the Board of Directors, and most recently as an Honorary Board Member. We will long remember Gene for his unwavering commitment to this agency, and to the health and rights of women in New York City and all over the world. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to his wife, Zeborah Schachtel, and to his children, Barbara Eisold, Daniel and John. Wendy Mackenzie, Chair, Board of Directors Joan Malin, Chief Exec.
