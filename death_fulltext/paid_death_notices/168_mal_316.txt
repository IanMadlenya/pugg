The Workmen's Circle/Arbeter Ring mourns the passing of Will Stern, former Executive Director (1970-79), Editor of ''The CALL'' (1946-79), among other positions, a member since 1935. His commitment to our organization took him from the junior staff to its head. Secular Jewish life was his devotion and we his beneficiaries. We wish his family and friends strength and consolation.
