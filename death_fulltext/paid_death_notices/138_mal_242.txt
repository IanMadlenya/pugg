        PREY-Hermann. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of our dear friend and colleague, Hermann Prey. In his seven seasons with the company, he sang 66 performances and illuminated each of his seven roles with warmth and depth of understanding. He will long be remembered for his dashing Figaro and endearing Papageno. His Music Master, his Eisenstein, and his farewell role as Bechmesser vividly demonstrated the wit and elegance so characteristic of his art. Only last Spring, he gave a deeply moving recital of Schubert's final songs in New York, in partnership with our Artistic Director James Levine. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife Barbara and his three children. Joseph Volpe, General Manager James Levine, Artistic Director
