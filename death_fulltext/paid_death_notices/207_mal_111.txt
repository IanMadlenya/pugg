        KERLIN--Gilbert. The Board of Directors and staff of Wave Hill mourn the loss of our beloved Founding Chairman, Gilbert Kerlin. Gil was a man of true consequence and influence who led a long and full life. He understood and relished his ability to achieve change. It was Gil who rallied his friends and the community to protect Riverdale's remaining green spaces from over-development, among them the 28 acres comprising Wave Hill. Without Gil Kerlin there would be no Wave Hill. He and his first wife, Sally, who guided the creation of Wave Hill's education programs, have now both left this world much better than they found it. Our hearts reach out to his loving wife, Katie, his devoted children, Sarah, Gilbert and Jonathan, and his many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. David O. Beim, Chairman Kate French, President
