        VOGEL-David. It is with great sadness that Central Synagogue of New York City notes the passing of our Honorary Trustee, David Vogel, a wonderfully supportive and longtime member. David's youthful enthusiasm and consummate devotion to our congregation never diminished. Far more than through his official capacities, David demonstrated his passion for Central Synagogue in his continuing presence. He was always present as a great friend with a wonderful laugh and as an impeccable historian. David's stories about our congregational past provided a vibrant account of over a half century of synagogue life. He was adored by those of us fortunate to have known him. He will be greatly missed. Peter J. Rubinstein, Rabbi Samuel Wasserman, President Victor Muskin, Brotherhood President
