        CHYET-Stanley F. The President, Chancellor, Board of Governors and Overseers, faculty, administration and students of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, record with profound sorrow the death of Rabbi Stanley F. Chyet, beloved professor emeritus of American Jewish History on its Los Angeles campus. A conscientious teacher who has given to generations of students precious insights and understanding of the modern and American Jewish experience, Rabbi Chyet was a creative author whose writings have established for him a singular place among lovers and writers of poetry. Rabbi Chyet's counsel and expertise have been a guiding force for the American Jewish Archives, Edgar F. Magnin School of Graduate Studies and HUCJIR Skirball Cultural Center, as well as numerous academic assemblies and organizations. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his beloved wife, Geri, and his children Michael and Susan. May they find comfort together with all those who mourn for Zion and Jerusalem. Rabbi David Ellenson, President, HUC-JIR Rabbi Alfred Gottschalk, Chancellor Emeritus Mr. Burton Lehman, Chair, Board of Governors
