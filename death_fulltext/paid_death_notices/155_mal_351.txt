        COHEN-Albert. We note with sorrow the passing of a distinguished Trustee and dear friend to many. Albert Cohen was a true humanitarian, seeking to provide comfort and compassion to those in need, while asking nothing in return. His commitment to the extended community was to insure that the spiritual being as well as the physical were well cared for, and his generosity accomplished great things in regard to both. We extend our most sincere condolences to his family. Saul B. Katz, Chairman, Board of Trustees John S.T. Gallagher, CEO David R. Dantzker, M.D., President North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System
