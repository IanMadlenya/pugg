        ALLEN-Marguerite (Gracie). It is with great sadness that we announce the death at the age of 94 of our esteemed colleague and friend Gracie, who passed away peacefully at Lenox Hill Hospital after a brief illness. Gracie devoted her life to Douglas Elliman and more than anyone symbolized the great history and traditions of the firm. She joined Douglas L. Elliman in 1927 and for over 68 years served the firm with unquestioned loyalty and distinction. Douglas Elliman was both her life and her family and we all mourn her passing, remembering always her kindness and caring nature. Her concern for colleagues and her quiet dignity were standards to which we all aspire. The funeral will be private. A memorial service will be held Tuesday, January 28, at noon, The Little Church Around The Corner, 1 East 29th St. Howard P. Milstein Chairman Douglas Elliman
