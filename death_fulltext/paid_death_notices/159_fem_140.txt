        DELGAIS-Marisa. On April 14, 2000. It is with deepest sorrow and much regret that Valentina Lima Delgais announces the passing of her beloved mother and mentor. A pioneer of industry as the first woman ''builder and developer'' of New York real estate at a time when female executives were still thought of as ''glorified secretaries'' and ''honey'' was yet to be replaced with ''Ms.'' She earned the respect and admiration, and added a little magic, to those whose lives she touched. She will be particulary missed by her grandson Madison Marco Lima and Mr. Carlo Lima. Still too young. I love you, Mom. Visitation Tuesday 6-9 PM, John Krtil Funeral Home; Yorkville Funeral Service Inc., 1297 First Ave., NYC. Mass of Christian burial Wednesday 10 AM, St. John the Martyr Church, 250 East 72 St., NYC. Interment Gate of Heaven Cemetery.
