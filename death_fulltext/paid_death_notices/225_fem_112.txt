        McCORKLE--Margaret Olwen, who bounded across many stages in her lifetime, died October 15, 2005 after a brief illness. Maggie graduated from the U. of Kentucky with a BA in Drama and, after appearing in summer stock, landed in NY where she appeared in Julius Monk's cabaret revues and ''The Blue Angel.'' For many years, Maggie starred in musicals at Cherry Grove, Fire Island, while working in the concert management field. In addition, she protested the overbuilding of homes on Fire Island, battled organizations intent on destroying our beaches and bays and took her protests to Washington. She was not to be dealt with lightly. She was a witty, loving, thoughtful, and devoted friend who brought joy to many. We deeply mourn our loss and her wonderful spirit will be with us always.
