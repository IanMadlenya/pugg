        SILVER-Rabbi David L. Yeshiva University and its affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary mourn the passing of one of the oldest rabbinic alumni, who was spiritual leader of Kesher Israel Congregation, Harrisburg, PA, for 50 years until his retirement in 1983 and remained active in the community until last year. An internationally admired scholar and rabbinic leader, he received an honorary doctorate from YU in 1960. He was deeply devoted to his alma mater, working tirelessly to advance its various scholarship programs. The Rabbinic Alumni honored him in 1997 for his dedicated efforts. A man of both great charm and integrity, he was widely beloved and respected. We extend our heartfelt condolences to children, Rabbi Ahron (and Shoshana) Silver, Basya (and Larry) Zucker, Malka (and Joel L.) Morris, and Adina (and Rabbi Dovid) Cohen; sister, Yetta Izenstein, a YU Guardian with her late husband, Dr. Louis Izenstein; grandchildren; greatgrandchildren; and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University Robert M. Beren, Chairman YU Board of Trustees Julius Berman, Chairman RIETS Board of Trustees
