        PEARL-David. For our Uncle David. To my sister Mona, her children and grandchildren. We both share your grief at this time of David's passing and only hope that memories of good times you've shared, from the first Lindy's cheesecake to your many construction projects, will bring you eventual peace. Still, we'll all miss him. With much love to your family. George, Margie and Family.
