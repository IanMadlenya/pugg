        LIPSKY-Mortimer. The partners and staff of Lipsky, Goodkin & Co., P.C., mourn the passing of our esteemed partner and founder. His intellect, his passion for knowledge and learning, his resolve and determination, was an inspiration to all. He so ably taught and guided us. This compassionate man had a deep understanding and love for all mankind. He deeply loved his family, whom he protected, fought for, honored, and was so proud of. This was so evident in his actions and deeds. The love, devotion, care, respect, and dedication that he bestowed upon his wife Ann, who passed away, was admired & respected. To his children, Mark, Judy, Joel & Shari, his wife Norma, his grandchildren and great-grandchildren, our heartfelt condolences. Mort will be truly missed, but not forgotten.
        LIPSKY-Mortimer. Temple Beth-El of Great Neck records with profound sorrow the passing of its member, Mortimer Lipsky. We extend heartfelt sympathy to his bereaved family. Franklin S. Abrams, Pres. Jerome K. Davidson, Rabbi
