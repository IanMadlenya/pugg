        HIRSCH--Philip J. The partners, senior counsel, associates and staff of Proskauer Rose LLP mourn the loss of our dear friend and former partner. A brilliant lawyer and gentle man, Phil's piercing intellect, wisdom, civility, loyalty, wit and reassuring manner earned the lasting trust, respect and admiration of clients, colleagues and friends alike. His career at the Firm spanned more than 50 years. He served as a member of our very first Executive Committee and as Chairman of our Trusts & Estates Department. Selfless in his devotion to the greater community, Phil was a former Chairman of the Jewish Board of Family & Children's Services, Inc. and the United Way of New York City. He was a past president of the Greater New York Fund and a former vice president and trustee of the UJA-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York, Inc., whose Trust & Estates Section of the Lawyers Division honored him in 1995. Phil was a fellow of the American College of Trusts and Estates Counsel and a member of the International Academy of Estate and Trust Law. He also served our country as a captain in the U.S. Army from 1942-1946. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Judith; son, Lawrence; daughter-in-law, Iva, and grandchildren, Adina and Rebecca. Alan S. Jaffe Chairman Proskauer Rose LLP >>AD#
