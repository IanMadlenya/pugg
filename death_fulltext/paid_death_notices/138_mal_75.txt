        ROD-James P. The Board of Directors of Riverkeeper notes with great sorrow the death of Jim, age 53, our Vice President, on July 4 in New York City from cancer. A native of Ames, Iowa, he studied wildlife biology at Iowa State University and received a B.S. degree in journalism from Iona College. He was an educator and advocate who led a life in the exaltation and a defense of nature. In 1973, he became the Assistant to the President of the National Audubon Society, and in 1982 he assumed the post of manager and warden of Constitution Marsh Sanctuary in Garrison, N.Y., where, until a month ago, he established and ran an educational program for 5000 visitors a year. His favorite question repeated by every school child in the area was, ''Where do fish come from?'' His answer, ''Cattails,'' which provided a vivid lesson on habitat and the food web. Greatly respected, Jim received Audubon's Golden Egret Award last year. Our hearts go out to his wife, Dee, his mother and his brothers, Doug and Bill. There will be a service at 10:30AM, Thursday, July 9, at the Clinton Funeral Home in Cold Spring, N.Y. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to National Audubon's Jim Rod Memorial Fund to establish an endowment dedicated to the support of activities at the marsh which he loved and for which he did so much. Contributions should be sent care of, Constitution Marsh Sanctuary, RFD #
