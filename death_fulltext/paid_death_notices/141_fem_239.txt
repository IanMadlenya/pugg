        HIRSCHFELD-Janet. The Board of Trustees and the entire Ethical Culture Fieldston School community mourn the untimely death of our wonderful friend and dedicated colleague Janet Hirschfeld. For over 11 years Janet served the School in more ways than can be enumerated, most recently as assistant to the Director. A devoted parent to her daughters Jenny and Julie (Fieldston graduates) and soul mate to her husband Jimmy, Janet touched the lives of all those fortunate enough to know her. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Jimmy, Jenny, Julie and her entire extended family. Sara E. Nathan and S. Donald Sussman Co-Chairs, Board of Trustees Joseph P. Healey, Ph.D, Head of School
