        GREENE-Stuart Alan, died October 9, 1997. He was the cherished husband of his adored and devoted wife, Sherry, for the 33 years of their happy marriage, and the devoted father of Douglas, Stephanie and Bradley. Stuart was the older of the two brilliant sons of Dr. Barnett and Mrs. Lee Greene of Lawrence, Long Island, New York. Stuart was a graduate of NYU and earned a Master's degree in Hospital Administration from George Washington University. He served for several years as an Assistant Administrator at two hospitals in Manhattan until his health required the limitation of his professional activities to an office at his home in Cedarhurst. Stuart will be greatly missed by his younger brother, Dr. William H. Greene, who was devotedly responsible for the superior teamwork and treatment by personnel of the Oncology and Infectious Diseases Departments of the State University Hospital at Stony Brook, Long Island, during the five years of Stuart's unusual illness. Stuart's absence will be grievously felt by William's wife, Beverly, and their children, Ilyssa, David, and Lauren. Stuart's love of music, his sharp intelligence, remarkable memory and great sense of humor were qualities that made him a joy to know.
