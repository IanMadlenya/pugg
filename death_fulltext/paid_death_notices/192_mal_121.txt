        STERN-Gershon. The Yeshiva University family and Canadian Friends of Yeshiva University are deeply grieved by the passing of our beloved, longtime friend and distinguished leader who for more than 25 years was a member of the YU Board of Trustees. He also served as National President of Canadian Friends of Yeshiva University and was currently Honorary National President. He was a member of the Board of Directors of the Sy Syms School of Business (SSSB) where he and his wife, Merle, YU Benefactors, established the Gershon and Merle Stern Chair in Banking and Finance. He served as a past member of the Board of Trustees of YU's affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS). An alumnus of Yeshiva College, he also received an honorary degree from YU in 1984. Our heartfelt condolences are extended to Merle and their children: Sharon (and William) Hyman, Judy (and David) Lobel, Jonathan (and Kris) Stern, brother Zalman (and Barbara) Stern, and grandchildren: Caroline, Alexandra, Andrew, and Zachary. May the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University Ronald P.
