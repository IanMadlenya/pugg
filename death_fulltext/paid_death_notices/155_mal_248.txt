        PEARSALL-Paul. On December 18, 1999, in his 85th year. A lifelong member of the Baha'i Faith and recognized authority on President Woodrow Wilson. We deeply mourn the passing of this exceptional man of rare decency, integrity and intelligence. He could not be loved more by his survivors: his sister, Caroline; his nieces, Joan Robinson, Mildred Henriksen, Peggy Lucas, Gail Andersson and Susan Peters; his nephews, Gary Pearsall, Wallace Peters, Jim Lucas and Lars Andersson; plus seven grandnieces and nephews. Graveside services and burial at Forestgreen Park, Morganville, NJ, December 20.
