        SEROTTA--Harry. It is with great sadness that the staff of Schechter & Brucker, PC mourn the passing of our great friend. He was a wonderful father to his daughter Robin and his son-in-law Howard, and to those of us who were lucky enough to have known him. Our thoughts are with the entire Serotta & Schechter families. $(6$)#
