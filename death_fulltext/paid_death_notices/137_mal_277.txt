        JOSEPH-Peter T. American Ballet Theatre mourns with profound sadness, the tragic and untimely loss of Peter T. Joseph. Since joining the Board of Governing Trustees of ABT in 1991, Peter has been an extraordinary inspiration to the dancers, staff and his fellow trustees alike. With limitless energy and boundless optimism, Peter took on the challenge of leading ABT in 1993. The vigor and quality of the Company today are the result of Peter's singular personal investment and commitment and his sheer determination throughout these past five years as ABT's Chairman.
