        GINSBERG-Ida. The Faculty, Advisory Council and Alumni Association and staff of the Columbia University School of Social Work note with profound sorrow the death of Ida Robbins Ginsberg on April 13, at her home in New York City. The wife of our late Dean and Professor Emeritus, Mitchell I. Ginsberg, she was a devoted and beloved friend of the School and a generous contributor to the establishment of the Judith Ginsberg Memorial Scholarship, the Ida R. & Mitchell Ginsberg Social Policy Endowed Fund and the Ginsberg Professorship in Contemporary Urban Problems. She will be long remembered for her caring nature, warm and cheerful spirit and dedication to the objectives of social work. A memorial service will be held on April 27 at 2PM at the Riverside Chapel, Amsterdam Ave & 76 St, in New York City. In lieu of flowers contributions may be sent to the Ginsberg Social Policy fund at the School. Sincere condolences are extended to her sister and other members of the family.
