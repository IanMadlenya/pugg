        OSTROW--Robert W., 80, of Niantic, CT died Thursday December 21 after a long battle with pulmonary fibrosis. Beloved husband of Eleanor (nee Malkin) married for 54 years. Devoted father of Richard, Randolph and Ronald, father-in-law to Connie, Lesley and Mary and grandfather of Daniel, Michael, Theodore and John. Survived by dear sister Evelyn and her husband Dr. Jacob Weissman. He was a former selectman in Newfane, VT and Treasurer of the Chapman Farms Homeowners Association in Niantic, CT. Over a long life and many careers in finance and direct marketing he remained a champion of civil rights and the needs of the underprivileged and the disenfranchised. His devotion to the principles set forth in The Bill of Rights, and his deep commitment to public service, will always be remembered from his days as a volunteer lawyer during the Freedom Summers of the 1960s, through his work with The American Civil Liberties Union, his co-founding of both The National Welfare Rights Organization and The Mississippi Education Foundation, and finally as a Public Defender in Vermont and Connecticut representing juveniles, among America's most vulnerable and unprotected citizens. A memorial service will be held Sunday December 24, at 11 AM at Temple Emanu-El 29 Dayton Rd. Waterford, CT (860) 443-3005. Reception to follow.
