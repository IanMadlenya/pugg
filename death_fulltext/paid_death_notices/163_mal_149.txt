        WIRTH-Morris A. Surrounded by his wife Jean, sons Bob, Billy, and John, passed away peacefully on the morning of Saturday, August 12, after a brave battle with cancer. He was 76. In addition he is survived by his daughters-in-law, Kelly and Lisa, as well as Vasilia Hughes, and his most cherished grandson Alec. A lifelong resident of Manhattan and a prominent lawyer who represented Israeli interests in the U.S. for more than 35 years, Morris took great pleasure in generous helpings of political and philosophical discourse, frequently told jokes, and always delicious meals. But he lived to help others, whether with needed advice or unflinching support. The family will receive his friends and loved ones at the Campbell Funeral Home, 1076 Madison Ave, on Monday, August 14, from 5-8 PM. Funeral services will be held at 11 AM, Tuesday, August 15, at the Park Avenue Christian Church/ Universal Synagogue, 1010 Park Ave. Friends are also welcome at the interment service Tuesday at 3 PM, at the Westhampton Cemetery through Follett Funeral Home, Westhampton Beach, LI. ''So many dear friends-well wishers whose prayers will help and whose support of Jean and the kids is my greatest comfort.''
