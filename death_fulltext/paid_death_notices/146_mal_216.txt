        HORDES-Lawrence J., Rabbi. Beloved husband of his wife of sixtyfive years, Juliet Kronovet Hordes, died on Tuesday morning after a brief illness. He is also survived by his son, Dr. Jess N. Hordes and Naomi, two grandchildren, two great grandchildren. Rabbi Hordes had a long and distinguished career as a teacher in the NY public schools in addition to ordination in the 1929 class of Yeshiva University and a law degree from NYU. He was a gifted speaker, an outstanding educator and the truest embodiment of modern Orthodox ideal of combining Torah and Mada. He was always cheerful, inclusive, thoughtful, non-judgemental and devoted to his family, his profession and his people. His generous spirit will be sorely missed. Burial Wednesday, at 2PM, in the Old Montefiore Cemetery. Shiva in Silver Spring, Maryland. Contributions to Yeshiva University are welcome.
