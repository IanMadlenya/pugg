        STRAUSS--Libby. Of Miami Beach, FL., died Wednesday after a short illness. Libby led many lives in her 80 years-as an activist for a multitude of social and political causes, a food columnist for the Miami Herald, and a development officer for the Brandeis University National Women's Committee. She was married to her beloved Harold ''Ocky'' Strauss, a University of Miami Business professor, for 52 event-filled years and together they experienced life with a remarkable group of family and friends who maintained an unusually close bond. Libby was the best cook and hostess anywhere, enjoyed music, reading, traveling, keeping up with the news, but most of all she loved her six grandchildren: Benjamin, Matthew, Alexa, Madelyn, Rebecca and Adam. Her daughters and their husbands Charlotte and Michael Zinder, Valerie Strauss and Marc Levy, and Andrea and Mark Dettelbach, her sister Debby Israel, her many nieces and nephews, and her devoted friends will miss her great hospitality, wisdom and powerful spirit. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The Harold Strauss Endowed Scholarship Fund, University of Miami School of Business, POB 248032, Coral Cables, FL 33124-6521 or Brandeis University National Women's Committee, POB 549110, Waltham, MA 02454
