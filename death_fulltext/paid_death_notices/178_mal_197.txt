        FEINBERG-Abner W. On 8 November 2001 our Dad died in Scottsdale, Arizona of pneumonia at age 96 after seventy years of ardent involvement with the legal profession, 50 in active practice and 20 more as a special student at Arizona State University College of Law. Dad graduated from Columbia College in 1924 and from New York University School of Law in 1928. He then specialized in corporate, banking and life insurance law in Jersey City while living in South Orange, New Jersey. He was active in the Village of South Orange affairs. Temple Israel and Jewish Community groups. New Jersey Bar Association committees and numerous charitable organizations. He had two very happy relationships: first with our mother Jeanette who died in 1984 and later with Mrs. Ruth Einhorn. Besides his children Ellen and Jack, he leaves many friends and relatives who thought he was a very special person. Dad requested that any contributions be made to the American Red Cross, the American Jewish Committee or Arizona State University College of Law.
