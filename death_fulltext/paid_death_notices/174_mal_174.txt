        POTTER-C. Nicholas. The Board of Directors, Senior Management and Staff at J.P. Morgan mourn the loss of our dear and wise friend, C. Nicholas Potter. Mr. Potter spent over 30 years with the firm and his contributions were numerous and far-reaching. Nick began his career with J.P. Morgan in 1965 headquartered in New York, following service in the U.S. Navy. He was transferred to London in 1974 to create the firm's first ever international investment management unit. Nick returned to New York in 1979 to head investment research and in 1980, his responsibilities were expanded to lead investment policy. Nick was appointed Chief Investment Officer of Morgan's Trust and Investment business in 1981. He was named President of J.P. Morgan Investment Management upon its creation in 1984. Nick retired from the firm in 1997 and for the two years following, he served as a strategic advisor to the business. Mr. Potter was a leader in every way. He is widely recognized both by his colleagues and within the industry, as one of the early visionaries for our investment management business. He set the standard for both personal and professional integrity as well as fiduciary responsibility. We will miss him as a friend and colleague. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Clare and family.
