        RUBY-Arthur, M.D. We mourn the loss of Dr. Arthur Ruby, a most illustrous member of the Alumni of NYU School of Medicine.

He was loved, highly admired and respected by all he served and all who knew him. He was President of the Class of 1942 and led the Class for almost 60 years with extreme loyalty, dedication and devotion. He was proud of the Alumni of our school and we were always proud of him.

Eric and Kenneth Ruby, and to his entire family. Saul J. Farber, M.D., MACP The Frederick H.
