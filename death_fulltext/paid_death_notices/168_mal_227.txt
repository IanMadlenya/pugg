        LEUCHTER-Ben Zion. It is with great sadness that HIAS, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, notes the passing of our dear friend, longtime colleague and former president (1988-1992). His leadership, dedication and lifelong commitment to assisting Jews worldwide was truly inspiring. During the years of his great leadership, HIAS assisted more than 150,000 Jews from the former Soviet Union to escape persecution and build new lives in the United States. During a crucial turning point in world history, the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Ben Zion Leuchter's tireless advocacy on behalf of refugees was profound. Active in numerous Jewish organizations and co-founder of CLAL, Ben Zion Leuchter was a pillar in the American Jewish community. He was an accomplished journalist, editor and assistant publisher of the Vineland Times-Journal from 1949 to 1977. His devotion, warmth and vision will be sorely missed. Our heartfelt sympathy goes out to his wife, Magda and his entire family. Neil Greenbaum, Board Chair Leonard Glickman, President
