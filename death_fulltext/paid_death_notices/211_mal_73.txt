        REARICK--William R. Renowned art historian W.R. Rearick, 73, died in Venice, Italy on July 31, 2004. A memorial service was held on the island of San Michele on August 4. Curator of many exhibitions and author of numerous books and articles, he specialized in Venetian paintings and drawings from the 15th through the 17th centuries, and was perhaps the foremost authority on many Venetian artists, including Veronese and Bassano. Prof. Rearick was Prof. Emeritus in Art History and Archaeology from the University of Maryland, an honorary citizen of Bassano del Grappa and a resident of Venice. He was a member of the Board of Directors of Save Venice Inc. since 1993 and was an instrumental figure on Save Venice's Projects Committee. Save Venice is deeply grateful for his dedication, commitment, and wisdom, and notes his passing with profound sorrow.
