        DWINNELLS--Dana Wilson. Our best friend can never be described in words. All we can ever hope to do is to continue to live out the dreams he began with us. The love he brought to our lives can never be forgotten because every memory is over-flowing with his genuine smile, his laugh, and his real character. He will be a part of our lives forever. Services on Sunday, November 9, 11:00 AM at The Lillis Funeral Home, New Milford, CT, 860-354-4655. Laura, Ed, Daniel and Melody Merker
