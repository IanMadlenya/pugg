        DE KOONING - Willem. The Trustees and Staff of The Parrish Art Museum, Southampton, New York, join the international art community in mourning the loss of Willem de Kooning. His career spanned eight decades and saw the triumph of American painting in the world arena. His move to the eastern end of Long Island in the 1960s transformed his painting and made perceptible that light so distinct to this place. We extend our deepest sympathies to his daughter Lisa and her family. Mildred C. Brinn, Chairman Trudy C. Kramer, Director The Parrish Art Museum Southampton, New York
        de KOONING-Willem. The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art join the art community in mourning the loss of Willem de Kooning. Above all, however, we wish to honor his life. A great painter, he used that life to the full and contributed immeasurably to the medium he personified for over half of this century. ''Space,'' he said, ''is given to the artist to change if he can.'' No one of his era changed the space of modern painting more, or left a richer creative legacy. Ronald S. Lauder, Chairman, Agnes Gund, President, Glenn D. Lowry, Director, The Museum of Modern Art, NY
