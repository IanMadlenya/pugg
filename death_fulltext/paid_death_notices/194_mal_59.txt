        WEISSMAN-Paul. His initials alone, PW, conjure up an image: a man of vision and determination. A man sought out by family, partners, associates, clients, and friends for his wisdom, art of reasoning, and problem solving ability. PW was at once a compassionate benefactor, taking on others troubles as his own, and a hard bargaining businessman whose respect we all strove for. The lessons he taught us in life as well as in accounting, his marvelous sense of fairness, the warmth of his smile while in the company of those he cared aboutthese are our legacies as we take the Firm he built into the future. With gratitude for the blessings he has bestowed on all of us, The Frendel, Brown & Weissman family
