        WHITNEY-Ruth. The Board and Staff of the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund mourn the loss of our board member and friend, Ruth Whitney. A lifelong advocate for women and girls, Ruth Whitney brought wisdom, grace and commitment to her membership in the NOW LDEF Board. We benefited from her feminist leadership, her boundless creativity, and her down-to-earth good sense. We are grateful for her legacy, and we will miss her. We extend our sympathy to her family, especially her son Philip.
