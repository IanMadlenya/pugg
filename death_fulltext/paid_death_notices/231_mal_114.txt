        DiGENNARO--Philip R. We will greatly miss our ''larger than life'' friend, Phil, and are so grateful that our lives have crossed. As our colleague for many years, he brought intelligence, energy and most of all, humor, to all that he did. His many friends can't imagine life without him. Our love and sympathy to Marilyn and the entire DiGennaro family. Kathy and Jeff Nelson Alice Connell and Fred Giancola
