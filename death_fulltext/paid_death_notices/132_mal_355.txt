        AMSTERDAM-Jack. The Officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Jack Amsterdam, a generous supporter of UJA-Federation. Through his generosity to our Capital Development Fund, he strengthened health-care services at Long Island Jewish Medical Center and Mount Sinai Medical Center, and improved six UJA-Federation-affiliated community centers on Long Island. We extend our sincerest condolences to his beloved daughter, Dasha Epstein; his grandchildren, Robert and Danielle; his sister, Jean Ross; and the entire Amsterdam and Leviton families. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair Louise B. Greilsheimer, President Stephen D. Solender, Exec. V.P.
