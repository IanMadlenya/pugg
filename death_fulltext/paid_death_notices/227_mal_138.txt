        ALCINDOR -- Ferdinand L. Father of NBA legend and Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul Jabbar, died on December 9 at 3:00 P.M. EST at Coney Island Hospital in Coney Island, NY, from organ failure after a long bout with senile dementia. He was 86. A decorated member of the NYPD and veteran of the United States Armed Forces from 1941-1945, Mr. Alcindor received three commendations for outstanding police work as a patrolman in 1961 and then as a lieutenant in 1966 and 1978. In addition, he was awarded a medal at City Hall by New York City Mayor Abraham D. Beame. An avid musician, Mr. Alcindor brought his talents on the trombone to the New York Transit Authority Police Band, even playing at the 1962 Democratic National Convention. His musical talents also led to his involvement in one of the most famous events in U.S. history, as Mr. Alcindor was in attendance as a band member when Marilyn Monroe serenaded President John F. Kennedy with ''Happy Birthday'' at Madison Square Garden on May 19, 1962, an event, according to his son, he never forgot. Born in Brooklyn, NY, Mr. Alcindor attended Franklin K. Lane High School where he teamed with legendary Knicks coach Red Holzman on the school's handball team that captured the city championship. He followed that up by attending the Juilliard School to pursue his career ambitions of becoming a musician. Hopeful of one day playing with the Count Basie Band, Mr. Alcindor enjoyed working with some of the musical giants of his time, including Dizzy Gillespie, Art Blakey, Kenny Durham, Al Gray and Tito Puente. He also had a stint playing with the Benny Carter Band in the late 70's and early 80's. Married for 53 years, Mr. Alcindor's wife, Cora, passed away eight years ago. He is survived by his son, Kareem; and five grandchildren.
