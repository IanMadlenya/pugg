        SCHAFFER-Geraldine. The officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Gerry Schaffer, for 66 years the beloved wife of our cherished friend, Irving Schaffer, a former member of the UJA-Federation Board of Directors. A stalwart supporter of our mission, Gerry was active in the Westchester Women's Campaign. She and Irving earned enormous respect and admiration with their constant philanthropic commitment to the Jewish community. Their extraordinary devotion will be felt for years to come. Irving, an outstanding supporter of UJAFederation, was honored last year by the organization on the occasion of his 90th birthday. We extend our deepest sympathies to Irving; son Peter, a past chair of the Paper Division of the UJA-Federation Office Products Division, and his wife, Eve-Marie; son Andrew and his wife, Kiki; son Rick and his wife, Barbara; and son Robin and his wife, Queenie; and to the 15 Schaffer grandchildren. May her memory be a blessing. James S. Tisch, President Larry Zicklin, Board Chair and President-Elect John S. Ruskay, Exec VP & CEO Ernest W. Michel, Exec VP Emeritus
