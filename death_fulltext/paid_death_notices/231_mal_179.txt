        KARCHES--Peter F. On behalf of the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, we express our deep sadness over the loss of our friend and benefactor Peter F. Karches to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We greatly appreciate the Karches Foundation's generosity in a recent pledge of $10 million to support the CLL research and treatment program at The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research. This decision, made by both Peter and his wife, Susan, will make a difference in the lives of people everywhere. Their benevolence is helping us to further understand how CLL develops and discover new ways to tackle it, so that other families will be protected from similar tragedies. We extend our deepest condolences to Susan and the entire Karches family. Kanti R.
