        WILDER--Stephen F. 77, of New York City, died peacefully on October 27, after a long struggle with cancer. An urban transit advocate as well as environmental and community activist, he is survived by his wife, Miriam Fond, with whom he shared 35 years of that rarest of phenomena, a truly happy marriage. He attended Noble and Greenough School and was a graduate of Phillips Andover and MIT. Steve served on the Public Citizens Advisory Committee of the MTA for almost two decades and was a member of Manhattan's Community Board 5 for 15 years. Earlier in his career he served as a Technical Editor of ''Car & Driver'' magazine, built the Omega sports car, directed NYC's Vehicle Emissions Lab, and established safety standards for NYC's taxi industry. (Whenever you see a taxi's roof-mounted turn signal, thank Steve Wilder's inventive mind.) Nothing was sacred to Steve, who was able to find humor even in the most challenging situations. He was kind and generous to a fault. Idealistic, iconoclastic: one of a kind. We'll miss you, Steve. He is also survived by his sister Elizabeth W. Cady, a nephew Brian Cady, and nieces, Suzanne Cady Stapleton, Pamela Cady, and Shosha Fond Spivack. Contributions in Steve's memory may be sent to The New York Community Trust's ''Community Funds Inc,'' Attn: The Fosdick Fund, 909 Third Avenue, 22nd Floor, NY, NY 10022.
