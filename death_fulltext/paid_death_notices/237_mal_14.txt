        GALLO--Christopher Columbus. Passed away September 23, 2006. He was the kindest, most generous, brilliantly creative person we have had the privilege to know. He will always be loved and admired not only by our family, but all his friends and colleagues in the world of interior design. From the bottom of our hearts, we love you, Chris.
