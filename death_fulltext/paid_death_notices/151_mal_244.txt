        OTTO-Richard. We join Maria, Richard's children and Richard's many friends in mourning his untimely passing, especially noting his unparalleled will to overcome and persevere. After 50 years of friendship, I will sorely miss Richard's wit and company. His graceful and handsome presence will live on in the memory of all. Richard and Gail Maidman
