        STADTMAUER-Paula. We mourn the loss of our beloved wife, daughter, sister, mother and Bobbi. We stand amazed at the intensity of her talents and the breadth of her achievements. Her energy, devotion and great humor were the center of our lives and we grieve the loss of her magical touch. Her many family members and friends loved her deeply and their outpouring of affection and support is a great comfort to us now. As founder and director of Urban Employment Opportunities, she assisted so many in establishing secure and rewarding careers and thereby positively impacting upon thousands of others. Her life is best captured by Proverbs, ''Her children arise and praise her. Her husband lauds her. Many daughters have amassed achievement, but you surpassed them all.''
