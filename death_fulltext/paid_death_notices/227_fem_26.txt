Marks, realizing that her remains are not only in this plot of ground, but in every heart her life did touch. We are grateful for the years we shared with her, when she brought us so many pleasures and taught us so much by her example. To the world she was one person, to us she was the world. Alvin, Evan, Wendy, and Jeffrey
