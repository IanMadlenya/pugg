        HELLER-Jesse W., 81, handsome, charming, wise, funny, affectionate, irascible. Jesse earned his Doctor of Law Degree at Harvard Law School, served as an Intelligence Office in WW2, and practiced law in NYC. As Masonic Officer, he worked tirelessly for underprivileged children. He was a leading member of the Forest Hills Jewish Center. Jesse was predeceased by his parents Anna and Morris, brothers Irving and Arthur, niece Toni, and friend Norman Green. Venice Importing, the company founded by his father and built by his brothers, provided him with the means to give generously to many charities. Uncle Jesse is survived by his nieces and nephews Bette and Ronald Wagner, Susan and Buzz Warren, Dvorah and Dr. Joel Gorman; his greatnephew and niece Ian and Debra Warren; and his sister-in-law Dr. Hana Heller Ettinger, who together with her husband, Samuel, were the backbone of his support system. Services today at 1:30PM at Schwartz Brothers-Jeffer Memorial Chapels, Forest Hills.
