        McANENY - Ernest. Riverdale Country School extends its deepest sympathies to the family and friends of Ernest McAneny, the son of the School's first Chairman of the Board, an alumnus (Class of 1925), a revered former faculty member, and, in recent years, the School archivist. Ernest taught math, English and history to generations of fourth, fifth and sixth graders. An avid thespian and musician, he also coached actors throughout twenty-four years of Gilbert and Sullivan productions at RCS. As the School's first archivist, Ernest compiled a documented history of the School and was particularly proud of the photo catalogs of faculty and students. In recognition of his work as archivist, the Class of 1957 dedicated the Ernest McAneny '25 Alumni Room and Archives in his honor in 1997. An active alumnus, Ernest was twice awarded the School's Alumni Spirit Award in recognition of his work on behalf of the School. In 1998, he was honored when the Alumni Association Executive Committee unanimously voted to re-name the award the Ernest McAneny '25 Alumni Spirit Award. Part of our School family for more than eighty years, Ernest, or ''Mr. Riverdale'' as he was affectionately known, will be greatly missed by generations of Riverdalians. Richard S. Zinman, Chairman John R. Johnson, Headmaster
