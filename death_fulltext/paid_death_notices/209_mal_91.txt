        HEINIG--John, of New York City and Millbrook, NY, died peacefully in the presence of his loving wife, Jean, on May 31, 2004, at the age of 90. Born in Berlin, he and his family left Germany in 1933 after his father, Kurt Heinig, a Social Democratic member of the Reichstag, refused to sign Hitler's Enabling Act at the risk of his life. After living in Paris during the 1930s he and his beloved first wife Hilde reached the U.S. in 1941. During World War II he served in the U.S. Army as an intelligence officer. After the war he worked for Roussel Uclaf in pharmaceutical sales and later for ZetaPharm. Hilde died in 1966 and in 1967 he married Jean Owen, who became a psychoanalyst. In 1973 they bought a property in Millbrook, where he spent many happy hours working in the woods. After his retirement at age 80 he enjoyed showing tourists around the city as a volunteer and tutoring non-English speakers. John was a modest but extraordinary man, who despite the difficult era he lived through, always looked forward to new experience and new possiblities in life. He was a man of great kindness, gentleness, integrity and devotion. John is survived by his beloved wife Jean, who will miss him beyond measure. He will also be greatly missed by his niece Karin Heinig, nephews Per & Mikael Heinig of Sweden, nephews Karsten & Jakob Bronnum of Denmark & 8 grandnieces & grandnephews. A private memorial gathering will be held on June 24.
