        STEINER-Seymour, M.D. September 16, 2001, in Phoenix, AZ. Former resident of Mamaroneck, NY. Beloved husband of Arline. Loving and dearly loved father of Adam of Paris, Michele (Bruce) Ferguson of California and of the late Charles. Dear Zeder of Chelsea and Blake. Brother of Dr. Martin of Louisville, Joel of Phoenix and of the late Bob of New York. He received his medical training in Switzerland and during World War II enlisted as a Captain in the Medical Corps and served as a Battalion Surgeon in the Pacific Islands, where he was cited for Extraordinarily Meritorious Service. He practiced medicine in New York City, where he served three generations of families. He was a source of wisdom and intelligence, of humanity and grace. A musician and loyal friend, a man of honor and of non-judgemental love, he leaves the world bereft of his charm and love of life. Those who wish to honor his memory may contribute to the Steiner Memorial Fund, C/O Arizona Community Foundation, 2122 East Highland Avenue, Phoenix, Arizona 85016.
