        BAUMAN-Leah. The officers, members of the National Commission and staff of the Anti-Defamation League mourn the passing of Leah Bauman, beloved mother of Golda Foxman, mother-in-law of Abraham H. Foxman, ADL National Director, and grandmother of Michelle and Ariel. With her smile, sense of humor and compassion, Leah was a bright light to her family and all who knew her. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to Golda, Abe, Michelle, Ariel and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. David H. Strassler, Natl Chairman Peter T. Willner, Chief Operating Officer
