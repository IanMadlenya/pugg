        PYNE--Eben. The Juilliard community mourns the passing of Eben Pyne, trustee emeritus of the School since 2001 and a Board member appointed in 1972. With intelligence, elegance, and diplomacy, Eben served Juilliard in numerous ways. His wise counsel was of great importance to Juilliard at critical times in the School's history. A knowledgeable and dedicated supporter of all the performing arts, he was particularly involved in vocal arts activities at the School. Our condolences are extended to his wife, Nancy, and his entire family. Bruce Kovner, Chairman Joseph W. Polisi, President
