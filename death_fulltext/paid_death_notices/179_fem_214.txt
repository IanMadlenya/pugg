        KERLIN-Sally. Bank Street College of Education mourns the passing of Sally Kerlin, Board Chair Emerita, Life Trustee and beloved friend. She was a link in the strong chain of women who cared about the education of young children, and served them and their families throughout her lifetime. We will miss her wisdom and guidance and her vigilance which she showed throughout her fifty-five year association with Bank Street. To her husband Gil and all her family we extend our deepest condolences and thanks for having shared her with Bank Street throughout all these many years. Elizabeth S. Pforzheimer, Chair Augusta Souza Kappner, President
