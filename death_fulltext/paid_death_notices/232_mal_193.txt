        WILLIAMS--Ray. Died May 14 at NYU Medical Center which was a part of most of his life. Ray was the Administrator of the Department of Surgery under Frank Spencer, MD. About 40 years ago when his son Shawn had to tell his classmates what his father's work was, he said, ''My Dad tells doctors what to do.'' Well, that somewhat overstates it, but all at NYU who had contact with him knew he could things done and was so highly regarded for his ability as a facilitator. The general word was ''Go see Ray.'' Ray was born in Atlanta, GA and a graduate of Grady High School and Georgia Tech. He was enormously popular as a young man and was relied upon to be the organizer. This ability continued throughout his life. He organized numerous cruise trips among so many other activities for multiple friends. Ray was also a generous contributor to all equality causes. Ray is survived by his life partner of 40 years, Frank Folisi, his son, Shawn, daughter-in-law, Jasmine, and their children, David and Jennifer, and a brother, Graybill, of Orlando, FL.
