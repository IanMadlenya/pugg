        ABRAMS-Joseph. The Officers, Board and staff of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) mourn the passing of its respected Board Member Joseph Abrams. Deeply concerned about children's welfare and happiness, he supported JDC's efforts on behalf of Ethiopian Jews. We extend condolences to his wife, Judith, and family.
