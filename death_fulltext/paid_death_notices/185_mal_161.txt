        CARRUS-Gerald. The Department of Medicine, Division of Endrocrinology and the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center has lost a wise and generous advisor and benefactor. He was a valued member of the Diabetes Advisory Committee who played a key role in the founding of the Center. We are very grateful for his support of diabetes research programs at Columbia which helped establish the Gerald and Janet Carrus Professorship of Surgical Sciences and the Gerald and Janet Carrus Diabetes Research Laboratories, and to support the recruitment of new research scientists. We send our heartfelt condolences to Janet and his entire family. JoAnn M. Murphy, Joseph M. Murphy, Co-Chairs, Diabetes Advisory Committee Robin S. Goland, MD Rudolph L.
