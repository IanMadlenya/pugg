        COURTISS--Dick. You impacted the lives of thousands of children and adults. From your childhood days in Boston to your legendary career as an all-American lacrosse player and football player at Syracuse to building Camp Vega, one of America's premier camps, you gave 100% in all you did with the most unique flair. We loved sharing days and times with you ''on the road,'' in Maine, in New York and in Duxbury. Thousands of campers and counselors were privileged to know you. We were privileged that you ''let us in.'' We miss you already. We will always be The Three Amigos. We're here for Kyle, Steve and the Courtiss family.

        $(6$)COURTISS--Dick. May 2, 1936September 23, 2006. It is with great sorrow that Camp Vega for Girls mourns the loss of retired camp director and past co-owner of one of Maine's premier girl's camps. Dick shall be dearly missed by Vega's family, alumnae and friends. Dick was a dedicated camp director who imparted inspirational messages to both campers and staff alike. Dick's direct, concise messages reminded young people that they should believe in themselves and acquire a good work ethic while being a good person. Dick's philosophical messages were often relayed through football coaching terms which inspired the camp community in recognizing ''team'' responsibility and maintaining a winning spirit. As a past team member of the Syracuse lacrosse and football teams, Dick's messages will continue as a legacy to all who knew and loved him.
