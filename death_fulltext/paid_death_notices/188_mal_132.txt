        MITCHELL-Bruce W. The staff and board of the Alliance of Resident Theatres/ New York are profoundly saddened by the passing of our friend and Board member Bruce W. Mitchell. Bruce's passionate concern, clear headed analysis, and unwavering belief in our mission have made this a better organization. And his tremendous generosity, dignity and humor have made all of us who work here better human beings. He was adventurous, he lived his life to the fullest and he could give a hell of a party. Our thoughts are with his amazing wife Carol, his children and the rest of his family. Virginia Louloudes Executive Director
