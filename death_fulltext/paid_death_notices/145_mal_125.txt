        LEONTIEF-Wassily. The members of the Department of Economics at New York University note with sorrow the passing of our colleague, Wassily Leontief, who joined our Faculty in 1975. Wassily served as a model to all of us in the Department and we will feel his loss. Our sympathies are extended to his wife and family.
