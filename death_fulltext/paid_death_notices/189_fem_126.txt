        LUCAS-Nancy. The Board of Trustees, faculty and families of Grace Church School and the Board and families of Early Steps honor the memory of Nancy Lucas. As a Trustee she was a voice of wisdom. She brought humor, intelligence and wit to every event. She was an ambassador for independent schools and their missions to New York City and beyond. In her work for A Better Chance, she was a tireless advocate for providing access to independent schools for all children of New York City. We will miss her bright smile, energy and friendship.
