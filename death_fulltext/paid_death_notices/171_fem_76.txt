        PEARSON-Sadie (nee Margolin). Loving aunt to Claire and Barry Siskind, Harriet Ziefert, Buzzy Margolin, Carrie Margolin and Craig Margolin, and sister-in-law to Wilma Margolin. Loving sister and friend to Lee Wassner for 83 years. Hard working, conscientious and loyal. Tough to the end with a heart of gold. Cards for every birthday and holiday never forgotten. Those who knew her, loved her. Rest in peace, Claire.
