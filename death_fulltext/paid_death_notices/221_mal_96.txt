        HORWITZ--Marshall S., M.D. All the staff members of the Department of Pediatrics of the Children's Hospital at Montefiore and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine are stunned and saddened by the sudden passing of our beloved colleague of nearly 40 years. The quintessential physician-scientist, Dr. Horwitz, Professor of Pediatrics and Cell Biology and Professor and Chairman of Microbiology and Immunology, was an outstanding clinician, researcher, and teacher, as well as one of the world's leading experts on adenovirus. Marshall stood out for his gentlemanly character, modesty, integrity, warmth, and wisdom; he had the unique ability to bring out the best in every person he trained and with whom he worked. After winning international renown for discovering how genes encoded by adenovirus caused disease, Marshall, in characteristic fashion, converted those disease-causing genes into therapeutic tools to cure diabetes mellitus. Marshall was tirelessly and enthusiastically devoted to mentoring and nurturing the careers of generations of students, pediatric residents, fellows, scientists and faculty members. Marshall will be keenly missed, but his impact as an exemplary role model and his countless contributions to our Department, our Medical School, and the world of Medicine, will endure for generations to come. Gabriel Haddad, Chairman Department of Pediatrics Children's Hospital at Montefiore and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine
