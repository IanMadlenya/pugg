        McMENAMIN--Joan S. The Trustees, Headmaster and Faculty of the Buckley School in the City of New York mourn the passing of Joan McMenamin--our beloved Trustee. Joan was an enduring friend of the Buckley community. She unfailingly brought wise counsel to our deliberations, based on long and considered experience, unerring intuition about all people, especially young people, sheer magnanimity of heart, and an irrepressible sense of humor. We will miss her deeply. Gregory J. O'Melia, Headmaster Brian R. Walsh, Headmaster Emeritus Ogden N. Lewis, President Board of Trustees
