        WELKOWITZ - Joan. New York University's Psychology Department mourns the loss of Dr. Joan Welkowitz who died February 11. Recently retired as Professor Emerita, she was on the NYU faculty for more than forty years and headed the Doctoral Program in Clinical Psychology. In long association with the NYU Medical Center she researched and published widely regarding emotional expression in faces and voice as manifested in various psychiatric and neurological disturbances. She was highly regarded for her textbook on statistics, now in its seventh edition. We extend our condolences to her family and many former students.
