        ISAACS-Peggy. The Board of Directors, staff and members of the Central Queens YM & YWHA record with deep sorrow the passing of Peggy Isaacs, wife of our esteemed benefactor and former president, the late Edward Isaacs. The Isaacs family's generosity has enabled generations of Jewish campers to attend our resident camp, Camp Edward Isaacs, which is honored to bear the family name. To her children, Jed Isaacs and Madeline Noveck, and their families, we extend our deepest sympathy.
