        HAUSMAN-Jack. The Officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York note with sadness the death of a legendary figure, Jack Hausman. Throughout his distinguished life, he was deeply committed to helping the less fortunate in our society. Along with his brothers, he was among the founding fathers of our organization who built for the future while honoring the past. Though the community is diminished by this loss, we derive strength from the memory of his dedication and vitality. We extend our condolences to his sons, Richard and Michael; his brother, Leo; his grandchildren and great-grandchildren; and all the members of the family. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair James S. Tisch, President Stephen D. Solender, Exec. V.P.
