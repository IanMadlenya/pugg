        LIPTON -- Solomon. Passed away November 15, at 89, as a result of complications from open-heart surgery. The devoted father of Roger, David and Marilyn. The beloved grandfather of Leslie, Hannah, and Benjamin. The loving brother of Marty and the late Ruth Weisman. He lived a full life, a dedicated family man, a consummate professional (C.P.A.) to the end, skied into his late seventies, played singles tennis into his late eighties, self sufficient and competent until he entered the hospital three weeks before his passing. Didn't want to be inactive or dependent in his last years, which his failing heart would have undoubtedly created. Philanthropic and generous in spirit to all he came in contact with. He was a mensch in every sense of the word, and his memory will inspire all who knew him. He showed us how to live, and he showed us how to leave. Services will be conducted at the Menorah Chapel on Vaux Hall Road, Union, NJ on Monday, November 17, at 11:30 AM.
