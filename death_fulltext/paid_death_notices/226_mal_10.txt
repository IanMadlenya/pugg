        WEIZNER--Oscar. The New York Philharmonic mourns the passing, on October 29, of Oscar Weizner, 83, a violinist with the Orchestra from 1962 until his retirement in 2003. A native of Dresden, Germany, he came to the U.S. in 1938 and subsequently performed with the Pittsburgh Symphony, the Radio City Music Hall orchestra, and The Metropolitan Opera Orchestra before joining the Philharmonic. ''A violinist was what I wanted to be, to play in a fine orchestra,'' he once said. Our condolences to his wife, Judith, his children William Weizner and Denise Weizner Mananas, and family. Lorin Maazel, Music Director Members of the Orchestra Paul B. Guenther, Chairman Zarin Mehta, Pres/Exec. Dir. Members of the Staff
