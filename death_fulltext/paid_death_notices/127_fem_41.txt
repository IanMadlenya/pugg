        WERTHEIM-Edith. ''Edzia'' to those who knew and loved her. Beloved wife of Samuel. Devoted mother of Elliot, and mother-inlaw of Ellen. Loving grandmother of Aaron. On August 6, 1997. A survivor of the Holocaust and one of the first women on ''Schindler's List,'' her generosity of spirit, strength of character and unyielding will to survive was, and always will be, an inspiration to all whose lives she touched. The family would like to express its sincerest appreciation to Dr. Mary Ann McLoughlin of Mt. Sinai Hospital in NY for her extraordinary care and concern. She was a friend and a true humanitarian and for that we will always be grateful. Edzia, Mom, Grandma-you will always be with us. Funeral services Friday, August 8, Schwartz Bros., 11403 Queens Blvd, Forest Hills, 11AM
