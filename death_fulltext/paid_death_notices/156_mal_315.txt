        AXENFIELD-Sidney. After a brief illness, Sidney Axenfield (formerly of New York City) passed peacefully in his 90th year at Hearthstone, Lee, Mass., on January 19, 2000. A veteran of World War II, Sidney returned to New York in 1946 and completed his degree at City College. In his professional life Sidney was a chartered accountant and maintained an independent practice in New York until his retirement. Those who knew Sidney will always cherish his love of family, literary works, classical music, his humanitarian causes, his generosity and superb sense of humor. Sidney's family would like to extend their appreciation to the staff at Hearthstone, the Berkshire Medical Center and HospiceCare of Lee. In particular, we wish to thank Charles Redd, his nurse at Hearthstone, as well as Dr. Jay Ellis of Pittsfield, Mass., and Dr. Patricia Bloom of New York City for their special care of Sidney. Predeceased by his wife, Fay (Rothe), in 1988, and his brother, Dr. Milton Axenfield, in 1998, Sidney is survived by his beloved daughter, Alice, and son-in-law, Dr. James Storm, of Ancram, N.Y.; beloved granddaughter, Stephanie Ava, and her husband, Richard Keller; great-granddaughter Samantha Fay Maelen of Leonia, N.J.; grandson Ivan Goldberg of Millbrook, N.Y.; niece Ellen Axenfield Kohler of Berkeley, Calif.; nephew Howard Klumack of Hollywood, Fla.; Allen and Therese Axenfield of Warrensburg, N.Y.; and granddaughter Allyson. Funeral arrangements are being made for a private service. However, the family will be sending invitations for a memorial celebration of Sidney's life in the spring at the family residence, StormField, in Ancram. In lieu of flowers, please support Sidney's favorite cause, Amnesty International.
