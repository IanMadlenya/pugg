From 1948 to 1958 he was a professor of zoology at Yale University and from 1958 to 1975 he taught in the field of anatomy and neurophysiology at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. He is survived by his wife Clara; his son Theodore, his daughters Linda Shen, Joan Woo and Corinne Wong; six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
