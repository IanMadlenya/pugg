        SCHWARCZ-Ernest. The President and Faculty of Touro College in New York and Jerusalem, deeply mourn the tragic passing of Professor Schwarcz, a devoted and esteemed friend and guide.

We are saddened by the loss of this extraordinary intellectual leader, a most decent human being and the void that he leaves. Our condolences to Martha, his beloved and devoted life partner.
