        SCHIFF-Herbert H. American Friends of The Hebrew University deeply mourn the passing of Herbert H. Schiff, of Columbus, Ohio, and Sarasota, FL. He was a dedicated leader and supporter of many local and national organizations. As a long-time supporter, he formerly chaired The Audit Committee, and served on The Board of Directors. He was also an Honorary Governor of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Our deepest sympathies go to his wife, Betty, and his entire family.
