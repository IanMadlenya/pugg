        PLACZEK-Adolf K. Dolf died peacefully at his home on March 20th, having recently celebrated his 87th birthday. Born in Vienna, he came to the United States in 1940. After serving three years in the U.S. Army, he returned to his position at the Avery Architectural Library of Columbia University. In 1960 he became Avery Librarian and Professor of Architecture. Upon his retirment in 1980, he continued, with unfailing grace and erudition, to devote himself to the preservation of the architectural heritage of his adopted country. He is survived by his wife, Beverley, by a large and extended family, by those beloved people chosen as family, and by his sister and brother-in-law, Susan and Paul Stern, their children and grandchildren. In memory of Dolf and in lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Buildings of the United States or to Doctors Without Borders. A memorial service will be held at Calvary Church, Park Avenue and 21st Street. The date and time will be announced later.
