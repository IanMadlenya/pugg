        DRIMMER - Harold. The Board of Trustees, the Foundation's Board of Directors, and the grateful student body of Westchester Community College grieve for their distinguished friend, benefactor, and leader. For more than two decades, Harold Drimmer served devotedly and successfully as Chairman of the Board of Trustees and as an organizing founder of the college's Foundation. This period brought enormous progress including economic stability and innovative academic programs. He received respectful admiration for his vital role in positioning the institution among the elite of community colleges not only in New York State but throughout the country. His unswerving belief in the value of higher education for all who seek it was consistent and constant and his intelligent leadership helped achieve his lofty goals. Gratefully, we extend our heartfelt sympathy to the Drimmer family. Hon. Timothy S. Carey Chairman, Board of Trustees Dr. Joseph N. Hankin President Betsy Stern, Chair Westchester Community College Foundation
