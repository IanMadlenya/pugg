        OLESEN--Claus. On August 3, 2006 New York City lost a beloved resident, Claus Olesen, 65 years old. Born in Copenhagen, Denmark, he spent 40 years living as an American citizen here, a place very close to his heart. A graduate of Hunter College, Claus was an avid participant in the City's social and cultural circles as a gifted poet, painter, photographer, and was also involved in amateur theater. His greatest passion however was film, having amassed a collection of over 2,000 works from various genres complete with personalized reviews and critiques. As a testament to his character, Claus has donated his collection to a film institute where it will continue to bring joy and knowledge to others for years to come. A world traveler who brought love and spirit into the lives of all he touched, Claus will be greatly missed by his former co-workers at the Milliken Textile Company, where he would still visit even after his retirement, and by his friends and family in New York and abroad. He is survived by twin brothers Jens Olesen of Sao Paulo, Brazil and Lars Olesen of Copenhagen, Denmark. A memorial service will be held on Friday, September 8, 12 o'clock noon at St. Luke's Lutheran Church, 308 W. 46th St. NY, NY 10036
