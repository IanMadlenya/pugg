        LEVIN-Neil D. With deep sorrow, the Wexner Heritage Foundation mourns the untimely death of its alumnus Neil D. Levin, who lost his life in the vicious attack on the World Trade Center. A passionate leader, Neil served his community as executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. He also was president of the Commission on the Recovery of Holocaust Victims Assets, and helped bring a measure of justice to the Jewish people. Our deepest condolences go to his wife, Christine, and to his other family members and many friends. May the memory of his extraordinary life be a blessing to us all. Rabbi Nathan Laufer, President Rabbi Herbert A. Friedman Founding President Emeritus
        LEVIN-Neil. To the Levin family, Neil was a jewel in the crown of life. His great friendship and good humor lightened up our lives. We miss him. Love, Rick, Maura, Brian and Julia.
