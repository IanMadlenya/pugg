        STONE-Martin. The remarkable Martin Stone died on Sunday, June 7, 1998. He led the most distinguished, diverse and dynamic life. His interests were broad and deep, and he brought his keen wit, intelligence and informed wisdom to all he considered and undertook. The gamut of his key involvements ranged from serving as attorney for the Lend-Lease Administration and helping to launch the G.I. Bill of Rights during the Roosevelt Administration to his Peabody Awards for ''The Author Meets the Critics,'' and ''Howdy Doody.'' He was a charter member of The New 42nd Board of Trustees and was invaluable in helping to guide the direction and pro-active decisions of the Board. We will miss him, his sage advice, his eloquence and his grace. All of our heartfelt condolences to Angela and to Martin's family. The Board and Staff of The New 42nd St. Marian S. Heiskell, Chairman Cora Cahan, President
