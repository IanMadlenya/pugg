        DeCARLO -- Charles. Sarah Lawrence College mourns the passing of its president emeritus, Charles DeCarlo, who served from 1969 to 1981. We are indebted to Charles who brought his financial and administrative acumen to transform the face of the campus and revitalize the College's financial underpinnings, while remaining true to its spirit. A Renaissance man equally at home in the world of business and academia, he will be missed for his joie de vivre and dedication to the College. We extend our sympathies to his wife, Dorothy, and children. A memorial service will be held at the College in the Spring. Michele Tolela Myers President Robert Riggs Chairman of the Board
