        SUROVY-Walter. The Metropolitan Opera mourns with profound sadness the death of our very dear friend, Walter Surovy, the beloved husband of Managing Director, Rise Stevens. An elegant gentleman, he was a friend to many at The Metropolitan Opera. Deeply committed to the company, both Mr. Surovy and Miss Stevens were founding members of The Encore Society. Born in 1910 in Vienna, Walter was a renowned actor with The Neues Deutsches Theater in Prague when he met Miss Stevens, then a fledgling singer. He gave up acting professionally to manage Miss Stevens' opera career, including 23 seasons as one of The Metropolitan Opera's leading artists. His irreverent wit and friendship will be missed by many members of the Board and Met management. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Rise, their son, Nicolas, daughterin-law, Marguerite, and granddaughter, Marisa. Bruce Crawford, Honorary Chairman James Kinnear, Chairman of the Board Paul Montrone, President Joseph Volpe, General Mgr. James Levine, Artistic Dir.
