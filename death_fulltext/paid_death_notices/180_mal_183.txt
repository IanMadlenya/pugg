        SHEA-Tom. Died yesterday morning after a valiant struggle with cancer. Throughout his illness he maintained the same zest and zeal that characterized his life-he lived abundantly. A member of the New York and New Jersey Bar Associations, Tom worked in transportation law and taught courses in law. More recently, he worked in residential real estate in New Jersey. His wife Mary, and children Joe, Todd, Kristin, and Elizabeth will be hosting a celebration of Tom's life this Saturday at 11 AM at the Immaculate Heart of Mary Church, Scotch Plains, NJ. He is also survived by 3 sisters: Patricia Draddy, Betsy McDermott, and Marijean Sommer. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Atlantic Home Care and Hospice, 33 Bleeker Street, Milburn, New Jersey 07041.
