        CORSER-Paul. The Board, staff and volunteers of the Treatment Action Group mourn the sudden, premature loss of Paul Corser. As a colleague, a friend and a person living with AIDS, Paul inspired us with his passionate commitment, despite the challenges of his own illness, to the search for an AIDS cure and a vaccine. He never swerved from this quest. No matter how badly AIDS ravaged his body, Paul remained unfailingly cheerful and optimistic. His life's work is a legacy which will continue to inspire us in coming years. Our thoughts are with his loving wife, Sally Morrison, his family and his colleagues at AMFAR.

        CORSER-Paul. The Board of Directors and staff of the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition (AVAC) express our deep sadness at the loss of our colleague Paul Corser, Program Officer at the American Foundation for AIDS Research (AmFAR). In the struggle to end the AIDS epidemic, Paul was smart, dedicated, and real. He will be missed by many. Our sympathies go to his family and coworkers at AmFAR.
