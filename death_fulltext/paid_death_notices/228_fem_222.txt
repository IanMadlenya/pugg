        MAYNARD--Joan. Pratt Institute is proud of Joan Maynard's extraordinary contributions in preserving and gaining recognition for Brooklyn's historic Weeksville neighborhood. Her persistent, inspired efforts led to saving this long forgotten group of cottages that were once the home of 19th century African Americans. Joan was a dedicated and energetic leader in historic preservation locally and on the State and National levels. She was a great friend, colleague and supporter of Brooklyn and its astounding history. We will miss her greatly. Thomas F. Schutte, President, Pratt Institute Robert Siegel, Chairman, Board of Trustees Pratt Institute
