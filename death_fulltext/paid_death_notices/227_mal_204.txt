        ANDERSON--Jack. PARADE magazine mourns the loss of a dear friend and colleague. In addition to his long and illustrious career as a Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaper columnist, Anderson was the Washington bureau chief for PARADE, penning more than 200 articles on politics and world issues since the mid 1950s. Whatever his focus, Anderson employed tenacity and integrity with equal measure. We will miss him. Our deepest sympathies are extended to his wife, Olivia, their children and grandchildren. Walter Anderson Chairman, PARADE
