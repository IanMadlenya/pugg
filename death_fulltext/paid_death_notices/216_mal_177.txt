His leadership in enhancing our great museums and parks and his selfless public service will forever grace our city. Cooper Union extends its heartfelt condolences to his wife Ruth and his entire family.

We extend our deepest sympathy to his family. His true commitment to remembrance, continuity and preserving Yidishkayt is exemplified in his work with YIVO, the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Museum of Jewish Life in Jerusalem. His dedication to YIVO, to problem-solving and to planning for the future has inspired us all. He will be sorely missed. May his memory be for a blessing. Bruce Slovin, Chairman Dr. Carl J.
