        NOWLING-Steven Paul. November 23, 1950 to August 3, 2002. The family, friends, and co-workers of Steve Nowling mourn his unexpected death. He was much loved for his vibrant spirit, generosity, and wry wit. Steve's life was dedicated to those in need: as an intern in Louisville KY at the Catholic Worker, as an RN and nurse practitioner at St. Vincent, Manhattan with AIDS patients and the AIDS clinical trials unit at Beth Israel Medical Center. He is survived by his daughter Amber, father Jack, sisters Margaret, Judith, Mary, Carolyn; brothers Michael and Christopher. We invite his friends and co-workers to join us in celebration of his life on Sunday, August 11 at the Church of the Ascension, 221 West 107 Street (betw B'way and Amsterdam). Mass 3:30 PM, reception 5:00-6:30 PM.
