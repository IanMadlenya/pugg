        LEHMAN--Rabbi Emeritus Dr. Robert L. In New York City, on June 13, 2003. It is with great sadness that the Officers, Board of Trustees, Clergy and the entire membership of the Hebrew Tabernacle Congregation deeply mourn the sudden passing of our beloved and esteemed Rabbi Emeritus Dr. Robert L. Lehman. Born in Germany, he emigrated to the United States in 1938. Rabbi Lehman was a graduate of Stuyvesant High School and was ordained from Hebrew Union College in 1954. He served with distinction as our Rabbi for 41 years. After his retirement he served as an interim Rabbi at both Or Chadash in Vienna, Austria, and later at Temple Israel in Lawrence, LI. Rabbi Lehman earned his Doctor of Ministry degree from the New York Theological Seminary in 1985. As a member of the Central Conference of American Rabbis he served on several of its national committees. He was President of both the New York Association of Reform Rabbis and the American Federation of Jews from Central Europe. He worked tirelessly on the Executive Committee of the World Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors. Rabbi Lehman is survived by his devoted wife Loni and their daughter Sharon, as well as his many friends and devoted congregants of the Hebrew Tabernacle. We will miss his wonderful and joyful presence in our congregation and in our lives. Funeral services Monday, June 16, 11 AM, at the Hebrew Tabernacle Congregation, 551 Fort Washington Avenue, NY, NY, at West 185 St. Contributions in memory of Rabbi Lehman can be sent to the Hebrew Tabernacle. Stephen L. Berkowitz, Rabbi Michael Kruk, Cantor Mark S. Hamburgh, President >>AD#
