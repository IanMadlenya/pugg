        FREEMAN-Mark. Died on February 6 at age 94. Predeceased by his wife of 67 years, Polly Allen. Survived by two loving sons, David and Stephen, and seven grandchildren. A noted artist whose prints and paintings from the 1930's chronicle a seminal period of New York City's architectural growth in a style that has been described as ''a beautiful blend of the poetic and historical.'' His works are represented in the collections of the world's leading art museums, including the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Whitney Museum, the British Museum, the Corcoran Gallery, and the Library of Congress. He gave generously of his time to support the cause of art and artists, serving as executive officer to numerous art organizations. He was a lifetime Honorary Member of the Lotus Club and has had one-man shows at the Hirschl & Adler Gallery and the Sylvan Cole Gallery in New York. In 1992 he published a book of his work from the 1930's, ''Reaching for the Sky''. A man with a great passion for life, his passing leaves a void which will be sadly felt by friends and family.
