        BENIOFF-Florence. The Jewish Braille Institute of America joins in mourning the passing of the beloved mother of our President, Barbara Friedman. Throughout her life she was truly honored by her family in the devotion shown to her, the respect for her independence of spirit and the warmth that she inspired. She encouraged public service and nurtured the talents and values of those who were close to her. May those who will miss her find comfort in loving memories.
