        DAVIS-Martin. A sister Department of Pediatrics in NYC recognizes the major contribution of Mr. Martin Davis to furthering the cause of children's health here in NYC. As former Vice Chairman of Pediatrics at Montefiore Medical Center and a contributor to the initial steps of the creation of the Children's Hospital at Montefiore, I came to respect with the deepest admiration Mr. Davis' commitment to children in need. His desire to create a superb Children's Hospital for children in the Bronx and nearby communities was reflective of his overall values in providing the best for children. The children's environment and I, as an advocate for children, will miss his devotion, creative leadership and dedication. My sincerest condolences to the family and friends who have lost such a distinguished leader. Steven P. Shelov, MD, M.S. Chairman, Dept. of Pediatrics Maimonides Medical Center Professor of Pediatrics S.U.N.Y. Health Science Center at Brooklyn
        DAVIS-Martin S. You are now on the Board of Angels. We'll miss you. Love, Karyn and Chuck Lewis
