        KALLIR--Lilian. The House of Steinway & Sons deeply mourns the passing of the eminent American pianist, Lilian Kallir, on October 25, 2004 at the age of 73. Lilian Kallir was a treasured member of our Steinway Artist family for nearly 50 years. An inspired soloist, eloquent chamber musician, and a beloved teacher and mentor, Ms. Kallir possessed the most vibrant and nurturing of musical souls. From the time of her debut with The New York Philharmonic at the age of 17, her work and her life have inspired all fortunate to know her and hear her play. Our fond memories of Lilian will continue to enrich us, and we convey our love and heartfelt condolences to Claude, Pamela, Andy, and her entire family. Bruce A. Stevens, President Peter B. Goodrich, V.P., Worldwide Concert and Artist Activities
