        DeWIND-Joan. The Board and staff of the Charles H. Revson Foundation send our profound condolences to the DeWind family on the passing of Joan, wife of Adrian DeWind, former chairman of our Board of Directors. A noted butterfly and moth expert, she was passionately committed to the protection of nature's creatures and the habitats that sustain them. To walk around her garden or picnic with her by a pond was to be led by the elegance of her descriptions into a world inhabited with infinite varieties of life. We will miss her adventuresome, caring spirit. Robert S. Rifkind, Chairman Eli N. Evans, President
