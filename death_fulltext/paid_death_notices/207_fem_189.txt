        WORSLEY -- Joyce. The American Musical and Dramatic Academy mourns the death of Joyce Worsley. It is with great sadness that we learned of the passing of Ms. Worsley. Ms. Worsley, who enjoyed a distinguished acting career in England and the United States, was associated with Philip Burton in helping to found the school in 1964. Throughout her life, Ms. Worsley generously shared her vast and extraordinary knowledge of the theatre with countless appreciative students. From 1970-1975, Ms. Worsley served as the Director of AMDA. Her courage, warmth and tireless dedication during those years are fondly remembered and highly treasured. We send our heartfelt sympathy and deepest condolences to her family.
