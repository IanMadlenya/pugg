Beloved wife of the late Marcus Franks, loving daughter of the late Abraham and Ruth Kutner, dear sister of the late Seymour Kutner and the late Blanche Kutner, dear cousin of Florence Kaufman, adoring ''aunt'' to several generations of cousins. Estelle was a wonderfully vibrant person who lived and celebrated her life until her demise. Services 12:45PM Sunday, January 16 at ''The Riverside'', 76th St. and Amsterdam Ave., NYC. In lieu of flowers contributions may be made to either Urban Pathways, Inc., 875 8th Ave., NY, NY 10018, an organization which provides a continuum of care for New York's homeless, especially those who are chronically mentally ill, or the Food Drive of Congregation Rodeph Sholom, 7 West 83 St, NY, NY 10024, which benefits organizations providing food for those in need.
        FRANKS--Estelle. Our friend, neighbor and mentor. We will miss her love, spirit, opinions, insight, wit and joie de vivre. Her memory will live on in our hearts, but she will be sorely missed. Stephen M. Sheinbaum and Barbara T. Kaplan
