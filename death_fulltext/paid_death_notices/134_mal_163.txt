        GARDNER-Stephen. Steve Gardner, ''Shy'', born Christmas 1908 in New York; a Brooklynite for life, though he lived there only from 1915 to 1936; intellectual, raconteur, bibliophile, gourmet; a powerful presence in the lives of all those he touched, young and old; died March 10, 1998 in Santa Monica, CA, with his wife, Diana Gardner, his children, Joel Gardner and Andrea Fellows, and his best friend, Leo Melzer, by his side throughout his last struggle. His face is now amid a crowd of stars. Or, in his words, ''my compliments to the chef.''
