        BONDER-Rabbi David. We record with sorrow the passing of our beloved colleague. Born in 1906, he served as JWB Midwest Regional Director before making aliyah. In Israel, he served our movement as assistant director of the Center for Conservative Judaism in Jerusalem. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his widow, Ruth, and his daughter Bayla Rae, and all who were touched through his rabbinate. Rabbi David L. Lieber, President Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Exec. VP, The Rabbinical Assembly
