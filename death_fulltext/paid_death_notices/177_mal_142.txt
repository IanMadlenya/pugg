        WALD-Victor. On September 11, 2001 Victor was tragically lost in WTC 1. People were drawn to his wisdom, irreverent wit, integrity and humanity. Victor was a scholar of history and religion and a keen observer of world politics. An institutional broker with Avalon Partners, Victor was held in high esteem by his colleagues. His proudest accomplishments were his wife Becky and beautiful daughters Alex and Dani. He was the beloved son of Fani and Dolphy and adored brother of Clarissa. Victor was also a cherished nephew, cousin, uncle and friend. He will be sorely missed by all who knew and loved him.
