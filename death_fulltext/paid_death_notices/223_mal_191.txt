        FRIEDMAN--Jack N. It is with great sadness that the Inner City Scholarship Fund family notes the passing of a longtime member of our Board of Trustees and Executive Council. Our hearts go out to his wife, Lorraine, his three children, and a host of grandchildren in this time of loss. His deep commitment to our students will not be forgotten.
