        BENNETT--Pearl. We longtime friends and admirers of Pearl Bennett mourn the death at 92 of our dear and gallant friend. Deeply concerned following a devastating accident that irrevocably changed her life, we united to help Pearl as she contended with grave injuries. A delight to all throughout her life, Pearl enriched ours with her interest in everyone and everything, especially music and Democratic politics. She had been Manager of Dessoff Choir and worked enthusiastically on behalf of many liberal causes. She was a tireless, inspired hostess who never let an occasion go uncelebrated. Pearl's elegance, dignity and courage persisted in the aftermath of her accident. She demonstrated strength, grace and generosity toward those entrusted with her care. She leaves behind these grateful friends.
