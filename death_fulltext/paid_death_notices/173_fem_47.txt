        GORGE-Valerie Anne. On May 26, 2001, at age 34, of Paris, France, and New York City. Treasured wife of John S. Rogers Jr., beloved daughter of Gerard and Martine. We will remember her truly courageous spirit as she endured a lengthy and difficult treatment for leukemia. Family and friends will also remember her fearlessness, dignity, and remarkable passion for life that lasted right until the end. She passed peacefully with her loved ones by her side. Her family and friends gratefully thank the dedicated doctors and staff of N.Y.U. Medical Center and the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. In lieu of flowers, please donate to the cancer research center of your choice and spread the word that both blood and bone marrow donation play a critical role in the battle against all cancers. Please donate in Valerie's honor. She will live forever in our hearts and memories.
