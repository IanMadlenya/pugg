        STEVENS-Roger. The faculty and staff of the North Carolina School of the Arts and Chancellor Alex C. Ewing wish to express their deepest sympathy to the family of Roger Stevens. He was the first Chairman of the School's Board of Visitors and our performing arts theater in Winston-Salem is named after him. He was revered by those who knew him and regarded as a towering figure and a champion of the arts.
