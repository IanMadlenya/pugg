        CHO-Morley. The Board of Trustees of the China Institute in America mourns the passing of our friend and colleague Morley Cho. As a Trustee Emeritus, with his commitment and dedication for over a quarter of a century, he has contributed immeasurably toward building China Institute into the preeminent center for learning about China that it is today. China Institute's members and staff extend deepest sympathy to his beloved wife Nancy and daughters Emily and Renee. We will all miss his guidance and wisdom.
