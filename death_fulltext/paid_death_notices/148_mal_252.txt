        BASTIS-Christos G. The Board of Directors of Atlantic Bank of New York, the Chairman, Theodoros B. Karatzas, the President and CEO, Peter L. Venetis, along with all the officers and staff, express their deepest sympathies to the family of our beloved and faithful Director Emeritus Christos Bastis. One of the most successful GreekAmerican immigrants to this country, he was a pioneer in his professional, cultural and community activities. To Atlantic Bank, as its longest sitting director, he was a contemplative leader that bridged the gap between the newly arrived and the settled and who taught us to appreciate and preserve Hellenic art, culture and spirit. We extend our sincere condolences to his widow Josephine; children Christopher, George, Jason and Betty; and all the grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
