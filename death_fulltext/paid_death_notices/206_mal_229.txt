        HOLLAND--Ira E, Businessman, Advocate and Founder of Concepts of Independence, Inc, dies at 64. In 1955 Ira contracted Polio that left him a Respiratory Dependent Quadriplegic. He was dependent upon people for all of his care and upon machines for each breath he took for the remainder of his life. Although this life-shaping event placed many obstacles in Ira's path, he found ways to overcome or go around most of them. Despite his disability, he traveled, married his late wife Victoria; graduated from LIU with honors; worked to create and shape the first consumer Directed Personal Assistance Program in NY State; was an advocate for Non-Invasive Ventilation and other issues that affect severly disabled people; and he was able to create a life in the Roosevelt Island community after spending more that 21 years in a hospital. Ira is survived by his family & friends, that include Maria A. Manrique, a person who played a significant role in his life for more that 20 years; Ed Litcher who became more of a brother than a friend; Margo and John--friends who shared the 60's & the years beyond; Michael who gave good counsel, even when Ira didn't listen; his Personal Assistants Ibeth, Susana, Tamara and Ann; each member of his family that he was close to; and all of the physicians, advocates and fellow disabled persons with whom he worked with on the many projects he was devoted to. As a colleague and friend wrote upon hearing the news, ''we are all a little more alone now.''
