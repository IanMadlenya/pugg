        NEWTON-Douglas. The Trustees and Staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn the loss of Douglas Newton, revered colleague and friend, who was chairman of the Department of the Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas from 1974 until his retirement in 1990. During his distinguished career, he organized scores of exhibitions, and edited or authored more than 24 publications on the arts of the Pacific and other subjects. Formerly Director of the Museum of Primitive Artwhich was given to the Metropolitan in 1969 by Nelson A. Rockefeller-he first arrived at the Metropolitan with the enormous task of transferring that Museum's art collections here. He then supervised the ambitious project to design and open in 1982 the Metropolitan Musuem's Michael C. Rockefeller Wing. He was named the Evelyn A.J. Hall and John A. Friede Chairman of his department in 1982, and upon his retirement was elected a curator emeritus, remaining deeply involved in his scholarly work at the Museum until quite recently. Douglas was an inspiring scholar, teacher and friend who will be missed greatly. Philippe de Montebello, Director
