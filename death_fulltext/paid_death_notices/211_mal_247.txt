        APPLBAUM--Rabbi J. Shelley. The Moriah School of Englewood deeply mourns the passing of our esteemed Rabbi Emeritus, principal and pillar of Torah education, Rabbi J. Shelley Applbaum. Rabbi Applbaum was principal of Moriah for 18 years and had a major impact on the lives of thousands of students, staff members and parents. He was the architect and leader of our yeshiva. His loss will leave a significant void throughout the Jewish community. We extend condolences to his dear wife, Marilyn, and his entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Mr. Sam Moed, President Dr. Gerald Kirshenbaum, Principal
