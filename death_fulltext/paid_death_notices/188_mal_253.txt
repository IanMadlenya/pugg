        KARP-Dan. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society deeply mourn the loss of Dan Karp of Sarasota, FL., and formerly, Great Neck, N.Y. A longtime member of our Board of Directors, Mr. Karp, along with his wife, Joyce, lent his support to a variety of projects, including the New York Metropolitan Region Physics Wing, the Florence and Jack Bellock/Southern Region Dormitory and the Opto-Electronics and Solid State Electronics Center. His generous support and positive leadership will long be remembered and cherished. We extend our condolences to his wife, Joyce, and the entire Karp family.
