        PARKER-Kellis. The Columbia Law School faculty, staff and nearly three decades of students deeply mourn the untimely passing of Professor Kellis Parker, a member of the faculty since 1972. Professor Parker's classes in contract law and seminars on the music industry, remedies, and the roots of African-American law educated and edified many generations of students. We will deeply miss the optimism, enthusiasm and generosity he brought to every endeavor. The Law School Community extends its heartfelt sympathy to his family. A memorial service will be held this Sunday, October 15, 1:30 PM at St. Paul's Chapel on the Columbia University Campus. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that gifts be made to Columbia Law School for the Kellis E. Parker Memorial Scholarship Fund. Dean David W. Leebron and The Columbia Law School Community
