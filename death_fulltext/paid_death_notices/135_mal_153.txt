        MURRAY-Roger F. The Board of Trustees, Headmaster, Faculty, Staff, and the entire Collegiate School community mourn the loss of our Distinguished Alumnus and Life Trustee, Dr. Roger F. Murray 2nd'28. A dedicated educator who believed strongly in the importance of pre-college education, Dr. Murray provided leadership and meritorious service to the school for fifty years, serving on its Board of Trustees from 1949 until the present and as President of the Board from 1968-72. Dr. Murray's long stewardship of Collegiate was marked by both eloquence and warmth. His unwavering commitment to the traditional values of Collegiate School along with his clear view of the future served as guidance over many years to his colleagues on the Board and to Collegiate School. His encouragement of faculty enrichment and development will serve as a living legacy of his devotion to education. We shall miss him greatly and extend our sincere condolences to his wife, Agnes, his son, Roger F. Murray 3rd'64, and the entire Murray family. Jeffrey P. Klein '61, President of the Board of Trustees Jacob A. Dresden, Headmaster
