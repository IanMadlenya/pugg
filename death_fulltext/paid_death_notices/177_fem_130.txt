        MILLER-May. On Oct. 10, 2001. Devoted mother of William and wife of the late Max Katz. The Board of Directors and Staff of The New York Gracie Square Hospital mourn the loss of their former Administrator, who served with un- wavering dedication from the founding of the Hospital in 1959 un- til her retirement in 1985. She was a firm but gentle leader who was ad- mired by her associates for her selfless commitment to patient care and for her skills in blending differing approaches into a solution with a human touch. She will be missed by us all. Frank J. Bruno, President Robert J. Campbell, MD Medical Director Cynthia Zirinsky Co-Founder-Trustee
