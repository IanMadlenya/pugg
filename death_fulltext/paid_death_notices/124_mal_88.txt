        BOLDER-Solomon J. The management, staff and employees of Refron, Inc. are shocked and deeply saddened by the sudden loss of our dear friend, accountant and financial advisor Solomon Bolder. With his creative, bubbling mind and his engaging, irrepressible spirit, he became quickly a friend of everyone he met. For over thirty years he had our admiration and affection. We shall miss him deeply and express our sincerest sympathy to his dear wife Alba, to his caring children Arthur and Paula, Larry and Eva, and Sara, and to all his sparkling grandchildren of whom he was so proud. We express our sincerest sympathy also to his former wife Claire, the mother of Arthur, Larry, and Sara, and to Marco and Gabriella, the children of Alba, as well as to his sisters, Ruth, Natalie, and Sally. May the entire family find comfort and strength to overcome this great loss. Leonard A. Kestenbaum Jay J. Kestenbaum Gerald I. Kestenbaum
