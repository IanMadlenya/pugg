        KANDELL -- Florence. 1906-2004. The International League for Human Rights mourns Mrs. Florence Kandell, our beloved compatriot, fellow human rights advocate and member of our Board of Directors and Governing Council. As the League's Representative at the United Nations, Mrs. Kandell, in her quiet but effective manner, fought for the rights of women, Soviet Jews, politcal prisoners and promoted the League's family reunification program. Florence was a cherished friend of the International League for Human Rights for over three decades and her work represents the most golden moments in the League's history. Her commitment to the pursuit of justice and the preservation of human dignity will remain a lasting legacy never to be forgotten. She will be dearly missed by all who knew and worked closely with her. The League wishes to extend our deepest sympathy to her daughters Alice, who currently serves on the League's Board, and Leslie and to their families.
