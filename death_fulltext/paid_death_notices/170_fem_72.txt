        NELSON-Portia. Our beloved Portia was granted her wings on the morning of March 6. Both onstage and off, this extraordinary and caring woman inspired us all with her talent, courage, wisdom, and genuine goodness. Her music and love will live on in our hearts forever. A memorial celebration of her life is being planned for a future date. Details will be made available on a website created in her honor-http://members.tripod.com/portianelson. Memorial gifts may be sent in her memory to The Actor's Fund of America, 729 Seventh Avenue, NYC 10019. Friends and family of Portia Nelson
