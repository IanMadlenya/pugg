        GOODMAN-Judd Gary, M.D. Age 49. Gynecologist who devoted his professional life to providing safe services to women, died in Fort Worth, TX on March 26, from complications due to cancer. Dr. Goodman graduated Harper College, Binghamton, New York in 1974. He studied at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, TX from which he graduated in 1978. He completed his residency at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City. He practiced gynecology in Hollywood, CA, New York City, and Fort Worth, TX. His love for medicine and women's health was but one side of this enigmatic person. He was an entertainer-only Jackie the Jokeman knew more jokes than Judd. He was a wonderful piano player. He was witty and erudite, a lover of classical and contemporary music. He was a scientist, an amateur astronomer and a master mechanic who could fix anything. He was a loving husband and devoted father. In addition to his daughter Julie Ellen Goodman, he is survived by his wife Evelyn, mother and stepfather Esta and Richard Friedman, sister Claudia Goodman, niece Loni Goodman, numerous aunts, uncles and cousins. He will be sorely missed by everyone who knew him. A memorial service was already held. Donations can be made either to NARAL or Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, TX.
