Beloved husband of Helene Phillips, devoted father of Julie, Thomas and Lydia, father-in-law of Dr. Robert Desnick and Roy Landesberg, adoring grandfather of Stuart, Eddie, Celia, Paige, Jonathan, Emily and Sam. He was a Princeton graduate, member of the New York Stock Exchange, founder, chairman and president of P. R. Herzig and Company.
