        MENDOZA--Dr. Barbara M., died at her home on October 26, 2003 of lung cancer. In 1940, Eleanor Roosevelt invited a few college students to tea at the White House. Dr. Mendoza was at that meeting, which set the course for her life. Mrs. Roosevelt was very enthusiastic about the role of women, whether they were homemakers or career women. In each case, she said there were three things women should always be interested in-politics, education and the arts. Dr. Mendoza followed this advice in her personal and professional career. She was awarded a B.A. from Brooklyn College, a M.A. from Columbia University, and a Ph.D from New York University. For 20 years, she headed the Drama Dept. at St. John's University, Staten Island. She was a member of Common Cause, Amnesty International, Planned Parenthood, the National Democratic Party, and the New York Speech Association. She was a member of The Cosmopolitan Club in New York City and served on the Board of Governors. She is survived by her husband, Wyn, who has proved to be trustworthy, beloved and amusing for over 60 years, by her daughters, Kathy, Susan, Liza and Julie, and by her grandson, Joseph.
