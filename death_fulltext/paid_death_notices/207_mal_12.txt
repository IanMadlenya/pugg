        GLICKSMAN--Jack. 12/9/1915--4/2/2003 First Lieutenant, U.S. Army Air Force, World War II (Europe); Insurance Broker for 55 years; owner of Aster Agency (insurance brokerage) from 1978 to 1992; married to his beloved Lettie (nee Berger) for 60 years. You filled our world with your love, your humor, your unquenchable zest and wonder at the world, your mighty efforts to make things right for us, your goodness. We take comfort from one of your many poems: ''I have had more than the allotted time for man--so mourn not for me today... I enjoyed the wonders of youth A great enduring love Much loved father Patriot soldier And to the end Joyous in the wonders Of each new day.'' Lettie Glicksman, Jane Glicksman, Hallie Schmidt, Dede, Stephen and Carla Kessler
