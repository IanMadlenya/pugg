        GREENSTEIN-Joseph. Age 78. With heavy hearts and great sadness we say adios to our dear Yussy. Husband, father, uncle, grandfather, teacher and mentor. A self made man who truly did things his way. After serving with the armed forces in World War II, he became a very successful builder of private homes throughout Westchester County. In later years, he and his spectacular wife of 53 years, Miriam, owned and operated Su Casa, a unique summer resort hotel in upstate New York. Every winter for 35 years, they spent in the Yucatan on Isla Mujeres, Mexico, where they pioneered a lifestyle and built a beautiful home on the water. Yussy, there was no one like you. You'll be in our hearts and minds forever. Rest in peace. We all hope for happier days to come. Shiva will be observed at 12 Wilkie Avenue, Kingston, New York. With much love, The Greenstein, Soltanoff, Wolfson, Silverstein, Lisack and Schwalbe Families.
