        HURWITZ -- Thelma (nee Gold). July 20, 2004. The world has lost a truly unique woman who has left an indelible mark on all who knew her. Predeceased by loving and beloved husbands, Rabbi Abraham Hertzen (1950) and Joseph Hurwitz (1988), Thelma's devotion and love for her children, Barbara Hertzen, Michele Friedman and Elliot Hurwitz, went beyond a mother's love--she was our confidant, ardent supporter and best friend. Her favorite role was granny to Andrea and Robert Friedman, and Whitney, Joshua and William Hurwitz. She was the devoted daughter of the late Rebecca and Michael Gold, and sister of Dr. Arnold P. Gold and the late Bernard Gold. The ''Queen of Camping,'' as she was known, was revered and loved by generations of campers who grew up and thrived with ''Aunt Thelma'' every summer at Camp Derry and Camp Camelot. Her leadership in the professional community and Jewish volunteer world helped many organizations grow and flourish. How do you sum up the life of such an incredible woman--except to say that everyone loved you, Thelma! Funeral services Thursday, July 22, at 11 AM, Boulevard-Riverside Chapels, 1450 Broadway, Hewlett, NY. As a way to perpetuate Thelma's memory and to thank the wonderful staff and doctors at Calvary Hospital, please make contributions to: The Calvary Fund, Camp Courageous, 1740 Eastchester Road, Bronx, NY 10461-9955.
