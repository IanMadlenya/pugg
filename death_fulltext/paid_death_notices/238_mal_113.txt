        BRADLEY--Ed. For each of us, Ed was like that smile of his...warm, generous, funny, incomparable. He was also brilliant and courageous. He illuminated our times, our joys and our most terrible conflicts. He was deeply principled and unswervingly loyal to his friends and to countless causes and communities. He changed the world around him in ways small and large. He was a breaker of barriers, revered by America and a hero to so many of us. He sang the blues and lived his music. And he loved Patricia boundlessly. He was a friend we will miss forever. Bless Patricia. A bright noble sun too soon set. Gordon J. Davis Peggy Cooper Davis Lizzy Cooper Davis Margarett Cooper
