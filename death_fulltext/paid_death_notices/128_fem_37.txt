        SPENCER-Diana. Profound sorrow at her death and deep gratitude for her friendship and generosity at the time of The Royal Visit in Chicago to benefit our cancer support community are offered in memory of Diana, Princess of Wales, by members, staff, Board and Founding Development Committee of Gilda's Club, the free, non-profit program based in New York, and in development in North America and London, England. The Princess of Wales expressed in the acts of her life her belief that we are here to help one another, to open our hearts, to give and to understand. The effects of her kindheartedness and compassion will live on. We are privileged to have known her and extend condolences to all who loved her as we did.
