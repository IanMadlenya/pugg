        ROBERTS-John. The Trustees and staff of Expeditionary Learning Outward Bound mourn the loss of John Roberts, a trustee and friend whose intelligence, humor and grace set him apart, and at the same time connected him to us and to everyone. We offer our sympathy and support to his wife Rona, his daughter Jennifer and his son Douglas. Lee Klingenstein, Chairman Greg Farrell, President Expeditionary Learning Outward Bound
