        HUMPHREYS-George H., M.D. The Columbia University Department of Surgery mourns the loss of our beloved and esteemed former Director and Chairman, and Valentine Mott Professor, Dr. George H. Humphreys, who died December 18, 2001. He was appointed Chairman in 1946, at age 43, and over a span of 23 years he guided the Department's growth and renown. He pioneered the discipline of cardiac surgery in New York City, and earned world-wide recognition for innovations in esophageal surgery. He is perhaps most respected for establishing this department as one of nation's top training centers for surgeons in his day. He trained scores of surgeons, may of whom have gone on to distinguished careers of their own in academic surgery and clinical practice. Our sincere condolences to his wonderful family.
