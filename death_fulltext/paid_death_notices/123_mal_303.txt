        BALLON-Frederick E.M. Fred Ballon was one of the great lawyers. He was incisive, clever yet pragmatic. He was my mentor, my advisor and my best friend throughout my legal career. He taught me to be a lawyer and not merely a practitioner. I will miss his wisdom, his guidance and most of all him. Condolences to Sydell and the rest of his family. Ron Itzler
