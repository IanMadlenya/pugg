        BERNBAUM - Glenn. I was shocked, a sharp feeling of loss overcame me when Mimi came back from that phone call and said Glenn is dead. How could it be? My mind replayed a scene with Glenn when the two of us were having lunch in my office and my secretary walked in saying Kennedy has been shot. Our lives had been closely intertwined. Glenn ran my business, the Custom Shop, for 17 years. One day he said: ''why can't I drink at my own bar?'' Then he said: ''I want to open a restaurant.'' Glenn really knew food and Glenn could cook. For him it would be a hobby and, crazy as it may sound, I encouraged him to go ahead. Glenn continued to run my business on a part-time basis (now from noon to 5 daily) for the next 3 years and with very good reason he was proud of Mortimer's Restaurant. We celebrated my 80th, 85th, and 90th birthdays there, and on each occasion, Glenn created a beautiful setting-a completely new Mortimer's-revealing his creative imagination. Glenn had become family and we shall miss him. Mimi and Mortimer Levitt
        BERNBAUM-Glenn. The patients and staff of the Center for Special Studies at the New York Presbyterian Hospial are shocked and saddened by the loss of our benefactor Glenn Bernbaum. Glenn was an intensely private man who downplayed his own contributions to the fight against AIDS. Yet his ability to rally some of the most powerful people in our community to the cause of the stigmatized and powerless was unique. That ability made a profound difference in the lives of thousands of New Yorkers with HIV. We will deeply miss his steadfast support and friendship. Jonathan L.
