        DEUSCHLE-Kurt W., M.D. It is with profound sorrow that The Mount Sinai Alumni mourns the passing of our dear friend and colleague. Dr. Deuschle served as the Ethel H. Wise Professor and Chairman of the nation's first urban department of Community Medicine, which he established at Mount Sinai in 1968. In 1989, The Mount Sinai Alumni presented its most coveted award, the Jacobi Medallion, to Dr. Deuschle in acknowledgment of his many contributions to the delivery of health care throughout the world and the great distinction he brought to Mount Sinai. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his family. Jeffrey S. Freed, M.D.-Pres. William G. Stein, M.D.-V.P. Maria L. Padilla, M.D.-Secy. George Raptis, M.D.-Treas.
