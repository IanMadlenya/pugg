        BRENNAN--Vincent P. The Board of Directors and Staff of Lighthouse International mourn the passing of Vincent P. Brennan, longtime member of the Board of Directors, steadfast friend and generous supporter of our work. In his twenty years of service, Vincent served as Vice Chairman, and on the Finance and Administration Committee, but the task which he performed with singular distinction was his leadership of the Research Advisory Commmittee for our Arlene R. Gordon Research Institute. His commitment to the Lighthouse, and the acuity and thoroughness he brought in all matters, made him a most respected friend. For all these reasons, he will be missed, but always admired. Our heartfelt sympathies go to his wife, Mary, and family. William B. Follett Chair, Board of Directors Barbara Silverstone, DSW President and CEO
