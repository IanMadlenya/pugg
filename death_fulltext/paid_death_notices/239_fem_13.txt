        $(6$)WEBER--Joann. Having arrived one day before your Halloween debut in 1948, our lives have moved in parallel for 58 years. Margaret and I cherish the memories of the evenings we spent with you and Drew when we were all first married, and although we haven't seen you in recent times our thoughts have always been with you. If it is true that we live on in the works we accomplished and the memories of those we touched then you have left a legacy of caring, love and unending courage that will be with all of us forever. Our thoughts and prayers go out to your entire family. You were a wonderful wife, mother, sister, daughter and friend. Your incredible broad smile is the picture we will always remember. Robert and Margaret Fagenson
