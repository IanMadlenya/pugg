        MANTON--Sir Edwin A.G. The employees, management and Directors of American International Group, Inc. (AIG) are deeply saddened by the death of our friend and longtime colleague, ''Jimmy'' Manton, one of AIG's founding fathers and a giant of the international insurance industry. A man of uncommon modesty, generosity and kindness, Sir Edwin was born and raised in England and always retained his British citizenship. He passed away in New York City on October 1st. Sir Edwin joined what was then the C.V. Starr insurance group in 1933, the predecessor of AIG, and remained with the organization throughout his career, rising to be a Director of AIG, Executive Vice President and finally, Senior Advisor. He built AIG's international propertycasualty insurance business over many decades into the leading such organization in the world today. His passion for the company he served never diminished and he continued to come into the office regularly until recent days. He was knighted by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in 1994 for ''charitable services to the Tate Gallery'' with the title of Knight Bachelor. British art and literature were a passion of Sir Edwin, and he was exceedingly generous to the Tate over the years. As a tribute to his adopted country, Sir Edwin created in 1987 The American Fund for the Tate Gallery. His charitable and philanthropic interests also included the New YorkPresbyterian Hospital and the Church of the Ascension in New York City, where he served as Treasurer, Vestryman and Warden. Sir Edwin was married for 67 years to the former Florence V. Brewer who passed away in 2003. He is survived by his daughter Diana H. Morton of Wayland, MA; two granddaughters, Julia Grenville Morton Krapf and Toby Morton Niles; and five great-grandchildren. We extend our deepest sympathies to Sir Edwin's family and grieve with them for this remarkable man. Martin J. Sullivan, President and CEO American International Group, Inc.
