        USDAN-Suzanne. The Board of Directors of the Usdan Center for the Creative and Performing Arts sadly extends condolences to the famly of Suzanne Usdan and to the world of philanthropy in the arts and education. Sue Usdan was the consummate benefactor. Visionary in leadership, steadfast in values, gracious in guidance, and unassuming in spirit, she endeared herself to all the colleagues and friends who were privileged to know and work with her. Sue personified the civility and urbanity of New York where, for decades, her generosity made great things happen. She provided the model for all those who serve our city and nation. The Usdan Board will be the lesser for her absence, secure however, in the lessons she shared with her husband Duke and taught her adoring children John, Adam and Esme, and her beloved grandchildren, which now comfort the rest of us. Jerrold Ross, President Dale Lewis, Executive Director
