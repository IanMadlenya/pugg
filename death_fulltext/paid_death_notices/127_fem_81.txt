        BUNNELL-Naneen. The Philharmonic-Symphony Society of New York, Inc. notes with sadness the death of Mrs. C. Sterling Bunnell, a loyal friend of the Orchestra and its dedicated supporter. A member of the board of trustees from 1959 to 1985, Mrs. Bunnell also served as Associate Chairman of the Society's Auxilary Board-precursor to the Volunteer Council. Her guidance helped to safeguard the gift of music for future audiences. We extend our deep condolences to her family. Kurt Masur, Music Director Members of the Orchestra Paul B.
