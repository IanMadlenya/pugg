        SPIVACK--Edith. We mourn the passing of the widow of the late Bernard H. Goldstein, senior partner of Tenzer Greenblatt, Blank Rome's New York predecessor. Spiv, as she was affectionately known to us, was an extraordinary woman. Her remarkable 70 year career will forever be an inspiration to female attorneys and indeed all attorneys. Our heartfelt condolences to Edith's family. Blank Rome LLP
