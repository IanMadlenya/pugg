        TIERNEY--Marge. In loving memory of my dear friend Marge. Her caring and dedication to those less fortunate inspired everyone. To her family, colleagues, friends and the disabled whom she served, she was an example of love and acceptance. Her untimely death is an incalculable loss. We shall mourn and miss her. For information regarding funeral services, call 508-752-0486. Louise Friedman
