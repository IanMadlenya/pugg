        $(6$)STEVENS--Nathaniel H. Papa Nat, accused of having lost your taste buds, a bad rap in my opinion, made me feel like the best chef in New York. I will always remember our daily cigars, listening to Fats and Nellie Lutcher, the Wednesday concerts, oysters at Dock's, and your incredible patience. You were the greatest father-in-law on earth. Frank
