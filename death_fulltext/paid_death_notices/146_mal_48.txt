        KLEIN-Hazzan Louis. The Cantors Assembly records with sorrow the passing of a revered colleague of more than four decades. A graduate of the Conservatorium of Ospend Belgium, he studied Hazzanut with Hazzan B. Rabinowitz of Antwerp. He served as cantor in London, England, Brooklyn, N.Y. and Congregation B'naiMoshe of West Bloomfield, MI. We extend our sympathy to his children and his loved ones. May his memory abide as a blessing. Hazzan Henry Rosenblum, Pres. Hazzan Stephen J. Stein, Exec. VP Hazzan Abraham B. Shapiro, Exec. Administrator
