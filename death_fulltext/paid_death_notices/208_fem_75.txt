        SHACK--Essie. Was just shy of her 100th birthday. It was a good and long life, filled with love for her attentive and devoted son Donald, and her daughter-in-law Barbara. We shared wonderful times with Essie on New Year's Eve, summer weekends in Great Barrington, and quiet afternoons at home. She was strong and kind, with a great sense of humor, and very smart. We will all miss her very much. Our sincere condolences to the Shack family, Donald and Barbara, grandchildren David, Laura, and Laura, great-grandchildren Nicole, Joseph and Francesca.
