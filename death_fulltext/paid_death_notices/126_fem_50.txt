        LUNZER-Shoshana (Rose). We are heartbroken at the loss of our beloved sister, sister-in-law, and aunt, and mourn with Peter, her devoted husband, and adoring children, Ben, Jay, Francesca and David and their families. Shoshana strove throughout her life to fulfill the ideals of learning, piety, Tzedakah, and Chesed instilled by our late parents, Rabbi Benjamin and Helen Skidelsky. To Shoshana, Jewish living was truly an art. Her aesthetic sensibility, her love of literature and the arts, informed every aspect of her life. A superb mother, she was a hallowing influence, an enabler, who rejoiced in the many accomplishments of her cherished children and grandchildren. Her special reward was to see them perpetuate her values in their own homes and in the community. She was a woman of valor who demonstated extraordinary faith, courage, and dignity to the end of her life. Of her it may be said, ''She translated the poetry of moral aspiration into the prose of everyday life.''
