        RUBINSTEIN-Aniela (Nela). Died peacefully at her home in NY on December 31, aged 93. Our beloved mother will be missed by all of us; her children, Eva, Paul, Alina and John Rubinstein (Jane Lanier), her grandchildren Amy and David (Kristy Wiberg) Coffin, Jason (Amy Fransetic), Jessica, Michael, Peter and Jacob Rubinstein, and her great grandchildren, Alexander and Julian Coffin-Lennear and Linnea Coffin. She was born in Vilnius, Lithuania, the youngest child of Emil Mlynarski, composer, violinist, co-founder 1901 and first Conductor of the Warsaw Philharmonic, and later Director of the Warsaw Opera for 20 years. In her youth, she studied dance in Dresden with Mary Wigman. She was briefly married tothe pianist, Mieczyslaw Munz, who later taught at Juilliard. Her 50 year marriage to Arthur Rubinstein lasted until his death in 1982. They lived in Paris until the outbreak of WW II in 1939, when they were forced to leave, later joining the emigre artistic community in Hollywood. They became US citizens in 1946. After 1954 they reclaimed their house in Paris, and also maintained homes in New York and Spain. Our mother was known for her wonderful cooking, her memorable parties, her great charm, her elegance and beauty. She spoke seven languages, was immensely musical, sculpted, painted, and even embroidered with talent. She was a co-founder of the annual Polonaise Ball and played a major role in making it a highly successful event for the benefit of Polish Assistance, Inc. In 1983, Alfred A. Knopf published ''Nela's Cookbook,'' to the delight of her family and friends. It was later translated into Polish. We loved our sweet Ma, and we will deeply miss her spontaneity, her enthusiasm, her generosity, and her quirky humor. A celebration of her life will be planned for a later date.
