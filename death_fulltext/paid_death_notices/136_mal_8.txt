        SAMPSON-Harvey E. Cornell University mourns the loss of Trustee Emeritus and Presidential Councillor, Harvey E. Sampson, a member of the Class of '51, served the University in numerous capacities; as trustee for nineteen years, life member and chair of the University Council, chair of the Cornell Medical College Board of Overseers and of the New York Hospital-Cornell Joint Board and foremost benefactor to the University. He was a member of the nationally ranked football teams of 1948, 1949, and 1950, receiving United Press All-East honorable mention as an end in 1950. He served in the U.S. Army as a first lieutenant in the Korean conflict. A visionary entrepreneur & pioneer in the marketing and distribution of high technology electronic equipment and components to the broadcast industry, he placed his vast skills and knowledge at the service of Cornell and in support of interests as diverse as athletics, ornithology, medicine, art, and music. He served the larger community as director of the Cayuga Medical Center, and the Boyce Thompson Institute, director of Weiss, Peck and Greer Mutual Funds, and governor of the Audio Engineering Society. He was revered for his devotion, for his unflagging enthusiasm and keen insight, and for his good counsel. His charm, grace, intellect, and wit endeared him to all who knew him and made him an extraordinarily effective advocate for Cornell. We share with his wife, Carolyn, and their six children, a profound sense of loss at the passing of one of Cornell's most honored and respected alumni. He will be greatly missed. A memorial service will be held May 11 at 4 P.M. in Sage chapel on the Cornell University campus, Ithaca, New York. Harold Tanner, Chairman Cornell University Bd of Trustees Hunter R. Rawlings, III President, Cornell University
