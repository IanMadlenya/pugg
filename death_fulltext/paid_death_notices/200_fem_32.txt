        CHALEK--Doris, 78, was felled by a cerebral hemorrhage Wednesday afternoon, September 3, and passed away some hours later with her beloved husband Mort at her bedside along with several other family members. Longtime residents of New Rochelle, the Chalek's were to have celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary next month. Doris served for 32 years as a volunteer in the therapeutic nursery program of the Guidance Center, a health and human services organization serving Westchester County. They were inveterate world travelers and when any friend or relative was contemplating a trip abroad, Doris could be counted upon to whip out the spiral notebook in which she had logged the interesting sites, restaurants and comfortable hotels in the appropriate part of the world. In addition to her husband Mort, Doris is survived by two daughters, Sonna Schupak and Robin Tzannes, and son Mitchel Chalek. There are seven grandchildren as well as a first great-grandchild who was born this summer. Also surviving is Doris' brother, Henry Wittenberg, a U.S. wrestling champion who won a gold medal in the 1948 Olympics. Friends and relatives will gather informally Sunday afternoon, September 7, at the Chalek residence in New Rochelle.
