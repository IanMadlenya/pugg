        GUTTENBERG--Adele. The Board of Directors and staff of the JCC on the Palisades are greatly saddened by the passing of Adele Guttenberg, a beloved friend and supporter, who was devoted to helping those faced with physical challenges. Adele and her husband Bill established the Chuck Guttenberg Center for the Physically Challenged at the JCC, which provides invaluable programs and services for the entire community. Kind and generous, Adele always provided for the less fortunate and those in need. Our deepest condolences go to her dear husband Bill and the extended family. May her memory be for a blessing. Daniel Rubin, President Avi A. Lewinson, Exec. Dir.
