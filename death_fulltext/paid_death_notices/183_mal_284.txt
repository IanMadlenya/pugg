        PHIPPS-Ogden. The New York Thoroughbred Horsemen's Association (NYTHA) express our deepest sympathy to the family of Ogden Phipps. The distinguished former Chairman of the Jockey Club will be sorely missed. He set unique guidelines for thoroughbred horseracing and became the preeminent figure in New York's thoroughbred racing. Mr. Phipps set the example for all of us to follow...his demeanor, his success and his love of the sport. We'll all miss him, the owners both big and small, and the trainers. The world has lost a gracious, accomplished individual and a true sportsman. Richard Bomze, President and the NYTHA Board
