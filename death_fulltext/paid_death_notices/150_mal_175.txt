        GOLDWAG-Elias. The administration and staff of Beth Israel Medical Center are deeply saddened over the death of our dear friend and devoted volunteer, Ely Goldwag. Ely was a great spirit who was devoted to Beth Israel Medical Center Singer Division. His constant smile was a comfort to the countless patients he visited, and a delight to the many members of the staff he befriended during his many years of volunteer activity. He was a special man who is missed. Our hearfelt condolences are extended to his wife, Shirley, and all who loved him. Matthew E. Fink, MD, President Gail F.
