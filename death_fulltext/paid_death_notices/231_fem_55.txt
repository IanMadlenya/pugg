        SOHMER--Millie (nee Braunstein), widow of Dr. Abram Sohmer of Jamaica, N.Y. died April 6, 2006 in Los Angeles. She was 90 years of age. An immigrant girl who lived an American dream, Millie and her parents arrived from England penniless. Hardworking and industrious, Millie determined to educate herself. After high school, she attended college and nursing schooland became a graduate Registered Nurse. She was Chief Obstetrical Nurse and Night Supervisor at Beth Israel Hospital where she met and fell in love with a dashing, young intern named Abram Sohmer. They married in 1940. A first child, Stephen, was born in December 1941. Abram was then a flight surgeon with the USAF. When he volunteered for overseas duty, Millie and her son moved to New York, where they lived for the duration of the war with Abram's parents, David and Rose Sohmer. Abram rose to the rank of Colonel and was awarded a Bronze Star medal. After the war, the couple settled in Jamaica, where a second son, Paul, was born in 1948. Abram practiced family medicine for more than 50 years. In addition to raising her sons, Millie worked sideby-side with her husband during many of those years. They were loved and respected by the community they cared for. A happy and contented couple, they traveled widely and enjoyed theatre, music, and books. They were married 63 years. Millie is survived by her sons, six grandchildren and a loving extended family. Each year an endowment in Millie's honor at Beth Israel School of Nursing provides scholarships for two immigrant students. Condolences and reminiscences welcome at drsohmer@aol.com.
