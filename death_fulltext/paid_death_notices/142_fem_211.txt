        LEWIS-Mary, 81, died peacefully and without pain at home Monday evening, November 23rd, lovingly surrounded by her family and close friends. Mary's lifetime dedication to help make the world a better, healthier and safer place for children and other living things enabled her to do extraordinary work as a nurse (psychiatric, training, teaching) at Mt. Sinai Hospital, Hillside Hospital and International House. She also helped to develop nursing communities in countries as far afield as Afghanistan and Honduras under the auspices of CARE/MEDICO. Not least of her accomplishments was as Director of Mohegan Colony Day Camp where she influenced the lives of hundreds of young people. She was mentor, guru, role model, advisor and crone to so many of us. And to the privileged few, she was mother, grandmother, mother-inlaw, grandmother-in-law, newly blessed great grandmother, cousin, sister-in-law, aunt, great aunt, best friend and lots more. On Saturday, November 28, at 12:30PM, there will be a memorial celebration of Mary's life at the International House, 500 Riverside Drive, one block north of 122 Street.
