        ARNOLD-Mildred. Of Westport, CT on December 14, 1997. In loving memory. Beloved wife of Norman for 56 years. Cherished mother of Charles, Susan and Phyllis. Adored gramma to Joshua, Mason and Isabelle. Mildred had an extraordinary approach to life that she carried to an honorable and dignified death. Her unique take on the world allowed her to endure the unbearable, to cut to the heart of things and to profoundly touch in an individual and special way everyone who knew her. We will miss you forever. Donations in lieu of flowers to YAI Institute for People with Disabilities, 460 West 34th Street, NYC 10001-2382.
