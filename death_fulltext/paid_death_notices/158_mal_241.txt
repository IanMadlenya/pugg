        KOWAL-John. Manhattan Community Board Seven mourns the passing of our friend and leader, who was a member of the Board for over 20 years, serving as Chairperson, Vice Chairperson and Chair of many committees. John loved the Upper West Side, fought passionately for a democratic and equitable community process, and worked tirelessly for decent, affordable housing for the homeless and for low-income residents. He was one of the major community architects of the West Side Urban Renewal Area Plan, a builder and advocate for SRO housing, and the conscience of the Community Board to work for all our neighbors who need a helping hand. Always courteous and charming, reasonable and practical, he never lost his indignation at injustice and always kept up the good fight to make the world a better place.
        KOWAL-John. We mourn the loss of a good and special friend, a true advocate for those in need, a builder of our community and a wonderful guy. Ethel and Isaiah Sheffer
