        KENNEDY-John F. Jr. All persons living with disability and those who have worked to extend the opportunities of everyday life for those with disabilities mourn the passing of John F. Kennedy Jr. With Reaching Up, John demonstrated and used his leadership and commitment to advance the careers of countless workers and established a national model. His deep concern and compassion for persons with mental retardation, and for those with chronic illnesses who need the help of a caring society has lost a spirited voice and a true champion. Our hearts go out to his family and to the family of Caroline Bessette Kennedy and Lauren Bessette, who have suffered such a tremendous personal loss. Arthur Y. Webb, President and Chief Executive Officer Village Care of New York
        KENNEDY-John F. Jr. The Baruch College community wishes to express its profound sympathy to the Kennedy and Bessette families on the death of three inspiring and selfless young people, John F. Kennedy Jr., Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and Lauren Bessette. Mr. Kennedy's largely unsung generosity in creating the Kennedy Fellows Program within the City University was testimony to his commitment to providing quality education to the professionals working with individuals with disabilities. His potential for making America a better place was boundless. His compassion, intelligence and graciousness will long be remembered. Lois S. Cronholm Interim President Baruch College The City University of New York
