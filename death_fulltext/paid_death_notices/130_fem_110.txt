        FLINT-Selma. On November 15, 1997, age 96 and yet still young. Beloved wife of Sam for over half a century. Dearly loved and deeply loving mother of Carol and Philip. Selma gave so much to so many, and yet in the end her greatest gift was to teach us about the true meaning of a life well lived. Selma love abundantly, gave unselfishly and deeply cherished friends, family and life itself. Mother-in-law to Mike, loving grandmother and friend to Andy, Peter, Kathryn, Jimmy, Clare, Barbara, Roy and Ramon, and the adoring and loving great grandmother of Adam. We will miss her deeply and treasure her memory and friendship throughout our lives.
