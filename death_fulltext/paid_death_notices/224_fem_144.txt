        WISELY--Sister Bernadette de Lourdes, O. Carm. (''Mother Bernadette''). The Board of Directors, staff, volunteers and supporters of the Catholic Health Care System of the Archdiocese of New York (CHCS) mourn the death of Mother Bernadette, who inspired the Carmelite Sisters of the Aged and Infirm with her charismatic leadership. Mother Bernadette's pioneering concepts of care for the elderly guide the management of the System's three facilities overseen by the Carmelite Sisters: Mary Manning Walsh Home, Manhattan; Carmel Richmond Healthcare & Rehabilitation Center, Staten Island; and Ferncliff Nursing Home, Rhinebeck. Her development of the ''resident-centered care'' model continues as inspiration for the management of the System's four additional facilities: Kateri Residence and Terence Cardinal Cooke Health Care Center, Manhattan; St. Vincent de Paul Residence, Bronx; and St. Teresa's Nursing Home, Middletown. Mother Bernadette's legacy can be witnessed every day in the System's holistic approach to care, and her dynamic vision will continue to inspire the pacesetters of eldercare philosophy. Karl P. Adler, M.D., Chairman
