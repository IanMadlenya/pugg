        SVIRIDOFF-Mitchell. It is with deepest sorrow that the Local Initiatives Support Corporation mourns the passing of its founder Mitchell Sviridoff. Like thousands of community development corporations from coast to coast, LISC owes much of its growth and success, and in our case our very existence, to Mike Sviridoff's vision, energy, and wisdom. Mike has been a source of inspiration and confidence to people and organizations across America who often had no other champions, no material wealth, and little political influence. With his encouragement and example, they have transformed poor neighborhoods and rural communities against overwhelming odds. Mike has been the visionary, conscience, mentor, and teacher to three generations of grassroots entrepreneurs. His leadership is irreplaceable, but his example will remain a national treasure.
