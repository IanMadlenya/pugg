        FEIGELSON-Charles I., M.D. The members of The New York Psychoanalytic Institute and Society mourn the loss of their esteemed colleague, Dr. Charles I. Feigelson. Dr. Feigelson was a remarkable educator and a profound influence on his colleagues. As a Training and Supervising Analyst, he contributed immeasurably to the education of generations of students of psychoanalysis. We all feel a sense of infinite loss of this valued teacher and loyal and courageous person. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife Carolyn, brother Eugene Feigelson, M.D., children Jeremy, Daniel, Tom, Paul and Suzanne. Philip Herschenfeld, M.D., Pres., N.Y.
