        MOREAU-Antoine Claude, M.D. It is with profound sorrow and a deep sense of regret that we, the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center family and the Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology mourn the loss of our esteemed and respected staff member, Dr. Antoine Claude Moreau. He was an outstanding clinician and gifted surgeon who devoted his time to patient care as well as to medical student and resident training. Dr. Moreau was a Diplomate of the American Board of Obstetrics & Gynecology; a Fellow of the American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists; Vice President of the Bronx OB/GYN Society; and Chief of Gynecology and Director of Student Teaching at Bronx-Lebanon. His everpresent broad smile, effusive warmth and the exuberance he manifested will certainly be missed. Our heartfelt sympathy is extended to his wife Eunide and children, Claudine and Martine. Milton Gumbs, M.D. VP/Medical Dir. Magdy Mikhail, M.D. Professor and Chairman Department of OB/GYN
