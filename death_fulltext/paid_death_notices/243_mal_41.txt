        BLATTNER--Alvin Robert ''Bob'', died peacefully on March 30, 2007, at age 84. Bob was born in Cairo, Egypt, son of Robert and Marguerite Blattner (nee Bialobos). His dry humor, sharp observational powers, and unique sense of satire and wit made him a self appointed commentator on the human condition. Surviving are his children, Dr. Stephen Blattner of Cape Elizabeth, ME and Marguerite Blattner of San Diego, CA, his grandchildren Zachary Blattner and Arielle Blattner, and his daughter-in-law Dr. Francine Blattner. Burial at Mt. Hope Cemetery, Saw Mill River Road, Hastings, at 3 PM, April 6. Donations may be made to: Maine Veterans Home, 290 US Route 1, Scarborough, ME 04074.
