        KASOWITZ--Felice. The 92nd Street Y Board and staff mourn the passing of Felice Kasowitz, mother of Marc and mother-in-law of our Board member, Lori. The Y community has been particularly blessed by the involvement of the Kasowitz family. Felice, an ardent patron of the entire Y, also focused her energy on supporting the Y's Makor/Steinhardt Center, cochairing one of the center's main fundraising events. Felice's spirit and values will be kept alive at the Y for generations to come. We extend our deepest sympathies to Marc, Lori, their daughter Samantha and the entire Kasowitz family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Michael Goldstein, President Matthew Bronfman, Chairman Sol Adler, Executive Director
