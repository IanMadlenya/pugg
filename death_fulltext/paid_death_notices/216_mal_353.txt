        WRISTON--Walter. Walter was known to many as a brilliant and innovative banker, statesman, author and philanthropist, but to us, he was first and foremost a devoted and loving father, father-in-law & grandfather. His intellectual curiosity, marvelous humor, kindness, unfailing support and moral compass will continue to inspire and guide us always. Cassy, Dick, Christopher and Katy Quintal
