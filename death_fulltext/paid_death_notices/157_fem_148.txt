        RUBENSTEIN - Beatrice. The trustees and staff of the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services mourn the passing of Beatrice Rubenstein, a volunteer for JBFCS's Family Court program and a member of our Geller House Divisional Committee for more than 25 years. In both roles, Mrs. Rubenstein worked tirelessly on behalf of troubled children and demonstrated a unique commitment to those in need. We express our deepest sympathy to her husband, Sol; her three children; her eight grandchildren; her sister; and other members of her family. Joseph S. Kaplan, President Seymour R. Askin, Jr., Chairman of the Board Barbara Peck, Chairwoman, Geller House Divisional Cmte. Alan B.
