        MILHORAT-Ade T. M.D. We deeply mourn the passing of our longtime friend, whose pioneering research conducted at New York Hospital in the 1940s and great concern for the patients he served sparked the creation of MDA, the world's foremost agency dedicated to the defeat of neuromuscular diseases. He guided development of MDA's research program for more than two decades. His scientific acumen made possible many significant achievements that have brought us to the treshold of delivering treatments and cures for a host of diseases, many of them catastrophic. With profound admiration and gratitude for Dr. Milhorat's unparalleled contributions to MDA's lifesaving mission, our heartfelt condolences go to his two sons, daughter, and their families.
