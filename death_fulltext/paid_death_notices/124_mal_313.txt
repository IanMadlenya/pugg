        WERLE-Frederick C. Mannes College of Music notes with deep regret the passing on May 15, 1997 of Frederick C. Werle, a pupil of Robert Casadesus and Nadia Boulanger who fulfilled many administrative positions at Mannes between 1953 and 1976 and taught there over an even longer period of time. His presence will be missed.
