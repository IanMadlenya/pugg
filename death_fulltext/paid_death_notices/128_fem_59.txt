        MARGOLIS-Laura. The Officers, Board and Staff of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JdC), deeply mourn the passing of one of the outstanding figures in JDC history, who was involved in the rescue and relief of thousands of Jews fleeing Nazi persecution. A true Woman of Valor, she directed JDC's humanitarian programs in Cuba, Shanghai, Portugal, Spain & Sweden before and during W.W. II. Her courage, daring and resourcefulness made her a legend. Afterwards, she directed JDC Services in France, later settling in Israel and helping forge JDC's Malben Homes For The Aged, into a model of services for the elderly. A giant has passed on. Funeral sevices were private. We express our condolences to her nephews: Donald l. Margolis of Teaneck, NJ and James A. Margolis of Brookline, Massachusetts. Jonathan W. Kolker, President Milton A. Wolf, Chairman Michael Schneider, Executive VP Ralph I. Goldman, Hon. Exec VP
