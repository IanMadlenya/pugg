        MERRILL-Bob. I am deeply saddened by the loss of my colleague, collaborator and friendone of the last quality writers whose work was at home on both the Hit Parade and the musical stage as we once knew them. Successes or not, whether ''Carnival,'' ''Take Me Along,'' ''Sugar,'' or ''Breakfast at Tiffany's,'' the shows we created are experiences I cherish. I will always appreciate his contribution to ''Hello, Dolly!'' His talent, integrity and compassion defined his ability to write music and lyrics that made people want to believe that ''Love Makes the World Go Round.'' David Merrick
