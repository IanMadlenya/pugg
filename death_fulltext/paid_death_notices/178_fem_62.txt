        EFROS-Judith (Judy) B. (nee Breitman). Beloved, darling wife and best friend of Edwin Efros. Loving, caring mother of Ellen Anne Efros-Kahn and Paul Steven Efros. She fought a long and heroic battle against disease. She had been a fine pianist, and almost to the end, was an avid gardener whose works were a delight to the eye. Judy loved to travel and had exceptional ability to make friends everywhere. She had a great flair for interior design and apparel but never was ostentatious. A graduate of New York University and recipient of a Master's Degree from C.W. Post College, she volunteered professional family counseling services to Nassau County and New York State agencies, in particular those overseeing the operation of nursing homes. There will be a memorial service on Sunday, November 18, 2001 at 12:30PM at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street. No flowers please. Instead, a gift to your favorite charity or to the Jewish Guild for the Blind, 15 West 65th Street, New York, New York 10023, in her memory, will be deeply appreciated.
        EFROS-Judy. Fairwell my love, my best friend, my companion of more than 54 years. I will remember you always. Edwin
