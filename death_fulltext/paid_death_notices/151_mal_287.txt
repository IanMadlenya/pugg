        MARK-Hyman. Beloved husband and devoted companion of Emma, beloved brother of Nathan (Blanche) and the late Julius and Dorothy.
        MARK-Hyman. AMIT is deeply grieved by the passing of our most dedicated pro-bono Trust and Estates attorney, and beloved husband of our indefatigable Honorary Planned Giving chairwoman, Emma Mark. A man of great integrity, wisdom and compassion, Hy Mark lived a life devoted to Torah, Israel and the Jewish community. He was the consummate volunteer who for decades contributed his legal expertise for the furtherance of AMIT's mission to ''save the Forgotten Children of Israel.'' May his devoted and beloved wife, Emma, be comforted among the Mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Evelyn Blachor, Nat'l President Marvin Leff, Executive Director
