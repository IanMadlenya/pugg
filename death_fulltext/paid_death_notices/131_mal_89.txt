        BECKERMAN-Sam, beloved husband of Eszter Gyory, past president of Young Men's Philanthropic League NYC, Chairman Emeritus of Designcraft Industries, Inc. has departed on December 1, 1997. His generous charitable and philanthropic endeavors had touched the hearts of those he had known personally, as well as those whom he did not know. All of them have benefited from his generous giving and care. He created Designcraft Industries in the early sixties. Through acquisitions and internal growth, Designcraft had emerged as the leading precious metal jewelry manufacturing company of the eighties. Under his guidance, Designcraft successfully completed the public offering of its shares, culminating in the listing on the American Stock Exchange. He is survived by his wife Eszter, his two sons Larry and Daniel and his daughter Ann, his brother Sidney and his sisters Zelda, Sharon, Adele and Ethel and two grandchildren. The Memorial Service will be held on December 11th at Gyory Art Studio, 40 NE 40th Street Miami Art and Design District 5-7 PM, Telephone: 305575-6587.
