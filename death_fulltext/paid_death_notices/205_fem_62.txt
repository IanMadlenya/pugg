She was the beloved mother of Susan Yard Harris of Northampton, MA, Peter Yard Harris of New York City, and Richard Yard Harris of Woodland Park, CO. She is also survived by her sister Molly Yard, who was the President of the National Organization for Women (NOW), and four grandchildren: Darcy, Brian, Zachary, and Risa. Florence concentrated her life on family care, and her deep commitment to matters of racial injustice and helping those who can least fend for themselves. Louis Harris has long claimed that Florence was his ''moral compass.'' Her fierce sense of moral indignation and personal honesty left its mark on all who knew her well.
