        REBELL--Adele S., 62, surrounded by her family, passed away on August 23, 2005. Her will to live could not defeat MDS. Her zest for life was incredible. A true leader, amongst her friends and family, she served as president of Temple Israel in Ridgewood NJ, Hadassah and the Women's NJ Bar Association. Her passion for interesting travel and the resulting journals are legendary. An avid theater-museum goer, as well as bridge/golf/skier, and event planner, she packed in two lives full of accomplishments. Always charitable, her legal career was dedicated to helping those less fortunate. A remarkable mother to Barbara, Deborah and Jon, and wife to Arthur, she will be sorely missed.
