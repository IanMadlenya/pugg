        HEILBRUN -- Carolyn. The Women Writing Women's Lives seminar of biographers and memoirists will sadly miss our co-founder, Carolyn Heilbrun. Her inspiring writing about women's lives has helped reshape our work. Her example as a woman of courage will continue to influence us. We extend our sympathies to her family and all who knew and loved her. Kathy Chamberlain, Chair of the Steering Committee of W.W.W.L.
