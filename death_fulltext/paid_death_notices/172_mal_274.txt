        FOX-George A. The Board of Trustees, President and staff of WNYC Radio wish to convey their deepest condolences to the family of George A. Fox, who served as Chairman of the WNYC Foundation from 1982-84. During a critical time in WNYC's history, he oversaw the comprehensive rehabilitation of the stations' broadcast facilities. His leadership, guidance and vision for WNYC and his ongoing support of the station's Independence Campaign were invaluable. He will be greatly missed.
