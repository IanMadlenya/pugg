        LEVINE-Laurence W. The directors and staff of the Davis Mutual Funds mourn the sudden and untimely passing of their dear friend and esteemed director for 32 years. He had a distinguished career as a lawyer and diplomat. He was also a wise, and generous of time, counselor to us, our many thousands of shareholders, and our employees, and we shall miss him dearly. Our deepest condolences to his family.
        LEVINE-Laurence W. He had a big heart that failed him, but his good deeds live on. When it came to niceness and warmth and brains and humor and an unobtrusive giving hand he excelled. He also was born on April 9th, the birthday of that other great American. Rest in peace, we will all miss you. Alvin L. Levine
