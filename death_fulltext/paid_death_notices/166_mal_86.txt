        MAYEN-Paul. Died on November 3, 2000. Noted Architect and Industrial designer, founder of Habitat, Intrex and Architectural Supplements, Inc. Designer of the Visitor's Center at Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater. Many of his works are in the permanent collection at the Museum of Modern Art. A passionate gardener, he was as witty in his designs as he was in conversation, and as an art collector, he was both avid and adroit. At ease in all situations, social and intellectual, he was as widely loved for his humor and rousing spirit, as for his compasssion and humanity. No funeral is planned, but a celebration of his life will be held in his New York gardens in the spring. Contributions in Paul's memory may be made to Western Pennsylvania Conservancy for Fallingwater, Box R, Route 381 South, Mill Run, PA. 15464.
