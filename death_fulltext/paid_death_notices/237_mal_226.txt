        BARASCH--Kenneth. After a short battle with cancer, Kenneth is survived by his sons Matthew and Douglas and his daughter Stacey and by his grandchildren Naomi and Malcolm. Ken lived life to the fullest and his wit and charm will be missed by all who came to know him. Ken will be laid to rest on Tuesday at Sharon Gardens, Valhalla, New York.
