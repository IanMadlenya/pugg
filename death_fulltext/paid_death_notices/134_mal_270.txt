        SMERLING-Rabbi Samuel. We record with sorrow the passing of our beloved colleague. Ordained in 1949, he served as a chaplain in the United States Army after which he served pulpits in New Jersey and New York, most recently the Rosedale Jewish Center (NY). We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Pearl, and children Arthur, Reva, and all who were touched through his rabbinate. Rabbi Seymour L. Essrog, Pres. Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Exec. VP The Rabbinical Assembly
