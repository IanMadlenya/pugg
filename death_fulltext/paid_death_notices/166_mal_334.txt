        PALITZ-Clarence Yale, Jr. It is with great sadness that the Board of Directors and staff of Career Transition For Dancers acknowledges the untimely passing of Clarence Palitz, husband of our fellow Board member and dear friend, Anka Palitz. ''Cal'' was an important and generous supporter of our work. We extend our deepest sympathies to his family, friends, and colleagues.
