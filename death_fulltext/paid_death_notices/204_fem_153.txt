Born in Edinburgh, Scotland on May 12, 1944, Norma died at her home in Santa Monica, CA. on January 12, 2004 surrounded by family and friends, after a heroic 12-year struggle with breast cancer. She graduated from Edinburgh University in 1969 with a Ph.D. in biochemistry. In 1968, she married Fraser Stoddart, currently professor of chemistry and Director of the California NanoSystems Institute at UCLA. Following post doctoral research in endocrinology at Queen's University in Canada and at Sheffield University in England, she devoted the next ten years to raising their two daughters. She then returned to academic life in support of the research efforts of her husband in chemistry at the Universities of Sheffield, Birmingham, and California, Los Angeles. Norma will be remembered for her down-toearth common sense, dry wit, and generosity of spirit. Donations may be send to the Norma Stoddart Prize for Academic Excellence and Outstanding Citizenship open to research students and fellows in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at UCLA.
