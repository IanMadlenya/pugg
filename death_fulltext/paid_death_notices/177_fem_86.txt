        GINN-Irene. Irene passed away, peacefully, October 10, at Arbor Hospice, Ann Arbor, Michigan, surrounded by her family. Burial services will be private. Irene ''Gave it the good fight''. She was my companion-beautiful, kind, considerate and loving-a constant joy. She loved life, and gave that love to so many. The Finkelstein family shares in expressing their great sorrow.
