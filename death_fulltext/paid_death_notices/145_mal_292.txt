        ST.CLAIR-Michael. Died February 22, 1999 at age 86. Michael St.Clair was a blue-eyed sweetheart. He was also a knowledgeable art dealer and an authority on Marsden Hartley. He was a capital ''D'' down-the-line non-swerving Democrat who would have voted for the Devil had that little man run on the ticket. He was a lover of his Fire Island Pines beach house where, on bright summer days, he would mix the best Negronis this side of Venice. He was a good friend to many and my best one for over 53 years. Ave Atque Vale. Paul M. Jones
        ST. CLAIR-Michael. The members of the Art Dealers Association of America mourn the passing of their distinguished colleague, an ADAA member since its inception in 1962. As director of the Babcock Galleries, he championed American art, particularly the works of Hartley, Hassam, Maurer and Kensett. A gentleman of unfailing courtesy and a distinguished scholar, he made an important contribution to the art community. Our sympathy and condolences are extended to his friend, Paul M. Jones.
