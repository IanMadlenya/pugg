        BULLEN--Richard H., on July 18, 2005, of congestive heart failure, having wondrously and with singular grace survived several years of failing health. Beloved and loving husband of Anne Marie; devoted father of Richard and Thomas; grandfather of Valerie, Georgia, Juliana and Richard. Born May 9, 1919, in Logan, Utah, son of Vivian and Asa Bullen. Dick Bullen graduated from Utah State University 1939, received an MBA from Harvard Business School, and served in the U.S. Army as a Lieutenant in the Quartermaster Corps in WWII. He enjoyed a long and successful career with IBM, joining the company as a salesman in 1945 and leaving 27 years later as Senior Vice President. He later served for many years on the boards of the Upjohn Company and Alaska Interstate and was a trustee of Lenox Hill Hospital. Dick Bullen was typical of men from an era often referred to as ''The Greatest Generation'' and exhibited their characteristic qualities of integrity, courage, optimism, and generosity. He was modest about his successes and never embittered by his setbacks. He will be profoundly missed by his many friends and loving family. A memorial service will be held on Monday August 22 1PM at Holy Trinity Church, 316 E. 88th St., (212) 289-4100. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Waterford School, 1480 East 9400 South, Sandy, UT. 84093.
