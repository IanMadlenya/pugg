        STEINGLASS-Meyer. The Officers and Staff of State of Israel Bonds mourn the passing of Meyer Steinglass, National Publicity Director from the program's inception in 1951 until 1978. A master in the art of communications, he created a magnificent campaign that defined Israel's economy needs clearly and persuasively and inspired a worldwide audience to invest in her growth and development. The legacy of his labors is a thriving nation that has benefitted from the purchase of $17 billion in State of Israel securities. We extend our heartfelt condolences to the entire family. Gideon Patt, President
