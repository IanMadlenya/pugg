        NAVIN-John J., Jr. The New York Law School community is saddened by the death of John J. Navin, Jr., a member of its Board of Trustees from 1975-1994. Mr. Navin was a wonderful ally of the school during times of great challenges. He was an early supporter of the Second Century Campaign and helped set the pace for others. We will miss his leadership and his friendship. Our condolences to his wife Joan and his children John, III, Cara Moxley and Stacey NavinWeinstein.
