        LOWE--Ruth D., 81. Passed away March 14 after a brief illness. The brevity of her passing contrasted with her long, vibrant family and social life. Daughter of Dr. Wheeler and Laura Davey, she grew up in State College, PA. After graduating Penn State University, she came to New York to sing professionally in well-known 1940's big bands under the name of ''Betty Barton.'' In 1949, she married Monroe W. Greenthal, founder of the Monroe W. Greenthal Co. advertising agency in New York City, with whom she had four children. Widowed in 1963, she married again in 1973 to Harry K. Lowe, chairman of Prospect Press. Her loved ones will deeply miss her unquenchable interest in everything New York, sparkling wit, sharp intellect, and most of all, the sound of her voice, for she lived her life as one great song. She is survived by her children, Stanley, William, David and Paula Greenthal; Mr. Lowe's daughter Michaella Balaban; six grandchildren; two nieces and their children. Funeral Services will be private.
