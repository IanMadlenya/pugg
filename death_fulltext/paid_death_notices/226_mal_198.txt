        GIBSON--Joshua, M.D. Members of the Division of Infectious Diseases and the Samuel Bronfman Department of Medicine at The Mount Sinai School of Medicine mourn the sudden death of their beloved colleague and friend, Joshua Gibson. He was also a son, a brother, a husband and a member of the Mount Sinai family. Prior to entering the Infectious Diseases Fellowship, Joshua completed his internal medicine training at Mount Sinai Hospital, obtained his medical degree from Yale University School of Medicine and his undergraduate degree from Bowdoin College. Joshua was a wonderful and compassionate physician and a tireless patient advocate. In addition to his numerous local as well as international efforts on behalf of those in need, he cofounded the Advancing Idealism in Medicine Curriculum at Mount Sinai to facilitate medical resident involvement in programs worldwide focussed on improving the plight of others. Although he will be sorely missed his legacy will continue through the continued good works of the Mount Sinai trainees. Mary E. Klotman, M.D. Chief, Division of Infectious Diseases, Mount Sinai School of Medicine
