        McCRAY-Porter. The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art and members of its International Council are deeply saddened by the passing of Porter McCray, at age 92, founding director of the Museum's International Program and an honorary member of the International Council. During Porter's distinguished career, he was the Museum's director of circulating exhibitions in the United States from 1947-50 and director of circulating exhibitions for both international and domestic programs from 1952-61. He became director of the JDR 3rd Fund, where he remained until his retirement in 1975. Porter's contributions to the field of international culture and exchange were legendary and strongly felt throughout the world. His numerous involvements included such organizations as the Japan Society, the Asian Cultural Council, the Byrd Hoffman Foundation, the Archives of American Art, the International Council of Museums, Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Museum of African Art in Washington D.C., and the U.S. Department of State, all of which were deeply affected by his abiding commitment to them. We send our profound sympathy to his sister, Frances Jacob, and to his grandniece, Frances Blades. David Rockefeller, Chairman Emeritus Ronald S. Lauder, Chairman Agnes Gund, President Glenn D.
