        KLEIN-Michael L. The President, Chancellor Emeritus, Chairs of the Board of Governors and Boards of Overseers, administration, faculty, staff and students of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion record with profound sorrow the death of Dr. Michael L. Klein, Dean of the Jerusalem School, 1981-1998, and Effie Wise Ochs Professor of Biblical literature on Saturday, November 18th in Israel. Dr. Klein was a distinguished scholar, teacher and friend who touched the lives of countless students. He contributed to the growth and development of the Jerusalem Campus through his tenacity and determination. That same tenacity helped him through these last few years of his serious illness. Funeral services were held at Kibbutz Givat HaShlosha in Israel on Monday, November 20th. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife Shoshie, their children Mattan, Elad, Rachel and Ruth and the entire family. May they find comfort together with all those who mourn for Zion and Jerusalem. Rabbi Sheldon Zimmerman, Pres. Dr. Alfred Gottschalk, Chancellor Emeritus Mr. Burton Lehman, Chair, Board of Governors
