        MAY--Andrew Jeffrey. The Board of Trustees, management and staff of the Jewish Home & Hospital extends its deepest sympathies to longtime trustee, Harold May, and his wife, Millicent; daughter, Clarice, and the entire family on the passing of their beloved son, Andrew. Harold has been a valued trustee of the Jewish Home for 19 years and serves on the Bronx Division's Regional Board. He is a strong, generous supporter of Kittay House, the System's housing for independent seniors, where he has endowed the Harold and Millicent May Solarium, as well as other rooms for recreation and socialization. These spaces have brought much pleasure to Kittay's residents and has certainly enhanced their quality of living. We are grateful to Harold and Millie for their many contributions to the Lifecare System and are privileged to have Harold as a friend and trustee. Our thoughts will be with them in their time of loss. Fred M. Lowenfels Chairman Jewish Home & Hospital System Board David Haas, Chairman Jewish Home & Hospital Bronx Regional Board
