        TOKIEDA--Margaret Quigley (Peggy). We deeply mourn her sudden death on March 21, 2005. Peggy was beloved by her children, Kathryn J. and Charles P., and by her late husband George. Family and friends relished her humor and wit. Her strength and determination were an inspiration to all who knew and loved her. Legions of school children benefited from her skill and sense of fun, in her years of teaching at Packer Collegiate Institute, Trinity School and Allen Stevenson. Her love of her students and dedication to her profession were second only to her absolute devotion to her family. Her passing leaves us with a deep sense of void. A private memorial service will be held in her honor. Contributions may be made to Westtown Friends School, PA, or to Friends Seminary, Manhattan.
