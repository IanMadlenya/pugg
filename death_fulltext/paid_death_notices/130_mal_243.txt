        GRUNBERG-Paul, 72. November 8 at St. Peter's Hospital in Albany, after a long illness. Born in Milan Italy, educated in Italy and France, came to New York at age fifteen. A graduate of the Columbia University School of Architecture, he maintained a private practice in Manhattan for twelve years prior to moving with his family to a Columbia county farm in 1965. In 1972, he earned a Master's Degree in Urban-Environmental Studies from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute while becoming increasingly involved in civic affairs. A former Democratic Committeeman, he was an active member of numerous boards including Columbia Memorial Hospital (Hudson), the Spencertown (NY) Academy and Columbia County Habitat for Humanity. He served for twenty years on the Chatham ZBA, for fifteen years as its chairman. Mr. Grunberg was a founder and director of Jackson Hewitt, Inc., the second largest tax preparation service in the nation. Personal interests included painting, writing and working his land in Chatham Center, where he designed and built passive solar studios for his wife and himself. The first solo exhibit of his paintings was held at the Spencertown Academy in 1992. His 1977 science fiction novel, ''Sociex'', was recently published. For the past several years, he maintained a studio in Chatham village, dining often at the nearby Blue Plate Restaurant, owned by his wife, debating the issues of the day with family and friends. Mr. Grunberg is survived by his wife of 37 years, Judith (Backer) Grunberg, four sons, John of West Orange, NJ, Daniel of Lexington, MA., David of Somerville, MA, and Noah of Boston, MA., and five grandchildren, as well as by a sister, Loti Gaffney of Pittsburgh. Donations in his memory can be made to the Spencertown Academy, Columbia County Habitat for Humanity or the Chatham Rescue Squad. A memorial celebration will be held next month.
