        HOBSON-Elizabeth S. Died on October 1 in San Diego, at ninety. Following WW II, she left Hungary to join her mother and brothers in America. Throughout life, she had a thirst for knowledge: reading voraciously, traveling extensively, studying until recently at the New School. She marveled at the world around her and observed the distinguishing details of a fine fabric, a well-stitched garment, a porcelain figurine. She's remembered lovingly by many friends, the families of nephew Gary Sternberg of Texas, cousin Ron Meisels of Montreal and niece Marika Gordon of Los Angeles. The family requests that contributions in her memory be made to the Arthritis Foundation.
