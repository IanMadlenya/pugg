        LIEBERMAN-Minnie. We mourn the loss of a dear friend, Minnie Lieberman. As a Founder of the Medical Center, together with her late husband Hyman, the Liebermans played a vital role in providing for the spiritual needs of our patients and staff through their naming of the Hospital's Bet Midrash in memory of their parents. May the warm memories of this special woman of valor bring solace to her brother Leon and the entire family. May they be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
