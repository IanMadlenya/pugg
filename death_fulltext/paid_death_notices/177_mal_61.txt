        SEIDER-Seymour. The Officers and Directors of S.E.R.V.E. The Handicapped sadly mourn the passing of our brilliant Treasurer. Seymour was our mentor, guiding light and dearest friend. We will always cherish his wisdom, his devotion to severely disabled hospitalized veterans, the handicapped in our community, and many others in need. Our love to his beloved Selma, a founder of S.E.R.V.E., and to his adored children and grandchildren. Doris M. Tipograph Mary Moshos Co-Presidents
