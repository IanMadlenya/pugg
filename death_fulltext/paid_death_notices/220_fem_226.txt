        LEOPOLD--Anne Helen (nee David). Born in Worms, Germany, died May 18, 2005, in New York City at 84. She worried for us all. She dared to show that she didn't have all the answers. She enjoyed simple pleasures. She always wanted to have been more. She was so much. We miss you, ''our tante''. Love, Marilyn and Bibi.
