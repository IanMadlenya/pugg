        HAMMERMAN-Fay. The Board of Trustees of BHSSC and all its members mourn the passing of Fay Hammerman, mother of our distinguished Board member, Stephen. Fay, along with her late husband, Dave, were founders of our agency. Their concern for developmentally disabled children and adults will be an everlasting legacy. We extend our sincere condolences to her children, Robert, Eleanor and Stephen, all her grandchildren and greatgrandchildren and to her entire family. Fay will truly be missed by all who had the pleasure of knowing her. Brooklyn Hebrew School for Special Children Rabbi Morris J. Block, Exec. Dir. Sondra L. Grunes, CEO Sam S. Fierstein, President Edmund DiGiacomo, Chairman
