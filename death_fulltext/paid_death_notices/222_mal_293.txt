        SCHONFELD -- Herbert. 75, died peacefully on July 26, 2005, after a life filled with joy and happiness. He was the beloved husband of Sue, and adored father to Steven, Robert, and Michael. As successful as he was in business (President of Generation Mills), so was he in life. He was a wonderful and loving husband (married for 49 years), and father. It was with the same qualities in business, and family life, as he was with his friends: honesty, integrity, witty, and generous. He will be greatly missed by many as he touched so many of us in his own special way. Funeral services will be held Thursday 1:45 P.M. at Gutterman's Chapel in Woodbury.
        SCHONFELD--Herbert. The Board of Governors and the members of Glen Oaks Club express our deepest sorrow at the passing of our esteemed member Herbert and extend our heartfelt sympathy to his wife Sue and his family. Board of Governors Alan Goldberg, President
