        THACHER--Barbara Auchincloss. The Board of Directors and the Staff of Leake and Watts Services, Inc. note with deep sadness the death of Barbara Auchincloss Thacher, a truly exceptional lady who honored Leake and Watts Services, Inc. as a past chair of our Board of Directors. During her more than 20 years as a Director, Mrs. Thacher demonstrated a keen interest in those issues relating to children and to their education. She recognized the importance of each individual's contributions to the betterment of society. We extend our warmest thoughts and prayers to her wonderful family. James J.
