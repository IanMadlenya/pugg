        KUHN--Robert C. With deep sorrow, Horace Mann School mourns the loss of Robert C. Kuhn '47, visionary business leader and stalwart and caring friend of this institution. His thoughtful involvement for over 50 years--as a committed alumnus, devoted parent, distinguished Trustee and beloved grandparent-provide a continuing source of inspiration. A member of the HM Tillinghast Society, his affection for Horace Mann and his generosity to the school are well remembered. His integrity, intelligence and warmth touched us all. He will be greatly missed. A loving father, he is survived by two sons, William '99 and Thomas '80, his grandchildren Nicholas '18, Rachel and Miles, his daughter-inlaw Stacy Kuhn and other devoted family members. To his family, his friends and all of his loved ones, we extend our heartfelt condolences. Dr. Thomas M. Kelly Head of School Robert J. Katz '65 Chair, Board of Trustees
