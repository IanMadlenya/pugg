        EMERSON--Gloria. In her own words ''an award winning journalist and author who wrote about the war in Vietnam.'' Friends will remember her September 29, from 6:00 to 8 P.M. in the Religious Society of Friends Meeting House, 15 Rutherford Place, Stuyvesant Square, with respect and affection but without flowers.
