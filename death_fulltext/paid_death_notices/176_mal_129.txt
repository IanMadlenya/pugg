        SPENCER-William I. The Board of Directors, Executive Director, staff, children and families of Berkshire Farm Center and Services for Youth express our deepest sorrow on the passing of William I. Spencer. He was a vital and generous member of our Board of Directors for 48 years. He held various positions including assistant treasurer from 1953 to 1954, treasurer until 1962, vice president until 1963, president until 1968 and has been honorary chairman of the Board for the past 27 years. Mr. Spencer's hard work and generous support of the Cottage Building Campaign in the late 1960's resulted in the naming of Spencer Cottage in his honor. Spencer Cottage is a living unit for boys located on the grounds of the Residential Center at Canaan, NY. In addition he was instrumental in bringing the Hess Automotive Facility, a vocational training program, to the Center. He worked tirelessly to ensure a stronger and brighter future for thousands of children and families in New York State. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Susan, and the entire family. Charles H. Mott, President, Board of Directors
