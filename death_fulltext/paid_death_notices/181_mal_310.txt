        FREED-Ronald. The Board of Trustees and staff of the Kurt Weill Foundation for Music mourn the loss of Ronald Freed, who died February 20, 2002. As President of European American Music, Weill's principal publisher, he contributed greatly to the revival of interest in Weill's music. Mr. Freed was a wise consultant and great friend to the Foundation, and he will be deeply missed. The exhibition ''Making Music Theater,'' currently on display at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, has been dedicated to his memory.
