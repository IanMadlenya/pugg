        ZIEMAN--Isaac. The community of West End Synagogue, a Reconstructionist Congregation, mourns the loss of this extraordinary man. He will always remain our finest exemplar of survival, with competence, compassion and humor intact. Our love to his family, especially his wife Ingeborg, whom we love almost as much as he did. Funeral at 9:30am on Thursday, at Plaza, 91st and Amsterdam.
