        DIMONA-Joe, It is with profound sorrow that we mark the passing of our great friend and associate Joe DiMona, a wonderful author and quintessential New Yorker. We will miss his high spirits and intellect greatly, but take solace in the fact that his remarkable body of work, ''Prime Minister of the Underworld'', ''Last Man At Arlington'', ''To the Eagles Nest'' and many others will live forever.
