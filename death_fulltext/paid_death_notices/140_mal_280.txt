        GERMAN-Philip E. On September 21, 1998. Our beloved Phil was too soon snatched from us by a bunch of bees. He died of anaphylactic shock due to multiple beestings. Phil was born in the Bronx, was a World War II veteran, and lived very happily in Princeton, NJ, for the past 24 years. He had a strong, brave heart that was intolerant of discrimination, injustice and hypocrisy. He was vibrant, loving, generous, compassionate, loyal, honest and funny. He had a deep, searching intelligence and sometimes despaired of the unfairness and dishonesty in this wicked world. He was truly a progressive and wonderful person who adored Shakespeare and Bach and hugely relished good food and drink. He leaves behind devastated Elaine, Ted, Matthew, and Laura. He was a ''oner''-and will be terribly missed. In lieu of flowers, please send contributions to the ACLU or Planned Parenthood.
