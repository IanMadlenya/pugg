        BILLINGS-Josephine. It is with sadness that the Board of Trustees of the New York Blood Center records the death of its former Trustee. Mrs. Billings was an early advocate of the Blood Center and dedicated member of the Board. She contributed greatly to the Center's growth. We extend our sympathies to the family. John Mullen, Chairman Board of Trustees Robert L. Jones, MD, President, NYBC
