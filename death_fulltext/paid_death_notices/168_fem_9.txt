        KLEPPER-Rose Fanny Cohen. ''...and in his infinite wisdom, kindness and love God created the most wonderful wife, mother, grandmother and great grandmother & named her Rose Fanny Cohen Klepper. ...and it was so. And God saw that it was good.'' Her husband Ely Klepper, her children Eleanor and Allen Katz and Michael Klepper, along with her grandchildren Caren and Ronold Epstein, Sylvie and David Standley, Jeffrey Katz, Ron Klepper and her great grandchildren Brandon Epstein & Brett Standley mourn her passing, knowing that each of them was touched by someone very special, someone Heaven sent.
