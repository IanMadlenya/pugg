        COHEN--Alan N. The President and Trustees of Columbia University express deep sorrow at the passing of our esteemed alumnus Alan N. Cohen, a graduate of the Columbia College class of 1952 and the Columbia Law School class of 1954. He was a former member of the Boards of Visitors for both Columbia College and the Law School, and his leadership as a chair of the Law School's Annual Fund was marked by enthusiasm and distinction. Columbia University extends its profound sympathy to his wife, Mrs. Carol Cohen, and their family. Lee C. Bollinger, President of the University David J. Stern, Chair of the Trustees
