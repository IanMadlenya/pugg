        HEICKLEN--Lewis Hadas sah, The Women's Zionist Organization of America, mourns the loss of Lewis Heicklen, of Bala Cynwyd, PA, at the age of 101, a major donor and beloved father of Jane Zolot, a long-time member of the National Board. Mr. Heicklen and his wife, the late Betty Payes Heicklen, who was a Past President of the Philadelphia Chapter, were devoted to Hadassah and engendered that love in their family. Mr. Heicklen's passion for Hadassah also extended to his circle of friends, who through his good services became major donors to the organization, and were affectionately known as the three Lews. He leaves behind Jane and Mickey Zolot, Natalie Bogash and Sandy and Bud Kohn; nine grandchildren; seven great - grandchildren and one great great grandson. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
