        OSTER--Abe. We are without words to express the depth of our sadness at Abe's sudden and untimely death. He was larger than life in so many ways--to his family, the Jewish community, to his friends and to his business associates. He will stay with us as the truly memorable man that he was. We express our heartfelt sympathy to Annie, Avi and Jane, and know that the memory of his energy, love and devotion will keep him alive in our hearts and minds forever. Ada and Mitchell Benerofe and family
