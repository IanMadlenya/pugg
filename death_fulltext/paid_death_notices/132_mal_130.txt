        PERLMAN-Sam (Pearl). On Wed., Dec. 31, 1997. Many people lost a friend and community activist in the passing of Sam. He was a strong voice against injustice and for the rights of those who were under-served or voiceless, from veterans to the homeless, tenants to the rights of animals. He will be missed. He would want it known how much he loved his daughters, Marcy and Edina, his grandchildren, Java, Levi, NikiLee and Remi and his sister Bea. A Memorial will be held Sunday, January 11, 1998 at 11:00 AM at the Horne-Dannecker Funeral Home, 336 West 23rd Street.
