        MALLIN-Ralph. The people of Tishman Realty & Construction Co., Inc., deeply mourn the loss of our esteemed colleague, Ralph Mallin, and his wife, Gilda, who were among the passengers on Swissair Flight 111. Ralph served as Mechanical/Electrical Engineer & Sr. Project Manager on several of Tishman's most important projects: The Merrill Lynch World Headquarters and J.P. Morgan World Headquarters in New York, and the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center in Washington, D.C. He was the consummate professional and a true gentleman, and we will miss him very much. Our deepest condolences to Ralph and Gilda's three children and their entire family.
