Hirschhorn, alumnus, colleague and friend, a giant in the Law School community. He was an active, vibrant, and devoted member of our alumni family since receiving his J.D. and J.S.D. degrees in 1932 and 1934. He was frequently honored by the Law School and the Law Alumni Association, which awarded him the prestigious Judge Edward Weinfeld Award and named him Director Emeritus. He established his legacy with the Rose and Herbert H. Hirschhorn Scholarship Fund, which has supported promising scholars in their pursuit of legal education. Herb inspired all of us with his zest for life, his passion for the law, and his commitment to make a difference in the world. Richard Revesz, Dean NYU School of Law Lawrence A.
