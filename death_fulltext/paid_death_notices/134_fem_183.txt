        PINCUS-Joan. The Hunter College Community mourns the loss of Joan Pincus, an alumna of the College and long-time and loyal supporter of its endeavors. A graduate of our Political Science Department who went on to become a highly respected attorney, Mrs. Pincus established the Joan Pincus Endowed Scholarship in Political Science at Hunter, thus helping other Hunter students to follow in her footsteps. She also forwarded the arts at Hunter: she and her husband, Sherman Pincus, were members of The Guild for the Kaye, which supports Hunter's Sylvia and Danny Kaye Playhouse. We send our sincerest sympathy to Mrs. Pincus's husband and their entire family. David A. Caputo, President, Hunter College Allan H. Kurtzman, Chair, Hunter College Foundation Joan Masket, Chair, The Guild for the Kaye
        PINCUS-Joan. Barbara and Marty Blumenfeld and their family offer their deepest and heartfelt condolences to Sherman, Judy, Harlan, Conan and Adrienne. Joan, we miss you terribly, but your sweetness and friendship will be with us always.
