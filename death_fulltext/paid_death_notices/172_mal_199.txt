        BEROWITZ-Howard. Of North Caldwell, N.J., on May 17, 2001 at home. Howard was a prominent attorney in Clifton, New Jersey for over 40 years. We will cherish his continued love of his family, friends and colleagues, his generosity, his love of music and his daily read of The New York Times. He leaves a family and many friends far and wide: wife Janet, daughter Deborah, daughter Susan and sonin-law Chris, son David and daughter-in-law Danette, mother Sophie & grandson Jacob. Contributions in his memory may be made to the Clifton Memorial Library, or the West Essex First Aid Squad. Sweet dad. We'll miss you, but your songs will live in our hearts forever. Rest in peace.
