        LEWIS-Bobo. On Friday morning, October 30th. A long revered actress equally at home on stage and in front of the camera. Ms. Lewis enjoyed a long career that encompassed an astonishing variety of work. Among her Broadway credits are 42nd Street, Musical Comedy Murders of 1940, Twigs, and Working, for which she won a Drama Desk Award. Film credits include Le Sauvage, The Wild Party, The Paper, and just recently, One True Thing. TV viewers remember her fondly for many guest appearances such as Bewitched and That Girl, and to a new generation of viewers, she is Midge Smoot of Shining Times Station. Ms. Lewis was very proud of her work with Circle Repertory Theatre in new plays such as The Diviners and The Runner Stumbles. Last year she was nominated for a Joseph Jefferson Award for her appearance as Stella in Light Up the Sky. A world-traveling lover of life and the arts, Bobo Lewis is survived by her cousin, Susan Lero of Florida, and her many, many friends. She will be missed.
