        O'SULLIVAN - Timothy. The Board of Trustees and Staff of the Wildlife Conservation Society are deeply saddened by the loss of our dear friend & long-time employee who died tragically on September 11 at the World Trade Center. Tim began his career in 1973 as personnel manager and in 1976, through his retirement in 1997, was Deputy Director of Administrative Services. His responsibilities and accomplishments included acting as WCS Labor Relations and Employment Specialist. He was a central figure in labor negotiations between cultural institutions and NYC. Tim was instrumental in establishing the Cultural Institutions Retirement System, the largest multi-employee pension plan among NYC cultural institutions. He was an instructor for 20 years at the AZA's professional training school, as well as the AMA. Tim served on the Board of St. Barnabas Hospital and Empire Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Tim's dedication, concern and his embodiment of Irish humor and cheer will be sorely missed. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his family. In lieu of flowers, please send contributions to the WCS/Tim O'Sullivan Victims Relief Fund C/O Wildlife Conservation Society, 2300 Southern Boulevard, Bronx, New York 10460. David T. Schiff, Chairman Steven E. Sanderson, Pres. & CEO
