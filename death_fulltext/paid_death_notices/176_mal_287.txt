        HAYNES-W. Ward, 35, of Rye. A commodities broker for Cantor Fitzgerald, he died tragically and without cause on Tuesday, September 11, at One World Trade Center. A lifelong resident of Rye, he was a devoted husband to Ann, a loving father to T.J., 12, and to his four-year-old twins, Elizabeth and Billy. He was the cherished son of Barbara Haynes and the late Hayter Haynes; the classic big brother to Katie Pepe and T.J. Haynes; and the beloved grandson of Mrs. Thomas G. Burke. He is also survived by two uncles, Mr. Thomas W. Burke of Rye and Mr. John B. Burke of White Plains, their families-and more friends than you can count. A 1984 graduate of Rye High School, Ward graduated from Northeastern University and had worked as a golf picture editor for Sports Illustrated. He joined Cantor Fitzgerald last month. A memorial service will be held Saturday, September 22, at 2 P.M., at the Church of the Resurrection in Rye. In lieu of flowers, the Haynes family requests that contributions be made to the W. Ward Haynes Family Education and Charity Memorial Fund, C/O DeCaro and DeCaro, P.C., 3000 Westchester Avenue, Purchase, New York 10577.
