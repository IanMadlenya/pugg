        MCNAMEE-Margaret Ellen. The people of Tishman Realty and Construction Co, Inc. mourn the loss of our respected and dear colleague, Margaret McNamee, and extend our sincere sympathy to her parents, sisters, and family. She was totally dedicated to helping people in her position of Benefits Manager, had a wonderful sense of humor, and was a humanist in every sense of the word. We will miss her deeply.
