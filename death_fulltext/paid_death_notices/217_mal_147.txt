        MILLER--Arthur. The Council of the Dramatists Guild of America mourns the death of legendary playwright Arthur Miller. For over 60 years, his unique voice challenged us as individuals and as a nation to question who we were, who we are, and who we wanted to be. ''In the theater, you have the great possibility of confronting people where they are most troubled, most confused and most desirous of some kind of patterns for the chaos'' Arthur Miller, 1978. We, his colleagues, though saddened by his loss, are emboldened by his courageous life and will strive to continue creating patterns that make sense of the chaos. Our deepest sympathies to his loved ones at this difficult time. John Weidman, President The Dramatist Guild of America
