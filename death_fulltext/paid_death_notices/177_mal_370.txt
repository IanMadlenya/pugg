        BONIME-Walter. The faculty of The Psychoanalytic Institute and The Department of Psychiatry at New York Medical College are saddened by the loss of their respected colleague, teacher and friend. A psychoanalytic innovator, he was widely known for his pioneering work on the clinical understanding of dreams. He was a gifted writer, devoted teacher and compassionate physician who will be greatly missed. We extend our sympathy to his daughter, Karen, son, Stephen, stepson, Frank, stepdaughter, Norma, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Joseph T. English, M.D., Chairman Department of Psychiatry Myron L. Glucksman, M.D., Director, Psychoanalytic Institute
