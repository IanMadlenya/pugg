        BERGMAN--Andrew. Loved and admired son of Elliot and Sybil. Brother to Clifford and Marilyn, uncle to Kuper and Asher. He was the author of ''The Will to Travel'' and an Advocate for the Handicapped. Despite severe disabilities he traveled to Europe, New Zealand, Australia and Greenland. On March 23, 2004, after a bout with pneumonia, he embarked on his final trip. He was 47 years old and he had to desperately fight for every year. He will be sorely missed.
