        $(6$)GLABMAN--SHELDON, MD The Association of the Attending Staff of the Mount Sinai Hospital deeply mourns the passing of our long-standing colleague, mentor, and friend. Consummate nephrologist and internist, Dr. Glabman came to Mount Sinai almost 50 years ago, training generations of medical students and residents in dialysis and all aspects of renal disease. He was a recipient of the prestigious Jacobi Medallion award in 1997. From 1995-1996, he served as AAS President, leading the physicians through challenging times in health care policy. He was a quiet voice of reason. Dr. Glabman was a lover of words, music, ballet, opera, fly-fishing, fine wine, sports, and most especially, the people in his life. We will always remember his understated intelligence and his loyalty to this institution. We extend our sincere condolences to his entire family.
