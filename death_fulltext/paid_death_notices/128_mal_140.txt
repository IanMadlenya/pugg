        FULLAM-Eugene. A very special friend and a very special partner. Gene was a dedicated, forceful visionary who, unfortunately, was not granted sufficient time to see the fruition of his development dreams for Orange County. To his dear wife Adele and his great sons and daughters, my deepest sympathies. I shall also dearly miss Gene. Jerome Belson
        FULLAM-Eugene Joseph. A great man, a great friend, a great partner. You will be greatly missed. To Adele, Gene, Peter, Anne, Kristin and Karen, our love and thoughts are with you. Phyllis and Alan Wolpert
