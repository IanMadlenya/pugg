        TROTZKY-Helen. The officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Helen Trotzky, beloved grandmother of Cathy Zises, a cherished friend of UJA-Federation. Cathy, a trustee at the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, and her husband, Seymour, a member of the Board of UJAFederation, are generous and devoted leaders of Jewish and humanitarian causes. We extend our deepest sympathies to Cathy & Seymour, and to their entire family. Larry Zicklin, President Morris W. Offit, Chair of the Board John S. Ruskay, Exec. V.P. & C.E.O.
