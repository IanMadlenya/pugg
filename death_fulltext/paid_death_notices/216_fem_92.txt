        BLAINE--Josephine. Beloved wife of the late Dr. Robert Blaine. An unforgettable, honest, generous, strong and loving presence for her many friends, nieces and nephews. Long time resident of the Upper West Side, active in politics, she worked for the preservation of landmarks and historical districts. A tireless advocate for the disabled, she was Director of the New York City Office of the Commission for the Blind and Visually Handicapped until her early retirement in 1994. A wonderful human being, taken from us far too young, we all mourn her loss. Survived by her niece Margaret Hood, her nephew Tim Maines, and the countless friends who were devoted to her.
