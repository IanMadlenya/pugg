        DOHERTY--Thomas. Sister Elizabeth A. Hill, President, the Board of Trustees, and the entire St. Joseph's College community would like to express their deepest condolences to the family of Thomas Doherty. As a member of the College's Board of Trustees for 21 years and as Chairman of the Board from 1992 to 1996, Tom was a dedicated supporter of St. Joseph's. His wisdom and counsel was an integral part of our success and growth as an institution. Tom was a gentleman in every sense of the word, and his kindness and generosity served as a living testament of our mission. We are truly saddened by his passing, and his loved ones are in our thoughts and prayers.
