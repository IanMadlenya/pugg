        LACHMAN-Lawrence. The Board of Trustees of New York University and the entire NYU community mark with great sadness the death of Lawrence Lachman: alumnus, trustee of the university from 1974 to 1990, and emeritus member of the Stern School's Board of Overseeers. He embraced every aspect of University life: Top-ranked student, stellar athlete, devoted alumnus. His list of achievements both at NYU and after, his sense of commitment and service, his keen mind and business sense, and his kind spirit and manner serve as an example to all. He will be greatly missed. L. Jay Oliva, President Laurence A. Tisch, Chairman Board of Trustees
