        SALZ-Margaret. Died suddenly on June 20, 1999, Mrs. Salz was born in Berlin, Germany and was a longtime resident of Gramercy Park, New York City. She was a very special person. The twinkle in her eyes and the radiance of her smile were more brilliant than the jewelry she loved and worked with every day. She enriched many lives and although she did not make her 100th birthday, her spirit will stay with us all forever and ever. A memorial service will be announced at a later date.
