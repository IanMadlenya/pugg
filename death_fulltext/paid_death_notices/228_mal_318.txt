        LANDSBERGER--Rudy. On January 26, 2006, of Teaneck, NJ. Beloved husband of the late Margot. Devoted father of Joan and Peter Feldman. Proud Opa to Joshua and Jeffrey. Loving uncle of Katinka, Fritz and the late Annemarie. Just shy of his 98th birthday, this ''Little Man'' with a big, strong heart was loved by all who had the good fortune to have known him. We admire you for the dignity, strength and courage you have shown over the last two years; no more pain. We will miss you every day. Donations may be made to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.
