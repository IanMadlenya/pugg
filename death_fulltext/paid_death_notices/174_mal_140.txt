        POTTER-C. Nicholas. His fellow trustees and the administrative staff of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation mourn the untimely passing of a beloved colleague and wonderful friend. An engaging man of thoughtfully chosen words, all of them incisive, Nick Potter brought an informed and steady voice to the Foundation's deliberations, playing an especially crucial role on its finance committee. Introduced to the board by former trustee and chairman, Robert V. Lindsey, his colleague at J. P. Morgan & Co., Nick Potter for years shared not only his generosity of spirit but a profound understanding of the Foundation's investments. His unflagging concern for the well-being of the artists, scholars, and scientists who received fellowships spoke volumes about his values. All of us conncected with the Foundation feel fortunate to have had the privilege of knowing and working with this collegial, quietly eloquent man. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Clare, and to the members of their family. Joseph A. Rice, Chairman Board of Trustees Joel Conarroe, President Coleen Higgins-Jacob CFO and Treasurer
