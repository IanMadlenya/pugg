        GREEN-Anna Feinzig. The Directors, campers and staff of Timber Lake Camp mourn the loss of our great friend and former director. Her strength, vitality, vision and adherence to the highest standards of quality were an inspiration to all of us. Literally thousands of children and staff have been touched by her compassion, wisdom and constant encouragement. Her energy, generosity, strength and continual guidance will be missed by all of us at camp, a loss that is shared by her many friends and family. Our sympathies go out to her beloved husband Abe, her son Noel Feinzig, daughter-in-law Randi, her daughter Bonnie Rechler, son-in-law Bennett, her sister Trudy, and her cherished grandchildren, Halley, Zachary, Hailey and Brittney. Jay and Mindy Jacobs, Directors Timber Lake Camp
