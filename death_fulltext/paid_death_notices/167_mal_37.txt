        SHAKESHAFT-Peter. With profound sorrow, the Berkeley Carroll School records the sudden death on November 29 of our beloved teacher, dean and coach. Peter loved our school ferociously, and he shared his heart of gold generously. A Berkeley Carroll parent and member of the faculty since 1984, he leaves a legacy of passion for our school, its students, academic excellence, and a zeal for athletics, especially soccer. Our love and deepest sympathy go to his son, Larry, Class of 1999, his daughter, Jordan, Class of 2001, their mother, Helen Chan, his sisters, Valerie Lynch and Rosalind Inglis, and his fiancee, Antoinette Duncan. To honor and celebrate Peter's life, the School will hold a memorial service on Monday, December 4, 3:30 PM, at Old First Church, 7th Avenue and Carroll Street, in Park Slope.
