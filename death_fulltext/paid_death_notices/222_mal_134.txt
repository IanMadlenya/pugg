        LEVITT--Mortimer. On July 12, your great and courageous heart could no longer sustain life in you. During the 98 years you spent on this earth you were known as merchant prince, philanthropist, producer, author, and above all as a confirmed iconoclast. You wanted to live to 104, but you will live much longer because we will carry forward your vision and your dreams. Your wife Mimi, your daughter Elizabeth, and your son Peter, will miss your strong presence and your wonderful sense of humor. You influenced the lives of many people with your intelligence, your creativity, your exquisite taste and your zest for life. We will celebrate your remarkable accomplishments and your extraordinary spirit at a memorial tribute a la Mortimer in September. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be sent to Young Concert Artists, 250 West 57 St., New York, NY, or Friends of the Levitt Pavilion, 85 East Holly St., Pasadena CA. 91103.
        LEVITT -- Mortimer. The Board, staff, and past and present artists of Young Concert Artists are deeply saddened at the loss of our beloved friend, inspiration, and mentor, Mortimer Levitt. Mortimer was an amazing force. He came to us when YCA was a fledgling organization. With his vision, focus, and tremendous pleasure in music (especially piano playing) he spurred and guided the organization's growth over almost 30 years as Chairman of the Board, and years longer before and after. He will never, ever be far from our thoughts. The many YCA artists who were the recipients of the endowed Mortimer Levitt Career Development Award for Women Artists and the Mortimer Levitt Piano Chair benefited hugely from his interest and concern. Charles joins us in sending love and sympathy to his adored wife, Mimi, and their children, Peter and Elizabeth. Susan Wadsworth, Director, the Board of Directors, and Peter Marino, Chairman, of YOUNG CONCERT ARTISTS
