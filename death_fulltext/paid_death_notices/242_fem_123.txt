        CHESS--Stella. The Board of Directors, faculty and staff of the New York University Child Study Center and the Bellevue Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry are saddened by the death of Stella Chess, M.D., the first Professor of Child Psychiatry at NYU. Dr. Chess created the legendary and pivotal New York Longitudinal Study, which delineated the crucial role of individual temperament in child development and ''goodness of fit'' between parent and child. Dr. Chess was a beloved and distinguished teacher and member of our faculty. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to her children and grandchildren. Brooke Garber Neidich, Chair; Harold S. Koplewicz, M.D., Director NYU Child Study Center
