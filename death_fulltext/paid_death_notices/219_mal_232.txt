        UVILLER--H. Richard. Dean David Schizer and the faculty, students and staff of Columbia Law School mourn the death of our friend and colleague, Richard Uviller, the Arthur Levitt Professor Emeritus of Law, after a battle with cancer that began last fall. We will always remember Professor Uviller's kindness, optimism, good humor, and the generosity he showed to all in the Columbia community. Our hearts go out to his wife Rena, our graduate of the Class of 1962, and to their daughter Daphne; Daphne's husband, Sacha Spector, and their daughter Talia. Professor Uviller was a 1953 graduate of Yale Law School. Before coming to Columbia, he spent the bulk of his distinguished career as an Assistant District Attorney's in the Manhattan District Attorneys Office. Richard was an outstanding public servant in that highly respected office becoming chief of its Appeals Bureau for 14 years. He joined the Columbia faculty in 1968 and soon became widely recognized as one of the nations foremost authorities on criminal procedure and evidence. Professor Uviller was the author of four books and numerous essays, articles, and case comments. He was a leading advocate in numerous cases before the Supreme Court. Richard made an invaluable contribution to Columbia over the last four decades. His teaching touched innumerable lives and his scholarship has built the School's reputation as a center of learning about the criminal justice system. This is a great loss for Columbia and for the legal academy. There will be no funeral, but plans for a memorial service on the Columbia campus are pending.
