        GOLDMAN-Judith. The Board of Directors, Administration, Faculty, Parents and Students of the Hebrew Academy of Nassau County extend their deepest sympathy to our esteemed Honorary President, Eugene Goldman, and to his family, on the passing of his beloved wife Judy. She was the daughter of the late Moses Hornstein, namesake of HANC's Junior High School campus and a major benefactor of HANC in its early years. May the entire Goldman and Hornstein families be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Rabbi Moshe Gottesman, Dean Rabbi Meyer Fendel, Dean Emeritus Harvey Liebman, President Isaac Blachor, Chairman, Board of Directors
