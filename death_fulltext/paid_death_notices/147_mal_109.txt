        BERGER-Graenum. The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) mourns the passing of Graenum Berger, a dynamic humanitarian who made a significant contribution to the Jewish communal world. As a determined advocate for Ethiopian Jewry, he founded the American Association for Ethiopian Jews, and was a long time partner of JDC. Our deepest condolences to his wife, Emma, and his family.
