        OSTOW--Miriam. The Jewish Theological Seminary community mourns the death of Miriam Ostow, a member of our Albert A. List College of Jewish Studies Board of Overseers. A graduate of JTS and Columbia University, where she served as Associate Director of the Eisenhower Center for the Conservation of Human Resources, Miriam was a leader and scholar. As a longtime friend of JTS, she tirelessly supported the Jewish community with a compassionate nature and sharp intellect. Miriam was the lifelong partner to her beloved husband, former Professor of Pastoral Psychiatry at JTS, Dr. Mortimer Ostow. May all her family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
