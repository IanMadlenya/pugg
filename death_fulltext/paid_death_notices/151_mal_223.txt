        EMANUEL-Joseph. The Yeshiva University family mourns the passing of a cherished longtime friend and respected member of the community, whose deep commitment to Jewish education perpetuated the legacy of his distinguished family at YU and our affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary. The Benzion, Clara, Jacob, Sarah, and Joseph Emanuel Fund, established with the Yeshiva Endowment Foundation, Inc., provides scholarships for our undergraduate and graduate students. He was a kind, gentle, humble, and erudite man of great integrity, who will be remembered with reverence by all who knew him. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University David S. Gottesman, Chairman Board of Trustees
