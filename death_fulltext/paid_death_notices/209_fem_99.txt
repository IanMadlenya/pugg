        McMENAMIN -- Joan Stitt. The trustees, faculty and staff of The Masters School are saddened by the passing of this wonderfully wise and warm woman. A 1942 graduate of the school, Joan was a trustee and honorary trustee of The Masters School and a revered educator throughout the independent school world. Joan was a mentor to many and generously shared her experience, insights and knowledge. She will be genuinely missed and remembered by the Dobbs community. We extend our deepest sympathy to her family. Lynn Pilzer Sobel, Chair of the Board Maureen Fonseca, Head of School
