        SCHAGRIN-Pearl Glick. Beloved mother, grandmother, sister, aunt. On Wednesday, January 26. Survived by daughter Wendy Davis, son-in-law Gary Davis, grandsons Adam, Brian, Nick; aunts Sylvia Goodzeit and Lillian Weiss and brother-in-law Dr. Alvah Weiss, nephews and nieces. She lived for her family which seems much, much smaller. We will love and miss her forever. Services are at Riverside Memorial Chapel, New York City, on Friday.
