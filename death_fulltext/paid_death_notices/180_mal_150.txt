        WERBIN-Myron. We are very saddened by the news that the father of our dear partner, Barry Werbin, has passed away. Our spirits are brightened, however, in the knowledge that he lived a long and fruitful life, enjoyed Barry's eternal love and devotion and that he leaves a loving daughter-in-law, Lisa, and two cherished and adoring grandhildren, Gregory and Kyra. Our heartfelt sympathy and condolences. Herrick, Feinstein LLP
