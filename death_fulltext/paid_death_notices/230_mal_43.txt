        $(6$)DRYFOOS -- Robert. The Board of Directors and staff of the New York Jr. Tennis League and the Sports and Arts in Schools Foundation mourn the passing of a dear friend and colleague. Bob was among the first to understand the importance of tennis and other sports and arts programs as a character and life-skills building vehicle for children. He was the leading advocate of after-school programs for city children, especially in the public schools. Skip Hartman Jim O'Neill Bill Wiese
