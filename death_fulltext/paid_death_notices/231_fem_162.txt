        MELTZER--Helen. Died at 93 on April 16, 2006 in Beverly Hills, California after a long life lived to the fullest. Raised in Worcester, MA, she moved to New York in 1935 and lived there joyously until 1972 when she and her late husband, Allan Meltzer, moved to Key Biscayne, FL. She designed shoes and fabrics, and for the last 40 years of her life was a sculptor. With a shared passion for food, wine and art, she and Allan visited Europe twice a year for over thirty years. Helen and best friend Florence Aaron continued that tradition and were widely known as the original ''Thelma and Louise.'' From homeless shelters to the Russian war relief efforts to the Lowe Art Museum in Miami, she worked tirelessly for her political convictions and artistic passions. She is survived by her daughter, Pat Tourk Lee, her grandchildren, Jessica and David Friedman and Alex and Ruby Tourk, her great-grandchildren, Hannah Friedman and Joe Tourk, and her siblings, Georgia Gibbs and Bob Gibson. In lieu of flowers donations may be sent to the People for the American Way Foundation, in memory of Helen Meltzer, Attn: Anatasia Staten, 2000 M Street, NW, Suite 400, Washington, DC 20036.
