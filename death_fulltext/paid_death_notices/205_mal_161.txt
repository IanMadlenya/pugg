        KURTZ--Morton, MD. The Officers, Counselors and Trustees of the Medical Society of the State of New York (MSSNY) record with deep sorrow the passing of their past president, friend and esteemed colleague. ''Morty'' Kurtz practiced medicine in Queens for 50 years and enriched the lives of innumerable patients, friends and fellow physicians. Dr. Kurtz was a caring physician, knowledgeable medical practitioner and a true humanitarian. As President of MSSNY (1992-1993), his leadership and thoughtful deliberation were invaluable in the formation of society policy aimed at bettering healthcare for all New Yorkers. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife Georgine, his family and his friends. Jeffrey Ribner, MD, Pres.
