        SCHWARTZ-Rhoda Kulick (nee Slater). Died peacefully, this past Thursday night in Fort Myers, FL. A respected artist and amateur actress, Mrs. Schwartz was born in NYC in 1914 and, during her life, resided in NYC, Ossening, NY, and Southbury, CT, before moving to Florida six years ago. After the illness of her first husband, Saul, she became a successful woman executive at a time when few women worked at all. She enjoyed a wonderful second marriage to Joseph Schwartz. She is survived by Susan Kulick, her daughter, Daniel Kulick, her son, and three grandchildren: Mallory, Candice and Alexander Kulick. She and her husband, Joe, are together now and we will forever remember them with love, respect and gratitude for lives well and lovingly lived.
