        POPKIN-George L., M.D. The faculty, alumni, residents and staff of the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology, New York University, record with a deep sense of loss the sudden death of Dr. George L. Popkin, who had been associated with the Department for over fifty years. George trained at Skin & Cancer and rose through our faculty ranks, serving for the last thirty years, as Clinical Professor of Dermatology. He epitomized the very best among our clinical voluntary faculty members. One of the founders of the sub-specialty of Dermatologic Surgery, Dr. Popkin served as Head of our Skin Surgery Section and our Monday Service for many years. George was truly a sweet human being; a dedicated, gifted physician, an exemplary teacher and a loyal friend to all of us. We offer our condolences to his wife Sally and all of his family and friends. Irwin M. Freedberg, M.D. George Miller MacKee, Professor and Chairman
