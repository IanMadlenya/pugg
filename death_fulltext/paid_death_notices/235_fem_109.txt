        BENNETT--Betty T. The Board of Directors of the Keats-Shelley Association of America mourns the death on August 12 of our longtime Director and dear friend. A major scholar of the English Romantics and an authority on Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, she served as Book Review Editor of our Journal and organized for us important conferences centered on Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Shelley. We shall miss her creative energy, her keen intellect, her kindness and her genuine friendship. Our condolences to her sons, Matthew and Peter, and to her brother, Marvin Edelman.
