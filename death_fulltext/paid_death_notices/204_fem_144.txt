        TRAPP -- Katarina. Of 4 Heathcote Road, Scarsdale, died on January 11, 2004 of natural causes at the age of 100 (birth date November 30, 1903). She had lived in Scarsdale over 35 years.

She was born in Berlin, Germany and immigrated to the U.S. in 1956. She had a passion for music, animals, opera and the theater. In lieu of flowers, my grandmother would have wished a donation made out in her memory to the AIDS Action Committee at 294 Washington Street, Attention: Bob O'Neil, Suite 500, Boston, MA. 02108.
