        FRYER-Dr. Katharine Homer, passed away on January 5, after a long ordeal with ovarian cancer. Dr. Fryer obtained her doctorate from NYU and taught at that institution and at C.W. Post. Since 1995 she has been Director of the Fryer Research Center, a healthcare organization that offers a biochemical-nutrional treatment for mental disorders. Her serious avocation was singing. She performed in a series of concerts at The National Arts Club in New York, the Amato Opera and in the Opera in Central Park. In her teenage years, Dr. Fryer was afflicted by a severe thryoid deficiency that went undiagnosed and nearly led to an early demise. After encountering little success in New York, a simple country doctor in Florida finally identified the problem and prescribed medication that saved her life. This ordeal became the subject of a book authored by her mother, and simply titled ''Kathy.'' Dr. Fryer is survived by her three sisters, Dr. Judy Shedden, a financial planner in New York City, her twin sister, Anne Eddis, a violinist with the New York City Opera, and Dr. Sarah Fryer Leibowitz, a Professor of Neurobiology at The Rockefeller University. Dr. Fryer's life was dedicated to giving to others through her professional work and her artistry. Her strength, courage, warmth and graciousness will be sorely missed by many well beyond her immediate family and friends. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to the Fryer Research Center, 30 East 40th Street, Suite 608, New York, NY 10016.
