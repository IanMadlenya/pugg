        HELLER-Frank. The Yeshiva University family mourns the passing of a longtime friend and major supporter of YU, and its Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, beloved husband of Grace, member of the board of AECOM's National Women's Division, and father of Carol (and Herbert) Corbin, and Nancy Heller, CSL Fellow. A distinguished communal leader in behalf of Jewish education, he was former President of the Board of Jewish Education of Greater NY and of Camp Morasha and recipient of YU's Heritage Award. We extend heartfelt condolences as well to his brother Michael (and Sylvia) Heller, Fellows of our affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary; grandchildren I. Jeffrey and Suzanne L. Corbin, CSL Fellows, and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University David S. Gottesman, Chairman Board of Trustees
        HELLER-Frank. We mourn the loss of our long-term President and current Chairman. His leadership of Camp Morasha saw it through its organizational and formative years. Under that leadership, there was created an educational institution which has touched the lives of thousands of campers and staff. Their commitment to Torah and the Jewish people reflected his own and we are all indebted to him for a model of service and outstanding lay leadership. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Grace and the entire family. Camp Morasha, Inc. Martin Schwarzschild, President Rabbi Abraham Wahrhaftig, Executive Director Zvi Reich, Founding Director
