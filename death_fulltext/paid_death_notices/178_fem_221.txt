        CAPA-Edith. The Trustees and staff of the International Center of Photography mourn the passing of the beloved wife of our Founder, Cornell Capa. His partner throughout a long and loving marriage, Edie also supported and nurtured the endeavors of all the ICP staff from the start of this institution. Her fierce commitment to the work of Cornell and the late Robert Capa, and the ''concerned'' photographers who inspired the founding of ICP, created the first archives of this institution and laid the foundation for the present-day collections. Her selfless dedication to ICP has been unwavering and an inspiration to us all. Held in the highest respect and affection, and always an important member of the ICP family, she will be deeply missed. Our heartfelt sympathy to Cornell and to Edie's many friends, whose great loss we share. Rita Hillman, Honorary Chair Gayle Greenhill, Chairman Raymond J. McGuire, President Willis Hartshorn, Director
