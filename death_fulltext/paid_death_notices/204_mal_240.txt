        TISHMAN--Alan V. Alan provided me with a significant opportunity early in my career. I worked under his direction. He was my mentor and provided me with the finest real estate education possible at that time. He was exemplary on matters of ethics. He was a teacher, philanthropist, visionary, civic leader and friend. I will treasure the years we worked together. My deepest sympathy to Peggy and the Tishman family. Kenneth D. Laub
