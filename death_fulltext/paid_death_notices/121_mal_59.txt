        WACHTEL-Harry. With profound sorrow we mark the passing of a man whose life was dedicated to freedom, justice and civil rights for all and was filled with pleasures shared with family and friends. His warmth and caring will be deeply missed by his wife Lucy; children Alan, Susanna and Bill; daughtersin-law Ellen and Katherine; grandchildren Carly, Nicholas, Jesse, Jonathan, Madeline, Branden; family, friends and colleagues. The memorial service will be on Wednesday, February 5, 4 PM at Unitarian Universalist Congregation, 48 Shelter Rock Rd., Manhasset.
