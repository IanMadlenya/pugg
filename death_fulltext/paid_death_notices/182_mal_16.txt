        LOTT-Robert Reverend. We at Herrick, Feinstein LLP wish to pay tribute to Reverend Robert V. Lott, an extraordinary person and treasured client. Father Lott cared deeply about those in need, including particularly the elderly and the poor, and just as important, developed practical ways of helping. As Chair and President of SFDS Development Corp, Father Lott built hundreds of units of low-income housing. He was a pioneer in creating New York's first affordable assisted living facility and we were honored to work with him on this wonderful project. A handsome facility on 5th Ave & 108 St stands as a living testament to his vision. We will miss his unique sense of mission and on a personal level, his graciousness and kindness. He accomplished much and inspired many. His memory will live on.
        LOTT-Rev. Robert V. The Board and staff of the Neighborhood Coalition for Shelter deeply mourn the loss of our friend, Robert Lott. They are joined by the hundreds of men who have benefited from his generosity in helping establish and hosting the NCS men's shelter at St. Francis. The housing that he created will stand as a testament to his life-long dedication to building healthy communities. Stephanie Guest, President Anne R. Teicher, Executive Director
