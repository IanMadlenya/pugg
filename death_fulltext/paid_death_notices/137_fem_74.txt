        RODZIANKO-Lubov, 95 years old. The Sovereign Order of the Orthodox Knights Hospitaller of St. John of Jerusalem notes with deep sorrow the passing of Dame Commander Grand Cross Lubov Rodzianko, LLD, June 5, 1998, in Palm Beach, Florida. Together with her late husband, Col. Paul Rodzianko III, she devoted her distinguished life trying to relieve suffering humanity, via the UN and UNESCO where she initiated and chaired several actions and committees. She received the U.S. Presidential Citation for Meritorious Personal Service. Since 1973, she devoted much of her time to reviving the Orthodox branch of the Order, drafting its by-laws, writing historical treatises, obtaining the protection of the Russian Imperial family. The Order will never forget its debt to her. We are sharing the sorrow of her son, Paul and his family, who suggested that donations in her name to the Order of St. John would be welcomed, 39 Parkway East, Mount Vernon, New York 10552. Memorial service to be held at a later date in Palm Beach. Memory eternal to a great humanitarian. Count Nicholas Bobrinskoy Grand Prior
