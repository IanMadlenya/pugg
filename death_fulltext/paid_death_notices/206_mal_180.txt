Loved by his sons-in-law Thomas Shattan and Edward Schaeffer, and his grandchildren, Cecily and Woody Shattan, and Olivia and Alex Schaeffer.

        DUNDES--Lester. Once in a blue moon a ''Lester'' comes along to the delight of everyone he meets. We were all so privileged to know the special, never to be forgotten man. Our love and thoughts are with his beloved Seena and the wonderful daughters, sons-in-laws and their beautiful grandchildren. Rest in peace. Dev Buxbaum, Shelly Nudell
