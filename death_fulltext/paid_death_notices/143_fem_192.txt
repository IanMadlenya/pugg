        HALPERN-Caryn, M.D. The column is too short, the borders too narrow to fully tell the story of a life so big: the life of Caryn Keller Halpern, M.D. To all who knew her, she was a skilled pediatrician, a devoted wife and mother, and an intuitive artist. To all who loved her, she was a source of continual joy, energy, inspiration, and love. Born in New Jersey, Caryn graduated from Downstate Medical School at The State University of NY. Her internship, residency, and fellowships included The Albert Einstein College of Medicine, The Bronx Municipal Hospital Center, and Sloan Kettering. In 1974, Caryn moved to Dallas on a fellowship with the Pediatric and Oncology Department of Children's Medical Center, and in 1976 she began her private practice in Pediatrics and Internal Medicine, in which she was active until 1977. Prior to her illness, Caryn was planning to pursue a Scottish Rite Fellowship in Attention Deficit Disorders. Among those who miss Caryn most are the family members she loved so dearly: husband Bill Sechrest, daughters Keller and Edyn, sons Brett, Trent, and Clay, and father Milton Halpern. In keeping with Caryn's passion for life and children, please make donations to the Children's Cancer Fund of Dallas, Inc, in memory of Caryn K. Halpern-Sechrest, 12720 Hillcrest Rd, Suite 120, Dallas, TX 75230.
