        GUTIERREZ -- Gerald. The Board and Staff of Lincoln Center Theater are deeply saddened and mourn the death of our beloved colleague and esteemed Associate Director. Gerry performed theatrical miracles of direction on the Beaumont stage, most recently with his acclaimed production of ''Dinner at Eight''. His productions of ''Ivanov'' and ''Abe Lincoln in Illinois'' also revealed his mastery of the thrust stage configuration that had proved so challenging in earlier times. Gerry's other distinguished and prizewinning productions for our theater included ''The Most Happy Fella'', ''The Heiress'', ''A Delicate Balance'' and ''Ring 'round the Moon''. Gerry was smart, funny, irascible, visionary and oh, so talented. His sudden departure rents the delicate fabric of our theater and we are profoundly grieved. Wake on January 1, 2-5, 7-9pm, Marine Park Funeral Home, 3024 Quentin Rd, Brooklyn. Funeral Service St. Ann's Episcopal Church, 157 Montague St, Brooklyn, 10:30am Friday January 2. John B. Beinecke, Chairman Andre Bishop, Artistic Director Bernard Gersten Executive Producer
