        POLSKY--Howard W. The Faculty, Advisory Council, alumni, staff and students of the Columbia University School of Social Work note with sorrow the untimely death of Professor Howard W. Polsky on October 20 at St. Luke's Hospital in NYC. A member of the School's faculty since 1961, he received his M.S.W. and Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin. A distinguished educator, researcher and prolific author, his book ''Cottage Six, The Social System of Delinquent Boys in Residential Treatment'' is regarded as a social work classic. He made major contributions in the application of social theory to social work, organization development, effectiveness training and other fields of practice. He will be greatly missed by his professional colleagues, and his friends and students at the school. Deepest sympathies are extended to his wife, Dr. Ronnie Berger and the members of his family.
