        RUBIN-Lillian. A great lady who lived a beautiful, caring life has left us! A day spent with Lillian was like a day in the sun. She loved people and in turn was loved by them. We mourn with the Palter and Rubin families and all who knew her. Rest in peace, dearest friend, we shall miss you everyday. Evie and Lou Weissman
