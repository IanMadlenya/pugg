        JAY-John Elliot, age 78. It is with profound sorrow that the partners, associates and staff of Parker Chapin LLP mourn the passing of their former esteemed Senior Partner John E. Jay. He was the founder of the firm's Labor Department and contributed much to its development. He was a dear friend who will be sorely missed. To his family we extend our heartfelt sympathy.
