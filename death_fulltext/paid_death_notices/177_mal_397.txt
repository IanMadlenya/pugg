        KASPER-Charles L. On the occasion of his 55th birthday, the family of D.C. Charles L. Kasper, F.D.N.Y., would like to thank the many, many wonderful people who so generously helped us through this most difficult time. The tremendous outpouring from all who knew Charlie was a beautiful tribute to his life. We would like to especially thank the New York City Fire Department who, in their darkest and saddest days, gave Charlie a hero's tribute. We thank Gov. Pataki, Mayor Guiliani, Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen and Dept. Fire Commissioner Lynn Tierney for attending. Thank you, Snug Harbor, R.H. Tuggs, Battalion Chief William Beyer and the Guitar Ensemble from Curtis H.S. for making his Memorial so personal, so beautiful and so memorable. Thank you cannot adequately express how grateful we are to all of our dear friends and neighbors for all the letters, cards, calls, visits, flowers, food, help and condolences.
