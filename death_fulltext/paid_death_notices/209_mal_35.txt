        WOLSTENHOLME--Sir Gordon. We mourn the passing of a beloved friend. We are fortunate to have had the privilege of knowing this passionate and cultured man and to have enjoyed for many years his irresistibly engaging intellect, charm and wit. His contributions, during a long and distinguished career, to medicine and allied health sciences consisted of acting as initiator, catalyst, and guide. He led the Ciba Foundation, London, from its inception in 1949 and perfected the most difficult of performing arts: productive meeting of brilliant minds. His conception of World Health Service found its culmination in his superb accomplishments as founder and Life President of Action in International Medicine (AIM) from 1988 until this year. His numerous publications, mainly on world health, international cooperation, and medical history revealed his love of medicine and his lifelong efforts to bring healthcare to the remotest parts of the world. These accomplishments were recognized far and wide with numerous honorary degrees. We extend our sympathy and love to his beloved wife Dushanka, his adoring daughters Olivia & Sarah & all his devoted family. Patricia and Michael Bral
