        SMYTH--Craig Hugh. The entire I Tatti community mourns the loss of our beloved friend and mentor, Craig Hugh Smyth. Director of Villa I Tatti from 1973 to 1985, he more than anyone effectively established its eminence as the leading center for advanced, interdisciplinary study of the Italian Renaissance. With self-effacing dedication and limitless generosity, Craig nurtured the institution and those who came there, fostering young talent, encouraging new approaches and endeavors, extolling scholarly achievement, teaching us all the enduring value of humane learning and the life of the mind. He was also the most gracious of hosts, and no one who experienced it will ever forget the warmth of his welcome or the merriment of his smile, his unfailing good humor, his encompassing empathy, his deep caring. For countless Fellows, em ployees, visitors, members of the I Tatti Council, and others associated with that unique institution, Craig Smyth embodied the loftiest ideals of scholar and administrator, of teacher and friend, and of what it means to be a true gentleman. Our loving memory of him, like his incomparable legacy, is imperishable. Deborah Loeb Brice Chairman, I Tatti Council
