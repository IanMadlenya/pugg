        KRALJIC--Nikica Ann. On November 30, 2003 in New York City. Niki passed on a beautiful Sunday afternoon surrounded by the ones who loved her most. She was 69 years old. She lived a very active life and was best known for her brilliant spirit and remarkable elegance. A tremendously intelligent, caring individual, Niki dedicated her life to her friends and family. Known for her generosity, Niki always had a small gift, card or kind gesture for the ones she loved. Niki's personality and attention to detail made her truly distinct. Her remarkable ability to focus and concentrate allowed her to achieve great things that separated her from most. She was an excellent student, earning a Bachelor's degree from Fordham University and a Master's degree from NYU. After completing her studies, Niki spent 40 years as an Economist and Assistant Vice President at New York Life Insurance company. She leaves behind her sisters Frances and Helen, nephew Michael and niece Elizabeth. To our best friend, sister and aunt Didi, no words will ever explain what you mean to us, nor characterize how good you are. You lived a model life and everyone who knew you benefited from your kindess and generosity. You are the best friend and person we have ever known. Without you, our lives are not complete. Now you are in heaven and can rest with Mima and Papa. We will remember you always and lovingly, recall all the good times and adventures we had together. This world has lost a tremendously wonderful person. Our only comfort is that the next world has gained someone truly extraordinary. You will never be forgotten. We love you so much. Family will receive friends 2-5 and 7-9 on Wednesday at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Ave at 81 St. Funeral Mass Thursday at the Guardian Angel R.C. Church, 10th Ave at 21 St. Interment to follow at Calvary Cemetery. XOXO, The Currans, Illijics and Harts
