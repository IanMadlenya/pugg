        SKOLSKY--Mindy W., children's book author of the ''Hannah'' series, will be remembered for her empathetic heart and tender spirit. Wife for 52 years of the late Bernard, they raised two children and enjoyed life together on LI. A 1947 Albany alumna with a BA in English, Mindy loved books, paintings, correspondence, London, and most of all her family. She died peacefully at age 80 in Long Meadow, MA. As was her wish, there was no funeral. She will be missed by Nina and Mark, son-in-law, Jim, grandson, Zachary, friends and all the ''Hannah'' readers.
