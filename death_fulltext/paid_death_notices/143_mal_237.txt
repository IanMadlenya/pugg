        WOLF-Alfred P., Ph.D. The faculty and staff of New York University School of Medicine mourn the passing of Alfred P. Wolf, PhD. who served as research professor in the Department of Psychiatry. His pioneering research into radioactive molecules provided the framework for the development of positron emission tomography and single photon emission tomography to powerful techniques used in fields ranging from neurology to psychiatry and cardiology. We extend our deepest sympathy to his family. Robert M. Glickman, MD Dean, NYU School of Medicine Robert Cancro, MD Lucius N.
