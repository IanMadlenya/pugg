        PETERS-Alton E. The loss of a close friend-and Alton was certainly that-is irreversible and devastating. Only the memory remains, of shared experiences, endeavors undertaken together and perhaps successful, of journeys maybe, certainly of fun-laughter was important to Alton. He was a friend of this family in those senses but in at least one other as well. He was a Trustee of the Harewood House Trust, full of positive advice and wisdom, and incidentally with the best record of attendance of any of us. Details in the garden at Harewood will always remind us of him because they were planted on his advice and all sorts of schemes went forward with important input from him. To his family goes our deepest sympathy. For our part, we'll miss his friendship, his intelligence and warmth, and without him New York will never seem the same.
