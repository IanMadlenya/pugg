        JOEL--Yale. Noted photographer and member of the original Life Magazine staff, died early Saturday morning at the age of 87, of cardiac arrest, in Manhattan where he lived. His some 60 years of images reflect his wit, originality and rapport with people --the same characteristics he brought to his family and friends. He leaves behind his wife of 57 years, Shirley; two sons, both photographers, David of Chicago and wife Susan; Seth of Los Angeles and wife ''Charlie'' Sara Jane; a daughter, Louisa Fanger of Boston and husband Peter; four grandchildren: Max, Sam, Toby and Zoe Joel. Yale, we miss you, your anecdotes, and your love already.
