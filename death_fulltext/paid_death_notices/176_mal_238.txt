        MURRAY-Archibald R. The Association of the Bar of the City of New York is deeply saddened by the passing of Archibald R. Murray. Arch served on the Association's Executive Committee from 1978 to 1983, and was its Chair from 1981 to 1982. Arch also served as President of the New York State Bar Association from 1993 until 1994. Arch was a fighter for access to justice, most notably during his tenure as Attorney-inChief and Executive Director of The Legal Aid Society. With great pride, the Association voted in early September to confer its Association Medal to Arch. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Kay Murray.
