        ERICKSON-Kaaren. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of our beloved colleague and friend, Kaaren Erickson. During her too brief career at the Met, she sang nine roles, including Susanna in ''Le Nozze di Figaro'', Blanche in ''Dialogues of the Carmelites'' and Zerlina in ''Don Giovanni'' and was also heard in the world premier of ''The Voyage.'' We extend our deepest sympathies to her husband, Edward Sooter, and her family. Joseph Volpe, General Manager James Levine, Artistic Director
