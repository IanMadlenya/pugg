        MALLORY-Clifford Day, Jr. The Trustees and Staff of Mystic Seaport, The Museum of America and the Sea, are deeply saddened by the passing of Clifford Mallory. Cliff served the Museum during virtually his entire adult life, becoming a Trustee in 1940 and continually serving until his death on December 7, 2000. During his sixty years on the Board, Cliff held numerous committee and officer positions and served as President from 1976 to 1984 and Chairman of the Board from 1984 to 1988. More important, however, than the positions he held was the impact he had on the Museum and all associated with it through his extraordinary personality. People were naturally drawn to Cliff and his enthusiasm for life and his interests was contagious. For all of us at Mystic Seaport, Cliff was our last link with the earliest days of the Museum which was founded in 1929. Cliff knew the three founders and all those who have led and shaped the Museum through the years. His father and uncle preceded him as President and his son and son-in-law currently serve as Trustees, continuing the family tradition. This involvement in preserving America's maritime history is logical because of the remarkable role the Mallorys have played in that history. The family has been continuously involved in the maritime industry in America since 1816 as sail makers, ship builders, ship owners and shipping brokers. This nearly 200 years of contributions to our maritime heritage was a point of real pride to Cliff who made his impact as head of C.D. Mallory and Company and through his work on behalf of Mystic Seaport. We send our most sincere sympathies to his wife Pauline Cropper Mallory, his daughters Diana Gros Louis and Veronica Stubbs, his son Charles Mallory, his seven grandchildren and his sister Barbara Hathaway and her family. William E. Cook, Chairman J. Revell Carr, President Mystic Seaport, Mystic, CT
