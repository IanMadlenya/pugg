        BRESSLER--Bernard. Bressler, Amery & Ross mourns the death of its founding partner, Bernard Bressler. Bernie was a brilliant man who, second only to his family and many good friends, revered the law. After graduating from Harvard Law School in 1949, where he was an editor of the Harvard Law Review, Bernie's practice focused on counseling a wide range of entrepreneurial businesses in fields such as technology, biotechnology, publishing and public relations. Above all, he was a teacher who, with patience and generosity, loved to explore complex legal and all other intellectual issues with all. He also taught us how to deal with serious illness, and death, directly and with strength and dignity. We will miss him deeply. Funeral services will be held at Temple Sinai, Summit Avenue, Summit, NJ on Tuesday, September 20, at 11 AM. The family will be sitting shiva that evening (only) at 7 PM at the Clubhouse of the Moore Estate, Woodland Road, Morris Township, NJ. The family has requested that any gift be sent to a fund that will be established in Bernie's name, The Bernard Bressler Fund at the Carol Simon Cancer Center of Morristown Memorial Hospital in honor of Dr. Steven Papish, Morristown Memorial Health Foundation, 100 Madison Avenue, Morristown, NJ 07962-1956.
