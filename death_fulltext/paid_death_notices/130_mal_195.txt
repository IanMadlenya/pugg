        BERKOWITZ-Jack. It is with deepest sorrow that the United Cerebral Palsy Association of Nassau County, Inc. (UCP Nassau) records the passing of Jack Berkowitz, a founder of the organization and esteemed board member. Mr. Berkowitz was active with the Spastics Society of Long Island, the predecessor of the agency. When it incorporated as UCP Nassau in 1948 he was elected treasurer and served in that capacity for nearly 30 years, remaining active on the board and key committees throughout his life. His inspired leadership guided the agency through many milestones including the opening of the Roosevelt facility, residential development and computerization. His wisdom, concern and devotion to the agency, and to those it serves, stands as a testament to his legacy. He will be sorely missed. We offer our heartfelt condolences to his beloved wife Clara, their daughters Judith and Susan, son-in-law Robert and grandchildren. Sidney Schwartz, Association President Robert McGuire, Executive Director
