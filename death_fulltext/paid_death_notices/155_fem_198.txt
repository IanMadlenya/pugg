        WELTING-Ruth. The Metropolitan Opera deeply mourns the untimely death of Ruth Welting. Following her debut in 1976 as Zerbinetta in ''Ariadne auf Naxos,'' she sang some 50 performances with our company. With her brilliant upper extension and sparkling stage presence, she was an ideal Olympia in ''Les Contes d'Hoffmann,'' and a thrilling Queen of the Night in Mozart's ''Die Zauberfloete.'' We extend our condolences to her mother, Mary Frances Welting, and to her sisters, Rozelind Merryman and Elizabeth Childers. Joseph Volpe, General Manager James Levine, Artistic Director
