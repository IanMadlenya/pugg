        SCHEINFELD - Jeremy. Your beauty and sweetness were best expressed to us through the joy in your parents' voices and the smiles on their faces whenever they thought or spoke of you, and the glow in your father's eyes whenever he heard your voice on the telephone. Your smile lives on through all you have touched. We extend our deepest sympathies to Jodi and Rob, and the Scheinfeld and Berkman families. The Associates
        SCHEINFELD - Jeremy. Bright, beautiful, sweet, sensitive Jeremy. A piece of each of our hearts goes with you forever. Uncle Joe Dee, Les, Carlee and Bret Judy, Marc, Alex and Samantha
