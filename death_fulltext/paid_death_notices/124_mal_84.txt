        SCHLAIFER-Charles, on Monday, May 5. Beloved husband of Ann Mesavage Schlaifer, cherished father of Arlene Silk and Roberta Semer, devoted grandfather of Nicole Silk, Bruce and Scott Semer. His ''Heart's Work'' was his love for his family, his work in entertainment advertising, and his unflinching commitment in the field of mental illness and health. He co-authored several books and advocated throughout his life for those unable to. He will be remembered for creating and defining the marketing and promotion of movies. His keen sense of what would sell a movie and his creative eye were responsible for the first blockbuster hits. He has left a lasting legacy of goodwill behind and will be missed. Services will be private. He has blessed our lives.
        SCHLAIFER-Charles. On May 5. Dearest father and grandfather, your wit, charm and zest for life will always be in our hearts. You are sorely missed. Love, Roberta, Bruce, Scott, Gigi Semer For info re shiva: Rodeph Sholom, 212-362-8800. Donations to Rodeph Sholom (a special fund) 7 West 83 Street, New York City 10024.
