        ROSENBAUM-Robert, on July 20, 2001. The faculty, staff and students of the Queens College Speech-Language-Hearing Program deeply mourn the death of Robert Lee Rosenbaum. His sensitivity, passion, wisdom, and enduring commitment, for almost half a century, to the undergraduate and graduate programs in SpeechLanguage Pathology and to the Speech-Language and Hearing Center will be remembered and treasured forever. Our deepest condolences to his wife, Evelyn; to his children, Paul and Jennifer, and to his grandchildren. A memorial service will be planned for the fall 2001 at Queens College.
