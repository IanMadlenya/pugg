        NOYES--Margaret Talbott. Sarah Lawrence College notes with deep sorrow the death of Margaret Talbott Noyes, a devoted alumna and dear friend of the College for over fifty years. She served as a member of the Board of Trustees (1958-1963), as did her mother, Margaret Thayer Talbott from 1947 until her death in 1962, and her husband Blancke Noyes from 1972 until his death in 1978. She was a generous supporter of many areas of the College, especially the athletic program and the visual arts program, as befitted an accomplished sportswoman and lover of the arts. We will miss her greatly and send our love and sympathy to her daughter, Audrey, also a graduate of the College, her sons Nicholas, Talbott and Robert and all her family. Margot C. Bogert, Chairman of the Board Michele Tolela Myers, President >>AD#
