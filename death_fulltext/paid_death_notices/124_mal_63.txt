        FREUND-Gerald. It is with profound sadness that his friends and colleagues at the Harlem Educational Activities Fund, Inc. note the passing of Gerald Freund, HEAF's first Executive Director and for many years its Senior Consultant. The HEAF programs he developed, the talented and dedicated HEAF staff members he recruited and trained, and the improved lives of Central Harlem children stand as permanent memorials to this fine man. Daniel Rose, President
