        HOLLOMAN-Dr. John L. S. Jr. Columbia University's Health Sciences Division and the Columbia University Affiliation at Harlem Hospital Center salute the life and mourn the loss of Dr. John L. S. Holloman Jr., physician, servant of the Harlem community and Harlem Hospital Center, and leader in the quest for social justice and proper health care for all. Dr. Holloman exemplified the unswerving physician advocate as a devoted practitioner in the personal care of his patients in the Harlem community, a determined participant in civil rights demonstrations againt racial discrimination, an effective critic of organized medicine's failure to adequately address racial discrimination in health care, the distinguished President of the National Medical Association, the noble President of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, and as the Medical Director of the William F. Ryan Community Health Center. We cherish the life and work of Dr. Holloman, a tireless champion of human rights and justice in medical care. Gerald E.
