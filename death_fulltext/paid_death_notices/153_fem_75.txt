        HANDROS-Cele L. Beloved wife of Richard. She was employed at AHRC for 30 years as Budget Director. She loved and was loved. Services 12 noon Sunday, Plaza Memorial Chapel, 91st Street and Amsterdam Avenue.
        HANDROS-Cele. The Board of Directors, staff, participants and friends of the Association for the Help of Retarded Children wish to convey our heartfelt condolences to Richard, husband of the late Cele Handros. We grieve Cele's death because she was an important member of the AHRC family, beloved by her colleagues and by the members of the Board of Directors as well. Cele was diligent to a fault in her commitment to work of the highest calibre. She was loyal to her friends and colleagues, as well as to the mission of the Association. Cele was in every possible way the ideal AHRC staff person. AHRC depends on the loyalty, care and diligence of many people, but none more so than Cele. Warm, engaging, amusing, yet passionate in her work and in her belief in the Agency's task, Cele will be deeply missed. It is often easy to say that no person is easy to replace, but it is quite clear that we can never replace Cele. A member of our staff and family for over thirty years, Cele would have been honored at an upcoming NYSARC 50th Anniversary Convention for her three decades of dedication. No honor, no celebration can adequately capture this unique and wonderful person.
