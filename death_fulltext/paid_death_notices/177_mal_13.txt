        CANADE-Eugene. A former UN official and an artist, son of artist Vincent Francis Canade, died in Paris on September 16, 2001. Born in New York, on November 22 1914, Eugene Canade received a BA from Brooklyn College in 1939, served as captain in the Medical Administrative Corps of the US Army from 1940 to 1946, and after the war, started working with UNICEF in New York, and soon after, in the Paris office until retirement in 1979. He was a painter, sculptor, and print-maker whose work was exhibited as a one-man show in Paris at the Lucie Krogh gallery in 1963. It was also part of the October 2000 exhibit in Queensbury, New York, ''It Becomes our Life: The William Bronk Collection,'' commemorating his close friend William Bronk. He illustrated a number of books of poetry by William Bronk and by James Weil. Deeply loved by his entire family, he was predeceased by his wife, Ethel S. Canade (May 12, 1912-January 19, 1987). He is survived by his brother Vincent Canade, sisters Celia Raupp and Florence Lambert; his children, Anne and Arsene Bonafous-Murat, Laura and Erwin Solomon, Francesca Canade Sautman, and Bianca and Marvin Bakalar; and by his eight grandchildren and one greatgrandson.
