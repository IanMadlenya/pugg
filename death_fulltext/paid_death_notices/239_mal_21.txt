        CUZZE--Frank J, Jr., 93, September 13, 2006, in Las Vegas, NV. He spent his early career in the New York area, holding a variety of jobs, all involving fixing and maintaining useful technologies. During World War 2, his expertise as a vessel diesel mechanic, earned him a critical-worker designation and a courtesy naval rank of lieutenant commander. After the War, he worked at Grumman Aircraft at Bethpage, on virtually every major military aircraft program there. He then transferred to Grumman's aerospace operation at Cape Kennedy, FL, as a NASA logisticist for the Apollo space program, responsible for maintaining the Lunar Excursion Module for the moon shots. After the lives of the Apollo 13 crew were saved in 1970 when they took refuge in the LEM, Grumman workers (including Cuzze) received NASA and Presidential citations for their efforts. He is survived by his sister, Lucy Restiano, of Lyndhurst, NJ, and brother Paul Cuzze, of Yonkers; his children, Frank J. Cuzze, III, of Austin, TX; Valarie Sebastiano, of Tampa, FL; and Lorre Barbara Cuzze, of Atlanta, GA. His beloved wife of thirty-five years, Violet Zaremba Cuzze, predeceased him in 1976. He is also survived by 5 grandchildren, and 6 greatgrandchildren. Donations in honor of Frank's memory may be made to the Knights of Columbus.
