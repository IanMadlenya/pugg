        KAUFMAN-George M. The trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art are deeply saddened by the death of George M. Kaufman, passionate collector, generous benefactor, and longtime friend. He was, together with his wife Linda, a member of The William Cullen Bryant Fellows, the Friends of The American Wing, and the Visiting Committee, Department of American Decorative Arts. He underwrote the publication of The 18th Century American Furniture Collection, and he endowed two galleries for the display of 18th century American decorative arts. His rare intelligence and infectious enthusiasm will be greatly missed. Philippe de Montebello, Director Morrison H. Heckscher, Chairman of The American Wing
