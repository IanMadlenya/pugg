        KAHN-Rabbi Arthur Dov. The Yeshiva University family is deeply saddened by the passing of a beloved alumnus of Yeshiva College and of our affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary, a brilliant and distinguished rabbinic scholar and leader, and rabbi emeritus of Congregation B'nai Emunah in Tulsa, OK, whose members established the Rabbi Arthur D. Kahn Chair in Hebrew Literature at YU and the Rabbi Arthur D. Kahn Scholarship Fund at RIETS. Our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Miriam; to his children, Shoshana (and Dov) Hikind and David L. (and Nicci) Kahn of Jerusalem; to his brother Rabbi Howard Kahn; to his sister, Mrs. Tziril (and Rabbi Philip Harris) Singer; and to his grandchildren. May the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University Robert M. Beren, Chairman YU Board of Trustees Julius Berman, Chairman RIETS Board of Trustees
