        LINDENBAUM-John, MD. The Columbia University Affiliation and the Medical Board of Harlem Hospital Center mourn the passing of one of our most distinguished colleagues, Dr. John Lindenbaum. Dr. Lindenbaum was a beloved member of our medical staff from 1968 to 1986 and maintained close ties to Harlem Hospital Center until his untimely death. He was an outstanding clinician, a gifted and devoted teacher, an extraordinary research scientist and a trusted friend. He had a profound influence on many generations of physicians as he patiently and unfailingly gave his time, intelligence and good humor. We are fortunate and proud to count him as a member of the Harlem Hospital Family. Edward B. Healton, MD, Senior Associate Dean/Medical Director John T.
