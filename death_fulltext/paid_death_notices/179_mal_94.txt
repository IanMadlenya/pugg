        COWAN-Philip M. The Officers, Trustees and Members of The Copyright Society of the U.S.A. mourn the passing of Philip M. Cowan, our Vice President/President-Elect on December 6, 2001, after a courageous battle with cancer. Phil was diagnosed with cancer just before our June 2000 Annual Meeting. He continued to attend Executive Committee Meetings and to participate in the life of the Society until recently. Phil was a dedicated, consistent and creative contributor to the Society over many years, serving as an officer, trustee, member of the Executive Committee and President-Elect. We are grateful not only for these contributions, but also for the warmth of his personality and his delightful sense of humor. Whether as a speaker, umpire of our annual softball game, a leading entertainment lawyer or a world-class bridge player, he brought insight, enthusiasm and energy to all his activities. Phil was a very special and beloved member of the Society. We will miss him sorely. We extend our deepest sympathies to Edna and the rest of Phil's family, his colleagues at the law firm he founded, and all those who have been touched by his life. The Copyright Society of the U.S.A. Robert J. Bernstein, President
