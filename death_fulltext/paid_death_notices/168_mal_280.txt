        DAVIS-Leonard. It is with deep regret that the staff and Board of Aaron Davis Hall note the passing of our founding benefactor, Leonard Davis. His wife, Sophie, and he were partners in business and philanthropy, advisors to one another and contributed unselfishly to sustain the life of Aaron Davis Hall, named in honor of Leonard's father. For twenty years it has been our pleasure to acknowledge their steadfast generosity, and it was our privilege to honor them both during their lifetimes at our 2000 Benefit Gala. We extend our sincere condolences to his sons, Alan and Michael, their families, and his friend and colleague, Marilyn Hoadley.
