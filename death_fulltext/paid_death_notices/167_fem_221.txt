        SHIFF-Fannie, after 93 years during which she selflessly devoted herself to her late husband, Nat, her sons, Larry and Yaacov, her sister Ceil, brother-in-law Nat and nephew Mickey, and to her late sister and brothers Clara, Harry, and Max, Fannie passed away on December 22, 2000. For the last twelve years of her life she was lovingly cared for by Yaacov and his wife Susie on their Kibbutz, Ein Hashofet, Israel, to which she moved from Miami Beach, and by Larry and his mate, Leslie, from New York. True to her ethic, she worked on the Kibbutz almost to the end, to earn her ''keep'' and avoid being a burden. She was never a burden, she was always loved and she will be missed.
