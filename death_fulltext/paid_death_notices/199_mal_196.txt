        SAIDLOWER--Irving. EMUNAH of America mourns the loss of Irving Saidlower, beloved father of Sylvia Schonfeld, our Chairman of the Board and Honorary National President and her brother Mendy Saidlower. Irving was a devoted father and grandfather, an honorable devout man who was a greatly respected community leader and friend and role model to all who knew him. He loved Israel and the children of EMUNAH. May the family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
