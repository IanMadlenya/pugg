        LICHTENSTEIN - Ira. The Employees of Eric Marder Associates deeply mourn the loss of our Past President. For over 30 years, EMA was his second home and its employees, his second family. Over all those years, and to the very end of his life, we continue to reap the substantial benefits of his brilliant mind, razor-sharp insight, superb judgment and unparalleled negotiating skill. He was voracious in his love of culture in all its forms and we enjoyed sharing those passions vicariously with him. EMA extends its deepest sympathies to his first family: Judy, Scott, Andi, Ron, Josh, Nancy, and all of his grandchildren.
