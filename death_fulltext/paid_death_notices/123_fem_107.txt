        GARILLI-Anne. To celebrate the life of Anne Garilli, who passed away on March 27, 1997, a memorial gathering will be held at The New York Design Center, 200 Lexington Avenue, NY at 5PM on Wednesday, April 16th. Her professional career began in 1960 at Mademoiselle magazine as mail order editor. She rose to the position of associate promotion director and joined Knapp Communications in 1981 as promotion manager. In 1983 she was promoted to promotion director for Architectural Digest. She kept that title when the magazine was acquired by Conde Nast Publications, Inc., in 1993. Know as ''Aggie'' to all who worked with her, she will be as much missed in death as she was loved in life. Friends who wish to honor her memory should make contributions to The American Cancer Society or The Make a Wish Foundation.
