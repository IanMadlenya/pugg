        HERMAN -- George. Died Monday, June 21, 2004, peacefully in Caracas, with his beloved Miriam at his side. A giant among us, he challenged oppression and set an example for all who love family and freedom. With business success in his two adopted countries, those privileged to have known him will miss this modest gentleman of a keen intellect who leaves a legacy of charity and kindness. We offer condolences to his blessed wife of fifty-one years, Miriam, daughters, Dr. Rena Brand, and Lynn Garzon, sons-in-law, Dr. Philip Orbuch, and Isaac Garzon, and grandchildren, Richard, Daniel, David, Alan, Paul, Karen. Randy, Stephen, Samantha and Hayley Cooper
