        GOLDBERG-Arthur M. The Boards, Faculty and Staff of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons, and the Joan and Sanford I. Weill Medical College of Cornell University are deeply saddened by the passing of our great friend and esteemed Hospital Trustee, Arthur M. Goldberg. Mr. Goldberg became a Trustee of The Presbyterian Hospital in 1996. When it merged with The New York Hospital in 1998, he became a Trustee of the merged institution, serving as Co-Chair of the Human Resources Committee. He was a man of great warmth, vision and courage, who was unfailingly devoted to the support of medical education, research and patient care. Mr. Goldberg's wise counsel and guidance were invaluable. He was much loved and will be truly missed. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, children, and grandchildren.
