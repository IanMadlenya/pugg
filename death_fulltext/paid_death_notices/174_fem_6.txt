        ROBIN-Richard. Your colleagues mourn your passing on June 12, 2001, and also celebrate your long and interesting life. Many will miss your sparkling wit, countless stories, your support and the many entertaining political and social discussions of your well travelled life as a man of peace and goodwill. Our heartfelt condolences to your wife, Therese, of 58 years who will keep your spirit alive in the company and to your children, Jacky and her husband, Jeff, and your grandchildren, Scott and Mark Shawn.
