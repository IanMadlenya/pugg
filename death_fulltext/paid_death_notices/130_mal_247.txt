        KIRK-Grayson L. On behalf of the entire University commmunity, the President and Trustees of Columbia University express deep sorrow at the passing of President Emeritus Grayson L. Kirk. During his 17 years of leadership, Dr. Kirk forged a new and expanded role for the American university through the creation of purposeful programs of study at Columbia. His creativity and dedication led to the creation of numerous international programs of exchange and scholarship; major new programs in business, physics, medicine, oceanography, and the arts; and cutting-edge institutes of urban environment and community affairs. Dr. Kirk's efforts also strengthened the University's fiscal standing and led to the doubling of the University Library. Columbia University extends profound sympathy to his son John and his family.
