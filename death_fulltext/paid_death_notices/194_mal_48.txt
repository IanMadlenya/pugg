        SAMUELS-David M. It is with deepest sorrow that we mourn the loss of David M. Samuels on Sunday, March 2, 2003. Loving husband and best friend to Phyllis, adoring and devoted father to Michael and Melissa. He was an exceptional friend who shared his love openly and generously. His gift, the balance of warmth, humor, and opinion, will be greatly missed. As owner, with his wife, of The Petite Shop, David was a visible part of the community and enjoyed the friendships made over the past decades in the clothing business.
        SAMUELS-David M. My dearest David-there's a ribbon in the sky for our love. I'll love you forever, too. Phyllis
        SAMUELS-David. We are heartbroken at the sudden loss of our friend David. We send our love and deepest sympathy to Phyllis, Melissa and Michael. Marsha & Michael Dayan
