Loving grandfather of Molly Conway, Skyler Conway, Thea Palley and Aaron Palley.

Known and loved as ''Willie'' by his many friends and relatives, he retired from the New York City Police Force as a Lieutenant, practiced law for many years and returned to public service with the New York State Commission for the Blind. He was a longtime resident of Ocean Beach, Fire Island. He loved to paint and was greatly admired for his beautiful singing voice, particularly of Yiddish songs. He always loved a good joke. We will all cherish his memory and will miss him terribly. There will be a memorial service for Willie in Ocean Beach, Fire Island in September. Arrangements will be announced.
