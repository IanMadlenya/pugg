        KLEIN-Stanley M. The Officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York are deeply saddened by the tragic death of Stanley M. Klein, longtime president of the Herman Goldman Foundation.

We extend our sincere condolences to his wife, Carole; his son Alan; his son and daughter-in-law Abraham and Cheryl; his father, Harry; and all the members of the family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair James S. Tisch, President Stephen D. Solender, Exec. VP
