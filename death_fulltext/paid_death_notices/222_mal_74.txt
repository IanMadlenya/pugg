        MARTIN--Daniel S., MD. Friends and colleagues of Dr. Dan Martin, Visiting Investigator at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, express their profound grief at his tragic accidental death. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his family. A prominent surgeon, a former Director of Cancer Research at the Catholic Medical Center of Brooklyn and Queens, NY, and a former U.S. Army Medical Corps Captain, Dan devoted his professional life to developing better medicines for the treatment of cancer, especially breast cancer. His entire career demonstrated creativity, courage of conviction, and boundless vigor. He was an early proponent of combination drug treatment and championed its use as an adjunct to surgery, an approach that has saved tens of thousands of lives. We honor him for his lifetime of dedication and achievement, and remain inspired by his vision. He will be greatly missed.
