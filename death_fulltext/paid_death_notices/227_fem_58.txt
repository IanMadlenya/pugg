        WURLITZER--Anna Lee. The Board, Officers, Medical Staff, staff and residents of The Fieldhome and its affiliates note with great sorrow the passing of its devoted Board Member, Mrs. Rembert Wurlitzer. Mrs. Wurlitzer served on the Board of The Fieldhome for more than 50 years, initially on The Women's Auxiliary Board, commencing her service just after World War II. Mrs. Wurlitzer stayed actively involved on the Board of The Fieldhome as it evolved and eventually moved from the city to Westchester County. Lee Wurlitzer will be remembered for her passion and commitment to the care of the elderly, for her wise and compassionate guidance and counsel, and for her generosity for time and spirit. All associated with The Fieldhome have lost a dear and devoted friend and express their deepest sympathy to the family of Lee Wurlitzer. Frederick N.
