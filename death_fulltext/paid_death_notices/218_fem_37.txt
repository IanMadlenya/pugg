        McCASLIN--Nellie. February 28, age 90. The NYU Steinhardt School of Education and the Program in Educational Theatre deeply mourn the loss of Nellie McCaslin, internationally renowned pioneer in creative drama and theatre for young audiences, author, actress and Greenwich Village icon. She was a passionate teacher and beloved mentor and friend to our students and faculty for more than 30 years. Her workshops and speeches around the world reminded us all that children's imagination and creativity are inspired through the arts. Our deepest condolences to her niece, Alexandra Plotkin. A memorial service will be held on April 24 at First Presbyterian Church, 5th Avenue and 12th Street, New York City
