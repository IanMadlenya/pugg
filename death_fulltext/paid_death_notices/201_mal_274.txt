        WASHINGTON -- Walter E. The NYC Housing Authority mourns the passing of Walter E. Washington. He was the tenth Chairman of NYCHA, the nation's largest public housing authority, from 1966-1967 and the first African-American to serve in that capacity. He was a great pioneer in urban social progress who understood the complex problems of our cities. He will be deeply missed.
