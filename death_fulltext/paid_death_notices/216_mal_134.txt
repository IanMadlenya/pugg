        MILLIGAN --James M. Dean David Schizer and the students, faculty and staff of Columbia Law School mourn the death of our dear friend and colleague, Dean of Admissions James M. Milligan. Jim was an integral part of our community for 25 years. He viewed our students as his children, remembering them for decades after they graduated. He was a wonderfully talented admissions professional, and a loyal and dear friend. Jim Milligan served as a trustee of the Law School Admissions Council and on many of its committees. He also served as chairman of Columbia University Community Impact, a nonprofit group that coordinates volunteer social service by students and other members of the Columbia Community. We will all rally around our colleagues in the admissions office, as we all share, and are committed to maintaining, Jim's high standards.
        MILLIGAN--James. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to Karen Blank and her son Ned Milligan on the loss of their beloved husband and father, James Milligan. Your friends and colleagues in the Office of the Dean of Studies and Dean of the College. Barnard College
