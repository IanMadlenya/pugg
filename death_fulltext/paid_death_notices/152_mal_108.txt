        PITTMAN-Kennieth ''Ken,'' one of Manhattanville College's most beloved professors, died on September 8 at the Westchester Medical Center. He was 53 years old. Professor Pittman was an authority on social and political conditions in Mexico and Latin America, and he was widely published and often quoted on related subjects. As a professor of political science at Manhattanville since 1981, he was extremely dedicated to his students, sharing with them his personal experiences and perspectives developed over decades of living, visiting and working in Mexico, particularly in and around the village of Amacuzak. He opened students' eyes to the lives of villages of rural Mexico, so they could pursue their own research and their own opinions. In 1997, Professor Pittman earned the College's Distinguished Faculty Award. In 1998, he co-founded the Connie Hogarth Center for Social Action, which is located at Manhattanville, and he was instrumental in the creation of a Latin American Studies minor at the College. He also served as the faculty advisor to the Latin American Students Organization. Professor Pittman earned a BA from Duke University, an MA from North Carolina State University, an MA, MPhil and PhD from Yale University. He held a postdoctoral fellowship at Yale University, conducted research at El Colegio de Mexico, and held visiting associate professorships at North Carolina State University, Iona College and Purchase College (SUNY). Professor Pittman is survived by his wife, Carolina; daughter, Kenia; sister, Beth Johnson; and brother, James. A memorial service will be held at 7:00 PM on Saturday, September 11 in the O'Byrne Chapel at Manhattanville College, after visitation from 4:00 to 6:00 PM. His funeral and burial will take place in Mexico. Manhattanville College has established a Kennieth Pittman Memorial Fund.
