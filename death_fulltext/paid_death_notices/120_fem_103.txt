        CARLSSON-Florence A. (Ryan). Of Sayville, L.I. until recently of East Meadow, L.I. On January 17, 1997 at age 86. Beloved mother of Kathleen and sister of Frank Ryan. A graduate of Brooklyn Law School in 1938. She practiced privately and in the 1950's became the first woman Assistant District Attorney in Nassau County. She was active for many years in Nassau GOP politics. She was one of the first members of the Nassau County Womens' Bar Association which was formed at least in part because of the then-unwelcoming attitude of the Nassau County Bar Association. She was the first woman President of the Catholic Lawyers Guild of Nassau County. Mass of Christian burial today, Saturday, Janaury 18 at St. Lawrence R.C. Church, Sayville at 10am. Burial follows at St. Lawrence Cemetery, Sayville. Her friends should call her home or office for arrangements to visit the family. In lieu of flowers, donations to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre, for its schools would be appreciated.
