        RUTH-Edith Volin, 86. New York City has lost one of its most exuberant supporters. Youthful and seemingly ageless, Grandma earned her Bachelor's Degree in Art History from Hunter College at age 81, climbed the Grand Canyon at 75, and worked on Wall Street until age 84. She is a role model for many in her will to ''do it all'' in life. We have lost a most precious and inspiring mother, sister, grandmother, great-grandmother, aunt, cousin, and friend. Leslie (deceased), David, Saul and Ethel, Libby and Ben, Samuel (deceased), Irma, Martin & Barbara, Sam, Linda, Amber, Jonsara and Marcus, Josephine, Sebastian, Gabriella, Debby, Ken and Helene, Alicia and Alex, Howard & Karen, Jeffrey, Beth, Sari and Alan, Susan and Andrew, Jacqueline, Andrew, Emily, Madalyn, Matthew, Dana, BJ, Kelsey, Adam. Services will be held at 11 AM, Wednesday, October 10th, Plaza Memorial, 630 Amsterdam Avenue and West 91st Street, NYC. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to The Hunter College Scholarship Fund, 695 Park Ave., NYC 10021.
