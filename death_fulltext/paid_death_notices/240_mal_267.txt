        ROSENBAUM--Cantor Jacob H. The Yeshiva University/ RIETS family is deeply saddened by the passing of our esteemed, long-time Trustee of the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS) who had a special interest in its Philip and Sarah Belz School of Jewish Music. With his beloved wife, Dr. Belle Rosenbaum, he was a YU Guardian, and together they also provided scholarships and supported the YU Museum. Heartfelt condolences are extended to his wife and to his children: Linda (and Alan) Zelinger, Simma (and Rabbi Theodore) Brody, Choni (and Rabbi Avraham Yitzchak) Levene, and Rabbi Yitzchak Moshe (and Sonya) Rosenbaum. May the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel, President Norman Lamm, Chancellor Morry J.
