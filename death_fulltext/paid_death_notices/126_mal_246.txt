        SONNETT-Carl. On July 21, 1997, 73 years young, after a brief and courageous battle. You were taken from us much too soon. Your grandchildren will savor their memories of a playful, loving and affectionate grandfather. We will miss you terribly but in our hearts we know you are at peace and you'll be watching us and with us during all of our days and the days of our children. We love you so very, very much. Your children and grandchildren, Meri, Stacy, Tony, Larry, Avram, Alex, Richard, Evan, Joshua, Jacob and Princess Anna
        SONNETT-Carl. Thank you for all the love and joy you brought into our family. Sherry and Debbie Pearlman Sarah and Rebecca Lessler
