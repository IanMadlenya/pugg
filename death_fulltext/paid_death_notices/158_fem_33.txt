        HOPPENFELD RESIKA-Elsa. Although I had the priviledge of knowing you for a relatively short span of your remarkable 88 year journey, I grew to respect, admire and love you as I have few others. It is said that when a person dies, a library burns down; in your case, Elsa, it's more like a university. Dick Bellach
        HOPPENFELD RESIKA-Elsa. A very special person who never wavered in her love and devotion to her family and friends. Elsa will be missed but never forgotten. Jeanette and Herbert Shirley and Beatrice
