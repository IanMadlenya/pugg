        RIGHT-Charles Alan. The Council and members of The American Law Institute mourn the death of our President, Professor Charles Alan Right. For more than 35 years Charlie played leadership roles in the ALI's attempt to improve the law and the legal system in the United States and internationally. Our former colleague, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, described Charles Alan Right as ''a Colossus at the summit of the profession,'' and referred to ''his brilliance as a scholar, his courage, and his boldness and caring in pursuit of the well-being of our legal system and the men and women who strive to serve it honorably.'' We will miss and remember Charlie as we pursue the unending work of law reform. Michael Traynor, First V.P. Conrad Harper, Second V.P. Bennett Boskey, Treasurer Lance Liebman, Director
