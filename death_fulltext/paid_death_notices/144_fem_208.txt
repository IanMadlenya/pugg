        JONES-Mary Carter. The Officers, Board of Directors and members of the Womens City Club of New York note with sadness the death of our former President, Mary Carter Jones. As a 40+ year member of the WCC, she was an exemplar of those women who cared deeply about their communities and are willing to devote large amounts of time to advancing thoughtful ideas and programs. Her wise counsel will be missed. Our condolences to her children and grandchildren. Elizabeth Lubetkin Lipton, Pres.
