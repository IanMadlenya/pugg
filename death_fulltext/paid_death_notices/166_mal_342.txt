        HUNTER-David R. Died November 24th, 2000 after a long illness. A social worker by training and an activist by inclination, he was a lifelong partisan of freedom and democracy. Widely recognized as the leader of progressive philanthropy both in his years with the Stern Fund, The Ottinger Foundation and other individual funders and then into his non-retirement, he championed many of the social economic and philanthropic organizations that have worked to make this nation live up to its promise. He was a true democrat and a great American. Our condolences to his beloved wife Barbara, stepsons Steven and Daniel and grandchildren Alexandra and Jason. Please send contributions in his honor to your favorite charity. A memorial service will be held at a later date. Friends of David R. Hunter
