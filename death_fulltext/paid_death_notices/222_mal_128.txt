        ZORENSKY--Louis I. The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) mourns the passing of its lifetime Board Member, and generous supporter, Louis Zorensky, who, from his home base in Saint Louis, reached out to Jewish communities around the globe. He had a special concern for jews in the former Soviet Union and in Israel, where he helped sustain JDC's Taub Center For Social Policy Studies, as well as many cultural and educational institutions. All this was done in close partnership with his beloved wife, Mary, and we extend our deepest sympathy to her, and to the entire family. Judge Ellen M. Heller, President Eugene J. Ribakoff, Chairman of the Board Steven Schwager, Executive Vice President
