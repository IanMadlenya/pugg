        DABNEY-Clarence R. We, the Board of Trustees, and the entire Bronx Lebanon Hospital Center family mourn the passing of Clarence R. Dabney. Mr. Dabney's strong leadership as a Board Member of Bronx Lebanon; as Chairman of the Board of the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Health Center; and as Chairman of the Crotona Park Community Mental Health Center, were instrumental in the revitalization of the Bronx community. He also served as a member of Bronx Lebanon's Ambulatory Care Community Advisory Board, as well as the Hospital's Diversity, Quality Assurance, and Finance Committees. Mr. Dabney was widely recognized for his many contributions. His commitment to the Bronx Lebanon cause was absolute and he will always be remembered. We extend our sincere condolences to his family.
