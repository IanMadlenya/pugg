        DEKONINCK - Paul. Paul's colleagues at Thinc Design mourn his untimely death, and extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife Jessica, to his children Isabel and Henry, and to his entire family. Paul was an architect and designer of extraordinary talent, insight and originality who contributed immeasurably to the many museum exhibits and other works which will continue to speak with his voice in the years to come. His wit, sharp intelligence, wisdom and humanity will be sorely missed by his colleagues and clients.
