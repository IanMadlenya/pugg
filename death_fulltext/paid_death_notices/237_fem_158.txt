She was well traveled and enjoyed spending time with family and friends and the occasional weekend in Atlantic City. She is survived by her nieces Carol Ann Gorden of Tempe, AZ, Cathy Elizabeth Carder of Irvine, CA and Bettyjane Godfrey of Long Island, NY and a nephew Donald Tobolson of Long Island, NY. She was the adored great-aunt of Megan and Molly, Jackson and Ellie, Cheryl and Patricia, Sean, Kevin and Kaylee. She will be greatly missed by Irene and Stephen Gardner and family.
