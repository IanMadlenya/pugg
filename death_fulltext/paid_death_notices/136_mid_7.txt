        SOLOMON-Constance Kaufman. The Directors and staff of the Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious Understanding join our esteemed Board member, Adam Solomon, in mourning the loss of his beloved mother. Our hearts go out to his father, Tony Solomon, and the rest of the family. Connie died peacefully after a long illness. She remained spirited, elegant and valiant until the end. She will be greatly missed by all of us who knew and admired her. Georgette F. Bennett, President
        SOLOMON-Constance K. Connie. Inspiration takes flight in a glimpse of a forgotten smile. Clouds passing today encumbering view but not of memories revered. Your willful spirit borne of virtue lives in those you touched. Doubtless, to ever forget you... Joann de Graaf
