        LANDMAN-Sidney James. Customer Service Representative for Villeroy and Boch in New York and a retired professor of English Literature, died in his apartment in Park Slope, Brooklyn, December 18. He was 66. Born August 5, 1934, in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the only son of Sidney Landman and Kathlyn Parker Landman. He earned the Bachelor's Degree from Baylor University and the Doctorate in English from Vanderbilt University before beginning a thirty-year teaching career as a specialist in Shakespeare and Renaissance literature. He taught at Vanderbilt, Texas Christian University and Louisiana Tech University, from which he retired 11 years ago. While teaching at Louisiana Tech, he also earned a Master's Degree in Dramatic Arts and performed in numerous theatrical productions there. Upon his retirement, he moved to Brooklyn and began a second career in retail at the Villeroy and Boch store on Madison Avenue. With an encyclopedic knowledge of historic architecture, interior design, antiques and fine tableware, he rapidly became one of the most successful sales associates, developing a large following among the company's customers. A devotee of the opera, classical music, and theater, he pursued the cultural life of New York with gusto. Mr. Landman was a member of the Empire State Society of the Sons of the American Revolution, the National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors and a benefactor of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. He leaves some cousins and many, many friends. Graveside rites will be conducted on Friday, January 5, at 11:00 A.M. in the Beth-El section of Greenwood Cemetery in Fort Worth. In lieu of flowers, friends may wish to make a donation in Mr. Landman's name to the National Trust for Historic Preservation, 1785 Massachusetts Avenue NW, in Washington, D.C. 20036.
