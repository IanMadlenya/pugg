        ROWE--Catherine (Linville)Sarah Lawrence College mourns the death of Catherine (Kitty) Rowe, a music faculty member from 1969 to 1992. She was a consummate, dedicated voice professor who was unendingly generous with her time and love for her students, returning to teach after retirement until her death. An accomplished singer, pianist and accompanist, she was an advocate of contemporary and avantgarde music and specialist in popular American music, including jazz and the mountain songs of her native Tennessee. As a singer she recorded and toured extensively. She served as a judge at the Metropolitan Opera Regional Auditions. Sarah Lawrence College extends our sympathy to her family. Michele Tolela Myers, President Barbara Kaplan, Dean of the College
