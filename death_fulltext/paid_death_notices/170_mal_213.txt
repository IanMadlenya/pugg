        ABRAMSON-Edward M. Age 65, March 18. Survived by his mother Roslyn, wife Harriet, children Daniel and Deborah, brother David, sister-in-law Ellen, nephew Mark, brother-in-law and sister-in-law Joel and Fran Teisch, nieces Jessica, Rachel, Abby. Loyal friend and adviser to so many. Faced a devastating illness the same way he faced life-with courage, dignity and humor. In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to Project ALS, 511 6th Ave, NYC 10011.
        ABRAMSON-Edward M. Ed-a man whose recreations included climbing mountains-sought the challenge. Although he had opportunities to start his career at any of the Wall Street law firms, Ed, with a goal in mind, took the ''road less traveled'' and joined a firm of four lawyers. Now, forty years later, with the help of Ed's exceptional leadership, we are 130 lawyers and it is still true that, as Ed was wont to say with great pride, ''no partner ever left our firm to practice law at another law firm.'' Ed's last challenge-ALS-was not chosen. Despite increasing difficulty he came to his office. We heard no complaints, no anger; Ed smiled and joked until the last day he was with us. His spirit triumphed. We will respect Ed's wish that we refrain from extended encomiums. Suffice it to say that we shall always honor his memory and appreciate his accomplishments. Ed's family is dear to us, and we extend our deepest sympathies and condolences to his wife Harriet, his children, Dan and Debbie, his mother Roslyn Abramson, his brother David, sister-in-law Ellen, and nephew Mark.
        ABRAMSON-Edward. Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun and its affiliates mourn the passing of our esteemed member. We extend heartfelt sympathy to his devoted and loving wife Harriet, to his loving children, and to the entire bereaved family.
