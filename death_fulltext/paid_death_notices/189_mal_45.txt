        HOCHWALD - Gerald M., MD. Died September 29, 2002. The Trustees, Faculty and Staff of the NYU School of Medicine and the Members of the Department of Neurology mourn the loss of our friend and colleague Gerald M. Hochwald, MD, Professor of Neurology. A distinguished member of the Department for more than 40 years, Dr. Hochwald achieved international recognition for the results of his laboratory studies in the cerebrospinal fluid system, which he and his neurosurgical colleagues at NYU applied in the development of new treatments for infantile hydrocephalus. During this time, he continued to serve as an Attending Neurologist on the wards of Bellevue Hospital, where in his later years, he faithfully conducted daily rounds despite the burdens of physical afflictions. His colleagues remember him for this gallantry and for his many contributions to the field of neurology and extend deepest condolences to his sons Burt, Steven and Neal. Edwin Kolodny, MD, Chairman and the Department of Neurology NYU Medical Center
