        SOLTI-Sir Georg. The Board of Trustees and Staff of Carnegie Hall join the music world in mourning the loss of Sir Georg Solti. One of the world's leading conductors, he played an important role in the history of Carnegie Hall, most centrally with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Recently his influence spread futher through the Solti Orchestral Project, involving 90 young American musicians and key principal players from major American orchestras. We extend our deepest sympathies to Lady Solti and his daughters Claudia and Gabrielle. Isaac Stern, President Sanford I. Weill, Board Chairman Judith Arron, Executive Director
