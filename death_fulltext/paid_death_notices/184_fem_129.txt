        ROSENBERG-Ruth E. Age 87, passed away May 10, in her Manhattan apartment. Ruth enjoyed a long and respected career as an executive secretary at the headquarters of one of the nation's largest textile companies. She was a native New Yorker who loved the City, and would think of living nowhere else. She had a New Yorker's dry and wry wit, and an unfailing sense of style and taste. Ruth and her late husband, Murray, loved discovering restaurants. On Sundays, driving with them to dinner, you never knew where you were going to end up, only that you'd be laughing all the way. Burial will be private. Anyone wishing to share memories can contact her nephew Andy Safir, at 3800 Carbo Court, La Mesa, CA 91941.
