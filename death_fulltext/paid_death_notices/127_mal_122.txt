        GANCHOFF-Moshe Hazzan. The Cantors Assembly notes with sorrow the passing of our teacher, mentor, friend and one of the outstanding luminaries of the ''Golden Age of Hazzanut.'' He was a leading exponent of traditional contemporary Hazzanut. Moshe touched thousands of Jewish souls with his incomparable style of Hazzanut. Our heartfelt condolences go to his beloved Peggy. May his memory abide as a blessing. Henry Rosenblum, President Abraham B. Shapiro, Executive Administrator
