        SMILEY-Irwin. The board of trustees, employees and patrons of the Museum for African Art mourn the passing of our beloved Irwin Smiley, immediate past cochairman of the board of trustees, philantropist, art collector and business executive. Irwin led the museum through its most challenging transition, generously supporting its programs, strengthening its operations, recruiting key executives and enabling it to thrive and serve hundreds of thousands of visitors in New York and in other cities around the world. We will miss him dearly and hope his wife Cecilia and the rest of the Smiley family take comfort in knowing how imporant his contribution has been to New York's cultural and educational landscape.
