        JORDAN-Randy, 33, New York, NY. Bassist, songwriter and arranger Mark Randall Jordan who had been a founding member of the New York based alternative pop band, PAXTON, died peacefully in his sleep on October 30th following a 2 year battle with liver cancer. He was 33 years old. The Lamar, MO native first moved into the national music spotlight in the late 80's with his band ''Donnie and the Rock'' while touring with the ''The Kinks.'' In the early 90's Randy appeared on two widely successful albums with Sony Record's ''The Front'' and ''Baker's Pink'' and had toured extensively throughout The United States and Europe sharing the bill with music superstars including Alice Cooper, Aerosmith, and Lenny Kravitz. In 1995, Mr. Jordan co-founded the band ''PAXTON'' with his close personal friend and confidant Jann Paxton. Although most known for his bass playing, Randy was instrumental in the arranging, mixing and songwriting of the band's recent debut album on Nemperor/Razor and Tie Records and his song ''Which Way Do You Go'' was the band's first release. A private memorial service was held yesterday at the home of Underdog Music, CEO, Christopher H. Browne. In lieu of flowers, it was Mr. Jordan's request that a small contribution be given in his name to God's Love We Deliver or City Meals on Wheels. Mark Randall Jordan was baptized at The Grace Lutheran Church in Lamar, MO and is survived by his mother, Mrs. Erma Lee Jordan and his beloved sister Judy Jordan. He will be missed by all his band mates and fans, past and present. ''Randy was know for his kindness and generosity by all who were privileged to know him. Although his career was short, his talents were highly respected within the recording industry, and his contributions to pop music will continue to touch the hearts and lives of millions.''
