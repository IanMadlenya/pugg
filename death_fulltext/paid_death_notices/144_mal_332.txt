        SCHULHOF-Rudolph B. The Board of Trustees and Staff of The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation deeply mourn the loss of Rudolph B. Schulhof. Ruda and his wife, Hannelore, have been invaluable supporters of the Guggenheim Museum and helped nuture the institution over several decades. Their shared dedication carries on through the continuing role of Hannelore as a charter member of the Peggy Guggenheim Collection Advisory Board. Ruda became a member of the Art & Museum Committee in 1991 and was elected to the Board of Trustees for The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 1993, serving in both of those roles with great distinction. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his wife, to his children, and to his entire family. Peter Lawson-Johnston Honorary Chairman The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation
