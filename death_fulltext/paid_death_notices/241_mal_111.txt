        PLIMPTON--Calvin H. M.D. The Board of Trustees of the American University of Beirut and members of the AUB community note with great sadness the passing of our dear friend and tenth president, Calvin H. Plimpton. Dr. Plimpton served as the universitys president from 1984 to 1987, during one of the most turbulent times in Lebanon's history. He guided AUB through some of its most difficult years, and his leadership of the university will long be remembered. In a 1985 interview with the Christian Science Monitor, Plimpton noted that AUB had survived many major threats and crises in its 120-year history. ''We cannot be political,'' he had said. ''We have to continue to do our business, which is educating people-not indoctrinating, but encouraging them to think for themselves--and let the chips fall where they may.'' We offer our heartfelt sympathy to his wife, Ruth Talbot Plimpton; children, David, Polly, Tom and Edward; and seven grandchildren. Thomas Q. Morris, M.D., Chairman of the Board of Trustees, Dr. John Waterbury, President, American University of Beirut
