        REISS-Hilda. To the sweetest, most lovable wife and mother in the world. For the past 57 years she's been the greatest, most lovable woman that a man could ever have. I didn't deserve her but she was mine. She loved me, took care of myself and my son, was there for me all of the time and was a great friend to me, to my son and to everybody she came in contact with. She listened with a full heart and she gave a full heart for humanity. She gave of herself and she asked for little. She was the best of what humanity has to offer. She was the best mom in the world. For you, I knew that you always loved me more than life itself. I loved you the most, also. I was lucky; I am lucky to have known you. She had the most lovable smile and for me, her husband, she was a pleasure to live with. It's impossible to think that she's not here, but to those who knew her, her spirit touched them and will live on. Alfred Reiss Bart Reiss
