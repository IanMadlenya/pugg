        PITTMAN-Howard. With deep sorrow and affection, we mourn the passing of our dear friend, Howard. Howard was ''one in a million'',''a mench'', always with kindness in his heart and a smile on his face. He will always be remembered. We extend our sincerest condolences and sympathy to Millie and the entire family. Roslyn and Robert Smith

And for that we are grateful. All good things must come to an end. Have a safe journey and may you rest in peace! Millie's children, grandchildren and great grandchildren.
