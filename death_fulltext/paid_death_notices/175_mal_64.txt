        RUCKENS-Irving. The Juilliard community mourns the death of Irving Ruckens, a dedicated and accomplished administrator of the School from 1968 to 1988. After his retirement he and his wife Sylvia provided generous support for many programs at the School. We all extend our deepest sympathy to his wife and family. Joseph W. Polisi, President The Juilliard School
