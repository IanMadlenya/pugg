        ALLEN-Thomas P., August 15, 2000, after an extended illness. He will be lovingly remembered by his wife of 30 years, Carol Allen, by his colleagues at Stuyvesant Square at Beth Israel Medical Center, by many grateful patients, and by his close community of friends. His humor, gentleness and understanding will continue to enrich the world he left.
