        FENTON--Katharine Douglas died May 18 at her home in Pebble Beach, California. Mrs. Fenton, a widow since the death of her husband, Martin, in 1982, was known by her children and grandchildren as one who was always delighted to have them visit and who constantly made an especial effort to entertain them. ''Babe'' Fenton, the daughter of Archibald and Edith Douglas, was brought up in Spuyten Duyvil, in Yonkers. She attended Miss Chapin's School in New York City (as did a daughter and a granddaughter), the Ethel Walker School in Simsbury, Connecticut and Barnard College (her father served as a life trustee of Columbia University of which Barnard is a part). A talented athlete and a fierce competitor, Babe for years held ladies singles titles at the Bedford Golf and Tennis Club in Bedford, New York and later at the Wilmington Country Club in Wilmington, Delaware. Babe was also involved in charitable works; her favorites were her work at the Delaware Hospital and her efforts as a co-founder of the Visiting Nurses' Association chapter in Wilmington. Mrs. Fenton was a member of the Cypress Point Club, Pebble Beach, California, the Vicmead Hunt and Wilmington Country Clubs in Wilmington, Delaware, a life member of the Colony Club in New York City and the Adirondack League Club. She is survived by her five children, Alice and Prudence of Los Angeles, Martin of La Jolla, Edith of New York and Wendell of Chadds Ford, PA, 14 grandchildren and 21 great-grandchildren. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Fenton Chair in Humanities at St. Mark's School, P.O. Box 9105, Southborough, Massachusetts 01772.
