        JEROME--Lucille. The Board of Directors and Staff of Family Services of Westchester note with sadness the loss of Lucille Jerome, matriarch of the Jerome Family, our 2003 Family of the Year. As a founder of Monroe College, Lucille Jerome's life was dedicated to providing educational opportunities for young people and to nurturing potential. That tradition continues today at Monroe College through her son, Stephen, her daughter-in-law Leslie, and her grandchildren, Marc, Evan and Lauren. It will also continue through the Lucille and Harry Jerome Technology Learning Center, established at Family Services of Westchester in 2003 as a result of the Jerome Family's community leadership and generosity.
