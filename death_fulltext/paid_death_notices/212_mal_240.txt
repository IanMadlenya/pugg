Mr. Collier was founder and Chairman of Research Systems Corporation, an Evansville based advertising research organization known across the world a The ARS Group. ''Reg believed in what we wanted to accomplish in the marketing industry, and championed our cause with everything he and his wife Lois had.

Reg went to Evansville in 1961 as a product management director for Mead Johnson & Co, became President and CEO of PAR in 1963, and, in 1974, founded Research Systems Corporation. He was an avid and successful investor in addition to his business pursuits. In 1987, the Colliers built their winter residence, Highgate Farm, where the couple has raised and raced thoroughbreds. Reg fell in love with every foal born. The Colliers have been major supporters of the New York City Trickle Up Program, The Salvation Army, and Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, where they endowed the Lois and Reginald Collier Science Library. They made possible the Roberts Road Project to transform historic houses in facilities for student activities through their extraordinary lead gift. Harvard Business School and Habitat for Humanity were also among their favorite charities, as was The Boys & Girls Club of Evansville. Reg attended Andover Academy, Haverford College, Harvard Business School, and was a US Marine. Reg leaves his wife, Lois Collier, of 54 years, son Mark Collier of Jacksonville, Florida, daughter Brynn Helms of Pine Bush, New York, and four grandchildren.
