        KASMIR-Cyril David, age 52, left this world on August 28, 1997. He was comfortable and surrounded by his family. He chose to leave us when we were all smiling, laughing and basking in the joy that he had brought to all of us. Cyril's strong will and undying spirit will continue to live on in his children Darren, Justin and Sean, and his memory will perpetually provide comfort and guidance to all whom he touched. In addition to his children, he is survived by his loving wife Brenda, his parents Frank and Celia Kasmir, his brother Sam, sister Susan, extended family and many loving friends. Words fail us at this time of great loss, end of suffering, and start of a peaceful rest. We can honor and celebrate a good life, full of passion during which he loved and was loved completely. His youth never left him. Cyril worked tirelessly to provide for his family and to take care of his friends. He was always there for us. He had something to teach us all. His passing will be deeply mourned, yet those who knew him can take solace in the memory of his laughter and of his expressions, both the smiling ones and the stern. He has earned a peaceful rest, yet we're sure he will revel, as he did in life, in the work and the rapture he has ahead. Funeral services will be at 10:00 A.M., Sunday at Sparkman/ Hillcrest Northwest Highway Chapel, Rabbi Gerald J. Klein officiating. Interment following at Hillcrest Memorial Park. The family will receive friends from 4:00 to 6:00 P.M. Saturday in the Funeral Home. In lieu of flowers the family requests memorial contributions be made to the American Cancer Society, 8900 John Carpenter Freeway, Dallas, Texas 75247 or to Dallas Visiting Nurse Assoc., 1440 West Mockingbird Lane, Suite 500, Dallas, Texas 75247.
