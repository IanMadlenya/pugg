        SIMON--Rose. The Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art mourns the death of our dear friend and colleague, Rose Simon. We will cherish the enthusiasm and generosity with which she shared her extraordinary knowledge of 20th century fashion history, and will deeply miss the casual elegance and effortless sophistication that she always brought to our workaday world.
