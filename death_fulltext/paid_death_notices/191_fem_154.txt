        CAROLINE-Dr. Nancy. The National Board of Directors and the Membership of American Red Magen David for Israel record with profound sorrow the passing of Dr. Nancy Caroline in Metulla, Israel. An expert in emergency medical care, she was the pioneer who organized and taught the MDA-Magen David Adom Paramedic Training Program in Israel. As a result of her work and dedication, the MDA paramedics have gained worldwide recognition as being first responders to terrorist attacks. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to her husband, Dr. Lazarus Astrachan; her mother, Zelda Caroline; and her brother, Peter Caroline. May the memories of her life be as a blessing to the family and the people of Israel. Robert L. Sadoff, M.D., Chairman Stuart A. Jackson, Vice Chairman Mark D. Lebow, National President Eugene L. Nagel, M.D., Chairman Medical Committee Benjamin Saxe, Exec. VP
