        HESS-Leon. The Board of Trustees, faculty, and staff of The Rockefeller University mourn the passing of Leon Hess, a steadfast friend for more than 20 years and a former member of the RU Council.

We will cherish his memory. Our deepest condolences to his wife, Norma, and to the entire Hess family. Arnold J. Levine, President Richard B. Fisher, Chairman David Rockefeller, Honorary Chairman The Rockefeller University
