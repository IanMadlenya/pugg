        MILLER-L. Garrison Jr. The Trustees, the Women's Board and the staff of The Boys' Club of New York express their deepest sympathy to the family of their dear friend. He became a Trustee in 1995 and served on several committees including the Committee for Camp Cromwell which was named in honor of his late grandfather and former Boys' Club Trustee, Jarvis Cromwell. Garrison's warmth and good humor will be remembered by us all with deep affection.
