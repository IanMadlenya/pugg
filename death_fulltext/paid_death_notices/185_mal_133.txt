        LOMBARD-Lee, native New Yorker and retired professor of English at Pratt Institute, died of lung cancer in Palm Springs, CA on May 27 at age 88. At age 19, he graduated from CCNY, in 1934 received an MA from Columbia University and in 1949 his PhD from NYU. His doctoral dissertation on African American writers between World Wars I and II was one of the earliest studies of the subject. His teaching career began in Benjamin Franklin High School in Harlem. Later he taught at CCNY Extension Division, Teachers College of Columbia University and Pratt. During World War II, he was an Army interpreter and editor. On various occasions he lectured on African American writers and on Shakespeare on radio station WNYC. After moving to Palm Springs in 1983, he was active in the Palm Springs Tennis Club. When an arm injury ended his tennis playing, he began to devote himself to volunteer work at the Stroke Activity Center in Palm Springs, turning his expertise in the English language into a therapeutic tool to foster the rehabilitation of stroke victims. His class ''Word Power'' attracted the enthusiastic participation of ever-increasing numbers of Stroke Activity Center clients. Dr. Lombard's wife, Jane Wade Lombard, an international art dealer, died in 1996. He is survived by his sisters, Blanche Lombard of Palm Springs, CA and Juliette Lombard George of Stanford, CA, by his brother-in-law Alexander L. George of Stanford, CA, by nieces Leslie Rotstein of Morongo, CA and Mary Lombard Douglass of Edmonds, WA, and by his nephew and namesake, Lee George of Soquel, CA. Contributions in Lee Lombard's memory may be made to the Stroke Activity Center, 2800 Alejo Rd., Palm Springs, CA 92263
