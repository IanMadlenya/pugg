        BLAZER--Walter, age 87, March 10, 2005. He was born January 8, 1918 to the late David and Anna Karper Blazer. He grew up in NYC, where his family settled after fleeing the persecution of Jews in Poland. He became a musician, studying classical voice at Juilliard, only to be interrupted by World War II. He was part of the African invasion. As an Army lieutenant in the 9th Infantry, he was wounded in North Africa. Later he was assigned to psychological warfare in Europe. In Italy he met his wife-to-be, Maria Vernole. They came to America in 1951 and etched out a life in music, supplemented by hard work in a print shop. They raised two children. Walter was a most generous and insightful man, with humor always ready. He followed world affairs closely. He sang with the highest musical standards in the great NY concert halls, and throughout the US and Europe. He was on the voice faculty of the Manhattan School of Music, and taught extensively in Florence, Italy and in the warmth of his home in Montclair, NJ. Walter is survived by his wife, Maria Vernole Blazer, Dickson, TN; his daughter, Judith Blazer, NY, NY; his son and daughter-in-law, Dr. David and Regina Blazer, Dickson, TN; his grandchildren Nikki and Ben Blazer; his sister and brother-in-law, Ruth and Stanley Rosenberg, NY, NY; his nephews and niece, Marnin, David, and Nina Rosenberg. He leaves us with a legacy to be reckoned with. He was a powerful presence and will be deeply missed. In keeping with his wishes, his memorial service will be held at a later date aboard a boat in NY Harbor and his cremains will be ceremoniously scattered in ''his'' beloved Hudson River.
