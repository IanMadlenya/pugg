        WEISSKOPF-Victor. It is with deep sorrow that the American Academy of Arts and Sciences mourns the death of Victor Weisskopf, distinguished physicist, gifted pianist, and President of the Academy from 1976-1979. A leader in the study of quantum mechanics and the structure of the atom, Viki worked tirelessly on behalf of nuclear arms control and EastWest scientific cooperation. As a scientist and humanist, he was enveloped by the ''Knowledge and the Wonder'' of the universe. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Duscha; to his family, and to all those who shared his passion for scientific truth, humanistic insight & international understanding.
