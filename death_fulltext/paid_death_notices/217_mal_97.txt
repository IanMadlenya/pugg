        BOXER--Robert, M.D. The Department of Pediatrics of the Schneider Children's Hospital mourns the loss of our beloved friend and colleague, Robert Boxer, MD. Dr. Boxer was a gifted pediatric cardiologist and intensivist who was totally committed to providing exceptional and compassionate care to his patients. He was a model to be emulated in his clinical commitment to patients and was a talented teacher of fellows, residents and medical students. He was a remarkably kind and warm individual who was loved by all who came in contact with him: physicians, students, nurses, patients and their families. He leaves a remarkable legacy to his colleagues, students and to the thousands of seriously ill children whose lives were affected by his care. His passing leaves a large void in both the medical community and the community at large. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his beloved wife, Harriet Boxer, MD, and hischildren, Joshua and Sarah. Philip Lanzkowsky, MD Executive Director & Chief-of-Staff Schneider Children's Hospital
