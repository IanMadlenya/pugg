        COX--Anne Delafield Finch. The Board of the Friends of Clermont, Clermont State Historic Site, sadly marks the passing of Anne Delafield Finch Cox. She was a member of the Livingston family, many of whose members made substantial contributions to the history both of the Colony and later State of New York and of the American nation during and after the Revolution. The Board salutes Mrs. Cox for her long held interest in, and very generous support of the Friends' activities at the Historic Site.
