        ADAM--Alexander Jay, age 23, adored son of Winky and Laszlo and beloved older brother of Nick and Dash, died peacefully at home in New York City on January 25, 2007, after a two year battle with Ewings Sarcoma. Alex faced his long, painful illness with the same qualities with which he lived his life: courage, humor, grace and intelligence. A proud Old Boy of St. Bernard's School, Alex starred in many plays at Trinity School and Princeton University. He was a talented writer and a two-time winner of the National Scholastic Art & Writing Awards for Humor. We will miss his kindness and empathy as a son, a brother, and a friend, as well as the rare insight and wit with which he regarded the world and his place in it. He was funny. He was charming. He was unique. He touched people in ways that he himself did not fully understand. We will always love him. In addition to his immediate family, Alex is survived by grandparents, aunts and uncles, and many cousins: The Furlaud, Rachofsky and Adam families. A service in his memory will be held at the Church of Heavenly Rest on 5th Avenue at 90th Street, on Friday, February 2nd, at 3pm. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center -Pediatric Division.
