        SHAPIRO-Renate. The New Museum of Contemporary Art family mourns the loss of Renate Shapiro. She was a supportive friend of the Museum from its earliest beginning. Her positive spirit, beauty, and regal demeanor lent credence to the program of the New Museum. The memory of Renate will continue to live in our hearts and minds, renewing itself with the ever-living contemporary art she so loved. The Staff and Board of The New Museum
