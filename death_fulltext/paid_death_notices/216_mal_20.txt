        ORBACH--Jerry. Our heartfelt sympathy and condolences to Elaine and family. We've all lost a dear friend whose friendship knew no boundaries, whose celebrity was worn with graciousness and whose straight talk and story telling fascinated everyone within earshot. Jerry, we will miss the golf and the dinners, the crosswords, the poker and pool stories, but most of all, we are sad not to see those shining eyes and bright smile light up the room as you walked in. We don't have to ''Try to Remember.'' We'll never forget you. Donny and Nancy Carter and family

He was a quintessential New Yorker, definitive master of his craft, and a dedicated humanitarian. On behalf of our Chair and Jerry's close friend, Marty Richards, and our Board of Directors we send our condolences to his beloved wife, Elaine.
