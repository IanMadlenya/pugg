        CARLSON--Kathleen. Project Reach Youth mourns the passing of Kay Carlson. Kay had provided tremendous leadership and assistance to PRY. During her tenure as President of Equitable, then AXA Financial Foundations she had been a strong advocate of youth programs. Her long-standing commitment and guidance to PRY helped to make our AIDS program and college prep program strong models. Kay will be missed tremendously by all the lives she has touched near and far. We extend our condolences. David Puth, Board Chair Mark Gibbel, Board President Robert Madison, Exec. Dir.
