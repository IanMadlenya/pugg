        PEARLSTEIN-Dr. Hillard. The quintessential man, personally and professionally. A man of integrity, loyalty, and uncompromising dedication. Hillard, our 30-year friendship was filled with humor, support and understanding. You were the brother I never had; a wonderful husband, father, son and son-in-law; a friend who gave so much to so many who will be so missed. Rest in peace our Prince of Peace. My sincere condolences to Lee and David and your entire family. Lorraine Goldman
        PEARLSTEIN-Dr. Hillard. An outstanding physician, dermatologist, faithful partner for over 34 years, friend and companion. We spent the years well, but they should have lasted longer. Mourned by his office staff and the dermatology community. Robert Auerbach, M.D.
