Born on October 6, 1928 in St. Benedict's PA, she graduated from St. Michael's High School in Newark, NJ and Seton Hall College. In the early 1950's ''Tess'' was a feature writer for the Newark Sunday News and moderator/co-producer of the teen segment on the Kate Smith Show. Therese is survived by Thomas, her best friend and loving husband of 52 years; daughters Jane G. Nealy, Marie, Susan Gibbons MD and husband Christopher Shumway and her son Michael; granddaughters Chrissy, Katie and Becky; and by dear friend and sister-in-law Mary Farrell, husband Jim and family. Tess shared her warmth, grace, intelligence, wit, joy of life, and profound sense of kindness with those she knew and loved. Her faith in the Lord sustained her. She will live in our hearts forever.
