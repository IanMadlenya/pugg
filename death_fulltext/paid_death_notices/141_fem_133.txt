        GILKESON-Elizabeth C. The Trustees, administration, faculty, staff, students and alumni of Bank Street College of Education mourn the passing of Elizabeth C. Gilkeson. For more than forty years, she played a significant role in developing many of the major programs that characterize the College. As Founding Director of the Bank Street School for Children, an innovative, progressive school serving children from two to thirteen, she developed an approach that is still in action. In the 1960's, she and her colleagues sponsored and administered the Polly Miller Day Care Center, and she directed a National Headstart Demonstration Program at the Early Childhood Family Resources Center. As the Director of the Bank Street component of the then Office of Education's National Follow Through Programs, Mrs. Gilkeson traveled the country to develop & implement the Bank Street approach in fourteen coummunities. After her official retirement in the 1970's, she remained active in both Follow Through and Bank Street College. An innovative leader, her work manifests itself in the educational practices of the students, teachers and administrators with whom she worked. The entire Bank Street community joins together in offering condolences to Mrs. Gilkeson's grandchildren and great grandchildren. Augusta Souza Kappner, President Elizabeth S. Pforzheimer, Chair, Board of Trustees
