        SUSKIND-Ida Levine. It is with great sadness that the Suskind family marks the death of their Matriarch, Ida Suskind. Ida died quietly on January 9 in Bridgehampton, NY, where she moved permanently a few years ago. Ida grew up on Staten Island, where she lived with her late husband, Morris Suskind. She is celebrated by her surviving family: her son, Dennis Suskind, and daughter-in-law, Cynthia, her grandchildren, Jay, Debra, Brian, John, Pamela and Audrey, as well as four great-grandchildren. Her daughter, Lorraine Gootenberg, passed away late last year. Services will be held at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home, 1076 Madison Ave., on Monday, January 13, at 11:30 AM. Contributions in her name may be made to the Bridgehampton Food Pantry, Bridgehampton, NY 11932, or the Arthur Ashe Institute for Urban Health, 450 Clarkson Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11203.
