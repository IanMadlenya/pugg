        MILLER-Israel. Consulate General of Israel in New York and the Mission to the U.N. deeply mourn the passing of Rabbi Israel Miller, a prominent Jewish leader and a true advocate for Israel. Rabbi Miller devoted his life to promote Israel's well being, inspiring many with his wisdom and eloquence. His leadership will be sorely missed. Our condolences to his wife, Ruth, and his children, Michael, David, Debbie and Judy.
