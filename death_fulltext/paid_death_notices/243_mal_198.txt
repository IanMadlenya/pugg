        LEWITT--Sol. The New School and the Board of Trustees mourn the passing of our friend Sol LeWitt. Mr. LeWitt's generous gifts to the University's Art Collection enhance our tradition of the importance of contemporary art in the life of an educated citizenry. His well-known support of younger artists also is a wonderful testament for the new generation of artists and designers studying at the university. We are privileged to be able to benefit from this legacy and live with his vital works of art. Bob Kerrey, President, The New School Philip Scaturro, Chair, Board of Trustees
