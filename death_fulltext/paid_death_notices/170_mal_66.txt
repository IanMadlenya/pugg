        SOLL-Dr. Jerome, 73. The Imagine Project mourns the loss of our mentor, friend and Board member, Jerry Soll. His belief in the innate creativity of all children and his continued faith and confidence in us when there was no one else will be an unending light and inspiration in our continuing quest. He is survived by his beloved wife Ann and his sister Elaine Cheslack. A memorial service will be held Sunday, March 11, 10:30AM, Vanemburgh Funeral Home, Ridgewood, New Jersey.
