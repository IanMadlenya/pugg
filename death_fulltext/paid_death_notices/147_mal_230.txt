        CANTER-Stanley D., 75. April 24, 1999. He was a man of great dignity and modesty, of elegant taste, intellectual clarity and profound generosity. His thoughtfulness, his kindness, his concern for those he loved and who loved him knew no bounds. His passions for music and painting enriched his life andours. The world has lost a rare breed of man.
