        MOHR-Ruth B. The Ackerman Institute for the Family has lost a true friend and cherished colleague. Ruth was a gifted therapist, extraordinary teacher, and valued mentor during her 15 years at Ackerman. She inspired us with her warmth, kindness, humor, and generosity, all of which we will treasure always. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to her children and grandchildren.
