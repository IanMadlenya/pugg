        EISENBUD-Merril, MD. The trustees, faculty and staff of New York University Medical Center deeply mourn the loss of Merril Eisenbud, age 82, Professor Emeritus of Environmental Medicine at NYU School of Medicine. Dr. Eisenbud received international attention for his work on atomic radiation. In the 1960s, he pioneered the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's system for monitoring radioactive fallout from nuclear tests. He was known for his significant work on environmental health. Dr. Eisenbud earned his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering at NYU. In 1968, he led New York City's newly created Environmental Protection Administration, under Mayor John Lindsay. New York's EPA was one of the first agencies of its kind, monitoring air and water resources and waste management. During his tenure at NYU, he was Associate Director of the NYU Institute of Environmental Medicine and Director of the Institute's Laboratory for Environmental Studies. Throughout his career, world leaders sought Dr. Eisenbud's opinions. He served on the United Nations World Health Organization Expert Panel on Radiation, the President's Electromagnetic Radiation Management Council, National Academy of Sciences' National Research Council, National Council on Radiation Protection, and many more international, national, state and city groups. Dr. Eisenbud published more than 200 books and articles, including memoirs called ''An Environmental Odyssey''. He is survived by his wife, Irma; sons, Dr. Elliott, Michael and Frederick; and grandchildren. We express our deep sympathy to his wife and family. E.
