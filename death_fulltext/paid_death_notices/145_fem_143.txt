        GRAY-Esther. The Worldwide Boys Town Jerusalem family mourns the passing of Mrs. Esther Gray, beloved mother of our esteemed Executive Vice President, Rabbi Ronald Gray. Throughout her lifetime, Mrs. Esther Gray derived much nachas from her two exemplary sons, whose commitment to Judaism, communal leadership and charitable endeavors was a source of great pride. And, their ongoing accomplishments will endure as a living and lasting tribute to her memory. We extend heartfelt condolences to Rabbi Gray (and Rachel), Mr. David Gray (and Marilyn) of Florida, and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Josh S. Weston, Chairman Michael J. Scharf, President Rabbi Moshe Linchner, Dean Joan Diamond, Mid-Atlantic Dir. Rabbi Simcha Freedman, Fla. Dir. Denise Gold, Canadian Dir.
