        MATZKA--John. Died peacefully at the age of 82, in La Jolla, California, on March 26, 2006. Born in 1924 in Vienna, Austria, he fled to New York in 1941 and lived 40 years in Hicksville, NY, before moving to La Jolla in 2005. At his retirement, he was Vice-President of Plenum Publishing, NY. He was the beloved husband of the late Lee (Liselotte) Matzka and devoted father of Michael and Peter. He was also the proud grandfather of Liesl and Nathan, and the supportive and caring uncle of Wendy and Sandra Austin, Catherine, Elizabeth and Helen Lederer, as well as beloved brother-in law of Dr. Gerda Lederer. Until his death he cherished the friendships of Patrick Austin and Princess Cosia-Fomba. He was a quiet man of strong principles. We will miss him. No services are to be held. In keeping with his great sense of charitable responsibility, in lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the ACLU.
