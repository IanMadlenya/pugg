        EISENPREIS - Alfred. The Board of Directors of the Cancer Research and Treatment Fund mourn the passing of longtime friend and fellow Board member, Dr. Alfred Eisenpreis. A man of generous spirit and wisdom, he was never reluctant to show his curiosity or express a studied opinion when asked. As a Board member, for more than 30 years, Alfred willingly gave of his time and insights as he did with all his endeavors. He leaves behind many grateful friends who are richer for having known him and his love of life. With regret we bid him farewell as he begins the most exciting journey of all.
