He received his Bachelor's degree in 1936 from Long Island University, then Masters Degrees in Psychology and Social Work from Columbia University and his M.D. from Edinburgh University in 1949. He completed his training in Psychoanalysis at the New York Medical College in 1956. He was a psychiatrist for the past 50 years and still in practice. He had an incredible love for the world, for all people, for his friends, and professional associates as well as his patients, and his family. He was so very active and interested in the beauty and the complexities of the world. Our dad, husband, and friend surely will be greatly missed.
