        DORAN-Eamonn. The Board of Trustees, the Sisters of Charity, the staff and the entire New York Foundling Hospital family, mourn the loss of our beloved friend, Eamonn Doran. Eamonn's devotion to the Foundling began in 1980 with the first Eamonn Doran Golf Classic. Through Eamonn's untiring efforts and boundless energy over the last 17 years, public awareness and significant funds were raised for the children and families that the Foundling serves. With Eamonn's passing, the world is a less warm and friendly place and he will be greatly missed by all who knew him. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Clare, his sons, Dermot and Edward, his family and his many friends on their profound loss.
