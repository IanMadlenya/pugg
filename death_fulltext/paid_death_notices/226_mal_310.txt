        WEIR--Maurice. Our beloved friend died in Palm Beach November 21 at age 92. He was unable to survive a cancer operation of six weeks ago. An interior designer in practice for over fifty years, he was a distingushed Fellow of the ASID, highly respected by his colleagues and clients, and deeply loved by his friends. We shall miss his humor, generosity, and warm friendship. Bob, Bob and Bobbie
