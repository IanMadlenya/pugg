She had been a Principal Librarian with the NY Public Library and a Director of Information for the US Information Agency in Japan. After retirement, she became an advocate for women and the elderly, serving as a member of the executive board of the Global Alliance for Women's Health. For over two decades she represented GAWH, the PanPacific and Southeast Asia Women's Association and the International Federation on Ageing at the United Nations.
