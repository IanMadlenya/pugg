        de ALMEIDA-Antonio. The Nestle Corporation and the musicians and staff of the Moscow Symphony Orchestra mourn the loss of their beloved Music Director, Antonio de Almeida. Maestro de Almeida had the courage to come to us at a time of grave national turmoil. His unflagging faith in the universal language of music and his devotion to the musicians of the Moscow Symphony Orchestra and their families shall forever be remembered.
