        STERN-Mark. The Queens Jewish Center of Forest Hills, NY, expresses a profound sense of loss and sorrow at the passing of one of its pillars, Mark Stern, of blessed memory. While never holding any official office, he was profoundly involved in every aspect of communal life. He will be terribly missed and remembered for his innumerable acts of kindness and caring over more than four decades. Our condolences to his children Mr. and Mrs. Leon Stern, Mr. and Mrs. Norman Stern, Mr. and Mrs. Yoram Levy and his seven grandchildren. Rabbi Joseph Grunblatt Steven J. Lerner, President Franklyn Snitow, Chrm. of the Bd.
