        RICHARDS--Lloyd. The faculty, staff, students and alumni of Yale School of Drama and Yale Repertory Theatre mourn the loss of our esteemed Professor Emeritus and former Dean and Artistic Director. Lloyd was a distinguished teacher, ground breaking director, producer and champion of playwrights. He will be remembered for his extraordinary dedication to supporting emerging voices, and leaves the theatre an unparalled legacy. Our deepest sympathies to his wife Barbara and sons, Scott and Thomas. James Bundy, Dean and Artistic Director Victoria Nolan, Deputy Dean and Managing Director
