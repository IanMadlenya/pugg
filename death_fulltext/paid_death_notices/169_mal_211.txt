        CAMPBELL-Douglass. We have known Douglass from the viewpoint of friends and office colleagues for many years and knew him as a person that belonged to another age; yet one who had a timeless, gentlemanly dignity. His love of life kept him buoyant. He was unique for his many passions ranging from opera and theater, to raising orchids and collecting the rare and beautiful. He had an exceptional engagement in both charitable causes and current events, and had an appreciation for an ardent conversation about politics. Although he was a steadfast Republican, his attitude to those few of us Democrats in the office was an amusing ''de gustibus non disputandum est''. Or, in plainer words, there is no accounting for bad taste. We will miss his presence in the office greatly. Alpha Finance Resource Holdings
