        GILL-Anne Barnard. The Board of Trustees and the Staff of the Whitney Museum of American Art note with great sadness the passing of our beloved friend, Anne Barnard Gill. Anne was a founding member of the Museum's National Committee and a longtime supporter of the Whitney Museum. Along with her late husband, Brendan Gill, Anne combined wit and wisdom in a spirited support of American art and artists. We extend our deepest sympathy to her children and family. Maxwell L. Anderson, Director Flora Miller Biddle Honorary Trustee Joel S. Ehrenkranz, President Leonard A. Lauder, Chairman
