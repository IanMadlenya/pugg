        YANOVER-Gail R. We mourn the passing of our colleague, Gail Yanover, RN, MS. Expert clinician, teacher, leader, and steward, Gail was our partner at Mount Sinai for over 32 years. She advocated with determination and wisdom for improvement in the environments of care for patients and families as well as the nurses who serve Mount Sinai's many communities. We extend our deepest sympathy to her brother Jerald Yanover, sister Judith Elman and Gail's entire family. Thomas Smith, RN Vice President, Nursing on Behalf of the Mount Sinai Community of Nurses
