Morgan for 54 years, who predeceased her in 1988, she imbued her loving daughters, Mimsi (Mrs. Laurence Bodkin), and Martha (Mrs. J. Kevin Kenny), and her devoted son, Alfred III, with her unique sense of values, of justice and compassion, and a remarkable sense of humour. One of five children of Mr. and Mrs. William Stafford of Brooklyn, Huntington, and Palm Beach, only her loving sister Greta Brady survives her. Among her greatest joys are counted her twelve grandchildren, five great grandchildren, and devoted nieces and nephews, all of whom were in her company close to the time of her passing.
