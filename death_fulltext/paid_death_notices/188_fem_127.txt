        SIROTA-Barbara. The Officers, Trustees and Congregation of Temple Emanuel of Great Neck mourn the tragic and untimely passing of Barbara Sirota, whose perceptive wit coupled with her warm and caring nature made an indelible impression on all whose lives she touched. An active member of the synagogue for many years, she served with distinction on the board as recording secretary, and chaired the Religious School and Youth Committees. Her concern for the needs of our children was matched only by the sincere joy that she took, duly noting their progress and celebrating their milestones. She was a devoted wife and loving mother who made no secret of her delight in her most recent role of grandmother. All of us at Emanuel, congregants and staff, will miss the smiling face that announced her ongoing readiness to support our efforts. May her memory be a blessing. Dr. Robert S. Widom, Rabbi Mandell Dalis, President
        SIROTA-Barbara. Our dear friend forever. She will be sorely missed. The Gershenson Family
