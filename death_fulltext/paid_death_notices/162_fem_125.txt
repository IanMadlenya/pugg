        JAMES-Debra. It is with the deepest sadness that we mourn loss of our beloved friend and valued colleague, Debra James. Debra served this University with dedication and distinction for 25 years, most recently as a Senior Vice President. She helped create and guide some of its most important enterprises. However, she will be best remembered for her constant efforts to create a sense of community at NYU and to provide it with a heart. She worked tirelessly to convey a sense of family and closeness among students, faculty and staff. She was a champion of our community service programs, binding this institution with its neighborhood and leading its efforts to help those in need. She helped create the vision of what this Univeristy could be. Her parting came far too soon; she will be sorely missed. L. Jay Oliva, President
