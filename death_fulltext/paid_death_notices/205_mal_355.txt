        AXELROD -- Albert. The membership and the Board of the Fencers Club mourn the loss of Albert Axelrod, 1960 individual foil olympic bronze medalist, Director Emeritus and member for over four decades. Albie was one of the greatest competitors of his or any generation, whose results as a foilist have yet to be surpassed. His contributions--as a coach, team leader and manager, and editor of ''American Fencing''-are hallmarks of his lifelong dedication to our sport. We offer our heartfelt condolences to Henrietta, his wife of 60 years and his entire family.
