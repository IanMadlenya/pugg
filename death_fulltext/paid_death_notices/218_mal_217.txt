        BLECHNER--Norbert. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Hannah Blechner, Mark Blechner, Barbara Sevde, Jane Bressler and grandchildren on the passing of their beloved husband, father, and grandfather. He served as an exemplary role model to everyone around him in his humility, dignity and honesty. As a Golden Founder of the Medical Center, together with Hannah, Norbert's generous support over the years helped the mission of the Medical Center to heal the sick and ease the pain of the afflicted. May the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. American Committee for Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem
