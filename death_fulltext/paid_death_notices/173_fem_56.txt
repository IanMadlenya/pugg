        HAMOY-Judith Lisa nee Cohen. April 25, 1950-June 4, 2001 in California. Beloved daughter of the late Franklin Cohen. Survived by her mother, Selma, her sister Diane R. Davis. Judi graduated from Queens College Cum Laude in 1973. Judi, we hope you are at peace at last. You waged a heroic fight against the depression that finally over took you. You were a gifted teacher and a fine musician. You will be remembered always by those of us who loved you. A memorial service is planned for a later date.
