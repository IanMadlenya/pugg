        LaBARBERA-Priscilla. We deeply mourn the loss of Priscilla LaBarbera, Professor of Marketing and Teaching Excellence Professor at New York University Stern School of Business who passed away Novemeber 3, 2000 following a long and valiant struggle with cancer. Born and raised in Queens, N.Y., Professor LaBarbera graduated from the City University of New York in 1972, serving as valedictorian of her class. She earned her MBA and PhD degrees from Michigan State University, graduating with honors. Priscilla joined the Stern School as Assistant Professor of Marketing in 1976. During her academic career she also held positions at the White House Office of Consumer Affairs and in the private sector. She was the recipient of many honors and awards for scholarship and service, including the Distinguished Teaching Medal from New York University. Her scholarly work on advertising response measurement and industry self-regulation has had a great impact on the way advertising agencies operate today. She has left the lives of those who knew her richer for her presence. Her energy, enthusiasm and boundless optimism served as a source of inspiration for all of her colleagues and students. Her commitment to community service and to those in need formed an integral part of her life. The memory of the nobility of her spirit will long give strength to all of those whose lives she touched, especially the generations of Stern students she taught, mentored and cherished. We extend our deepest sympathy to her family, especially her mother and her loving husband and devoted friend Dr. Robert Blake. Visitation for Professor LaBarbera will continue on Tuesday at the Perazzo Funeral Home, 199 Bleeker St., from 2pm-5pm and 79:30pm. Funeral Mass is Wednesday, 9:30am at St. Anthony's Church, Sullivan and Houston. A Memorial Service will be held at the Stern School later this year.
