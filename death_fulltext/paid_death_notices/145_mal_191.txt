        BUXTON-Jorge N. It is with great sorrow and a profound sense of loss that the New York Eye & Ear Infirmary mourns the death of Dr. Jorges N. Buxton, a Fellow Alumnus and internationally distinguished Ophthalmologist whose forte was in diseases and surgery of the cornea. In 1986, he was honored as the Distinguished Alumnus of the Year. His extensive curriculum vitae is a tribute to his involvement in the practice and study of Ophthalmology. We express our condolences to his wife Amalia and sons George and Douglas.
