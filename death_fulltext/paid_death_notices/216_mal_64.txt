        MILLER -- Richard McDer mott. National Sculpture Society (NSS) mourns the loss of renowned sculptor, and friend ''Dick'' Miller, who died at St. Vincent's Hospital on Christmas Day. Known as The Figure Sculptor of SoHo, he became an elected member of the NSS in 1977, and served as President from 1997 to 2000. Miller was one of the Society's most distinguished and influential leaders, guiding the organization into the 21st century. We are deeply grateful for his wisdom, support, and leadership. We extend our sympathies to his wife, Gloria, and family.
