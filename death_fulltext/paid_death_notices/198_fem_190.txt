        HAMENT--Frances. Of Great Neck, NY. Fran, beloved wife of the late Gus Hament passed away unexpectedly on July 26, 2003. She leaves behind her children Tina, Winnie, Billy (predeceased), Daniel, Nancy and Barbara; an extended family of spouses, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, unofficial foster children and an abundance of adoring friends. Fran was a woman with an open heart who adopted a lot of people along the way. She was a woman with a style all her own. Her warmth of spirit pervaded a life full of everyday experiences. At every turn, she turned toward life, toward her family and especially toward people who needed her gentle manner and deep wisdom. There was always ''room for one more'' in Fran's world. She will be sorely missed by the many lives she shared and touched. Services will be held at Riverside-Nassau North Chapel, 55 North Station Plaza, Great Neck, 2 p.m., Monday, June 28. The family will sit shiva at the home of Tina Hament and Patrick Silvestri in Glen Cove. >>AD#
