        ERLANGER--Elisabeth. The Board of Directors, Members and Staff of The Rogosin Institute mourn the loss of Elisabeth Erlanger, Director of Public Relations at RI for over fifteen years. She was extremely talented, dedicated and caring during her years working at The Institute, as well as during her previous tenure with The New York Hospital. We extend heartfelt sympathy to her children and family.
