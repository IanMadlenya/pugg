        SIEGEL -- Benjamin. The Abraham Joshua Heschel School Community notes with great sorrow the passing of Benjamin Siegel, father of our devoted Trustee Seth M. (Yossi) Siegel, father-in-law of Rachel Ringler and grandfather of alumni Alana '97, Samuel '01 and current student Talia '05. Benjamin Siegel was devoted to his synagogue and Jewish heritage. Many of his values were passed down to Yossi who exhibits devotion to so many causes and is an untiring, energetic life force who has benefited the Heschel School Community in so many ways. We extend our condolences to the entire Siegel family. May you be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Alisa R. Doctoroff, President Roanna Shorofsky Head of School
