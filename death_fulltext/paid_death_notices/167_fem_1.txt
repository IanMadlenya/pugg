        COVAL-APEL-Dr. Naomi Miller. A noted New York dentist who did pioneering work on tempro-mandibular joint dysfunction and later specialized in orthodontics, died November 24 after a long illness at her home in Glen Cove, Long Island. She was surrounded by her husband, Robert Apel, and her three children Ilya, Payson and Larry. Dr. Coval-Apel's dental practice spanned 47 years. She received her BA from the University of Chicago in 1939 and her DDS from Columbia University in 1943. In order to encourage women to have a career in dentistry, she lectured frequently to many professional organizations around the world. She received numerous awards, including one from the Oral Hygiene Committee of Greater New York and also from the British Society for the Study of Orthodontics. She was past-president of the Five Towns Auxiliary of Peninsula General Hospital; Vice President of Five Town B'nai Brith; President of Five Towns American Jewish Congress and many other organizations. Dr. Coval-Apel was also an accomplished sculptor, jeweler, and poet. All the vicissitudes of youth, all the stresses of building a career, all the agonies of rearing children are worth the journey, when one sails towards the finishing line with a magnificent spouse who is one's best friend.
