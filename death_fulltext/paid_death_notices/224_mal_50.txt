        FRANZ--Samuel Stephen. The Franz family mourns the loss of Samuel Stephen Franz, devoted husband to Marilyn Hodor Franz for 47 years, beloved father to Marc, Peter and Eric Franz, proud grandfather to Rachel, Samantha, Zachary, Jake, Aviva and Maxwell Franz. Sam was and is a man of great honor; a man of strength and integrity; a man who delivered joy and comfort to all who crossed his path. He will be missed by all and cherished forever. Consistent with his legacy, in lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to a charity of your choice to assist the survivors of Hurricane Katrina. ''Reach for the stars, settle for the moon, walk away with a smile'' --this is Sam's mantra and we will all remember it as we gaze upon the stars in search for his guidance. Services were held on September 7, 2005.
