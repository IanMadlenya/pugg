        POCZIK-Regina. It is with tears and profound sorrow that we mark the passing of Reggie, our first class lady, whose warmth, devotion to her family, dignity, grace and courage throughout, made all of us who knew her feel special and realize she was special. What she imparted to each of us will keep her alive in our memories. To Donald, her husband, and our friend and partner, and Evan and Susan, her children, we extend our heartfelt sympathy. We are truly there for you. Your extended family, The Partners-All of Us
