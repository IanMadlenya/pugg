        GAILMOR-Elaine, 84. Of Westport, Connecticut, died December 2, in Florida. An Honors graduate in sociology at NYU she served many years as the Administrator of the Miquon School, an innovative, progressive private elementary school in Miquon, PA. A tireless crusader for peace and human rights, she thrived on lively political dialogue, peppered with humor. She was predeceased by her husband, William S. Gailmor, a journalist and popular news commentator in New York whose radio career was aburptly ended by the Blacklist in the late 1940's, and a brother Robert E. Pantell. She is survived by her daughter and sonin-law Wendy and David Newton of Weston, Connecticut; her son Jon Gailmor, daughter-in-law Cathy Murphy, and grandchildren Aaron, Maya and Micaela, of Lake Elmore, Vermont; and her companion of many years Richard Temko. Characteristically, a few days before her death, she commented on the post-election Florida fiasco: ''If I'd been up and around, none of this would have happened.'' She will be missed.
