        LICALZI--Michael. On behalf of HELPUSA and our founder, Andrew Cuomo, we would like to express our deepest condolences to Greg and Carol Licalzi, and their children, Gregory, Luke and Elizabeth. Their son and brother, Michael, a patriot, died in Iraq in the service of his country. We also offer our condolences on behalf of the thousands of formerly homeless families whom Greg Licalzi helped as a key member of HELPUSA's founding team. Maria Cuomo and Larry Belinsky
