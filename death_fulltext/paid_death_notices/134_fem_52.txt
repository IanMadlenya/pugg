        HABER-Fannie. The entire ORT world mourns the passing of Fannie Haber of Ann Arbor, MI., wife of the late Dr. William Haber, a past president of both American ORT and World ORT. She would have been 99 years old later this month. She was, in her own quiet way, most helpful to ORT as she visited most of the ORT schools and other operations on all five continents. In addition, she was the organizer of the UJA of Ann Arbor, a founder of Delta Phi Epsilon Sorority at the University of Michigan, an active member of League of Women Voters. We extend our condolences to her sons, Professor Ralph Haber and Allen. American ORT Paul Borman, President Brian J. Strum, Executive Vice-President Paul I. Bernick, Executive Director Emeritus Women's American ORT Ruth S. Taffel. President Pepi Dunay, First Vice President Rosina K. Abramson, Esq., Executive Director World ORT Union Justice Richard Goldstone, President Dr. Ellen Isler, Director General
