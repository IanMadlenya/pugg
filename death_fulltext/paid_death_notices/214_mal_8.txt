        HEINE--Leonard M. Jr. The following e-mail was twice sent to Leonard on June 6, 2004, the 60th anniversary of the Normandy invasion. He repeatedly refused to acknowledge receipt and in so doing, only affirmed Tom Brokaw's insight into that generation. ''Leonard: Nancy and I are, at this moment, flying over the Alps and peering down on a tranquil Europe. It is manifest that we and our sons are reaping what you had long ago sown with the currency of your youth. And for that, we will simply say, thank you.'' Our love to Sandy and the children. Robert and Nancy Englander
