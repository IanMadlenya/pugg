        SHARP-Evelyn. The Board of Trustees and staff of The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation mourn the loss of Evelyn Sharp. Mrs. Sharp was a devoted and generous patron of the Guggenheim Museum and donor to the collection. She brought a keen eye and discriminating intelligence to the appreciation of art, as demonstrated by her oustanding collection of modern masters. We extend our sympathy to her daughter, Mary Sharp Cronson, Trustee of The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, and to her family. Peter Lawson-Johnston Chairman The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation
