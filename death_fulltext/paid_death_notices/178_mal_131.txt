        SILVERMAN-Frederick, M.D. The faculty of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, express their deep sorrow on the death of their esteemed colleague Dr. Frederick Silverman. Dr. Silverman did his residency training in Obstetrics and Gynecology at this hospital and was a member of the attending staff and the teaching staff from 1962 until his retirement in 1998. As Clinical Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology, he was a respected and valued teacher of medical students and residents because of his enthusiasm and the depth of his clinical knowledge. His presence will be sorely missed. Frank A. Chervenak, M.D., Chairman and Given Foundation Professor, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology William J. Ledger, M.D. Professor and Chairman Emeritus, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, Weill Medical College of Cornell University
