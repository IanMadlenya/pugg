        SHIMANSKY-Max, Hazzan. The Cantors Assembly records with sorrow the passing of a respected colleague of over three decades. Quietly and gently, he served the spiritual needs of his congregants with great dignity, warmth and care. We extend our sympathy to his wife Sharon, his children and his loved ones. May his memory abide as a blessing. Hazzan Henry Rosenblum, Pres. Hazzan Stephen J. Stein, Exec. VP
