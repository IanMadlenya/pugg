        LOEB--Scott. Is it with great sadness the entire Woodcrest Club family mourns the passing of little Scott Loeb who lost his battle with cancer. We extend to Debbie, Larry and Brett our condolences on the lost of this tough little boy. The grandson of longtime members Phyllis and Bob Tunick, and nephew of Sandy and Jason Kroll was an inspiration to us all. His happy face and smile will be missed by us all. Our deepest sympathies to the entire family. David E. Beller, President Board of Governors The Woodcrest Club
