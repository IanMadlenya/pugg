        DUBROWIN--Raphael, 91, on January 30, 2005. Formerly of Hartsdale, NY, Ray and his beloved Bernice moved to San Diego, CA in 1988. He graduated from NYU and NYU Law School, served in the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps (receiving Legion of Merit Citation), and had retired after 40 years in the fine leather goods business. He was a Commodore of the Beach Point Yacht Club and member of the Scarsdale Golf Club. Bernice and his daughters, Ellen (of Oakland, CA) and Sandy (of Richmond, CA) will miss his sweetness, his eloquence, and his brilliant sense of humor.
