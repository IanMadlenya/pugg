        OSSIAS--Charles Matthew, known to his friends as Matthew, was born on November 25, 1916 and lived a wonderful life in New York City, including childhood on Mosholu Pkwy in the Bronx and for over 50 years in Kew Gardens, Queens. Matthew was a graduate of Townsend Harris High School and held a Master's Degree in Education and Science from City College. He was a man of ethics and intellectual curiosity who spoke several languages including English, French, Spanish, Italian, Yiddish and Hebrew and had a lifetime love of history, Judaism, economics and religion. Matthew Ossias was reform Jew who was strongly committed to the ideals of Judaism as well as a pacifist and vocal advocate of non violence. For over 60 years, Matthew was committed to the philosophy and economic principles of Henry George, the 19th century reformer who, in his landmark book ''Progress and Poverty,'' decried the disparity between rich and poor and proposed the highly regarded theory of a single tax on land value to cure this and other social ills. Matthew served on the Board of Directors of the Henry George School of Social Science where for several years he headed the international correspondence division and taught the principles of ''Progress and Poverty.'' Among his achievements, Matthew brought the Georgist philosophy to people all over the world through the distance - learning program and by translation of the Progress and Poverty course into French, Spanish, Italian and, with the assistance of his wife Fryda L. Ossias, Haitian Creole. Matthew and Fryda were married at the New York Society of Ethical Culture on June 21, 1951 and were happily married for 55 years. Charles Matthew Ossias will be sorely missed and remembered by many friends and family, including his brother Abner, sons Robert & Stanley, daughtersin-law Madeline & Mable, grandchildren Emily, Harrison & Julian and his wife of 55 years, Fryda L. Ossias.
