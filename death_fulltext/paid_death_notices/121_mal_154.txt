        McCARTHY-Fr. John. The students, alumni, faculty and administrators of the Fordham University Graduate School of Social Service mourn the loss of our beloved and dedicated Jesuit professor. Fr. John McCarthy lived his Jesuit and social work values in his teaching and in his volunteer work with underprivileged youth. We will miss him. We express our profound sympathies to Fr. McCarthy's fellow Jesuits and to members of his family. Mary Ann Quaranta, Dean
