        NAPOLI-Nate (Natale). May 21, 1910-November 15, 1997. Living is what he loved. Giving is what he did. Love is what he got. He had no complaints as he traveled the highway of life taking us along with him. It was a great trip for those of us who really knew him. A part of us is gone, yet a part of him will always live on. He will be forever loved and respected. Viewing at the Fairchild Funeral Home, Manhasset, LI, Tuesday. Funeral mass at St. Mary's Church, Roslyn, LI. In lieu of flowers, donations to the Diabetes Foundation or the American Heart Association would be appreciated.
