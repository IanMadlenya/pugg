        FREUND -- Richard. Dick Freund, representing ABC, often sat across the table from the Writers Guild of America, East in bitter negotiations. In all the years he did so, he was never less than honest, candid and understanding. He did his best for ABC, but always with honor and civility. We deeply regret his passing. Writers Guild of America, East, Inc. Herb Sargent, President Mona Mangan, Exec. Dir.
