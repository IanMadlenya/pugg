        COHEN-Haskell, a pioneer in the world of basketball, was the firstever contributing editor to PARADE magazine and the creator of its long-standing All-America High School sports teams. Mr. Cohen's influence in the sport of basketball is historic. As public relations director for the National Basketball Association, he created the annual NBA All-Star Game, brought the first television contract to the NBA and started the Maurice Stokes Memorial Game, which benefits indigent former NBA players. Mr. Cohen came to PARADE in 1957, where he created the All-America High School Boys Basketball Team-the first in history-a precedent that has been copied throughout the years. In 1963, he instituted the PARADE All-America High School Football Team, followed by the All-America Girls Basketball Team in 1977, boys soccer in 1979, and girls soccer in 1993. Walter Anderson, chairman, publisher and CEO of Parade, said ''Haskell Cohen should be remembered not only as a pioneer of high school and professional sports, but also as a man who cared deeply about the well-being of America's young athletes and everyone he came in contact with. His memory should be honored and respected accordingly. He was an American original and a great sportsman. We will miss him.''
