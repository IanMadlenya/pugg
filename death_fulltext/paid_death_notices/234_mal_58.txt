        KORNBLATT--Samuel. A man of principle and honor, his word was his bond. A devoted husband and caring father and grandfather. We express our sincere condolences to Donna, the children, the grandchildren and the Kornblatt Family. Donna, we salute you. You could not have been a more wonderful wife or support system.
