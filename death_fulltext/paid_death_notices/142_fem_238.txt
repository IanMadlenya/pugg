        FELDMAN-Elane. We mourn the loss of a dear and courageous friend and altogether wonderful human being. A talented writer and publicist, she was the author of ''Going Bananas''; ''The Writer's Guide to Self-Promotion and Publicity'' and ''Fashions of a Decade: The 1990's.'' Our hearts go out to Dan, her loving and devoted husband of almost 35 years. Memorial service Monday, November 30, 1 PM, at Congregation Mount Sinai, Brooklyn Heights. Barbara and Abe Habenstreit
