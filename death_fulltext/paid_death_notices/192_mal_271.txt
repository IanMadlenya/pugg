        McDONALD-John Charles. Of Brooklyn Heights, died of cancer on January 20, 2003. He was 76 years old. Mr. McDonald distinguished himself by virtue of his wit and grace. He served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and went to Georgetown and Harvard Law School, graduating with the highest honors. Following graduation, he spent several years at the law firm of Mudge-Rose before devoting himself full-time to trademark law in a long career with Sterling Drug. He eventually headed the United States Trademark Association before retiring in 1990. Upon retirement, Mr. McDonald finally had the chance to pursue his greatest interest, the theater. He was passionately committed to The Acting Company in its support and training of young actors in the classical tradition. He was a Vice-President of The Acting Company and an active member of Grace Church, Brooklyn Heights and a member of the Vestry at the time of his death. His presence-and love-will be greatly missed. He is survived by his wife, Louanna O. Carlin, and by the children of his late wife, Bettie McDonald, their son, David, their daughter and son-in-law, Martha and Patrick Goupit, and grandson, Max Goupit. He also is survived by the families of his step-children Will Carlin, Mercer Carlin and Alison Carrabba. Contributions in lieu of flowers should be made to Grace Church, Brooklyn Heights or The Acting Company. A memorial service will be held Saturday, January 25th, at 11:00 AM at Grace Church, 254 Hicks Street, Brooklyn Heights.
