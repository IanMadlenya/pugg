        DALY--Marie, Ph.D. Albert Einstein College of Medicine notes with profound sorrow the passing of Dr. Marie Daly, a member of our department of biochemistry for more than 25 years. A distinguished scientist, and believed to be the first African-American woman to receive a Ph.D. in chemistry (Columbia University, 1948), her research on histones, with colleagues at the Rockefeller Institute, was seminal. She joined Einstein in 1960 where her research continued to flourish, focusing on cholesterol metabolism and creatine uptake by cells. In addition to her impressive scientific career, Dr. Daly was actively involved in the recruitment and training of minority students at Einstein and is warmly remembered as a creative and involved teacher. Our sincere condolences to her family. Dominick P. Purpura, M.D. The Marilyn and Stanley M.
