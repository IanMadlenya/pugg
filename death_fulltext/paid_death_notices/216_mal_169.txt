        ROSENBERG--Barry, was a remarkable friend. He always found the good in people and could sense when another was in need; he had the energy and right words to help. He sincerely believed anything was possible if people could reason together. Barry and Madge's love for each other and their children is a wondrous example. We will miss him. Barry's reading group.
