        HAUSMAN--Leo. What a glorious man and what a glorious life. Leo saw health problems and tried all his life to not merely ameliorate those problems, but sought every possible method to eliminate them. He gave of his money. He gave of his time. But most importantly he gave of himself and enthused others to do the same. He was never satisfied with status quo. He was a rare human being: both a dreamer and a doer. I've spent over 20 years at his side and was always amazed at his energy, his drive and his gentleness. He will forever be missed. Jerome & Maxine Belson
        HAUSMAN--Leo. The Officers and the Board of United Cerebral Palsy of NYC note with deep sorrow the passing of our Board Chairman, Leo Hausman. Active in the organization since 1958, his guidance has led UCP/NYC to become the largest provider of health and program services for people with severe disabilities in New York City. We extend our sincere sympathy to his children, Martin and Helaine Hausman and Jane and Richard Karp, and their entire family. Edward R. Matthews Executive Director UCP of NYC, Inc.
        HAUSMAN--Leo. To our dearest ''Poppy'' Leo, you will always be a star to us. We treasure your unflagging spirit, tireless energy and zeal for life. We hope and pray to have lives like yours, filled with wonder, adventure and love.--Helene, Jamie, Sam, Levi, Jesse and Kobe
