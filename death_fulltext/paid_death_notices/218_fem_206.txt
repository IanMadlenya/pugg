        SILVERSTEIN -- Audrey, a Gracious Lady, intelligent, beautiful and charitable, passed peacefully from our lives March 21, 2005. She left us with a lifetime of memories, full of laughter, joy, kindness and friendship. She was more to us than a sister-inlaw and aunt. Together with her late husband, Lawrence, she was an inseparable part of every important event in our lives. We share the grief felt by her children and grandchildren. We will always treasure her memory. Ariel and Leon Mandel Mary and Joel Mandel Hinda and Howard Abramoff Joyce and David Currier
