        LEUBSDORF-Bertha Boschwitz. Died at the age of 90 on July 17, 1998. Dear wife of the late Karl Leubsdorf, caring mother of Carl and John Leubsdorf, proud and loving grandmother. Trained as a mathematician at a time when few women entered that field, with degrees from Hunter College and Columbia University, she devoted herself for many years to volunteer service for those in need. She was President of the Hunter Scholarship and Welfare Fund, Board member of the Hunter College Foundation, receiving an honorary degree from Hunter. She was also Secretary and Trustee of the Hospital for Joint Diseases, and President of that hospital's Women's Auxiliary. She loved all the arts, and was glad to have endowed the Karl and Bertha Leubsdorf Gallery at Hunter. Her family and friends will remember her as witty, capable, cultured, active, generous, devoted, and a good friend. Funeral service 11:30 AM, Monday, July 20, at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81 Street. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to Hunter Scholarship and Welfare Fund, 695 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10021-5085.
