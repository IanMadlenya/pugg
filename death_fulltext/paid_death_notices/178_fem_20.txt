        ROTHSTEIN-Freyda (aka Freddie Simon). Died in her sleep on October 28th, 2001 in Venice, Italy while on a cruise. She is survived by her two sons, Aron and Daniel. She had a performing career as a folk singer on her own radio program on WNYC, and as half the folk singing duo, ''Frey and Martin''. A graduate of The High School of Music and Art and Carnegie Mellon University, she was one of the first women to have produced a daytime drama serial, and moved on to become an executive at Paramount Television. She served as Vice President of Network Development for David Susskind at Talent Associates and Time/Life Productions before moving to Los Angeles and establishing ''Freyda Rothstein Productions'', executive producing over 40 television movies, many based on true stories, often controversial. ''Crisis at Central High'', the story of integration at the high school in Little Rock, won a Christopher Award and an Emmy nomination. In 1990 she affiliated with Hearst Entertainment, maintaining a successful career decades past the age considered employable in this youth dominated medium. Nothing stopped her-not being a senior citizen, not having a leg amputated in 1997 as a result of vascular disease. In 2001, she made two movies for ''Lifetime''''Dangerous Child'' and ''Snap Judgement''. In addition to her impressive television credits, she was known as a quilt collector. Quilts from her collection are peridically displayed at the Museum of American Folk Art in NYC. Feisty, fearless and fun loving, she'll be deeply missed by the cast of thousands who admired and loved her. She withheld nothing but her age. A memorial service will be Sunday, November 4th at 2PM at ''The Riverside'', 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue.
