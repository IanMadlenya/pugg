        ADAMS--Eddie. Parade magazine mourns the loss of a colleague and dear friend. Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer Eddie Adams was the talent behind some of the most moving and poignant images ever to appear on the cover of Parade for more than 20 years. Eddie's genius was his ability to capture tension in every photo, whether it be the still of a murder or the animation in the eyes of a movie star. He was eclectic and incomparable, unyielding in the pursuit of excellence. Whatever the assignment -Pope John Paul II, Fidel Castro or Ronald Reagan; Arnold Schwarzenegger, Clint Eastwood or Cher; Mickey Mouse or Big Bird --Adams approached it with integrity and professionalism. His work is legendary. He was a compassionate and caring human being. He was a mentor to young photographers and a dedicated friend, husband and father. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Alyssa, his family and to everyone who cared about him. He will be missed. Walter Anderson Chairman Parade Publications
