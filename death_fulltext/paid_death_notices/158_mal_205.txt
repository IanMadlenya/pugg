        CHALLENOR-Dr. Bernard. The Division of Health Policy and Management of Columbia Mailman School of Public Health mourn the sudden loss of Dr. Bernard Challenor, a distinguished member of our faculty. Dr. Challenor was a wonderful teacher, beloved by generations of students. He was an extraordinarily engaging classroom lecturer, a warm and invaluable advisor, and an outstanding role model. He was always an unstinting contributor to the Division's activities and was a trusted friend and valued colleague to all of us in the Division. Before joining the School, he held several other important positions, including service as a Medical Officer in the Smallpox Eradication and Measles Control Program in West Africa and as a physician with the Peace Corps. We extend our sympathy to his sister, Dr. Yasoma Challenor. He will be greatly missed.
