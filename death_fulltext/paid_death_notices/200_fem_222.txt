        MILLER--Ruth O'Brien. Ruth passed away on September 25, 2003 after a recurring illness. Born on October 11, 1930 she was the daughter of Abbie Aldridge and Charlie O'Brien and the wife of the late Melvin Miller. Ruth had been a nurse and a teacher. She was a muse to her late husband, and possessed a love of life and friends that will be remembered by all with whom she came into contact. We will miss her. As she wished, there will no service. A donation in her memory may be made to The Jacob Perlow Hospice, Beth Israel Medical Center, 1st Ave at 16th St., NY, NY 10003.
