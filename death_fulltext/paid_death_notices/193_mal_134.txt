        LIEF-Ruth Ann. Lehman College and The City University of New York mourn the death of Ruth Ann Lief, Lehman's First Lady for 23 years. Leonard Lief was President of Lehman from its founding in 1968 until his retirement in 1990. Mrs. Lief was a gifted cellist and writer whose books include ''George Orwell,'' ''Geriatric Junkie'' and a forthcoming collection of poetry. We extend deepest sympathies to the family. Contributions may be made to the Ruth Ann and Leonard Lief Scholarships, Lehman College Foundation. Matthew Goldstein Chancellor, CUNY Ricardo R. Fernandez President, Lehman College
