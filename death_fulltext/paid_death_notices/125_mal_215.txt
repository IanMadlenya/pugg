        RAGER-Mayor Yitzhack I. The officers of the Zionist Organization of America mourn the passing of our dear friend ''Ijo'' who, for many years, was Chairman of the Board of ZOA's Kfar Silver schools in Ashkelon, Israel. He was a dedicated Zionist and his contributions to the Negev and the development and growth of Beer-Sheva will serve as an inspiration for future generations. He will be sorely missed. We extend our deepest sympathy to his beloved wife, Dr. Bracha Rager-Zisman, and the family. May they find comfort among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Morton A. Klein, National Pres. Michael Orbach, Ch. Bd. of Dirs Herschel Auerbach and Sidney Silverman Co-Chairs ZOA Projects in Israel
