        LIEBERMAN-Minnie. Boys Town Jerusalem mourns the passing of a valued friend and Chai Founder who continued the legacy of her parents, the legendary ba'aley tzedokah and chesed, Andrew and Rose Miller. Mrs. Lieberman, together with her late husband, Hyman, and brothers Leon Miller and the late Ira Miller, both Boys Town Board Members and loyal supporters, ensured that the lofty Torah ideals of her father's namesake, the sainted Reb Nochumke of Grodno, would be perpetuated. May the family be comforted together with the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Josh S. Weston, Chairman Michael J. Scharf, President Rabbi Moshe Linchner, Dean Rabbi Ronald L. Gray, Exec. V.P.
