        BLAKE-Christopher. Painter and sculptor passed away in the darkened hours of September 27 at the age of 51. The art-world has lost a sensitive and creative talent. His original and provocative work took on a whimsical surreal magic that reflected his entire life. Chris graduated from Cooper Union Art School, NY in 1971. He is survived by his mother Grace, and two brothers, Charles and Robert. He lived his life his way. We will miss him dearly. Services today at Bartholomew Funeral Home, 2:005:00, 7:00-9:30 PM, Bellmore, LI.
