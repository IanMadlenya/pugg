The Board of Trustees, the Purnell Advisory Council and the entire Purnell School community in Pottersville, NJ, express profound sorrow at the death of Patricia King Cantlay, Trustee, and extend our deepest sympathy to her husband David, their children Eliza and Jack, and all of her family.

Her courage, leadership, integrity and good common sense were an inspiration. She will be greatly missed by the entire Purnell family.
