        HYACINTH-Michael D. Beloved son of Brigida and Fernando, and brother of Stephanie, Mark and Mario. Died on April 24 after a brief illness. His family, friends and colleagues adored him. Michael started his fashion career as an illustrator for several designers. His best most exciting and creative time was his work as design assistant to Jackie Rogers. Artist, visionary, irrepressible, innovative and enchanting, Michael taught us all to see the world anew.
