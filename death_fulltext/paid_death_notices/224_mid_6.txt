She was the beloved mother of our alumnus, Rabbi Nathan Kahan, and cherished sister of Zev Binyamin Glueck and Jacob Glueck, a YU Benefactor along with his daughter, Vivian Glueck (and Henry) Rosenberg. May the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel,President Dr. Norman Lamm Chancellor Morry J Weiss, Chairman YU Board of Trustees
