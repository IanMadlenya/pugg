        SPIELMAN-William. Bill's life recalls the Rabbinic story of a king who had a beautiful diamond. But it had a scratch, which no one could eradicate, until a craftsman converted the scratch into the stem of a rose. Bill's life also was like a rose, becoming more beautiful as he enriched all our lives. Nancy and Irving Silverman
