        ARYE-Leonora. Passed away peacefully October 8, 2001. Beloved and loving wife of Leonard for more than 47 years. We never stopped laughing. Loving and adored mother of Larry, Lowell and Lane. Loving mother-in-law of Linda & grandmother of Mollie. A gifted sculptor and writer, who was too modest for the gifts she had. Her last days were much like her life, brave and uncomplaining. We will love and remember her to the end of our days. Funeral on October 10, 11 AM, Zion Memorial Chapel, 767 East Boston Post Road, Mamaroneck, New York.
