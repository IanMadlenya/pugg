        PADAWER--Eva. The Be'er Hagolah Institutes extend their deepest condolences to Micheline Ratzersdorfer, wife of our founder and longtime President Marc Ratzersdorfer, on the passing of her beloved mother, Mrs. Eva Padawer, who led her family in support of the education of Russian Jewish children for over 25 years. May you be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
