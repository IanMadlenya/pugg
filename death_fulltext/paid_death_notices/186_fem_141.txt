        RAPPAPORT-Bernice (Bunny). It is with deep sadness that we announce the untimely passing of Bunny. She was loved and adored by husband Arnold, daughter Lynn, son Jay, daughter-in-law Harriet, granddaughters Julie and Katie and countless friends and family. We are all deeply affected by this huge loss which took us all by surprise, and she fought her sudden illness bravely and with dignity. The center of so many loving family and friends, she had great style, and will be remembered for her warmth, loyalty, caring and concern for all those who knew her. Services at Plaza Memorial Chapel, 630 Amsterdam Ave, 1PM today.
