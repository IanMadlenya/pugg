        RAISLER-Robert K. Penn Engineering notes with sadness the passing of our alumnus and friend. Robert Raisler was President of the Class of 1926 and the 1993 recipient of The Yarnall Award for Excellence in Engineering. Always a gentleman he was admired by students, faculty and alumni of the school. We will miss him. Eduardo D. Glandt, Interim Dean
