        GOODMAN-Suzanne C. The American Friends of The Hebrew University expresses profound regret on the loss of Suzanne C. Goodman. A Chicago Chapter Board Member, former member of the Council of Trustees and longtime supporter of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, her dedication to the University and the Jewish community will be sorely missed.
