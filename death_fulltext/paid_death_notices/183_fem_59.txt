        WILLIAMS-Dora duPont. Of Evanston, IL, died March 19, 2002, at the age of 90. Wife of the late Lynn A. Williams Jr.; mother of Eve (Edward) Noonan of Chicago, Ann (Bernard) Jennett of Evanston, Lynn A. Williams III of Chicago, Dora (Scott) Keller of New York City, and Susan (James) Lenfestey of Minneapolis. A social activist with a wry humor, she once wrote of her life: ''Age 18: Suspended from Vassar for breaking the college rules (they don't have them any more). Age 50: Jailed in Georgia for breaking the Jim Crow rules (they don't have them anymore either). . . . Along the way I married Lynn Williams and accumulated five children, 21 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren. It's been great fun -still is.'' She had an enormous love for life and would have liked to have gone on longer. Memorial service at 4 PM, Saturday, April 20, in Evanston, IL, Scott-North Shore Chapels; 847-832-9600.
