        BOGDONOFF-Shirley (nee Laszlo), Liebowitz on Feb. 12, 2002 after months of illness. Family, friends and community were her involvement in life. Her love, humor and how she affected each of us will live in our memories. In January, Congregation Anshei Shalom designated her as its first Aishes Chayil (a woman of valor) award recipient. She was grateful to be able to see everyone at that ceremony and surprised and humbled to be so honored. He who weds a good woman, it is as if he had fulfilled all the precepts of the Torah. Survived by her husband, Harold, who has lost his best friend in the whole world; daughters Lisa & Lori and dearest sons-in-law Sheldon and Paul and six grandchildren; brother Maurice and wife Phyllis, sister Rosalyn, brother-in-law Harry, sister-in-law Alice, nephews, nieces & cousins; a lifetime of dear friends and neighbors. Shiva: 523 Walton, CT., W. Hempstead. Please offer a charitable donation in her memory.
