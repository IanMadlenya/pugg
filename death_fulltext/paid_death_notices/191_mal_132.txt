        PERGAMENT-Murray. My deepest sympathies to Irene and the entire Pergament family. I deeply regretted not getting the opportunity to say a final thank you and goodbye. I was fortunate enough to have shared a very special relationship with Murray through a door rarely opened to anyone outside the family. He shaped my life more than anyone outside of my own family. For all we shared together I say thank you once again but I cannot say goodbye to someone who will always be present in my mind and heart. In loving memory, Michael Lurie and family.
