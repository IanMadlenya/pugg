        VAN ALEN-Candace A. One of the tireless supporters of the Soldiers', Sailors', Marines' and Airmen's Club, Candy Van Alen left us peacefully on the morning ofTuesday, 19 February, 2002. Without her indefatigable efforts and generosity, SSMAC would have been hard put to survive the many years of public disinterest in things Military that followed World War II. She and her late husband, Jimmy, who was President of the Club during three successive terms, were ever prime movers in a cause that addresed the dire need of Servicemen and Servicewomen for a safe and affordable home away from home as they transited our great city on their way to new tours of duty elsewhere. She set a high standard for our wholly volunteer Board of Directors and Advisors, one that, thanks to her, will endure despite the uncertanties confronting us in the Twenty-First Century. Candy Van Alen was one of a kind, and we at SSMAC are eternally grateful for her many, many kindnesses throughout the years. R.I.P. Ivan Obolensky, Chairman Joseph Koletar, President
