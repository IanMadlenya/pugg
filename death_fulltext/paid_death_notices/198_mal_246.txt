        SLAVIN--Leon. 88, passed away July 21, 2003. Beloved brother of Morris and the late Bessie, he will be sorely missed by their children and grandchildren -- Jeannie, Steve, Paul, Arlene, Jen, Leslie, Michael--and his many friends for his sweet gentle nature, his innumerable acts of kindness and generosity, and his lifelong zest for ideas. >>AD#
