        LEWIS-Sydney. Dear Frances, the death of Sydney caused me deep pain. In this difficult life I thought of him as a second father. I will always remember him as I do remember Cesare Cassina was for me and for a long time more than a friend. Also as Venetian I would like to express here a Venetian's grief for the death of Sydney Lewis, its noble admirer. Gaetano Pesce
        LEWIS-Sydney. Harvey Lichtenstein, Karen Brooks Hopkins and the Board of Trustees of the Brooklyn Academy of Music mourn the passing of our dear friend Sydney Lewis. Sydney was a member of the BAM Board in the late 1980s, and he and his wife Frances have been friends and supporters for many years. Sydney was dedicated to both contemporary visual and performing artists. He embodied the spirit of ''the Next Wave''. We will miss him.
