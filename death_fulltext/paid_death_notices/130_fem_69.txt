        HARSHAW-Margaret. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of beloved artist and teacher, Margaret Harshaw. Singing first as a mezzo-soprano and later as a soprano, she sang more Wagnerian roles than any other singer at the Metropolitan-24 in all, including 14 in the ''Ring'' alone-during a career that lasted nearly a quarter century. Equally distinguished as a teacher, this great American artist leaves us an immeasurable legacy through her many students. We extend our deepest sympathy to her family. Joseph Volpe, General Manager James Levine, Artistic Director
