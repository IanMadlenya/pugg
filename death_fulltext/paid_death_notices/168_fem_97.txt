        HARVEY-Sister Edmund, RSHM. The trustees, faculty, staff, students and alumnae of Marymount Manhattan College mourn the loss of our beloved and committed trustee Sr. Edmund Harvey. Sister Edmund was not only an active trustee of the College since 1987 and current chairperson of the Student Affairs committee of the Board but also was one of the founders of the college and a driving force in its growth since 1947. Sr. Edmund was faculty member in the department of Psychology at MMC from 1948-1960, Director of Admissions from 1960-61 and Academic Dean from 1961-66. She also taught at Marymount College in Tarrytown and during her life was on the Boards of the Marymount School in NYC, Marymount Tarrytown and Marymount Arlington. Currently she served the Order of the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary as Director of Ongoing Formation. Sister Edmund was a role model for her students, and articulate scholar, a wise spiritual advisor, and a strong and holy woman who cared deeply for her family, her sisters and her extended family at the College. Her spirit lives in the many lives she touched. William E. Murray Chairman, Board of Trustees Regina S.
