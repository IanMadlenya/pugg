        HOUDE--Raymond W., MD. The Department of Pharmacology, Weill Medical College of Cornell University mourns the loss of our esteemed colleague who passed away on March 8, 2006. Ray was a graduate of the NYU Medical School. In 1948 he began his life-long association with the Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center. He was Head of the Analgesic Studies Section and then Chief of the Pain Service. Ray literally developed the field of the clinical pharmacology of opioid analgesics. He developed the tools to measure subjective responses like pain and pain relief that are now routinely used in adult and pediatric pain patients. His table of relative analgesic potencies of the clinically used opioids formed the basis for dose conversion tables that are used throughout the world and are found in virtually every Pharmacology text. Ray was a member of the Department of Pharmacology since the 1950's and taught in the medical pharmacology course for many years. He was a founding member of the International Association for the Study of Pain, the American Pain Society and the Eastern Pain Association and the recipient of many awards for his contributions to our understanding analgesic drugs and their appropriate use in the management of pain.
