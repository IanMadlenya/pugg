        SUSSMAN--Albert. The 48,000 worldwide members of the International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC), its Board of Trustees and officers salute the life and accomplishments of Albert Sussman, the association's first executive vice president. Al Sussman joined ICSC in 1958 and his career spanned 28 years. When he joined the association as its first employee there were only 75 members and the shopping center industry was in its infancy. Today the 46,000 shopping centers in the United States alone account for $1.98 trillion in retail sales. The importance to the economy of the modern shopping center, the growth of professionalism in the retail real estate sector, and the respect ICSC has earned globally are very much a product of Al Sussman's efforts. We mourn his passing and are grateful for his life.
        SUSSMAN--Albert. We have lost a beloved cousin and dear friend. He filled our lives with love, humor and warmth; with a devotion to study and learning; and with his enormous pride in his family and his heritage. He leaves to us and to the world a wonderful legacy of caring and generous children and grandchildren. He always gave to us ''that best portion of a good man's life--his little, nameless, unremembered acts of kindness and of love.'' We will miss him always.
