        CHAYKIN--Irving. The Baruch College community is deeply saddened at the passing of Irving Chaykin, 1932, Professor Emeritus in the Stan Ross Department of Accountancy, on March 18. Irving Chaykin arrived at Baruch in 1929 and never left us. He was a beloved faculty member for more than 35 years and a loyal alumnus his entire adult life. The famed Chaykin CPA Review course trained generations of accountants. In 1995, the College preserved his legacy by dedicating the Irving J. Chaykin Conference Room in his honor. Baruch alumni everywhere remember him with deep affection and respect. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to Clarice, his wife of more than 60 years, to his children, Daniel, Maury and Debra, to his many grandchildren, and to his former colleagues and students.
