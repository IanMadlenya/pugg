        EDELSTEIN-Louis. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) express profound sorrow at the loss of Louis Edelstein of Atlantic City, NJ. He was a legendary supporter of the American Technion Society, the Technion and Israel who modestly avoided any public recognition for his exemplary devotion. As a Technion Guardian, Mr. Edelstein demonstrated the highest level of commitment for the Technion. Passionate about the value of scientific and technological education and its centrality to Israel's future, he supported many projects at the Technion including the Louis Edelstein Center for the Investigation of Materials with Quasi-Periodic Structures, the Louis Edelstein Chair in Cancer Research and the Louis Edelstein Research Fund in the Faculty of Medicine. In recognition of his devoted support, he was awarded an Honorary Fellowship from the Technion. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Sonia Edelstein and the entire Edelstein family.

Gross, Greater Delaware Valley Chapter President Stephen B. Klein, Greater Delaware Valley Chapter Chair Ivan Schonfeld, Eastern Seaboard Region Director
