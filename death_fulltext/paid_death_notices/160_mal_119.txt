        FATES-J. Gilbert, on May 1, 2000. Beloved husband of Faye Appleberry. Proud, adoring father of Amy, Gib, Decia. Smitten fatherin-law of Yolanda. Friend of Bushrod and Mazie. Born Sept. 29, 1913, in Newark, NJ to Dora Racicot and Joseph Faatz, Gil graduated from the University of Virginia in 1937. After a brief stint in legitimate theater, his career as a pioneer in T.V. was launched with CBS in 1941 and, after service in the Coast Guard during WWII, continued for some 50 years, most with Goodson-Todman Productions, where he produced such classic game and panel shows as ''To Tell the Truth,'' ''I've Got a Secret,'' and ''What's My Line?'' An avid fisherman, seasoned world traveler, relentless photographer, jazz aficionado, skilled tinkerer, sublime dancer, passable but enthusiastic golfer, peerless raconteur, Gil's warmth, intelligence, humor and generosity will be missed and long remembered by legions of friends and acquaintances. His life, spirit and knowledge have enriched us in innumerable ways. His tragic loss will be keenly and permanently felt. Faye, Amy, Gib & Yolanda, Decia, Berta
