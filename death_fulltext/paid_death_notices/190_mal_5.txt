        PATTEN-Jim. The Blue Hill Troupe is deeply saddened by the death of one of our devoted members. Jim joined the Troupe immediately upon his arrival in New York in 1990 and quickly became a stalwart member of our props and set production teams. Recently, Jim's booming laugh and benevolent energy were an ongoing presence in our ticket office. We thank him for his great dedication and extend sympathies to his family and other close friends.
