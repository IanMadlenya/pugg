Mr. Blatas created the ''ADL Holocaust Memorial Wall,'' commemorating the night of December 5, 1943, when the first 200 of Venice's Jews were rounded up and deported to their deaths. The plaques, a recasting of the original series in Venice's old foundry district, are on permanent display outside ADL's national headquarters. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Regina Resnik, and their family. Howard P. Berkowitz, National Chairman Abraham H. Foxman, National Director
