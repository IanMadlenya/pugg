        HALPERN--Nathan I. The Trustees and staff of the International Center of Photography note with sadness the passing of Nathan I. Halpern, President of the Board of Trustees from 1977 to 1982. Nathan provided strong leadership in establishing measures to guarantee the growth and stability of the young institution. He was also an avid photographer who each year shared with us his pictures of the roses he and Edith grew. We extend our sympathies to his son, Michael, daughter-in-law, Chris Grant, and two grandsons. Cornell Capa, Founding Director Emeritus Rita Hillman, Honorary Chair Willis Hartshorn, Ehrenkranz Director
