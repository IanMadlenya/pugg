        PHILLIPS-Herman Alfred, 95, Physician of Miami Beach and formerly of Brooklyn, New York, died in his sleep on October 20, 1997. A graduate of CCNY and NYU-Bellevue (1928) he served his patients with skill, compassion, enormous energy and good humor for more than 50 years in NYC and Miami Beach. An avid swimmer, he realized the benefits of daily exercise and a low-fat diet in the 1930's, long before this concept was popularized, and recommended it to his patients-film stars and statesmen included. He is survived by his devoted wife Hana Giniger ''Ginny'' Phillips of Coconut Creek, Florida, a daughter, Judith Phillips Lichtenstein of NYC, two sons, Charles of Stuart, Florida and Edward of Boca Raton, Florida and five grandchildren.
