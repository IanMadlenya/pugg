        GIORDANI--John E. (age 63), born June 10, 1942, in the Bronx, New York, passed away April 16, 2005 in Newport Beach, CA. A resident of Orange County since 1986, John was the son of Benvenuto Giordani, who immigrated to America from Italy in 1929, and Louise Landi. John grew up in the Bronx and later served as a Lieutenant in the Army. A self-made man, John worked as a taxi driver in order to attend the City College of New York. He became a Certified Public Accountant with Peat Marwick, and he was later recruited to Revlon where he served as controller and interim-CFO. In 1986 John moved his family to Newport Beach when he accepted a position as CFO and EVP at ICN Pharmaceuticals, a Costa Mesa based NYSE company. John was a private man who always stressed the importance and sanctity of family. His compassion and unending generosity touched many. He is survived by his loving wife, Margaret, and his three sons, John, Justin, and Joseph. He will be greatly missed by his brother, Peter, and his sister, Rita, both of New York. A mass will be held this Friday, April 22 at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church in Newport Beach. A reception celebrating John's life will follow.
