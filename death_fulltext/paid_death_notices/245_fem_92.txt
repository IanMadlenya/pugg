        LAYZELL--Natalie Ann, on June 7, 2007. Beloved mother of Marianne Miller of New York, and thoughtful friend to many, Natalie retired from The New York Times at the end of 2006 after a 40-year career there and at The International Herald Tribune, where she served for many years as the New York editor. Her friends and colleagues will miss her energy and spark and her clever limericks. Natalie was born in Harrow, Middlesex, England on January 26, 1941, and is also survived by sister Gwennie and brothers Harry and Ralph, all of Vancouver, British Columbia, brother Tony Layzell of New Zealand; and many nephews and nieces. An informal gathering to celebrate her life will be held this Saturday, June 16, 2007, from 6-9 p.m. at the New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, New York, NY. The family asks that in lieu of flowers, donations be sent to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and Alcoholics Anonymous.
