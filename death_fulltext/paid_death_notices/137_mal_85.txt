        ASTOR-Saul D. The former Officers of Management Safeguards, Inc., sadly mourn the untimely passing of its President and Founder. His leadership, guidance and origination of the Loss Prevention concept has contributed to a much safer society and helped the business community dramatically control inventory shortage. He built one of the finest security protection companies in the country and developed a group of executives who are now leaders in the industry. He will truly be missed.
