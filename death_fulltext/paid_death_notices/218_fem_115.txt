        MITCHELL--Sally, 91, peacefully at home December 28, 2004. Loving wife, mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, sister, aunt and great-aunt. Sally was a kind, gentle woman whose first priority was love of family. She was a loyal and lifelong friend. She leaves behind her wonderful nurse's aide, Christiana. Graveside services were held at Mt. Ararat, Farmingdale, NY. Rest in peace.
