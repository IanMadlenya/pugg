        BRONSTEIN--Murray, died June 12, 2005. Beloved and loving father of David. Cherished and devoted brother of twin sister Anne. Proud Founder of Murray Bronstein Associates, Personnel Agency. He was a vital life force. His passions included chess, Shakespeare, history, theatre and travel. He demonstrated great compassion and generosity in his many contributions to charity. He fought a ferocious and gallant battle for five years against a cruel, devastating disease. May he find the peace that so eluded him in his last years.
