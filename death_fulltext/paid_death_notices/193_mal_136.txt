        OLSON-Paul. The Musicians, Trustees, and Staff of The Marlboro Music School and Festival mourn the loss of a valued Board Member and Officer, and a good friend, and send our heartfelt sympathy to his wife, Dorothy. Paul played a key role in the incorporation of Marlboro in 1951, and generously gave his legal counsel and served as Board ''Clerk'' for almost fifty years. The devotion of Paul and Dorothy to Marlboro and its musicians, and to each other, will be cherished by us all for years to come. Stephen Stamas, Chairman Board of Trustees Marlboro Music School and Festival
