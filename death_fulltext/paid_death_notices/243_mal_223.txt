        NEMSER--Stanley. The partners, associates and staff of Wolf Popper LLP mourn the passing of our esteemed mentor, colleague and friend, Stanley Nemser, who was a partner in the firm for more than 20 years until recently becoming of counsel. Mr. Nemser, a brilliant litigator, was a pioneer in the field of class action securities litigation. He graduated from New York University and Harvard Law School. Stanley Nemser was proud of his service to his country during World War II, when he served in the Philippines under General MacArthur. We will miss his counsel dearly and will remember him always with great fondness. The Partners, Associates and Staff of Wolf Popper, LLP
