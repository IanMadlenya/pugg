        FLEEMAN-David B. The American Jewish Committee is deeply saddened by the death of our beloved friend and longtime leader, David Fleeman. David was an Honorary National Vice President, a member of our National Board of Governors, National Leadership Council, Horizon Society, and a past president of AJC's Miami Chapter. A wise and beneficent individual, he cared deeply about democracy, social justice and the Jewish people. He will be sorely missed. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his two sons and the rest of the grieving family. Harold Tanner, President David A. Harris, Exec. Dir.
