        TOKIEDA--George Z. The Brearley School community deeply mourns the passing on March 5, 2005 of George Z. Tokieda, a treasured member of our science faculty, who served as department head from 1977-1983 and was department co-head from 1983-1986; he was also the holder of a Chair for Excellence in Teaching from 1994-1997. Born in Clewiston, FL, he graduated from Princeton University in 1963 and began teaching science at Philadelphia's William Penn Charter School and the Buckley School in Manhattan. In 1975, Mr. Tokieda joined the Brearley Science Department, where for almost 30 years he rejoiced in the opportunity to inspire students with a love of science, teaching them to ask the right questions and lighting up the classroom with his knowledge, warmth, optimism and flair. A founder of the Brearley Employees of Color discussion group, he volunteered at the Children's Storefront School and consulted for the Children's Museum in Phoenix. He was a model of courage in fighting serious health problems over the last 20 years. We send our sincere condolences to his wife, Margaret Quigley Tokieda; his children, Kathryn J. Tokieda '98, and Charles P. Tokieda; his mother, Anna Imperial; and his brother and sister. A memorial gathering will take place at Brearley on April 8th; the family suggests that contributions in his memory be made to the Heifer Project, St. Jude's Children's Society or the Brearley School.
