        CALDANO -- Daniel. 64, passed away suddenly in his sleep on February 22, 2004. He is survived by his beloved sister Joan Caldano, f.s.p., cousins and many dear and treasured friends. Born and raised in NYC, Dan reveled in every aspect of the city's vibrancy. For 32 years he worked in the Butler Library at Columbia University and retired as the User Support Specialist in the library's systems office. His days of retirement were taken up by an almost daily commute between his home in Greenwich Village and either Lincoln Center or the Great White Way. He will be remembered for his vast knowledge and love of the arts, his keen intellect and quick wit, but most of all for his kind and generous heart which embraced all those around him. And he did it all with gusto one day at a time. A memorial service to be annoucned.
