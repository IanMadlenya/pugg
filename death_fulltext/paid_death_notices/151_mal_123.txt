        GERSTEN-Marvin. He was a father, a husband, a hilarious, incredibly generous, ultra-charismatic, whip-smart and very good looking man. Marvin Gersten died comfortably in his home, at the age of 60, of malignant melanoma, August 10, 1999, surrounded by his family. A self-made man, Marvin grew up in Bensonhurst. He worked his way through City College of New York (graduated 1961) & Brooklyn Law (graduated 1963), waiting tables summers in the Catskills. Marvin went on to become the senior partner in his own reputable law firm, Gersten, Savage & Kaplowitz, which he founded 26 years ago, and to establish his residence on Park Avenue. Most recently, he led the firm's litigation and regulation divisions. Marvin's career fasttracked early with his appointment as New York's Commissioner of Purchase in the John Lindsay administration at the age of 28, the youngest person ever to hold that position. He then joined the revered firm of Borden & Ball for a number of years to practice law before starting his own firm. As an avid, consummate and influential New Yorker, a dedicated Knicks fan and a lover of the good life, Marvin was as likely to be seen debating sports with a stranger in the street as dining at Montrachet, his favorite restaurant. Marvin is succeeded and will be sorely missed by his wife, Diana, son, Gregory and daughter, Nikki, as well as a host of other loved ones and dear friends. Service Thursday, August 12, 11:30AM at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street, NYC.
