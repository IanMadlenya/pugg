        KNIPE-Timothy W. On behalf of the Board of Directors and staff of Lighthouse International, we are deeply saddened by the loss of Timothy W. Knipe, a longtime friend and supporter of our organization. Mr. Knipe began his extensive and meaningful relationship with the Lighthouse in 1986 as a volunteer reader to people with impaired vision. He joined the Board in 1990, served as its Chairman from 1993-1999 and remained a director until his passing. Under Mr. Knipe's visionary stewardship as Chairman, the Lighthouse expanded its leadership role both nationally and internationally, helping more people worldwide overcome the challenges of vision impairment. In recognition of Mr. Knipe's unwavering support of, and dedication to, the Lighthouse, the Timothy & Mary Grace Knipe Volunteer Center-a floor of the Lighthouse headquarters building in Manhattan-was recently named. We express our deepest condolences to his wife and family. While he will be missed tremendously, we can cherish the indelible mark he left on our institution. William B. Follett, Chairman of the Board Barbara Silverstone, DSW President and CEO Lighthouse International
