        FALENCKI -- John Julius. Friends and colleagues of John Julius Falencki mourn the untimely death of our beloved ''Janic'' in the water off West Palm Beach, FL. We express our sympathy to his mother Karen, his wife Maureen and his children Emily, Jonah and Andy. John was a pioneer--one of the first residency trained family doctors in Manhattan. Many followed in his footsteps as he continued through teaching students and residents to expand the field and its influence. John was a renaissance man; a philosopher, healer, physician, businessman, farmer, family therapist and homeopath. He was relentlessly curious and the breadth of his interests amazed those around him. He lived in awe of the homeostasis between man and nature. He loved his family, the ocean, mushroom collecting, and through the Cascade Farm, was sharing this awe with schoolchildren, people with disabilities and others. John, we grieve the loss of your love, wise counsel, friendship and teachings. You live on in our hearts and memories. Steven Tamarin, M.D. Neil Calman, M.D. And the entire Institute for Urban Family Health
