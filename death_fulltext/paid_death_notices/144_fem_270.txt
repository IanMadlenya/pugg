        BELTZER-Beverly (nee Blumenthal). Was a jewel, a diamond, a selfless, loving, caring and compassionate human being - a ''mensch'', who gave her heart and soul to her family, her friends, her colleagues. To her ''one and only'' child, Margery, whose life was intertwined with hers so adoringly, to her grandchildren, Joshua, Sara, and Yossi, who lit up her life, to her Judaism, her Synagogue, her charities, her teaching profession-her passing leaves a void, an emptiness. She was a true ''Aishet Chayil'', a woman of valor. ''May her deeds praise her in the gates.'' May God grant her peace, reunited now with her beloved Carl. Shiva will be observed at the Wise residence, through Sunday morning. May her memory always be a blessing. From her loving family
