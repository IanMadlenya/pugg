        WISE--Sidney, journalist, died peacefully at home on August 24, one day before his 90th birthday. Sent to Madrid in 1943, first as an Assistant Press Attache of the American Embassy and later correspondent for the Overseas News Organization and CBS, he was the first journalist to expose the fascist Franco regime. His frank and honest reporting led to the Spanish government forcing him to surrender his credentials under the threat of explusion from the country. After returning from Spain, he worked as a public relations officer in Nelson Rockefeller's Office of Inter-American Affairs then went on to be a public information officer at the United Nations. He moved to Mexico in 1961 and subsequently won the Francisco Zarco award for the best international reporting on Mexico in 1968. An authority on the economy and investments in Mexico, Mr. Wise has written articles on theses subjects as correspondent to the New York Times and London Times as well as the Wall Street Journal. Over the span of his journalistic career, he knew and interviewed many of Latin America's most notable dignitaries, including Fidel Castro. He was owner and publisher of The Mexican Investor newsletter which in 1976, along with its money management business, was merged to Accival, a private stock brokerage. He later founded the investment firm Mexican Financial Advisory Service. In 1973 Doubleday published a worldwide edition of his book ''Invest and Retire in Mexico.'' He was a consultant to a number of organizations including Union Carbide Mexicana, Syntex, Alexander Proudfoot PLC and IBM de Mexico. He was predeceased by his second wife, author and playwright Margarita Urueta, after 40 years of marriage, and his son Jeffrey Wise. He is survived by his three daughters, Wendy, Carol, and Anne, his sister Edna and six grandchildren.
