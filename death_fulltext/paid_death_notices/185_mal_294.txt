        POST-Sheldon. 9/5/36 to 6/25/88. Founder Chelsea Pines Inn, Chairman NYC Gay Men's Chorus, Board, Congregation Beth Simchat Torah. Fourteen years gone: a moment, a lifetime. As we celebrate Gay Pride Week, we pause to recall those who have gone before us in the still-present war against AIDS. Sheldon was a proud gay man who never stopped fighting to create a better world, who never lost his dream or his passion. A remarkable lover, son, brother, uncle, friend. Tom Klebba and I ask you to take a moment & remember a generation that is lost but not forgotten: Mark Fuschetti, Peter Monette, Gary Olde, Tom Dickey, Jon Flaherty, Gary Brubach, Benn Brown and Wayne Kell, Tom Bradley, Garon Douglas, Jay ''Peggy Sue'' Farrar, Dean X Johnson, Allan Kendric and Ron McSwiggen, Bob Levine, Eddie Peters, Martin Teitel, Quinton Johnson, Norman Sweet, Eddie Tilchen, so many others. ''Sometimes people leave you halfway through the wood. Do not let it grieve you, no one leaves for good.'' Sheldon, my love, know that you will always be missed and cherished. All will be remembered & celebrated as long as we live. Jay Lesige
