        EPSTEIN-Ethel. The West End Synagogue community mourns the loss of this lovely woman in her 92nd year, the middle child of a family of five daughters, all known for their beauty. Ethel was the beloved wife of the late Stanley Epstein, a labor lawyer to the fur industry, and the cherished mother of their cherished daughter, Anne Newton. Spunky and curious all her life, she was alert to the end to nuances in the Mid East and sensitive to the needs and feelings of others. We will miss her. Services will be held on Wednesday, 12:30PM, at Plaza Memorial Chapel, 91 Street and Amsterdam Avenue. Rabbi Avi Winokur, Rabbi Yael Ridberg, President Marcia Weller
