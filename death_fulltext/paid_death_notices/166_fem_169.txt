        STOLZ-Monica (Mona). The extended Stolz and Gutwirth family mourns the loss of Mona, and sends our deepest sympathy and condolences to our wonderful cousins, Danny, Alan and Phyllis, and their families. Our Aunt and Sisterin-Law will forever be remembered by us all for the countless acts of love, kindness and respect which she so generously bestowed on her family and friends. As a young adult, she faced with enormous dignity and courage the uncertainties of W.W. II and like so many others she came to America to start a new life. She and her husband, Dr. Bernard Stolz, had three young sons when he suddenly passed away in his prime leaving her to be the sole parent. She faced this enormous challenge as she faced so many others, with extraordinary grace, fortitude and an indomitable spirit. True to her wishes, she remained totally independent until the end. She deeply cherished family and friends, always remembered birthdays, and made celebrations special with her beautiful knitted clothing and delicious holiday cakes. We will always love and remember her for her warmth and kindness, for her loving and caring spirit. The Stolz & Gutwirth Family
