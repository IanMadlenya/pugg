        SAMETH--Jack. A pioneer in television broadcasting, producer/director Jack Sameth introduced TV audiences to the things he loved most-music, great talent and the wonders of science and the human body. Mr. Sameth died Tuesday from a heart attack. He was 79. He began his career at a time when television was almost always live, and in black and white. He covered the first Americanmanned space flight, directed and produced specials on his idols Benny Goodman and Peggy Lee, and was the executive producer of televised concerts at the White House. But music wasn't his only passion. He produced the awardwinning series, ''The Brain'', followed by its sequel, ''The Mind'', both aired on PBS. He also directed and produced many programs with Bill Moyers and, in between, became a network executive at ABC where he supervised live prime-time programming. Sameth retired in 1996 and spent most of his time in Northport, LI. Mr. Sameth is survived by his beloved sisters, Lois Geldermann and Dorothy Buswell. A service will be held at Nolan & Taylor Howell Funeral Home in Northport on saturday at 11:30 am. A further celebration of his life will be held in NYC in the Fall.
