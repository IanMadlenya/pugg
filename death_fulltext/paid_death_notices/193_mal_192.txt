        BLUMENTHAL-Samuel. A gentle person, a builder of consensus and community, a lover of culture and the Jewish people, he helped build and served as chair of each of the major institutions of the Jewish Reconstructionist movement, where his good work continues to touch the lives of thousands. We extend our condolences to his family. May his memory be a blessing. Aaron Ziegelman General Chair Donald Shapiro Chair, Board of Governors Rabbi Dan Ehrenkrantz President
