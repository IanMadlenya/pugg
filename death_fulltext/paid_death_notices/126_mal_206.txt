        SARGENT-Daniel I. All of us at Salomon Brothers have lost a great friend. Dan Sargent founded our investment banking practice, guided the Firm through the shoals of credit risk, and provided inspiration and guidance to a generation of young people. Dan set the highest standards of integrity, loyalty and modesty. He never sought attention for himself, rather he worked tirelessly for the good of the Firm. As individuals and as a Firm, we all feel a great sense of loss, and our grief is heightened by the knowledge of how fortunate we are to have had Dan with us. We offer our deepest sympathy to his family. Salomon Brothers
        SARGENT-Daniel I. His judgment on a broad cross section of issues affecting Salomon Brothers was always reasoned and reflective. His external representation of the firm carried a standard of excellence and professionalism. It was a privilege for each of us to have been his friend and partner during his nearly three decades of association with the firm. Our deepest sympathies to his wife Elaine and his family. John H. Gutfreund Thomas W. Strauss
        SARGENT-Daniel I. It was a privilege, honor, joy and pleasure to work for you, Dan. The loss of a true gentleman who leaves an indelible imprint on our hearts. Nancy Matarazzo, Secretary
