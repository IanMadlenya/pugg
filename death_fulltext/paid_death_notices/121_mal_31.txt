        INNISS-Charles E. The Board and staff of The South Forty Corporation mourn the passing of their longtime former Board member, Charles Inniss, who served the agency with dedication and deep personal interest in its mission of providing meaningful rehabilitation programs and job opportunities for men and women ex-offenders released from the New York State and City correctional systems. We extend our sympathy to his wife and family. Charlie will be missed but not forgotten. Anthony Schulte, President John Rakis, Executive Director
