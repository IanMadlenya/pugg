        BENNAHUM-Michael. On November 1, Michael Bennahum, 58, died of cancer at home surrounded by his family. He is survived by his soulmate and wife Leslie, his children David and Samantha who gave him so much joy, his aunt Stella whom he loved dearly, and his brother David whose care and love were constant. Though taken so soon, we were blessed with every moment Michael shared with us. His generosity extended to his work as an investment banker, film producer, and Democratic social activist. His greatest gift was the gift of inspiration, especially to the young where he gave them the confidence and clarity to extend themselves in pursuits that seemed beyond their reach. His legacy will live on through all the lives he inspired. In the words of the poet R.M. Rilke, ''I live my life in circles/that reach out across the world./I may not complete the last one,/but I give myself to it.'' Burial in Binyamina, Israel. Memorial service Tuesday, November 9, 2:30 p.m. Beir Chapel, Central Synagogue, 123 E. 55th St. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to Jacob Perlow Hospice at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan.
