        FOULK-Samuel S. We regret to announce the death from a heart attack of Samuel S. Foulk on June 19 in San Francisco. Sam was a Managing Director at PricewaterhouseCoopers and enjoyed a national reputation as a tax consultant, particularly in the field of Mergers and Acquisitions, where he was a leading expert in ''golden parachutes.'' Sam is profoundly missed by his family and an enormous number of friends across the country and indeed across the world. Since Sam's body has been donated to science, there will be no funeral. A memorial fund has been established to create a fellowship named in his honor at the Martin Luther King Jr. School of Law, UC Davis. Those wishing to contribute should send their donations to: UC Davis Foundation/Samuel S. Foulk Memorial Fund, 508 2nd Street, Suite 203, Davis, CA 95616. A Memorial Celebration of Sam's life is planned for 2pm, Sunday, August 18, in the Carnelian Room, Bank of America Building, 555 California Street, San Francisco. All Sam's friends are invited to attend. Eileen M. Feild (nee Foulk) Nancy Foulk Margaret M. Foulk David A. Traill
