        DICHTER-Harold. We mourn the passing of a lifelong friend and partner and we will miss his indomitable spirit, his passionate devotion to family and friends. Our deepest sympathy is extended to his beloved wife Ethel, and his daughter Rochelle, and all their dear ones. Alice and Bernard Leyden
