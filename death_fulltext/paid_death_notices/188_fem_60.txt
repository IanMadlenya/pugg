Her mother was a medical doctor and her father was a pharmacist, chemist, and perfumer, owning several pharmacies. She loved going to Jones Beach and spending weekends with her relatives. She was the oldest of three children, predeceased by her sister Leila Wager and survived by her brother Aldrich Krepela. She attended Hofstra University and Ohio Wesleyan College, where she was a Phi Beta Kappa. She pursued a career as an officer in the U.S. Air Force where she met her true love, James Johnson. They had three children, Adrienne, Helen, and Ken. They traveled throughout Europe and the United States, retiring in south Florida to be near her parents. She enjoyed attending cooking classes and creating gourmet cuisines. She also loved to paint ceramics and was exceptional at creating flowers. She loved gardening and grew a variety of fruit, flowering, and palm trees. She liked to fish and crab for ''blues.'' In later years she became an avid reader and was fondly known as ''Mrs. Webster.'' The daily crossword was but little challenge to her. She loved her grandchildren immensely and they became her focus after the loss of her husband. She had eight: Andrew, Gienah, Robert, Victor, Austin, Conrad, Kaitlyn Danielle, and Adrienne Caitlyn. She will be missed enormously by her family, friends, and her beloved dogs.
