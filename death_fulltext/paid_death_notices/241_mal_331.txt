After serving as a sergeant in the U.S. Army in World War II, he returned home to become a C.P.A. His business career led him to become President of the National Sugar Refining Company (Jack Frost). Upon retirement, he became an advisor to the Sol Goldman (real estate) family. He was an active member in the Jewish communities in Bellmore and Merrick, Long Island. He delighted in the joys of seven grandchildren, Alex, Sabrine, and Eve Bilger and Etan, Dannie, Micah, and Josh Epstein. Throughout his life he maintained an abiding affection for his high school buddies and their spouses known as the Petrons. He will be missed by many adoring family members. We were blessed to know him and will always cherish our shared moments of laughter, song, and celebration.
