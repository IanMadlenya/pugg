        COHEN-Eli. It is with deep sorrow and regret that we mourn the untimely passing of our friend and esteemed partner, Eli Cohen. From his start in the firm in 1958 until his retirement in September 2000, Eli spent his entire professional career at the firm. With that came a keen business sense and remarkable vision. As Co-Managing Partner from 1992 to 2000, Eli's leadership and guidance is considered a tremendous factor in making the firm the success it is today. Known as ''Flash'' because of his ability to get a job done quickly, Eli's energy was an infectious force felt by all. He was not only our business partner but a cherished friend whose intellect and good humor will be sorely missed. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife Marilyn, his daughters Jill and Laurie, their husbands Eddie and Michael and his adored grandchildren. We will all miss you.
