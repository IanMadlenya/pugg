        NABATOFF-Robert A., M.D. It is with profound sorrow that The Mount Sinai Alumni mourns the passing of our friend and colleague, Dr. Robert Nabatoff, a highly esteemed physician whose remarkable career at Mount Sinai covered almost half a century. Based on his significant research contributions, his caring and expert care of his patients, and his devoted and loving service to Mount Sinai, he served as Clinical Professor of Surgery until his retirement in 1986. In 1965, The Mount Sinai Alumni presented its most coveted award, the Jacobi Medallion, to Dr. Nabatoff in acknowledgment of his profound professional achievements and his extraordinary service to the Medical Center and The Alumni. Active for many years in The Alumni, he served as President in 1971. He will be remembered for his exceptional skill, special warmth, and outstanding commitment to Mount Sinai. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his family. Jeffrey S. Freed, M.D., President William G. Stein, M.D., Vice Pres. Maria L. Padilla, M.D., Secretary George Raptis, M.D., Treasurer
