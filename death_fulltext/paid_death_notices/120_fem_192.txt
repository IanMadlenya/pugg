        NEWHOUSE-Bertha S. I wish to express our faculty's sadness on the occasion of the death of our long time and esteemed colleague, Bertha S. Newhouse. Her illustrious career ending as a Professor of Accounting began in 1946 and lasted until her retirement in 1985. She was the first woman CPA to teach in the School, to reach the rank of full professor in accountancy, and to serve as associate dean in the School of Business. We who knew her remember her as a dedicated colleague and friend. We offer our condolences to her beloved husband Roy Newhouse, her children Lina and Martin and her five grandchildren. Sidney I. Lirtzman, Dean Baruch School of Business Baruch College, CUNY
