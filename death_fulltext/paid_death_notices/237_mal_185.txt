        $(6$)ISAACS--Harvey A. (1935-2006) It is with sadness that we bid farewell to Harvey A. Isaacs, who was managing partner of Tompkins & Davidson, LLP until his recent retirement and assumption of Of Counsel status to the firm. We will miss his experienced counsel. Harvey took great joy in his many years of service to the national customs broker and forwarder community, and the many clients he served in his forty-plus years as a practicing attorney and as a managing partner at both Siegel, Mandell & Davidson, P.C. and Tompkins & Davidson, LLP. Harvey earned the highest respect of all he encountered and his many friendships attest to this. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife Florence, his sons Jonathan and Andrew, daughter-in-law Katie, his brothers Shelly and Jerry, and the rest of his family in this time of both sorrow and remembrance.
