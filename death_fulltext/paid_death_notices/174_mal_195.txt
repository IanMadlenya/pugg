        YUE-Shyh-Jong, M.D. The American College of Acupuncture mourns the loss of a colleague, mentor and friend, Jack, who over the past three decades trained hundreds of physicians and dentists in the practice of acupuncture. His wisdom and guidance helped formulate the New York State Educational Standards. He was awarded registration number 002, the second person certified to practice acupuncture in New York State. Giving his time unselfishly, he was the founding President of the American College of Acupuncture. He helped establish the New York Society of Acupuncture for Physicians and Dentists, presided as its President, and guided the Society in educational tours to Taiwan, France, Australia and China. Trained as both an orthopaedic surgeon and rehabilitation specialist, Dr. Yue was the Director of Rehabilitation Medicine at Saint Luke's and Clinical Associate Professor in Rehabilitation Medicine at Columbia P&S. Condolences to his wife Nai Gi, an accomplished artist, and to his son David and family. Sung Liao, M.D. Alfred Peng, M.D., Peter Teng, D.D.S. Mathew Lee, M.D. Board of Directors
