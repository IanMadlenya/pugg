        MEYER-Schuyler. In loving memory of our gentle and gracious friend, a true ''honorary member'' of the Sisters of the Good Shepherd. We treasure his friendship and remember his generous support of our work. Both at Good Shepherd Services and Center for Family Life, Schuyler has left a rich legacy of help and hope for children and families. We extend our prayers and condolences to his family and the Edwin Gould Foundation. The Sisters of the Good Shepherd
