        SIEGFRIED-Charles A. Franklin and Marshall College of Lancaster, PA, acknowledges with sorrow the passing of Charles A. Siegfried. A 1930 graduate of The College with Phi Beta Kappa honors, Mr. Siegfried went on to an illustrious career with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, where he eventually served as President from 1966 to 1969. After that, he was Vice Chairman and later Chairman of The Executive Committee before his retirement in 1973. His distinguished service to Franklin & Marshall included tenure on the College's Board of Trustees, with seven years as The Board Chair in the 1970's. His vision, leadership and commitment to the College will be missed.
