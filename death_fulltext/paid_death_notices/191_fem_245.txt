        EISENBERGER-Agnes. Died peacefully on December 26 at Lenox Hill Hospital, NYC. In loving memory of our friend and colleague, whose inspirational leadership, deep musicality and intuitive encouragement guided countless artists throughout her 40 years at Colbert Artists Management. Her special gift was the recognition and nurturing of musical talent, a gift to which she brought a brighteyed and boundless enthusiasm combined with a quiet confidence which bolstered the dreams of her artists and brought their most ambitious professional aspirations to fruition. She was tireless in her perserverance and extravagant in her generosity, never demanding more of her staff than she did of herself. She was deeply loved by all who knew her. A memorial service will be held on Tuesday, January 14, at 5:30 pm at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Ave (at 81st St), phone 212288-3500. Dearest Agnes, we will miss you!
