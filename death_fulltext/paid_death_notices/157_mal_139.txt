        ROBERTS-Stephen M. One week ago today God welcomed you to His home. You will live on in our home, our safe haven always. Your unconditional love and friendship, your infectious optimism, sunny disposition and smile, your loyalty, boundless generosity will live on in my heart. Our time together, although too short, has provided me enough happiness to last a lifetime. The sun will shine forever through the window of my heart that you opened. Remember Tuesday. Our Love, Susan, Bubba and Blondie
        ROBERTS-Steve. The Employees of Contempora Fabrics, Inc., would like to honor the memory of our good friend, Mr. Steve Roberts of Charlene Fabrics.
        ROBERTS-Steven Michael. In memory of my good friend, Stevie. I will always cherish the laughs and the jokes and the advice we gave one another in a time of need. I will continue to support what meant most to you in your life, your business and your charitable causes. Your friend, who misses you, Marty Sklar. I thought I would go first.
