        FREEDMAN-Henry, M.D. The Board of Regents, Administration, Medical Staff and the staff of the Mary Polak Oenslager Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of The Long Island College Hospital mourn the loss of Dr. Henry Freedman, professor and former director of the department of obstetrics and gynecology. Dr. Freedman started as a resident at the hospital in 1933, becoming a full attending physician and professor of clinical obstetrics/ gynecology by 1957. In 1966, he was asked to head the department of obstetrics/gynecology where he served as director through his retirement in 1979. He was a caring physician, dedicated to his patients and the hundreds of residents he taught during his career at LICH. Dr. Freedman also served as president of the hospital's medical staff, and was active in the New York Obstetrical Society and the Brooklyn Gynecological Society. We extend our most sincere condolences to his wife Arlene and his family. Joseph L. Broadwin, Chairman Board of Regents Donald F. Snell, Pres. and CEO Daniel D. Ricciardi, MD President, Medical Staff Jack E. Maidman, MD, Chairman The Mary Polak Oenslager, Dept of Obstetrics/Gynecology The Long Island College Hospital
