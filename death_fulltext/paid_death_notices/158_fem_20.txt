        LEW-Norma. The members of Memoria Activa (Active Memory) of Argentina sadly mourn the passing of their President and CoFounder. Valiant Norma led us in our fight to find truth and justice in the case of the AMIA Buenos Aires Jewish Community Center bombing in 1994. Norma miraculously survived the attack while her eldest son Agustin was killed in the explosion along with the other 85 victims. Our hearts are with her family. May her memory be a blessing.
