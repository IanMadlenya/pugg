Beloved wife of the late Harold Fisher, loving and devoted mother of Ann Tuteur (Robert) of Horsham, Pennsylvania, and Sanford Fisher of New York, and adoring grandmother of Steven, Melissa, Michael and Jonathan Tuteur, and Lauren and Jason Fisher.

She lived every day of her life to the fullest and was happiest when she was surrounded by her family, when she attended performances every other Saturday afternoon at the Metropolitan Opera, and when she was at work as a volunteer at the Membership Desk at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Funeral services on Sunday, January 27th, at 11am at Central Synagogue, Lexington Avenue at 55th Street. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Opera, or Central Synagogue.
