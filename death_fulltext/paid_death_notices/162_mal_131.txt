        KARSKI-Jan. The officers, members and staff of the American Jewish Committee deeply mourn the death of Jan Karski, a courier of courage. Jan Karski was a diplomat, a Righteous Gentile, a messenger for the Polish underground resistance during World War II, and an eyewitness to the systematic Nazi extermination of the Jews in Poland. He risked his own life to report the unimaginable atrocities he had seen to the Polish, British and American governments and to plead for help in saving Jewish lives. Modestly referring to himself as a ''human tape recorder'', he was, in actuality, a trumpet, heralding the harsh tones of human indifference and cruelty while at the same time personifying the indomitable spirit and inherent goodness that mankind can still possess. He devoted his postwar life to protecting the memory of the victims of the Holocaust, combating anti-Semitism and intolerance, and advancing the cause of human rights. In 1933, the AJC bestowed our highest honor on Jan Karski, and in 1999, he was the first recipient of the Eternal Light Award from the Center for Catholic/Jewish Studies, a collaboration of AJC and Saint Leo University. With great sorrow we now bid farewell to a dear frienda gentleman and a gentle man of enormous personal courage and profound moral integrity. We will cherish his memory as near to our hearts as he cradled the souls of the millions or Jews he never knew but tried to rescue. Bruce M. Ramer, President David A. Harris, Excutive Director
