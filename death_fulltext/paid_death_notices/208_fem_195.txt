        CUTLER--Deirdre. The family of Deirdre Cutler remember fondly the presence of such a boundless soul in our lives. Many words can be used to describe Deirdre. Wife, mother, sister and friend are those that define her best. Motherhood was her greatest dream and possession. She recognized that success in life was little if not matched with the true possession of the joys of family. Deirdre lived a life anchored in the steadfastness of her convictions. Her determination, strength and dignity when faced with adversity is an inspiration and comfort to all those whose lives she touched. In our time of grief we are comforted by the warmth of our memories of Deirdre in our lives. The brothers and sisters of Deirdre Cutler
