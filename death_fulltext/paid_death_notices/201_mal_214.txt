        PUFFER--Ted. The Manhattan School of Music deeply mourns the passing of Ted Puffer, a distinguished member of the voice faculty since 1994. His intellect, energy and compassion have had an enormous impact on generations of singers who have performed on opera stages worldwide. As a colleague and friend he will be sorely missed by all. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his family. David A. Rahm, Chairman, Board of Trustees Marta Istomin, President
