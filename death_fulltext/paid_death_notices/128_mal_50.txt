        SCHWARCZ-Dean Ernest. The Central Queens YM & YWHA records with profound sorrow the passing of Dean Ernest Schwarcz. An outstanding and distinguished community leader, his vision was responsible for the establishment of the Rabbi Simon Hevesi Jewish Heritage Library, a Jewish public library, located in the Y building. He was an inspiration to all who were fortunate enough to have known him. To his wife, Marta, we extend our deepest sympathy. Craig Goodman, President Judith Friedman Rosen, Chairman of the Board
