        GLUCKSMAN--Lewis L. The entire New York University community deeply mourns the death of Lewis L. Glucksman, esteemed alumnus, admired trustee, magnificent benefactor, and cherished friend. After receiving his M.B.A. degree from NYU, he went on to fulfill the promise of his education: he had an outstanding career in finance that included the chairmanship of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., the positions of co-chief executive, president, and chief operating officer of Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb, and the post of executive vice-president of Fireman's Fund Insurance Company. His generous support of NYU's business school made possible the Lewis Glucksman Institute of Research in Securities Markets, enhancement of the library, and the creation of fellowships in support of the school's faculty. He also served the school with noted distinction as a professor of business administration. In addition, with his wife, Loretta Brennan Glucksman, his generosity led to the creation of NYU's renowned Glucksman Ireland House. Our community will cherish the memory of this generous and wise, kind and good man, and his wonderful legacy of achievement. We are comforted in knowing that he left us surrounded by family and friends in Ireland, a country he so deeply loved, where private services will be held, and that our community will be able to take part in a memorial service in New York anticipated to take place in September. We express our profound and deepest sympathy to his dear and beloved wife, Loretta, and the entire family Martin Lipton, Chair, NYU Board of Trustees John Sexton, President, NYU
