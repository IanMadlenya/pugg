        TOPF--Sam. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) are deeply saddened by the loss of Dr. Sam B. Topf of Aventura, Fla., one of our towering leaders, and most devoted and beloved friends. Honorary chairman of the Southern Region, Dr. Topf tirelessly and joyfully served the ATS, the Technion and Israel as president and chair of the Southern Region, a dynamic leader of the ATS National Board of Directors and the Technion International Board of Governors, and life trustee of the Board of Regents. He also inspired the creation of one of our most popular and effective outreach tools, the ''Why Technion?'' brochure. A Technion Guardian along with his late wife Eve, their unstinting generosity is evident throughout the Technion campus, most notably at the Eve Topf Neurodegenerative Disease Research and Teaching Center of Excellence, dedicated to the eradication of maladies such as Parkinson's Disease. Their unwavering commitment also includes the Sam and Eve Topf/Miami Dormitory and the Sam and Eve Topf Miami Manufacturing Entrepreneurial Center, as well as the Southern Region Technion Emergency Fund for Soviet Immigrant Absorption and vital student scholarships. We extend our heartfelt condolences to their children and spouses, Joel and Pat Weissman, Rhona and Gary Leggiere, Steven and Joanne Weissman, Frances and Barry Hesser, Jeffrey and Mary Topf; their grandchildren and great-grandchildren; and the entire Topf Family.
