        ROWLEY-Louis N. Jr. The Board of Trustees, President David Chang, Chancellor George Bugliarello, the Faculty, Alumni, Staff and Students of Polytechnic University note with profound regret the passing of Louis N. Rowley, Jr., a 1931 graduate in mechanical engineering and 1976 Honorary Doctorate recipient, who served his alma mater proudly, generously and wisely as former chairman of the Board of Trustees, former president of the Alumni Association and trustee for more than 40 years. In 1973, as board chairman, he presided over the merger of the New York School of Engineering and Science into the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, now Polytechnic University. His commitment and success in the field of mechanical engineering is evidenced in his service as former president of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, recipient of Polytechnic's 1963 Distinguished Alumnus Award and his work at McGraw-Hill Publcations, where he was editorial chairman of ''Power'' and ''Electrical World'' magazines. The Polytechnic community expresses its heartfelt condolences to his family and friends.
