        DIMITROVA--Ghena. Opera Orchestra of New York notes with sorrow the death of soprano Ghena Dimitrova, who made her New York debut in Opera Orchestra's ''Nabucco'' in May, 1984. At that performance, critic Donal Henahan noted the audience ''...bellowed and stomped until the floor boards rocked'' showing its enthusiasm for this wonderful artist. Two years later, also with Opera Orchestra, she sang the title role in ''La Gioconda'' to great acclaim. Her glorious voice and extraordinary talent will long be remembered. Alfred F. Hubay, President Eve Queler, Music Director
