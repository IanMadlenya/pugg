        FEININGER--Wysse.Was born in Stockholm, Sweden on May 8, 1912 and died in her sleep in her Manhattan apartment on March 3, 2006. Mrs. Feininger, nee Gertrud Hagg, completed primary and secondary education at the French School in Stockholm before enrolling at The Bauhaus where she studied graphic design. In 1933 she moved back to Stockholm and married Andreas Feininger. Their son, Tomas, was born two years later. In Sweden, Mrs. Feininger designed and painted porcelain at Gustavsberg in part under the guidance of her uncle, Wilhelm Kage, one of the outstanding ceramists of his time. As the clouds of war darkended the sky of Europe, her husband (who held US citizenship) decided to pull up roots and on December 6, 1939, the family sailed from Bergen, Norway, to New York on board the Oslofjord. In New York, and later in Connecticut, Mrs. Feininger worked as commercial illustrator and illustrator of children's books. When her husband joined Life magazine as a staff photographer in 1942, she increasingly became his ''girl Friday'', a role that he warmly acknowledged on many occasions. Even after he left the magazine in 1963, Mrs. Feininger carried on as her husband's helper and muse until he put aside his cameras for the last time in the mid 1990s. He died in 1999 and carried on for several years distributing many of his photographs to museums and cultural institutions. Mrs. Feininger is survived by her son, Tomas, a geologist, living in Quebec, three granddaughters, Anna and Ingrid of Ottawa, Canada and Erica, who lives in Massachusetts, three great-granddaughters, as well as numerous other relatives in Sweden.
