        ABBELL-Dora. The administration, faculty, students and boards of the Jewish Theological Seminary record with sorrow the passing of Dora Abbell, whose generosity and that of her family have benefitted the Seminary for decades. Along with her beloved husband, Joseph, a Chicago businessman, Mrs. Abbell has been a prime supporter of the Seminary's worldclass library. A lively individual whose guiding principle was helping others in need, Mrs. Abbell created a home in which Jewish traditions played a central role. She will be deeply missed by her husband, daughter, Louise A. Holland and grandchildren, Elizabeth and Ethan. May her memory be for a blessing. Ismar Schorsch, Chancellor Gershon Kekst, Board Chairman
