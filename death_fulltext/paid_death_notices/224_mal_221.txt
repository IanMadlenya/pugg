        VACCHIANO--William. The New York Philharmonic deeply mourns the passing, on September 19, of William Vacchiano, who joined the Orchestra's trumpet section under Arturo Toscanini in 1935 and served as Principal Trumpet from 1942 to 1973, never missing a performance in 38 years. He was a legendary teacher at The Juilliard School, where his more than 2,000 students included the Philharmonic's Principal Trumpet Philip Smith, Miles Davis, Wynton Marsalis, and Donald Byrd. We extend our condolences to his daughter, Joanne. Lorin Maazel, Music Director Members of the Orchestra Paul B. Guenther, Chairman Zarin Mehta, Pres./Exec. Dir. Members of the Staff
