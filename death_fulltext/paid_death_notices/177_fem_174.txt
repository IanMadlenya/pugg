        KAISER-Barbara. The staff and Board of the American Civil Liberties Union note with great sadness the passing of Judge Barbara Kaiser on September 26th. Judge Kaiser was a dedicated civil libertarian and a passionate advocate for women's rights. She began her formal affiliation with the ACLU in 1972 as a member of the Board of Directors of the organization's New York affiliate - a position she held until 1981. We extend our condolences to Barbara Kaiser's family for their great loss.
