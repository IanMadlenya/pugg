        RAND-Jean MacNeish. On June 13, 2000. Daughter to Harris Franklin MacNeish and Elizabeth Stockton, sister to Richard ''Scotty'' MacNeish. She earned a degree in art from Columbia University and went on to work at the American Museum of Natural History. She was an artist, teacher, gardener, writer and genealogist, having authored Some Descendants of Jan Aertsen Vanderbilt. A shining light to all who knew her, she was a humble and gentle creature and the most generous of spirits. She leaves behind her husband, Samuel Arthur Rand, son Richard Stockton Rand, daughter Martha Elizabeth Rand, and two beloved grandchildren, Samantha Louise and Elaine Stockton. She will be dearly missed. A gathering of friends (today) Thursday, June 15, from 2-5 PM and 7-9:30 PM at Thomas F. Dalton Funeral Home, 125 Hillside Avenue, New Hyde Park (at City Line)
