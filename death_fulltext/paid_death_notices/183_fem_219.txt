        GOLDSMITH-Janet Fox. On April 22, 2002, in Palm Beach, Florida. Formely of New York City and Shelter Island. She brought a lifetime of love and laughter to Henry, her husband of 58 years and to her daughter/son-in-law, Julie and Francis Daniel. She was an accomplished member of Broadways ''working actor'' community with a long list of credits in all media, theatre, radio, tv and film. She was a proud dues paying member of all 3 performing arts unions, Equity, Sag, and Aftra. It was one of her teasing mantras ''I can always go to Englewood.'' She did not. But if you wish, you can contribute to the Actors Fund in her memory. She'd appreciate it.
