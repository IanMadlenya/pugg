        GINDEK - Joanne Lesko. Joanne Lesko Gindek died peacefully in Ridgefield, Connecticut on February 17, 2003 at the age of 66. Born in Danbury, Connecticut, Joanne was the daughter of George M. Lesko, an army captain in World War II, and Zillah Ellis Lesko, a renowned children's book illustrator. Educated at the prestigious Pratt Institute in New York City, Joanne was regarded as one of the most influential, talented, creative individuals in the cosmetics industry. In four decades, working in her own firm and with industry giants, she created over 150 cosmetic packaging, merchandising and advertising designs that set the pace in beauty, elegance and glamour for the industry. In her work as in her private life, Joanne radiated restraint and strength. She was at her best under a crunch with a defiant resolve to make things happen no matter what. Her style was timeless, her charm without blemish, her grace under pressure unassailable. She faced down the diagnosis of cancer with her usual style and composure. The true measure of a woman is not in the wealth she leaves behind but the richness of the memories she gave to others. In that respect Joanne was the most successful woman, we know. Joanne is survived by Leslie Rowe, her family and friends who miss her companionship and treasure her memory. Friends will be received on Friday from 7-9:00 PM at the Hull Funeral Home, 60 Division Street, Danbury, Connecticut. Funeral Services will be held at the Hull Funeral Home, Saturday, February 22, 2003 at 10:30 AM. Burial will follow at Mountain Grove Cemetery in Bridgeport, Connecticut.
