        GRUBEL-Fred. It is with great sadness that the Officers, Directors and Staff of the Leo Baeck Institute, NY, note the loss of our great friend and mentor, Dr. Fred Grubel. Under his leadership the LBI established itself as the internationally recognized resource for documentation on German-speaking Jewry before the Holocaust. Dr. Grubel's personal relations with so many of those who were forced to flee Hitler's terror confirmed the need to preserve the heritage that they left behind. He was committed to building the Institute's comprehensive library, archives, photo, and memoir collections; he was diligent in encouraging original research in all areas of German-Jewish history; he was eager to foster young scholars by giving them the benefit of his advice and experience. To his cherished and wonderful wife Lisa, his children and his grandchildren, we share your sorrow and extend heartfelt sympathy. Ismar Schorsch, President Carol Kahn Strauss, Exec. Dir.
