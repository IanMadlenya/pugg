She was 89 years old. Dorothy spent her childhood in Brooklyn and performed with her late sister, Ethel, in a singing, dancing sister act for many years. They were featured on radio and at clubs in the metropolitan area. She turned down an opportunity to tour with the Rockettes when she married the late Stanley Bernard Karpel. They had two children, Wendy K. Kreitzman and Dr. Jill P. Karpel. During WWII, while her husband was serving in the army, she worked for the government on Governor's Island. Widowed very early, she raised her two daughters alone, working first as an interior designer for the growing housing field on Long Island, and then after she moved to Manhattan, she worked in advertising. Dorothy Zwiren Karpel is survived by her children Wendy and Ralph Kreitzman, and Jill Karpel and Robert Lynn, and her grandchildren, Susan Kreitzman Walczuk and her husband Matthew, Emily Kreitzman and her fiance Jason Wachtel, and Elizabeth Lynn.
