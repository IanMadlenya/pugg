        MILLER--Gerda. Congregation Rodeph Sholom mourns the death of our founding Nursery School Director, Gerda Miller. As an expert in the field of Early Childhood Education, Mrs. Miller came to Rodeph Sholom in 1958 and developed a caring and nurturing environment for young children to learn. By the time she retired in 1975, the Nursery Program had greatly expanded and led to the creation of the Rodeph Sholom Day School, grades K-8. Our deepest sympathy is extended to her nephew Peter Rosendahl, and all their dear ones. Robert N. Levine, D.D., Senior Rabbi Nancy Solomon, President
