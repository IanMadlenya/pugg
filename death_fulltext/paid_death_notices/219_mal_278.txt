        KELMAN--Captain Peter B. The employees of Hugo Neu Corporation are deeply saddened by the loss of Captain Peter B. Kelman, a business associate of the Company for nearly 40 years, who for the past 19 years was also the father-in-law of Hugo Neu's CEO, John L. Neu. Peter headed his own firm of marine surveyors, Peter B. Kelman & Sons, a Lloyds Surveyor and Hugo Neu's principal marine surveyor in its extensive export business. Peter was internationally recognized for his skill and professionalism and respected by shippers and customers throughout the world. Peter exemplified honesty and integrity. He instilled in his six children the importance of a strong work ethic and the need to contribute to society. He raised the bar for courage and bravery by the manner in which he lived and died with ALS. We are grateful that Peter's children, Wendy Neu (wife of John Neu, our CEO), Bob, and Pete continue the Kelman legacy at Hugo Neu Corporation and are making significant contributions. Our hearts go out to Peter's wife, Kathleen, and Wendy, Zoe, Sally, Bob, Jackie, Pete and their families at this sad time.
