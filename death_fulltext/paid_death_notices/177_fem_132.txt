        O'CONNOR-Diana J. (nee Vega). With deep sorrow, we mourn the passing of our dear Diana, who was taken from us tragically in the attack on the WTC on September 11, 2001. Beloved and devoted wife of Bill, devoted and caring mother to Amanda Rose O'Connor. Cherished daughter of Maria and the late Joaquin Vega. Truly loved as a daughter by Marion and Michael O'Connor. Loving sister to all of her siblings and their spouses. Dearly loved sister-in-law to Debbie, Rosemary, Lisa and Michael O'Connor. Adored aunt of many nieces and nephews. Managing Director and devoted employee of Sandler O'Neill Partners. Diana strived to live the word of God. She was a gentle and humble spirit, a peacemaker, and generous to a fault. She approached every day with courage and determination. She acted quietly & ardently to alleviate others' pain. She gave graciously & she asked for nothing in return. She was a gift from God. It was a privilege to know and to be loved by our precious Diana. A Memorial Mass will be held at 11 A.M. on October 27th at St. Luke's Church in Whitestone, Queens. Those who wish to honor Diana may contribute to the Diana O'Connor Memorial Trust, which has been established for the care and education of her daughter, Amanda Rose, P.O. Box 41, Eastchester, New York 10709.
