        REGAN--Donald T. 1918-2003. Wally Findlay Galleries deeply mourns the death of our esteemed friend and painter. Donald Regan's third phase as a painter captured his subject matter with simple gestures and innocent perspective. His painting was a medium for his contemplation, cherished memories and a way to touch the heart. We have been privileged to have known him and to represent him as an artist. Our deepest sympathy to his loving wife, Ann, and to his family. James R. Borynack, Chairman and CEO and the entire Wally Findlay Galleries Staff >>AD#
