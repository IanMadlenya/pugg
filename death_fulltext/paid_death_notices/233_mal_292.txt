        NACHT--Carl H., M.D. The entire St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center family acknowledges with profound sadness the untimely passing of our dear friend and devoted colleague, Carl H. Nacht, M.D., who earned the respect and admiration of all of us for his constant devotion to his patients and his profession. As Medical Director for West Care Medical Associates, SLR's multi site primary and specialty practice, Carl was principally responsible for the oversight of the medical care provided to thousands of New Yorkers. He also served as President of River to River Medical Associates, a multi site voluntary medical practice with which SLR also has enjoyed a longstanding relationship. Carl did his medical training at SLR, was very involved with the Hospital Center's Medical Board and its various committees and was an active participant in its teaching and training programs. He will be greatly missed by all who knew him and worked with him--but most especially by those who turned to him for help. To his beloved wife Mary Beth, daughter Zoe, son Asher, and all of his family and loved ones, we extend our heartfelt condolences. Morton P. Hyman, Chairman Board of Trustees Richard F. Daines, M.D. President and CEO Donna Mendes, M.D. President, Medical Board Michael Lesch, M.D. Chairman, Dept. of Medicine
