        EHRLING--Sixten. The Juilliard community mourns the death of Sixten Ehrling, a distinguished conductor and teacher who served on the Juilliard faculty from 1973-1987. An artist of supreme musical integrity and dedication, he will be missed by us all. His gift of several thousand of his scores to our collection benefits all who study here. We express our deepest condolences to his family. Joseph W. Polisi, President
