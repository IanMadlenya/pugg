        BYARD-Jaki. The Manhattan School of Music deeply mourns the untimely passing of venerable faculty member Jaki Byard. A renowned member of our jazz piano faculty since 1989, his personal, distinct and eclectic style along with his pure talent, vast experience, and affable presence will be sorely missed. We extend our most heartfelt condolences to his family. David A. Rahm, Chairman Board of Trustees Marta Istomin, President
