        BLACK-Morris. With profound sadness, the entire JBFCS community mourns the death of Morris Black, a special man with an extraordinary spirit. A gifted social worker, his career spanned 34 years at the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services (and predecessor Jewish Board of Guardians). As JBFCS Assistant Director and Director of Madeleine Borg Community Services, Morris was a creative thinker and a consistent advocate for clinical excellence. He continued to bring his wisdom to bear on the agency and to many of us personally, even in his retirement. Caring and unselfish, Morris was a man of warmth and humor. Loved and respected by Board and staff, he was always available with counsel and encouragement. His treasured wife Marge is an important member of the JBFCS family. Our heartfelt condolences to Marge and to his wonderful children and grandchildren who brought Morris great joy. We will miss him. Jean L. Troubh, President Joseph S. Kaplan, Chairman of the Board Alan B. Siskind, Ph.D. Executive Vice President and CEO Paul Levine, CSW Associate Executive Vice President
