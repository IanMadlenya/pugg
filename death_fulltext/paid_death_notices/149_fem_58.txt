        MESHOVER-Phyllis. The William Alanson White Institute and Society mourn the shockingly untimely death of an eminent and beloved colleague. An exquisite woman, Phyllis's petite grace might easily have belied gifts of heroic proportions had they not been so prominent: her profound passion for a joyful life lived in full measure; a prodigious intellect; and intense dedication to psychoanalysis and to her patients; an intrepid explorer on matters of gender and infertility; an inspiring, generous spouse and a consummate, incomparable mother. Like all who love her, we wish devoutly for more time with Phyllis to share both the ordinary and the extraordinary events of our lives. She will be with us in spirit and in love forever. Marylou Lionells, Ph.D., Direct, White Insitute Robert I. Watson, Jr., Ph.D., President, White Society
