        HALLENBECK--Luke J. The Washington Square Assn. and the Washington Square Music Festival mourn the passing yesterday of Luke J. Hallenbeck. Over the years, his enthusiasm, generous support and love of music and Greenwich Village offered all of us a standard to which we aspire. His rose garden was an annual delight.
