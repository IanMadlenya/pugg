        MEYER EPSTEIN--Ruth. Hoff - Barthelson Music School mourns the passing of Ruth Meyer Epstein, a longtime member of our Board of Trustees and dear friend of the School. Her kindness made it possible for generations of students to acquire the skills to express, experience and enjoy a lifetime of music. Our thoughts are with her family.
