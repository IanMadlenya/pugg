        COHEN--Julian. We at the Kravis Center for the Performing Arts have lost a dear friend and a remarkable gentleman who was truly a champion of the arts and humanity. As a Founder and board member since 1991, Julian Cohen, for whom the Kravis Centers Cohen Pavilion is named, applied his singular talents, time and considerable financial support to advance the Centers commitment to the community. We will miss you, Julian Cohen, but your devotion to the Kravis Center, the arts and to this community will live on for generations to come. Our heartfelt condolences go out to his loving wife and family. Alexander W. Dreyfoos, Board Chairman Judith A. Mitchell, Chief Executive Officer Kravis Center for the Performing Arts, West Palm Beach, Florida
