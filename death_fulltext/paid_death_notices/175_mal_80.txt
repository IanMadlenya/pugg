        HELLMAN-Jack. On August 7, 2001. Beloved husband of Anne, father and grandfather. Little Neck Jewish Center mourns the death of Jack Hellman, our esteemed member. His departure from this place has left our entire congregation shakened and bereaved. Our glory, our splendor has been diminished. A crown has been removed from us. He gave generously of his time and effort, his counsel and wisdom, expertise and his substance. He gave generously of himself to this institution. Little Neck Jewish Center will be forever remembered as the house that Jack built. The Congregation of the Little Neck Jewish Center Rabbi Joseph Prouser Rabbi Abraham P. Eckstein, Emeritus Cantor Julian Raber
