        PFLUEGER - Kiyi. The Trustees, Director and Staff of The Musuem of Fine Arts, Boston, mourn the passing of Kiyi Pflueger, who with her late husband Edward, formed one of the most distinguished collections of European ceramics of the 20th century. Noted for their connoisseurship and generosity, the Pfluegers rank among the most important benefactors of the Museum.
