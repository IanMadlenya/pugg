        GOLDSTONE-Florence. Died at her home on November 25. Her wit and intellect will be sorely missed by her son Robert and his wife Susan, her brother Dr Marcus Mintzer, and her grandchildren, David, Stephen and Susan Jane. She had taught French to thousands of Junior High School students and was herself an avid reader. The family requests that donations be made in her memory to the New York Public Library, 5th Ave & 42 St, NY, NY 10018.
