        BLUM--Daisy Oppenheim. We mourn the loss of our cherished life long friend, Daisy, wife of the late beloved Walter Charles Blum. Her extraordinary kindness, unfailing graciousness, her lively intelligence and delightful sense of humor was a treasured gift to all of us. She will be lovingly remembered not only by us, but by our extended family and friends whose lives she touched in many different ways. Selma, Lisa, Donna Hirsh Hanna Goldsmith Rebecca Geller
