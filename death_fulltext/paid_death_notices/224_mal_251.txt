        FUTTER--Victor. We are deeply saddened by the passing of our good friend and Director Emeritus Victor Futter. Vic was a great leader of Greenwich House as a member of the board for 20 years, providing invaluable counsel, leadership and support in numerous ways. We will miss his wisdom, expertise in nonprofit governance, and the infectious enthusiasm with which he recruited Board members. We extend our sincere condolences to his wife, Joan; his children, Jeffrey, Ellen and Deborah; and his entire family. George A. Davidson, Chair Board of Directors Roy Leavitt, Executive Director & CEO Greenwich House, Inc.
