        SCHAFFER--Ariel W. Formerly of Bronxville, NY, died December 19, 2004, in Lebanon, NH, after a short illness. A graduate of Sarah Lawrence College, with an M.A. in English Literature from Columbia University, she taught for a number of years in New Hampshire's College for Lifelong Learning. She was a doting grandmother and an accomplished poet, scholar and ceaseless reader, epitomizing the quest for knowledge in her daily life. She is survived by her loving husband of 53 years, David, of Franconia, NH, two children, Adrienne Smith of Bronxville, NY, and Jim Sullivan of Pebble Beach, CA, and her six devoted grandchildren, Ashley, Toby, Jonathan, Michael, Elisabeth and Angus. A Memorial Service will be held at a future date. ''One short sleep past, we wake eternally.''
