        KNUBEL-Frederick H. The Faculty, Staff and Alumni of Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism mourn the untimely death of Fred Knubel, Class of 1959. We express our sympathy to his widow, Judith Leynse, Class of 1962, and her sons. Fred's quiet dignity spoke volumes on behalf of the University as he told its story and history through his words and photographs. Tom Goldstein, Dean Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism
