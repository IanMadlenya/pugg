        BERLIN-Hilda. Born in Leeds, England in 1913, this vibrant woman came to America in the 1930's and spread her abundant cheer until her death on January 23, 2002. Our plucky Hillie showered us with her compassion, loyalty and love, and cooked her way into our hearts. She had a long and loving marriage with the late Milton Berlin, and will be fondly remembered by her son, Ronald Berlin and daughter, Vickie Klinger; her daughterin-law Stephanie Magdziak and son-in-law, Phil Klinger; her dear brother, Gilbert Pelham; her greatly beloved granddaughters, Michele Klinger and Sofia Berlin; her devoted nieces and nephews, and a great many faithful friends. A memorial service will be held at Parkside Memorial Chapels on Sunday, January 27 at 3 PM. The family would welcome contributions in her memory to the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens.
