        MIRANDA-Anthony. New York City Opera mourns the passing of Tony Miranda, a member of our orchestra for 17 years and Principal Horn player for 12. He was a valued member of our orchestra, a good friend, and we will miss him. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Sharon Moe, his children, and all his many friends. Visitation hours are on Thursday, November 16, from 3-5 PM and 4-9 PM, at Marble Collegiate Church, at 1 West 29 St. A memorial service will be held at the Church on Friday, November 17, at 11 AM.
