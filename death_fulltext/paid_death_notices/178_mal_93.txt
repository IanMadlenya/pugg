        JACOBS-Lawrence D., M.D. The passing of Larry Jacobs, a preeminent neurologist who personified the ideal of the compassionate physician, saddens all of us at Biogen. Larry was among the first to see the potential of interferon beta in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Today, as a result of his research and determination, more than 114,000 patients throughout the world use AVONEX (Interferon beta-1a) therapy to slow the progression of disability and minimize the number and severity of the exacerbations associated with MS. Larry was a close colleague and friend to all of us at Biogen. We established the Irvin and Rosemary Smith Chair in Neurology at the University of Buffalo School of Medicine in his honor in 1998. In his memory, we will continue to work toward finding improved treatments and the ultimate cure for this devastating disease. Our deepest condolences to Pam and their family. Burt A. Adelman, M.D. Executive Vice President Research and Development James C. Mullen President and CEO James L. Vincent Chairman of the Board Biogen, Inc.
