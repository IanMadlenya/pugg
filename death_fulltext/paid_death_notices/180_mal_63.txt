With unspeakable sadness and pain we mourn the sudden passing of Walter Rosenthal, cherished husband of Trudy, beloved and revered father of Debbie and Michael Ross & Susan and Mark Sperber, respected and treasured opa of Aaron, Tzipora, Yoni, Tami, Rachel and Ariella Ross and Elyssa, Sharona, and Leora Sperber, proud great - grandfather of Shmuel Yehuda and Chaya Tova and good friend to countless people throughout the world. The memory of his good nature and perpetual smile will light our lives forever. Shiva will be observed through Sunday in Rochester, New York.
