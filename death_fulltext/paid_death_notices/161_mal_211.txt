        SAGER-Joseph. On June 15, 2000, in Plantation, FL, age 92. Beloved father of Marilyn. Devoted brother of the late Rose Berman and Jack Sager. Cherished uncle, great-uncle, cousin, honorary grandfather and friend. A New Yorker for his first 72 years, he graduated from Fordham University Pharmacy School in 1927, and late served as president of his condo association.
