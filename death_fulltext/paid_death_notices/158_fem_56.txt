        McGERR-Rita. The Trustees, faculty and administration of Riverdale Country School deeply regret the passing of Rita McGerr, our respected colleague and friend, and extend our sympathies to her children, Celia Regan and Michael McGerr. Part of the school family for 50 years, she came to teach English in 1949, served as Director of College Guidance from 1977 until 1987, and was appointed to the Board of Trustees upon her retirement. We shall miss her wise counsel.
