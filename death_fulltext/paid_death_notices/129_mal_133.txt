        WOODARD-Robert A. The family of Robert A. Woodard notes with great sadness his passing on October 9, 1997 in Marietta, GA. After proud service during World War II as an Airforce pilot instructor, Robert began what was ultimately a forty-one year career in the chemical industry, first with Catalin and then with Ashland Chemical Company. Above all, he was a loving and devoted husband, father, and grandfather. His love will be sorely missed by his survivors, Jeanne Woodard, Susan Woodard, Robert and Laura Woodard and their two children, Nicole and Brendan. Services will be held at the Cathedral of the Incarnation in Garden City, New York, Tuesday October 14, 1997 at 1 P.M.
