        KAPLAN-Harold I., M.D. The officers and members of the NYUBellevue Psychiatric Society regret the untimely passing of Harold I. Kaplan, M.D., on January 15, 1998. Dr. Kaplan was Professor of Psychiatry at NYU School of Medicine and Attending Psychiatrist at Bellevue, Tisch, and Lenox Hill Hospitals. He was a caring and devoted physician to the thousands of patients he cared for over his long career. He was founding editor of The Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry, used by generations of psychiatrists in this country and around the world, having been translated into eleven languages. He was at work on the seventh edition at the time of his death. Dr. Kaplan served as treasurer of the NYU-Bellevue Psychiatric Society, of which he was a founding member. He was a graduate of New York University and received his Doctor of Medicine degree from New York Medical College in 1949 at the age of 21. He was a Life Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association, the American College of Physicians and the New York Academy of Medicine, a member of the Alpha Omega Alpha Honorary Medical Society, and the recipient of numerous awards that recognized his extraordinary talents and capabilities. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Nancy; to his children, Philip, Peter and Jennifer, to his colleagues, and to his many patients. Benjamin J. Sadock, M.D. President NYU-Bellevue Psychiatric Society
