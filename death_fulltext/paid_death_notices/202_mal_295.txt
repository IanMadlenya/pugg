        WACHENHEIM--Edgar, Jr. The Board of Directors and staff of The Guidance Center mourn the passing of Edgar Wachenheim, Jr., Honorary Chairman of the Board, gracious philanthropist, passionate advocate for social action and beloved friend. Generous with his time, wisdom and good counsel, he was a tireless volunteer who was admired for his leadership and adored for his warmth and down to earth manner. His love for all humanity was inspirational and will endure as a role model for all to emulate. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Elizabeth and their family.
