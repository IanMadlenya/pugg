        RAISLER-Robert K. The Board of Directors and staff of UJA-Federation of New York are deeply saddened by the death of Robert K. Raisler, a magnanimous friend whose dedication to the Jewish people will long be remembered. A witness to the turmoil and trials of the Twentieth Century, he supported the fledgling State of Israel at her birth, remaining ever steadfast in his devotion to Jews in need throughout the world. We extend our sincere sympathy to all the members of the family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair James S. Tisch, President Stephen D. Solender, Exec V.P.
