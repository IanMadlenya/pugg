The Union for reform Judaism mourns with profound sorrow the sudden death of Bill Kampf, of St. Paul, MN, a member of its Board of Trustees since 1997 and, since 2004, the president of the Union's Great Lakes Council. In a variety of roles, Bill served the Union with great devotion. We extend deepest condolences to his wife, Janet, and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem and may Bill's memory be for a blessing. Robert M. Heller, Chairman Rabbi Eric H. Yoffie, President
