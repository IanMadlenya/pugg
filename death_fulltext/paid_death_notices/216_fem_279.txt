        STEINBERGER -- Ilse. Died peacefully January 5, 2005, in Manhattan, aged 98. Mother of Erica Steinberger McLean and grandmother of Chloe Helene Gordon McLean, both of New York City, and widow of Harry Steinberger. Ilse Helene Bretschneider was born December 22, 1906, in Buffalo, New York, and moved to Oakland, California with her family following her high school graduation at 15. She later graduated with Great Distinction from San Jose State College, where she was elected to Phi Kappa Phi. A gifted teacher, Ilse taught elementary school first in Modesto, California, beginning in 1956, and then on the Monterey Peninsula until her retirement in 1974. In 1978 she moved to New York, where she served as a tutor in the public school system, a reader for Lighthouse International, and a founding member and treasurer of the Gamma Alpha chapter of Delta Kappa Gamma International, a professional honorary society of women educators. She is also survived by a brother, Herman Schleusener, of Lake-of-the-Pines, California. Ilse was a wonderful, positive presence, a loving individual who possessed an appreciation of both children and adults, a youthful enthusiasm - for books, ideas, new experiences - a generous heart, an enduring love of life and a great capacity for laughter. Services will be private.
