        CRAFT--Joy. Died peacefully of natural causes at her Manhattan home on April 2, 2005. Survived by her brother Arnold, sister-in-law Atsuko, nieces Rebecca and Lucille, cousins Lorraine, Pam, Alison and Benita and many loving friends and family around the planet. No-one was ever more appropriately named for Joy, truly possessed a joie de vivre. She will be remembered for her irrepressible humor, footloose spirit and talent for making fast friends, whether on a bus tour to Quebec or a dance floor in Vegas. Funeral service will be held April 8, 11AM, at Mount Moriah Cemetery, Fairview, N.J.
