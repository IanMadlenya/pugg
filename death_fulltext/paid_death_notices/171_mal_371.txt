        POWELL-Charles Gould. Died on April 20 at NY Hospital of complications arising from Lung Cancer; he was 72. Mr. Powell resided in NYC but has lived all over the world. In 1967 he opened what is arguably the first Pan-Asian restaurant in the USA in Wolfeboro, NH. Mr. Powell was a charming and endearing gentleman and will be missed by all whose lives he touched in particular his family, as he joins his beloved wife Norma in the next life. Services for Mr. Powell were held April 27 in Manhattan; burial will be in Wolfeboro, June 2. The family is gratefully accepting memorial gifts in his name to the American Cancer Society.
