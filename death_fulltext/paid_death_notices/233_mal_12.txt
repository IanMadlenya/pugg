        BERDY--William. Bill was a gentleman and a mensch. He died peacefully with a song in his heart. He'll always be remembered by his loving wife Lee, his daughters, Michelle, Lauren and Allison; sons-inlaw, Andrew Howland, John White and Bill Rosson and grandsons Walker, Tyler and Cole. Contributions in his memory may be made to BUNWC or Big Brothers. Services were held yesterday.
