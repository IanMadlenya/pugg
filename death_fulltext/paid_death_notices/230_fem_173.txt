        SANFORD--Louise R. (nee Ritter). 93, of Sarasota, FL, passed away Sunday, March 12, 2006 after a brief illness. Born and raised in Poughkeepsie, NY, she attended Vassar College and later married Charles W. Sanford of Arlington, NY. At the onset of WWII, Louise and Charlie moved with their first child to Baltimore, MD where Bendix Corporation employed Mr. Sanford. During the war, he oversaw Bendix sub-contracts for Defense Department weapons production, and Mrs. Sanford made a home for them in five different U.S. industrial centers. At war's end they had toured much of the eastern half of the U.S., and grown to a family of four. Post-war, they toured some parts again, Charlie leading and Louise with their two children following. She resstablished family homes and raised their son and daughter in Milwaukee, WI, St. Joseph and Benton Harbor, MI. Louise established new family bases, and honed a solid golf game, in Cleveland, OH, Greenwich, CT, and finally in Syracuse, NY. In 1971, empty-nesters Louise and Charlie Sanford retired to Vero Beach, FL where together they made still another home just for the two of them. After her beloved passed away in 1984, she relocated to Plymouth Harbor in Sarasota. Last Sunday, Mrs. Sanford made her final move. In addition to her beloved husband, her daughter Anne-Louise Welther of Naples, FL preceded her in death. Survivors include her son, Charles, Jr. and daughter-in-law Diane (nee Herro) of Chicago, IL, and her two granddaughters, Brooke Young of Chicago, and Deidre Sanford of Springdale, AR. Service have been held. Memorial contributions may be made to the American Heart, or Stroke, Asssociations.
