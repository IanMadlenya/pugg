        SHARFMAN--Rabbi Solomon J. Young Israel of Flatbush, its members, friends and congregants, mourn with deep sorrow, the passing of its beloved Rabbi Emeritus, who faithfully and devotedly served as the spiritual leader of our Congregation for 45 years. He was a towering figure of modern Orthodox Jewry, and in addition to the many organizations he served, he was considered a Dean of the American Orthodox Rabbinate. We extend our deepest and heartfelt sympathy to his family, to his beloved Aishet Chayil, Rebbetzin Libby Sharfman, and to his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren. May the Almighty console the mourners together with all the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Kenneth Auman, Rabbi Howard Weiss, President
