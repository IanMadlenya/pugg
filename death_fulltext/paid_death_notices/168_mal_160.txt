        KOHNSTAMM-Paul L. The Horace Mann community is deeply saddened by the death of our good friend and honorary trustee, Paul L. Kohnstamm '40. While a student at Horace Mann he became business manager to the Record, vicepresident of the Junior Class and a member of the Junior Varsity and Varsity football teams. Compassionate, erudite, a generous benefactor and a board member since 1950, he served as secretary to the board and played an important role in fundraising. His loyalty and devotion to the school are legendary, his wise counsel and kind acts inspirational. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Maisie, to his six children, to his sister, Elizabeth Kohnstamm Ogden '38, and to his brother, Richard Kohnstamm '44.
