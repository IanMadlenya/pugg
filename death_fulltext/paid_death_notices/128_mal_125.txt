        ESPOSITO-John A. District Attorney Charles J. Hynes and all the staff of the Kings County District Attorney's Office mourns the passing of our friend and colleague John A. Esposito. John was a volunteer Assistant District Attorney in the Kings County District Attorney's Office, who passed away on September 7th, 1997. He was a longtime community activist who among other positions, served as a six term member of the New York State Assembly from the 23rd Assembly District. In November 1992, he joined this Office to aid in the prosecution of those who victimize the elderly. My staff and I offer our sincere condolences to his wife Estelle, and his family. His dedication and service to the senior community of Kings County and to this Office will long be remembered. Charles J. Hynes District Attorney Kings County
