        DERBY-Rabbi Josiah. We mourn with profound sorrow the passing of our beloved colleague. He was the founding rabbi of the Rego Park Jewish Center in Queens, NY, a position he began as a student in 1941 and from which he retired as rabbi emeritus in 1983. In retirement, he served as founding rabbi of Congregation Beth Shalom of Coconut Creek, FL and was appointed its rabbi emeritus in 1987. He was a pioneer in our Solomon Schechter Day School movement in the 1950's and was a published biblical scholar. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Adele, children, Jeffrey, and our colleague, Rabbi Lavey Derby, and to all who were touched through his rabbinate. Rabbi Reuven Hammer, President Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Executive Vice President The Rabbinical Assembly
