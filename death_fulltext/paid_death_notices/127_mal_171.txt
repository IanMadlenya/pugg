        HAAS-Albert. The entire Department of Rehabilitation Medicine of the NYU School of Medicine is greatly saddened by the death of this distinguished colleague. Dr. Haas was one of the fathers of the field of Pulmonary Rehabilitation. He headed for many years the Pulmonary Rehabilitation Services, both at Bellevue and the Rusk Institute. His wise counsel will be missed by all of us. The French government has recognized the courageous services that his late wife, Sonia and he have rendered to the resistance movement during World War II by the Legion of Honor. Our deep expression of sympathy to his son, Francois who followed in his footsteps, and his wife Sheila, and their two children, Ariane & Alex. Memorial service will be held on Sunday, August 17, 1 P.M., Gramercy Park Memorial Chapel, 152 2nd Avenue, between 9th and 10th Streets. Mathew H. M. Lee, M.D., Acting Chairman, Dept. of Rehabilitation Medicine Bruce B. Grynbaum, M.D., Vice Chairman, Dept. of Rehabilitation Medicine
