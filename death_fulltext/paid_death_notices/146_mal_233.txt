        GLUCKSTERN - REISS - Joshua. Our Temple family mourns the loss of our beloved Hazzan. In the few years that he was with us, he endeared himself to all, both young and old. We shall sorely miss his sweet voice, exuberance, his sense of humor and hearty laugh. His passionate love of Hazzanut, Jewish liturgy and music were inspirational. We mourn with his wife Rabbi Karen, his parents Martin and Toby Gluckstern, his sister Laurie Wuhrman, his friends and colleagues.
