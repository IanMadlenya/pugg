        FOSTER--Ronald M. Jr. The Calhoun School Board of Trustees and the entire community mourn the passing of one of Calhoun's heroes. Ron served as Honorary Trustee, President of the Board and President of the Parents Association. His leadership and personal generosity were key elements in Calhoun's transformation to the vibrant community we enjoy today. We extend deepest condolences to Ron's wife Marcia and the entire family--many of whom are members of the multi-generational Foster legacy atCalhoun: children Alison (David), Chris '95, Geoff '96; grandsons Justin Bosch '00 and Max Bosch '07.
