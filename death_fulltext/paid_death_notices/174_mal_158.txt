        FISCHMAN-Bernard D. LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae, L.L.P., mourns with sorrow the July 11, 2001 passing of our beloved counsel and sage, Bernard D. Fischman. Known to all as Bernie, he was an extremely dedicated attorney, and at the time of his death was still active on behalf of many of his clients. Bernie joined LeBoeuf in 1994 as counsel, and his career as a lawyer spanned more than 64 years. Bernie was a truly altruistic human being, always looking for and finding ways to help everyone with whom he came in contact. He will be missed by all who knew him. We extend deepest condolences to his wife, Hilda, their children, Judith and Robert, and their grandchildren, Jesse, Joanna and Eliza.
