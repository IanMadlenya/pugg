        BOOKHALTER-Dr. Sophie. The Yeshiva University family mourns the passing of a dear friend, a respected philanthropist whose commitment to the strengthening of Jewish life is manifest in the establishment of YU's Sophie Bookhalter, M.D., Program in Jewish Continuity. The program will advance the University's various outreach efforts on college campuses in the US and abroad, in the community, and at other sites. We extend our heartfelt condolences to her sister, Kay Bobbin; niece, Barbara Joyce Bobbin; and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University David S. Gottesman, Chairman Board of Trustees
