        EISENBERG-Gertrude. The Board and staff of the Jewish Association for Services for the Aged note with sorrow the passing of the mother of JASA's esteemed Chief Operating Officer, Aileen Gitelson. Gertrude Eisenberg was a devoted wife, mother, grandmother and great grandmother. Our hearts go out to our colleague Aileen, her father Morris, her sister Miriam, and the entire family.
