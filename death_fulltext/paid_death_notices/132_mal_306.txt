        WILKOFF-Howard M. With profound sorrow, the leadership of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations notes the death of our Honorary Life Treasurer.

We convey heartfelt sympathy to his beloved wife Ida and all his dear ones. Jerome H. Somers, Chairman Rabbi Eric H. Yoffie, President Rabbi Alexander M. Schindler, President Emeritus
