        ALBECK--Suzy. Born in Paris, died in Berlin, on September 23, at the age of 72. Woman of the world. Beloved mother of Jacques and devoted grandmother, Suzy is the cherished sister of Allen Oster and sister-in-law of Carla Fine of NYC. Suzy's spirit and smile reflected a resilience shaped by a history of facing life's hardships by honoring the joy that each day brings. We will miss her kindness, her generosity, her laughter and her vital presence. Au revoir.
