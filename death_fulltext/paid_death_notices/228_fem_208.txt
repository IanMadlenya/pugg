        HARNEY - Margaret. With profound sorrow, the Horace Mann School deeply mourns the untimely passing of Margaret Harney, our beloved and esteemed teacher, colleague, friend and Horace Mann parent. A respected member of the Foreign Languages Department for over twenty-five years--a dedicated Latin teacher--Margaret epitomized the essence of wisdom and integrity in and outside the classroom. Her exacting standards for herself and for her students are legendary. Margaret graced us with her indomitable courage, humor, warmth and drive. Her unflagging optimism, her devotion to Horace Mann and love of her family are an inspiration to all. Our thoughts are with Margaret's family during this time of deep sadness. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to her husband, Edward Moran, to her daughter Caroline Moran HM 2006 and to the rest of her family. Margaret will be greatly missed. Dr. Thomas M. Kelly Head of School Robert J. Katz, 1965 Chair, Board of Trustees
