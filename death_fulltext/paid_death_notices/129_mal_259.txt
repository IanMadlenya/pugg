        LUSTICA-Stevan. To find a ''cure'' one must be ''a part of the cure'', and because of you who truly lived and fought with ''love, valor and compassion'' the ''cure'' will be yours and our dream come true. Stevan we will keep up that battle for you. With love and pride. John Dugdale and Stanley Hura
