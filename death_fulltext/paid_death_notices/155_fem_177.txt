        DEDMAN-Concha Mary. Died peacefully at home on December 17, age 87. She was a little piece of England on Irving Place. She left her mark on all who knew her, whether lifelong friends or passing acquaintances. There were so very many of both. And once a friend, always a friend. She is lovingly remembered by all of us and particularly the many children whose lives she enriched-themselves now grown ups. She made a difference in all of our lives. She will not be forgotten. Our thoughts are with her sister, Lalia, her son, Martin, and her granddaughter, Philippa. A Memorial Mass will be held at a later date. Bill and Sonya Dunham Amy and Richard Lyman
