        FEGAN-Mary (nee Hourigan). November 22 just shy of her 82nd birthday. Adored child of Jack Hourigan and Loretta Collins. Much loved mother of Annie, Laurie and Robert; best mother-in-law of Charles and Mary; and loving Grand Mary of Quinn Fegan. She leaves behind her bereft family and a multitude of loyal friends here and abroad, including her bowling buddies and fellow students. A faithful communicant to the end, may she rest in eternal peace. Memorial service to follow at later date.
