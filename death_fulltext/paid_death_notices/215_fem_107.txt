        COLER--Tina. The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) mourn the loss of Tina Coler of Pacific Palisades, Calif., a long-time, devoted friend. The beloved wife of the late Alexander Coler, who served on the ATS Board of Directors, Board of Regents and Technion International Board of Governors, Mrs. Coler reached Technion Guardian status--the highest level of support for the ATS, Technion and Israel-along with her late husband. Together, they founded the Coler California Visitors Center, which serves as a multi-media showcase for Technion activities and achievements for all campus visitors. The couple was honored with the Albert Einstein Award, the highest ATS honor, for their outstanding generosity. Mr. Coler, who developed some of California's largest hotels, was recognized with a Technion honorary fellowship. We extend our sincere condolences to their daughters Anita Brock, Barbara Goodman and Gayle Sirota, and the entire Coler family.
