        MURAVCHIK--Emanuel. The members of the Atran Foundation mourn the passing of our distinguished friend and colleague Manny Muravchik. A Foundation member representing the Jewish Labor Committee since 1977, and Director since 1984, Manny was a strong, balancing force, serving with objectivity and diligence in guiding the Foundation's charitable efforts. Our heartfelt condolences to his wife Miriam, and family. Diane Fischer, President
