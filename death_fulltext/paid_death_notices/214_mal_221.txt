        GRAY--Dr. Arthur. Those of us at HIP Health Plan of New York who knew Dr. Arthur Gray are deeply saddened by his passing. When we think about Dr. Gray and the time we spent with him, both as a colleague and friend, a true testimonial is the celebration of his life. He was a gentleman and a gentle man. He was good, kind, caring and thoughtful. He was personable, and was enjoyable to spend time with because of his wide interests and knowledge. Above all, Dr. Gray was dedicated to his work. He was widely admired for his ethics and wise counseling. Although Dr. Gray did not work for HIP Health Plan, he kept a close working relationship with HIP and HIP benefited from his experience. He was an exceptional orthopedist associated with the Queens/Long Island Medical Group, where he was also a member of the Board of Directors, and the North Shore University Hospital at Forest Hills, where he was Senior Vice President for Medical Affairs and Chief of Staff. Perhaps the essential factor in celebrating the life of a physician, especially this physician, Dr. Arthur Gray, is to observe that his patients knew that he cared about them, and that so many of them thrived under his care. We extend our profound sympathy to his beloved wife, Sigrid, and to his daughters, Nichole and Heather, and other members of Dr. Gray's family. Anthony L. Watson, Chairman & CEO Daniel T. McGowan, President & COO
