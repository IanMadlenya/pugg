        PERLMAN-Ivan Lee. Of New York City and Durham, NH, passed away at his home in New York on Friday, April 19, 2002. Lee was born in Brooklyn in 1930. He attended the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn at night & graduated in 1959 with a BME in mechanical engineering. He also completed the Advanced Management Program at Stanford University. He was employed by Litton Industries in New Rochelle, NY from 1957 to 1966, and later joined Industrial Systems Division of Technicon, Inc. in Tarrytown, NY, where he was president from 1966-1983. Lee then relocated to Durham, NH in 1983, and served as president of Eastern Air Devices (now known as EADmotors) in Dover, NH until his retirement in 1998. Lee also served on the board of directors of EADmotors, HH Smith, Inc., and Howard Industries, Inc. Lee's vision and leadership was instrumental in doubling the sales volume of EADmotors during his tenure, and his coworkers and colleagues will never forget the man who reminded them to ''light a candle, rather than curse the darkness''. Lee's light touched so many of his colleagues in so many ways -he was passionate about learning; many employees earned their college degrees while under his tutelage. He believed that continued education was a benefit that everyone should enjoy, and he implemented a college tuition reimbursement plan for all EAD employees. He believed in helping others, and orchestrated EAD's long-standing support of the Seacoast United Way. Lee leaves behind his wife of 49 years, Norma of New York City and Durham, NH; three daughters, Ruth Rosenthal of New York City, Laura Pinna of Milan, Italy, and Madeleine Perlman of New York City; and two grandsons, Simon Lee and Skyler Pinna. Funeral services were held at the Riverside Memorial Chapel in New York City on April 23rd. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that memorial contributions be made to the American Heart Association.
