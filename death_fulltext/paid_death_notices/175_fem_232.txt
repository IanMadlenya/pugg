        WOLFE - Marguerite. Beloved wife of Stanley and cherished mother of Jeffrey and Madeleine, passed away peacefully on August 27, 2001. A Juilliard and Teachers College graduate, she was an accomplished pianist and long time teacher of music to children and young adults. She was a convert to Judaism and her lifelong love of reading led her to build a library at her synagogue. She will be forever loved and greatly missed. With all our hearts - Her family.
