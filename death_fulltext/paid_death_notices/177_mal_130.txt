        CHAISSON-Charles G. On October 7, 2001. Beloved brother and uncle will be deeply missed. Charles' profound love of God's creatures, colorful sense of humor and conversation endeared him to so many. A man of deep integrity and work ethic. For those who wish, a donation to the Humane Society in his name would be greatly appreciated by his family. Till we meet again, Dear Brother.
