        MERSON-Carl. November 8, 1999, three weeks before his 89th birthday. He lived a long and full life. Until his retirement, he had been a proprietor of B.A.M. Liquors in Mt. Vernon, a former liquor salesman, and a member of the Liquor Sales Union. In addition to his intellect and sincerity, he loved life and considered himself the luckiest man alive. He knew how to enjoy people, family, golf and a good piece of rye bread. He would marvel at his family and his legacies, for which he took no credit but was a major influence. He is survived by his two daughters and sons-in-law, Miriam and Larry Shapiro, Ann and Ardie Bialek; seven grandchildren and spouses, Debbie and Alan Plumer, Laura and Jacky Mizrahi, Andrew Shapiro, Michele and Todd Neufeld, David and Amy Bialek, Leah and Rachel Merson; five great-grandchildren, Trevor, Adam and Ross Plumer, Jessica Mizrahi, and Bradley Neufeld. He was predeceased by his cherished wife of sixty years, Billie, and their son, Robert. Everyone loved him. The pain of his departure is tempered by our memories of him and the knowledge that he is now at peace with his beloved wife and son.
