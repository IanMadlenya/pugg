        JIRANEK--David. It is with much sadness that we announce the death of David Jiranek, 45, who passed away Sunday, August 17. He was a Broadway producer, a writer, a photographer, a philanthropist and a family man. His passing will be deeply felt in the New York theater and in Old Greenwich, CT, where he and his family made their home. He leaves behind his beloved wife, Cricket Hooper Jiranek and their two daughters, Cat and Sailor, and an extended family that includes his mother Jen Jiranek and four half brothers: Theodore ''Teke'' Hoffman, R. Todd Hoffman, Robert H. Jiranek and James H. Jiranek.
        JIRANEK--David. Avid theater producer, passionate and visionary humanitarian, loyal and generous friend. With a phenomenal spirit, keen intellect, irresistible charm, and wry, ironic humor, he embraced life enthusiastically and made it more fun for those of us lucky enough to know him. His death out of time leaves a void in the lives of his producing partners, colleagues and friends as we contemplate a world without his unique personality. We are filled with sadness for Cricket, Cat and Sailor. We extend our deepest condolences to the entire Jiranek and Hooper families. Anne Squadron & Eric Krebs
