        STERN--Harry. We extend our sincerest condolences to Deborah Stern on the passing of her beloved husband and to Sheva Mann Adler, Rebecca Herschkopf, Sareva Naor, Zelda Rosenzweig, Chayim Stern and Jerome Stern on the loss of their cherished father. His strength of character, personal devotion to friends and business associates alike, and a readiness to accept any challenge that would perpetuate the well-being of the Jewish people and the State of Israel, made him an exceptional role model. As a Diamond Founder who sponsored the Harry and Martha Stern Diagnostic Center, together with his late wife, his outstretched hand of kindness made an invaluable contribution to the people of Israel. May the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. American Committee for Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem
