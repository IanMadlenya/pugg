        KANEKO--Mamoru, M.D. It is with profound sorrow that the Mount Sinai Alumni mourns the passing of our dear friend and colleague, one of Mount Sinai's greatest resources for over 40 years. He produced an enviable record of seminal and classic tomes which have become required reading by patholgists and clinicians. The cluster of eager residents around his demonstration table was a scene that has been commemorative of the best teachers in medicine for hundreds of years. In 1992, the Mount Sinai Alumni presented its most coveted award, the Jacobi Medallion, to Dr. Kaneko in acknowledgement of his profound professional achievements and his extraordinary service to the medical center and its alumni. Our heartfelt condolences are extended to his entire family. Barry Stimmel, MD, Pres. Elliot Rayfield, MD, V.P. Martin Goldstein, MD, Treas. Steven Itzkowitz, MD, Secy.
