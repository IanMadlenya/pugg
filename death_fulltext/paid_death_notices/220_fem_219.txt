        BENEZRA--Naomi Irene. A true woman of valor and grace, respected mentor and educator of thousands of Jewish children as Executive Director for 35 years at the Yeshivah of Crown Heights, left us on May 21st. A pillar of strength and beloved wife of Meyer. Loving mother of Frada, late son Teddy, Ruth, Vivien and Karen and mother-in-law of Larry, Rena, Roni, Harry, Paige and Hannah. Devoted sister of Paul and Debra, Mort and the late Fran and Berenice. Cherished grandmother of Irv and Kim, Adley, Heidi and Steve, Joshand Darcie, Ilana, Yoseph and Leor, proud great-grandmother of Ariana Star and Jack, Samantha & Rebecca. A scholarship fund has been established in her memory at the Yeshivah. Her enduring impact on all her ''bubalas'' will never be forgotten.
