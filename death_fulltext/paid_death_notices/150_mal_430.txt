        FARKAS-Alexander S. We will deeply miss our beloved friend, Alexander ''Sandy'' Farkas. We were privileged to witness his growth from the young president of Alexander's, to a leader of New York City, throughout his life, his compassion, humor and love. He brought as the joy of a son during our lifelong friendship. We extend our deepest sympathies to Linda, to his children, Georgette, Alexander and Cindy, to his brothers, Robin, Bruce and Jonathan and to Francine. Judge & Mrs. Francis X. Morrissey Boston, MA
