        NODELL-Paul H. (''Doc''), Ed.d., Educator. Beloved husband, father of many sons and daughter, grandfather, lived a life worth living. Survived by wife Celeste, daughter Diane (Mitch), granddaughter Sarah, son Dick. We will deeply miss the love and guidance of this genuine and generous man. Whoever knew him learned from him; whoever was touched by him came away enriched.
