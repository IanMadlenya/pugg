        ALCALAY--Naumi, CSW. The Yeshiva University family and its Sephardic Council of Overseers mourn the passing of a great Sephardic woman, who was a longtime friend and supporter. Humble and self-effacing, she revered her illustrious parents, Jelena (Rachel) and Chief Rabbi Dr. Isaac Abraham Alcalay of Yugoslavia, a former Senator in Yugoslavia, Chief Rabbi of the Central Sephardic Community of America, and teacher of The Haham, Rabbi Dr. Solomon Gaon, co-founder of YU's Sephardic Programs, and she envisioned at Yeshiva University the establishment of scholarships and expanded academic studies in Judeo Spanish Sephardic Studies in their names. Funeral services will take place on Friday, at 9:45 am, at Riverside Memorial Chapel in Manhattan. May her friends and the entire Alcalay family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Min Hashamayim tenuhamu. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel, President Norman Lamm, Chancellor Morry J. Weiss, Chairman Board of Trustees David Eshaghian, Chairman Sephardic Council of Overseers
