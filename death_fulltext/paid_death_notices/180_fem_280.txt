        MORATH-Inge. The adventure of Magnum for all of us, photographers, staff, and friends is immeasurably less sparkling today. For fifty years Inge Morath has enlivened our company with her bravery, charm, wit and wisdom. For a generation of us the magic of Paris started at Inge's Place at 8 Rue de la Chaise. She was a person of ineffable elegance-personal, intellectual and artistic. Hopefully it was contagious. There are no pieties that can possibly describe our sadness. When we meet in Paris next June there will be more than a chair that is empty. We all loved Inge and we are all richer for it.
