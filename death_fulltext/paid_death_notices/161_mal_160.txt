        WINKLER-Franz. The Officers and Trustees of the Leo Baeck Institute are deeply saddened by the loss of our dear friend Franz, for many years the Intitute's Vice President and Honorary Vice President. His devotion to our work and his support of the Institute's mission of preserving the rich heritage of German-speaking Jewry never diminished. His appreciation of the LBI's research library and archives reflected his love of learning and respect for scholarship. He upheld our highest traditional values without ever discouraging our new initiatives. Franz Winkler was a wonderful, thoughtful, and highly regarded Officer of the Leo Baeck Institute. Most of all, he was a genuine friend. Our heartfelt condolances to his dear wife Marianne, to his children and his grandchildren. Ismar Schorsch, President, LBI Carol Kahn Strauss, Exec. Dir.
