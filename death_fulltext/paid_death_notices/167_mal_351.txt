        GASSNER-Rudi. The board of directors and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Rudi Gassner, a cherished friend and supporter of our mission. A philanthropic leader and activist, he served with devotion on the executive committee of our Entertainment Division's Music Group. During his distinguished career, he inspired many of his colleagues at BMG Entertainment to emulate his example of caring and commitment. Through his unstinting generosity to UJA-Federation, he helped to build our community and enhance Jewish life in New York, in Israel, and throughout the world. He will be greatly missed by the leadership of UJAFederation; by the chairman of his company, Thomas Middelhoff; and by all his professional colleagues. To his family and friends we extend our deepest sympathies. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion. James S. Tisch, President Larry Zicklin, Chair, Board of Directors John S. Ruskay, Executive Vice President & CEO
