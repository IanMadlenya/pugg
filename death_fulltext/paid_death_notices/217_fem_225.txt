        ROSENBLATT--Louise, on February 8, age 100. The Steinhardt School of Education mourns the loss of Professor Emerita Louise Rosenblatt. Celebrated scholar, gifted researcher, and revered teacher, Louise's groundbreaking book, ''Literature as Exploration'' (1938), made her a pioneer in reading theory and the teaching of literature. A faculty member for 24 years, Louise was a former director of the doctoral program in English Education. She brought passion, intensity, and wisdom into the classroom, mentored hundreds of students, and was a dear friend to many. Her theories have influenced generations of teachers and teacher educators and the children they teach. We extend our deepest condolences to her son, Jonathan, and her granddaughter, Anna.
