        LYON--Alice, age 68, on June 6, 2003, of Sag Harbor, NY. Beloved wife of Larry Perrine. Loving mother of Cecil and Maya Auchincloss and sister of Dr. Lilla Lyon. Alice was the granddaughter and daughter of diplomats and lived the world over. She spoke five languages, painted, entertained with flair and loved her friends and family with a depth and loyalty unmatched. She worked for the C.I.A., acted in movies, sold real estate and served her community. All who met her knew she was the loveliest, gentlest, kindest soul they had known. A memorial service will be held for Alice on Tuesday, June 17 at 12 noon at Christ Episcopal Church in Sag Harbor, NY, followed by a reception at Channing Daughters Winery in Bridgehampton, NY. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to: East End Hospice, P.O. Box 1048, Westhampton Beach, New York 11978-7048. >>AD#
