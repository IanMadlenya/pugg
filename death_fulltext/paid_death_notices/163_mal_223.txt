        RUBEN-William. All of us at Carnival Corporation mourn the death of our very dear friend, colleague and trusted advisor, Bill Ruben. Bill joined Carnival Corporation's Board of Directors when the Company went public in July 1987. He has provided the Company with years of valuable service, sound business counsel, and unwavering friendship. We will miss him greatly and extend our sincere condolences to the Ruben family.
