        FREUND-Gerald. The Hunter College community mourns the loss of Gerald Freund, our first Dean of Humanities and the Arts (1971-1979). He shaped the course of study for liberal arts students, served as a mentor to students and faculty, initiated the Hunter Galleries, and obtained vital funding for innovative programs in the liberal and performing arts. We extend our condolences to his family. David A. Caputo, President, Hunter College
