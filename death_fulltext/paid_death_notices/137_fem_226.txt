        ALLEN-Joanne E. On June 24, 1998, following a stroke, passed away in Miami Beach, FL, age 68. Joanne, wife of Skip Allen, was born in New London, CT. on July 18, 1929. She graduated from high school in Mamaroneck, N.Y., and Georgetown Visitation College in Washington, D.C. In 1967, Joanne and Skip, with their six children, moved from Larchmont, NY to Miami Beach. Always active in yachting, Joanne hosted parties at their home for the Storm Trysail Club, the SORC, and held ''The Party'' annually for 500 or more friends during the Miami Boat Show. In addition, Joanne and Skip led guided cruises over to the Bahamas in the 1970s and '80s and were active supporters of Antiqua Sailing Week. Her favorite times were cruising the Exuma Cays in the Bahamas with her family and friends. Joanne and Skip spent each spring and summer in the Islands, making literally hundreds of friends throughout the chain as they cruised in their trawler, ''Press On Regardless.'' In 1972, they started Southern Boating Magazine together, a publication which has attracted a loyal and growing readership and continues to flourish after 25 years. The welcome mat was always out at the Allen's home. A warm, generous and big-hearted lady, her home was always open to all their friends which earned her the universal title, ''Mom.'' Joanne is survived and will be deeply missed by her husband, Skip, and their six children, Rick, Skip Jr., Cathryn, Jody and her husband Steve, George and Paige; their six grandchildren, Charlotte, Alexandra, Corey, Michael, Ashley and Christina; and by an incredible number of friends whom she touched during her long and full life. A memorial service will be held in Fort Lauderdale, FL., at Church by the Sea, 2700 Mayan Drive, Ft. Lauderdale, FL 33316 (just east of the 17th Street bridge), on Saturday, June 27 at 10:30 AM. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be sent to Church by the Sea.
