        LASLEY--Allison. Her light shined too briefly--but oh so brightly. We shall miss her courage, her elegance, her artistry and style. Mostly we shall miss her friendship. Our heartfelt condolences to her beloved Stuart, John, Kimberly, Heather, and of course, Bear. Love forever, Susan and Phil
