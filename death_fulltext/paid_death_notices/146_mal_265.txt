        MEIBACH-Aaron. On March 11, 1999. Beloved husband of Freda (recently deceased). Loving father of Ina Lea Meibach, Doris Wallace (Martin) and Judy Meibach.

In retirement, he relished his work as a volunteer for the Hebrew Home for the Aged in Riverdale. A man of principle, he lived his Judaism in prayer and good deeds.
