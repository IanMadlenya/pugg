        ORR--George, Ph.D. Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University is deeply saddened by the loss too soon of its Professor of Molecular Pharmacology and director of its Biodefense Proteomics Research Center. A native of Great Britain, Dr. Orr was a devoted member of the Einstein faculty for more than a quarter-century and an expert in proteomics, the study of the structure and function of proteins. He was an outstanding scientist, teacher, colleague, friend and superb collaborator and will be remembered as a passionate scientist and compassionate human being. He will be greatly missed and we extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Mary, his children, Daniel, Andrew and Jane, and the entire family. Dominick P. Purpura, M.D. The Marilyn and Stanley M. Katz Dean Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University
