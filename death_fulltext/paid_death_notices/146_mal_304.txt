        LEWIS-Sydney. The death of Syndey Lewis is a great loss to the contemporary art, architecture, and design communities. Sydney and his beloved wife Frances assembled one of the greatest private collections of late 19th and 20th century decorative art, which they gave to the Virginia Museum of Art, where it is on view along with their collection of post-1945 painting and sculpture. A devoted friend of contemporary artists, Sydney ignored his illness to celebrate with us at the opening of the Museum's retrospective of his dear friend Chuck Close. He will be missed by his many friends at the Museum, and we extend our deepest condolences to his wife Frances and their children and grandchildren. Ronald S. Lauder, Chairman Agnes Gund, President Glenn D. Lowry, Director The Museum of Modern Art, NY
