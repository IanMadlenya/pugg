The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, who made her Met debut in 1964 in one of her most celebrated roles, the Marschallin in ''Der Rosenkavalier.'' She was one of the great sopranos of the twentieth century. We extend our condolences to her family and friends. Peter Gelb, General Manager James Levine, Music Director
