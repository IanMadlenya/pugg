        SMOLEN-Arthur. Guiding Eyes For The Blind and the Ken Venturi Guiding Eyes Golf Classic Committee mourn the passing of our friend and longtime supporter, Arthur Smolen. His efforts have significantly helped to enrich the lives of many blind individuals through the use of trained guide dogs. Our deepest sympathy to the Smolen family.
