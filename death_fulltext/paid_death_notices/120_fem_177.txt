        LIVINGSTON-Gladys Sherr Ritter. With great sadness we record the passing of our beloved Gladys Livingston, a woman of style, humor and generosity. Mother of Toby and Nataly Ritter, Frances and Robert Weisman. Grandmother of Louis and Laurie, Ward and Loree and Adam Weisman; Louis, Victoria and Meridith Ritter. Great grandmother of the most precious Erin Rose. Aunt of David and Marie Ritter, Alan and Eileen Silverstein Ritter, Daniel Sherr, Irene and Leigh Breslau, Miriam and Gedaliah Wollosh. Stepmother to Peter and Ellen Livingston, Patricia and Richard Perlman. As the matriarch of our family, she has been a role model and an inspiration to many. She brought a joy and unity to her family that will endure as a living memorial. Services will be held at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81 St., 10AM, Sunday, January 26, 1997. Donations in her memory may be sent to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.
