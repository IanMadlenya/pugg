        DWORKIN--William. October 29, 2003 in New York. He would have been 76 November 9th. He was long active in marketing books on art and architecture, notably at Harry N. Abrams, and then at Rizzoli where he was Vice President for Sales and Associate Editor. He gravitated to publishing out of his love of books. Born in Newark, NJ, he attended Rutgers, Colorado and the University of Chicago. He was an omnivorous reader with a passion for the beautiful and humanizing in the arts, especially classical music. An avid collector of recordings, he was as devoted to film history, having spent his youth in the flickering dark. Secular to his fingertips, he led for over 25 years a Yiddish reading group with wry humor and quiet authority. Dignified, modest, charming of deep feeling and integrity, he is mourned by many friends, his darling cousin Lillian Loewenthal, her husband Leo, and sons Danny and Eben, his nephew David Stamboulis and the family of Eugene Roth, his companion of 33 years who survives him sore at heart. A memorial will be held in December.
