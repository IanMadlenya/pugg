        RIGHTER--Volney Foster. It is with profound sorrow that the Board of Trustees, the Board of Overseers and the Staff of the Katonah Museum of Art mourn the passing of our beloved Trustee and Overseer. Turkey taught us to think out of the box, to think positively and to always be generous. He and his beloved wife, Sally, were an integral part of the growth of the Museum over the last 50 years. We will miss his frequent visits to the Museum, his insights on the Marketing Committee, and his wisdom at board meetings. We have truly lost a great friend.
