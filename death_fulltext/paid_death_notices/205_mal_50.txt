        LEVY--Marvin W. We mourn the death of our beloved partner, respected colleague and dear friend who died peacefully at home on February 1st, 2004. A distinguished member of the Bar for over fifty years, he practiced law with us for the past twenty. Prior to that, he served for many years as the Head of the Estate Tax Department in the New York County Surrogate's Court. His counsel was sought by many, and judges would appoint him to protect the interests of children and the elderly in the most difficult of cases. We extend our most heartfelt condolences to Annette, his beloved wife of fifty-seven years, and his family and friends. HECHT-LAW, LLC Allan S. Hecht, Helene L. Karas, Regina Capito, and Staff
