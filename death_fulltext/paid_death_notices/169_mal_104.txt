        FISCHER-Donald, Hazzan Dr. The Cantors Assembly records with sorrow the tragic passing of a revered colleague. A brilliant cantor, he quietly and gently served the spiritual needs of Congregation Netivot Shalom of Berkeley, Calif., for more than a decade. His kindness, his humanity and his caring inspired us all. We extend our sympathy to his wife, Jan, his children and his loved ones. May his memory abide as a blessing. Hazzan Chaim Najman, President Hazzan Stephen J. Stein, Exec. VP Hazzan Abraham B. Shapiro Exec. Administrator
