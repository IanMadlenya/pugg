        DE LA CRUZ-Peter. Passed away on November 23, 2001. He has joined his Mother, Dona Polita, on that eternal journey. Although his later years were filled with suffering, God blessed him with a special person, who shared love and friendship, as well as, comfort and support. Jo Brewer is such an individual. His sister would like to acknowledge a personal thank you to her for bringing many moments of joy into his life. He is survived by his sister, Elma M. Lopez & his children Melissa, Corey, Adriana, Casondra and Mario. May the Divine welcome him into that peaceful abode where all suffering has ceased.
