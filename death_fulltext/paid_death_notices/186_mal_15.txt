        GUIDI-Marcello. The Board and staff of The Howard Gilman Foundation mourn the death of Marcello Guidi, one of Howard Gilman's oldest friends, a former President of the Foundation and a beloved mentor and colleague. After his distinguished diplomatic career as Italian Ambassador to Ethiopia, Japan and Germany, and Deputy Secretary General of NATO, Ambassador Guidi joined the Gilman Paper Company as Howard Gilman's personal consultant and as a Director of the Foundation. His wise counsel over the years, critical to the development of the Foundation, and his friendship will be sorely missed. We extend our deepest sympathy to his beloved wife, Gioia.
