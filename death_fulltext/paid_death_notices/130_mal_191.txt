        ROSENBERG-Charles. Elected President Emeritus, after serving as President of the Institute for 15 years, he served with honor and distinction as Board Member and officer for more than 30 years. His leadership was all inclusive, as he led by example, the members of the Board and staff. He left a heritage of fellowship and compassion with all who served with him. His goals were to serve handicapped children and their families at the highest possible level. For this, his spirit will endure. May his family, Min, Jackie, Ronnie, Ellie and grandchildren be comforted in the memory of his many kindnesses and good deeds, both to the Agency and to many board and staff members who came to him for help and comfort.
