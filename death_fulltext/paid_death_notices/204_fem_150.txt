        HAGEN--Uta. The Board of Directors, faculty and staff of the HB Studio and the HB Playwrights Foundation Theatre deeply mourn the death of their cherished and noble co-founder and president, who died peacefully on January 15, 2004 after a long battle with complications following a stroke two years ago. She loved the theatre, loved acting and she loved teaching, and she was in turn loved by friends, audiences and students who were fortunate enough to see her perform or study with her. She will be greatly missed. A Memorial service is planned, details to be announced at a later date. In lieu of flowers, Uta requested that donations be made to her beloved HB Playwrights Theatre, 122 Bank St, NY, NY 10014.
