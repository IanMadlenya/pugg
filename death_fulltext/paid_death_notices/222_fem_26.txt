        KAY--Shana. 19, beloved daughter of Jane and Randy Kay, sister to Jared and granddaughter to Gladys Bernstein. She passed on July 3rd after a sudden and quick illness. Shana had a verve for life that was readily apparent to all who knew her. She loved being a student at University of Wisconsin, a counselor at Camp Kinder Ring and being with our close knit family. You are missed so terribly. Till we meet again. We love you very much. Mom and Dad
        KAY--Shana. My shining star, in my heart forever. Love and kisses. Nanala
