        LEUCHTER-Ben Zion. The Board of Directors and staff of JTA, the Global News Service of the Jewish People, mourn the death of Ben Zion Leuchter, our beloved Director and longtime chair of our Editorial Policy Committee. A journalist himself, Ben set the highest standards of excellence and professionalism for our news agency. We will remember his warmth, grace and kindness always. May his wife, Magda, their children and grandchildren be comforted among the mourners of Zion. Shoshana S. Cardin, President Mark J. Joffe, Publisher
