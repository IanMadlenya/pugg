        McKELVEY-Jean T. We are immensely saddened by the death of Jean T. McKelvey of Rochester, New York, a superb teacher, arbitrator of labor disputes and mediator. She was the first woman president of the National Academy of Arbitrators and that recognition opened the door for others. She was a remarkable teacher, recognized where ever she went for the quality and warmth of her work, for her earned reputation throughout the country. Being a ''McKelvey Student'' is a badge of honor. We are the poorer for her passing but her influence will live on for many years. Milton Rubin, President, National Academy of Arbitrators
