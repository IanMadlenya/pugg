        MacCABE--Margaret I. Windsor ''Molly'', age 93, of New Canaan and Rowayton, CT, died August 9, 2003, at Waveny Care Center, New Canaan, CT. ''Molly'' came to the U.S. from Croydon, England, in 1936 when her work on the coronation of Edward VI was curtailed by his abdication. At the outbreak of war, she joined the WREN's (U.K. Navy), working in Boston, Washington and New York. In 1946 she joined the original staff of the U.N. ''The Mohigans'', in the transportation department. At the U.N., she met her husband, Joseph W. MacCabe, who, after working in Palestine in 1947 and 1948, went on to a career as a UNDP staff member. She left the U.N. in 1951 to be mother to her only son, Alistair, and the family moved to Connecticut. Always engaged, in 1965 she launched a new career in real estate and promptly opened her own firm as one of the first successful women-owned businesses. After 25 years and many accomplishments, she sold the business. Widowed in 1992, her final years were spent pursuing her lifelong passion for photography, photos taken all over the world, and winning numerous amateur awards. At age 89, she had her own one-person show. Over the years her generous support of community and charitable activities from gardening to the symphony evidenced her belief that to be global citizens we must be manifest in our local community life. She is survived by her son, Alistair W.W. MacCabe of San Diego, CA, and her sister, Daphne Chotteau of Brussels, Belgium. A Memorial Service will be held at St. Luke's Episcopal Church, Darien, CT, on September 27, 2003, at 11 AM. In lieu of flowers, donations are welcomed to Darien Book Aid Plan, Inc., 1926 Post Road, Darien, CT 06820, or UNICEF, 3 U.N. Plaza, New York, NY 10017.
