        KANZER-Mark, MD. A noted psychoanalyst, author and educator, died April 14th at the King Street Nursing Home in Rye Brook, NY of congestive heart failure at the age of 89. In 1994, shortly after Dr. Kanzer's retirement, the Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association published a tribute to him (Volume 42, Issue 3, page 695), noting ''His scholarship was awesome, and his prolific contributions enriched the psychoanalytic literature...'' Dr. Kanzer was a founder of the Division of Psychoanalytic Education at Downstate Medical Center, now the Psychoanalytic Institute at New York University, and served as Director of the Institute. Dr. Kanzer was the co-editor with Jules Glenn, MD of Volumes 1 and 2 of ''Freud and His Self-Analysis'' (1979). His many published articles include ''Freud and the Demon'', ''Freud and His Literary Doubles'', ''The Passing of the Oedipus Complex'' in Greek drama, ''The Oedipus Trilogy'', ''On Interpreting the Oedipus Plays'', and ''Oedipus: History, Legends, Plays, Complexes.'' Dr. Arnold D. Richards, Editor, Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association, said ''Dr. Kanzer should be remembered for his extraordinary psychoanalytic philanthropy as well as his scholarship.'' Dr. Kanzer established the Mark and Viva Kanzer Fund in the 1970's under the editorship of Harold Blum and funded an annual journal prize and made possible many other important journal publishing projects. Dr. Kanzer is survived by his son, Alan, a New York attorney.
