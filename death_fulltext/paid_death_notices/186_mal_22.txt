        SCHWARZ-Joseph. An extraordinarily devoted and loyal Trustee of the Optometric Center of New York, Joe Schwarz symbolized friendship and dedication to the scientific and professional mission of the SUNY College of Optometry from its inception. His remarkable insites and keen appreciation of future undertakings wisely helped to guide his fellow Trustees. He was deeply interested in the needs of students throughout his long tenure. He was a giant in the optical industry. His camaraderie and sincere fellowship will be missed. His abiding generosity and philanthropy will forever be remembered in the Joseph and Roberta Schwarz Theatre at the SUNY College of Optometry. But most of all, we will miss a very dear and gracious friend. Claudia C. Rouhana, Kim Eierman Co-Presidents, Optometric Center of New York Dr. Alden N.
