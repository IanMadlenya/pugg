        ODINOV-Mae. Irreplacable mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, friend and colleague, resigned her position in the world ''unequivocally'' as she put it, on June 26, 1999. She was too busy managing an office, attending the opera, movies and museums, to realize her time was running out. She always had time for people from all backgrounds, races and religions, and time to share all the fun she found in life. Twice widowed, she knew deep sorrow, but she also knew good talk, good times and joy. Her laughter filled the room and the hearts of all who heard it. She was smart and funny, a great talker and a great listener. Her life is one to celebrate. Mae asked that those wishing to remember her forego flowers and instead donate in her honor to the Houston Hospice or to the hospice of their choice. Friends are invited to a celebration of Mae's life on Monday, June 28 between 4-6 PM at the Jewish Community Center, 5601 S. Braeswood, Houston, TX.
