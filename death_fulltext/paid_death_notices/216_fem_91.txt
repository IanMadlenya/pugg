        SPIELMANN--Walli. On January 6, 2005, Walli Spielmann, 88, beloved mother succumbed to complications of congestive heart failure and Alzheimer's disease. A survivor of Auschwitz, a fighter to the end with the same indomitable spirit that helped her survive the Holocaust, she will be sorely missed and never forgotten. We love you, mom, for all our days. Diane and Lee
