        STERN-Isaac. Yale University and the School of Music mourn the loss of Isaac Stern, one of the most beloved violinists of his generation, a champion of music as a profoundly unifying force, and a mentor of enormous influence. He was a cherished friend who unselfishly shared his unique gifts with our community. We were honored to bestow the degree of Doctor of Music upon him. To his children and to his entire family we extend our heartfelt sympathy and our eternal gratitude for sharing his energy and talents with us. Richard C. Levin, President of Yale University Robert L. Blocker, The Lucy and Henry Moses Dean of Music
