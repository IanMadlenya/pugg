        FORTNER--Joseph G. The staff of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) note with sadness the death of our esteemed colleague, Joseph G. Fortner. Dr. Fortner served at MSKCC for nearly 45 years (from 1951 to 1995) and was Chief of the Gastric and Mixed Tumor Service from 1970 to 1978. He was an authority on the surgical treatment of liver and pancreatic cancers and pioneered techniques for liver transplantation and therapies for metastatic melanoma. A devoted teacher and mentor, Dr. Fortner was a founder and the first president of the General Motors Cancer Research Foundation, which was established in 1978 to honor cancer researchers and inspire young scientists to pursue cancer studies. We extend our condolences to his wife and family. Peter T. Scardino Chair, Dept. of Surgery Robert E.
