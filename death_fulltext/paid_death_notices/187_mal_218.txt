        CARNAHAN-A. Vernon. The Board of Governors and Members of The Circumnavigators Club records with profound sorrow the passing of our esteemed Past International President, A. Vernon Carnahan. Through the past decades, this beloved and treasured member has served our century-old organization as a longtime Member of our Board of Governors, as Chairman of various advisory committees, as President of our Foundation, and as International President from 1987 through 1988. Vern promoted the highest standards of our Club and epitomized our creed, ''through friendship to leave this world a little better than we found it.'' We extend our deepest sympathy to his beloved wife and Circumnavigator, Betty, and to his entire family. Jeffrey Kelly Alfred Morasso, Jr International Presidents
