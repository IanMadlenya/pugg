        KUEHL-Professor John. The Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science and the Faculty of the English Department of New York University announce with sorrow the death of our colleague and friend, John Kuehl. A noted scholar of F. Scott Fitzgerald and contemporary writing, Professor Kuehl was also a novelist and short story writer. His wit, engaging manner and brilliant teaching earned the admiration of his students and friends. In his memory, the English Department will establish the John Kuehl Prize for Research on F. Scott Fitzgerald by an NYU Graduate student. We extend our warmest condolences to his widow, Professor Linda Kuehl.
