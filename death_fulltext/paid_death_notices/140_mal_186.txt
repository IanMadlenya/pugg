        WOLF-Robert. The Trustees and Staff of the Educational Alliance note with profound sadness the passing of Robert Wolf, our past president, honorary trustee and friend. Bob joined the Alliance's Board of Trustees in 1948 and served as President of the Alliance from 1958-1961. During this period he helped to define the modern role of the Alliance as a social group work agency serving all groups in the community with an unusually diverse range of programs and services. He continued to support our activities even after he left our Board to assume a leadership role in the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife Peggy, children and grandchildren.
