        ROSS--Jeffrey A. The staff of the Anti-Defamation League mourns the untimely passing of our colleague and friend, Jeffrey A. Ross, ADL, Director of Campus Affairs/Higher Education Affairs. For nearly 20 years, Jeff committed himself to combating anti-Semitism and bigotry on our nation's campuses by working to foster intergroup understanding, by engaging students, faculty and administrators in multi-faceted programming. He touched many lives and will be sorely missed. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Marjorie, his children and the entire family. Abraham H. Foxman, National Director >>AD#
