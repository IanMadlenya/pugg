        BIDDLE--Sydney Francis. Of New York, and New Preston, CT, died on December 4, 2004, at the age of 86. Born in Philadelphia, Sydney attended Harvard College before serving in the United States Navy from 1941 to 1945, when he was discharged as a Lieutenant Commander. Sydney went on to graduate from the University of California, Berkley, and received a law degree from Columbia University. After a career in law and insurance, he retired in 1985. Late in life, Sydney returned to an earlier passion--painting--and experienced great success and satisfaction creating wonderful paintings, drawings and prints in his studios in New Mexico, New York and Connecticut. Sydney will be profoundly missed by his many friends and devoted family. He is survived by his beloved wife Flora, his daughter Alexandra (Bimmy) and son-in-law John Basinski of Jenkintown, PA, brothers Stark and Oliver, stepchildren Michelle Evans, Duncan Irving, Cully Irving, Fiona Donovan and their spouses, nine step-grandchildren and two step-greatgrandchildren. In lieu of flowers, contributions in Sydney's memory may be made to The Fabric Workshop and Museum (Acadia Summer Art Program), 1315 Cherry St, Philadelphia, PA 19107, (215) 568-1111 x22. Sydney's paintings, wrote his friend and fellow artist George Woodman, ''refresh as do cool breezes coming from a different quarter. We should be grateful for them.'' Just as we are all eternally grateful to have known this intellectual, evercurious, gracious and gregarious man.
