        BURCHENAL--Joseph. The staff of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center mourn the death of Joseph Burchenal. Dr. Burchenal served at MSKCC for more than 35 years, including as Director of Clinical Investigation. Recognized and honored internationally with awards including The Lasker Award and The Alfred P. Sloan Award in Cancer Research, he was a pioneer in the field of chemotherapy. Beginning in the 1940's he designed laboratory models and initiated clinical trials to assess the benefits of chemotherapy, particularly for childhood leukemia and lymphoma. He played a large role in developing chemotherapy into the important method of treatment it remains today. Cancer patients everywhere are indebted to this farsighted, energetic man. We extend our condolences to his wife and family. Robert E. Wittes Physician-in-Chief George J. Bosl, Chairman Dept. of Medicine Richard J.
