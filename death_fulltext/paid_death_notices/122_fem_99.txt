        HAUSMAN-Blanche. The Yeshiva University family mourns the passing of a dear friend who, with her beloved husband, Leo, and brothers-in-law Jack and the late Samuel and their families, was a YU Guardian and Founder of our Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Through the Hausman Belding Foundation, she was a Fellow of YU's Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. We extend our heartfelt condolences to children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University David S. Gottesman, Chairman Board of Trustees
