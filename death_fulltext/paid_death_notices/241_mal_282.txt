        BLUM--Robert. February 12th, 1919 -Febraury 17th, 2007. Beloved husband to Evelyn for 58 years. Devoted son of Mary and Morris Blum. Cherished brother of Ruth Spivak (Ralph). Adoring Father of Alan (Raynee) and Stanley (Janie). Proud Zayda of Michael (Amanda), Benjamin (Melissa) Robyn, and Margot. Robert was an accomplished Businessman Founder and Chairman Emeritus of Blum & Fink, Inc. and its affiliates. Bob was a man of humble origins, truly a self-made man. His ''Raison D'etre'' was his beloved Evie, his children and his family. We will miss his physical presence but know he will always be with us. These words express our shared feelings: Do not stand at my grave and weep. I am not there, I do not sleep. I am the sparkle in the snow. I am the shredded leaves that blow. I am the sunlight on growing grain. I am the gentle summer rain. I am the quiet bird at night. Circling about; taking flight. So do not stand at my grave and weep. I am not there I do not sleep. Rest in peace our beloved Bob.
