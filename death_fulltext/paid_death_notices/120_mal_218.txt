        BEN-ZION-(Weisberger) Rabbi Ralph Moses. We record with sorrow the passing of our beloved colleague in Israel. Ordained in 1940, he served pulpits in Philadelphia and North Carolina before making aliyah in 1969. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his brothers Israel and Cantor Irving and sister Estelle Klein and to all who were touched through his rabbinate. Rabbi David L. Lieber, Pres. Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Exec. V.P. The Rabbinical Assembly
