        HORNICK-Lita. The Museum of Modern Art and its Contemporary Arts Council pay tribute to the life of Lita Hornick, who for over 25 years fostered the collaboration of artists and writers through Kulchur Magazine and the sponosorship of poetry readings at the Museum. Her unique spirit, friendship, and generosity as a donor to the collection will be long remembered. We extend our profound sympathy to her children Louis and Blake and other members of the family.
