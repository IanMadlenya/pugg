        GLENN-Norman R. The officers and directors of City Innovation mourn the passing of Norman R. Glenn, Founder and Chairman/ CEO of The Community Action Network, our affiliate since 1995. His energy, persistence and indomitable spirit created and sustained a unique information system focused on the many ways volunteer activities help solve important local community problems. His legacy is a living library of tested ideas that improve life for millions of Americans. We extend our condolences to Roberta and all others in Norman's family. We all will miss his dedication to purposive volunteer work. City Innovation Otto A. Silha Chairman and Founder Alfred Eisenpreis Vice Chairman
