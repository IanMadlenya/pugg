        ENGLAND - Marshall. Marshall England was a soldier in the Civil Rights Movement who never forgot the struggle. He fought for more than 40 years for the rights of New Yorkers to decent health care and other services, and inspired others to take up the cause of social and economic justice. His personal sacrifices for that cause leave all of us indebted. Susan Breslin Rudolph E. Bryant Luther W. Seabrook Ronald Shiffman
