        BENEDEK--Armand. On February 9, 2004, Armand Benedek of Pound Ridge, N.Y., was declared missing and presumed dead after a tragic scuba diving accident while vacationing on Grand Cayman Island, BWI. Born on February 15, 1931, in the Bronx, N.Y., Armand graduated from the high school of Arts & Sciences. He attended Cornell University and received a degree in Landscape Architecture from the University of Georgia School of Environmental Design. After college, he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force Reserves and retired at the rank of Lt. Colonel. He married Phyllis Roby in 1957 and they have lived in Pound Ridge for over 35 years. In 1961, Armand founded his own practice, currently the firm of Armand Benedek and Glenn Ticehurst, Ltd. where he was still working full time. He was a Fellow Member in the American Society of Landscape Architects. In addition to his wife, Armand leaves behind a brother, Richard (Elissa) of Ann Arbor, MI, and several nieces and nephews. He has two daughters, Lia Kaufman (Frank) of Carmel, N.Y. and Amanda Soulias (Charles) of South Salem, N.Y. and two stepdaughters, Carol Bates and Martha Briante, both of Stamford, CT. Seven grandchildren and five greatgrandchildren will miss their ''Pom Pom'' dearly. As per Armand's wishes, there will be no service. Because he loved Grand Cayman so much and had been visiting there for over 40 years, charitable donations can be made in his memory to the National Trust for Cayman Islands, P.O. Box 31116SMB, Grand Caymen Islands, BWI. (www.nationaltrust.org.ky) or to the Riverkeeper at P.O. Box 130, Garrison, N.Y. 10524 (www.riverkeeper.com)
