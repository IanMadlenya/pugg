        LANDYNSKI--Jacob. On July 29, 2003. The Trustees, faculty, and staff of New School University mourn the loss of Jacob Landynski, Professor and former Chair of Political Science at the Graduate Faculty of Political and Social Science for over 40 years. His scholarly work, cited in over a dozen Supreme Court opinions, focused on the intersection between governmental power and individual rights. His commitment to teaching was unparalleled. Our condolences to his wife, Miriam; four daughters, Suri, Sagie, Tevorah, and Malka; three sons, Moshe, Pinchas, and Azrohom; and many grandchildren. Philip Scaturro, Chairman, Board of Trustees Bob Kerrey, President, New School University Richard J. Bernstein, Dean, Graduate Faculty
