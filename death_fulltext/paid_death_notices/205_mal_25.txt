        MAYER--Egon. The Jewish Outreach Institute notes with profound sorrow the passing of its beloved founding director, a pioneer in the field of outreach. His sensitive concern for the well-being of others provided a welcoming atmosphere for all those intermarried in the Jewish community. While it is a time of great sorrow, it is also a time for all of us involved with JOI to renew our commitment to the goals of our organization; goals which formed the very center of Egon's love, work, and dedication to the Jewish people and humankind. Our sympathy is extended to his wife, Marcia; his daughters, Daphne, Reina and Danielle; and his mother Heddy. Terrence A. Elkes, President Eugene M. Grant, Chairman Rabbi Kerry M. Olitzky Executive Director
