        REGNA-Peter P. The entire Polytechnic University family mourns the passing of Peter P. Regna, alumnus, distinguished scientist and generous benefactor. Dr. Regna's career spanned half a century. He played a pivotal role in discovering, developing and manufacturing drugs that revolutionized medical practice. At Pfizer Inc., he was part of a team that, in 1950, discovered Terramycin; he also played a key role in the production of penicillin, streptomycin and other antibiotics. At Squibb Institute for Medical Research, he was among the first to explore the new field of genetic engineering. Dr. Regna held more that 35 patents and received many honors, including the Perkin Medal from the American Section of the Society of Chemical Industry. At the time of his passing, he was cofounder and managing partner of Harrington Research Co. Dr. Regna earned his bachelor's, master's and doctorate degrees at Polytechnic University, where he endowed a student center and a cutting-edge laboratory in biotechnology, and was awarded an honorary doctorate of science in 1994. We extend our condolences and profound sympathy to his wife, Barbara; two sons, Richard and Peter J; and all the other family members upon their loss.
