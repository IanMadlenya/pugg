        GUADAGNO-Maestro Anton, died on August 16, 2002, in Vienna, Austria, having conducted a performance of ''Otello'' at the opera festival in St. Margarethen, Austria the prior day. Maestro was artistic director and principal conductor of the Palm Beach Opera for over eighteen years. He was a principal conductor of the Vienna State Opera for thirty seasons and also conducted extensively at the Metropolitan Opera, the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden, the Paris Opera and in Tokyo. The Board of Directors, the management, staff, patrons and devoted audience of Palm Beach Opera express their deepest sympathy to his wife, Dolores, and his son, Steven, at the loss of not just a veritable giant in the international opera world but, even more, a warm, devoted and intensively caring husband, father and friend. His musical legacy is secure with Palm Beach Opera and is already the inspiration that will be the guiding principle in forging ahead in memory of its beloved Maestro. His constant example of excellence will be the benchmark for the continuity of Palm Beach Opera. Funeral services will be in New York at a time yet to be determined.
        GUADAGNO-Anton. Dearly beloved Maestro and Artistic Director of Palm Beach Opera was a charismatic man of remarkable talent, magnetic dynamism, total dedication and monumental energy expended in the pursuit of excellence in his art. We mourn his loss together with Dolores and Steven and the entire world of opera. Muriel and Arnold Shapiro
