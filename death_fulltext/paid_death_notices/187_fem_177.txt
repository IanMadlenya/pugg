        COHEN - Frances. Dear mother, until your unfortunate illness a few years ago, you were an accomplished pianist and an outstanding athlete, as well as being a sensitive, warm, loving, understanding woman who never had a bad word to say about anyone. You were my golf and bridge partner, as well as my best friend, and the person most helpful to me in the troubled times of my life. I love you very much and will always miss and think about you. Marilyn
