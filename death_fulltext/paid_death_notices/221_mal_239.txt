        GATTENGO--Sam. June 17, 2005, two weeks shy of age 85. Irascible and charming, known as ''Kid Enthusiasm'' when he began his stellar career with the Fuller Brush Co. in 1939. Infuriating, obtuse, brilliant, astute. Always in a hurry; a great dancer; lifelong Torah scholar; devoted son and brother to Daisy (deceased), eccentric and loving uncle to niece Nina Garfinkel and nephew Mark D. Garfinkel, Ph.D. He will be missed by his family, congregation, and loyal customers more than he ever could have imagined. Famously frugal, he would blow a gasket over the cost of this notice. Donations in his memory may be made to The Sephardic Temple, 775 Branch Blvd, Cedarhurst, New York 11516.
