        BLUMBERG-Albert E. The Audubon Reform Democratic Club mourns the passing of our longtime President. A political leader, senior citizens advocate, philosophy professor and an activist in the truest sense, he worked hard to organize people in northern Manhattan to improve their communities and especially to empower the Dominican community. He has left an indelible mark and will be greatly missed by all who worked with him.
