        SUMNER-Janet. The Amateur Comedy Club records with sorrow the passing on October 31st of its esteemed Honorary Associate Member and former Administrator. Janet came to the Club in 1993 and for more than five years looked after, befriended and laughed with us. A lover of cabaret, nightlife and fine martinis, she will be missed by all who knew her. There will be a memorial service at Calvary Church on November 18th at 1 PM. George S. Coyne II, President
