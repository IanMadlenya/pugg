        GOODSIDE--Victor, M.D. Of Mount Vernon, age 97, passed away peacefully at home, March 13, 2004. A graduate of Virginia Medical College, he had been a practicing clinician, scholar, and Chief of Ophthalmologic Surgery at Bronx Lebanon and Montefiore Hospitals. He pursued his multitude of interests with intellectual rigor and an elfin sense of humor. He is survived by his beloved wife of 69 years, Ray, and daughters Fran Feigert (Frank), Marian Goodside, and Elaine Stone (Bob). He was a devoted and proud brother to Grace Paley, brother-in-law to Evelyn Perlman, and grandpa to Ben, Dan, Liz and Amy. He had a great life, enriching so many, and we miss him already.
