        ROSENTHAL-Tim. We of the National Cartoonists Society profoundly mourn the untimely loss of our beloved friend, Tim Rosenthal, whose spirit, decency, professionalism, good will and boundless generosity graced our ranks for many years. Beyond all that, we will long remember Tim's incredible courage and grace while knowing the end was so near. Our condolences and love go out to his dear Robyn, Jennifer and Timmy, who ask that you memorialize Tim by helping the Scleroderma Foundation, Western NY Chapter, 5083 Morgan Parkway, Hamburg, NY 14075 (Attn: M.G. Henry, Sr.). We will miss our buddy Tim very much. May the skies where he is always be #
