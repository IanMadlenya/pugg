        DALLAS-Lewis. It is with great sorrow that the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System notes the passing of Dallas Lewis, MD, who was Chief of the Division of General Surgery at Franklin Hosptial Medical Center and a long time member of the hospital's medical staff. Dr. Lewis embodied the hospital's dedication to excellence in medicine. Our deepest sympathies go to his family.
