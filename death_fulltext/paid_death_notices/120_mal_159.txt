        MANDEL-Herbert R. Devoted husband of Lorraine and the late Miriam. Beloved father and father-in-law of Dr. Steven and Melanie Mandel, Henry Mandel, Linda Mandel and Dr. Arnold Lewis, and Vinny and Caroline Macchirole. Cherished grandfather of Matthew Mandel; Olivia, Lauren, Rachael, and Samuel Mandel; Sarah and Julie Woozley, David, Yoni and Arial Lewis; Kayleigh and Delaney Macchirole.

Memorial services will be held Thursday, January 16, at 12 noon, at ''Boulevard-Riverside Chapels'', 1450 Broadway, Hewlett, L.I. Should friends desire, in lieu of flowers our father's wishes were that donations be made to the Eastern Long Island Hospital, Manor Road, Greenport, New York 11944. Shiva will be observed at the Mandel Home in Greenport. His family will miss his strong presence and great zest for life.
        MANDEL-Herbert R. We'll miss you dearly-your companionship, your wit, your warmth, your generosity and zest for life. You've been a true friend, a mentor to our children, a loving husband and parent and a gentleman. Wishing you smooth sailing to your new horizons. Our prayers and heart felt condolences go out to the entire Mandel family. The Israels
