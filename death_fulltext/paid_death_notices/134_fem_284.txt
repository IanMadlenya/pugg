        RIPP-Gita. It is with great sadness that we note the passing of Gita Ripp (nee Kahan), beloved mother, sister, aunt and grandmother, on Sunday, March 29, 1998. She was a granddaughter of the philanthropist Chaim Kahan. Born in Baku, Russia, in 1909, she lived in Russia, Germany, France and the United States. She devoted her life to others. In lieu of flowers, contributions to DOROT Programs for the Elderly (171 W. 85th St., NYC 10024) in Gita's memory will be warmly appreciated. She is survived by her sister Lily Feiler, her sons Paul and Victor Ripp, her daughters-in-law Eleanor and Nancy, her grandchildren Daniel, Peter, Jonathan, Alexandra and a large family in Israel. Services will be held 10 AM, Tuesday, March 31, 1998, at Plaza Memorial Chapel, 91st St. and Amsterdam Ave.
        RIPP-Gita. Was so brave until the very end, and whose life inspired our children as well as her own. We will never forget her. In loving memory, Lily and Ali Feiler
