        AKS-Harold. The Dalton School is saddened by the loss of one of its most dedicated and loved teachers, Harold Aks. For over half a century, Harold inspired his students with a love of music and encouraged them to reach extraordinary levels in their musical performances. His magnetic personality and humor drew students and faculty to his side and brought them back to Dalton to sing under his direction. Following his retirement in 1997, Harold continued as the Director of the Alumni Chorus and was chosen this past spring by the Alumni Association to be honored as a former faculty member. Harold has touched the lives of so many students and brought such beautiful music to the school that it is hard to think of the place without him.
