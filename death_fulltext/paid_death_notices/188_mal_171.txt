        EMANUELSON - Jack. A painter, antiquarian, francophile extraordinaire died on September 11, 2002 after a lengthy and courageous battle with liver cancer and hepatitis C. A graduate of the School of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, Jack painted & lived with a vitality and style far more exotic than his conservative background. His continuing fascination with 18th and 19th century French culture led to his most treasured creation, the shop on 12th street known as ''Casita.'' Both witty and urbane, Jack will be especially remembered for his great kindness. His friends, family and clients will always cherish him and his beguiling embrace of beauty.
