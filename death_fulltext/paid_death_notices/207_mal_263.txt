        SPIRTES--David. The officers, directors and members of the Fire Island Association record, with deep sorrow, the untimely passing, on April 15, of David W. Spirtes, Superintendent of the Fire Island National Seashore. In less than a year on Fire Island, he changed the atmosphere from one of distrust and contention to one of open communication and cooperation. To his family and colleagues in the National Park Service, we extend our most sincere condolences.
