        BUCKOLD-Ellen. Beloved wife, mother, and grandmother, on Sunday morning, Nov. 15, 1998. She is survived by her husband, Werner, her daughters, Leslie SchweitzerMiller, and Emily Andelman, and her grandchildren, Marc and Gillian Schweitzer, and Ethan and Matthew Andelman. In addition to her devotion to her family, she was a role model to those who knew her, and leaves behind a legacy of concern and caring for the less fortunate. She volunteered her time to childrens' causes, served as President of both the Glen Cove and Long Island Chapters of B'nai Zion, and received a certificate of Congressional recognition for her other philanthropic work. She was blessed with many talents: a beautiful, lyric soprano voice, an artistic eye, a love of language and great literature, and a soaring and fertile imagination. She had music in her heart and poetry in her soul, and though all her memories were stolen, we will always remember. Services were held Tuesday, Nov. 17, 1998. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made to The Alzheimers Association, or B'nai Zion, 130 E. 39th St, NY, NY 10016.
