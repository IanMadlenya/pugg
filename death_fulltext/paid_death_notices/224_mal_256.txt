        MEISTER--Jack B. 78, Morristown, NJ. Adored by his wife, Lucille, and daughters, Andrea and Barbara. CCNY grad, WWII Navy vet, inventor, engineer, business owner. Respected for his integrity, ingenuity, talent and vision. Loved for his sense of humor and generous, sensitive spirit, his photography and poetry show-cased his soul.

Thank you, Jack, thank you, Daddy, for being the best, most loving husband and father in the world; for protecting, supporting, caring for and believing in us. Thank you for never letting us down, your strength and wisdom and the roses. We will always be proud of you and we love you with all our hearts.
