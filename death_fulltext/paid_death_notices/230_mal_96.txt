        PARRY -- George Kramer. Died on March 4, 2006 in New York City. Born on December 24, 1934, he was the son of Henry Laurens Parry and Olivia Kramer Parry of Great Neck, New York. A longtime resident of New York City and Stowe, VT, George will be greatly missed by his beloved wife, Catherine King Parry, his daughter, stepchildren, sisters and a legion of nieces and nephews. His energy, generosity and adventurous spirit enriched many lives. George skied for the University of Vermont where he was President of the SAE fraternity. His career on Wall Street spanned over 40 years. His life long participation in active sports took him to Stowe, VT. where he served until 2005 as a Mountain Host on Mount Mansfield. His passion for scuba diving and his love of Central Park provided him the unique opportunity to explore and beautify the Central Park reservoir. While diving in 1999, he discovered a section of the original reservoir fence, which is well over 100 years old. As a direct result of this discovery, the Central Park Conservancy has since then restored the fence to its original grandeur. A memorial service will be held at Brick Church, Park Ave & E 91st St, on Monday, March 13, 2006 at 11AM. In lieu of flowers please make contributions to the George K. Parry Memorial Fund, C/O the Central Park Conservancy, 14 East 60th St, New York, NY 10022.
