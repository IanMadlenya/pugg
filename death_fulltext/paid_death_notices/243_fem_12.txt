        HAVIVI--Rita, died March 30, at home, at peace, surrounded by family. Born in Bialystock, Poland, in 1916, educated in France and the U.S., Rita served in intelligence in Panama during World War II. Fluent in nine languages, she later taught French and Russian in public school; her love of sharing knowledge pervaded everything she did. She retired as an archivist from the Frick Museum in October after 24 years, upon completing a major project on Romanesque sculpture. She was familiar with Renaissance and modern art, music from Baroque to Stravinsky, European history and literature; she joyfully articulated tightly reasoned opinions on any topic. She leaves her loving sister Rhoda Salter, nephews, nieces and their children, many dear friends, and a slightly diminished New York.
