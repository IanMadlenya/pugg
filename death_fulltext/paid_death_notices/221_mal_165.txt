        WALLACE--Bert H. (Berthold Wallach). Of heart failure on June 11, at his home in Riverdale. Born to Baruch & Recha Wallach in Flieden, Germany, on July 15, 1915, Mr. Wallace fled Germany in April, 1939, settling first in Queens and then in Uniondale, LI. Beloved husband of Carol Lomnitz Wallace from Mainstockheim, Germany, and now deceased. Survived by his daughter Vivian and her husband Henry, his son John and his wife Deborah, his niece Lisa Levy, and his grandchildren Benjamin Wallace-Wells, David WallaceWells, Michael Wallace and Julia Wallace. An energetic participant and advocate in public affairs his entire adult life, Mr. Wallace in 1995 published ''The Rising Storm,'' a richly detailed memoir of his youth and flight from the terror of Hitler. He was a frequent contributor of letters and comments to numerous journals. His distinctive voice and vision will be greatly missed by all who knew him.
