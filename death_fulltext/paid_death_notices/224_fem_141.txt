        $(6$)SAGER--Dorothy. The officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Dorothy Sager, who together with her beloved husband, Irving, set a shining example of philanthropic leadership. The Sagers' deep commitment to the Jewish community and other humanitarian concerns was based on uncompromising standards of tzedakah. Such compassionate generosity placed the highest value not on the giver, but on the overwhelming influence of the gift. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Irving; to their son Tony; to their grandchildren Jessica and Diana; and to the entire Sager family. Morris W. Offit, President Susan K. Stern, Chair of the Board John S. Ruskay, Exec. V.P. & C.E.O.
