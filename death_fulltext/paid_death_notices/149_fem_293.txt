        BERNARD - Eileen. Treasured wife of Herbert, after a long and devastating illness slipped away on June 24, 1999 just four days after our 65th wedding anniversary. She was the mother of Migs Woodside and Lewis W. Bernard, grandmother of Geoffrey, Debbie, Adam and Claire. Great-grandmother of Rebecca and Emily. Eileen was a Leo, and lion-hearted in her more than 60 year struggle with an ever painful and threatening eye problem. She had a passion for Old Master Drawings, British antique yellow porcelain, Battersea and Bilston enamels, Regency furniture and visiting Trust Houses. She was a member of the drawing committee at CooperHewitt Museum, a trustee at AllenStevenson School, a Vice-President of Playschools Association, and a Vice-President of the Jewish Welfare Board during the war years, and worked as a USO hostess at the Emanu-El canteen. She was a member of the Board of Directors of Womens' Division of Federation and the American Jewish Committee. She was devoted to ballet, good music, opera, travel, stimulating lectures, museums, and hostessing, with great flair, happy parties at our 911 Penthouse. Eileen was a wonderful daughter, concerned mother, and anyone who knew her and worked with her realized how inspiring she was and always gave of herself to the utmost. Contributions in her memory to the Museum Acquisitions Fund of Temple Emanu-El, 1 E. 65 St, NY, 10021 would be appreciated by her family. Good night ''Blithe Spirit'', sleep well, ''Fairest of the Fair''. You deserve it. Herbert
