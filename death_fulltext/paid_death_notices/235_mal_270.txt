        AUSTIN--Ernest Allen, Jr., passed on Sunday, August 27th in Cresskill, NJ. He was born November 9th, 1933 in Stoneham, MA. After serving in the Air Force during the Korean War, Ernie attended Emerson College and began his lifelong love affair with the theatre and acting. He relocated to NYC in the late '50s to pursue a career as an actor. His stage credits include ''Ballad of the Sad Cafe,'' ''Do I Hear a Waltz,'' ''Hamlet'' and ''The Merry Wives of Windsor.'' Ernie was stage manager on the Broadway productions ''Half a Sixpence'' and ''Hallelujah, Baby!'' where he met his former wife, Judith, who also performed in Broadway musicals as a dancer.

Ernie is survived by his sister Betty, brother Billy, his two sons, Michael and Stephen, and four grandchildren, Erin, Emily, Kevin and Mark. Ernie was well known for his jovial personality and sense of humor. He often raised a glass and exclaimed ''Broadway Ernie's my name, show business is my game!''
