        SPIGLAND-Sheilah. The President, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and the entire Montefiore Medical Center community are deeply saddened by the passing of Sheilah Spigland, beloved and devoted wife of Ilya Spigland, M.D., Director of the Division of Virology at Montefiore. Mrs. Spigland was an extremely enthusiastic member of the Medical Center's Auxiliary. Her devotion to the patient library where she served as Chairperson of the Auxiliary's Library Committee and where in recent years she could be found almost every day, will leave a void that will be difficult to fill. We offer our deepest condolences to Dr. Spigland; their two daughters Nitsana Spigland-Kudler, M.D. and Caren Spigland-Turner; their son Ethan Spigland and their entire family. Spencer Foreman, M.D., Pres. Jay B. Langner, Chairman Board of Trustees Montefiore Medical Center
