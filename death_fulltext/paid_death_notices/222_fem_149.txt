        DWORETZ--Mildred, at home, on July 24, at 92 years of age. Profoundly loved wife of the late Philip L. Dworetz. Beloved mother of Susan and Peter Ralston, Linda and Dan Baron, and Steven Dworetz and Susan Taylor. She was the adored ''Nanny'' of her grandchildren, Bob and Merritt Rollins, Laura Marlin, Carrie Baron, Debra Baron, Charles Dworetz, and Rawley Dworetz, and of her greatgrandchildren, Alex and Lucy Rollins, Julia and Sarah Marlin, and Sierra Lieb. To our bereft family and to her many friends she was a constant source of love, encouragement, sympathy, and understanding. She was a woman of valor, intelligence, and wisdom, with a wideranging and lively interest in many subjects. Her generosity was boundless. We will remember her warmth and kindness forever.
