        BLAKEMAN--Edith Hughes. Died peacefully on September 3, 2005, at Long Beach Memorial Center. She adored, and was adored by, Royal, her devoted husband for over 60 years, her caring daughter Carol, who was born at Long Beach Medical Center, her loving granddaughter Jamie Forrest, whose success in business made her very happy, and wonderful son-in-law Rev. Stephen Shick. She will be missed by numerous nephews, nieces and cousins. She was proud of her service in WWII as a parachute rigger in the Coast Guard. She enjoyed a good joke and a good book. She loved flowers and the Mets and she loved to sing. She knew the lyrics of almost every standard song. The song is ended but the melody lingers on, ''Dream a Little Dream of Me.'' Private service.
