        KNIPE--Andy. The Board of Directors and staff of The ALS Association, Greater New York Chapter, are deeply saddened by the loss of our esteemed Board member, Andy Knipe. In his valiant struggle against ALS, Andy, much like his hero Lou Gehrig, never complained or despaired. For those who worked alongside him and were deeply stirred by his courage, he will remain a symbol of hope for many others who are equally afflicted. We extend heartfelt sympathy to his devoted wife Laura and family. Alan Griffith, Chairman John Ernst, Chair Emeritus Dorine Gordon, President Jackie Reinhard, Exec. Dir.
