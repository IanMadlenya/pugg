        EINSTEIN-Ernst, a partner in Einstein-Moomjy, The Carpet Department Store, died suddenly on Wednesday. He was 76 years old. He died from complications associated with cancer. He continued to be active in the business while living with Parkinson's disease for the last 25 years. Born in Frankfurt, Germany, Ernst Einstein fled Nazi Germany in 1933. With the help of his future wife, Charline, he escaped the Nazis by hiding in France under a false identity. He was a kind man who survived the war without bitterness. After the war, he lived in France until moving to New Jersey in 1955. That year, he formed a partnership with his identical twin brother, Ted Einstein, and Albert and Walter Moomjy, which created the carpet business now known as EinsteinMoomjy, Inc. The chain today consists of five locations, four in New Jersey and one in Manhattan. Einstein was known for his exquisite taste and vision and for his expertise and fine eye for oriental rugs. As one example, in 1971, when Nixon first lifted the embargo on trade with China, he flew to London so that Einstein-Moomjy would be the first to import oriental rugs from China. He was gracious and charming and equally loved by customers and employees. Above all, he was an affectionate husband, father and grandfather. In addition to his wife, the former Charline Ollier, he is survived by two daughters, Rita Davis of Bryn Mawr, Penn., and Jessica Kaufman of Easton, Conn., and two sons, Jean Einstein of Westwood, N.J., and Gilles Einstein of Greenville, S.C., and 10 grandchildren. The memorial service is scheduled for 10 AM Sunday, October 3, at Higgins and Bonner Echo Lake Funeral Home, 582 Springfield Ave., in Westfield, N.J. Memorial donations may be made to the Melvin D. Yahr Parkinson's Research Fund, Mt. Sinai Medical Center, 5 E. 98th St., 7th Floor, New York, NY 10029.
