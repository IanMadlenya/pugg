        SOBEL-Pearl. On February 12, 2001, after a long and blessed life, Pearl Orloff Sobel passed away peacefully after a brief illness. She is survived by her husband of sixty-two years, Gerson, her children, James, Judith, and Thomas, and her grandchildren, Paul, Eric, Lisa, David, and Daniel. Energetic and vigorous to the end, Pearl loved her family and friends. She held records as a Master Swimmer in the 100 Medley and 50 Butterfly, a feat made even more remarkable by the fact that she did not even begin to swim until she was over sixty-five. A Memorial Service will be held on Wednesday, February 14th, 2:30 P.M. at ''Gutterman's Inc'', 175 Long Beach Road, RVC.
