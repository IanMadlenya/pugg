        HOROWITZ--Lewis. Age 58, unexpectedly and tragically passed away on Saturday, May 15. A man who traveled many diverse paths in his life, which came to its end much too soon. He will be missed by all those whose life he touched, most especially Elaine, his partner in life, and her children and grandchildren. Some people are measured by what they collect, most assuredly Lewis would be deemed wealthy by the count of those who will mourn his loss. Memorial service Thursday, May 20 at 4PM at ''The Riverside'' 76th St. and Amsterdam Ave.
