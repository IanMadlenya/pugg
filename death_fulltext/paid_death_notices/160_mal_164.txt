        UCHIMA-Ansei. Sarah Lawrence College notes with sorrow the death of emeritus faculty member, Ansei Uchima, on May 9, 2000. Distinguished artist and revered teacher, he provided a guiding vision for our studio arts program for 20 years until his retirement in 1982. We extend our deepest sympathy to his devoted family.
