        GREENSPAN--Ezra M. It is with profound sorrow that the Mount Sinai Alumni mourns the passing of our dear friend and colleague. Founder and First Medical Director of the Chemotherapy Foundation, Dr. Greenspan was a consummate educator who brought intellect, wisdom, great clinical skills, vast expertise and personal integrity to the task of training young physicians. Not only in the forefront of research in medical oncology, he was primarily and especially a personal doctor to all his patients throughout the world. Devoted to medicine, Mount Sinai and its alumni, Dr. Greenspan served as President of the Association in 1968. In 1982, the Mount Sinai Alumni presented its most coveted award, the Jacobi Medallion, to Dr. Greenspan in acknowledgement of his profound professional achievements and his extraordinary service to the medical center and the Alumni. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his entire family. William Stein, M.D., Pres. Barry Stimmel, M. D., VP Elliot Rayfield, M.D., Secretary Betty Mintz, M.D.,Treasurer
