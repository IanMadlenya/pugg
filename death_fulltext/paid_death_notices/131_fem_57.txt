        MEREDITH-Erlene, on December 3, 1997, our family lost our cherished friend after her long and valiant battle with ovarian cancer. She was an unforgettable presence in the lives of all who knew her. With love and enthusiasm, she dedicated her life to the operatic career of her husband, Morley Meredith, distinguished baritone with the Metropolitan Opera for over thirty years. With her dynamic personality and dramatic flair, she brought friends and colleagues, artist and impresarios into her family circle. Erlene brightened every operatic occasion, backstage and off-stage, and at home in Scarsdale at ''Villa Voce,'' where she entertained in great style. Her generosity of heart and indomitable spirit remain forever with us. Emily and Eugene Grant Terry, Andrea and Carolyn Grant
