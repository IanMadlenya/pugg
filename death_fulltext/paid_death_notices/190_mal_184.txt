        HANNA-Roland, Sir. The faculty, students and colleagues of the Aaron Copland School of Music at Queens College mourn, with profound sadness, the passing of this great man, Sir Roland Hanna. Consummate artist, pianist extraordinaire, teacher, advisor, composer, arranger, a man whose generosity of spirit and warmth embraced so many people as he did so many musical styles. A member of the faculty since 1992, Sir Roland influenced countless students and professionals, many of whom have gone on to important careers. A loss that cannot be measured. A scholarship fund will be established in his honor.
