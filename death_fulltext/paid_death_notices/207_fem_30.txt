        BARHAM--Betty, 79, livosopher and poet, died gracefully in her sleep on Sunday, March 28, 2004. Betty will be remembered by thousands of people who received her ''55'' pin and her ''22/55'' message to ''change your point of view''. She lived in Manhattan for 27 years, savoring every minute of the energy and electricity of a city that perfectly matched her personality. Betty was loved and will be greatly missed by her friends and family: Sandy and Stu Nahan; Richard, Barbara, Whitney and Dagny Mendelsohn; Helen, Gabriel, Carole and Corky Kovacs. Donations may be made in Betty's memory to Hospice by the Bay, 1540 Market St., San Franciso, CA. 94102-6035. Betty always said, ''I want to be alive when I die''...and she was.
