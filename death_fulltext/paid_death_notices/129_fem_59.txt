        GOLD-Mary Jayne. The International Rescue Committee mourns the passing of Mary Jayne Gold. In the dark days of 1941-42, she was a genuine heroine who saved many of Europe's leading artists and intellectuals trapped in Marseilles and seemingly destined for Hitler's extermination camps. Her courage, compassion and generosity were critical in their rescue. We honor her memory and her deeds. She was a living example of how one person can truly make a difference. John C. Whitehead, Chairman Leo Cherne, Chairman Emeritus Charles Sternberg, Secretary Reynold Levy, President
