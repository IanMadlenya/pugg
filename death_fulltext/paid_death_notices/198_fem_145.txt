        WIGDERSON -- Dorothy Marks of Atlanta, Georgia, formerly of Queens and Valley Cottage, New York, on July 17 at age 91. Widow of Henry Wigderson; much loved mother of Jon, Seth, and Kate; caring mother-inlaw of Susan Eller Wigderson, Julie Guard, and Phillip King; beloved grandmother of Adam, Melissa, and Jonathan and Sueann Wigderson, Bronwyn Guard, and Patrick King; great-grandmother of Jonathan and Courtney Wigderson and Jennifer Zagami; and darling sister of Estelle Leontief. She was a unique and special woman, who helped and inspired in many ways: from her early career as a teacher, through her childrearing years, then to a new career as a marriage counselor, and after retirement continuing to read and listen and learn, she became the poet laureate of her retirement residence. Dorothy was a superb human being, accomplished, generous, and loving. She was a dear friend of all she knew and loved. >>AD#
