        FINK--Austin. The SUNY Downstate Medical Center community mourns the passing of Austin Fink, M.D., former Professor of Ophthalmology and a world-renowned physician.

We extend our deepest sympathy to his family, colleagues and friends. John C. LaRosa, M.D., President Eugene B. Feigelson, M.D. Sr. V.P. and Dean of the College of Medicine Kevin C.
