        FLEISHAKER--Dorothy. The Board of Directors and staff of HIAS, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, sadly mourn the passing of Dorothy Fleishaker, beloved wife of HIAS Board member Donald J. Fleishaker. The Fleishakers' commitment to living a life enriched by and connected to Jewish tradition and values as well as passing it on to their children and grandchildren set an example for all of us. The Fleishakers have for many years been major contributors to the success of HIAS' worldwide mission of refugee resettlement and relief and particularly the HIAS Scholarship Program for immigrant students in the United States and Israel. We extend our deepest sympathy to Donald Fleishaker and the entire Fleishaker family. May her memory be for a blessing.
        FLEISHAKER -- Dorothy L. Passed away July 11. Beloved wife of Donald; loving mother of Sandy and Tim Wuliger, Rhoda and Craig Smolow, Abbe Fleishaker, and Sheryl and Aaron Fleishaker. Proud grandmother of 11 wonderful grandchildren. Funeral services at Beth El Synagogue, New Rochelle, New York, at 10 A.M., July 13, 2005.
