        HOCHBERG--Marvin. The Graenum Berger Bronx Jewish Federation Service Center expresses profound sorrow on the passing of Marvin Hochberg, one of our founders. He personified the fundamental Jewish teaching that we are created to do good for others. His commitment to chesed and tzedakah through compassion, diligence and excellence, inspires and serves as a role model. May the Almighty comfort his beloved wife, Bella, children Rifki, Zev and Shani, and the entire family among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
