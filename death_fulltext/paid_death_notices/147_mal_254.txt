        HARRIS-Nathan, age 95, jeweler. Retired president of B. Harris and Sons, Jewelers, originally established as the first retail jewelry store on West 47th Street in 1926, died last Monday at the Jewish Home for the Elderly in Fairfield, CT. Together with his late brother, Charles, he owned and lovingly piloted one of the leading antique jewelry establishments in NYC for nearly seven decades, striving always to provide the right object for the right occasion, at a reasonable price consistent with the high quality of the merchandise, and his clientele included many of the artistic, literary, musical and theatrical leading lights of the time. The store, evolving through later reincarnations on East 48 and East 61 Streets, finally closed in 1991 with his retirement. He was as well a rare chamber musician, occupying first violin chair in his ''Tanglefoot String Quartet'' for some sixty years of joyous amateur music-making. Born on Thanksvgiving Day 1903, he was a liferaft and an anchor for many, at a time when there are few human heroes. When asked what mattered to him most, he said, ''Each day, to give meaning to the lives touched by mine.'' He will be sorely missed by many. Mr. Harris' wife, the former Denah Josephson, predeceased him in 1993. He is survived by a son and a daughter, Michael Harris of Easton, CT., and Susan Harris of Bridgeport, CT.
