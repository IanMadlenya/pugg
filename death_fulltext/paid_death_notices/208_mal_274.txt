Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, Inc., expresses its deep sorrow at the passing of Gerald Shukow, beloved husband of Blanche, of blessed memory, cherished father of Marjorie Shukow, Judith and Moshe Mann, Susan and Ira Shapiro, and doting grandfather of Rachel Scheinberg, Jonathan Mann and Rebecca and David Shapiro.
