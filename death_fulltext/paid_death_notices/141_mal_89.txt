        TROY-Rabbi Albert. We record with sorrow the passing of our beloved colleague who served Temple B'nai Abraham in Meriden, CT from 1951-1977 after his army chaplaincy during World War II where he dedicated himself to helping Displaced Persons. After his retirement, he was instrumental in the establishment of a number of synagogues in the South Florida area. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his daughters Deborah, Naomi and Melanie and to his sister Rosalyn. Rabbi Seymour L. Essrog, President Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Executive Vice President The Rabbinical Assembly
