        FOX-Bill. On Saturday, June 1, 2002, Bill Fox, age 50, left this world after suffering fatal injuries from a bicycle accident. Cyclist, baker, kaleidoscope maker, he was above all loving, thoughtful and generous with himself in the most creative ways. We, his family, will miss his delightful presence and will honor him by trying to live and love to the fullest. Funeral Tuesday, June 4, 7 PM, at Ralston Lippincott, 72 West Main St, Middletown, NY. Ces, Alice, Laurie, Andy, Roger and family
