        FOY--Geraldine F. Sparrowbush, NY and formerly of Englewood, NJ. Mrs. Geraldine F. Foy, a devoted mother of three, a Mets fan and lover of animals, died Sunday, October 22, 2006 at the age of 79. She was born January 18, 1927 in New York, NY the daughter of the late John Fitz Maurice and the late Edith Persen FitzGerald. She grew up in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and attended Barnard and Kathryn Gibbs. After spending a year in Paris, she joined the United Nations, in 1955, where she met her future husband, John C. W. Foy, an Englishman also of the United Nations. They were married in 1957 and lived happily together until his death, in 1997. During the 1950s and 1960s, she made many transAtlantic voyages on the great ocean liners and traveled extensively with her family through Western Europe. In the 1960s she took on the most challenging job of all: a full-time mother of three. She is survived by her son, John F. Foy; her daughters Penelope B. Sciortino and Jennifer F. Schalhoub; her sister Patricia McWilliams; her grandchildren, Catherine and Christopher Foy and Sarah and Stephanie Sciortino. Mrs. Foy, who loved her family and her home above all else, said toward the end of her life that the three most important things were to love and be loved, to be kind and compassionate, and to be honest. This was her great gift. Dear Mom, it is hard to say goodbye. Visitation and funeral services will be private at the family home. Memorial contributions may be made to any animal organization of donor's choice. Gray-Parker Funeral Home 845.856.5191 www.grayparkerfunerla home.com
