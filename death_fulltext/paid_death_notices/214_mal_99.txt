        COUNTS--Dr. Robert M., on November 3, in New York City. Born in Rossville, Kansas in 1924, he practiced psychiatry in Massachusetts and the greater New York area for five decades. Dr. Counts earned his medical degree from Washington University in St. Louis. He was the first director of the Children's Psychiatric Center of Monmouth County, NJ and founded the Center for Marital and Family Therapy in New York City. He was also a member of the voluntary faculty at NYU School of Medicine. Dr. Counts served tours of duty in the Army during World War II and the Korean War. An avid traveler, photographer and squash player, his first priority was always his family and friends. He is survived by his loving wife Norma Hakusa Counts, his brother Jim, his children Pamela, Douglas, Alexander and Michael, and a network of caring extended family and friends. A private memorial service will be held in New York City on November 22. In lieu of flowers, contributions in his memory may be made to Doctors Without Borders.
