        ORNSTEIN-Albert. The Fund for New Priorities in America, mourns the passing of Albert Ornstein, a founding member and longtime Board member. Albert's commitment to the pursuit of peace and justice was an inspiration to all who knew him and will be sorely missed. Our sympathies go out to his widow, Miriam, a lifelong partner in his efforts to create a better world. Maurice Paprin, Robert Boehm Co Chairs
