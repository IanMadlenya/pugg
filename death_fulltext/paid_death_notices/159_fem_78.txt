        SCHAFFER-Beverly (aka Bebby Dear). Of Scarsdale, NY, and Delray Beach, FL, daughter of the late Max Borodkin and sister of the late Sheldon, survived by her mother Mary. She depended upon and loved, with humor and adoration, her husband of 53 years, ''Dear'' (Stanley). She was a capable yachtswoman and jovial golfer. Her pride and pleasure from her children, Laurie & Ellis Disick, and Dean & Cathie Schaffer, were legendary. ''Grandmother'' had so much joy when she was with any of her three grandsons, Grant, Evan or Paul. Services 10 AM, Tuesday, Westchester Reform Temple. Donations please to American Cancer Society.
        SCHAFFER-Beverly. We will cherish your love, humor and warmth. We will miss you. Ellen and Sabin
