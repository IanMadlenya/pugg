        MINTZ-Ira, MD. Passed away on February 9, 1999, at age 72. The members of the NJ Psychoanalytic Society mourn the loss of their esteemed friend and colleague. Dr. Mintz served as president of the NJ Psychoanalytic Society and was an eminent psychiatrist and psychoanalyst. Dr. Mintz wrote and lectured extensively in the field of clinical psychoanalysis, particularly about the treatment of difficult psychosomatic patients. He was respected and loved by his colleagues. He was a tireless teacher and a devoted clinician, renowned for his delicacy and skill with patients who were severely afflicted with psychosomatic symptoms. Dr. Mintz was patient, calm and understanding, ready to make us smile with wit and humor. We will be inspired by his memory.
