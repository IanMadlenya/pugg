        RAND - William. The Jewish Museum mourns the passing of our Honorary Trustee, William Rand, whose personal passion for art and music inspired an enlightened patronage of New York's cultural institutions. Together with his late wife, Muriel, William Rand took great joy in building an art collection that has immeasurably strengthened the holdings of The Jewish Museum. His deeply held belief that the arts should be accessible to all led him to establish a fund that will perpetuate the Rands' commitment to cultural education. We admired his intelligence and integrity as we enjoyed his charm and style. We extend our sincerest condolences to his daughter, Kathi, and her family. Robert J. Hurst, Chairman Philip A. Laskawy, President Joan Rosenbaum, Director
