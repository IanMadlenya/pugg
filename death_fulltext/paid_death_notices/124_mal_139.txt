        WHITSETT-Curtis Mosley. Beloved husband of Patricia, devoted father of Curice, Camille, Jackline and Tamara. Cherished son of Vera and L.T. Whitsett, friend and counsellor to many, died May 10, 1997 in New York of congestive heart failure. Curtis was a friend, in his youth, of Martin Luther King, Jr., and participated in several civil rights marches with Dr. King. At his death, he was the director of Intake at Reality House, a drug rehabilitation program. Curt was equally proud of his career and his family. He was principled and a gentleman in the finest sense of that word. The world has been enriched by his presence. He will be missed by all who knew him. Funeral May 14, 6:30 P.M., at Walter B. Cooke, West 72nd Street. The family requests that in lieu of flowers contributions be sent to the Children's Blood Foundation, 333 East 38th Street, New York City 10016.
        WHITSETT-Curtis. The Friends of the Children's Blood Foundation extend their heartfelt condolences to Pat on the passing of her dear husband, Curt. Together they have been our very special friends. We wish to extend our sincerest sympathy to the family. Susan R. Byrne, Exec Director Janice Garjian, Chair, Friends of CBF
