        LINDSAY-Derek. The Faculty and Staff of the Chemistry Department of the City College of New York deeply regret the loss of our long-time friend and colleague, Professor Derek Lindsay. Professor Lindsay, an outstanding experimental chemist and a recognized authority in the area of electron spin resonance spectroscopy, joined our Department in 1978 with a Ph.D. from Harvard University. He was a respected member of a community of scientists striving to understand how metals form and how their properties arise as metal atoms come together in small clusters. Professor Lindsay was held in high regard by his students and colleagues, and they will miss him. At this very difficult time, we extend our condolences and sympathy to his wife, Margaret, and mother, Sylvia.
