        GOLDSTEIN - Gertrude of NYC. Died peacefully at 89, April 18, in California after a full life first with her parents, Morris and Fannie Gold, and her brothers, the late Abraham, and surviving Irv and Hy Gold, and with her beloved late husband, Jack Goldstein. She had a warm family with daughter Sylvana Candela (Melva), grandchildren Tina, Heather, Madeline, Adam and Josh, all of whom she adored and who cherished her. Gertrude had a wide circle of loving family, especially sisters-in-law Selma, Nina and Ruth, and many friends she knew for decades. After graduating from Thomas Jefferson HS in Brooklyn, she worked as a commercial secretary and then as a valued school secretary in several NYC high schools. In WWII, she served in Africa in the Women's Army Corps, and was one of the oldest surviving WAC members. Before and after retirement, she was active in sports (table tennis), bridge, theater and opera-going, read widely and traveled extensively with Jack. She also supported many progressive organizations such as Teachers Union, Southern Poverty Law Center, and Gay Mens Health Crisis. Gertrude's spirit will never leave us, and we will remember her for years to come as one of the most caring and wisest people ever to come into our lives. Services in CA and NY will be announced.
