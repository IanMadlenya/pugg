        ROGERS--Reita (nee Berlat). June 23, 1918-May 14, 2005. Our mom died suddenly on Saturday, and will be surely missed by all. She joins her beloved Pete and she may now rest in peace. She would have been a young, beautiful 87. She will also be missed by her friends and all of her animals. Donations may be sent to Animal Medical Hospital, NYC, or ASPCA. Love, Beth, Jeff and John, Tess and Wanda
