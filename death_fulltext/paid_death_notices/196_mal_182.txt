        RAPHAN-Benjamin . We are shocked and deeply saddened by the untimely passing of our cherished friend and colleague. Throughout his nearly four decades of service with our firm as a business and corporate attorney, Ben's calm demeanor and dispassionate approach drew us to him for advice and counsel-we trusted his judgment. As a managing partner of Tenzer Greenblatt, Blank Rome's New York predecessor, he was also a major part of what bound us together as a firm. A teasing remark, a mock frown or a kind word of encouragement made him a beloved father figure and mentor to attorneys and staff alike. Beneath his straightforward style of drafting, negotiating and counseling lay a tremendous depth of legal knowledge respected and sought out by both clients and colleagues. Our hearts go out to Myrna, Howard and Carla, Stacy and Len, and Ben's adoring grandchildren. We hope they will be comforted by the knowledge of how much he meant to so many. Blank Rome LLP
