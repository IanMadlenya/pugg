        GOTTSEGEN-Irving. Age 81. Died suddenly at his home in Bedford Hills, N.Y., on September 4, 1997. A man who brought the same warmth, humor, patience, and love he showed his family to his forty year career as a hospital administrator. After service in the Second World War, he went to Montefiore Hospital for Chronic Diseases and then to Montefiore's Country Sanitarium, overseeing early drug treatments for tuberculosis. He then returned to Montefiore in the Bronx, serving in a variety of administrative positions. Until his retirement as Sr. Associate Director in 1986, his was the human face of medicine. He will be deeply missed by all his friends and by his wife Katherine, his sons, Mark David and Matthew; their wives, Emilie and Susan; and his granddaughters, Katherine and Sarah. A memorial gathering will be held at a later date, to be announced. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the UJAFederation of Jewish Philanthropies.
        GOTTSEGEN-Irving. The Auxiliary of Montefiore Medical Center is deeply saddened by the passing of Irving Gottsegen. Beloved friend and guiding counselor to all of us. He was associated with the hospital for 40 years and after retiring he became a dedicated member of the Auxiliary. To his wife Katherine, sons Mark and Matthew and the grandchildren we extend our sincerest sympathies. Ruth Saporta, President Mary Goldsmith, Secretary
