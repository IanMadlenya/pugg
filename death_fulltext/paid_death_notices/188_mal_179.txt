        WANKOWICZ-Andrew Henry. Died suddenly on September 16th at age 82. Beloved husband of Helen, devoted father of Alexandra, and father-in-law of William Allen. His daughter Erika predeceased him. Andrew was born on February 6, 1920 in Poznan, Poland into a prominent noble family, the son of the late Senator and Mrs. Stanislaw Wankowicz. He attended the Universities of Poznan, Rome and London. He escaped from Nazi occupied Poland, and joined the second Polish Corps in the Middle East during World War II, where he served as a lieutenant and fought in the campaigns of Tobruk and Monte Cassino. For his heroism, he was awarded Poland's highest military honor, the order of Virtuti Militari, the Croce al valor militare by the King of Italy, as well as other awards from the British government. Because the Communists confiscated his family estates, he emigrated to England and in 1950, to the United States, where he joined the Atalanta Trading Corporation. With his charm and good manners, he epitomized the courtly European gentleman. The family will receive friends at The Westchester Funeral Home, Inc., Eastchester, Wednesday 2-4 and 7-9 PM. A service will be held at the funeral home on Thursday, September 19th at 11:30 A.M., followed by interment at the Gate of Heaven Cemetery.
