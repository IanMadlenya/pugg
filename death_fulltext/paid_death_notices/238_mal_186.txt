        MIRA-Y-LOPEZ--Rafael. The Samuel Bronfman Department of Medicine of The Mount Sinai Medical Center is saddened by the passing of Rafael Mira-Y-Lopez, M.D., Ph.D. An internationally known cell biologist, his work demonstrated the importance of vitamin A controlled genes in the development of breast cancer. He was a modest man with remarkable intellect and devotion to science, who set an example of excellence for his students and colleagues. We are grateful for his many years of dedicated service. Our sincere sympathy is extended to his family and friends. Paul Klotman, M.D., Chair Department of Medicine George Atweh, M.D., Chief Hematology and Medical Oncology
