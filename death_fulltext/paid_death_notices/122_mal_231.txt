        MANN-David Hazzan. We record in sorrow the passing of the Hazzam Emeritus of Temple Gates of Zion in Valley Stream, NY for over four decades. Quietly and gently he served the spiritual needs of his congregants with great dignity, warmth and care. A dedicated hazzan, he became a member of the Cantors Assembly in its earliest days, and remained an active participant winning the admiration and respect of collegues and congregants alike. We extend our sympathy to his wife, Frances, his children Thelma and Zachary, and all his loved ones. May his memory abide as a blessing. Hazzan Abraham Lubin, President Hazzan Samuel Rosenbaum, Executive Vice President
