        GREEN-Arthur H., M.D. The Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at Columbia University and New York Presbyterian Hospital is deeply saddened by the loss of Arthur H. Green, M.D., Clinical Professor of Psychiatry (in Pediatrics). Dr. Green, a member of our faculty for two decades, was an internationally known pioneer in the research and treatment of child physical and sexual abuse. His compassionate understanding of the causes and effects of child maltreatment led to two major child abuse preventive programs at our medical center-the Family Center and Therapeutic Nursery, in which countless children and parents are treated, and numerous mental health professionals receive training. Dr. Green's work greatly influenced the manner in which child abuse cases are managed in the United States, and the programs he helped establish serve as models throughout the world. He will be sorely missed as clinician, teacher, colleague, friend, and mentor to many generations of students. We extend our sincere condolences to his wife, Carol, daughter, Susan, and son, Jonathan.
