        WESTHEIMER - Manfred. The Board of Directors, Staff and members of the YM & YWHA of Washington Hts. and Inwood express profound sorrow on the passing of Fred Westheimer, the husband of our esteemed president, Dr. Ruth Westheimer. Fred was an aficionado of classical music and an active supporter of our Sunday Concert Series. He loved the Washington Hts. community, especially Ft. Tryon Park, where he spent considerable time appreciating nature. Fred strongly supported Ruth as president of our Y, where she plays a vital leadership role. Despite her busy professional schedule, Dr. Ruth's compassion and concern, especially for the elderly, has enabled our Y to be on the cutting edge of services to this community. Our deepest sympathies to Ruth, and their children, Dr. Miriam (Joel Einleger) Westheimer and Dr. Joel (Barbara) Westheimer and grandchildren. Robert Lautin, M.D., Jeffery M. Loewy, Ben Zinken, Vice Presidents Martin G. Englisher Executive Vice President
