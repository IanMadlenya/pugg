        LINZER-Estelle. The Eleanor Roosevelt Center at Val-Kill (ERVK), Hyde Park, New York, mourns the loss of former Board President Estelle Linzer. She worked and traveled with Eleanor Roosevelt at the American Association for the United Nations (now UNA-USA) from 1953 until Mrs. Roosevelt's death in 1962. She was a vital link to Mrs. Roosevelt's legacy and an inspiration to the ERVK's programs. We admired her modesty and her dignity. ERVK Board of Directors, staff and friends
