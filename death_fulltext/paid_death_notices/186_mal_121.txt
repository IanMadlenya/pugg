        BROWN-Earle. The Directors and staff of the Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts, Inc., mourn the loss of Earle Brown, who received a grant for his music the first year of the organization's operations in 1963, and was awarded The John Cage Award for Music in 1998. He was a much-admired friend. Our sympathies to his wife, Susan Sollins, and the family.
