        SHIRK-Dr. Evelyn Urban Buchler. Hofstra University is profoundly saddened by the death of Dr. Evelyn Urban Buchler Shirk, Professor Emerita of Philosophy. Professor Shirk died on August 24, 1997 after a short illness. She graduated cum laude with her A.B. degree from Wilson College, and earned her M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Columbia University. She came to Hofstra in 1949 as an Assistant Professor of Philosophy, became a full professor in 1963, and in 1967 became Department Chair. She was President of Hofstra's AAUP Chapter and of the faculty honor society, Sigma Kappa Alpha, which preceded Hofstra's Phi Beta Kappa Chapter, in which she also served as President. In tribute to the memory of Professor Shirk, all Hofstra University flags have been lowered to half staff. James M.
