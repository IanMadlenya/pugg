        D'ARMS-John H. It is with deep sorrow that the American Academy of Arts and Sciences mourns the loss of John D'Arms, distinguished scholar, President of the American Council of Learned Societies, and Fellow of the Academy for the past ten years. His wide scholarly interests and administrative skills made him one of this nation's leading advocates for humanistic study. He will be remembered for his efforts to create an extensive program of fellowships to support new research in the humanities. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Teresa, to his family, and to all those who benefited from his wisdom and generous spirit. President Patricia Meyer Spacks, Vice-President Louis Cabot, Secretary Emilio Bizzi, Treasurer Peter Lynch, Executive Executive Officer Leslie Berlowitz.
