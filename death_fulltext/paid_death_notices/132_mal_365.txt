        NEU-Harold C. The faculty, staff and current and past students and fellows of the Divisions of infectious Diseases in internal Medicine and in Pediatrics sadly mourn the passing of Harold C. Neu, M.D. He was a dynamic leader, a distinguished investigator in development and use of antimicrobials, a charismatic and innovative teacher, a dedicated physician, and a warm and generous person. We will always remember him. We send our sincere condolences to his loving and devoted family: his wife Carmen Ortiz-Neu, M.D., and children Harold A. Neu, Maria Neu Rorer, and Natalie Neu, M.D. and his granddaughter Katherine Rorer.
