        CUFFE-Edward W. 2/16/36-6/5/96. A pirate between piracies-Fall River Irishman in search of original sin. He ran money like Rimbaud ran guns. Bars and cemeteries are full of good friends. He was born with the gift of laughter and with a feeling that the world was mad. This was his entire inheritance. As Dr. Johnson said of Garrick, ''His death eclipsed the gaiety of nations and impoverished the public stock of harmless pleasure.'' He has gone to where savage indignation can no longer lacerate his heart. Go traveler, try and imitate him if you can. He served liberty. We can become frozen in our attachment and fear or we can recognize the liberation of our true nature. Rage on wherever you are. The Ding Ansich Dynasty
