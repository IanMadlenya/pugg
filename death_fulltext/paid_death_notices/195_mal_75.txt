        CORNELL-George D. Cornell University mourns the passing of George Cornell, a man who claims a solid place in the history of the University and in the hearts of many alumni, friends, and staff members. A distant cousin of the University's founder, George shared Ezra Cornell's commitment to education and accessibility to it. ''Education is what made our country great,'' he said, explaining one of the largest scholarship gifts the University ever received, which he made with his wife, Harriet. George and Harriet endowed the Edward Cornell Librarianship and the Edward F. Cornell Professorship of Law at the Cornell University Law School, both named for George's father who received his Cornell law degree in 1890. They took the lead to renovate Bailey Hall, a 90-year-old concert hall and campus landmark. Ever active and involved with Cornell, George served as a presidential councillor up until his death and hosted and attended many University events in both Florida and New York. In 1988, he and Harriet were named foremost benefactors, an honor bestowed on the University's most generous patrons. The Cornell University community expresses its sincere condolences to George Cornell's sisters, Katherine Stainton and Phebe Maresi; and his two nieces and nephew, Alice, Beatrice, and Henry Maresi, who survive him.
