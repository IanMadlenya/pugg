        RUGOFF--Milton, 93, author, editor, and book reviewer, with a Ph.D. from Columbia, died peacefully in Westchester on February 17. His most notable publication, among many books, is on the historically significant Beecher family of 19th century America. His brilliance, kindness, sense of humor, warmth, and charm will be deeply missed by his daughter, Kathy Rugoff and her husband of North Carolina, by his companion, Jennie Hoeber Allen and her sons, by his nieces, and by his friends. His beloved wife, Helen, died in 1992. A gathering celebrating his life will be held in the summer.
