        TAPLIN-Frank. The Institute for Advanced Study is profoundly grateful for the commitment of Frank E. Taplin Jr. to its mission of fostering advanced scholarship and postdoctoral education, and for his desire to be a part of the Institute community as our friend and Trustee for over thirty years. Frank's wide-ranging curiosity embraced science as well as the humanities, and he was fascinated by research advances at their very frontiers. A man who always led by example, Frank inspired support for the Institute's scholarly work and outreach programs, and provided art from his personal collection to grace our walls. An environmentalist who cared deeply for the Institute Woods and farm fields, Frank led the way to a partnership for the permanent preservation of almost 600 acres of Institute land. We were fortunate to have been counted among his friends, and deeply appreciate all that he did for the Institute, as well as his care and concern for each individual here. We will miss him greatly, and extend our deepest sympathy to Peggy and their family. Institute for Advanced Study
