        LIVERANT-Dina. We extend heartfelt condolences to Jacob Liverant on the loss of his beloved wife, Dina. To anyone who had the good fortune of knowing her, she was a source of happiness and joy. As Golden Founders of the ''Hospital with a Heart'' and supporters of the Jesselson Heart Center, their generosity has played a vital role in helping to provide comprehensive, state-of-the-art care to the people of Jerusalem. May Jacob, his son Alex, his daughter Dorothy, grandchildren Shoshana, Simona and Gabrielle, and the entire family have warm and loving memories of a very special, caring and righteous individual. May they be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
