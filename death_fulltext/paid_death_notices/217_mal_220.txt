        EHRLING--Sixten. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of the distinguished conductor Sixten Ehrling, who led 92 performances during his five seasons with our company. He introduced Bartok's ''Bluebeard's Castle'' to the Met repertory, and also led such diverse works as ''Peter Grimes,'' ''Simon Boccanegra,'' ''Il Trittico,'' ''Samson et Dalila,'' and Wagner's ''Ring'' cycle. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Gunnel Lindgren-Ehrling, and to his daughters. Joseph Volpe, General Mgr James Levine, Music Dir
