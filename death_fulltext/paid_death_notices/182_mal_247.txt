        DELLI-PIZZI-Louis J. The Morgagni Medical Society mourns the loss of former President Louis J. Delli-Pizzi and extends its sympathy to his wife Joan and his family. We also extend our sympathy to his sister Antonia E. DelliPizzi, M.D., his nephew Peter Sordillo, M.D. and to his niece Emilia Mia Sordillo, M.D., all three of whom are members of the society. Dr. Delli-Pizzi's wisdom, judgement and warmth will be missed by the society. Peter Sordillo, M.D., President The Morgagni Medical Society
