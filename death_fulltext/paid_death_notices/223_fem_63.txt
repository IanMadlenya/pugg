        ROBBINS--Megan. 28. Beloved daughter of Barbara Robbins (Phil), sister of Jacqueline, step-sister of Andrea Barna, step-daughter of Steven Barna, sister-in-law of Dennis Smith. Adoring, and adored aunt, to Julia and Fiona, cherished great-niece of Gertrude Goodmark. Beloved ''daughter'' of her ''comother'' and dear friend, Aida, and ''parent'' to the dogs she so treasured: Oscar, Scout, Jester and Molly. She is also survived by her loving father, David Greetham, and half-brother Alexander. A beautiful, talented and wonderfully caring soul, with a fierce loyalty to her many friends, great love of literature and language, and extraordinary compassion for those less fortunate than she. She left us far, far too soon but will be loved and remembered always.
