        SACHS-Alice. A force for Reform Democratic politics in New York City for nearly half a century, Alice Sachs was one of the founders of the Lexington Democratic Club. She became its first female District Leader in 1953, later served as its State Committeewoman and twice was its candidate for the State Assembly. More important, perhaps, than these and other accomplishments was Alice's unswerving commitment to honest, integrity and fair play. If anyone was a personification of the principles of the Reform Movement, it was Alice Sachs. We will miss her at the Lexington Club. And so will the body politic as a whole-in the city, the state, and the nation. Lexington Democratic Club
        SACHS-Alice. The members of Community Board 8 join in mourning the loss of Alice Sachs, a powerful and persuasive voice for the Upper East Side. As an officer and committee chair her commitment to the Board and the community in which she lived was very special. She will indeed be missed. Community Board 8
