        HEILIG-Morton L., on May 14, 1997, in California. Beloved husband of Marianne. Loving father of Leslie (Lebowitz), Gregory and Jeffrey. Loving father-in-law, adoring grandfather. Beloved brother of Gladys Wiesenthal and Joan Kahn, and adored uncle. A man of all seasons and many talents, Mort was a documentary film maker of note, a teacher, cinematographer, newsman, director and inventor. His seminal articles, publications & inventions in the field of Virtual Reality caused him to be called the ''Father of Virtual Reality.'' His inventive mind ran the gamut from lenses for the original wide screen theater to his Supercruiser line of scooters and all-terrain skateboards. His sweet spirit and elan will be sorely missed by all who knew him and whose life he touched. Services and interment will be private.
