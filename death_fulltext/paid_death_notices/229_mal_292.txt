        FERBER--Dr. Robert M. July 25, 1920--February 23, 2006. Beloved husband, father, grandpa, friend--He was a great conversationalist who took pleasure in being an independent thinker and superb craftsman. We miss him so much. ''He plays the violin. He tucks it right under his chin, and he bows.''
