        LAWRENCE-Elizabeth. Star of film, radio, stage and television, packed her backpack Friday, June 9 and started on a new adventure. Her films include ''Four Friends,'' ''The Crucible,'' ''Sleeping with the Enemy,'' ''The Butcher's Wife,'' ''Isn't She Wonderful?'', and an untitled film finished the day she died. Stage roles included ''Strange Interlude,'' with Glenda Jackson, ''Look Homeward, Angel'' with Anthony Perkins, and ''A Matter of Gravity'' with Katharine Hepburn. Early radio days brought her fame in soaps from which she transfered to television soaps and became famous playing ''Myra'' in ''All My Children'' for over five years. An expert in the field of autism, she saved hundreds of children from the darkness. Greenthumbed, she kept East 26th St. & Second Avenue a lush paradise. Environmentalist and lover of children she not only saved all the children, she saved all the trees in Murray Hill. If there were more than 30 hours to stay awake, one could understand how Liz could keep on such a path with growing and giving. She brought incredible hope to me dealing with my own struggle in the theatre and with my own struggle with the AIDS virus. I was not the only one she helped. Somehow she found the time to gather an armful of friends for coffee and compassion when the world seemed to be filled with too much pain. On Friday, Ms. Lawrence, who often said she had lived a glorious life, passed ''through the looking glass.'' I was fortunate that she loved my 60-year-old theatre stories, she helped me laugh. She can be seen on reruns every night of the week on television, and when you watch the way she works you may have some idea what ''civilized'' means. A memorial will be held the second week of July.
