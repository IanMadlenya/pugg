        LEET-Glen. All of us who have worked with the Trickle Up Program and have had the privilege of having known Glen Leet deeply mourn his death. Together with his wife Mildred Robbins Leet, he created and tested the wonderful poverty alleviation program that is Trickle Up. He guided and steered the program from ten businesses in 1979 to more than 68,000 in 1998. Glen delighted in the stories of the changed lives as a result of the Trickle Up process and pioneered the use of computers to track the businesses and their successes. Until the last weeks of his life, he worked hard to help the truly impoverished of our world. He looked to the day when the ranks of the pool would be lessened. Together with Mildred Robbins Leet, we, the staff he so carefully trained, encouraged and nurtured, are pledged to see to it that this day comes soon. A memorial service will be held Friday, May 15, 1998 at 12 Noon at the United Nations Church Center, 777 U.N. Plaza, (1st Ave and 44 Street) NYC. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be sent to the Trickle Up Program, 121 West 27 Street, NY, NY 10001. The Staff of the Trickle Up Program
