        KAHN - Shlomo. Congregation Beth Hillel and Beth Israel of Washington Heights deeply mourns the passing of its esteemed Rabbi, Shlomo Kahn. Rabbi Kahn, who was born in Stuttgart, Germany, was our spiritual leader for 47 years. His outstanding character, modesty and Torah knowledge were an inspiration to us all. Our heartfelt sympathy both to his wife Eva Kahn, his daughters, Rochel Furst, Yaffa Unger, and his sister Sophie Taub and their families. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. For the Executive Committee: William Blank Eric Hanau
