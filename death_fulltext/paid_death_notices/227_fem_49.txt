        HARRINGTON--Peggy, was a brilliant star in the life of the Interfaith Center of New York, from its beginning in January 1997 until her death last week. A woman of rich imagination and hard work, Peggy was an inspiration to board, staff, and program participants of all religious traditions, ethnicities, and ages--and of particular support to the Center's founder and president, Dean James Parks Morton, with whom she had also worked as Program Assistant at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine since 1991. A gifted writer and cultural critic of theater, art, and politics, plus a tireless worker for environmental sustainability and social justice, Peggy was deeply respected and loved and will be sorely missed by her many friends and the board and staff of the Interfaith Center of New York. Memorial Service Sunday, December 18th, 2:00 PM, St. Mary's Episcopal Church, 521 West 126th St. Contributions in her memory may be made to the Interfaith Center of New York, 20 East 79th St, NY, NY 10021.
