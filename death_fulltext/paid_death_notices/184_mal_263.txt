        WESTON-Rev. M. Moran, Ph.D. The Board of Directors, staff and consumers of Weston United Community Renewal, Inc. deeply mourn the passing of our Founder and Chairman Emeritus, The Reverend M. Moran Weston, Ph.D. A visionary who ministered to the physical as well as spiritual needs of the people of Harlem, he pioneered the provision of housing with supports for the mentally ill and homeless of the community. Under his leadership, Weston United built Bishop House at 39 West 128th Street in 1985, and added Weston House at 203 West 113th Street and the Center for Hope (TLC) at 2262 Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., Blvd. His understanding of the cultural and economic needs of the community, led to the creation of Gallery M. at 123 West 135th Street and Visionary Bookstore at 2262 Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., Blvd., and job-training centers Club United at 321 West 125th Street and Casita Unida at 320 East 105th Street. Weston United has moved its headquarters to 321 West 125th Street which also houses Community Focus for people with AIDS and a Blended Case Management program. Dr. Weston was always a source of wisdom, history and values, providing inspiration and leadership. ''Hold fast to dreams'' was his watch word. The world is diminished by his passing.
