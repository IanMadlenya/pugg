        HELPHAND-Lewis. We mourn the passing of our beloved partner Lewis Helphand. Lew was our hero and our truest gentleman. His life-saving exploits in the Pacific during W.W.II were indicative of his bravery and selflessness. He always put others ahead of himself, both in wartime and in the workplace. Lou was a man of great grace, bearing and dignity, who cared deeply about his family, his co-workers and his clients. He taught us that caring, sensitivity and manners were the hallmarks of a civilized society. Lou set so many good examples for us in the way he treated people. Lou brought sunshine to all our lives. We will miss him dearly. From Lou's extended family at work, we extend our heartfelt condolences to Dottie, the wife he adored, and the rest of his immediate family.
