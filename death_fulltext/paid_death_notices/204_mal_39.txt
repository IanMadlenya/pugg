        KLAR--Henry A., 87, of Tamarac, FL, passed away peacefully on December 29, 2003, with his family at his bedside. A Master Sergeant in WWII, this prominent New York real estate lawyer started a new home brokerage business called Klar Realty in 1947.

An avid golfer and card player, world traveler and cruise staffer, and commerciallysuccessful sculptor, his good counsel and many contributions touched thousands of lives. He is survived by his loving wife of 63 years, Gloria, his respectful sons Lester and Steven, an attorney and real estate developer, of New York, and Dr. Ronald Klar, of Washington, his daughter-inlaw Deborah and granddaughters Laura and Jennifer, and his brother Edward of Boca Raton, FL. A funeral service will be held on Monday, January 5, 2004, at 12:00 noon at Gutterman's, Jericho Turnpike, Woodbury. Interment will follow at the family plot at Mount Ararat Cemetery in Farmingdale.
