        GOEHNER-Fred. We are all so saddened by the sudden and unexpected loss of our good friend, Fred. A warm and caring husband who knew how to love Amy and make her laugh, a model dad who allowed his five year old son, Nate to grow and blossom, and a loving and nurturing father to his two month old son, Joey. We can hardly believe he's no longer with us but are comforted by the support of his many friends and family who are sharing the stories of Fred's life from his rock n roll days to his days at Hamilton College to his courtship of Amy to more recent life as an actor and dad. We miss him with all our hearts. For those who would like to help celebrate Fred's life, please join us on Sunday, June 20 at 10:15 AM at Riverside Memorial Chapel, Amsterdam Ave & 76 St.
