        GRINKER--Lois. Died peacefully on May 18, 2006. An exquisite and vibrant 70, this remarkable lady fought valiantly against cancer for 24 months, never giving an inch, bright and beautiful until the very end. Born in the Bronx in 1936, Lois went from Midwood High School to her beloved Barnard College. She played an important role in her husband Charlie Grinker's success in television. Lois was the love of his life as well as the demanding critic and diligent researcher behind his programs and series which were honored with two EMMY awards and a George Foster Peabody award. She was passionately devoted to Charlie, to her children: Andrew, Jonathan, and Peter Bergner; her daughters-inlaw: Amy, Diane and Stacey; her stepdaughter, Lori Grinker; her brother, Allen Frank and his wife Judy; and her cherished grandchildren: Aliza, Daniel, Erica, Kara, Max and Rachel Bergner. She shared with each of them her love of a good time, her impeccable good taste, classic sense of style, enthusiasm for the arts, and dedication to education. In return, they brought her great joy through their accomplishments in school, dance, music, ice skating, baseball and the high standards they maintain in every facet of their lives. Her devoted friends were with Lois to the end, remembering how special she made them feel, reminiscing about the sunny moments they shared. Lois also greatly appreciated the care and love given to her by Dr. James Harris and his staff. Her wish was to complete her life at home in the beautiful white - shuttered bedroom she designed, her ''cocoon'' she called it. With the help of the loving people of Hospice of Palm Beach County she was able to do this. Please make any donations in her memory to HPBC, 5300 East Avenue, West Palm Beach, FL. 33407. Services will occur on Friday, May 19 at 11:45AM at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street, NYC.
