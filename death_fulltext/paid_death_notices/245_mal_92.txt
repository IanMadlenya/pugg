        BROECKER--William, on June 4, 2007. It is with great sadness that the School of Visual Arts announces the death of a distinguished faculty member and dear friend, William Broecker. Born on November 21, 1932 in Detroit, he began teaching in the Photography Department at the School of Visual Arts in the fall of 1967. Over the years he offered his original courses, including Photo Techniques and The History of Photography, and mentored students in independent-study projects. In 2001 he received SVA's Distinguished Art Historian Award, and has also received honors from the Art Directors Club and the Society for Technical Communication. William was a highly regarded historian who applied his writing, editing and design talents to an array of books, magazines, encyclopedias and technical manuals in the fields of photography and magic. He died at his home in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, after an extended illness. Our condolences go to his wife Louise and brother Charles.
