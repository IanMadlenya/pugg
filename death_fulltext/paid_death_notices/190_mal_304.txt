        BRENNAN-Francis William. Born November 18, 1919, youngest child of William J. and B. Agnes Brennan, Frank graduated from Newark's West Side High in 1936, Princeton University in 1940, and Harvard Law in 1947. Predeceased by his wife, Betty, and his son, Kirk, Frank is survived by his daughter, Judi, his son, Bob, his grandchildren, Alycia and Stephen, and widespread friends. Mr. Brennan was a decorated hero from World War II and had a distinguished career in alcoholic beverage control law, spanning the nation from the Ballantine and Rheingold breweries to E. and J. Gallo winery. He was particularly proud of his public service, extending from Boys' Clubs to the Essex County Park Commission to the San Joaquin Grand Jury. With his lifelong dedication to helping others, he has chosen to donate his body to medical research. He leaves a legacy and a model of integrity, honesty, courage, and faith. In his memory please hug a child, plant a tree, and thank a public servant for all they gave and will give you, your family, and your community.
