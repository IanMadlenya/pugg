        COHEN-Donald, M.D. Our faculty and staff mourn the loss of Donald Cohen, M.D., compassionate clinician, generative teacher and a leader in child and adolescent psychiatry. Donald was a mentor to many of our field's leaders, and was one of the original advisers and supporters in establishing the New York University Child Study Center. We send our deepest sympathy and support to his loving wife Phyllis, children and grandchildren, and to his Yale Child Study Center family. Brooke Garber Neidich, Board Chairman Harold S. Koplewicz, M.D., Arnold and Debbie Simon Professor of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Director, Child Study Center New York University School of Medicine
