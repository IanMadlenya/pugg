        CLIMENKO-Jesse. The President of Montefiore and its Board of Trustees are deeply saddened by the death of Jesse Climenko, an esteemed benefactor and devoted friend of the medical center. A distinguished attorney unswervingly committed to helping preserve the research mission of the academic medical center, his roots to Montefiore reach back to the early years of the century when his father, Dr. Hyman Climenko, served as head of neurology. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his daughter, Jane Gottschalk, and his entire family. Spencer Foreman, M.D., President Jay B. Langner, Chairman Board of Trustees Montefiore Medical Center
