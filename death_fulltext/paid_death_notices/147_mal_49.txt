        HEUSTEIN-Hal. The Board of Directors of the Subcontractors Trade Association (STA) is deeply saddened by the passing of Hal Heustein, a dear friend and former member of the Board, on March 26, 1999. Hal, a known figure in the building industry, has been involved with New York City's construction business for over 30 years. Hal received the STA ''Subcontractor of the Year Award'' in 1996. He was founder and President of Woodworks Construction, Inc. He will surely be missed by his friends and associates. STA invites you to join at a memorial service in his honor on Tuesday, April 6, 1999, at 3 p.m. at Campbell's Funeral Home, Madison Avenue and 81 Street, NYC.
