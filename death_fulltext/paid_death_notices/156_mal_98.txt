        BRYSON-David Brady, 58, passed away peacefully Christmas morning with his family by his side. He is survived by his beloved wife Anita; son Paul, a freshman at Princeton; daughter Hallie, an attorney in San Francisco; and son Ethan, a medical student in New York City. They are eternally grateful for his guidance and support. He is also survived by parents Mary and Brady; sister Linda; and brothers John and Tim. Born August 16, 1941, he grew up in Westminster, Maryland. He graduated cum laude from Princeton University in 1963, and summa cum laude from Columbia University Law School in 1966. He clerked for California Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Traynor and taught law at the University of Ghana. The past 29 years he was committed to securing social justice for the poor through his work at the National Housing Law Project. He was honored with the California State Bar's prestigious 1999 Loren Miller Legal Services Award, and by the National Legal Aid and Defender Association, the National Low-income Housing Coalition, and the National Tenants Organization for his tireless efforts on behalf of those less fortunate. Never a smoker, his life was cut short by lung cancer. He fought the disease with the same dignity and integrity he exhibited throughout his life. At his request, donations may be made in his memory to the National Housing Law Project, 614 Grand Avenue, Suite 320, Oakland, CA 94610.
