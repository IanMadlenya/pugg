Don served AJC with distinction as president of our San Francisco Bay Area chapter and, as a longstanding member of our national Board of Governors. In 1987 we honored him with our Distinguished Service Award. Devoted to the law, the Jewish people and his community, Don contributed his considerable talents and humanity to each endeavor.
