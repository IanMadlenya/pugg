        CAPUTO--Kim Zorn. Her many friends in photography deeply mourn the passing of Kim Zorn Caputo, Founding Editor & Publisher of Blind Spot. Kim touched the lives of photographers, dealers, curators, and collectors with her elegant magazine. Our thoughts are with her family, son Matt, and long-time partner Robert Mann. Kim's eye and voice will continue to inspire us. As expressed in her last Blind Spot, ''We are everywhere forever.'' The Association of International Photography Art Dealers, Inc.
