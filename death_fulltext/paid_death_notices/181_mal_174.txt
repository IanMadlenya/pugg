        RATTI-Antonio. The trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art extend deepest sympathies to the family and associates of Antonio Ratti, who was a treasured friend and colleague over many years. He was most generous to the museum-as an honorary trustee and benefactor, and through his foundation, as the force behind the Antonio Ratti Textile Center, which will remain a lasting tribute to his landmark work in the textile field and to his memory. We will miss his extraordinary warmth and his sharing spirit. James R. Houghton, Chairman Philippe de Montebello, Director
