        WILSON--Josephine Strother. On September 20, in Dallas, TX, where she had lived in recent years. Born in South Carolina, in 1919, for much of her life a resident of New York, Mrs. Wilson was married first to Roblee McCarthy of St. Louis, MO, and later to R. Thornton Wilson Jr. of New York. Both marriages ended in divorce. She is survived, mourned and keenly missed by a daughter, Nancy Richardson of New York and Sag Harbor, former son-in-law Frank E. Richardson, a son, Roblee McCarthy Jr. and daughter-in-law Josie McCarthy of Dallas; and cherished grandchildren Philip, Carolina and Isabelle Richardson, Eugenie and Juliana McCarthy. Services will be held at a later date.
