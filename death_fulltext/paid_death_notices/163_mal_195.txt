His enthusiasm, intellect and love of life inspired all who knew him. He was Assistant Attending Urologist at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center and held private practice there for 36 years.

As Captain in U.S. Armed Forces, he headed a MASH unit in Germany from 1950 to 1952. In 1970, he volunteered at the Albert Schweitzer Hospital in Haiti.
