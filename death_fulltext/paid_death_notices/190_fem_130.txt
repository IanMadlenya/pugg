        ZAPHIROPOULOS - Augusta. November 5, 2002, age 89. Born in France, she graduated from The Sorbonne in 1939 and later completed her graduate degree in Education at Bank Street Teachers College. She joined the faculty of Sarah Lawrence College in 1964 and was made Professor Emerita in 1981. Articulate, interesting, direct, generous, and unique, she loved literature, art and nature, and contributed much to those whose lives she touched. We will always remember her and love her. She is survived by her daughter Lela, her son Leigh, her son-in-law Jan Van Assen, her daughter-in-law Bryn McCornack, and by many dear friends. A Memorial Service will be held in the Spring.
