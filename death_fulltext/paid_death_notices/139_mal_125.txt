        FONTRIER-Gabriel. The Aaron Copland School of Music at Queens College/CUNY deeply mourns the passing of its Professor Emeritus on August 5, 1998, and extends its deepest sympathy to his wife, May, and their four daughters. Prof. Fontrier joined the music faculty in 1947 after receiving degrees from Queens College and Columbia University. A student of Karol Rathaus, Fontrier taught courses in composition, theory and orchestration. He composed many orchestral, chamber and choral works and was the coauthor with his colleagues Sol Berkowitz and Leo Kraft of ''A New Approach to Sightsinging.'' Prof. Fontrier was also the music editor and critic for the Long Island Press in the 1960's and 70's. Contributions in his memory may be sent to the Aaron Copland School of Music, Queens College/ CUNY, Flushing, New York 11367.
