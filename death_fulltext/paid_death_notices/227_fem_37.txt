        RIESS--Anneliese, PHD. On December 1, 2005. Dr. Riess was indeed a remarkable woman. After leaving her native Germany, because of rising anti-semitism in the 1930's she continued her studies in Anthropology in Italy and earned her PHD. After coming to the United States and working as a baby nurse she became interested in Child Development and Psychology. She studied for her second PHD at NYU. She was adjunct professor at the Graduate Department of Psychology at CCNY for many years and was in private practice. She enriched the lives of many of her students, friends and patients with her warmth and wisdom. Her autobiography was published in Germany in 2000 on the occasion of her 90th birthday. She will be sorely missed by her immediate and extended family and by her many friends. Barbara and Dan Sugarman
