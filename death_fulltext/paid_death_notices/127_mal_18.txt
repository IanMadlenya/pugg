        LINCER-William. The Philharmonic-Symphony Society of New York, Inc. notes with sadness the death of William Lincer, Principal Violist of the Orchestra from 1943 to 1972. During a distinguished Philharmonic career, Mr. Lincer played more than 4,000 concerts, including 57 solo appearances. Most memorable among these was Strauss' ''Don Quixote'' on the occasion of Leonard Bernstein's November 14, 1943 conducting debut. Mr. Lincer's lifelong dedication to excellence, and his regard for his colleagues, his students, and his community, will long be a source of inspiration to us. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Mary, and to his sister, Mrs. Janet Bernstein. Kurt Masur, Music Director Members of the Orchestra Paul B. Guenther, Chairman Deborah Borda, Exec Director
