        GORDON-Harvey. With great sadness, the Board of Directors, Administration and Residents of the Gurwin Jewish Geriatric Center mourn the passing of Harvey Gordon, beloved husband of Rosalyn, a founding member of our Board of Directors. Rosalyn and Harvey were among those earliest donors whose vision helped bring Gurwin to the preeminent facility it is today. Harvey was a respected memeber of the Long Island business and philanthropic community. He will be missed. Our heartfelt condolences to the entire family. Joseph Gurwin, President Alfred W. Levy, Chairman of the Board Herbert H. Friedman, Executive Vice President
