        WESSON--Howard Sheldon. Of West Orange, NJ. Died on February 1st in New York City after a six-month battle with pancreatic cancer. Born and raised in the Bronx, he was among the first students to attend the Bronx High School of Science. After graduating high school, he entered the Army and trained operators in the pioneer expansion of coastal radar during the latter half of World War II. Following his discharge, he returned to New York to study Comparative Medieval Literature at New York University, Columbia and, later, at the Universite de Paris. He began his professional career as a medical advertising copywriter. In 1963, he formed his own medical advertising agency, Wesson & Warhaftig, which he directed for two decades. In the early '80s, he sold the agency to William Douglas McAdams and moved to develop a successful new career in the theater. He studied at the T. Schreiber Studio, and became an active member of Equity, SAG and AFTRA, performing in many off-Broadway, regional and stock productions, as well as on television shows such as Law and Order. His portrayal of Willy Loman in the 1992 William Carlos Williams Center production of ''Death of a Salesman'' was highly praised by the New York Times, StarLedger and Bergen Record. A generous and kindhearted raconteur, he will be lovingly remembered by his wife Micki, daughter Rebecca, sons Daniel and Joshua, and by all who knew him as a warm and giving man. A celebration of his life will take place in Manhattan on May 9. In lieu of flowers, contributions in his name can be made directly to the CP Nichols School Library, P.S. 42, 700 Newark Avenue, Jersey City, NJ 07306.
