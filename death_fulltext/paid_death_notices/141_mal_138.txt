        SANDLER-Joseph, M.D. It is with great sorrow and respect that we extend our condolences to the family and colleagues of Dr. Sandler, psychoanalytic scholar and former president of the International Psychoanalytic Association. He was a great friend, not only to psychoanalysis, but also to us as we made our way into membership in the IPA. Barbara Stimmel, Ph.D., Pres. New York Freudian Society
