        ARNOLD -- Ruth (nee Schwartz). Born December 26, 1921, in South Hampton, LI. Passed away at 84 years old on November 4, 2005, after a brief illness. Ruth is survived by her husband of 61 years, Joseph Arnold, of Manhattan, her son Richard of Los Angeles, CA, and daughter Deborah of Manhattan Beach, CA. Ruth grew up in what was then the tiny town of South Hampton, the daughter of Sarah and Alex with her sister Cele. She moved to Manhattan as a young woman joining her sister Helen, and she and Joe met at a USO dance in 1944 at Temple Emanu-El. They began married life in Brooklyn while Joe was serving in WW II. Upon return, they moved to Flushing, Queens, later moving to Brooklyn, where she and Joe raised their family. They moved to Manhattan in 1992, and Ruth loved the culture and museums that the Upper East Side afforded her, and the view of Central Park from her window. Ruth was a kind, gentle person who loved to paint, play tennis and bridge, and spend summers in East Hampton. She especially loved working with the Whitney Museum, travelling to schools in the NYC area helping young students develop an understanding and appreciation of fine art. Funeral services were held at Riverside Memorial Chapel on Sunday, November 6, 2005.
