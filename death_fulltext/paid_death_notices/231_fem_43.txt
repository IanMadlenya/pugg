        QUICK--Regina. A great woman who was loved by all who knew her. She was full of love and compassion for those in need, and was always generous, kind and ready to offer support in so many ways. Jean had a ready smile and a warm and loving way about her that made you feel special...even if she herself was in pain. What a great lady--in the fullest sense of the word--and a fine example for all the world to follow. We were privileged to know her & will miss her. Our deepest condolences & love to everyone in her family. Catherine and Fred
