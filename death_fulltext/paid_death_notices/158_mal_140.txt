        TERENZIO-Joseph V. The board of directors, other volunteers, and staff of the United Hospital Fund are deeply saddened by the loss of their former president. From 1972 to 1983, he provided strong and progressive leadership at a time of significant change in New York's health care system. A man with tremendous energy, he was a dedicated spokesperson on behalf of voluntary hospitals and their role in providing care to poor and uninsured New Yorkers, a champion of community health information systems to better understand New Yorkers' health status and needs, and a committed advocate for better health care for all New Yorkers. We extend our deep condolences to his children. Howard Smith, Chairman James R. Tallon, Jr., President
