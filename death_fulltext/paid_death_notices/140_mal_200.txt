        WEINSTEIN-Edwin, MD. The William Alanson White Psychoanalytic Insititute and Society note with profound sorrow the recent passing of one of their most acclaimed colleagues. Dr. Weinstein, a graduate of 50 years, was connected with White from its inception. A fine scholar, academician, diagnostician and clinician, Dr. Weinstein quickly rose to esteemed positions on the faculty, including those of training analyst, Fellow, and research chairman with a world-renowned expertise in neurological communication disorders. Despite the many demands by other organizations for his expertise, he continued to serve the Institute and Society in significant ways. Our condolences to his family and to his many friends and colleagues. Marylou Lionells, Ph.D., Dir. White Insititute Robert Watson, Ph.D., President White Society
