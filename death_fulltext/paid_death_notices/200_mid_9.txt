        APPLEBAUM--Rabbi Dr. David and Naava. ''She (Jerusalem) weeps bitterly in the night and her tear is on her cheek.'' Heartbroken and devastated, we mourn the tragic deaths of a treasured jewel of the Jewish people together with his beloved daughter Naava, both of whom died Al Kiddush Hashem, on the eve of her wedding. An extraordinary and humble man whose very being radiated kindness, dignity and modesty, his ability to synthesize the teachings of Torah and Medicine made him a living model of Torah Im Derech Eretz. Among his colleagues, students and friends, he was considered a ''great Torah scholar'', ''a sparkling personality'' and ''a model family man.'' As head of our Department of Emergency Medicine, his visionary thinking, expertise, impressive professional achievements and warm bedside manner, established him as one of the country's leaders in the field. Likewise, in her short life, Naava exhibited compassion, courage and deep commitment to the Jewish people through her national service work with children suffering from cancer. Our profound condolences to his wife Debra and their five children. May the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
