        RAINEY-Harry G., M.D. We note with sorrow the passing of one of our Founding Physicians, a highly revered family practitioner. His medical career spanned almost 50 years and represented the true spirit of patient care. This well-respected physician often served several generations of an entire family, treating all with compassion and expertise. He retired 15 years ago, remaining on our roster as a member of our Honorary Staff. Our sincerest condolences are extended to all his family. Lawrence Scherr, M.D., MACP Sr. V.P., Medical Affairs, Chairman Dept. of Medicine North Shore University Hospital
