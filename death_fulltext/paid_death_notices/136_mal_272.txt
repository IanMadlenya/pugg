        BASTEK-James V., M.D. It is with profound shock and sorrow that we mourn the untimely and tragic death of our esteemed colleague, Dr. James V. Bastek. A retinal associate with our ophthalmic practice for over ten years, we knew him to be a brilliant and caring physician. We also knew and respected his devotion to his closeknit family. His sudden death will leave a personal and professional void in the lives of many. Our sincerest sympathy to his wife, Carol, and his children, who all survived the tragedy. Marvin C. Kochman, M.D. Mark A. Lebowitz, M.D. Laurey G. Mogil, M.D. Brooklyn Eye Surgery Center and the entire Staff
