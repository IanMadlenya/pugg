        HINTON-Milt. The City University of New York mourns the passing of Milt Hinton, distinguished jazz bassist, who shared his craft with our students for more that two decades as an instructor at Hunter College and Baruch College. Mr. Hinton conducted the Jazz Workshop at Baruch College from 1976 until 1995 and was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Music in 1996 for his lifetime achievements. Our deepest sympathies to his wife, Mona, and his family. Herman Badillo, Chairman, Board of Trustees Matthew Goldstein, Chancellor
