        SMITHIES -- Dolores. The Board of Directors and staff of the International Rescue Committee are saddened by the death of Dolores Smithies, a valued member of our Board since 1969. Dolores was a tireless advocate and fundraiser for the cause of refugee relief and resettlement. She was especially devoted to assisting those who fled Cuba and came to the United States in search of freedom. We will miss Dolores deeply, and we extend our heartfelt sympathy to her family.
