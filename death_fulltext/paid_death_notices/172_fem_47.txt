        KALIK-Muriel. The Board of Directors, staff and members of the League For The Hard of Hearing mourn the passing of a dear friend and benefactor. Her concern, care and insight for the welfare of older adults with hearing loss helped us to respond in new and innovative ways to meet their needs. We express our sympathy to Murray, Elvira and Mark, and her entire family. John M. Scopaz, President
