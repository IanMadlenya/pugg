        SIEV--Rabbi Dr. Asher. On Sunday, January 22. Born in Jerusalem in 1913, he came to the United States at age 16, received smicha in 1937 and his doctorate in Hebrew Letters in 1939, both from Yeshiva University. Rabbi of Kehillath Israel in the Bronx for almost 30 years and esteemed Professor of Hebrew Language and Literature at Yeshiva University for 57 years, he authored numerous scholarly articles and books, including the definitive work on the REMA, which won the prestigious Rav Kook Prize. He was a delegate to the World Zionist Congress in 1949. His dear wife Priscilla, sons Moshe, Yoseph and David, surviving sisters Tzipora Wagreich, Shoshana Baylin, Dr. Esther Benenson and Josepha Schwartz, devoted daughters-in-law, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and extended family, mourn his passing, as do his many admiring friends and former students. Shiva through Monday morning January 30, 612 Maitland Ave., Teaneck.
