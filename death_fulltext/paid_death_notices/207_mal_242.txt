        MARTIN--C. Virgil. The Board and staff of the Mertz Gilmore Foundation note with sadness the passing of their friend, colleague, and mentor, Virgil Martin. His wisdom, integrity, and standard of responsible trusteeship helped set the course of the Foundation in its early years. His good cheer, encouragement, and counsel will be sorely missed.
