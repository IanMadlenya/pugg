        MENDLOWITZ--Milton, M.D. It is with profound sorrow that The Mount Sinai Alumni mourns the passing of Dr. Mendlowitz, a world recognized physician, scientist, academician and clinician, who served Mount Sinai and medicine for over 70 years. An international authority on the causes and treatment of hypertension and cardiovascular disease, he served as Chief of Mount Sinai's Hypertension Program from 1950 to 1975. He had profound influence on many generations of physicians and students as he patiently gave his time, intelligence and warmth. In 1965, The Mount Sinai Alumni presented its most coveted award, the Jacobi Medallion, to Dr. Mendlowitz in acknowledgment of his many contributions as a physician, researcher and teacher and the great distinction he brought to Mount Sinai. He will be missed. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his family. William G. Stein, M.D.--Pres. Barry D. Stimmel, M.D.--V.P. Betty Mintz, M.D.--Treas. Elliot Rayfield, M.D.--Sec'y
