        BERNSTEIN-Sylvia. Sylvia Bernstein, loving and devoted mother of Allen J. Bernstein and Helene Morrison, and adoring grandmother of Stacey Stolar, died on June 13th after a long illness. She was a woman whose nurturing love, encouragement, strength and compassion shaped and enriched the lives of her children and her granddaughter. She took enormous pride in their many achievements, and always gave them her love, wisdom and unflagging support. Her endearing personality, warmth, wit and sincerity were cherished by her extended family and her many friends. The great void in her life was the loss of the love of her life, her dear husband Morty, who was taken from her and his loving family in 1974. She was known for her gracious hospitality, her infectious optimism and the diversity of her activitieswhich ran the gamut from golf to mah jongg. She was a woman of uncommon kindness, great dignity and unqualified love. And she will be missed.
