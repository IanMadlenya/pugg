        RABER-Irving. The Board of Directors of the American Friends of David Yellin College of Education mourn the loss of Vice President Irving Raber, loving and devoted husband of Naomi, father of Patty and Michael and special mentor and friend to his grandchildren. Irving served for many years as treasurer of the American Friends of David Yellin College of Education and tirelessly worked as a committee member for all events. Irving was a vibrant Jewish leader who touched and enriched the lives of many. We extend our deepest sympathy to the entire Raber family. Elias Strum, President Marjorie G. Price, Executive Director The American Friends of David Yellin College of Education
