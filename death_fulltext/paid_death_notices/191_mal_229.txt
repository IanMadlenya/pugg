        IBERALL-Arthur Saul, the physicist who developed Homeokinetics, died on December 8 in Laguna Woods, CA. Trained at CCNY and GWU, Iberall was an ASME Fellow, a BEW Distinguished Lecturer, a NYAS Member, and recipient of an OSU honorary DS. He contributed significantly to the development of the first space suit and the high speed dental drill. His work on high altitude instrumentation at National Bureau Standards helped the USA WW II effort. After a distinguished career in government consulting and private industry, Iberall was invited to UCLA to pursue the development of homeokinetics. Normal physics, like nuclear physics, deals with processes at single levels, but homeokinetics applies thermodynamics to systems dealing with life, mind, and societies. Iberall published over 200 papers and books, on the flow of information through disparate systems. At the University of Connecticut 1998 Homeokinetics Conference, scientists reported how homeokinetics explains complex systems behavior, in contrast to chaotic theory that has no physical basis. Iberall will be remembered as a friend and mentor to scientists in a range of fields. He is survived by his wife Helene, his daughters, grandchildren and greatgrandchildren.
