        MONTENAY-Marie-Helene, founder and Director of the Gallery Montenay Giroux in Paris, died on December 6 after a long, courageous battle with cancer. She leaves behind her loving husband Philippe, her adoring nieces, Cecile Philipp and Isabelle Benestant, her brother, Jean Fremigacci, and five grandnieces and nephews, as well as a host of devoted friends. She will be sorely missed. A mass in her memory will be celebrated in Paris on December 20, at 6PM, L'Eglise Saint Julien Le Pauvre (rue Galande Paris 5eme).
