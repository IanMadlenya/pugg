        BURKE-Rev. Edward J. C.M. The St. John's University Board of Trustees, together with the entire University community, notes with profound sorrow the passing of Rev. Edward J. Burke, C.M., thirteenth president of St. John's University. Under Father Burke's leadership, from 1961-65, St. John's initiated major building projects on the Queens campus that help transform the site into the major metropolitan university that it is today. Diligent administrator, dedicated scholar and ardent teacher, he was a great friend of St. John's and of Catholic higher education. His gentleness and concern for others are his legacy to the University. We join with the members of his family in their sorrow, and with them we celebrate his life. Donald J. Harrington, C.M., President
