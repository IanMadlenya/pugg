He co-authored with NYU Professor James Tracy Crown, ''Kennedy in Power,'' (1961) the first revisionist history of the Kennedy Administration. John MacGregor Burns, the historian and noted biographer of President Kennedy, said '' . . such responsible criticism is badly needed. The authors of this book deserve a tour of duty at the White House.'' He was an activist in the civil rights and labor movements in the South in the 1940's at great risk to his life. He edited The Long Shadow of Little Rock by Daisy Bates, (1962). In the 1970's he was the editor-inchief at Belmont/Tower Publications, an original paperback house. He is survived by his wife, Edith, who adored and treasured this man. A memorial service will be announced.
