        COLBERT-Ann. Died peacefully on February 25, 2001 after a full life, leaving a legacy which she, as a founder of Colbert Artists Management, established with her late husband Henry Colbert. Her trail blazing, innovations and idealism in the service of classical music of the highest order set an example which we have followed and continued after her retirement in 1991. We are grateful for her guidance in years past and extend our deep sympathy to her family, her daughter Vera Chimene, her grandchildren and great grandchildren. Agnes Eisenberger, President And the Staff of Colbert Artist's Management Inc.
