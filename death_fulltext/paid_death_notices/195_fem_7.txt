        KURTZ-Ida. The American Friends of The Hebrew University and The Hebrew University of Jerusalem note with profound sorrow the passing of Ida Kurtz, beloved mother of Michael and Robert Kurtz; mother-in-law of Carol; and grandmother of Jason and Randy. An esteemed Guardian, Ida was known and admired for her long standing dedication to the Hebrew University and the people of Israel. Among Mrs. Kurtz's humanitarian contributions was her support for pioneering cancer research through the Michael and Carol Kurtz Endowment Fund in support of the Lautenberg Center for General and Tumor Immunology. Ida Kurtz's commitment lives on in the dedicated leadership of Michael Kurtz, national treasurer of American Friends and a member of Hebrew University's Board of Governors. We extend our deepest condolences to the entire Kurtz family who request that contributions in memory of Ida Kurtz should be made to American Friends of The Hebrew University in support of the Lautenberg Center.
