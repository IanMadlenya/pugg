        GREEN--Bernard R. The partners and staff of Friedman Alpren & Green LLP are saddened by the loss of Bernard R. Green, one of our founding partners. His leadership, integrity, eternal optimism and forward thinking gave our firm a strong foundation. He was a mentor to many of us, encouraged our efforts and unselfishly shared his experiences. His long-standing relationships with clients and friends of the firm is a testimony to his ongoing personal involvement and concern for our continued success. We will sorely miss his wisdom, his vision, his humor and his love and dedication to the firm. Our sympathy to his wife Barbara and children Shirley and Bob Dembner and Andrea and Andrew Koslov and their families. >>AD#
