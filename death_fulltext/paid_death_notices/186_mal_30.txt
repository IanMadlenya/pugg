        OSHRY-Harold. The officers, Board of Directors and staff of UJA-Federation of New York are deeply saddened by the passing of Harold Oshry, a cherished friend, major supporter, and founding leader of Long Island's South Shore Division. Harold was a member of UJA-Federation's Council of Overseers and was a past vice chair of United Jewish Appeal. An active supporter of many Jewish institutions in New York, Florida, nationally, and in Israel, he was a major force in the movement to help Soviet Jews immigrate to Israel in the 1970s and early 80s. Harold left a legacy of hope for thousands who have been touched by his extraordinary generosity, commitment to humanitarian causes, and passion for Israel and the Jewish people. He embraced the philanthropic traditions of ''tikkun olam'' and instilled these values in his children and grandchildren. His son, Michael, is a major supporter and current leader in the South Shore Division along with his wife, Pamela. We extend our deepest sympathies to Harold's wife, Claire, to Michael and Pamela and their children, & to Michael's sisters, Meryl & Suzanne, and their families. Harold's contributions to the worldwide Jewish community will be felt for generations to come and his memory will be honored by the continued caring and generosity of his family. Larry Zicklin, President Morris W. Offit, Board Chair Erika Witover, LI Steering Committee Chair John S. Ruskay, Exec VP & CEO Stuart Tauber, LI Regional Director
