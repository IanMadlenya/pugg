        CARROLL - ABBING - Monsignor John Patrick. The directors and staff of Boys' Towns of Italy, Inc. mourn the passing of our beloved founder, Monsignor John Patrick Carroll-Abbing. He was ordained a priest in Rome in 1935 and named a Monsignor shortly thereafter. He served in the Papal Household under Pope Pius XI and Pope Pius the XII until the outbreak of World War II. Pope Pius XII gave Monsignor permission to leave the Household and to assist the refugee population of Italy. He began by starting ''Shoeshine Hotels'' for the young street population of Italy and thereafter devoted his life to caring for children whose lives have been shattered by war, poverty, and natural disaster. His mission of unconditional love and acceptance have stood for decades as a shining beacon offering a ''second chance in life'' to lost and abandoned boys and girls of many nationalities. Monsignor Carroll-Abbing was the founder and leader of the residential facilities Boys' Towns of Rome and Girls' Towns of Rome, as well as Boys Towns of Italy, Inc., the oldest American charity working abroad, and was an internationally respected advocate for child welfare. We miss him dearly and will always strive to keep his spirit and mission alive. Brother A.E. D'Adamo, CFC, Executive Vice President Mauro C. Romita, Secretary/Treasurer
