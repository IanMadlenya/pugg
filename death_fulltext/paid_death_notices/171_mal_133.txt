        CANTOR-Arthur. ''Every Artist writes his own autobiography'', contends Havelock Ellis. And ''Master of the Theatre'', Arthur Cantor authored an extraordinary volume. Interestingly, Edith Wharton's Pulitzer Prize-winning ''The Age of Innocence'' appeared in 1920, his birth year; while Eugene O'Neill's ''Days Without End'' captured the imagination of the young Boston Latin School Freshman in 1934 at the home of 4 Signers of the Declaration of Independence marked its tricentennial. And as he received his diploma in 1938, he found himself caught-up in the aura of Thornton Wilder's ''Our Town''. His keen mind and thirst for avenues for uplifting the human spirit led him to Harvard that year. His rare gifts as The Artist Extraordinaire of the Theatre brought him to Broadway and to London where he enriched all of our lives with scores of theatrical wonders touching mostly on life's conundra. This was his special passion. But companion to that passion was his unabashed devotion to the young people of this Town scarred by family breakdown and drug addiction. Over three decades as Governor of Daytop Village, he kept their hopes alive as they took center stage in his concerns. To his beloved David and Jacqueline, we offer prayerful support. (Msgr.)
