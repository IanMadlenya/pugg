        ITZKOFF-Nathan (Nat). December 16, 1902-June 16, 1985. Admirable, brave, beloved Dad, on his 100th birthday. ''Tell me not, in mournful numbers,/Life is but an empty dream!-/For the soul is dead that slumbers,/And things are not what they seem./Lives of great men all remind us/We can make our lives sublime,/And departing, leave behind us/Footprints on the sands of time.''
