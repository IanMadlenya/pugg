        RANSOHOFF-Joseph, MD. The Trustees, Faculty and Staff of NYU School of Medicine mourn the passing of Joseph Ransohoff, MD, Professor and Chairman of the Department of Neurosurgery and Director of The Neurological Service at NYU Medical Center and Bellevue Hospital from 1961 to 1992. Dr. Ransohoff's distinguished career spanned more than 50 years. After receiving his BS at Harvard University in 1938 he earned his medical degree at the University of Chicago Medical School, completed residencies at Cincinnati General and Montefiore Hospitals, and was a neurological surgeon with the U.S. Army during the Second World War. Soon after joining the NYU faculty, he established the world's first neurosurgery ICU at Bellevue and trained more than 60 neurosurgeons, many of whom advanced to positions of leadership at medical schools all over the country. An avid fisherman, boater and jogger, Dr. Ransohoff moved to Tampa, Florida in 1992, but never truly retired. Since then, he served as Professor of Neurosurgery and Neurology at the University of South Florida School of Medicine and Director of Neurological Surgery at The Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Hospital. The entire Medical Center community extends its most heartfelt sympathy to Dr. Ransohoff's widow, children and grandchildren. Robert M. Glickman, MD, Dean NYU School of Medicine Theresa A. Bischoff, President, NYU Hospitals Center Patrick J. Kelly, MD, Chairman, Department of Neurosurgery
