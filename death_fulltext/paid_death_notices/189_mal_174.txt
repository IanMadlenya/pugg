        TUCK-Edward. North Country School and Camp Treetops would like to express their deep sorrow at the loss of Edward Tuck. Ed was on the Board of Trustees from 1975 thru 1986, serving as Board Chair from 1978-1986. We thank Ed for his many years of support and service to NCS and CTT, and extend our thoughts and prayers to his family at this time.
