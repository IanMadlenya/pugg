        DOLNY-LIPSY--Denyse. It is with profound sadness that the Heschel School community mourns the untimely passing of Denyse, wife of Mark Lipsy, mother of Talia and our student Boaz, after a valiant struggle with her illness. May this brave, vibrant, sensitive, caring woman rest in peace. Our hearts go out to the entire Dolny-Lipsy family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Alisa R. Doctoroff President Roanna Shorofsky Head of School
