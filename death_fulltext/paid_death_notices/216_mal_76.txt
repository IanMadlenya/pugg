        McCARTY -- Maclyn. The Rockefeller University community mourns with deep sadness the loss of our beloved colleague and friend, Maclyn McCarty, an eminent physician - scientist who served the university with enormous distinction for sixtythree years. A member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Medicine, and recipient of the 1994 Albert Lasker Award for Special Achievement in Medical Science, Dr. McCarty was a microbiologist best known for his seminal contributions to DNA research. In the 1940's, in association with Oswald Avery and Colin MacLeod, Dr. McCarty determined that genes are made of DNA, a landmark discovery that opened the gateway to the modern era of molecular biology and molecular medicine. From 1946 to 1981, as head of the Laboratory of Bacteriology and Immunology, he pioneered investigations of streptococcal infections and their complications including rheumatic fever. In 1960, he accepted appointment as physician-in-chief of The Rockefeller Hospital and for fourteen years fostered clinical research and clinical care on our campus. From 1965 to 1978, he also served the university as vice president. Dr. McCarty held one of the university's John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Professorships. Throughout his distinguished career, he was a forceful and articulate spokesperson for the importance of patient-based research and the need for medically trained investigators in biomedical inquiry. With uncommon insight and dedication, he was an exemplary model for many generations of investigators. His greatness as a scientist was matched by a wonderful humanity. A warm, wise and caring friend to many, he will be profoundly missed. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his beloved Marj, a cherished member of our community, and to his sons and daughter.
