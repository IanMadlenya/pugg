        BUCKLER-Phyllis, a member of Temple Emanuel for 42 years, and devoted helpmate, mother, grandmother, sister, aunt, loved one and friend ''who shed round her in the common strife and mild concerns of life, a constant influence, a peculiar grace.'' Bright, enthusiastic and caring, she took an interest in everything and in everyone, somehow knowing the truth about situations and people. She was a take-charge person, who helped anyone who needed help. There was no sham or pretense about Phyllis; she spoke her mind with informed, honest conviction. Meticulous in all that she did, with a special eye to detail, she, yet, had the capacity to transcend little things and pay attention to the important. She served the synagogue with distinction for so many years, particularly as a member of the committee that programmed for its Academy For Jewish Studies. She will be sorely missed by all of us. May her memory be for a benediction. Service at Temple Emanuel today at 12 Noon. Helaine Kushner, Director, Academy For Jewish Studies Dr. Robert S. Widom, Rabbi, Temple Emanuel of Great Neck Lloyd Goldfarb, Sandor C. Schweiger, Co-Presidents, Temple Emanuel
