        SALZER-Hedwig. The Mannes College of Music faculty, staff, and Board of Governors mourn the passing of Hedwig Salzer, a longterm and devoted benefactor and member of the Board and the widow of Felix Salzer, a famed music theorist, former Director of Mannes, and founder of the present Mannes curriculum. After his death, she carried on her husband's mission of supporting excellence in musical studies. Her wit, her charm, and her love for Mannes remained vibrant to her final days.
