        SPIEGEL -- Abraham. The American Friends of Beth Hatefutsoth and the Museum in Tel Aviv mourn the passing of our past president, a great man and benefactor of countless Jewish causes. An extraordinary individual who came out of the ashes of the Holocaust to contribute so much to Jewish memory and continuity. The Edita and Abraham Spiegel Wing of Beth Hatefutsoth is an everlasting monument to him and all the human values he promoted. Our most heartfelt condolences to our dear Rita, and her children, to Tom, and the entire extended family. May his memory be for a blessing to all who knew and admired him. Edgar Bronfman, Hon Chair Harvey M. Krueger, Pres Sam E. Bloch, Chairman Gloria Golan, Director
