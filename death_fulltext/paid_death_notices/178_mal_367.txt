        TREUHAFT-Robert E. Died at his daughter's house in New York on November 11, 2001, after a brief illness. Bob lived in the Bay Area, California, since he married the late Jessica Mitford in 1943. He formed several radical law firms in San Francisco and Oakland, representing labor unions, victims of police brutality, the Free Speech Movement, and working people seeking workers' compensation. During the McCarthy period, Bob was named ''one of the 10 most dangerous Communist lawyers in Northern California.'' Bob assisted his wife in the research and writing of ''The American Way of Death,'' in 1963, and finished ''The American Way of Death Revisited'' after Jessica Mitford's death in 1996. He is survived by his son Benjamin, daughter Constancia Romilly and son-in-law Terry Weber of Manhattan, sister Edith Lourie McKelvey of Los Angeles, grandsons James Lumumba Forman of Washington, DC, Chaka Esmond Forman of Hollywood, CA, and Ben Weber of Hanoi, Vietnam, as well as numerous friends on both coasts and abroad. Neighbors on Regent Street in Oakland have been leaving flowers on the porch. A memorial service is planned for February 23, 2002, in the Bay Area. Contributions (taxdeductible) may be made to Send a Piana to Havana, 39 E. 7th Street, New York, NY 10003.
