        HOROWITZ--Raymond J. 89. On September 18, 2005. Beloved by his daughter Judy Babcock and his late wife Margaret, and loving brother of Edith King. His career as a an attorney was punctuated by decades of wise counsel and thoughtful action. A pioneer art collector who promoted and appreciated scholarship in the field of American Impressionism, and along with Margaret, formulated a premiere collection. A caring friend, always ready with a willing ear. There will be a memorial occasion to be announced at a later date.
        $(6$)HOROWITZ--Raymond. The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn the loss of Raymond Horowitz, generous benefactor and friend for the past 30 years. His love of American art--particularly American Impressionism--led to his active involvement in the Museum's American Wing, as Chairman of the American Painting and Sculpture Visiting Committee since 1978 and as a William Cullen Bryant Fellow since 1982. With his wife Margaret, who passed away earlier this year, he donated paintings and funds to the American Wing, where two galleries will bear their names. Their passion for art and their gifts to this Museum will inspire curators, scholars, and the public alike into the future. We extend condolences to their entire family. James R. Houghton, Chairman Philippe de Montebello, Director Emily K. Rafferty, President Morrison H. Heckscher, Lawrence A. Fleischman Chairman, American Wing
