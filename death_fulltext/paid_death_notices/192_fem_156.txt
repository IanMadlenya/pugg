        STEIN-Ceil. A woman of commitment, initiative, integrity. I shall miss her Riverdale Press recipes & warmth of her glowing smile. Condolences to the Stein family. Joyce Liskin
        STEIN-Celia. It is with heavy hearts and much sadness that the Board of Directors and staff of Riverdale Neighborhood House express their deepest sympathies to the Stein family for the loss of their mother, mother-in-law, grandmother and greatgrandmother. Ceil Stein (Mrs. David A. as she would prefer) will be remembered not only for her endless devotion to her family and late husband, David, but for the extraordinary contributions she made, along with her family, to community institutions, too numerous to mention. Her involvement at Riverdale Neighborhood House dates back to 1950 when she assisted David in publishing our first newsletter, Neighborhood News, later to become The Riverdale Press. In 1980, both she and David received the RNH Good Neighbor Award for their long-standing commitment and dedication to Riverdale. Until two years ago, Mrs. Stein presented the ''David A. Stein Teen of the Year'' award, begun in the early '90s to an exemplary community teenager at our Annual Meeting, always beginning her presentation with a short biography of her beloved David. Mrs. Stein will be sorely missed by all who knew her or were touched by her kindness.
