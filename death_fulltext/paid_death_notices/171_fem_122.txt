        CIRILLO-Edith Arabella. Peacefully on Palm Sunday in her eighty-third year following a full and fullfilling life, leaving her children Diana, Joan and Richard, daughter-in-law Kathleen and grandchildren Amanda, Ted and Ben whom she loved and by whom she was equally loved. Wife of Paul Cirillo, daughter of John and Arabella Flanagan, sister of Alfred, Edward, Esther, Edwin and John Flanagan, and in-law of Henri and Aunt of Henry Vernier, all gone before her. A lifelong New Yorker, she held and met high goals, devoted herself to her family, contributed her time and energy to many worthwhile organizations, took pleasure in her reading, writing and studies, and pursued her travels widely. A wonderful woman of unparalled generosity, loyalty, sagacity and tenacity, her passing saddens the many who knew her, whether over the course of her lifetime or briefly in her last, declining years. A Wake will be held at the Mary Manning Walsh Home, 1339 York Avenue, NYC at 10:30 AM on April 16th, with services at 11 AM in the Chapel.
