        SPRINGARN-Clifford L, M.D. Internal Medicine Associates, the primary care faculty of the Mount Sinai Medical Center, School of Medicine, mourn the loss of this clinician, scholar, benefactor and humanist, a legend in his own lifetime. Beloved by patients, respected by colleagues, supported by his wife, Eleanor, this distinguished mentor has left an indelible mark on the promotion of primary care at Mount Sinai. The endowed Professorship in Medicine (primary care) will be a befitting celebration of his life, in perpetuity. Tariq Malik M.D., M.P.H.
