        RUDOLPH-Paul. The American Institute of Architects, New York Chapter, mourns the death of Paul Rudolph, FAIA. He was an enthusiastic colleague, rigorous mentor, and impassioned designer. He was devoted to the possibilities of modern architecture. His drawings and buildings, compositions of space, light and structure, enriched us all.
