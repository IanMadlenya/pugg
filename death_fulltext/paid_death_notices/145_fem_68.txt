        INDRANI-The Juilliard School notes with sadness of the loss of its long-time faculty member, dancer, teacher and historian, Indrani. A passionate and playful advocate for her native arts, and an exquisite artist on the stage, Indrani brought to life varied dance forms for a generation of students at Juilliard. Her contribution to our knowledge as citizens and artists of the world is incalculable. She shall be missed by our dancers and by us all. Joseph W. Polisi, President Benjamin Harkarvy, Director of The Dance Division The Juilliard School
