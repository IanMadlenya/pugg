        TIFFEN--Richard Marc, 51. Educator, IT Director, Naturalist of Norwalk, CT, following a 15 month battle with brain cancer on Wednesday, May 30, 2007. His career reflected his wide interests in technology, science and education. Most recently, Director of Information Technology in Wilton and Hamden B.O.E., he also taught earth science/biology at Townsend Harris High School and had a special gift for integrating technology and education. His passions included nature, birding, yoga and music. He obtained a B.S. from SUNY at Binghamton and an M.S. from Queens College. He is survived by his life partner, Micki, sons Ross and Jesse and sisters Susan Tiffen and Isabel (Marty) Kellerman and many nieces/nephews. Known for his sharp wit, skill as a chef, and his sensitive nature he will be sorely missed but not forgotten because ''love never disappears for death is a nonevent.'' In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to ''Tomorrow's Scholar'' F.B.O. Tiffen; care of Marjorie Morresi, Ameriprise Financial Advisers, 2 Corporate Dr -238 Shelton, CT 06484.
