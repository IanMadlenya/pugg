        $(6$)MURAVCHIK--Emanuel. The Forward Association mourns the passing of Manny Muravchik, our good friend and colleague for many decades. His was a strong, articulate, consistent voice of advocacy for social and economic justice, and for the principles of democratic socialism. His wise, clear-headed counsel, delivered with a calm dignity at all times, will be sorely missed. We offer our deepest sympathies to his wife Miriam and to his family. Dr. Barnett Zumoff, President Samuel Norich, Executive Director
