        ZAPHIRIS-Dr. Phyllis Wilens, on April 10, 1997. Beloved wife of Peter. She was a special person and will be profoundly missed by her family, her friends and colleagues. We will cherish her memory forever. A well-loved teacher and administrator in the Glen Cove school district for many years. A scholarship fund has been established there in her honor.
        ZAPHIRIS-Phyllis Wilens. You left us too soon. We will miss you beyond description. Your physical as well as mental beauty, your generosity and your ability to love will never be recaptured. Janie, Eddie and Adam
