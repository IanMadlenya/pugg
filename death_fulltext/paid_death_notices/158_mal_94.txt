        SNOW-Richard B. A NYC architect whose career span six decades died February 21, 2000 at the home of his stepdaughter. He was 94. Born in California, he graduated from Columbia College, and from the Columbia School of Architecture in 1931. In 1939 he recruited the architects Edward Stone and Morris Ketchum to work with him on a competition sponsored by the New York World's Fair. Their entry won, and Mr. Snow was commissioned to design a monumental emblem for the Focal Food Pavillon (the result, four 100 foot high steel wheatstalks, also later spent a quarter century in front of Steeple Chase Amusement Park in Coney Island). In 1942, Mr. Snow entered the Navy as a Lieutenant. He served in the Atlantic aboard a destroyer escort and took part in the action that sank the U-546. At war's end, he joined the staff of O'Connor and Kilham, working mainly on university and public buildings, among them the Barnard College library and the Firestone Library in Princeton. Mr. Snow married Emma Folger of Bronxville, N.Y. and after her death in 1976, married Martha Love McCagg, an architecture school classmate. He is survived by his son, Richard, the editor of ''American Heritage'' Magazine, his step-children Dr. Caroline McCagg-Kelly of Plainfield, N.J. and Edward McCagg of Seattle, WA., and two grandchildren.
