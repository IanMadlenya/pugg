        SILVER-Julius. The NYU community mourns the death of its illustrious and admired son, Julius Silver. A 1922 Phi Beta Kappa graduate and a long-serving and dedicated Trustee of the University, he was a generous supporter of NYU and its programs. He was a visionary businessman and respected attorney; Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors of the Polaroid Corporation, and officer of the Polaroid Corporation, and a founding partner of a New York law firm. He was also renowned as a philanthropist, and he supported education both in the US and abroad. He was devoted to his late wife, Roslyn Schiff Silver, and his late daughter, Enid Silver Winslow, and all who knew him recognized his love for his family. The world will be a poorer place for his absence, and he will be greatly missed by his many friends and admirers, and especially missed by the NYU family. L. Jay Oliva, President Martin Lipton, Chairman Board of Trustees
