        WHITE-Bernard. The American Zionist Movement mourns the passing of Bernard White. He served the Jewish community with distinction for over 50 years. He was a lifelong Zionist and served as a past National Treasurer of the AZM and a recipient of our Lifetime Achievement Award in 1999. Our deepest condolences are extended to his wife, Ruth.
