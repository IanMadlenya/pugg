        RUST-Irving. NARAL/NY, its Board, staff and members say farewell to our beloved Board member, friend and champion of our movement. His role as a physician for choice is legendary, especially his lifelong fight for the rights of poor women to obtain abortions and reproductive healthcare. We send our heartfelt sympathy to his wonderful family on their untimely loss.
