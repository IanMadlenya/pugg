        MANDELBAUM-Dr. Joseph. The Board of Trustees and their families and the staff of the League Treatment Center mourn the passing of Dr. Joseph Mandelbaum. Joe and his devoted wife Heddy founded the League Treatment Center. They devoted their energies to creating treatment and education for seriously mentally handicapped children. Our sympathy goes out to his children, his daughter Jill and sons Paul and Joel, and his many friends.
