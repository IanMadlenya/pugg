        TAYLOR--Ellen M. Died at her home in Port St. Lucie, FL, on April 14, 2005. Born in Pittsburgh, on August 22, 1928, she was a graduate of the University of Pittsburgh and a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma. She was a flight attendant for Capital Airlines during the glamour age of air travel. In recent years she lived in Manhattan, and was a docent at the JP Morgan Library, a position she loved because of her lifelong passion for art and literature. She is survived by her husband of 54 years, Roger, her children Mark, of Los Angeles, Noel of NYC, James of Satellite Beach, FL, and her grandchildren Gabrielle and Sean. Joining in grieving her death are her daughters-in-law Mary Lynn and Marissa, and son-in-law Michael Whitlow. All who knew her will remember her for her beauty, grace, dignity, kindness and humor, qualities which she maintained even in the face of fatal illness. Gifts in her memory may be made to the Lustgarten Foundation for Pancreatic Cancer Research, 111 Stewart Ave, Bethpage, NY 11714.
