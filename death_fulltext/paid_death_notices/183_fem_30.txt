        CORNING-Ursula. The Trustees and staff of The Nature Conservancy wish to express their deep sorrow at her passing and convey our sympathies to her family and friends. As a dedicated conservationist, Miss Corning's generosity for nearly two decades helped to preserve the countless plants, animals and natural communities that reside within the Conservancy's Last Great Places, in New York, on Long Island, and around the world. Her visits to the preserves she helped to support will be missed but not forgotten, especially at the Mashomack Preserve on Shelter Island.
