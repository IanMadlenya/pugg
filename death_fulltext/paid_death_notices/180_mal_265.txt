The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) deeply mourn the loss of Julius Silver, a distinguished and colorful attorney, devoted philanthropist and seminal figure in the ATS/Technion partnership. By founding the Technion's Julius Silver Institute of Bio-Medical Engineering in 1970which he continued to support along with his late wife RoslynDr. Silver helped establish the Technion as an international leader in this pioneering field. A Technion Guardian who reached the highest level of commitment to the ATS, the Technion and Israel, Dr. Silver was an Honorary Life Member of the Technion International Board of Governors and a Life Trustee of the ATS Board of Regents. He was honored with a Doctorate of Science in Technology from the Technion in 1971 and the ATS' prestigious Albert Einstein Award in 1989. A centenarian, Dr. Silver survived his beloved daughter Enid Winslow. He will be sorely missed by his ATS/Technion family.
