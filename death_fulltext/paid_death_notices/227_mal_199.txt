Dr. Johnson, born in Gibraltar, came to this greatcountry on March 4, 1950. Dr. Johnson earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree in Economics from New York University and an M.B.A. in International Finance and Economic Theory as well as a B.A. in Accountancy. He served as Professor of Economics and Finance for more than twenty years at Long Island University during which time he was, for more than a decade, the Dean of the Graduate and Undergraduate schools. He held the lifelong position of Emeritus Professor of Economics and Finance. Beyond his academic career, Dr. Johnson was President and Chief Executive Officer of a medical imaging corporation as well as a nuclear facilities corportation. In addition, over the years he has served as Consultant to the U.S. Treasury, major banks, corporations and universities in the U.S. and has served as member of the board and trustee of several not-for-profit institutions and civic organizations. He has received numerous awards for his civic contributions. Dr. Johnson is survived by his loving wife of many years, Madelyn Antoncic, his two children, Valerie and Matthew, and his grandson Gavin. He has selflessly enriched the lives of countless individuals, has taught many how to live and love life and will be greatly missed. In lieu of flowers, the family wishes he would be remembered through donations to the Weill Cornell Medical College Lung Cancer Research Institute which he was instrumental in helping establish this past year. A memorial service celebrating his life will be announced at a later date.
