        TAMARKIN-Norman R., M.D. Age 60. A prominent Washington, DC, psychiatrist and national expert on political psychology died suddenly while battling a long illness. Born in Youngstown, OH, Dr. Tamarkin graduated from Ohio State Medical School. After completing psychiatric training at Illinois State Psychiatric Institute in 1968, he came to the Washington area to do research at the National Institute of Mental Health. He ran the drug addiction program at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Washington after which he entered private practice. Dr. Tamarkin was also on the faculty of the Department of Psychiatry at Georgetown University Medical School and was a consultant to the Public Affairs Commission of the American Psychiatric Association. During the more than 25 years that Dr. Tamarkin practiced psychiatry, he gained a reputation for his ability to help prominent political and entertainment figures deal with their many stresses. At a time when this was considered unorthodox, his sense of intellectual adventure led him to integrate psychological, social and physiological factors in both his medical practice and his life. June Bingham, co-author with Dr. Tamarkin of ''The Pursuit of Health'' (1986), said ''The world is full of people who are a lot better for having known Norman Tamarkin, either professionally or otherwise.'' Dr. Tamarkin was widely loved because of his gift for friendship. Survivors include his companion, Sabrina Cassagnol; his sister, Bryn Tamarkin-Jacobstein; his nephew, Tommy; and scores of loving friends.
