        MINKIN-Emma Lee Min. A wonderful little girl of extraordinary spirit and charm who gave so much joy in such a tragically short time. My deepest condolences to her adoring parents, Betsy and Josh, grandmothers Rosalie and Ruth, Uncle William, Aunt Naomi, and her aunts, uncles and cousins in Israel. May they and all the many others who loved her continue to draw warmth from her incredible light. Vicki
