        ROBINS-Eva. Eve was a labor arbitrator, friend, mentor, traveler, pioneer & crossword and Scrabble fiend. She was loving, unpretentious, steadfast, ethical and had a wonderful sense of humor. Her sisters, brothers, nieces and nephews will always treasure her influence, guidance, support and nurturing. Services will be private and a memorial service will be scheduled in the future. Contributions may be made to the Macular Degeneration Foundation.
        ROBINS-Eva. Labor arbitration has lost a legendary figure and servant of the public interest. Former Nat'l Academy President and Vice Chair of OCB, she was beloved, inspirational & respected. Her skills, uncompromising ethics and dedication helped thousands of unions & employers peacefully resolve differences. Her wisdom & guidance will be sorely missed.
