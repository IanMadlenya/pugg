        SCHUMANN-Maurice. We express our deep sympathy to the family of Maurice Schumann and, in particular, to his daughter Laurence Schumnn Heckscher, her husband Stephen Hackscher, and their children Benjamin, Timothy and Olivia. Maurice Schumann was a voice of freedom and dignity on his side of the Atlantic as Laurence's late father-in-law, August Heckscher was a voice of faith and hope on this side of the ocean. May the values of civilization that Maurice Schumann and August Heckscher articulated by their words and courage continue to inspire all of us. Hilde Huston Francis X. Morrissey, Jr.
