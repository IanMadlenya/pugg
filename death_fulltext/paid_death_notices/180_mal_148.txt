        SUMMER-Sol G. A man who made this world a much nicer place to live in. He enriched our lives with his friendship. His smile was warm sunshine; his heart, pure gold. Our sympathies go out to his beloved Anita and his family. He leaves such a void in all our lives. May he rest in peace. Barbara and Bentley
