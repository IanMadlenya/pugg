        TOWASSER-Jean Shirley (nee Monck). Died in her bed on November 24, 1998, in her home in Riverside, CT. Beloved wife to the late David E. Towasser. Ceaselessly devoted and loving mother to Nicholas Towasser. A memorial service will be held on December 12, at 2 PM at Gallagher's Funeral Home, 2900 Summer St, Stamford, CT. Born in Northumberland, England on May 11, 1930. Shirley attended King's College, University of Durham. She wrote for The Guardian (Manchester) and The Observer (London). She came to the United States in 1960, and was a researcher for Time. Beginning in 1967, she devoted her time to raising her newly born son. She returned to her editorial career in the early 1980's as a researcher for Vanity Fair and later for House & Garden. She retired in 1993, and for several years worked as a fund raiser for Carnegie Hall. Never, never was there a woman of greater integrity, wit, wisdom and beauty. A generous woman, Shirley was quick to help both friend and stranger alike. Donations in her memory can be made to Housing Works and to God's Love We Deliver. Her son deeply misses the loss of his mother and best friend.
