        Correction:  September 1, 1998, Tuesday  An obituary on Aug. 2 of Dr. Edward F. Edinger, a leading American interpreter of the psychoanalytical theories of Carl Jung, referred to Dr. Edinger's marital status incorrectly. He and Frances McCarthy were not divorced but were still married when she died in 1995; at his death, Dr. Edinger was not married to his companion, Dianne D. Cordic.
