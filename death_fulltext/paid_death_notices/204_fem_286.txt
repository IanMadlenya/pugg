        OSNOS--Berna, 73, youngest child of Charles and Jane Mayer of New York City.

Her courage in battling and finally accepting her fate serves as a model for us all. A celebration of her life will be held on her birthday, February 7, for friends and family at the home of Simon Osnos in Cabin John, MD.
