        WEINBERGER-Esther. The community of West End Synagogue, a Reconstructionist Congregation is saddened by the death of Esther Weinberger, a founding memberand long-time Reconstructionist. We extend our condolences to her daughter Lucy, her son Jon and his wife Jane, her grandson David and to all of her family. A devoted wife and loving mother, Esther was prevented by illness in recent years from participation in synagogue activities, yet we always knew of her concern for our well being and commitment to our success. Her warmth, her humor, her exceptional sensitivity to beauty and aesthetics will all be missed. May her memory be for a blessing.
