        LEVIN-Robert Nathan, librettist and pianist, died in Perugia, Italy, on March 4 of cancer at the age of 56. He had lived in Italy for several years while collaborating on an opera and cantata scheduled for performance shortly. Born in New York City, Mr. Levin was a graduate of Columbia University in 1967 and in 1969 received his M.A. in French and English philology. Through a PhD candidate in comparative literature, he pursued a career as a pianist and teacher of music and foreign languages. With his wife, Zaida, a violinist, he performed widely on the East Coast. He taught for many years at Manhattan School of Music and had a large following of devoted private students. In recent years, he also spent much of his time writing, translating, and doing scholarly research in literature. He is survived by his wife, Zaida, mother Pam Levin of New York City, sister Nina Jalladeau of Paris and halfsister Joan Kirsch of Portland, Oregon. A memorial service was held in Perugia.
