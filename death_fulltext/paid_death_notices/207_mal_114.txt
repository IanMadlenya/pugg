        RIZAVI--Syed Alay Zamin, M.D. Died Wednesday, March 24, 2004 at home in New York City. A doctor to the core, his compassion, kindness and goodness knew no bounds. He showed his family and friends how to combine confidence, competence, humility and warmth. He was the son of Alay Nabi, the Mayor of Agra, India, and member of the Parliament and Moquidissa and was the youngest of six children. Dr. Rizavi was raised in Agra, and moved to Karachi, Pakistan. He attended King Edward Medical College and specialized in Cardiology and Tropical Diseases in Edinburgh, Scotland. Dr. Rizavi returned to practice medicine in Pakistan as Civil Surgeon of Karachi. He then worked at New York Hospital on a World Health Organization scholarship, and in 1976, he and his family moved to Evanston, IL, and then Winnetka, IL. Dr. Rizavi practiced medicine at Evanston Hospital from 1975 until 2003, when he moved to New York City. He is survived by his wife, two daughters, son-in-law, as well as three grandchildren, two brothers, a sister and many nieces and nephews. We cherished our moments with him and he will be with us in spirit. Memorial gifts should be directed to Evanston Northwestern Healthcare Foundation, Dr. Rizavi Memorial, 1603 Orrington, Suite 750, Evanston, IL 60201, 847-570-5601.
