        ARON--Jerome. Jerry Aron was a very special friend to the Trust for Mutual Understanding and the Asian Cultural Council. On the many trips we made with him and Elizabeth, there was no better storyteller, more brilliant limmerickist, or finer fellow traveler. Those of us lucky enough to be with such a great couple--in Russia, Asia, or anywhere--were always in for a wonderful ride. Jerry will be sorely missed by everyone at TMU and ACC.
        ARON--Jerome. The Juilliard community mourns the passing of Jerome Aron, beloved husband of Juilliard's Vice Chairman, Elizabeth McCormack. With intelligence, wit and deep compassion for all Jerry addressed, he touched us in very profound ways. We express our deepest condolences to Elizabeth and to Jerry's children and grandchildren. Bruce Kovner, Chairman Joseph W. Polisi, President The Juilliard School
