        BITTENBENDER -- Douglas, who led Crafton Graphics, a highly influential New York lithography firm in the seventies and eighties, died on March 28, 2004 in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Surviving family members are Joan Breibart, Peter Bittenbender and Roger Bittenbender. Doug was a member of the Board of Directors of the American Institute of Graphic Arts, and was an owner of Graphis magazine, the elegant Swiss journal of the graphic arts. A born leader, Doug Bittenbender's skills on a ski slope in Vermont, a river in Maine, or a horse trail in Massachusetts, were exceeded only by his zeal and skill in introducing and teaching his family and friends about them. His family will announce details of a memorial service to be held in the near future. Contributions in Doug's memory may be made to Planned Parenthood Federation of America.
