        PECK-Harris, M.D. The Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University mourns the passing of our professor emeritus, a distinguished psychiatrist and educator who was associated with our medical school for four decades. A pioneer in social and community psychiatry, he inspired countless students by the example he set as a caring and socially-conscious physician. We extend our deepest condolences to the entire Peck family. Dominick P. Purpura, M.D. Dean, Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University
