        KOCH--Susan Dryfoos. Cherished mother of Peggy Koch Palmer and her husband Briggs S. Palmer Jr., and Kathy Koch Willens and her husband Randall D. Willens, passed away on September 9, 2005, after a long and courageous battle with cancer. Adored by many, Susan knew how to be a true friend. She devoted herself to the cause of women and children whose lives were marred by violence. She was the Chair of the Family Violence Divisional Board and a valued member of the Board of Trustees of the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services. Formerly, Susan worked as a stockbroker, a career she loved. She was an avid bridge enthusiast, a plant lover, and the adoring grandmother of Charlotte and Daniel Willens, and Jordan and Christopher Palmer. She is also survived by her loving nieces, Jennifer Dryfoos and Liz Young, and her sister-in-law Sally Mayer. We will always hold her precious memory in our hearts. In lieu of flowers, donations in her memory may be sent to the the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, 120 W. 57th St, NYC 10019. A memorial service will be held at Frank E. Campbell, Madison Ave at 81 St, Sunday, October 2, at 1 PM. $(6$)KOCH--Susan D.
