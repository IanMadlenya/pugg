        ZIEMAN--Isaac. The Dialogue Project will deeply miss the presence of Isaac. His experience, wisdom and spirit touched all of us. His concern and compassion for the rights and needs of all people, and his passionate commitment to social justice, made his a voice that Jews, Palestinians, Muslims, Christians and others, heard with the greatest respect. He helped us to understand more deeply. We send our condolences to his wife, Ingeborg, and his entire family. The Board of the Dialogue Project
