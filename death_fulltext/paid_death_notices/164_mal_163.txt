        EIMICKE-Victor W. The Trustees and Staff of the National Bible Association express a profound sense of loss and sorrow upon the death of Dr. Victor W. Eimicke, their colleague and friend. Dr. Eimicke began his relationship with the Association as a volunteer in 1969. Elected to the Board of Trustees in 1975, he has served as treasurer, president and chairman of the Board. His love for the Scriptures informed and shaped his life and character, making him the family man, churchman, and business leader whom we loved and respected. His wise counsel and generous spirit will be missed by all who knew him. We extend our prayers and deepest sympathy to his wife, Maxine, his daughters Laura and Alicia, and the other members of his family. ''Well done, thou good and faithful servant: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.'' Thomas R. May, President Stewart S. Furlong, Chairman National Bible Association
        EIMICKE-Victor W., Ph.d. The Governors and staff of Lawrence Hospital are deeply saddened by the death of our longtime friend Victor W. Eimicke. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Maxine, and his entire family.
