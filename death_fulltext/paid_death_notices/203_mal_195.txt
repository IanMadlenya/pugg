        KLATELL -- Jack, D.D.S. Dean Ira B. Lamster, Columbia University School of Dental and Oral Surgery, notes with deep sorrow the death of our esteemed colleague, Dr. Jack Klatell, Clinical Professor of Dentistry, on December 11, 2003. He graduated magna cum laude from City College in 1937 where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and received his D.D.S. from Columbia University in 1941. As Director of the Department of Dentistry at Mount Sinai Hospital, Jack was a dedicated educator and was instrumental in the development of the intramural program between the University and Hospital. He was a member of the American Dental Association, the American Academy of Oral Pathology, the American Association of Hospital Dentists, the Metropolitan Council of Hospital Dental Chiefs, and the Academy of General Dentistry. As a clinician, he provided exemplary care to his countless patients. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife Arla, sons Robert and David, and the entire Klatell family.
        KLATELL--Jack, DDS. My dear friend, mentor, and partner of 25 years. Jack Klatell was loved by his family, friends and thousands of grateful patients. Jack's character, curiosity and generosity will never be forgotten. Nicholas, Bretta, Gail and Wilfred Heilbut
