        FITZGERALD-W. Francis. The Board of Managers of Lincoln Hall mourn the passing of our beloved Board member, W. Francis FitzGerald. Frank faithfully served on the Board for 50 years as Vice President, Secretary and Treasurer. He was also Chairman of the Executive and Finance Committees and was a member of the Audit and Insurance, Buildings and Grounds, Pension and Program Committees. Frank was highly instrumental consummating the sale of land of the original site of the Catholic Protectory in Parkchester to Metropolitan Life; the sale of land to the Town of Somers School District, and finally, he was principal in the sale of land which is presently the Anglebrook Golf Course. Frank's history with our agency is rich with his contributions. A strong advocate of children's rights, and his dedication to the youth served by Lincoln Hall are exceeded only by his total commitment to the Hall. All of us who knew Frank personally will miss his wonderful sense of humor and cherish his memory. James G. Nugent, President and the Lincoln Hall Board of Managers
