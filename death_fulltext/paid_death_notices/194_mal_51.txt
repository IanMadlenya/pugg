        YAGER-Rabbi Ascher M. Yeshiva University and its affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary are deeply saddened by the passing of our second oldest rabbinic alumnus at 97 years of age. Rabbi Yager, who was our single largest donor among pulpit rabbis, was a Yeshiva University Guardian, who established the Edith Yager Memorial Scholarship and the Rabbi Ascher M. Yager Rabbinic Kollel Fellowship at RIETS. Rabbi Yager served in seven major congregations in the New York area-the most recent being the Inwood Hebrew Congregation. He lived at the Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale where he was deeply beloved. A staunch and loyal representative of Orthodoxy, he was an eloquent speaker and a kind, gentle personality with a rich sense of humor and an elegant demeanor. He was cherished by all of us at YU/ RIETS and was honored in 1999 at our annual dinner with the ''RIETS Tomekh Rabbanim Award.'' He will be sorely missed. May his son-in-law, David Shapiro, grandchildren: Daniel, Jonathan and Michael; nieces: Phyllis (and Richard) Smith, Bunny (and Leonard) Libenson; his cousins, Shirley and Alvin Fishman, and his entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
