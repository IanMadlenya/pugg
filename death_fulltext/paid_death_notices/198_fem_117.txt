        DAVIS--June (born September 7, 1905), of Sarasota, FL, on July 13, 2003. Beloved wife of the late Samuel Davis and loving mother of Patricia Gondelman and the late Robert Davis. Cherished grandmother of Mark, Kyle, Joel, Alicia, Bradford, Hillary and Lauren, and great-grandmother of 14. A ''Ziegfeld Girl'' in the 1920s, she devoted her life to her family. ''Mom,'' ''Nanny June,'' ''Nana,'' ''Tata''--Your personal strength and great sense of humor have shaped who we are. You are ageless and priceless, and we will always miss you. A memorial service will be held at a later date. In lieu of flowers, contributions to a local animal shelter would be appreciated. >>AD#
