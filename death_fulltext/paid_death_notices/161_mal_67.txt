        McCARTHY-John T., MD. The Board of Trustees and Medical Staff of Lenox Hill Hospital express their sorrow at the passing of John T. McCarthy, MD, a distinguished member of our Dermatology Section for 34 years and its chief from 1966 until 1988. Widely respected for his outstanding clinical and diagnostic skills, Dr. McCarthy loved the art and science of medicine. He was also a gifted teacher who was devoted to sharing his extensive knowlege with young physicians. Lenox Hill Hospital honors the memory of this exceptional physician who exemplified the highest standards of his profession. We extend our deepest sympathies to his family. James S.
