        $(6$)FREED--James Ingo. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum mourns the passing of world renowned architect James Ingo Freed. The Museum, which he designed, is an enduring legacy and a monumental achievement, receiving the American Institute of Architects Honor Award for Architecture in 1994. Freed was a witness to Kristallnacht as a young boy in 1938 in his home town of Essen, Germany, and he escaped to the United States in 1939. His architectural genius is evident in the Museum's evocative design, which integrates the memorial experience throughout the building. He has given the world an emotionally powerful ''resonator of memory'' that has deepened the educational impact of the 23 million individuals who have visited the Museum from all over the world. We will be forever grateful to his singular contribution to the memory of the victims and to the education of future generations. Fred S. Zeidman, Chairman Joel M. Geiderman, Vice Chairman Sara J.
