        LAZARUS--Lester ''Roy'', inspired Opera Director dies at age 76. Roy Lazarus, performer, opera director, and educator, died of cardiac arrest on April 13th in Maine where he had made is home since 1986. A brilliant performer, he went on to translate his insight and approach to performance into a truly valid and usable stage technique which influenced countless numbers of students. His career spanned some 60 years and covered all aspects of the operatic and musical theater genres. Heard on national radio at age 15 as ''The Boy Basso from Brooklyn,'' he went on to be educated at Syracuse University. Returning to the stage in New York City he was engaged as Al, one of the four cowboys in the original Broadway production of Frank Loesser's musical ''The Most Happy Fella.'' The show's hit song ''Standin' On The Corner'' created one of the most memorable moments in Broadway history. The quartet subsequently appeared on the ''Ed Sullivan'' and ''I Love Lucy'' shows. He also appeared on Broadway in ''How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying'' and often worked with Don Adams and Carol Burnett at Green Mansions in the Adirondacks. In his late 20s he focused on opera and sang for several years with the New York City Opera. In the mid 1960s he taught at the Juilliard School. Ultimately, he became Professor of Opera at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music in Ohio where he founded and directed the Oberlin Music Theater. This important summer festival helped train a generation of young artists. The roster of opera houses around the country is testimony to the success of his program. Mr. Lazarus directed opera companies across the United States. In recent years he taught voice in Maine and continued to coach various established artists. Roy Lazarus is survived by his son Steven and grandson Joseph of Peoria, AZ, his son David and grandsons Matthew and Paul of Castle Rock, CO and his sister Bernice of Boca Raton, FL. He will be deeply missed.
