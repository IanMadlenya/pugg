        GAMMEL - Patricia Barry. On September 13, 2002, from cancer. Patty loved life, her family and friends. She touched everyone with her energy, kindness and generosity. Patty loved to play tennis, dance, laugh, cook, read voraciously, drink a glass of Chardonnay, and most of all, to celebrate Christmas with her family, friends or anyone who needed a place to go. She was the only one we ever knew who could do the Sunday New York Times crossword puzzle in ink without a mistake. During the span of her professional career, Patty positively impacted the lives of many in just as many different ways, from her volunteer activities, to being a teacher, to positions she held with State government and charitable foundations, and as a mentor throughout. She was an activist in the civil rights movement, a VISTA volunteer, and an A.I.D. worker in Vietnam. Patty's presence in our lives was a remarkable blessing. A memorial service will be held at Saint Michael's Church, 505 Broome Street, Fernandina Beach, FL. on October 12, 2002 at 2PM. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The Bellflower Center for Prevention of Child Abuse, attn: Development Dept., 11811 Shaker Blvd, Suite 220, Cleveland, OH. 44120.
