        RANDOLPH--Muriel L., 74, died in a landslide on March 15, while in northern Vietnam. Founder and president of Randolph Properties, a real estate brokerage firm in Westchester County, she was known to friends and family as Mickey. She was born and raised in Brooklyn and graduated from Adelphi College. She lived in Chappaqua for 45 years where she raised her three children with her late husband Stephen B. Randolph. She was active and influential in the real estate industry, and served as president of the Westchester County Board of Realtors and also served on the boards of the New York State Association of Realtors and the National Association of Realtors. Locally, she was active in the Chappaqua Rotary Club, the Newcastle League of Women Voters, and the Chamber of Commerce. She served on the board of directors of the Chappaqua Historical Society and the board of the Katonah Museum of Art. Despite her prominent role in the community, she shunned the spotlight and simply touched countless lives in her own quiet but forceful and inimitable style. She will be forever missed by her children Marc, Lindsay, and Randolph as well as five grandchildren. The family will receive members of the community on Monday, at the Katonah Museum of Art from 14 PM. For more information, contact 914-238-9001.
