        QUINN-Sheila. The partners and staff of Morris & McVeigh LLP mourn the sudden loss of Sheila Quinn, the head of our Tax Department. We will miss the warmth of her personality, her sense of humor and sage advice. We extend our deepest sympathy to her sisters, Eileen T. Giacobbe and Kathleen A. Brozowski, and her nieces and nephews.
