        MARKOWITZ-Alfred M., M. D. The Department of Surgery of Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons and New YorkPresbyterian Hospital are deeply saddened by the death of our dear friend and collegue, Dr. Alfred Markowitz. Dr. Markowitz, who was Professor Emeritus of Clinical Surgery at the time of his death, served the medical center with distinction for nearly half a century as an educator, clinician, and researcher. He was particularly known for his teaching of medical students and training of surgical residents, and was considered one of Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center's most respected practitioners. He was much loved and will be greatly missed. We extend our heartfelt condolences to the Markowitz family.
        MARKOWITZ-Alfred, M.D. We have lost a dear, trusted friend and will treasure his memory. Our love to Sydell and the family. Florence and Nathan Reiff
