        SHABAZZ-Dr. Betty. The Women's Leadership Forum of the DNC acknowledges with deepest regret the passing of Dr. Betty Shabazz, an active and outstanding member since the Forum's inception. The knowledge, experience, depth, and humanity Dr. Shabazz brought to our discourse will be greatly missed. May those who survive her be comforted by fond memories of her warm smile and the kindness she shared with all who knew her. Cynthia Friedman, National Chair
