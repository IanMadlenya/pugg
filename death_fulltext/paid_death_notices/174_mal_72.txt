        KAHN-Rabbi Benjamin. We record with sorrow the passing of our revered colleague, who dedicated three decades of his rabbinate to working with young men and women on campuses, beginning in 1940 as rabbi of the B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundation at Penn State University and later assuming executive directorship of the Hillel system, directing the work of Hillel on an increasing number of campuses in the United States and abroad. In 1971 he was asked by B'nai B'rith International to become its executive vice president, a post held until his retirement. We extend our condolences to his family and to all whose lives were touched by his rabbinate. His memory is a blessing for his life was a blessing. Rabbi Vernon H. Kurtz, Pres. Rabbi Joel H. Meyers, Exec. V.P. The Rabbinical Assembly
