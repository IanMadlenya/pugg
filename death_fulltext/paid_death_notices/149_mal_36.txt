        YATES-Michael Scott. On May 31, 1999, at age 47. Devoted father of Parker Scott, beloved son of David and Trudy Yates, dear brother of David C. Yates and Ann Bourne, cherished brother-in-law of Constance Yates and Stephen Bourne and adored uncle of Elisabeth, Michael and Emily Bourne. Michael had an exuberance for life, and his boyish charm and natural wit were legend to family, friends and colleagues. We deeply mourn his untimely death and shall forever miss his love and attention. May his soul rest in eternal peace. A memorial service will be held at 2:00 P.M. on Saturday, June 12th, at the First Presbyterian Church, Circleville, Ohio. In lieu of flowers contributions may be made in Michael's memory to Save the Children Federation, Inc.
