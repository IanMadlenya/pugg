        LEVY--David, former New York State Supreme Court Justice, passed away on Wednesday, August 2, at his residence in Pompton Plains, NJ. He was 79 years old. Born April 22, 1927, in New York, David had a distinguished legal career. Prior to becoming a judge, he was a solo practitioner for more than 20 years and was active in the NAACP in the 1950s and the Democratic Reform movement during the early 1960s, including a narrow defeat in a highly contested 1962 Congressional race during which he received endorsements from Eleanor Roosevelt, Governor Lehman and Mayor Robert Wagner. Elected to the Court in 1973, David retired from the bench in 1996 after more than 20 years of service. Prior to moving to NJ one year ago, David was a lifelong resident of the Bronx, and devoted husband to his wife Diane for 50 years until she passed away in 2003. David attended DeWitt Clinton HS, volunteered and served with the US Navy during World War II, attended NYU in the Bronx, and graduated Columbia Law School in 1951. Survivors include his sons, Bob of Branford, CT, Paul of Ardsley, NY and Bruce of Cedar Knolls, NJ, and six grandsons. Funeral services will be held at Bernheim Apter Kreitzman, 68 Old Short Hills Rd., Livingston, NJ on Thursday, August 3, at 11:30 AM. For additional info, call Bernheim Apter 1-800-938-6372.
