        HOWARTH-Harold. A longtime resident of Rowayton, CT died at home on Saturday, July 17. An accountant, he was a retired partner of Ernst & Young, and an active member of St. Luke's Episcopal Church in Darien, CT. Born in Bolton, England in 1920, he immigrated with his family to New Bedford, Massachusetts as a small child. The son of the late William and Hester Howarth, he is survived by his elder brother William of San Diego, California, a nephew, Dr. Jonathan Kelley, and many friends, and was predeceased by his longtime companion, Donovan Hogan. He attended local schools in New Bedford, won a scholarship to Boston University, where he continued in graduate school, and later taught. On the eve of World War II, he was commissioned in the U.S. Army, and served in the Pacific in New Guinea and the Philippines as an artillery officer on the staff of General Rhett Stuart. Discharged from active duty as a major, he was an active reservist for some years. He joined Leidersdorf which later merged with what was then Ernst and Whinney and served until his retirement in 1979. A gifted classical pianist, in his later years he discovered a talent as an amateur actor with St. Luke's Players. Since retirement, he had taken an annual month-long trip to England and remained a devoted Anglophile. A memorial service will be held at a later date. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to St. Luke's Episcopal Church, Book of Remembrance, 1864 Post Road, Box 3128, Darien, CT 06820 or to Boston University, Attn.
