        SCHEAR--Stanley. It is with great sadness that Family Services of Westchester honors the passing of Stanley Schear. Stanley joined FSW in 2002 as Director of the agency's LIFE program (Living Independently for the Frail Elderly). As a member of FSW's executive team, Stanley initiated programs that serve the homeless and frail elderly. Underlying everything he did was a belief in the dignity of human life. A great voice has been silenced, but we are grateful for the opportunity to have known and worked with Stanley Schear. The Board of Directors and Staff of FSW
