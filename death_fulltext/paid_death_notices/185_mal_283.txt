        von BERNUTH-Charles M. Of Lyford Cay, Bahamas, passed away on May 25, 2002, at the age of 89. Beloved husband of the late Eloise Fiamingo. He was educated in the U.S. and Switzerland, and joined the family business, Bernuth Lembcke Co of NY, creosote importers and a shipping company. During WWII, originally he was a Calvary officer in the U.S. Army at Ft. Riley, KS, and later was recruited as a Captain into the O.S.S, where he was awarded the Silver Star for bravery in action. At war's end he returned to the family business, retiring in 1962, when he moved with his family to Rome, Italy, living there for over 30 years. A superb horseman, horses were the center of his life. He trained horses, judged at the National Horse Show, played polo at Meadowbrook with the very greats, receiving honorable mention; he just genuinely loved horses. He was a world traveler visiting all seven continents with his late wife, multi-lingual, multitalented, a writer, actor, dancer, composer-lyricist, skier, yachtsman, leatherworker, even conquering the unicycle. Actively involved in community affairs, he was a member of Squadron A, The Sleepy Hollow Country Club and The Lyford Cay Club. On the human side there are no superlatives to adequately describe his dignity, his charm, his honesty, his generosity, his humor. Elegant and stunningly handsome with all the social graces, he lived a wondrous and joyous life. He is survived by his first wife Shirley Paige Bernuth, their four children, Antonia Cook, Ticia Agri, Victoria Bernuth and Charles P. von Bernuth, four grandchildren, his nephews, Ernest P. Bernuth Jr. and James T. Bernuth and his neice Barbara King, his loving friend Dorothy Kohler, together with a host of other adoring friends. Memorial www.charlesvonbernuth .com.
