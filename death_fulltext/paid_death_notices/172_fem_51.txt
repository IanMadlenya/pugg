        STADTMAUER-Paula. We extend our heartfelt sympathies and condolences to our dear Helene, and to David, Susan and Alan, Nana and Lenny and their entire families upon the passing of their most beloved Paula. Energetic and inspiring to the end, she lived her life with boundless love for her husband, children, grandchildren, family and friends. No detail was too small, or task too burdensome. Her successful and enduring accomplishments in establishing jobtraining programs for the unskilled and underprivileged afforded many hundreds of worthy individuals a new start on life. In this and many other ways, she set an extraordinary example of discrete but effective Chesed, and embodied the Rabbinic advise to ''Say little, but do much.'' May the memory of her devotion to her family and friends and the enduring consequences of her actions provide perpetual comfort to all who were touched by her, and especially to the center of her universe, her husband David, her mother Rose Goodman, her children Alan, Susan and Joel, Helene and Josh, and her grandchildren Dani, Cal, Jeremy, Gabrielle, Alex and Rebecca.
