        TROUTT-Dr. Bobbye. The New York University Postdoctoral Program in psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis deeply mourns the loss of Dr. Bobbye Troutt. As supervisor, analyst, teacher and friend, she inspired us with her warmth, humor and generosity, with her rare ability to combine intellectual brilliance with intimate compassion, and with her courage and integrity. She was an irreplaceable member of our community.
