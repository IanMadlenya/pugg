        WINSLOW - Diane. Memorial Mass for our dear friend Saturday September 22, Noon, Holy Innocents, 128 W 37, NYC. Diane was born May 26, 1943 in the Shandong Compound, Japanese-prisoner-ofwar camp, Weihsien, China and died on her 58th birthday, in Houston, TX, from brain tumors. She was a graduate of the International School of the Sacred Heart, Tokyo, Japan, Vassar, NYU, a real New Yorker and a very gentle soul. May Diane rest in peace. ISSH Schoolmates
