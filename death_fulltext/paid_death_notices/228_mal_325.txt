        TEMKO--Allan B. We mourn Allan, a dear friend for over half a century, the author of Notre Dame of Paris, a Pulitzer Prize winning architectural critic who was a major force for good design in the San Francisco area. A man of strong opinions which he expressed pungently, Allan especially loved to review major ''to be built'' governmental projects which, on a number of occasions, were modified in response to his criticism. At the time of his death, Allan was involved in planning a seminar in New York for the Forum for Urban Design on the practical impact of architectural criticism and few critics have had the impact Allan Temko did. We extend heartfelt condolences to his daughter, Susannah, & his son, Alexander. Daniel & Joanna S. Rose
