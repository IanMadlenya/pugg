        DYSON-Dr. Anne E. The Board and the Staff of the Hole in the Wall Gang Fund are deeply saddened by the passing of Dr. Anne Dyson. She served our organization from its earliest stage with skill, generosity and commitment. Most especially, however, we will remember her compassion and humanity on behalf of the seriously ill children in our care. Each person affiliated with the Hole in the Wall Gang says ''God Bless You'' on behalf of the thousands of children whose lives were made better in so many ways by Anne Dyson. Our sincere sympathy goes out to each member of her family, to whom she meant so much.
        DYSON-Dr. Anne E. The Board of Directors and staff of the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute mourn the loss of Dr. Anne E. Dyson. A distinguished and compassionate leader, she has left an indelible mark on the lives of the Hudson Valley community-especially its children. Dr. Dyson was a special friend, counselor and supporter of the ideals and programs of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt through the Institute and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library and Museum. We share the sorrow of her beloved family. Anna Eleanor Roosevelt, President William J. vanden Heuvel, Chairman
