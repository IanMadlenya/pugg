        MITCHELL--Ehrman B., FAIA, co-founder of Mitchell/ Giurgola Architects in 1958, died on January 18 in Philadelphia, age 80. With partner, AIA Gold Medalist Romaldo Giurgola, the firm became internationally known very prominently for the Australia National Parliament House (1980).

He was AIA National President in 1979 and mentored two offices that continue to thrive. He is survived by his son Eric, daughter Marianne, and three grandchildren. His wife, Hermine, died in 2004. Memorial service will be held 2:00 PM Saturday, January 29 at the Germantown Friends Meeting House, 47 Coulter St, Philadelphia. Donations may be made to the Ehrman B. Mitchell Fund, at the Unviersity of Pennsylvania School of Design. With fond remembrance to our mentor, Mitchell/Giurgola Architects, New York, MGA Partners, Philadelphia.
