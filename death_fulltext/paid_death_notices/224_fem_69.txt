        BERNSTEIN--Florence, died September 7. For many years Florence was the Public Relations Coordinator at The New York Philharmonic, and previously worked as a personal assistant to a number of Hollywood celebrities, including Charles Bronson and Shirley MacLaine. All of her Kaufman family cousins, Jay, Carol and John, Newton, Milton and Shannon, and Robert and Kim, send their deepest sympathies to her twin sister Charlotte and her loving nephews on this sad occasion.
