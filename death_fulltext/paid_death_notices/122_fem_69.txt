        HASTINGS-Louise Laurent (Lily). It is with deep regret that we note the passing of Lily Hastings on March 7th, 1997 after a long illness while in St. Vincent's Hospital, NYC. Born in Lyon, France, September 9th, 1908; on December 22nd, 1945, she was married in Paris to the musician, Baird Hastings. After a distinguished career as a coutouriere, she collaborated with her husband on many artistic productions including Gilbert and Sullivan's ''Trial by Jury,'' and editing the pocket review of the arts, ''Chrysalis,'' and she managed the bookstore of the Harvard University Press, 1951-1959. For a score of years, she designed period costumes for more than a dozen OffBroadway plays and ballets. Wellknown in her circle, she was the subject of one of Virgil Thomson's unique ''Portraits in Music.'' The co-director of the French Art Theatre, James Lewis, said of her, ''She was French to the core; she was a great cook; she was a wonderful partner.'' Her only survivor is her husband.
