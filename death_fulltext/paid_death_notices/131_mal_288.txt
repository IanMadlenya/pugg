        TUCHMAN-Lester, M.D. It is with great sorrow that The Mount Sinai Alumni mourns the passing of our distinguished friend and colleague. He served the hospital for over fifty years, training generations of residents in his specialty of internal medicine. A warm and generous man, he established a scholarship to ensure the medical education of worthy students. In 1966, the Mount Sinai Alumni presented its most coveted award, the Jacobi Medallion, to Dr. Tuchman in acknowledgment of his profound professional achievements and his extraordinary service to the Medical Center and the Alumni. Our Sincere condolences are extended to his family. Wayne S. Fuchs, M.D., President Avi Barbasch, M.D., Vice Pres. Maria Padilla, M.D., Secretary William G. Stein, M.D., Treasurer
