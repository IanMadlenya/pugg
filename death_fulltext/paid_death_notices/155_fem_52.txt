        KNICK-Alice Alice Knick was a loyal and dedicated Reform Democrat. As District Leader for the Lexington Democratic Club, she was a leader in every sense of the word. Alice was a continuing source of enlightenment and assistance for her Turtle Bay constituents, updating them on political candidates and issues while helping them with problems, personal and bureaucratic. They, and we, will truly miss her. Lexington Democratic Club (Memorial service to be announced)
