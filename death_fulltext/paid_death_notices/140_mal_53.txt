        GERETY-Pierce. The Board of Directors and staff of the International Rescue Committee (IRC) are saddened by the tragic loss of Pierce on his flight to Geneva for the UN High Commission for Refugees. From 1980 to 1982 Pierce directed IRC's humanitarian work in Thailand for Cambodian refugees fleeing from the Khmer Rouge. Joining him in the effort was his wife, Marie de la Soudiere, who now directs IRC's program for children affected by armed conflict. When he finished his critical assignment for IRC, Pierce joined the United Nations where he continued his refugee work with the same outstanding courage, devotion, leadership and effectiveness that marked his years at IRC. The Gerety family has a distinguished history of service to the refugee cause. His father, Pierce J. Gerety, Sr., was an active IRC board member, & his brother Tom, President of Amherst College, is a current member. We will miss Pierce deeply. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to Marie, and their three children, Sebastian, Pierce & Maeve, and all members of the Gerety family.
