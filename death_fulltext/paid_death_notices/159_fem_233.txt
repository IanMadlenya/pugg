        TOBIA-Sr. Mary Geraldine. The children, families and staff of St. Christopher-Ottilie deeply mourn the loss of Sister Mary Geraldine who went home to God on Tuesday. Sister Geraldine co-founded the Center for Family Life in Sunset Park with Sister Mary Paul 22 years ago. In concert they became the standard-bearers for the importance of preventive services that are truly community based. Sister Geraldine's energy, vitality and zeal had a profound impact on the children and families of the Sunset Park Community she so dearly loved. Sister Geraldine embodied the spirit of love, which she shared with so many. Robert J. McMahon Executive Director
