        LEVY--Walter K. With the deepest love through our enduring lifetime friendship, we & our children grieve with Anita, Gregg, Evonne, Irene, Kumi and their extended family and many friends for our unimaginable loss. Through great energy, skill, stick-to-itiveness, intelligence, creativity, personality, ambition and many other talents, and with Anita always alongside and behind him, he earned his way to the very height of his profession as management consultant to the leading department stores and retail chains throughout America, Europe and Asia. He was a widely respected commentator with an untold number of articles, television appearances and speaking engagements in many countries. But that was only the minor achievement of his life. The major achievement of his life was his stature as a human being, starting with the thoughtfulness and caring he bestowed on the lights of his life, his family and close friends, a life he began anew with Anita (and then the kids) just a few days shy of 50 years ago in a chapel at Northwestern University. He was one of those rare persons who thought of others first and himself last. We are left with an emptiness of heart & surely will miss him. Judith and Stephen Kaye
