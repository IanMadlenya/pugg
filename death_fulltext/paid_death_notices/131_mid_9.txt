        BERGSTEIN-Reba. Migdal Ohr Institutions in Israel and the American Friends of Migdal Ohr deeply mourn the passing of Reba Bergstein, loving and devoted wife of Rabbi David Bergstein. Loving and devoted mother, grandmother and great grandmother to Rabbi Eliyahu Bergstein and his wife, Esther, and to daughter Sharon Kronenberg and her husband, Michael, their children and grandchildren. Master teacher and rebbetzin to two generations of students. An inspiration to all those who had the privilege and good fortune to know her and learn from her. May the Al-Mighty bring forth his comfort to the family in their time of deep bereavement. May they be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Rabbi Yitzchok Dovid Grossman, Founder and Dean Max Thurm, President Shalom Siegfried, Executive Director
