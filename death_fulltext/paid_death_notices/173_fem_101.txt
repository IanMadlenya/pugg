        CORNELL - Patricia Jane. (1925-2001). A gentle and glowing star of stage and family, went peacefully to her rest on Friday, June 8, 2001, in Santa Monica, CA, 75. With sister Shirley, Pat starred with Olsen and Johnson from 1939 to 1948 when she became an executive at J. Walter Thompson. A ninth-generation American, she descended from Jacques Campeau, who traveled with Champlain. Pat's great-grandmother, Louise Leasia, organized the first Catholic Mass in the Saginaw Territory and spoke 11 Indian dialects. Born in Detroit to Michael Basso & Clara Louise Leasia, she was a talented dancer and inventive comedienne, who with her sister Shirley joined Olsen and Johnson in her teens and traveled with them for nine years to every city on the KeithOrpheum Circuit. After the war, Pat appeared on the Milton Berle Show and studied shorthand to land a job at J. Walter Thompson where she produced the Kraft Radio Theater, Rudy Vallee & Edgar Bergen shows. In her greatest starring role, she was mother to her beloved family. She married noted insurance lawyer M.A. ''Pete'' Cornell of Pasadena, CA, & raised her two proud boys, Peter and Christopher. Generous philanthropists, the couple became known as ''Mr & Mrs Santa Claus,'' famed for the Christmas decorations at homes in Pasadena and Huntington Harbor, CA. Pat's superb gourmet cooking and warm hospitality made every guest feel like an old friend. Pat was an anchor and harbor to her family, gentle and gracious, intuitive and insightful, centered and stable, inventive and loving. There is no measure to the sadness felt by her beloved husband Peter, her sister Shirley, children Peter and Christopher, her niece Pati, her great niece and her three grandchildren. It is tempered only by the sure knowledge that throughout her life she lived it to the fullest and gave to others far more than she received. Services are today at Pacific View Memorial Park in Newport Beach, CA.
