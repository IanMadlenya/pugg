        LIBSOHN--David, in the 87th year of his life and in the 60th year of our glorious marriage. Cherished husband of Mitzi. Adored father of Pauli Rose. Destiny put us together when we met by the beautiful sea. We believed in the unbelievable and in a moment of madness we wed. Like SooYin and Mark we found a love that was indeed a manysplendored thing. Good night, sweet prince and thank you for the moon. Mitzi Visiting today 11 AM, services 12 at Gutterman's Funeral Home in Woodbury, L.I. Burial at Mt. Ararat Cemetery, Pine Lawn, L.I.
