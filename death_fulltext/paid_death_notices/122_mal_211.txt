        FUCHS-Joseph. The Juilliard School mourns the passing of distinguished violinist Joseph Fuchs, whose lifetime spanned the entire history of the School from his enrollment as a student in 1906 to his appointment as a faculty member in 1946, which continued to the time of his death. Through his extraordinary accomplishments as a performing artist and as a teacher, he helped establish the standards upon which the music profession in America and around the globe are now based. He was a greatly respected colleague and a revered teacher and friend. He will be deeply missed by us all. His legacy will continue to live on at The Juilliard School. Our condolences are extended to his entire family. Mary Rodgers Guettel Chairman, Board of Trustees Joseph W. Polisi President
