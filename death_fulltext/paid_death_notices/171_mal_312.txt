        SINOPOLI-Giuseppe. The Metropolitan Opera deeply mourns the untimely death of conductor Giuseppe Sinopoli, an extraordinary musician with a bracing intellect, who imbued all his performances with profound feeling. We will not soon forget the performances of ''Tosca'' he led here in 1985 in the current production's premier and telecast. The loss to the world of music in incalculable. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Silvia, and his family. Joseph Volpe, General Manager James Levine, Artistic Director
