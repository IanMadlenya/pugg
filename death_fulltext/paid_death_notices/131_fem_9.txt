        KRANTZ-Linda. Beloved wife of Morry. Devoted mother to Todd and Lauren. Loving mother-in-law to David and Ligia and adoring grandmother to Matthew, Lindsay and Jessica. Passed away early on the morning of November 30, 1997 as she lived with great courage and dignity. Funeral services will be held today at Louis Suburban Chapels, Fairlawn, New Jersey at 12 noon.
