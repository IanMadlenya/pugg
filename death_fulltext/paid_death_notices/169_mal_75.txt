        SPENGLER-Silas. His devotion to clients, attention to legal draftsmanship and high ethical standards were examples followed by all who had the privilege to work with him. A graduate of Andover, Yale College, and University of Pennsylvania Law School, Mr. Spengler began his practice at Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett, and in 1964, co-founded Roth, Carlson, Kwit & Spengler, which grew to some 75 attorneys over the next 28 years. In 1992, his firm, then known as Spengler, Carlson, Gubar, Frischling & Brodsky, combined with the firm now known at Thelen Reid & Priest, where he remained until his retirement from the practice of law in 1994. Mr. Spengler was in every sense, a gentleman, and he will be missed by his friends and colleagues.
        SPENGLER-Silas. Mentor. Friend. Inspiration. Si, your devotion to the Yale Club of New York City and your contributions to its leadership are legendary. We have lost a dear, dear friend but we will never forget you. We at the Yale Club extend our deepest sympathy and condolences to Sandy and the Spengler family.
        SPENGLER-Silas. My deepest sympathy to the family of Sy Spengler, who was my partner, colleague and friend for many years. Sy was a gracious, soft spoken gentleman, who understood the meaning of commitment and loyalty. He will be missed. Carl Frischling
