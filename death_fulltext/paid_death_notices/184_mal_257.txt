        GROSSMAN-Robert M. Late of Southampton, NY died May 20, 2002 in CT Hospice. Born in 1922 in Philadephia, son of the late Isaac and Grace Grossman, he is survived by a brother and sister-inlaw, Jon and Joan Grossman of Stony Creek (Branford) CT, a nephew Perry Grossman and niece Linda Grossman, and his former wife and devoted lifelong friend, Laurel Posner Nader. He was predeceased by a sister, Nancy G. Hart. Bob attended the Philadelphia Museum School of Art before serving in the United States Army artillery during World War II, participating in action in Europe. His lifelong passion for automobiles took many forms. A pioneer in introducing foreign cars into the American market, he established a retail operation in Nyack, NY in the early 1950s. He later became a distributor and importer of various European makes. He enjoyed a notable 25 year career in automobile racing, earning consistent victories on both the US and international circuits. At an early age he began drawing automobiles; over the years this hobby developed into a distinct artform and source of income. Interment private; a memorial celebration will be held at a later date.
