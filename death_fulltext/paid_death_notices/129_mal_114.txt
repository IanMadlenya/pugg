        BLUMBERG-Dr. Albert E. The Congress of Senior Citizens of Greater NY deeply mourns the loss of our long-time president and friend who died October 8, 1997. Al's dedication, leadership and support for the seniors of our city will continue to remain an inspiration for the Congress of Senior Citizens. Al's commitment to the welfare of children and seniors would have him shouting from the grave, ''Don't privatize Social Security.'' Arrangements for a memorial service are being drafted for a later time. We extend our very sincere condolences to the family.
