The Board of Directors and staff of New York City Opera are saddened by the death of Evelyn Sharp, whose generous support for the arts has greatly enriched New York's cultural life, and whose family has played a vital role at City Opera through its ongoing generosity. Her son, the late Peter Jay Sharp, served as President of City Opera from 1979 to 1982, and her daughter, Mary Sharp Cronson, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1992, and currently serves as its Secretary. To our dear friend Mary, our friends Paul and Caroline Cronson, and the entire family, we extend our deepest sympathy. Irwin Schneiderman, Co-Chairman of the Board Paul Kellogg, General Director
