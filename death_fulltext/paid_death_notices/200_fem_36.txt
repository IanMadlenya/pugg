It is with great regret and profound sorrow that the Ecole Active Bilingue Jeannine Manuel in Paris, France, announces the death of their founder. On Thursday, August 28, Mme. Manuel passed away in her home in France with her children by her side. She was 83. Jeannine Manuel was outstanding in her lifetime. Her entire life was devoted to international understanding. During WWII, she participated wholeheartedly in the Resistance and then she turned her own pedagogical project into a world renowned educational establishment: l'Ecole Active Bilingue Jeannine Manuel in Paris and in Lille. Jeannine Manuel was a pedagogical visionary and a linguistic specialist. She was actively present in the life of the school up until her death. Her inspiring presence will live on in the spirit of the school forever. A religious service will be held Saturday, September 6, 2003, at 3 P.M., L'Eglise Reformee du Saint Esprit, 5, rue Ruquepine, 75008 Paris France.
