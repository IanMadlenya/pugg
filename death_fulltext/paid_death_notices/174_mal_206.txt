        GRAHAM-Alan Stuart. Died suddenly, while lunching with friends, on Monday, 16 July, in New York City. An elegant man with superb taste he was a well-known fashion designer in the late forties and early fifties in Manhattan. A protege of Norman Norell and then, under his own label, he was a favorite of Lord & Taylor where he enjoyed coverage in ''Vouge'' and ''Glamour.'' In 1952 he moved to Paris continuing his career in the atelier of Jacques Fath and with the firm Tricot. Later, as a respected and knowledgeable antiquarian, he assisted American and French friends in acquiring furniture and treasures through his sources there. A man of strong opinions, great charm, and personal style, he is mourned by his many friends on both continents. Devoted Friends
