        PRISANT-Millard. On November 8, 2000, at his home in Roslyn Harbor, N.Y. after a brief illness. Adored husband of Carol Lincoff Prisant and father of Barden. Born in Albany, GA. on May 27, 1935 to Myron and Lillian Prisant, Millard Prisant graduated from Shady Side Academy in Pittsburgh, and Magna Cum Laude from Yale with a degree in Physics. He subsequently attended Harvard Business School, and in 1959 he was made part of the MIT team sent to Cape Canaveral to design and troubleshoot the Polaris missile guidance system. These were among the happiest years of his life, for he was truly one of the original rocket scientists. Mr. Prisant then went on to found Mod-A-Can, Inc., a firm which manufacturers aircraft indicator cases, with branches in New York, Arizona and New Jersey. But, he was not a just theoretician. His great pleasure was in restoring-with his own hands-historic houses. There was no plumbing, electrical or landscape challenge that was beyond his talents. He was President of the Roslyn Preseveation Corp., Chairman of the Roslyn Harbor Planning Board, and Past President of the Roslyn Landmark Society. His was Sabatini's line from Scaramouche, ''He was born with a gift of laughter, and a sense that the world was mad.'' It described him perfectly, but he had, as well, a gentle, sweet, and eternally boyish soul. He was loved greatly. Services will be held at Riverside Memorial Chapel, Amsterdam Ave and 75 St, in New York City at 1:15PM Friday, November 10th. Burial will be at the Roslyn Cemetery, Northern Blvd in Roslyn, following the service. Flowers may be sent to Riverside Memorial Chapel, or donations may be made in his name to a charity of one's choice.
