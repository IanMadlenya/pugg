        AUSTIN-Maurice. The Baruch community records with sorrow the passing of Maurice Austin, Class of '25, distinguished tax lawyer, scholar and dedicated alumnus. For much of his busy life he taught Baruch students the fine points of accountancy while also serving with distinction as an early member and Honorary Trustee of the Baruch College Fund. Mr. Austin's generous support to Baruch, bestowed through the J.M. Kaplan Fund, helped advance the reputation of the College and the education of many deserving students. We offer our deepest sympathy to his children, his grandchildren and Jennie Austin, his wife of seventyone years. He will be sorely missed. Edward V. Regan, President, Baruch College Lawrence Zicklin, President, The Baruch College Fund
