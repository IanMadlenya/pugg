        LOEB-Irving. We mourn the loss of a devoted friend and a kind and compassionate person. As a trustee of the Margaret and Elizabeth Winkler Foundation and as a Golden Founder together with his beloved wife Selma, his leadership and efforts at endowing Nursing Scholarships and equipment for the Department of Neonatology played a vital role in helping the mission of the ''Hospital with a Heart'' to heal the sick and ease the pain of the people of Jerusalem and Israel. We extend our condolences to Selma and sons Robert and Donald. May the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
