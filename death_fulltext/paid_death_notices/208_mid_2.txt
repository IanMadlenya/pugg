        CHWATT--Edward A. Today the world is a much sadder place after your passing. We are all much poorer because of our loss of you. At the same time, our lives have been enriched by our memories of you, which will endure for the rest of our lives. Your unequalled kindness, loyalty and generosity of spirit marked a unique friendship, lasting almost four decades, until your untimely death. Your exceptional ability as the ''consummate listener''-to help a loved one or friend feel that he or she was the only person in your world-was a source of immeasurable comfort that enriched all of us who were favored with your attention. Your warmth will stay with us always. Our deepest heartfelt condolences reach out to Sara, Mitchell and Sarah, Jill, Eric and Nancy, Samantha and Jimm, Richard and Robyn, and all the grandchildren. We will miss our dearest friend. Love, Sugar and Jerry and the Schrager Family
