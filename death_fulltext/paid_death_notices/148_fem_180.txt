        SHAPIRO-Roslyn Elgart. On May 25, 1999 in her 94th year. Loving mother of Jane Millstein and Donald and Arlene Shapiro. Proud grandmother of Rona and David Shapiro Franklin, Claudia and Harry Falk, Emma Morgan, Elizabeth Millstein, and Edward Shapiro. Adoring great grandmother of Noa Shapiro Franklin and Michael Heller Falk. For Ros, family was everything. May she rest in peace knowing how much she was loved by all of them.
        SHAPIRO-Roslyn. The community of West End Synagogue mourns the loss of this spunky lady who set an example for us all. Her son, Donald Shapiro our President, along with the rest of her family, gave her great and well-deserved nachas. May they all be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Rabbi Avi Winokur Associate Rabbi Yael B. Ridberg
