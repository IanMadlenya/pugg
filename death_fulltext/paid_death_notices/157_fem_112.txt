        RUDNICK-Pauline, M.D.. The faculty and staff of NYU School of Medicine mourn the passing of Pauline Rudnick, M.D., Clinical Professor of Psychiatry. Having practiced pediatrics for many years, she came in 1954 to Bellevue Hospital Center where she completed her residency in psychiatry. She joined the school's faculty in 1958 and gave decades of service in the Department of Psychiatry at Bellevue including directing it's Mental Hygiene Clinic from 1970-90. She subsequently served in the Student Health Service of NYU at Washington Square until 1999, all the while continuing to make contributions to the school through her lectures, supervision and membership on various committees. Her loss will be felt throughout the NYU community but her commitment to service and to her field will be long remembered. Robert M.
