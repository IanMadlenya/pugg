        LEVITT-Abraham, Hazzan. The Cantors Assembly records with sorrow the passing of a respected colleague of over four decades. A brilliant composer with a beautiful voice, he quietly and gently served the spiritual needs of his congregants with dignity, warmth and care. We extend our sympathy to his wife Lynne, to his family and loved ones. May his memory abide as a blessing. Hazzan Chaim Najman, President Hazzan Stephen J. Stein, Executive Vice President Hazzan Abraham B. Shapiro, Executive Administrator
