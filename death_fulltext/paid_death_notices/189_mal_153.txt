        RICE-Herbert. We mourn the passing of Herbert Rice, the father of our esteemed partner, Glenn B. Rice. Herbert Rice was a war hero and a man of integrity who had a zest for life. Our thoughts and sympathies are with Rhoda, Herbie's wife of 40 years, Glenn and his wife Daryle, Amy and Fred Gold, Susan and Rick Mosley, and Herbie's grandchildren, Nikki, Max, Jennifer and Stacy.
