        CARTER-Janet. The Trustees and staff of The Studio Museum in Harlem mourn the passing of one of our Trustees, Janet Carter, on April 25, 2000. Words cannot adequately express our loss for this wonderful, gracious woman who has been involved with our Museum from its inception. May God grant strength and comfort to her husband, Ron, her sons, Ron Jr. and Myles, and her family. Memorial services will be held on Saturday, April 29, 5-7 PM, on the 2nd fl. of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture located at 515 Malcolm X Blvd.(135 St).
