        FERRY-Carol Bernstein. The Board and Staff of The Correctional Association of New York mourn deeply the loss of their friend, colleague, and guide in the effort to create a just and humane society. Carol's intelligent insights and passionate beliefs were rare. Her courage in acting on them in life and in death were utterly unique. The world is a lesser place without her.

Her steady opposition to injustice will continue to inspire and strengthen us. Barbara H. Stanton, Chair Elizabeth Gaynes, Exec. Director
