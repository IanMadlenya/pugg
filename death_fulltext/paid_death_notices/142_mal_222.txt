        DARDIG-BEN. The Jewish Braille Institute of America is deeply saddened by the passing of a dear friend and highly respected professional colleague. As a consultant he contributed greatly to the enhancement of our services to the blind, visually impaired and reading disabled worldwide. To his loving wife Evelyn, his children and grandchildren we pray that they may be comforted in their loss. May his memory serve as a blessing. Barbara B. Friedman, President Dr. Jane Evans, Honoray President Gerald M. Kass, Executive V.P.
