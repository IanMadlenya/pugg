        COOK--Jean, M.D. Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University is profoundly saddened by the passing of its former associate dean of students and associate professor of medicine emeritus. He joined the Einstein faculty in 1958, and impressed colleagues as a dedicated physician with a sharp, keen intellect and gentle, dignified manner. For more than a decade, he also was a devoted dean of students whose wise counsel helped guide generations of future doctors to success. To friends, colleagues, and students he was known to be honest, sincere, and warm, and a great lover of music. His fair-minded, supportive approach always focused on the best interests of students, for whom he was always deeply concerned. He was much loved by all who knew him and he will be greatly missed.
