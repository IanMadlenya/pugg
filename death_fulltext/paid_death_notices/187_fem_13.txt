        PARODNECK-Pauline. Age 102. All of us at the Parodneck Foundation acknowledge with sorrow the passing of our friend and benefactor. We will miss Pauline, but as her late husband was fond of saying, ''When a person dies having lived a full and rich life, the event of their passing is an event to celebrate, not mourn.'' So in keeping with Meyer's advice we celebrate Pauline's life as a tribute to her life's work and in honor of her memory.
        PARODNECK-Pauline. United Neighborhood Houses (UNH) notes with sorrow the passing of our friend, Pauline Parodneck, wife of Meyer Parodneck, longtime UNH Board member.
