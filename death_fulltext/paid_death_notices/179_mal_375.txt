        DOWNES-Edward. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of Edward Downes, who was quiz master for the Texaco-Metropolitan Opera Saturday afternoon radio broadcasts for nearly 40 years. Generations of radio listeners came to love and admire this urbane gentleman, whose erudition and wit were always tempered by his gentle manner, great personal warmth, and deep humanity. We extend our sincerest sympathies to his sister Dorothy, his nieces and nephews, and his many friends. Joseph Volpe, General Manager James Levine, Artistic Director
