        DAVIES--Garland Hunter, 76, of Watch Hill, RI, and formerly of Atlanta, on November 17, at the Westerly Hospital, after a short illness. Widow of Nicholas Edward Davies, M.D., whom she married in 1950. She was born in NYC, raised in Rock Hill, SC, and after graduating from National Cathedral School and Sweet Briar College, lived for many happy years in Atlanta, where she was especially proud of being Dean of the Department of English as a Second Language at Georgia State University, from which she obtained her Masters in English. She traveled extensively with her husband and family, and frequently visited former students. She moved in 1998 full-time to Watch Hill, where, a member of the Misquamicut Club, she enjoyed golf and bridge with many new friends. She is survived by three children, Nicholas Davies of Manhattan; Elizabeth Davies Sanders of Wyndmoor, PA; and Sally Davies Halsey of Mystic, CT; and five grandchildren. Donations in her memory may be made to Sweet Briar College, PO Box G, Sweet Briar, VA 24592.
