        TOKATLIAN-Melik. On May 31, 2001. Died suddenly and quietly at home after being ill for some time. An astute businessman, he was responsible for developing a diamond stylii for the LP cartridge and manufactured diamond tools. In the late 1970's he successfully chaired a raffle committee to pay off the remaining mortgage on St. Vartan Cathedral in New York City. He was a loving, caring and very generous person who thought of others first, especially the family members. His loving wife, Florence, daughter, Linda, sons, John and Gary, grandchildren, Kristen and Derek, brother-inlaw, son-in-law and loving nieces Susan and Jill. In Greece his brother, sister, sister-in-law, nieces Christine and Florence. In Sao Paulo his nephews and nieces will miss him and love him always.
        TOKATLIAN-Melik. We consider ourselves privileged to have known Melik. A unique individual, a self-made successful businessman, blessed with a keen intellect and a warm, generous, attractive person. It was a pleasure just to be in his company. We will always remember him as he was before his illness, athletic, verbose, impeccably dressed and, at times, very funny. I was watching a Yankee game last night and thought of him. Much love, Anne and Mourad Nersesian
