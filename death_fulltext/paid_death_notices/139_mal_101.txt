        TORA-Shinichiro. Popular Photography Magazine's present and past staff celebrate the life of our teacher, friend, illustrator, and highly talented art director for over 35 years, who left us August 3 to be with the greatest artist of all. Graphic designer, photographer, lecturer, and inspirational advisor to generations of young Japanese artists trying to find their way in America, Mr. Tora, a graduate of Tokyo University, was a member of the Society of Illustrators, past director of the Art Directors Club, former chairman of the Japanese Graphic Design Exhibition, and present director of the JapaneseAmerican Association. There were many exhibitions of his work, including shows at the Art Directors Club, the Japanese Advertising Photographers Association, and the International Art Directors Exhibition in Beijing, China. He was a regular contributing writer to Idea magazine since 1974. Among over his 100 honors, manyfor graphics in Popular Photography, were the Art Director Club Gold Awards in 1974, 1980, and 1986, plus several awards from the Society of Illustrators. Brave and gallant, he was with us as long as he could move his pencil or click his mouse. He is survived by his wife, Mie to whom we extend our deepest sympathies. A memorial service will be held at a future date at the Japanese-American Association, 15 West 44th Street in Manhattan.
