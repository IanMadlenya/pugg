        LESLIE-Stephen H., M.D. We mourn the loss of Dr. Stephen Leslie, an alumnus of our School of Medicine and Associate Professor of Clinical Medicine. He was a dedicated, loyal alumnus and a longtime highly devoted, caring attending physician at Bellevue who pioneered our Intermediate Care Unit and served with distinction for many years as a clinician, teacher and administrator. He was committed to total high quality care for all. We express our sympathy to his spouse, Lillian, and to his children and grandchildren. Saul J. Farber, M.D. M.A.C.P. The Frederick H.
