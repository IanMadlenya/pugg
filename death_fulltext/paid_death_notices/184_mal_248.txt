        LORD-Walter. The trustees of the South Street Seaport Museum wish to celebrate the life of Walter Lord, consummate friend and Museum supporter for the 35 years since our founding. Scholar, author of ''A Night To Remember'' and numerous other best-selling histories, teacher, collector, ocean liner enthusiast, and the always perfect gentleman, Walter Lord set an example of integrity and generosity of spirit for us all. We will miss his thoughtful encouragement, gentle wit, and strength of body, mind, and purpose. Lawrence S. Huntington, Chrmn. Peter Neill, President
