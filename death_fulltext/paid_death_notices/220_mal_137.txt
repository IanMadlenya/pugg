        KURTZ--Norman D. Norm will be profoundly missed. No matter the number of years that we had him, they were too few. He was a great husband, father, athlete, intellect and engineer. His friends, either close or casual, will know that I have not overstated either his devotion to his family or his talents. He also was my great friend of 51 years. My wife Carol, and I, along with our children extend our love and heartfelt condolences to Honey, Lori, Stephanie, Barry and Judy. We deeply mourn his loss. Irwin, Carol, Ronnie and Suzanne Silverberg
