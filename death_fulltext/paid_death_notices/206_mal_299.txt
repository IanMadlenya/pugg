        HATFIELD--Robert S. Died peacefully at home in Greenwich, CT. Sunday March 14, 2004. We are all deeply saddened. An icon in business, but first he was a husband and father always there when we needed him. He gave tirelessly to make this world a better place. The words that he lived by and passed on through so many: ''Where ever you are standing in life, when you turn to leave that spot make sure you leave it better then when you found with a simple word or deed.'' This way of life was evidenced with his work with New York-Presbyterian Hospital and the National Executive Service Corp. He was the ''Wind Beneath Our Wings''. A private Family service was held at the Round Hill Community Church, Greenwich. A scholarship fund has been started in his honor. Memorial contributions can be made to the: Robert S. Hatfield Scholarship Fund at Cornell, C/O Inga, 303 Day Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853. Love From Your Family Mrs. Roberta S.
