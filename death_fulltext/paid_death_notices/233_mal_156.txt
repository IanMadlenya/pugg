        SUN--Alexander S., he was a beloved father and scientist who dedicated his life to saving the lives of others. Born in 1939 in Hunan, China, Alexander Shikuan Sun survived the invasion of China during WWII. Alexander completed his college education in Taiwan and moved to the U.S. to receive his Ph.D. at the University of California at Berkeley. With the mentorship of Nobel Laureate, Dr. Melvin Calvin, Alexander excelled in the field of photosynthesis and later as a postdoc under the guidance of Nobel Laureate Christian de Duv. Alexander was a pioneer in the study of aging for more than 15 years as a faculty member at Mount Sinai Hospital and continued his research at Yale University School of Medicine. When his mother was diagnosed with inoperable Stage IV lung cancer and given 6 months to live, Alexander invented his Selected Vegetable Herbal Soup that allowed his mother to live an additional 17 years. Through the advancement and development of his company, Sun Farm Corporation, Alexander has aided cancer patients around the world. His dream of achieving approval from the FDA for his product was almost realized before his passing. Today, his dream of fully developing the first nontoxic treatment for cancer continues. He is survived by his brother and sister, nephew, niece, wife, and two sons who are determined to sustain what they hope to be his enduring legacy. A funeral will be held at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel at 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street at 1pm on Friday, June 16. There will be a Memorial Service at the Sun home at 500 Anderson Ave., Milford, CT at 1pm on Saturday, June 17th. Donations can be made to the American Heart Association.
