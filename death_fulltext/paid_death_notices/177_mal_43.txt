        MINTZ-Nathan, M.D. The Association of the Attending Staff of the Mount Sinai Hospital mourns the passing of our long-standing colleague, teacher and friend. Dr. Mintz began his association with Mount Sinai in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology in 1934. After receiving additional training in Pathology, he devoted the next 60 years to clinical teaching and to the superb practice of medicine in OB/GYN. He will be fondly remembered for his warmth and compassion, and for his traditional bedside manner. He was loved by his patients and respected by his colleagues. The AAS salutes Dr. Mintz's outstanding commitment to Mount Sinai and his many years of service. We extend our sincere condolences to his family.
