        RUDICK -- Patricia. The friends of P.S. 169 mourn the loss of our dear friend and colleague. Her devotion to the cause of literacy and learning, together with her kindness and compassion for our children, inspired us. She will be remembered always when we read with the children she loved so much. The Board of Directors, The Friends of P.S. 169
