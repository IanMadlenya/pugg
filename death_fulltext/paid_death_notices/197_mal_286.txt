        ALTMAN--Edwin J. On June 24, 2003 at age 90. Beloved husband of Glen, cherished father of Pat Falkenberg, Ginny Aaron and Tracy Warner. Dear father-in-law of Edward Falkenberg, Roger Aaron and Greg Warner. Loving grandfather of Chris, Kai and Merrill Falkenberg, Peter and Todd Aaron, Haley and Amanda Warner and greatgrandfather of Talia. He was a man of sharp mind with a commanding grasp of history and quick sense of humor. A keen business sense, always tempered by his fairness and integrity, earned him the admiration and affection of colleagues in the jewelry business for over 65 years, and the love of those with whom he worked closely. A raconteur who truly enjoyed people, he personified the glamour of New York throughout his life. His charm, his innate kindness, his smile, his unconditional love will be sorely missed and long remembered.
        ALTMAN--Edwin J. The staff of M. B. Altman Sons mourn the passing of our beloved employer. His knowledge and leadership guided us, his wisdom informed us and his friendship brought us joy. We will miss him greatly. >>AD#
