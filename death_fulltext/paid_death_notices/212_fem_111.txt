        CURTIN -- Bernadette Mur phy. Bernadette, or Murph as you probably knew her has lost her heroic fight against her mortal enemy, the disease known as Multiple Sclerosis. Just as she wished her tired and tortured body has been turned over to the medical scientists in their fight against this terrible disease. Service will be confined to a Memorial Mass to be celebrated at 11 AM on Friday, September 17, 2004 at the St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church in Bronxville, NY. We will sing no sad songs Nor shall we weep But rejoice that she is resting at peace In the loving arms of her Lord. Remember her as we do Always with a smile And constantly in your prayers.
