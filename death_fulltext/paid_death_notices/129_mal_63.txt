        LEMELSON-Jerome H. The Board of Trustees, President David C. Chang, the faculty, students and alumni of Polytechnic University profoundly regret the passing of Jerome H. Lemelson, one of the world's most prolific and courageous inventors and a hero to all who follow in his footsteps. Mr. Lemelson, a graduate of New York University's School of Engineering, which was absorbed by Polytechnic in 1973, held a 1995 honorary degree from Polytechnic for being ''the incomparable entrepreneur of our high-technology age'' and for his unstinting support of creativity and innovation as key values for American education and business. Mr. Lemelson's patent portfolio will be second only to that of Thomas A. Edison as the nation's most prolific inventor. The Dorothy and Jerome Lemelson Foundation he established is devoted to raising public consciousness about the importance of inventors and preventing their exploitation. The Lemelson National Program supports, among many causes, the Hands-On Science Center at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. Our heartfelt condolences go to his wife, Dorothy; two sons, Eric and Robert; two brothers, Howard and Justin, and two grandchildren.
