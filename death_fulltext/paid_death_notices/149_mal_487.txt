Bloom, M.D., Associate Clinical Professor Emeritus in the Department of Otolaryngology, who was associated with Mount Sinai for more than six decades. Dr. Bloom joined Mount Sinai as an Intern in 1935 and was appointed a Clinical Assistant upon completion of his Residency in 1939. During his long career in clinical practice and teaching, he served Mount Sinai in numerous capacities that advanced our mission of excellence in patient care and medical education. Recognized by and active in many organizations devoted to his specialty, Dr. Bloom was a Fellow of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, the American College of Surgeons, the American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, and the New York Academy of Medicine, an Associate of the American College of Allergists, and Treasurer and a member of the Executive Committee of the American Academy of Facial, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. He will be remembered fondly not only for his achievements, but also for his devotion and personal warmth, and he will be sorely missed. We extend our sincere condolences to his wife, Zita, to his children Lloyd and Betty, to his grandchildren, and to the entire family. Stephen M. Peck, Chairman John W. Rowe, M.D., President Arthur H. Rubenstein, MBBCh, Dean Barry R. Freedman, Executive Vice President Theresa A. Bischoff, Executive Vice President Joel Bauer, M.D., President, Medical Board
