        QUILTY-Dan. The entire NYU community mourns the passing of its beloved and esteemed longtime athletic director. His relationship with the University lasted some fifty years, beginning as a student who played on the highly regarded NYU basketball squads of the late 1940's and culminating in his long tenure as athletic director. He was a key developer of the University's current athletic facilities and programs, and he was an originator of the University Athletic Association, the league in which NYU now plays. He always worked to elicit achievement from his athletes, emphasizing scholarship ahead of athletics. He dedicated his professional life to this institution and its students, and his spirit, friendship and presence will be sorely missed. L. Jay Oliva, President Martin Lipton, Chairman
