        ARNOLD - Regina. Sarah Lawrence College mourns the loss of Regina Arnold, Associate Dean of Studies and, for 21 years, a Professor of Sociology at the College. A staunch advocate of experimental learning, Dr. Arnold was noted for her ability to engage students in dialogue and to help them to design meaningful research projects. She inspired and advanced the College's program of field work and service learning. Her efforts to forge connections between Sarah Lawrence and the local community made a lasting impact on the College. She was a deeply loved and admired member of the College community. We extend our deepest sympathy to her family. Michele Tolela Myers, President Barbara Kaplan, Dean of the College
