        ROTH-Flora. Died peacefully on February 2, 1999, after a long battle with lung disease, blindness and other health problems. She was a feisty and independent 84 years old. Born in Chicago, IL, the only child of Louis and Frieda Freiman, she followed in her father's footsteps and started acting in the Yiddish theater while still in her teens. Her career in and commitment to the theater were centerpieces of her life. While she began her dramatic work in the Yiddish Theater, she had her own Yiddish radio show in the 1940s and continued to act in off Broadway productions, movies and television commercials until she was 80 years old. She was an active member of the Hebrew Actors Union. In 1947 Flora married Murray Roth, who died in 1970. They had two children: David Roth, a world-class coin magician, and Lisa Roth, a graphic artist and social activist. Flora overcame adversity with a smile, a spectacular sense of humor and undaunted optimism. Her personal philosophy was ''life is wonderful''-but she said it in Yiddish. She possessed a joy for living and a gift for laughter. She loved people, and everyone loved her back. She leaves behind her two children; her nephews, nieces, grand nephews and grand nieces; her 99-year-old Uncle Sol and his wife Elizabeth; and a vast collection of friends, neighbors, healthcare providers and acquaintances who all loved her. The passing of our wonderful mother leaves a tremendous void in our lives-we miss her already. A private celebration of Flora's life will be held in the spring. Please call 212-475-1614 and leave a brief message if you wish to be notified or if you wish to speak at the celebration.
