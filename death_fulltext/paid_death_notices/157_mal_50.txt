        MILANO-Robert L. Sam Walter Foss' tender epitaph from the late 19th Century reappears as we bid farewell to our beloved Daytop Governor, Bob Milano: ''Let me live in my house by the side of the road and be a friend to man!''. And a Friend, indeed, he has been for a quarter-century to captive generations of this Town's young caughtup in the web of drug abuse and successfully seeking freedom through Daytop Village. May the bright sunshine of Heaven welcome him home. And may our prayerful support be felt by his beloved Sidonia and Robert and the Milano Family. Msgr. William B. O'Brien President, Daytop Village, Inc.
