        BERNSTEIN--Harold. The Tel Aviv Foundation wishes to express its heartfelt condolences to Helen and family for the loss of your beloved husband, father, and grandfather, a man of tzedekah and vision. Harold, our partner, a man who truly believed that education is the best tool for the advancement of all societies. The state of Israel is one of the beneficiaries of Harold's vision, he was the first to donate computers for kindergartens in Tel Aviv and establish a multi-media and learning center in the Tel Chai school, where the majority of the students are underprivileged. Harold inspired all who knew him, he was one of a kind. We will miss him and cherish him in our hearts forever. Mayor Ron Huldai, Admiral (res.) Abraham Ben-Shoshan, The Board of The Tel Aviv Foundation, Meggie Navon, Caryn Rosenberg and the children of Tel Aviv-Jaffa
