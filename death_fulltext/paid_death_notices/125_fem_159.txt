        HAWKEY-Sr. Eileen, S.C. The Board of Trustees, Sisters of Charity, Medical Staff, Hospital Auxiliary, Administration and the entire family of St. Vincents Hospital and Medical Center mourn the loss of our beloved friend and colleague, Sr. Eileen, a cherished member of the Hospital staff for over 40 years. Sr. Eileen formerly had been Director of Nursing and Director of Purchasing at St. Vincents and continued to manage the purchasing department until her death. In 1995 she was honored with the St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Award. She was known for her extraordinary warmth, her lively wit, and her unending devotion to her family, the Sisters of Charity and St. Vincents. Her enthusiasm and vitality inspired us all. She will long and most affectionately be remembered. With great sadness we extend our prayers and condolences to her family. Thomas A. Coleman, Chairman of the Board Karl P. Adler, M.D. President, Chief Executive Officer Eduardo M. Gonzalez, M.D. President of the Medical Staff
