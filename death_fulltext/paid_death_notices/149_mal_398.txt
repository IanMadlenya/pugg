        WASSERMAN-Louis R. The faculty members of the Samuel Bronfman Department of Medicine of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine and the Mount Sinai Hospital of Mount Sinai NYU Health profoundly mourn the passing of our esteemed colleague, Dr. Louis R. Wasserman. Dr. Wasserman was a true giant among giants in the grand Mount Sinai tradition. As one of the founders of the subspecialty of Hematology in the United States, he was President of the American Society of Hematology and led the Polycythemia Vera Study Group, which made seminal contributions to the treatment of this disorder. Dr. Wasserman's powerful leadership made Mount Sinai a national leader in Hematology and established a rich tradition that continues to the present. He trained and mentored many of the leaders in Hematology throughout the world to carry on his rich legacy. We extend our sincere condolences to his wife, Julia, and to his entire family. Barry S. Coller, M.D., Chairman
