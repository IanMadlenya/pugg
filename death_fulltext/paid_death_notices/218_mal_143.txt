        DAVIS--Glenn. The Heisman Trophy family mourns the loss of Glenn Davis. He was a valued friend to everyone associated with the Trophy, and his presence will be deeply missed. Ever since his Heisman winning season of 1946 the Trophy could count on Glenn's support for all of its endeavors, and for that we are truly thankful. Our hearts also go out to his wife Yvonne and to all the members of the Davis family. Never again will collegiate football see another one like ''Mr. Outside''.
