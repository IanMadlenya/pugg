        ACKERMAN-Pearl. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Dr. Jacob Ackerman on the loss of his beloved mother. A Silver Founder of the medical center together with his late wife Elaine, herself an active member of the National Woman's Division, Dr. Ackerman learned the highest values and ethics of Judaism from his mother. May Jacob and the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. American Committee for Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem
