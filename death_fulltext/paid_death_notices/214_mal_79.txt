        CREAGHAN--George B. was taken to his rest today by those who loved him, his magnificent wife Ellen, his son Dennis, daughters Patricia and Georgina, son-law-law Mark Tillinger and brother and sister-in-law Charles and Phyllis Ponsford. Mr. Creaghan, an entreprenuer, was born in London, England in 1909 and emigrated to the United States in 1953. In World War II, during the many months of the bombing of London, he served in the Air Raid Precautions Division. He faced this heavy and dangerous work with composure and fortitude as night after night he rescued the living and recovered the dead. He succumbed to Alzheimer's Disease Saturday, November 6th, 2004 after waging a long and gallant fight over the last 10 years. God have mercy on his soul.
