        REAGAN--President Ronald. Florence D'Urso and her family mourn the loss of a great man and dear friend, our nation's beloved president, Ronald W. Reagan. His optimism and vision made our world a richer place; and his love of God and country set a beautiful example. We will be forever grateful to that courageous man of character for freeing us from communism, and making us proud, once again, to be Americans. Ronald Reagan will be deeply missed; but his charisma, his graciousness and his winning smile will never be forgotten. Our heartfelt sympathy, love and prayers go to his family and his beloved wife, Nancy.
