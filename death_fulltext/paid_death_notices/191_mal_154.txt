        STERN-Irving. Of Manhattan. On December 15, 2002, in his 88th year, passed peacefully in his sleep. He will be deeply missed by his wife of 63 years Evelyn; three sons and their families; Herbert and Susan, Martin and Susan, and Barrett and Marjorie; and grandchildren Jayme, Dana and Rebecca...and countless people he helped or did business with over the course of his years. He was the father of the late Daniel Stern and grandfather to the late Andrew Stern. A self-made, creative businessman in textiles, and a leader in his field, he lent a helping hand or opportunity to so many persons around him, as evidenced by the strength of the lifelong relationships with his extended family, friends, customers, suppliers, and employees whose lives he touched. He was a tower of strength and lived with integrity, responsibility and honesty. He made us proud to be Americans and of our Jewish heritage. Services will be held at Riverside Chapel, 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, at 1 PM, on Monday, December 16th. Shiva will be Monday and Tuesday at Barrett Stern's home, and Wednesday and Thursday at Herbert Stern's home.
