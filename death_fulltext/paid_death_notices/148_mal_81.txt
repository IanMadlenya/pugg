        LIVERANT-Jacob. We extend our sincerest condolences to Alex Liverant and Dorothy Goldberg on the loss of their beloved father. Mr. Liverant, together with his wife, Dina, were devoted friends and Golden Founders of the Medical Center. They will always be remembered for their generous support and kind efforts on behalf of the healthcare needs of Klal Yisrael. May the warm and loving memories of the special individual brings solace to the entire family and may they be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
