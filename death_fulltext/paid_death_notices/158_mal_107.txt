        GRAYSON-Stanley. We are deeply saddened by the death of our great friend, former Executive Director who, for over 20 years, guided our Foundation with devotion and elegance, and Honorary Board member since his retirement. His relationship with our supporters strengthened our activities both here and in Israel. His love for chess motivated his wonderful family to create a permanent scholarship for a talented Israeli chess player. Our fondest thoughts go to his wife, daughter, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. On behalf of the Board of the America-Israel Cultural Foundation, Vera Stern, President Ralph Tornberg, Meira Geyra
