        WARD--Christian Scott, 59, native of Boise, Idaho, and resident of (and lover of) NYC since attending Columbia College in 1965. He died November 22, after a mercifully brief struggle with advanced lung cancer. (Yes, he'd smoked, but not for 25 years.) He was an extraordinary man, a loving father, husband and friend. A gifted writer with a gentle wit, wise counsel, and a love of storytelling. Husband of Francine Russo, father of Justin, Lindsey, and Brennan Ward, his children by his late wife Virginia Marcellino Ward, and step-father of Sara Russo Dogan and Joanna Russo. We lost him too soon, and we mourn him terribly. Funeral services, Sunday, November 26th, 11AM, Riverside Memorial Chapel, Amsterdam Ave. and 76th St. Please do not send flowers. Our cats will eat them.
