        FORSDALE-C. Louis. Professor Emeritus of Communication and Education at Teachers College, Columbia University died at age 77 of a heart attack in St. Joseph's Hospital in Albuquerque, N.M. on Sept. 22. A gifted and compassionate teacher, scholar of the impact of mass communications on the future of the human condition, lyrical photographer, astute analyst of film as an art form, lover of Mozart, Suzanne Farrell and Emily Dickinson, Lou influenced the lives and the classrooms of hundreds of graduate students and countless colleagues with his selfless generosity of spirit and imagination. He devoutly believed in the highest potential of his students and was rarely disappointed. In the early 70's, Lou introduced a professor from the University of Toronto by the name of Marshall McLuhan to media cogniscenti in NYC. McLuhan's observation that electronic communications were creating a ''global village'' reinforced Lou's own theories including the understanding that the visual impact of mass media far exceeded the importance of the text. His students have worked with educational systems throughout the country to place the arts at the core of educational curricula. Lou leaves behind his cherished children John Forsdale of Sante Fe and Lynn Denny and grandsons Oliver, Morgan and Cooper Denny of Lamy, N.M. The Department of Arts and Humanities and the Teachers College Community mourn the loss of Louis Forsdale. A memorial service in Milbank Chapel at Teachers College is planned for 4:00pm, Sunday, November 7.
