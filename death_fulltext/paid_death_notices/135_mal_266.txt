        BEDIN-Emeric J., 77. Passed away April 22, 1998 in the loving warmth of his wife, daughter and son after a courageous battle with cancer. Born Oct. 18, 1920 in Rockford, IL, son of Girolamo & Angela. His youth was spent in Brendola, Italy and returned to Rockford in 1928 through Ellis Island. After his retirement in 1980 from the City of Rockford with 34 years of service, he spent most of his time in Italy, and in New York City where his daughter Janet lives. Emeric was a U.S. Army World War II hero landing in Normandy and was interviewed by WABC-TV in 1995 for carrying out his battle with cancer like a military operation, ''he just wouldn't give up.'' When he was hit with a piece of shrapnel in France he didn't fall down, he just kept on fighting for which he received the Purple Heart and many other medals. Emeric said, ''You were taught to outfox your enemy, that is what I did in the war and that is what I'll do with my cancer.'' The family would like to thank the doctors who believed in Emeric's valiant fight and to not give up on him because of a terminal illness & to those he convinced he was a warrior with every comeback defying the odds. The battle ended 2 years beyond the statistics; his spirit won and lives on. Emeric's legacy in battling cancer are in the following: ''We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight in the landing grounds, we shall never surrender''. (Churchill, 1940). Survivors include his wife Dolores, son Alexander of Rockford and daughter Janet Bedin of NYC, all of whom will miss and love him dearly. Funeral services 10:30 am, April 30, St. Anthony Church in Rockford. Visitation from 6-8 PM, April 29 at the Olson Funeral Chapel, 2811 N. Main Street, Rockford, Il. In lieu of flowers, memorials may be given to the family.
