        ROTHMAN-Frank. The partners, attorneys and staff of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP express our heartfelt condolences upon the passing of our partner, colleague and friend, Frank Rothman. He was a giant amongst us. Frank was a valued mentor to his partners and colleagues, and a sage and loyal advisor to his clients. We will sorely miss his strength, leadership, grace, wisdom, bonhomie and charm. Our thoughts are with his wife Mariana and family.
        ROTHMAN-Frank. Frank, you were a father and a mentor. S. G.
