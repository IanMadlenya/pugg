        HIRSCH--George. The officers, staff, participants, members and friends of AHRC, convey their deepest condolences to the family of George Hirsch. Having served as a member of the Board of Directors, Chairman of a range of committees with particular focus on matters of finance, George was for decades a pillar of the Association. His commitment, integrity, generosity of spirit and clear sense of purpose helped to guide us as Board Member, President, and President of our State Association. Few have given as much. He will be deeply missed. Our prayers go out to George and to his children Marlene, Josh and Fern, and their families. George Hirsch was unique and irreplaceable. He was a true and early member of the AHRC family. We celebrate his role as one of our most enduring founders. Genevieve O'Neil, President Michael Goldfarb, Exec. Dir.
