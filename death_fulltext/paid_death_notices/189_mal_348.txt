        WELLSTONE-Senator Paul. On behalf of the Board and Staff of NARAL, we express our sadness as we mourn the loss of Sen. Paul Wellstone, a champion of women's rights and a courageous public advocate for Minnesotans, Americans and citizens of the world. Throughout his years of service in the United States Senate, he never wavered from his commitment to ensuring justice and defending the interests of everyday Americans. The Senator embodied a combination of integrity and steadfastness of principle that are all too rare in today's political arena. We hope that others in public service will strive to carry on his dedication to those in need.
