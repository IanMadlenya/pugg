        ALBERTINE - Margaret. A true American beauty, died at home on Friday, February 7, after a long and courageous battle with breast cancer. Her physical beauty was only surpassed by her passion for social justice and her love for animals. A lawyer and an expert on Arabian-Egyptian horses, she was an ardent advocate for the environment and animal rights. She was also a collector of equine art. Intellectually brilliant, she was an honor graduate of Douglas College of Rutgers University and Syracuse Law School where she wrote for Law Review. Margaret is survived by her mother, Elsie F. Albertine, a brother, Michael O. Albertine, a sister Julie A. Levin, and three nephews, Michael J. Albertine, Stephen C. Albertine, and Aaron V. Levin. A memorial service will be held at the B'Nai Shalom Synagogue on 300 Pleasant Valley Way, in West Orange, Sunday, February 23, 2003, at 10:15 A.M.
