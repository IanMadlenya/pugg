        DiVIRGILIO-Daniel F. Riverdale Country School extends its deepest sympathies to the family and friends of Daniel F. DiVirgilio, who suffered a fatal heart attack on Thursday, November 22, 2001. The Director of Lower School Admission for the past year and a half, Dan was a ''school man'' in the best sense of that phrase. An educator who made a difference in the lives of those who knew him, Dan was bringing the same sense of dedication and love to Riverdale Country School that made him a legendary figure at Hackley School, where, for fourteen years, he served as Director of the Lower School. Dan made a powerful and positive impact on the School community, and he will be sorely missed. Our thoughts and prayers reach out to his wife, Maris Kastan, and to the other members of his family. Richard S. Zinman, Chairman John R. Johnson, Headmaster
