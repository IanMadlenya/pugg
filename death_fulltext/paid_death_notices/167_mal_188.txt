        LIEBOWITZ-Jack. The officers and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Jack Liebowitz, whose life embodied the world of our values and the compassion of our mission. As the comic-book publisher who turned Superman and Batman into household names, Mr. Liebowitz was a superhero himself. He was a board member of one of our predecessor organizations, the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York, & a founding trustee and president of our beneficiary, Long Island Jewish Hospital, now North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System. For 50 years, he gave of himself unstintingly and unselfishly to the Long Island community and to communities worldwide. Our deepest sympathies go to his wife, Shirley; his daughters, Joan Levy and Linda Stillman; his stepson, Robert Schwartz; his many grandchildren & great-grandchildren; and the entire family. May all who benefited from Jack's kindness and wisdom be consoled among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. James S. Tisch, President Larry Zicklin, Board Chair John S. Ruskay, Exec VP & CEO LIEBOWITZ-Jack. It is with the deepest sorrow that we mourn the passing of Jack Liebowitz, a Founding Trustee, a past President of the Board of Trustees of Long Island Jewish Medical Center and a Trustee and Honorary Chairman of the Board of the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System. For fifty years, he unselfishly gave of himself for the benefit of the community and the hospital he loved. Without his guidance, generosity and inspiration, LIJ would not have developed into one of the pre-eminent medical centers in this region. Our most sincere condolences are extended to his entire family. John S.T. Gallagher, CEO Roy J. Zuckerberg, Chairman, Board of Trustees North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System
