        GALBRAITH--John Kenneth. It is with deep sorrow that the American Academy of Arts and Sciences mourns the passing of John Kenneth Galbraith. With a towering intellect, sharp wit, voracious curiosity, and gentle manner, he left his mark on the academic community, on international affairs, and on the public conscience. From Cambridge to Washington to India, he informed and influenced students, political leaders, and all those who sought insight from his lucid and prolific writings. Friend, neighbor, and active Fellow of the Academy for over fifty years, he was proof of his own adage: ''The spirit should never grow old.'' The Academy extends its sincere condolences to his wife and our dear friend, Kitty, and to his family. We shall miss his presence among us. Patricia Meyer Spacks President Louis W. Cabot Vice President and Chair of the Academy Trust John S. Reed, Treasurer Jerrold Meinwald, Secretary Leslie C. Berlowitz, Chief Executive Officer
