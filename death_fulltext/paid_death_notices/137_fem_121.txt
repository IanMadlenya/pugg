        JONES-Lois Mailou. The Board and Staff of The Studio Museum in Harlem mourn the passing of the extraordinary painter, Lois Mailou Jones. Ms. Jones was a significant figure in American art in her own right and was a teacher and mentor to many other outstanding artists. We are privileged to have Ms. Jones's work in the Museum's collection and to have featured her work in the recent exhibition ''Explorations in the City of Light.'' Her legacy of creativity, grace and dignity and a prodigious body of work will continue to inspire new generations. We offer our sincere condolences to her nephew, Robert Jones and to all her family. George L. Knox, Chairman Kinshasha Holman Conwill Director
