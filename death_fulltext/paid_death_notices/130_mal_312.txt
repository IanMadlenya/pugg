        BERMAN-Philip I. The Jewish Publication Society records with great sorrow the passing of our life trustee and benefactor. Together with his dear wife, our past president Dr. Muriel M. Berman, he supported our publication program through the creation of the Philip and Muriel Berman Endowment. Over the past two decades, some of our most significant, award winning publications were made possible through their generosity. They include Jewish Law, Ketubbah, and The Invisible Thread. Philip Berman's passion made possible the JPS contribution to sustaining the tradition of ''The People of the Book.'' May his memory be for a blessing.
