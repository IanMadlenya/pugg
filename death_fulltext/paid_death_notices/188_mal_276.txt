        ROGENSTEIN - Bernard. With deep affection and in profound sadness we mourn the sudden loss of our friend Bernie Rogenstein. He was a true gentleman, a connoisseur of life; unselfish, kind, gregarious and just fun to be around. We looked forward to our weekly tennis matches and never ceased to learn from his fundamental decency, good judgment and sportsmanship. We will miss him very much. Artie, Jeff, Jim, Mike B., Mike W. and Steve
