The entire St. Luke's - Roosevelt Hospital Center family joins with the leadership of its parent company, Continuum Health Partners, in acknowledging with sadness the passing of our beloved friend and benefactor, Henry Born. Together with his late sister Mildred, they established the Born Critical Care Unit at Roosevelt Hospital in memory of their parents. In addition, they endowed a major fund to support cardiac research, and Henry generously supported the Hospital's clinical and research efforts in hepatobiliary and pancreatic medicine. Henry will be greatly missed by all who knew and loved him. To his family and friends, we extend heartfelt condolences. Morton P.
