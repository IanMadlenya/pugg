        COOPERSTEIN--Sam, painter, art director, father of two and grandfather of three died on February 8. He was 70 years old. Son of Morris and Jean Cooperstein, older brother to Steven Cooperstein and Bryna Cohen, his spirit and humor will live on through those whose lives he touched. A lover of the museums of New York City, he also enjoyed walking the beach in Fire Island, and was an avid painter throughout his life. He spent the last year of his life in Cooperstown, New York, and is survived by his son, Adam, daughter, Emily, and grandchildren Jason, William and Abigail. He will be sorely missed.
