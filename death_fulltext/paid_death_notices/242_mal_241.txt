Hugh Martin writes of Timothy, '' You were the best witting partner I ever had, and working with you was emotional and visceral, a truly synergistic phenomenon. Looking back at the finished product, it is difficult at times to distinguish between your work and mine. The name Timothy Gray is not a household word. But in my personal Pantheon, it is a name that lights up the sky with laughter, lyricism and love.''
