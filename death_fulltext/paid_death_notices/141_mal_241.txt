        SUSLOW-Robert J. The Directors, Trustees and staff of National Jewish Medical & Research Center in Denver express their sincerest condolences to the Suslow family and the many friends of Robert J. Suslow. Mr. Suslow also was a long standing member of The National Jewish Council of National Trustees. In this capacity, he was a major leader in the annual retail industry dinners in New York. Mr. Suslow's long association with and support of National Jewish did much to assist in the treatment and research of lung, allergic and immune system diseases at the center. In 1980, when Mr. Suslow received The National Jewish Humanitarian Award, the event in his honor drew more than 2,000 friends and business associates. The event established the Robert J. Suslow Fellowship in Environmental Lung Disease. A major supporter of National Jewish Medical & Research Center in Denver, other charitable organizations, and the retail and fashion industries, Mr. Suslow was liked and admired by all those with whom he interacted. Family, friends and business associates will truly miss his leadership and friendship. Robert L. Mettler, Chairman Council of National Trustees Lynn M. Taussig, M.D., President & CEO
