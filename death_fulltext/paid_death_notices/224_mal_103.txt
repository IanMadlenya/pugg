        McKAY--Dean. IBM's first and longtime Vice President of Communications, died September 6, 2005, in Greenwich, CT, of lung cancer, said his son Brian McKay. He was 83. Shortly after Thomas J. Watson Jr. became President and CEO of IBM in 1956, he reorganized the company in anticipation of its probable explosive growth following the introduction of computers. Mr. McKay was put in charge of Communications, responsible for press relations, advertising, internal communications and special events. Mr. McKay was also responsible for IBM's pioneering corporate design program. The company had to make the difficult transformation from an electromechanical company, long well known for its punch card accounting machines, to a leader in the new electronic computer era. A World War II U.S. Navy veteran, Mr. McKay served in the Pacific as a Japanese language translator and interpreter with an intelligence unit of General MacArthur's headquarters. Dean Raymond McKay was born November 13, 1921, in Seattle. He attended public schools in Seattle and was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the University of Washington. He also attended the advanced management program at Harvard Business School. He was a senior vice-president of IBM and a retired member of the Board of Directors of IBM, Conoco, Dupont, MCI, Marsh McLennan, and Nabisco. He is survived by two sons, Brian McKay of Reno, NV, a former Attorney General of the State of Nevada and his wife, Karen; Bruce McKay, a television producer of Garden City, NY, and his wife, Traceyann; and four grandchildren.
