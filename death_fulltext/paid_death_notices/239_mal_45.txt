        SURKS--Sylvan, M.D. (Nathan) December 1, 2006. The Held family mourns the passing of their beloved uncle Sy. He had a profound influence on the lives of his nephews and will be remembered for his love, intelligence and sense of humor. As a pioneer in the field of Anesthesiology, Dr. Surks was a mentor to countless numbers of anesthesiologists and surgeons. His ability to teach and instill his love of medicine in others has shaped a generation of physicians. He will be missed by all who knew him. Our hearts are with Aunt Harriet, Dena, Laura and Ron.
