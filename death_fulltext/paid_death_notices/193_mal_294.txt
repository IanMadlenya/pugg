        MERTON-Robert K. It is with great sorrow that the American Academy of Arts and Sciences mourns the death of Robert K. Merton, distinguished sociologist, recipient of the Academy's Talcott Parsons Prize in the Social Sciences, and a Fellow of this society for over a half-century. Professor Merton devoted a lifetime to expanding our understanding of human actions and motives in works that combined historical penetration, analytic rigor, deep psychological insight, and an uncommon interest in all fields of knowledge. On his shoulders, much of the innovative thinking of twentiethcentury sociology has been built. The Academy extends its condolences to his wife, Harriet Zuckerman, and his son, Robert C. Merton-both Fellows of the Academyand to his entire family.
