        APFEL-Sadye. ''Honey'' to her grandchildren, wife of the late Murray D. Apfel, matriarch of the family, took ill while vacationing and died in Southampton Hospital, four months shy of her 100th birthday. After an automobile accident 14 years ago, she defied all odds and lived with a spinal cord injury, while her devoted Blossom and Stanley and Christy gave her life. She never ever made demands, but earned the love and devotion of all her great grandchildren: Morgan Van Dorn, Lindsay, Andrew and Matthew Schaeffer; and her grandchildren who worshiped and adored her: Cindy and Del Van Dorn, Todd and Jeri Schaeffer, Christy and Tyler Schaefferwhose love and affection sustained her. Sadye's remarkably strong spirit and will to live, just so she could be with all her children, will be remembered deep in the hearts of her family. Sadye was an angel, a saint.
