        LEON--James L., 87. A resident of New York City for over 55 years, died on March 26, 2006. Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1918, he moved with his family to Athens, Greece at the age of two. He fulfilled his childhood dream of becoming a Civil Engineer, and moved back to the USA in 1947 to advance his career. While living in New York, he met Dr. Sophia Vourna, who was visiting from Athens, and they were happily married for 53 years. During his professional career, he worked with many distinguished architects, including Frank Lloyd Wright, Marcel Breuer and Pier Luigi Nervi. His projects ranged throughout the USA and from Egypt to Paris to Hong Kong, receiving numerous awards and earning the respect and esteem of his colleagues. James is survived by his loving wife Sophia, his daughter Elena and John Madonia and granddaughter Sophia, his daughter Rania and Brian Kelly and grandchildren Alexandra, James and Jenna, his sister Louisa Markis and many nieces, nephews and dear relatives and friends in the USA and Greece. Jim, we will all miss the dignity and grace with which you lived, and your openhearted embrace of all those fortunate to know you.
