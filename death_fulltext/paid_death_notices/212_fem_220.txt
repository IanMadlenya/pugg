The Trustees, Faculty and Staff, Students, Parents and Alumnae of Convent of the Sacred Heart, New York City, deeply mourn the passing of an exceptional leader, gifted teacher and treasured friend.

She left an indelible mark on thousands of Sacred Heart students in New York and in many other Network schools with her profound spirituality, her emphasis on academic rigor and her openness to new approaches in education. Memorial gifts may be made to the Society of the Sacred Heart Retirement Fund, 4389 West Pine Boulevard, St. Louis, MO. 63108. Mary Blake, Ed.D, Head Mistress Laurette M. Bryan, Chair, Board of Trustees Convent of the Sacred Heart New York City
