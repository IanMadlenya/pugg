        NELSON--Trevor. 34, died suddenly of complications from viral meningitis on July 24. A summa cum laude graduate of U.C. Berkeley, Trevor was a producer at ''60 Minutes,'' champion skier, runner and overall sports enthusiast. He seized every waking moment of his life with an exuberance that was lovely to behold. He is survived by his adoring and devoted wife, Maggie; young sons, Conrad and George; mother, Suzanne Colt; sisters, Andrea Abbott and Angela Colt; stepfather, Edward Colt. A memorial service will be held at 11 AM, August 4, at the Church of the Heavenly Rest, 90th Street and 5th Avenue. In lieu of flowers donations in Trevor Nelson's name may be made to St. Bernard's School in New York City, The Central Park Conservancy, and The Trustees of the Reservation, Beverly, MA. >>AD#
