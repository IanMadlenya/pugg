        LEWIS-Joseph S. Our entire family deeply mourns the passing of Joseph, who lost his 10 year battle with leukemia on August 20, 2002. Truly a gentleman, his elegance and grace touched many people. We will remember him especially for his generosity, love of life, music and writing, but most of all, his dedication to his family and fellows. Brigitte Lewis-Diederich Joseph S.
