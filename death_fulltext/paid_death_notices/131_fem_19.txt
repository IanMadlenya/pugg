        SCHREIER-Barbara. The staff, officers and members of the American Technion Society (ATS) sorrowfully mourn the untimely passing of Barbara Schreier, wife of Stephen Schreier, our Senior Vice President for Campaign. A woman of indomitable spirit, she battled her illness courageously for many years while maintaining her career as professor and chair of the Social Work Department at Central Connecticut State University, authoring professional papers and presenting at national forums. An exceptionally kind and caring person, she engendered respect and devotion among numerous and diverse people. including many in our ATS family whom she often joined for programs in this country and at the Technion. Her warmth, wit and liveliness will be sorely missed by so many of us who were proud to call her a friend. We extend our condolences to her husband Stephen, her daughter Deborah Leipzig, her stepsons Benji and Daniel, and all members of the Schreier family.
