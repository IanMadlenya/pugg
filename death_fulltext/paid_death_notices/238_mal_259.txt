        RODRIGUEZ--Anthony J. (Tucho, Tony). Retired executive, passed away on Thursday, November 16, 2006 at Calvary Hospital after a valiant battle against pancreatic cancer. Over his 35 years in the clock industry, Tony--or as his family and closest friends called him, Tucho--served as Vice President of Bulova's Clock Division for 28 years . He later became President of Linden Clocks and Vice President of the Sharp Corporation. Tucho loved to play golf, poker, and the ponies; however, his greatest love was his boyhood sweetheart and wife of 43 years, Joyce, and his greatest pride was his two sons, Anthony J. Rodriguez, Jr., Esq. and Dr. Charles L. Rodriguez. He is also survived by his daughters-in-law, Joanie and Jane, and five grandchildren, Isabel, Julia, Alex, Andrew and Christian. He will sorely be missed by his sister, Dr. Dolores M. Fernandez,whose greatest sense of pride was to be called, ''Tucho's sister''; his brother-inlaw, Nick; and in-laws Nancy, Tony, Henry and Betty. He was a loving uncle to David, Steven, Anne-Nicole, Anthony and Linda. Many cousins and friends will miss his many stories and anecdotes that kept everyone entertained. Everyone who knew him wanted to be called his friend. He had a warm and outgoing personality that was the impetus for his business and personal success. Interment was at St. Charles Cemetery, Long Island. Contributions may be made in his name and memory to NYU Medical Center, Office of Development, 550 First Avenue, PRK9, NYC, c/o Dr. Martin Kahn, Cardiovascular Care.
