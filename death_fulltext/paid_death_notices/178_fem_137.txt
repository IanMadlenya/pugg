        WEXNER-Bella. The officers, Board of Trustees and staff of the Leo Yassenoff Jewish Community Center of Greater Columbus mourn the passing of Bella Wexner, mother of Leslie Wexner and Susan Wexner, a true philanthropist, a leader whose lifelong devotion to the Jewish Community throughout the United States and Israel was deeply felt. She was a generous supporter of the Jewish Community in Columbus, in particular, the Wexner Heritage Village. Her dedication to Israel included many philanthropic projects. Our heartfelt condolences are extended to Leslie, Abigail and to the entire Wexner family. She will be sorely missed. Jeff Coopersmith, President Joel Dinkin, Executive Director
