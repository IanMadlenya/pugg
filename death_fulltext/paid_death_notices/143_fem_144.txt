        MORGENTHAU-Emmy Lou. We will sorely miss our dearest Emmy Lou. What mountains she moved with her gifts of joy and wisdom and hope. What love she offered us, freely and unequivocally. What compassion she showed for our children. The Board of Directors, staff and children of Interfaith Neighbors extend to her family our deepest sympathies and affection.
        MORGENTHAU - Emmy Lou. With ''a glow no tide can ever break'' you nurtured hundreds of campers. Your cabin and your heart were always open. Aunt Emmy, your precious memory is ''ours to have and hold''. Members of the Winnebago Alumni Association
