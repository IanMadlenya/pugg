        McINERNEY - Denis. The partners, associates and staff of the firm of Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP are profoundly saddened by the passing of Denis McInerney, our distinguished former partner and friend of over 40 years. The former President of the New York County Lawyers Association, and a Fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers, he was a skilled advocate at every level including the U.S. Supreme Court. He served his country, his profession, his community and his faith. Our heartfelt sympathy to his wife, Irene, and his three children, Kathleen O'Hare, Denis J. and Maura Romano.
