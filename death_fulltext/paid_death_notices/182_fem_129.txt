        HUPER-Leonor Arguello. In Managua, 9 March. Nicaraguan patriot and former ambassador. Beloved mother, sister, grandmother, aunt and friend, mentor to many. Fierce believer in her country's right to be rid of dictatorship, she was a proud Sandinista. I was privileged to have had her as mi adorada tia roja. Michael Lane Arguello
