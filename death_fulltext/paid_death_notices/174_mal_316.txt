        MOSS-Frederick, 72. Died on July 27 after a long battle with cancer; his family was at his side. He is survived by his beloved family: wife, Jan; children, Rebecca Guyver, Benjamin Moss, Katherine Kehoe, Joseph Wayland; brother Gerald Moss; and nine grandchildren. A loving husband, father and grandfather, ''King'' will be missed and remembered always for his fine mind, his acerbic wit, his integrity and his inability to bore. Mr. Moss was a graduate of Columbia Law School and had a long and distinguished career as a senior executive in the Securities Industry and was, at his death, Chairman of the Board of the Cincinnati Stock Exchange. A memorial service will be held, at a later date, on Great Cranberry Island, Maine. If you wish to honor his memory, please do a kindness for someone in need.
