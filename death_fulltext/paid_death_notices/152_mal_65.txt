        VASSILIEV-Igor Vladimirovitch. The Members, Directors and Officers of the Russian Nobility Association in America deeply regret the untimely death of their esteemed Director and Corporate Secretary while on vacation in Europe. Born in Riga, Latvia, he was a highly regarded construction engineer, having taken degrees at both Berlin University and Columbia University in New York. As an avocation, he was a world-renowned philatelist. Ever dedicated to the service of those less fortunate, he was active in many charitable organizations in NYC and environs. Funeral services will be held at the Church of Our Lady of Kazan, Bryant Avenue, Sea Cliff, New York at 10AM on Tuesday, September 7, 1999 with interment to follow. His quiet devotion toward the many charitable pursuits of the Russian Nobility Association and his tireless concern for the well-being of the sick and elderly was legendary.
