        Generosa Ammon Pelosi, the widow of R. Theodore Ammon, a millionaire Manhattan financier who was killed at his home on Long Island in 2001, died on Friday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 46.
        The cause was breast cancer, said Paul B. Bergman, the lawyer for Daniel Pelosi, her husband.
        Mr. Ammon, who was chairman of Jazz at Lincoln Center, was found bludgeoned to death on Oct. 22, 2001, at his estate in East Hampton, N.Y. His widow and Mr. Pelosi married three months later.
        Mr. and Mrs. Pelosi have denied any involvement in the killing, and the authorities have not publicly named any suspects.
        The Ammons were in the final stages of a divorce at the time of Mr. Ammon's death but were still married. His widow was co-executor of the estate with J. P. Morgan Chase & Company.
        Mr. Pelosi, an electrician, said in an interview with The New York Post in January 2002 that he and Mrs. Pelosi, who was then Mrs. Ammon, had been planning their marriage for more than a year before the killing.
        Mrs. Pelosi was born in Laguna Beach, Calif., Gotham magazine said in May 2002. She discovered from a photo inscription that her father was an Italian sailor. Her mother died when she was 10 and her only sibling, a sister, when she was 17.
        Mrs. Pelosi graduated from the University of California at Irvine in 1981. She moved to New York to be an artist, working in found industrial objects, but lost interest, New York magazine said this July.
        She began working as an apartment rental agent and Mr. Ammon was one of her clients. They married in the mid-1980's.
        In addition to her husband, Mrs. Pelosi, who lived in East Hampton, is survived by her two children, Alexa and Grego.
