        Sara Ann Freed, an award-winning editor of crime fiction, died on Wednesday. She was 57 and lived in New York City.
        She had been under treatment for leukemia, Warner Books said in a statement announcing her death.
        She was editor in chief of Mysterious Press and senior editor at Warner Books, which are both imprints of the AOL Time Warner Book Group. Among the writers she edited are Marcia Muller, Margaret Maron, James Patterson, Kate White, Ed Dee, David Rosenfelt, James Siegel, Robert Greer, Kelly Lange and Michael Walsh. In 1999 the Mystery Writers of America gave her an Ellery Queen Award, which honors distinguished people in the mystery-publishing business.
        In 1988 Patricia Cornwell, now a well-known crime writer, was advised privately by Ms. Freed to make Dr. Kay Scarpetta, a fictional medical examiner, the chief character in the book that Ms. Cornwell was writing. The book, ''Postmortem,'' had been rejected by several publishing houses, but it was a success with the public when it came out in 1990. And Kay Scarpetta loomed large in subsequent Cornwell crime novels.
        A native of Souderton, Pa., Ms. Freed got her start in publishing by working for a small religious publishing house. Later she moved to New York City, where she worked for various publishers before she joined Mysterious Press as a manuscript reader in 1985.
        She is survived by her husband, Ira Weissman; a stepson, Michael; four brothers; and a sister.
