        Susan Johnson, who sang in musical theater on and off Broadway in the 1950's, died on Feb. 24 at her daughter's home in Sacramento. She was 75.
        She had emphysema, said Greg MacKellan, who produced some CD's she sang on.
        Her biggest moment came when she was a featured performer in the role of Cleo, the heroine's waitress friend, in the musical ''The Most Happy Fella.'' It opened on Broadway in 1956.
        She won a Theater World Award for her performance.
        She was born in Columbus, Ohio, and arrived in New York City in 1947. She was in the chorus of Radio City Music Hall. By 1950 she had the comic role of Meg Brockie in the musical ''Brigadoon'' at the New York City Center near Broadway.
        Her marriage to Robert Pastene, an actor, ended in divorce. Her second husband, Chet Kehn, died in 1984.
        Her survivors include a daughter, Corianne, from her second marriage.
