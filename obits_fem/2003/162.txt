        Cleo Athenos Stark, who performed with the modern-dance companies of Doris Humphrey and Charles Weidman in the 1920's and 30's, died on Nov. 9 in Manhattan, where she lived. She was 95.
        Born in Greece, Ms. Stark came to the United States as a child. She trained at the Denishawn School, a pioneering dance academy founded by Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn. Early in her career she performed briefly with a group that accompanied Sally Rand, the burlesque fan dancer and stripper. In one number, in which Rand portrayed a bird, Ms. Stark danced as part of one wing.
        She performed with Humphrey and Weidman from 1928 to 1934 and was in the original casts of many of their dances. Ms. Stark, who used her maiden name, Athenos, professionally, also staged dances in 1933 for a revue called ''Hunky-Dory,'' and danced in solo recitals after leaving Humphrey and Weidman. She was an artistic adviser to the Doris Humphrey Festival, produced by Mino Nicholas in 1990 at the Pace Downtown Theater in Manhattan.
        Ms. Stark is survived by her son, Carl.
        Correction:  December 2, 2003, Tuesday  An obituary on Friday about Cleo Stark, a modern dancer of the 1920's and 30's, misspelled her maiden name, under which she performed. It was Atheneos, not Athenos.
