        Yousra Abdel Raouf al-Kidwa, the sister of Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, died at the Palestine Hospital in Cairo today after a month of treatment for various disorders associated with old age, said the Palestinian ambassador to the Arab League, Muhammad Sobeih. She was 77.
        Mrs. Kidwa is survived by three daughters; a son, Nassir al-Kidwa, the Palestinian representative at the United Nations; and her husband, Jarir al-Kidwa, an adviser to Mr. Arafat.
        Ambassador Sobeih said Mrs. Kidwa would be buried in Khan Yunis, in the Gaza Strip, but it was not clear whether Mr. Arafat, whose headquarters is surrounded by Israeli forces in the West Bank city of Ramallah, would attend the funeral.
