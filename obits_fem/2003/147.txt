        Thalia Mara, a ballet educator who helped found the USA International Ballet Competition in Jackson, Miss., died on Wednesday at St. Dominic/Jackson Memorial Hospital. She was 92 and lived in Jackson.
        Born in Chicago to Russian parents, Ms. Mara trained with some of the great ballet figures of the 20th century, among them Adolph Bolm, Olga Preobajenska, Nicholas Legat and Michel Fokine. She made her professional debut in 1926 with the Ravinia Park Opera Ballets in Chicago, leaving after a year to join the Carina Ari Ballet in Paris.
        Ms. Mara directed the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in 1947 and also danced there with her husband, Arthur Mahoney, from whom she separated in 1964.
        The two founded the National Academy of Ballet and Theater Arts in New York in 1962. The school closed in 1973.
        Ms. Mara wrote 11 books on ballet, many of which were dance students' easy-to-read instructional works, including ''The Language of Ballet,'' ''So You Want to Be a Ballet Dancer'' and the ''Steps in Ballet'' series. Many were translated and published in other countries.
        Ms. Mara moved to Jackson, Miss., in the mid-1970's, at an invitation of the Jackson Ballet Guild to create a professional ballet troupe. She worked with the company for six years, resigning in 1981. A judge at the International Ballet Competition in Varna, Bulgaria, Ms. Mara worked with Robert Joffrey, the artistic director of the Joffrey Ballet, and the dance writer Walter Terry to create a competition on that circuit in Jackson. She served as the artistic director for the triennial USA International Ballet Competition from 1986 to 1994.
        Ms. Mara founded the nonprofit Thalia Mara Arts International Foundation, which sponsored teacher training scholarships, a piano competition and performances in Jackson by dance companies and musicians. In 1994 the city's Municipal Auditorium was renamed Thalia Mara Hall.
