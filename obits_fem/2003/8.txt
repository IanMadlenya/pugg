        Rae Carlson, a psychologist who helped shape the study of personality with her 1971 paper ''Where Is the Person in Personality Research?'', died on Monday in Fairfax, Va. She was 76.
        The cause was pneumonia, said her daughter Leslie Carlson-Soloway.
        Dr. Carlson's paper was published at a time when personality researchers were primarily engaged in the study of mood, thinking and perception, conducting experiments that did not take the psychology of the individual test subjects into account.
        Dr. Carlson called for a renewed emphasis on the study of individual lives, examined from a variety of angles.
        She established the Society for Personology in 1982 to advance this research orientation. She also studied issues like altruism and political ideology, and wrote psychobiographical works on historical figures including Nathaniel Hawthorne and Karl Marx's daughter Eleanor.
        In 1989, she received the Henry A. Murray Award, for the study of individual lives, from the American Psychological Association.
        Dr. Carlson was a professor of psychology at Rutgers University, retiring in 1996. She received her Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Michigan in 1958.
        Rae Stahl Carlson was born in Valentine, Neb. She lived for 25 years in Princeton, N.J., and was a resident of Fairfax at the time of her death. In addition to her daughter Leslie, of Santa Fe, N.M., Dr. Carlson is survived by her daughter Tracy Carlson of Oakton, Va., and four grandchildren.
