        Lois Fried Rosenfield, a theatrical and film producer with her husband, Maurice, died on May 25 at her home in Glencoe, Ill. She was 78.
        The cause was cancer, her family said.
        Mrs. Rosenfield and her husband backed Broadway productions like ''Barnum'' (1980), a 1983 revival of ''The Glass Menagerie'' and ''Singin' in the Rain'' (1985), which they also presented in London.
        Their company, Rosenfield Productions, got its start in 1973 with the film ''Bang the Drum Slowly,'' a classic baseball tale. Mrs. Rosenfield took credit for casting a virtually unknown Robert De Niro as the doomed catcher, and Mr. Rosenfield, a Chicago corporate lawyer, appeared as a team owner.
        Off Broadway, in 1988, the couple helped produce a new play by Athol Fugard, ''The Road to Mecca.'' They also produced ''Falsettoland'' Off Broadway and ''Other People's Money'' in Chicago.
        Lois Rosenfield grew up in Chicago, the daughter of a clothing manufacturer. She attended public schools and the University of Wisconsin. Besides her husband, she is survived by her sons, James, of Santa Fe, N.M., and Andrew, of Lake Forest, Ill.; her brothers, Howard and Donald Fried; and four grandchildren.
