        Lillian Nadel Gerard, who was active in exhibiting and marketing foreign films in the United States for three decades, died last Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 88.
        The cause was complications of cancer, her husband, Philip R. Gerard, said.
        After she was hired in 1936 by an American importer of foreign films, she did publicity and advertising for ''The Eternal Mask,'' a film produced in Switzerland.
        As she recalled in 1985, ''That picture launched my debut in foreign films, and through my hands passed films of every origin in every genre, films that are now classics: 'Grand Illusion,' 'Pépé le Moko,' 'Children of Paradise,' 'The Seventh Seal' and many others, including a revival of Chaplin's 'City Lights.' ''
        Over the years, she was an executive of the Paris Theater in Manhattan and a consultant to the Rugoff Theaters, the Little Carnegie and the Fifth Avenue Cinema. She also worked with independent film importers.
        In 1950, as the Paris Theater's managing director, she protested the banning by New York City's Department of Licenses of the film ''The Miracle'' as ''blasphemous'' while it was being shown at the Paris.
        She also worked on special projects at the Museum of Modern Art.
        A Bronx native, she grew up in Manhattan and graduated from Bernard Baruch College.
        Besides her husband, she is survived by a son, Richard; a daughter, Jennifer Gerard Maric; three grandchildren; and a brother, Irwin.
