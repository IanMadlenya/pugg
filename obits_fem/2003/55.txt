        Caroline H. Newhouse, a philanthropist and artist who was the widow of Theodore Newhouse, a co-founder of the Newhouse communications company, died on Saturday at her weekend home in Roxbury, Conn. She was 94 and lived in Manhattan.
        Her husband, whom she wed in 1956, and his brothers Samuel I. and Norman created one of the country's largest communications conglomerates, whose parent company is now called Advance Publications Inc. Theodore died in 1998. Mrs. Newhouse was an aunt of S.I. Newhouse Jr., chairman of Cond√© Nast Publications, owned by Advance Publications.
        With her husband and on her own, she supported numerous cultural organizations in New York City with fund-raising and direct help. They included Career Transition for Dancers, an organization that she and her husband started, which helps dancers move on to new careers after they stop dancing.
        She was one of the New York City Opera's original board members. After she retired from that post, she encouraged her nephew Mark Newhouse to join the board. He later became its president.
        Born in a village near the city of Koblenz in western Germany, she originally had the surname Herz. She began studying the arts in Germany and became a sculptor and painter. She came to the United States in 1934 and attended the Art Students League in Manhattan.
        She is survived by two grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
        Correction:  May 1, 2003, Thursday  An obituary on Tuesday about Caroline Newhouse, a philanthropist and widow of a founder of the Newhouse communications company, misstated her age. She was 93, not 94.
