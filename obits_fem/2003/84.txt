        Marilyn Cole Fischbach, the founder and former sole owner of the Fischbach Gallery in Manhattan, known for showing work by young artists, died on Sunday in Paris. She was 72 and had lived mainly in Paris for two decades.
        She had a long illness, said her sister, Sheila Cole.
        Mrs. Fischbach founded the gallery in 1960 at 799 Madison Avenue, at 67th Street. She was its sole owner from then until the early 1980's, when she became one of four partners. She remained a partner until her death.
        She had a flair for discovering and representing young artists who later became well known, including Ronald Bladen, Eva Hesse and Alex Katz.
        When Mrs. Fischbach founded the gallery, she showed 1960's avant-garde art, which had not yet found an audience. When she moved the gallery to two successive locations on 57th Street, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, she began showing art that was less avant-garde and more realistic, including works by Jane Freilicher and Nell Blaine.
        Last year the gallery moved to 210 West 11th Street, at 25th Street, in Manhattan.
        Marilyn Cole was born in Manhattan, where she attended the Ethical Culture School. She graduated from the Fieldston School in the Bronx, and attended New York University.
        In addition to her sister, Sheila Cole of Sonoma, Calif., Mrs. Fischbach's survivors include her husband, Herbert X. Fischbach of Sonoma; sons Peter, of St. Petersburg, Fla., John, of New Orleans, and James, of Phoenix; a daughter, Sally Fischbach-Willard of Geneva, Switzerland; and grandchildren.
        Correction:  June 21, 2003, Saturday  An obituary yesterday about Marilyn Cole Fischbach, founder of the Fischbach Gallery in Manhattan, misstated its address. It is at 210 11th Avenue, not 210 West 11th Street.
