        Eve Stillman, a retired lingerie designer who also owned and led the lingerie company that bore her name, died on Friday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 97.
        In the 1940's when Gracette Lingerie, a company founded by her husband, Harry Stillman, encountered financial problems, she intervened and helped shift the company to higher-priced products.
        In 1956 she changed the company's name to Eve Stillman, and later it became Eve Stillman Inc.
        Its products included hand-embroidered nightgowns, and it had particular success with horsehair petticoats for the full-skirted fashions of the 1950's.
        In 1981, she received a Femmy award from Intimate Apparel Industry, a trade group for lingerie makers.
        When she retired in 1989 most of the assets of her company were sold and became a division of Kefco Industries.
        Eve Feinberg was born in Upper Manhattan and attended Hunter College.
        Her husband died in 1979 after 44 years of marriage.
        She is survived by her twin sister, Bertha Freeman of Miami; a brother, David Feinberg of West Palm Beach, Fla.; a daughter, Frances Linderman of Trinidad, Calif.; and two grandchildren.
