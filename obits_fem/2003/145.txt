        Wendy Marx, who became the spokeswoman of a foundation named for her after being saved by a liver transplant, died on Tuesday in Palo Alto, Calif. She was 36 and lived in San Francisco.
        The cause was hepatitis B, which once again flared in Ms. Marx's system and attacked her liver, her brother Jeffrey said. She received her first transplant in 1990 and a second in 1992, after another flare-up of hepatitis. She had been No. 1 on the waiting list for a new liver of her blood type for a month before her death, Mr. Marx said.
        In 1990, the Wendy Marx Foundation for Organ Donor Awareness was established by the Marx siblings and the Olympic sprinter Carl Lewis, with whom Mr. Marx was cooperating on a book.
        Among other educational activities, the foundation published a book by Mr. Marx, a 1986 Pulitzer Prize-winner, called ''It Gets Dark Sometimes: My Sister's Fight to Live and Save Lives'' (Jam Publishing, 2000).
        Wendy Elizabeth Marx was born in Manhattan on June 7, 1967, and grew up in Rye Brook, N.Y. She graduated cum laude from Duke University in 1989 and headed for San Francisco to start a career in marketing.
        Soon after arriving, she contracted hepatitis B, which quickly worsened. At one point she was in a coma and was given 24 hours to live.
        Mr. Marx and Mr. Lewis decided to start the foundation regardless of what happened to Ms. Marx. After she received a last-minute organ donation and recovered, she joined the initiative. In 2000, Ms. Marx married E. David Ellington.
        In addition to Mr. Ellington, of San Francisco, and Jeffrey Marx, who lives in Washington, D.C., she is survived by her mother, Peggy Marx of Lake Worth, Fla.; her father, Richard, of Bedford, N.Y., and another brother, James, of White Plains, N.Y.
