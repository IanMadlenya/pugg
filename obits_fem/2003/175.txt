        Elizabeth Stevenson, the first executive director of the National Brain Tumor Foundation, died on Nov. 30 in San Francisco, where she made her home. She was 57.
        The cause was complications of pneumonia and of a brain tumor first diagnosed in 1979, her family said.
        The foundation was formed in 1981 as a support group bringing together brain tumor patients, doctors and medical researchers. Ms. Stevenson organized the office of executive director in 1985 as the group expanded its fund-raising efforts for patient care and the search for a cure.
        She stepped down in 1989 but remained a consultant and was on the board at her death.
        Elizabeth Fullerton Stevenson was born in Bryn Mawr, Pa.; graduated from Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn.; and in 1968 received a bachelor's degree in history from Stanford. She worked at KQED, the public television station in Los Angeles, before heading to New York, where she became an assistant in the office of Mayor John V. Lindsay before returning to California in 1973.
        There she worked for Representative Paul N. McCloskey as office manager and for Santa Clara County as director of governmental relations. From 1978 to 1982, she was director of public affairs for the Cowles Media Company in Minneapolis.
        Ms. Stevenson was also a former member of the board of the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship.
        She is survived by her husband, Francisco Cancino; two sisters, Sally S. Fischer, who lives in France, and Patience S. Scott of Riverhead, N.Y.; a brother, John R. Stevenson Jr. of Woodacre, Calif.; and her stepmother, Ruth Carter Stevenson of Fort Worth.
        Correction:  January 1, 2004, Thursday  An obituary on Dec. 19 about Elizabeth Stevenson, the first executive director of the Brain Tumor Foundation, misstated the location of the public television station KQED, for which she once worked. It is in San Francisco, not Los Angeles.
