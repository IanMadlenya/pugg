        Sylvia Regan Ellstein, who wrote a two-act comedy, ''The Fifth Season,'' a Broadway hit in 1953, died Jan. 18 in Manhattan. She was 94.
        The play, by Sylvia Regan, as she was widely known, was a comedy about the dress trade. Brooks Atkinson, reviewing it in The New York Times, called it ''an entertaining piece of merchandise.''
        Sylvia Hoffenberg was born in New York and attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.
        As Sylvia Hoffman she began on the Broadway stage in 1926 as Anna, a Rumanian girl, in ''The Americans,'' a comedy about assimilating American ways. In the 1930's she was married to and divorced from James J. Regan, a lawyer, and did public relations work in theater.
        ''Morning Star,'' a drama she wrote about immigrant family life on Manhattan's Lower East Side, opened on Broadway in 1940. It closed after 55 performances but has lived on in a Yiddish musical version and other productions.
        In 1940 she married Abraham Ellstein. They contributed to a musical comedy, ''Great to be Alive!,'' which had its Broadway premiere in 1950.
        Mr. Ellstein died in 1963. Her survivors include three brothers.
