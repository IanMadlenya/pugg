        LaVern Baker, one of the most important rhythm-and-blues singers of the 1950's, died on Monday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 67.
        The cause was heart complications, The Associated Press said.
        Ms. Baker was a mainstay of the Atlantic Records roster of the mid-1950's, applying the fervor of gospel and the bluesy power of Bessie Smith to songs about love and lust like ''Tweedlee Dee.'' Her string of hits ended by the mid-1960's, but in the late 1980's she made a comeback, appearing on Broadway in ''Black and Blue'' and recording new albums.
        Ms. Baker, whose original name was Delores Williams, was born in Chicago; an aunt was the blues singer Memphis Minnie. Ms. Baker sang gospel in church, and in the mid-1940's she worked as a blues singer, calling herself Little Miss Sharecropper and Bea Baker.
        She could growl the blues or sing with sweet playfulness, and the big-band leader Fletcher Henderson convinced OKeh Records to sign her. She recorded jazz-tinged songs for OKeh and then rhythm-and-blues for King Records without much impact. But in 1953, she was signed to Atlantic Records.
        Her second session for the label yielded ''Tweedlee Dee,'' which its producer, Jerry Wexler, called ''a soulful nursery jingle''; it had originally been intended as the B-side of a single. It reached No. 14 on the pop chart in 1954 and eventually sold a million copies. But in that segregated era, a version recorded with the same musicians by a white singer, Georgia Gibbs, reached No. 2. Ms. Baker estimated that she had lost $15,000 in royalties and wrote her Congressman to protest, receiving only campaign material in return.
        But through the 1950's, she was a consistent hit maker. She performed in ''Rock, Rock, Rock!,'' a 1956 movie with the disk jockey Alan Freed. ''Jim Dandy,'' released in 1957, sold a million copies; other rhythm-and-blues hits included ''Bop Ting-a-Ling,'' ''Play It Fair,'' ''Jim Dandy Got Married'' and ''Voodoo Voodoo.'' She recorded an album of Bessie Smith songs in 1958. In 1959, the ballad ''I Cried a Tear'' reached No.  6 on the pop chart, and in the early 1960's Ms. Baker had minor hits including ''Shake a Hand,'' ''See See Rider'' and ''Saved.''
        She switched to Brunswick Records in 1963, where she recorded standards like ''Fly Me to the Moon.'' In 1969, she developed pneumonia while entertaining troops in Vietnam, and went to the Philippines for treatment. She stayed there for nearly two decades, running a nightclub in Subic Bay. But in 1988, she performed at Madison Square Garden at a 40th-anniversary concert for Atlantic Records, and was rediscovered. She replaced Ruth Brown in the Broadway revue ''Black and Blue.'' In 1990, she received a career achievement award from the Rhythm-and-Blues Foundation and in 1991 she was inducted into the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame. Her Atlantic hits were reissued, and she made new albums for the DRG label in 1991 and 1992.
        Ms. Baker had a stroke in the early 1990's, and complications from diabetes forced her to have her legs amputated in 1995. But she returned to performing in 1996 with an undiminished voice and an indomitable spirit.

        A picture credit on Wednesday with an obituary of the rhythm-and-blues singer LaVern Baker misspelled the surname of the photographer and misstated the date. The photographer was Jack Vartoogian, not Vatoogian. The picture was taken in 1996, not 1966.
