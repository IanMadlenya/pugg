        Amanda Pirie Warrington, an equestrian, died yesterday at Christiana Hospital in Newark, Del., of injuries she received after falling from her horse while competing at the Fair Hill horse trials in Maryland. She was 29 and lived in Unionville, Pa.
        Mrs. Warrington was considered  one of the top riders in the country in the three-day event. In that Olympic equestrian discipline, the horse and rider are called on to perform a prescribed set of movements called  dressage; a speed and endurance test, which involves jumping a set of fixed obstacles in the countryside, and show jumping.
        She represented the United States in 1996 at the Blenheim Castle three-day event in England; also that year she won the fall national championship three-day event of the United States equestrian team at Fair Hill. Earlier this year she won the Essex three-day event in Gladstone, N.J.
        She was born on Aug. 22, 1968, in Boston, the daughter of Robert S. Pirie, vice chairman of investment banking at Societe Generale Securities Corporation, and Deirdre H. Pirie, also an equestrian. She was  educated at Marlboro College in Marlboro, Vt., and was married in June 1993 to Daniel L. Warrington, a race horse trainer.
        In addition to her parents, of Hamilton, Mass., and her husband, she is survived by a sister, Sophie Clifton of Bozeman, Mont., and a brother, John Pirie of Hamilton.
