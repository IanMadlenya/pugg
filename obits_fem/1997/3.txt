        Edna Morris, prominent in thoroughbred racing and social circles for more than 50 years and a major fund-raiser for the Girl Scouts of Greater New York, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 88.
        A son, Alfred (Chappy) Morris, said she had been in failing health for several years.
        Mrs. Morris was a familiar figure at race tracks, often accompanied by her friend, Jean MacArthur, the widow of Gen. Douglas MacArthur. The all-scarlet racing colors carried by Morris horses, the oldest continuous silks in the country, were originated by the family before the Civil War. The first running of the Belmont Stakes in 1867 was won by the filly Ruthless, who raced for Francis Morris, the great-grandfather of Mrs. Morris's husband, John A. Morris.
        Mr. Morris, a Wall Street stockbroker and a former president of the Thoroughbred Racing Association, died in 1985 at 93.
        Mrs. Morris was active in several organizations, particularly in fund raising, but her principal activity was with the Girl Scouts, for whom she organized and presided over a number of benefits.
        ''I'm trying to do my little bit for women,'' she said at a benefit in 1968. ''Scouting is an informal lesson in growing up, in learning resourcefulness, how to evaluate and how to cope -- and men today want women who can cope.''
        She was born in Manhattan on Nov. 13, 1908, the daughter of Howard and Edna (Dolma) Brokaw. Her father, an accomplished polo player, was co-owner of Brokaw Brothers Clothing, a retail store on Fifth Avenue near the New York Public Library. She was a graduate of Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn.
        In addition to her son Alfred, of Manhattan, she is survived by another son, Dr. John Morris Jr. of Nashville.
