        Claire Giannini Hoffman, the first woman to serve on the boards of  Bank of America and Sears, Roebuck & Company, died Monday of respiratory failure at her home in San Mateo, Calif., the bank said. She was 92.
        In 1949 Mrs. Hoffman became a director of the Bank of America, succeeding her father, A.P. Giannini, the bank's founder, who died that year. She served until 1986. Mrs. Hoffman joined the Sears board in 1963 and served until 1970.
        Her husband, Clifford Pierson Hoffman, died in 1954. She had no children. Her estate will pass to her private foundation, the bank said.
