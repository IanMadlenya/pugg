        Denise Browne Hare, who photographed many leading painters and sculptors of the mid-20th century, died on Wednesday at Sharon Hospital in Sharon, Conn. She was 73 and lived in Amenia, N.Y.
        The cause was cancer, said her son Morgan Hare.
        Ms. Hare was born in Manhattan. During World War II, she worked as an analyst for Army Intelligence in Washington.
        Ms. Hare and her first husband, Edmund Delaney, moved to New York City in the 1940's, where she became friends with artists including Mark Rothko. After her divorce from Mr. Delaney, she married the sculptor David Hare in 1962, and the Hare household became a favorite haunt of still other artists.
        Her photographs of Joseph Cornell and Philip Guston appeared in books by Dore Ashton in 1974 and 1976.
        Ms. Hare's marriage ended in divorce in 1986.
        In addition to her son Morgan of Manhattan, she is survived by a son, Nick Delaney of Seattle; a daughter, Topher Delaney of San Francisco; two sisters, Eliane Koevas of Chester, Conn., and Jenny de Kergolay of Paris, and six grandchildren.
