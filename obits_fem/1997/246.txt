        Sally Marr, the mother of the comedian Lenny Bruce and a primary influence on her son's career, died Sunday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 91 and lived in West Hollywood.
        Although Ms. Marr was mainly known for encouraging her son as a performer, she was herself a professional comic and talent spotter. Among those she helped discover were Pat Morita, Cheech Marin, Tommy Chong and Sam Kinison.
        She was born Sadie Kitchenberg in Jamaica, N.Y., and was married at 17. After her husband left her, she brought up their son, Leonard, on her own, supporting the two of them by working as a waitress and maid. Subsequently she made her night club debut as a stand-up comic, doing impersonations of movie stars like James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart. Her son started his career by imitating his mother's act, then, urged on by her, he began creating his own routines, drawing freely from his life with his mother.
        After Bruce died in 1966, Ms. Marr continued to perform, appearing in night clubs, in movies and on television. In 1994, Joan Rivers was one of the authors and the star of ''Sally Marr . . . and Her Escorts,'' a Broadway play ''suggested by the life of Sally Marr.''
        In a 1989 interview, Ms. Marr said: ''People are always saying that everything in comedy stems from Lenny -- that everything touches him. What can I tell you? He took after me!''
        She is survived by a granddaughter, Kitty Bruce of Pittston, Pa.
