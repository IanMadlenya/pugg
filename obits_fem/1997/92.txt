        Irma Bezold Wilkinson, a benefactor and former staff member of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, died on April 24 at the Noble Horizons Nursing Home in Salisbury, Conn. She was 91 and had homes in Sharon, Conn., and Manhattan.
        Mrs. Wilkinson, an Islamicist and a collector, worked with her husband, Charles, to benefit both the Metropolitan and the Brooklyn Museum of Art. With him and on her own, she made significant contributions to the Islamic and Middle Eastern collections of both museums.
        Among her donations to the Metropolitan were ceramic vessels, bronze pins and a goblet, miniature weapons and a stone cup from the ancient Middle East and a lacquer mirror case and ceramics for the Islamic Department. She also donated an album of photographs of archeological digs in the region.
        She was born in Germantown, Wis., and graduated from the University of Wisconsin in 1929, the year she joined the staff of the Metropolitan. In 1949 she became the museum's registrar and superviser of the Catalogue of Collections, which lists everything in the museum's vast collections.
        In 1958 she helped Dorothy H. Dudley, registrar of the Museum of Modern Art, write ''Museum Registration Methods.'' Published by the American Association of Museums, it is circulated worldwide and after two revisions remains a staple in the field.
        She resigned from the Metropolitan in 1963 when her husband stepped down as its curator of ancient Middle Eastern art. From then until 1974 he was Hagop Kevorkian Curator of Middle Eastern Art and Archeology at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, where he formed the core of an Islamic collection.
        In recent years Mrs. Wilkinson was on the Metropolitan's visiting committees for Middle Eastern, Islamic and Egyptian art. She helped create a lecture series on those subjects that is named in honor of her husband, who died in 1986.
        No immediate family members survive.
