        Hanna M. Bercovitch, the founding editor of the Library of America, died on Monday at her son's home in Madison, Wis. She was 63.
        She died of lung cancer, her family said in a statement.
        Ms. Bercovitch joined the Library of America in 1980, shortly after the nonprofit publishing house was founded to produce authoritative hardcover editions of American writers. She was its first staff editor and later became editor in chief, a position she held until retiring this year.
        Ms. Bercovitch oversaw the publication of the first 90 volumes in the Library of America, including editions of Richard Wright's ''Native Son,'' Zora Neale Hurston's ''Dust Tracks on a Road'' and John Steinbeck's ''Grapes of Wrath.'' She also assisted Noel Polk in restoring the original texts of William Faulkner's ''As I Lay Dying,'' ''Sanctuary,'' ''Light in August'' and ''Pylon.''
        To decide which text to publish she studied manuscripts, page proofs, galleys and correspondence, and worked closely with scholars, including Leon Edel, Arnold Rampersad, and Henry Louis Gates.
        ''It is hard to find anyone who has been more central to institutionalizing the canon of American literature,'' Mr. Gates said Thursday.
        As an editor at the Library of America, Ms. Berkovitch often undid what earlier editors had done. For example, when Harper & Brothers published Richard Wright's 1940 novel ''Native Son,'' they made some changes to suit the Book-of-the-Month Club. They deleted the passages that showed that the novel's black protagonist, Bigger Thomas, was sexually attracted to the white woman he ended up smothering. Under Ms. Bercovitch's supervision, those passages were restored.
        She is survived by her son, Eytan Bercovitch of Baltimore and Madison, and her brother, Leonard Malmquist of Laguna Beach, Calif.
