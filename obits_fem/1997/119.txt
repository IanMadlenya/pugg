        Martha Duffy, a former senior editor in charge of coverage of the performing arts for Time magazine, died yesterday at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 61 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer, said her husband, James Duffy.
        Mrs. Duffy, one of the first women to become a senior editor at the magazine, held that post from 1974 to 1989. She joined Time in 1960 and was a researcher and then a reporter,  contributing editor and associate editor before her promotion in 1974.
        She was a senior writer specializing in culture and entertainment news from 1989 until her death. She was also Time's longtime dance critic and was known as a mentor for young writers.
        Mrs. Duffy was promoted to senior editor while Henry Grunwald was Time's chief editor. In his memoir, ''One Man's America'' (1997), he described Mrs. Duffy as ''one of Time's outstanding cultural editors.''
        Early in her career, working on a cover story about the reclusive author J. D. Salinger, she distinguished herself by managing to trail him to a New Hampshire post office. She asked if they could talk, but he fled.
        Among the writers to whom she was a mentor was Frank Rich, who was a film and television critic for Time from 1977 to 1980 and is now an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times. ''She could improve any piece of copy, but she ultimately taught you how to improve your own copy,'' he recalled yesterday. ''She had a brain like steel.''
        Mrs. Duffy was born Martha Murphy in Boston and graduated in 1957 from Radcliffe College. An early marriage, to David McDowell, ended in divorce.
        In addition to her husband, she is survived by a sister, Anne Murphy of Manhattan.
