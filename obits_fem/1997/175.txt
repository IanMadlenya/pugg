        Mary Weinberger, a lifelong advocate for the rights of people with muscular dystrophy, died on Sept. 8 at the Jersey Shore Medical Center in Neptune, N.J. She was 89 and had lived in Long Beach, N.Y.
        Mrs. Weinberger had been hospitalized since June, when a coronary infection was diagnosed, a niece, Susan Dick of West Long Branch, N.J., said. Mrs. Weinberger died of bone marrow failure, Ms. Dick said.
        Mrs. Weinberger became involved in the rights of the disabled after doctors told her that her adopted son, Richard, 2, had muscular dystrophy.
        Richard had to use a wheelchair by the age of 5 and died, at 17, in 1959.
        She rallied for the rights of people with physical and mental disabilities to live in their own homes instead of  institutions.
        Along with her husband, Arnold, she was a founding member of the Muscular Dystrophy Association, the national organization best known for fund-raising telethons with its chairman, Jerry Lewis, as host.
        She set up a foundation named after her son and was among the founders of Independent Living for the Handicapped, a Brooklyn-based advocacy group that helps the severely disabled to live in their own homes.
        Mrs. Weinberger, a native of Manhattan, lived in Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, for most of her life until 1975, when she moved to Long Beach.
        Her husband died in 1983. She is survived by her sister, Frances Fenig of Miami Beach, Fla.
