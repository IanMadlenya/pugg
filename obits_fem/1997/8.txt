        Lubov Rostova, a dancer with the Ballets Russes companies of the 1930's, died on Monday at her home in Oyster Bay, L.I. She was 80.
        As a member of Col. W. de Basil's Ballets Russes, Ms. Rostova achieved critical acclaim in 1932 when, at 16, she danced the mysterious Hand of Fate pas de deux with Valentin Froman in the premiere of ''Cotillon,'' one of George Balanchine's major early works.
        Ms. Rostova, whose original name was Lucienne Kylberg, joined the new Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1938, dancing with the company until 1943 except for a brief period in 1942. Later, she and another dancer, Eugenie Delarova, ran a flower shop in Manhattan for two years.
        She is survived by a son, the Marquis de Dampierre of Paris, and a grandson, Aymar de Dampierre.
