        Elizabeth Tweedy Streibert, associate director of an international exhibition program at the Museum of Modern Art for 19 years, died on Tuesday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 57 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer, a museum official said.
        Ms. Streibert played a major role in negotiating where the museum's shows would tour worldwide, scheduling them in places from Cologne to Mexico City.
        She worked at the Modern on and off, beginning in 1966, in positions ranging from curatorial assistant in the department of painting and sculpture to senior exhibition assistant to assistant in the international circulating exhibitions program.
        She was a freelance curator and consultant from 1974 to 1977.
        From 1972 to 1974, she was a curator for private collections, including those of David Rockefeller, Carter Burden and William A. M. Burden.
        She was a curator of Philip Johnson's art collection for a brief period in 1969.
        She is survived by her husband, Marshall, and a brother, Thomas Tweedy of Minnesota.
