        Virginia A. Dwyer, a former senior vice president for finance at the AT&T Corporation and one of the first women to gain a top position at a major American company, died on Monday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. Miss Dwyer, a resident of Manhattan, was 76.
        The cause of death was cancer, her brother, Jack, said.
        Miss Dwyer spent her entire 43-year career at AT&T, starting as a clerk and rising to vice president and treasurer in 1979. In that capacity, she directed the company's stock and bond financing, at the time second in size only to the Federal Government's money-raising operations. Miss Dwyer was also responsible for three of the largest corporate stock offerings -- each exceeding $1 billion. In 1984, she was named senior vice president for finance.
        After the breakup of the Bell System in 1984, Miss Dwyer was also responsible for planning the stock distribution for the seven regional telephone companies that resulted. When she retired in 1986, Miss Dwyer was the highest-ranking woman ever at the company.
        She was the first chairwoman of the board of trustees at the University of Rochester in New York.
        In 1943, Miss Dwyer graduated from the University of Rochester with a bachelor's degree in economics and worked in New York City as a statistical clerk for Western Electric, an AT&T manufacturing subsidiary. In 1953 Miss Dwyer received a master's degree in economics at New York University and became  chief economist at Western Electric in 1972. She moved to the parent company as assistant treasurer three years later.
        She is survived by a sister, Marie Buley of Seaford, N.Y.; her brother, of Naples, Fla.; 8 nieces and nephews, and 13 great-nieces and great-nephews.
