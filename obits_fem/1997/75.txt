        Hedwig G. Sulzle, who with her husband started a workshop atop a garage in central New York State in 1945 and built it into the world's largest independent manufacturer of surgical needles, died on Monday at her home in Syracuse. She was 97.
        She was the co-founder and for many years the principal manager of the B. G. Sulzle Company, a family enterprise with headquarters at 1 Needle Lane in North Syracuse. She curtailed her role in recent years, particularly after a shoulder injury in 1991.
        Mrs. Sulzle emigrated from Aachen, Germany, to the United States in 1928. She and her husband, Benjamin, began to produce their needles in a spare bedroom before moving the operation into the garage below. Their product derived from an innovative design and manufacturing process that Mr. Sulzle developed.
        It resulted in needles that caused far less damage to the surrounding tissue during surgery than had earlier designs. The couple incorporated the company in 1945. Those types of needle, known as atraumatic surgical needles, became standard in operating rooms.
        Mr. Sulzle died in 1963. His widow continued to manage B. G. Sulzle, assisted by a daughter and son-in-law, Lora and Alfred Flanagan.
        Mrs. Sulzle was a supporter of civic, health-care and cultural institutions, including the SUNY Health Science Center at Syracuse, which received an endowed visiting professorship, the B. G. Sulzle-Richard Burleson Memorial Lecture Series in surgery.
        Mrs. Sulzle is survived by two granddaughters who manage the company, Lee H. Flanagan of Syracuse, president, and Wendy R. Flanagan of Syracuse and Manhattan.
