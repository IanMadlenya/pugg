        Catherine Scorsese, the mother of the film director Martin Scorsese, who cast her in several of his films, died yesterday at New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 84.
        Mrs. Scorsese, the daughter of Sicilian immigrants, was born on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where she met her husband, Charles. She worked in the garment business.
        A lively personality with a colorful turn of speech, Mrs. Scorsese found what amounted to a second career in her son's films, in which she improvised her dialogue. Mr. Scorsese assigned her cameo roles in his early films ''It's Not Just You, Murray!'' and ''Who's That Knocking at My Door?''
        She went on to appear in ''Mean Streets,'' ''New York, New York,'' ''Goodfellas,'' ''Cape Fear,'' ''Casino'' and other films by her son, as well as ''Godfather III'' and ''Desperately Seeking Susan.'' She was a central figure in Mr. Scorsese's 1974  documentary ''Italianamerican.'' Her cookbook, ''Italianamerican: The Scorsese Family Cookbook,'' was recently published by Random House.
        In addition to her son Martin, she is survived by another son, Frank, of Staten Island, five grandchildren and one great-grandchild. Her husband died in 1993.
