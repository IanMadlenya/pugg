        Elaine Ryan Hedges, an author, educator and expert on the contributions of American women to literature and the arts, died on June 5 at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore. She was 69 and lived in Roland Park in suburban Baltimore.
        The cause was an aneurysm, according to Towson State University in Maryland, where she was professor emeritus of English and until last year directed the women's studies program, which she founded in 1972.
        Her program was one of the oldest and most respected of its kind in the country. She also shared her insights abroad, by lecturing in Beijing and in two stints as a visiting professor of American studies at the Freie Universitat in Berlin.
        Her writings were published in professional journals and books issued by the Feminist Press at the City University of New York, and elsewhere.
        Altogether, she wrote or edited a dozen books, including ''Ripening: Selected Works, 1927-1980'' (1982), an acclaimed compilation from the oeuvre of the radical feminist writer Meridel Le Sueur.
        Her edition of Charlotte Perkins Gilman's ''Yellow Wallpaper'' for Feminist Press in 1973 was considered a classic in feminist literary criticism. It also ranked among the 10 best-selling titles from university presses. Her most recent book, ''Listening to Silences'' (1994), was a collection of essays.
        Elaine Ryan was born in Yonkers and graduated from Barnard College in 1948. She received a master's degree in 1950 and a doctorate in 1970 from Harvard University. Before  joining Towson in 1967, she taught at Wellesley College in Massachusetts, San Francisco State College and Goucher College in Towson.
        Dr. Hedges is survived by her husband, Dr. William L. Hedges; a daughter, Marietta, and a son, James L., both of San Francisco; a sister, Dorothy Faye of Greenwich, Conn., and a granddaughter.
