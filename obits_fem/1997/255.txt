        Margaret Storrs Grierson, the former archivist of Smith College who built its Sophia Smith Collection into an international research center, died on Dec. 12 at the Linda Manor Extended Care Facility in Leeds, Mass. She was 97.
        Born in Denver, she graduated from Smith in 1922 and earned a doctorate seven years later at Bryn Mawr College, where she taught for several years. Returning to Smith, she taught philosophy until she was named archivist in 1940.
        In 1942 she took on the additional tasks of executive secretary of Friends of the Library and director of its fledgling Sophia Smith Collection. Named after the college's patron, the collection initially served as a repository of works by female writers but grew over the years into a women's history archive.
        From the modest beginning of the collection and until she retired in 1965, Dr. Grierson traveled the world to document the experience of women from the colonial era to the present. The collection now stretches over some 5,500 feet of shelves and includes materials about women's rights, suffrage, birth control, the women's movement of recent years  and women in the arts.
        Traditional historiography had often overlooked women's roles, and the Smith collection helped supply the records once researchers began their studies of women. Sherrill Redmon, director of the collection, called Dr. Grierson ''one of the unsung heroes who made the field of women's history possible.''
        Dr. Grierson is survived by a brother, Lucius S. Storrs Jr., of Tempe, Ariz.
