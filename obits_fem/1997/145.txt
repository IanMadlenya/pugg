        Sanjukta Panigrahi, a classical dancer from India who toured the United States as a foremost exponent of the Orissi style, died on June 24 at her home in Bhubaneshwar in the Indian state of Orissa. She was 65.
        She died of cancer, said the Indian dancer Indrani, who lives and teaches in New York City. The government of Orissa gave Sanjukta, as the dancer was known, a state funeral.
        The Orissi dance style, distinguished by a curved silhouette based on carved temple figures, was much less known throughout India and the world than the Bharata Natyam style from Madras when Sanjukta began performing it in the 1950's. The Asia Society brought her to New York and presented her on tour several times to familiarize American audiences with this singular school of Indian classical dance.
        Sanjukta, who had begun dancing at the age of 5, was the first professional dancer in Orissa who had not been a Mahari, or temple dancer, Indrani said.
        Sanjukta is survived by her husband, Ragunath Panigrahi, who provided the vocal accompaniment at  her concerts, and by two sons.
