        Jeannette E. Fleischner, a professor of education at Columbia University Teachers College who devoted her career to the advancement of children with disabilities, died last Saturday at Benedictine Hospital in Kingston, N.Y. She was 57 and lived in Woodstock, N.Y., and on Manhattan's Upper West Side.
        The cause was a ruptured aorta, her family said.
        At her death, Dr. Fleischner was director of the college's Program on the Learning and Physically Disabled as well as principal investigator in its Research Institute on Learning Disabilities. She began her career at Teachers College as an assistant professor and coordinator of the Special Education Child Study Center in 1974.
        Much of her work focused on the role of technology in the education of children with disabilities. Among other things, she developed strategies to teach skills to the children and programs for screening and evaluating the learning-disabled. Beyond her immediate concern for teaching, she sought to prepare students for the society they would live in as adults.
        Dr. Fleischner is survived by her husband, Peter; a daughter, Julia, of Manhattan; three sons, Robert, of Buffalo; Paul, of Phoenix, and Michael, of Princeton, N.J.; a brother, Patrick O'Shaughnessy of Chicago, and two grandchildren.
