        Dr. Florence Clothier Wislocki, a psychiatrist and former assistant to the president of Vassar College, died of a stroke Wednesday in the Charlton Memorial Hospital in Fall River, Mass. She was 83 years old and lived in Little Compton, R.I.
        Dr. Wislocki, who received her bachelor's degree at Vassar and her medical degree at the Johns Hopkins University, was a staff psychiatrist at a children's social services agency in Boston before she joined the Vassar College administration in 1957.
        From 1957 until 1969 she was assistant to two Vassar presidents, Sarah Gibson Blanding and Alan Simpson. During that time she was also secretary to the Vassar board of trustees. She had previously been a member of the board.
        After leaving Vassar she continued to work as a psychiatrist in Fall River until 1978. After retirement she devoted years to the cause of the living will and was president of the Society for the Right to Die.
        Her husband, Prof. George Wislocki of Harvard University, died in 1956. She is survived by two sons, George, of Pittsfield, Mass., and Dr. Louis, of Dedham, Mass.; two daughters, Edith Darby of Rehoboth, Mass., and Johanna McKenzie of Little Compton, and six grandchildren.
