        Margie Lynn Inman, who performed on the wings of airplanes in her youth and later battled local officials for the right to live in a lean-to with a menagerie of pets, has died at the age of 76.
        Mrs. Inman died Sept. 30, the day she was to have entered a nursing home after weeks of failing health, friends said.
        She performed as a wing-walker in the 1920's and '30s in the Inman Brothers Flying Circus with her husband, Rolley Roger Inman, a pilot. He died in a crash in 1944.
        Mrs. Inman began living in a lean-to on her property near Fort Lauderdale after her house collapsed in 1976. She spent much of her Social Security checks on food for her pet cats, dogs and rats, which she called ''my kids.'' Her disputes with neighbors and local officials over the animals ended when local people pitched in to help her clean up the property.
