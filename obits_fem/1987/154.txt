        Children in the same class could listen to one of four taped lessons made by the teacher. If a student wanted help, pressing a button would get the teacher's attention. The teacher in turn could communicate with any one student.
        Sister Mary Theresa told an interviewer at the time that she considered the system means of tailoring instruction to be closer to individuals' needs and farther from mass education.
        She was born on a farm in Kansas and took her vows in 1927. She was a graduate of Catholic University and the University of Kansas, where she received a doctorate in English.
