        A woman accused of throwing six of her seven children into a bayou, where two of them drowned, was sentenced to probation today after pleading no contest to murder and attempted capital murder.
        The woman, Juana Leija, entered the pleas as part of an agreement in which three charges of attempted capital murder were dismissed, her lawyer said.
        The lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, said Mrs. Leija's 10-year probation called for her to remain under the care of Harris County Mental Health and Mental Retardation officials.
        ''They agreed that she was mentally ill at the time that it happened,'' he said. ''She knows that at the time it happened she thought what she was doing was right.''
        Mrs. Leija, 30 years old, said at the time the world was a terrible place, and that her children would be better off dead.
        The prosecutor, Carol Davies, said probation was too light a sentence.
        ''There are a lot of women out there in difficult circumstances with children, and I would hate to think that anyone would think that this is an appropriate way to solve your problems,'' Ms. Davies said. Two of Mrs. Leija's children, 5-year-old Juana and 6-year-old Judas Dimas, drowned in the muddy waters of the bayou on April 18, 1986, but nearby workers heard the childrens' screams and rescued the other four.
