        Miss Bauersmith made her New York stage debut in 1931 in Ronald Jeans's ''Lean Harvest,'' after graduating from the Carnegie Institute of Technology. She was a member of the Actors Repertory and, later, the National Repertory Theater, appearing in ''Let Freedom Ring'' and, in 1936, in Irwin Shaw's antiwar drama ''Bury the Dead.'' Miss Bauersmith acted in Off Broadway productions and in stock, as well as in such theater-oriented television programs as ''Studio One,'' ''The U.S. Steel Hour'' and ''Kraft Television Theater.'' A crossword puzzle enthusiast, she was a regular contributor to The New York Times's puzzle page.
        Miss Bauersmith is survived by a daughter, Jennifer Warren, an actress living in Los Angeles; a son, Paul Warren, dean of the School of Education at Boston University, and three grandchildren. Miss Bauersmith's husband, Barnett M. Warren, died in 1953.
