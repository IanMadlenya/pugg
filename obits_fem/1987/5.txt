        Mrs. Longone would provide the musical and narrative accompaniment to an opera, which was given in concert version, in addition to selecting the artists who appeared in it. She scheduled her repertory according to the Metropolitan and New York City Opera seasons, giving her operalogue just before the first performance of each work. The weekly two-and-a-half-hour performances drew an audience of about 500 subscribers.
        Over the years, Mrs. Longone introduced new artists to her subscribers, including Beverly Sills, Robert Weede and Robert Merrill. She gave up the operalogues on her 80th birthday in 1972. Earlier in her career she toured Europe and the United States as an accompanist to Beniamino Gigli and Rosa Raisa.
