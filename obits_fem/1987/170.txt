        Raya Dunayevskaya, an author who was secretary to Leon Trotsky, died Tuesday in Sheridan Road Hospital, Chicago. A resident of Evanston, Ill., she was 77 years old.
        Miss Dunayevskaya was the author of four books, including ''Marxism and Freedom, From 1776 Until Today,'' published in 1958, an anti-Communist study of the American roots of Marxism.
        Born in Russia, she was brought to America at the age of 12. She became a secretary to Trotsky, the exiled Russian war minister, from 1937 to 1939. Trotsky was assassinated near Mexico City in 1940.
        She was a translator into English of works by Marx and Lenin. She lived in Detroit from 1953 to 1984. A collection of her papers is housed in the Archives of Labor and Urban Affairs of the Walter P. Reuther Library of Wayne State University in Detroit.
        Although married, she did not use the name of her husband, John Dwyer of Evanston, who survives. Also surving are two sisters, Bessie Gogol and Sonia Spiegel, both of Los Angeles.
