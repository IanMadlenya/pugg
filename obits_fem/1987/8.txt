        The Reverend Mother, a native New Yorker, was born Ruth Elaine Younger. She entered the Canadian Sisterhood of St. John the Divine in Toronto and took her final vows in 1922. She was a graduate of St. Hilda's College, University of Toronto, and earned a master's degree and a doctorate in education from Columbia University.
        She and a colleague, Sister Edith Margaret, founded St. Hilda's School in Morningside Heights in 1950. It later became St. Hilda's and St. Hugh's School, which offered coeducational academic training from nursery through the 12th grade. She was its headmistress until her retirement in 1985.
        In 1952, she was elected the Reverend Mother of the Community of the Holy Spirit, an Episcopal religious order for women that she founded that year. Under her direction, the group also founded the Melrose School in Brewster, N.Y., and St. Cuthbert's Retreat House.
