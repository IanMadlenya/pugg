        Fanny Butcher, the literary editor of The Chicago Tribune for 40 years, has died at the age of 99.
        Miss Butcher, who died Thursday at her apartment here, retired in 1963 after 50 years at The Tribune. She held a variety of posts besides literary editor, including society editor, fashion editor and crime reporter.
        But she was best known for her book reviews. In 1971, she published her memoirs, ''Many Lives, One Love,'' which chronicled her love of books.
        Among her close friends in the literary world were Bennett Cerf, Thornton Wilder, H. L. Mencken and the English playwright St. John Ervine. Her favorite writer, she said in a 1980 interview, was Ernest Hemingway. ''He was macho before the word was invented,'' she said.
        Miss Butcher, born in Fredonia, Kan., moved to Chicago with her family when she was a child and graduated from the University of Chicago in 1910. She married an advertising executive, Richard Bokum, in 1935. He died in 1963. There are no survivors.
