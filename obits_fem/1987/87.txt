        Edna Manley, a Caribbean artist and art patron and the widow of Jamaica's first Prime Minister and the mother of another, died Monday at her home, according to a family spokesman. She was 86 years old.
        ''The information we have is that Mrs. Manley died last night in her sleep,'' the spokesman said, giving no cause of death.
        Mrs. Manley was regarded as a major Caribbean and Latin American sculptor. At the same time, she was, as the wife of one of Jamaica's leading political figures, Norman Washington Manley, a major patron of the arts.
        In colonial Jamaica as early as 1937 she fostered art with her own work and by teaching a generation of Jamaican artists.
        She helped found Forum, a magazine in which young Caribbean poets and writers were often first published, and helped found the Jamaica Art School.
        Her own sculpture earned her international recognition, including exhibitions in France and England.
        Mrs. Manley was born Edna Swithenbank, in Hampshire, England, of a Jamaican mother and a British father. In 1921 she married her first cousin, a Rhodes scholar and lawyer who founded the People's National Party in Jamaica and helped lead his country to political independence in 1962. He died in 1969.
        Mrs. Manley is survived by two sons: Michael, leader of the party his father founded and Jamaica's Prime Minister from 1972 to 1980, and Douglas, a social scientist who served in his brother's Cabinet.
