        Mrs. Warburg was former vice president of the Girl Scouts of America and chairman of its camp committee. She was chairwoman of the board of the Maternity Center and of the Animal Medical Center, both in Manhattan.
        She was a board member of the Neurological Institute, the Loeb Convalescent Home, Montefiore Hospital, the Planned Parenthood Association, the Visiting Nurse Service and the Brearley School. She was a graduate of Brearley in 1913 and the second of what has since become five generations of her family to attend the Manhattan preparatory school.
        When Lord Louis Mountbatten established the United World Colleges - an international network of two-year colleges - after World War II, he asked Mrs. Rothschild to help organize the project and to serve on the American committee. She was also a member of the women's committee of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, of which her father was a founder.
        Mrs. Warburg was born in Manhattan, the daughter of Felix M. and Frieda Schiff Warburg. Her husband, Walter N. Rothschild, chairman of the board of Abraham & Straus and a founder of the Federated Department Stores, died in 1960.
        Mrs. Warburg is survived by a brother, Edward M. M. Warburg of Weston, Conn.; a son, Walter N. Jr., of Syosset, L.I. ; two daughters, Phyllis Farley of Manhattan and Carol Noyes of Syosset; 13 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.
