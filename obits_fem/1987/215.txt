        Ethel Westheimer Price, known in the fashion world as ''Emme'' for her custom-made millinery, died as the result of internal hemorrhaging Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 85 years old.
        Mrs. Rice, who was born in Manhattan, started in business in the mid-1920's and carried on long after ready-to-wear had swept the millinery field. She retired in 1970.  With her colleague, Adolfo, she created hats for the well-to-do and for Mamie Eisenhower, Jacqueline Kennedy and Pat Nixon. She also had a following among the film stars in the years after World War II, including Rosalind Russell and Joan Crawford.
        Later, she and Adolfo parted company and Adolfo turned to designing fashions on his own.
        Her husband, Irving Price, a manufacturer of small appliances, died in 1962.
        Mrs. Price is survived by a daughter, Claire Krischok of Manhattan; a brother, Sol Westheimer, also of Manhattan; two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
        A funeral service will be held at 10:15 A.M. Sunday at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street.
