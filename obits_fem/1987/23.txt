        Dr. Edwards, a gynecologist and obstetrician, was born in Washington and graduated from Howard University and its medical school. In 1925 she established a practice in Jersey City, where her husband, Dr. Keith L. Madison, who died in 1980, had a general practice. In 1931, Dr. Edwards was one of the first doctors appointed to the staff of the Margaret Hague Maternity Hospital in Jersey City.
