        Mrs. Glover was treasurer and a director of the nonsectarian Sunshine Nurseries, two pioneering day-care centers started in the early 1920's in East Harlem and the Bronx. Her mother, the late Louise Kalmus, was one of the founders of the centers, which were taken over by the New York City Department of Human Resources in 1978.
        Mrs. Glover was born in New York City. She graduated from the Fieldston School and from Wellesley College, with honors, in 1941. She had been an officer of the Scarsdale League of Women Voters and chairman of the Scarsdale Parent-Teachers Association.
        She is survived by her husband, Stuart B. Glover; a brother, Allan H. Kalmus of Manhattan; two sons, James D., of White Plains, and Richard K., of Stamford, Conn., and four grandchildren.
