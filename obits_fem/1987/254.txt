        As president of Castelli Graphics, on East 77th Street, Mrs. Castelli showed such major artists as Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg and James Rosenquist, who were also affiliated with the galleries of Leo Castelli, her husband. But she ran her gallery independently and also exhibited such artists as Robert Cumming, Bernard Faucon and Pat Steir.
        Mrs. Castelli was born near Limoges, France, and spent most of her early life in Paris. She married Mr. Castelli in 1963.
        In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Jean-Christophe; her mother, Edmee Haviland, and two sisters.
