        Flora Scalamandre, a co-founder of Scalamandre Silks Inc., one of the largest manufacturers of silk fabrics on the East Coast, died Friday after a heart attack at her home in Plandome Manor, L.I. She was 80 years old.
        Mrs. Scalamandre, an artist and designer, founded the company in 1929 with her husband, Franco. In the 1950's, the company had more than 200 silk looms going night and day in Long Island City, Queens, and in Paterson, N.J. Scalamandre Silks now has 425 employees and does $30 million worth of business in silk annually.
        The company has concentrated on drapery and upholstery fabrics, and its designs are used by decorators and featured in historical restorations.
        Mrs. Scalamandre graduated from the Parsons School of Design in 1925 and later that year went to the Sorbonne on a scholarship. After returning to New York, she worked with her father, Gino Baranzelli, on designs for the exterior of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.
        Besides her husband, she is survived by a son, Gino; a daughter, Adriana Scalamandre Bitter; seven grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.
