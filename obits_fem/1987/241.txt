        Rachel Anne Rabinowicz, editor of a Passover Haggadah, died of cancer Monday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 46 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She edited the Haggadah, ''Feast of Freedom,'' for the Rabbinical Assembly, an organization of Conservative rabbis. An Haggadah is the narrative read aloud at the Passover seder. The volume is one of the few Jewish liturgical works to be edited by a woman. Recently, she completed a book on the Jewish high holidays to be published by the Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith.
        She was born in London and graduated from London University. She worked as a copywriter for Avon Products.
        She is survived by a sister, Miriam Rabinowicz of New York, and a brother, Rabbi Harry Rabinowicz, of London.
