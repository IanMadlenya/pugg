        Born in Pittsburgh, Mrs. Walker was an art student at the Carnegie Institute of Technology from 1933 to 1934, then moved to New York, where she studied dance with Ruth St. Denis. In 1936 she married Hudson D. Walker, an art historian, and from 1936 to 1940 the two operated the Hudson D. Walker Gallery on 57th Street, where they showed the work of such artists as Marsden Hartley, Mervyn Jules, Joseph Hirsch and Harry Sternberg.
        Mrs. Walker exhibited her own paintings at the Bertha Schaefer Gallery in New York and the Provincetown Art Museum. In 1967, she and her husband helped to found the Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown, which provides fellowships for emerging artists and writers. She was also a founder of the Provincetown Symphony Society and was its president from 1954 to 1958.
        Mrs. Walker's husband died in 1976. She is survived by three daughters, Harriet Heron of Medford Lakes, N.J., Berta B. Walker of New York, and Louise W. Walker of Central Middlesex, Mass., and four grandchildren.
        A memorial service will be held tomorrow at 3 P.M. at St. Mary's of the Harbor Church in Provincetown.
