        Marion Hutton, a vocalist with the Glenn Miller Orchestra who for the last 20 years worked to help rehabilitate female alcoholics, died of cancer Saturday at her home in Kirkland, Wash. She was 67 years old.
        Miss Hutton sang with the Miller band from 1939 until the band leader joined the United States Army Air Corps in World War II. Songs she was identified with included ''Kalamazoo,'' ''Chatanooga Choo Choo,'' ''Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree,'' 'Moonlight Serenade'' and ''I'll Be Seeing You.''
        She acted in movies including ''Love Happy'' with the Marx Brothers, ''In Society'' with the comedy team of Abbott and Costello, and others with Perry Como, Bob Hope and Jack Carson.
        In 1965 she sought treatment for alcoholism and addiction to certain prescription drugs. Thereafter she devoted her energies to helping alcoholics and establishing treatment programs in California prisons. In 1981 she founded Residence XII, a treatment center for female alcoholics in Kirkland, and was its executive director.
        Miss Hutton is survived by her husband, Victor Schoen; three sons, and her sister, Betty Hutton, the actress and singer.
