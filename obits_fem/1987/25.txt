        Mrs. Martin, who had been on the board of Gonzaga University in Spokane since 1978, gave $4.5 million in 1985 for construction of the school's Charlotte Y. Martin Center. Martin Stadium at Washington State University in Pullman is a memorial established by Mrs. Martin and her husband, Clarence D. (Dan) Martin Jr., in honor of his father, Clarence Martin, who was Governor of Washington from 1933 to 1941. The Martins also financed scholarships at Gonzaga.
        Dan Martin was Undersecretary of Commerce under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson.
