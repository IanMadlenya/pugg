        Mrs. Loeb had been with the organization since 1947, two years after graduating from Bryn Mawr College. Her first position was assistant to the executive director. She later became a trustee and treasurer. She resigned only recently because of ill health.
        She is survived by her husband, John; a son, David, of San Francisco; a daughter, Virginia, of Cambridge, Mass.; her mother, Diana P. Haslam of London; three half brothers, Michael, John and Nicholas Haslam, all of London, and two grandsons.
