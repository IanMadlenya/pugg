        Harriett Johnson, music critic of The New York Post for 43 years, died of cancer Friday in La Jolla, Calif. She was 79 years old.
        Miss Johnson's critical concentration was in vocal music, and her friendly and supportive reviews made her a well-liked and respected visitor to opera houses. She went to The Post in 1943 after working as a lecturer and broadcaster, and continued to review for the paper up to the first week of concerts in the renovated Carnegie Hall last December.
        Miss Johnson was born in Minneapolis and trained in music at the University of Minnesota and at the Juilliard School, where she studied piano with Olga Samaroff. While active as a critic, she composed music for young audiences; in 1954 The New York Times reported that her ''Chuggy and the Blue Caboose'' held its audience ''in rapt attention,'' and that it was ''a mild and charming piece.''
        She is survived by a son, Craig Norville.
        A memorial service will be held today at 1 P.M. at the Church of Sweden, 5 East 48th Street.
