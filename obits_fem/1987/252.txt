        Victoria Kent, the first woman to become a lawyer in Spain and the founder and former editor of Iberica, a magazine that opposed Communism in Spain and the Government of Franco, died of a heart attack Friday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan.
        She was 90 years old and had lived in Manhattan for the last 37 years.
        Born in Malaga, Spain, in 1897, she spent her youth in Madrid, where she studied at the University of Madrid. She was the first woman to argue before the Spanish Royal Tribunal of Law, where she successfully defended rebel leaders.
        After the overthrow of the Spanish monarchy in 1931, the leaders of the Republican Government placed her in charge of making changes in the country's prison system. During the Spanish Civil War she worked in Paris, aiding refugees from Spain.
        When German forces occupied Paris in World War II, Miss Kent sought refuge in the Mexican Embassy. After the liberation of Paris she moved to Mexico, where she lectured on penal law at the University of Mexico.
        In 1950, she moved to New York City, where she worked for the United Nations and established Iberica. Earlier this year she was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of San Raimundo of Penafort by the King of Spain.
        Miss Kent is survived by a nephew, Jose Maria O'Kean of Seville, Spain.
