        Sylvia Lewis, former director of the 92d Street Y Nursery School, died Friday after a long illness at her home in Manhattan. She was 81 years old.
        Mrs. Lewis was director of the nursery school from 1968 until her retirement in 1975. She played a major role in developing the school's preschool education program, which emphasized Jewish culture.
        Before becoming director of the school, Mrs. Lewis had taught there for more than 10 years.
        ''She was unbelievably gifted in every way,'' said Emily Rosenthal, who directed the school from 1946 to 1966, ''The children loved her.''
        Born in Manhattan in 1906, Mrs. Lewis married Kassel Lewis in 1925. She was graduated in 1927 from Barnard College, where she studied English.
        Mrs. Lewis is survived by her son, Anthony Lewis, a columnist of The New York Times, a sister, Frieda Berg of the Riverdale section of the Bronx, and nine grandchildren.
