        Norma B. Watson, one of the first women to serve in the Marine Corps, died on Aug. 8 at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Coatesville, Pa., after a stroke. She was 90 years old and lived in Scullville, N.J.
        She was one of a group of women who enlisted in the Marines in 1918 to free men for combat duty. The ''marinettes,'' as they were referred to unofficially, were assigned to clerical duties. She was assigned as a secretary to a Philadelphia recruiting officer.
        A similar group of women who served in the Navy in World War I were referred to as ''yeomanettes,'' and Mrs. Watson's oldest sister was serving at the time with that group.
        A Marine Corps honor guard attended Mrs. Watson's burial Thursday at Arlington Cemetery in Drexel Hill, Pa.
        Mrs. Watson, who was born in Philadelphia, worked for almost 40 years for B. Altman & Company department store in Manhattan. Before that she was a designer of women's knitwear products. She had also been a set designer and actress with a theatrical group in Brooklyn called the Neighborhood Players.
        She is survived by two sons, James of Schwenksville, Pa., and Dirk of Tenafly, N.J.; a sister, Dorothy C. Parker of Fort Washington, Pa.; seven grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.
