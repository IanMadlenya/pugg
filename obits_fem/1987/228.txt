        Minna Harkavy, a sculptor whose works are in the permanent collections of several major museums, died Sunday in the Bronx. She was 101 years old.
        Miss Harkavy was born in Estonia, and emigrated with her family to the United States around 1900. With the exception of the 1920's and early 30's, when she joined the many expatriate American artists living in Paris, she was a resident of New York City for most of her life.
        Many of her often oversized sculptures of heads or figures in stone, bronze and clay reflected her social and political concerns. One of her best-known creations, ''The Miners,'' is owned by the Museum of Modern Art. Her works were exhibited widely in the United States and Europe between the 1930's and 1960's, and several of her pieces are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, the Hermitage Museum in Leningrad and the Pushkin Museum in Moscow.
        Her works were featured in a recent show at New York's ACA Gallery, commemorating the now-defunct New York Society of Women Artists. Miss Harkavy was among the founders of the group, which was devoted to avant-garde women artists. She also taught sculpture for many years in her penthouse studio at the Ansonia Hotel, and did many commissioned busts.
        Ms. Harkavy had no survivors.
