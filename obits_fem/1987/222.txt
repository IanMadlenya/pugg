        Sheila van Damm, the top British woman in auto racing in the 1950's and former owner of the Windmill Theater in London, died Sunday. She was 65 years old.
        Miss van Damm began driving in car rallies in 1950. She won the Coupe des Dames, the highest award for women, in the 1953 Alpine Rally. Miss van Damm also won the Women's European Touring Championship in 1954 and the Coupe des Dames in the 1955 Monte Carlo Rally.
        She inherited the Windmill Theater from her father when he died in 1960. The theater, which remained open at the height of the blitz in September 1940, became famous as a place where showgirls appeared nearly nude, and as a training ground for young comedians, including Peter Sellers.
