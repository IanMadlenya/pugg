        Ms. Simpson was on a three-week tour of South Africa in defiance of the United Nations cultural boycott against the country. The soprano, who is black, said she came to South Africa to bring ''a message of love and to spread goodwill.''
        She was performing a spiritual, ''Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child,'' at Cape Town's City Hall Thursday night when she collapsed. Doctors from the audience came to her aid, and she was taken to the hospital.
        Ms. Simpson came from a singing family. Her mother and father, and her five sisters and two brothers have been singing for many years as the Simpson Family Singers.
        She performed with Opera North in Philadelphia and with the Metropolitan Opera in New York. She had toured many countries, including the Soviet Union.
