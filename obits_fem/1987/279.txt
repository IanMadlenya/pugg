        President and Mrs. Reagan will travel to Phoenix Tuesday morning, and the President will return to Washington Tuesday night, leaving Mrs. Reagan behind. Mr. Reagan will return to Arizona for the funeral, when arrangements are completed, the White House said.
        Mrs. Davis, who went by the name ''Lucky,'' had been in poor health for the last several years. The White House said she died at 12:15 P.M., mountain standard time. Mrs. Reagan was at the White House when told of her mother's death. Career as an Actress
        Mrs. Davis began work as an actress at the age of 15 and appeared in several films, including ''The Other Girl'' in 1915. She also acted on stage, in New York and with several regional stock companies. Her last Broadway appearance was in 1928 when she played with Walter Huston and Kay Francis in ''Elmer the Great.''
        Her first marriage, to Kenneth Robbins of Pittsfield, Mass., ended in divorce. In 1929 she met and married Dr. Loyal Davis, a Chicago neurosurgeon.
        Mrs. Davis performed volunteer work in various areas of health care for more than 50 years. She served on several boards and foundations. She also served as honorary chairman of the women's division of United Cerebral Palsy.
        After Dr. Davis retired as head of the surgery department at Northwestern University in 1963, she moved with him to Phoenix. Dr. Davis died in 1982.
        In 1983 Mrs. Davis was awarded the Arizona Lifetime Achievement Award by the Association for Retarded Citizens.
        She is survived by one daugther, Mrs. Reagan; one son, Richard Davis of Philadelphia, and seven grandchildren.
