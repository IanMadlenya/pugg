        Mrs. Orkin, who was born in Brooklyn, worked in vaudeville and as a silent screen actress in Hollywood through the early 1920's. She was a piano teacher in Los Angeles until the 1940's, after which she returned to New York. She turned to painting in the early 1960's after becoming hard of hearing.
        Her works were widely reproduced in magazines and were shown in several New York gallery exhbitions, including shows at the Park South Gallery in 1971, and at the Witkin Gallery in 1981. The latter was a joint exhibition with her daughter, the photographer Ruth Orkin, who was best-known for her photographs of Central Park before her death in 1985.
        There were no immdiate survivors.
