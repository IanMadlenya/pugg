        Miss Attaway, who was born in Mississippi and graduated from the University of Illinois, made her Broadway debut in 1936 in ''You Can't Take It With You.'' During the next 40 years, she appeared in many Broadway, Off Broadway and summer stock productions, and was with the Repertory Society of Lincoln Center from 1964 to 1967. She also did radio and television shows, and was in several films, among them ''Porgy and Bess,'' ''Raintree County'' and ''Being There.''
        Miss Attaway was the first director of the New York Players Guild, a black repertory theater company formed in New York in 1945. She was also trained as a social worker and, between acting jobs, worked with the American Red Cross, the New York State Department of Social Welfare and New York's Metropolitan Hospital.
        Miss Attaway is survived by a sister, Florence Miller, of Chicago.
