        Mrs. Barney died at home after a long illness.
        Her parents, Frank and Lillian M. Gilbreth, were pioneers in time-motion studies. The books and films offered amusing accounts about the father's attempts to use modern management techniques on the 12 children.
        The books ''Cheaper by the Dozen'' and ''Belles on their Toes'' were written by Mrs. Barney's sister, Ernestine G. Carey, who lives in Scottsdale, Ariz., and brother, Frank Jr., who lives in Charleston, S.C.
        Nine siblings survive Mrs. Barney. She is also survived by three sons and five grandchildren.
