        Lynn Caine, a former publicity agent for a publishing house who became a best-selling author, died of cancer Wednesday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 63 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mrs. Caine wrote four nonfiction books, ''Widow'' (1974), ''What Did I Do Wrong? Mothers, Children, Guilt'' (1977), ''Lifelines'' (1978) and her last book, tentatively titled ''Lynn Caine's Book for Widows,'' which is to be published next fall.
        ''Widow,'' which was adapted for television in 1976, came out of Mrs. Caine's experiences after the death of her husband, Martin., in 1971. The book reflected her life as the surviving parent of a son and daughter, ages 9 and 5.
        Mrs. Caine worked for the Little, Brown publishing house from 1967 to 1976. Since then she worked on her books and lectured.
        Mrs. Caine is survived by her son, Jonathan Saul, and her daughter, Elizabeth.
