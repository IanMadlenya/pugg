        Wynne Gibson, known for her wordless role as a suddenly rich lady of the night in the 1930's movie ''If I Had a Million,'' died on May 14 in a nursing home in Laguna Niguel, Calif. She was 81 years old, and had suffered a stroke.
        Miss Gibson, who served on the board of Actors' Equity and as chairwoman of the Equity Library Theater, had starring or featured parts in more than 30 movies, as well as roles on Broadway, radio and television.
        In the 1932 production of ''If I Had a Million,'' she was one of a series of stars - including Charles Laughton, George Raft, Gary Cooper and W. C. Fields - who performed separate sequences.
        A native of New York, Miss Gibson ran away from school at age 16 and landed a job in a chorus line on Broadway. That job lasted only two weeks because Ray Raymond, a vaudeville dancer, spotted her on stage and asked her to be his partner. Within a year, she won the role of the flapper in the touring company of ''The Gingham Girl,'' and soon after was signed to the title role of ''Little Jessie James.''
        Among her other movie roles were ''I Give My Love,'' ''The Captain Hates the Sea,'' ''Her Bodyguard'' and ''The Crime of the Century.''
        Miss Gibson had no survivors.
