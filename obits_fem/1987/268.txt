        Dr. Emily Mumford, a sociologist known for her work on the effect of psychotherapy in lowering later medical care costs, died of complications of a brain tumor Oct. 3 at her home in Manhattan. She was 66 years old.
        Dr. Mumford was professor of clinical sociomedical sciences in psychiatry and public health at the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University and chief of the division of health utilization and policy research at the New York Psychiatric Institute.
        Studies in which she took part reported that the person who undergoes psychotherapy develops a healthier style of living and is less apt to require unneeded hospitalization. Thus the cost of psychotherapy is offset, the studies showed.
        Dr. Mumford's writings included a textbook on medical sociology, ''Interns: From Students to Physicians.''
        She was born in Missouri and graduated from the University of Tulsa in Oklahoma. While working as a magazine editor, she took courses at Columbia University that drew her toward sociology. She received a master's degree and doctorate in sociology from Columbia.
        She is survived by her husband, Dr. Herbert J. Schlesinger, who is Albert J. Marrow Professor of Psychology at the New School for Social Research.
