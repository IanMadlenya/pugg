       Ruth G. Bonner, mother-in-law of the Soviet physicist Andrei D. Sakharov and a victim of Stalin's purges in the late 1930's, died Friday at the age of 87, her daughter Yelena G. Bonner said today.
        Ruth G. Bonner, mother-in-law of the Soviet physicist Andrei D. Sakharov and a victim of Stalin's purges in the late 1930's, died Friday at the age of 87, her daughter Yelena G. Bonner said today.
        She said her mother died of a brain hemorrhage in her sleep after a long illness.
        Ruth Bonner was an official of the Moscow City Communist Party committee when she was arrested in 1937, and she spent the next 17 years in labor camp or in exile.
        Her husband, Georg Alikhanov, then personnel director of Comintern, the Communist International, had been arrested a few days earlier in a mass purge of senior officials of the organization. Like many Comintern colleagues, he was accused of espionage for foreign countries and executed.
        Yelena Bonner said her mother, who was among the first of Stalin's victims to be rehabilitated by Khrushchev, was never able to work again after her release in 1954.
        Mr. Alikhanov was rehabilitated posthumously.
        When Mr. Sakharov and his wife were sent into internal exile to the Volga city of Gorky in 1980 because of their human rights activities, Ruth Bonner was allowed to go to the United States to live with her grandchildren, who had emigrated in the 1970's.
        She returned to live with the Sakharovs last June, six months after the Sakharovs were allowed to return to Moscow.
        Yelena Bonner said she hoped her son, Alexei, and her daughter, Tatyana, would be granted visas to attend the funeral, which she said would probably be held Tuesday.
