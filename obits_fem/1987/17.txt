        Esther Greenberg, the wife of former State Senator Samuel L. Greenberg, died Wednesday at Florida Medical Center in Lauderdale Lakes. She was 87 years old and lived in Tamarac, Fla.
        Mrs. Greenberg, for many years a Brooklyn resident, was responsible in the late 60's for the passage of a bill in the State Senate that required most new cars to have a windshield wiper on rear windows. The bill, sponsored by her husband and for which she lobbied for more than a year, grew out an experience the couple had driving in a snowstorm.
        In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Gloria Mae St. Lifer, two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
