        Helenka Adamowska Pantaleoni, who served for more than 25 years as president of the United States Committee for Unicef, the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, died of cardiac arrest Monday at New York Hospital. She was 86 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mrs. Pantaleoni was born into a family of prominent turn-of-the-century Polish musicians, the Adamowski Trio, which toured extensively in Europe and the United States before settling in Brookline, Mass., where she was born.
        After serving in the fund-raising arm of Polish War Relief, she helped to found Unicef and in 1953 became head of its United States Committee, a post she held until her retirement in 1978. During her presidency the committee raised $113 million for the fund.
        Mrs. Pantaleoni is survived by a brother, Tadeusz Adamowski of New York; by four sons, Michael and Anthony of New York, Guido 3d of Bronxville, N.Y., and Hewitt of Oneonta, N.Y.; a daughter, Nina Hillgarth of Toronto, and 14 grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
