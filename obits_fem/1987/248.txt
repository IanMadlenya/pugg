        Miss Rittler taught at the Edward S. Harkness Eye Institute at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons from 1936 until her retirement in 1971. She helped develop the ruby laser to treat eye disorders.
        When Terence Cardinal Cooke was a seminarian, Miss Rittler realized his vision problem was aniseikonia, a condition in which the perceived image appears larger in one eye than in the other, and she oversaw the grinding of special lenses for him.
        Surviving is a sister, Shirley Rittler Lang of Baltimore.
