        Dana Suesse, a composer and songwriter whose hits included ''You Ought to Be in Pictures,'' died of a stroke last Friday in New York City. She was 76 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Miss Suesse, who also wrote ''Whistling in the Dark,'' ''My Silent Love'' and ''Blue Moonlight,'' achieved widespread fame in 1932 when the orchestra leader Paul Whiteman commissioned her to write a jazz concerto for piano and orchestra. The work, ''Concerto in Three Rhythms,'' was such a success that the next year, another Whiteman commission, ''Symphonic Waltzes,'' followed.
        Miss Suesse, who was born in Shreveport, La., in 1911, came to New York in 1931 with her mother, an opera singer, and began working as a songwriter; her first hit was ''Have You Forgotten?'' in 1931. Her best-known song, ''You Ought to Be in Pictures,'' written in 1934 with Edward Heyman, has remained Hollywood's anthem for 52 years.
        In 1936 she wrote the score for Billy Rose's ''Casa Manana'' revue, and later collaborated with him on his ''Aquacade'' revue at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Miss Suesse also worked with the lyricists Harold Adamson, E. Y. Harburg, Irving Kahl and Leo Robin.
        In the late 1940's, Miss Suesse studied composition with Nadia Boulanger. She was also a pianist, and appeared as soloist in many of her own works.
        Miss Suesse is survived by her stepson, Charles DeLincks.
