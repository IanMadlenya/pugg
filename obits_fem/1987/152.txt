        Mrs. Ijams was a collateral descendant of Mother Elizabeth Bayley Seton, the first native-born American to become a saint. In 1917, she joined the board of the Virginia Day Nursery, which her mother helped found in 1879, and remained on the board until her death. She was also active on the boards of the Community Service Society and the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies.
        She is survived by three sons, Seton, of Bowdoinham, Me., Maitland, of Barneveld, N.Y., and Porter, of Locust Valley, L.I.; nine grandchildren, and one great grandchild.
