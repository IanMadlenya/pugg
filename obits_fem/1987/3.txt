        A native New Yorker, Mrs. Reyher lived in Manhattan on and off for most of her life. As a young suffragist, she held street meetings on women's causes and was head of the Boston and New York offices of the National Woman's Party.
        Beginning in 1924, Mrs. Reyher made six trips to Africa, which resulted in numerous articles and two books on life in Africa, ''Zulu Woman'' (1948) and ''The Fon and His Hundred Wives'' (1952). She later lectured on women and Africa at schools and colleges, including New York University and the New School for Social Research. Her collection of African artifacts was presented to Westbrook College in Portland, Me., as the Sinon collection.
        Her marriage in 1917 to the late Ferdinand Reyher, a writer, ended in divorce in 1934.
        In addition to her daughter, three grandsons and two great-grandchildren survive.
