        Elisabeth Coit, an architect and specialist on low-income housing, died last Thursday at a nursing home in Amherst, Mass. She was 94 years old and lived in Manhattan and Rockport, Mass.
        Miss Coit attained prominence in 1941 with the publication of her report ''Notes on the Design and Construction of the Dwelling Unit for the Low-Income Family.'' The report showed how low-income residents used their dwellings and argued that their point of view should be the primary concern in planning public housing.
        In 1970, Mayor John V. Lindsay appointed Miss Coit to the Landmarks Preservation Commission and, in 1969, she received an award as a Pioneer in Architecture from the New York City chapter of the American Institute of Architects.
        She is survived by a brother, Robert, of Rockport, and six nieces and nephews.
