        Belle Linsky, an art collector and philanthropist, died Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 83 years old.
        Mrs. Linsky, whose husband, Jack, accumulated a fortune as a manufacturer of stapling machines and office stationery, donated their collection of European art from the Renaissance and later periods to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1982, two years after the death of her husband.
        The 380 donated objects, many of them acknowledged masterpieces, were acquired over 40 years by the Linskys and were valued at $60 million. They are housed in the Jack and Belle Linsky Galleries at the museum.
        Mrs. Linsky and her husband also endowed a pavilion that bears their names at the Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan.
        She is survived by two daughters, Lenore Hecht of Manhattan and Muriel Karasik of Kings Point, L.I.; seven grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.
