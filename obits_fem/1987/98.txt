        Matilda W. Salpeter, a retired New York City elementary school teacher and principal who established the child-care All-Day Neighborhood School Program, died Tuesday at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx. She was 96 years old and lived in Brooklyn.
        In 1940, when Mrs. Salpeter was appointed principal of Public School 144 in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, she founded the All-Day Neighborhood School Progam in city schools, and conducted the program in her school. The program was the forerunner of today's after-school day-care program for school children of working mothers.
        She taught in the city's elementary schools for more than 50 years, starting in 1909. After she retired she was a volunteer in the day-care program as a principal emeritus.
        Mrs. Salpeter was born in Manhattan and was a graduate of Brooklyn Training School for Teachers and earned additional degrees at City College.
        She is survived by two daughters, Janet S. Sainer of Manhattan, who is Commissioner of the New York City Department for the Aging, and Gladys Kraft, of Washington; seven grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
