        Helen Lightbody, the nanny who cared for Prince Charles and Princess Anne and was known as ''No Nonsense Lightbody,'' died in Hawick, Scotland, on Saturday, Buckingham Palace said today. She was 79 years old.
        Miss Lightbody served as nanny to Princes William and Richard, sons of the Queen's uncle, the Duke of Gloucester, then ran the Buckingham Palace nursery from 1948, when Prince Charles was a month old, until she resigned in 1956. Press reports at the time said she incurred the displeasure of the Queen for being too strict.
