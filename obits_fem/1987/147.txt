        Bebe Simon, owner of the Uncle Sam Umbrella Shops in Manhattan, died Friday at St. Clare's Hospital after a heart attack. She was 79 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        The shops, which make, sell and repair umbrellas and canes, have catered to Presidents from Theodore Roosevelt to Harry S. Truman.
        Mrs. Simon was the widow of Norman Simon, who operated the shops from 1956 until his death in 1980, when his wife took over.
        The first Uncle Sam shop was opened in 1866 on the Bowery by Mr. Simon's grandfather. The shops, which also made the parasols for the stage production of ''My Fair Lady,'' currently have an outlet on West 57th Street, opposite Carnegie Hall. Another on East 46th Street is being relocated.
        Mrs. Simon ran the business daily, her family reported, and the shops now pass to yet another generation, her grandson Gary Schwartz. She is also survived by a daughter, Sandra Schwartz, and a sister, Beatrice Abbe of Scarsdale, N.Y.
