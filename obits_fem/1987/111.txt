        Mrs. Frankel, born and raised in Brooklyn, was a graduate of Barnard College and held master's degrees from the Harvard School of Education and the Columbia School of Business. She was the wife of Max Frankel, executive editor of The New York Times, and pursued a varied career suited to the frequent changes in his assignments.
        She wrote articles for The Times from the Soviet Union and, after her return, a historical book, ''The Russian Artist.'' In Washington, she taught history and Russian language and was an editor for The National Jewish Monthly. In New York, she was an editor at Newsday and marketing director for the City Opera. She was to receive a law degree this spring.
        Surviving Mrs. Frankel besides her husband are her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Harold M. Brown; a sister, MarionJust of Westwood, Mass., and three children, David, Margot and Jonathan, all of New York.
        The funeral will be held today at 12:30 P.M. at the Plaza Memorial Chapel, Amsterdam Avenue and 91st Street.
