        Mrs. Hodges was head stewardess aboard the ship when she caught fire on Sept. 8, 1934, off the coast of New Jersey, killing 134 of 548 passengers.
        According to reports, she was one of the last to leave the flaming ship. In ing the ordeal, Mrs. Hodges ripped up her undergarments so she could give people damp cloths to put over the face to filter the smoke.
        At the urging of others, she finally agreed to leave the ship if they would help a small boy who was hanging by a rope over the side of the ship. The boy was rescued.
