        Marie Kryl, a concert pianist who appeared with the Chicago, Cincinnati and St. Louis Symphony Orchestras, died Sunday in Orlando, Fla. She was 90 years old.
        Miss Kryl was born in Philadelphia on July 4, 1897, but lived most of her early life in Chicago, where she studied with the well-known pianist and teacher Rudolph Ganz.
        Her father, Bohumir Kryl, a bank president, art collector, composer and bandmaster, so wanted his daughters, Marie and Josephine, to become musicians that, in 1921, he promised them each $100,000 if they would not marry before reaching age 30. They both agreed.
        But neither daughter lived up to her vow. Josephine, a violinist of note, married the composer Paul Taylor White before turning 30. Marie forfeited her fortune when, in 1926, she became engaged to a Greek Count, Spiro Hadji-Kyriacos. A year later, however, the engagement was broken, and in 1932, she married Michel Gusikoff, a composer and a former assistant conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony.
