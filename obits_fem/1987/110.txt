        ''I was brought up to believe that one should contribute to the community somehow,'' Mrs. Campbell said in an interview last year, ''and the Washington Square Music Festival is my baby.'' The festival, which presents free chamber-orchestra concerts in Washington Square Park every summer, was founded in 1953 by the violinist Alexander Schneider and the Washington Square Association.
        ''Alexander Schneider suggested producing concerts in the square,'' Mrs. Campbell recalled last year. ''The idea worked, and then it fell to me to take it over. My husband asked me what I knew about music. Well, I didn't know very much, but I've learned a lot.'' In the festival's early days, Mrs. Campbell used to carry scrapbooks and petitions to local businesses and corporations to keep the festival solvent. In 1953, the entire budget was $1,300; last year's festival, which presented four concerts, had a budget of $30,000. A Grove Street Resident

        Mrs. Campbell is survived by a daughter, Peggy Friedman, and two grandchildren, Matthew and Susannah Friedman, all of Manhattan.
        There will be a memorial service Friday at 11 A.M. at Grace Episcopal Church, 801 Broadway, at 10th Street.
