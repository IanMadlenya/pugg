        Elsa de Brun, who painted under the Gaelic name of Nuala, died last night at her home in Manhattan. She was 91 years old and had suffered from Alzheimer's disease.
        Nuala's lyrical abstractions hang at Carnegie Hall, the Bymusbun Museum in Copenhagen, the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington and at the University of Texas.
        Nuala did not become a recognized artist until she was a grandmother. Her talent was first discovered by her manager-companion of more than 40 years, Patric Farrell, the former director of the Museum of Irish Art and the Irish Theater in Manhattan's Sheridan Square in the 1920's.
        They were married at Carnegie Hall on June 14, 1984, in front of her brightly illuminated stained-glass window, adpated from her pastel painting, ''Pleasure in Eternal Tumult.''
        The artist was born in Stockholm and was educated there at the Anna Sandstrom School.
        When she was 19, she moved with her family to New York City, where her father was an engineer engaged in import-export trade. It was not until 1946 that she began the fine-line pencil drawings that developed into her own style.
        Among her most noted pastels was a collection of 43 paintings titled ''Valentines for James Joyce,'' based on ''Finnegans Wake,'' that was purchased by the University of Texas in Austin where it is housed in the Humanities Center.
        Survivors, in addition to her husband, are a son by a previous marriage, the Rev. Guy de Brun, of Waxhaw, N.C.; a stepdaughter, Mrs. Laurance Wilson, of Kalamazoo, Mich.; 8 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.
