        Marion E. Martin, founder of the National Federation of Republican Women's Clubs, died Thursday at her home here. She was 86 years old.
        Miss Martin also was assistant chairman of the Republican National Committee.
        She was educated at Wellesley College, Mass., and the University of Maine. Her political career began in 1930 with her election to the Maine House. She was re-elected to a second term, then won two terms in the State Senate.
        She was the only woman and nonlawyer on the Senate's Legal Affairs Committee. On that panel, she once said, she ''could get just so far in an argument, then I'd hit a stone wall of legal phraseology - so I studied law in self-defense.'' Between legislative sessions, she took law courses at Yale and Northwestern universities.
        From 1936 to 1946, she was assistant chairman of the Republican National Committee in Washington and head of its women's division. In that capacity, she founded what is now the National Federation of Republican Women.
        From 1947 to 1972, in Maine, she was Commissioner of Labor and Industry for the State of Maine.
