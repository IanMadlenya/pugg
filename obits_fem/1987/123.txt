        Anni Frind, who sang leading soubrette soprano roles in both opera and operetta in the 1920's and 30's, died Wednesday in New Orleans. She was 87 years old.
        Ms. Frind was born on Feb. 2, 1900. She made her debut in 1922 at the Berlin Volksoper and later sang at the Munich State Opera, the Dresden State Opera and the German Opera House in Berlin. She had a brilliant success in the world premiere of ''Casanova'' in 1928 and thereafter devoted her energies mainly to operetta. Ms. Frind appeared as Adele in Max Reinhardt's production of ''Die Fledermaus'' 200 times. She made many recordings for HMV and Odeon.
        An early and outspoken opponent of the Nazis, she curtailed her activities in Germany upon the ascent of Hitler. During World War II, she sang for Allied soldiers at the front and worked as a volunteer nurse. After the war, she moved to New Orleans, where she taught singing as Anni Frind-Sperling.
