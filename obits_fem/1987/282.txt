        Lois Hussey Heilbrun, an ornithologist and past president of the Linnaean Society of New York, died of lymphoma last Wednesday at Mount Sinai Hospital. She was 65 years old and lived in Flushing, Queens.
        Mrs. Heilbrun was born in Norwich, Conn., and graduated from Adelphi University. She joined the education department of the American Museum of Natural History in 1945. Starting as a projectionist, she advanced to instructor, senior instructor and assistant department chairman.
        While at the museum she wrote, with Catherine M. Pessino, three books for children, ''Collecting Cocoons,'' ''Collecting Small Fossils'' and ''Collecting for the City Naturalist.'' She retired in 1971 but returned to the museum's ornithology department in 1984 as a volunteer worker.
        From 1972 to 1983, Mrs. Heilbrun edited the Christmas Bird Count issue of the National Audubon Society's American Birds magazine. Interest in Tern Colony
        For more than 35 years, she kept a protective interest in the tern colony on Great Gull Island, an uninhabited speck of land in Long Island Sound, which the Federal Government turned over to the Museum of Natural History in 1949.
        Working with members of the Linnaean Society, she helped re-establish a habitat for the birds on the island and became chairman of the Gull Island Committee.
        She had joined the Linnaean Society in 1950 and served as treasurer and archivist for many years and as president from 1977 to 1979.
        Mrs. Heilburn is survived by her husband, Douglas; a half-sister, Cynthia Benson of Northampton, Mass.; two stepdaughters, Claire Toft of Santa Barbara, Calif., and Erica Duran of Pearblossom, Calif., and three step-grandchildren.
