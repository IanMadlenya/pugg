        A daughter of former New Jersey Gov. William T. Cahill was found dead in her apartment here after drowning in a bathtub, the woman's family and law-enforcement authorities said Friday.
        The victim, Patricia Cahill, 34 years old, who had suffered seizures since being critically injured in a traffic accident in 1969, had failed to show up Wednesday for her job as an I.B.M. sales representative, said her brother, William T. Cahill Jr. Her body was then found by a relative, Mr. Cahill said.
        ''We don't know if there was a seizure or a fall that led to her drowning in the bathroom,'' he said.
        The Camden County Medical Examiner's office, after an autopsy Wednesday, determined the death was caused by accidental drowning.
        Miss Cahill is survived by her father, who was Governor from 1970 to 1974, and mother, Elizabeth, of Haddonfield; two brothers, John and William T. Jr., both of Collingswood; and five sisters, Kathleen Tully of Haddonfield, Mary Cahill of Washington, Regina Keeley of Potomac, Md., Eileen Campbell of Merchantville and Teresa Cahill of Boston.
