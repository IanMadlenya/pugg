        Carole P. Bannett, a housewares retailer and an associate of Lee Bailey, the designer and author, died of cancer Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 59 years old.  A prominent figure in the New York housewares business for many years, Mrs. Bannett also was active in several civic organizations, including the 79th Street Block Association.
        Mrs. Bannett joined Henri Bendel, the department store, in 1973, and became manager of the Lee Bailey shop there. She also became a partner with Mr. Bailey in a wholesale housewares business, Bailey Bannett. In March, she left Henri Bendel to work with Mr. Bailey in opening a new housewares shop at Saks Fifth Avenue.
        She is survived by her husband, J. Charles Bannett, and two daughters, Melissa P., of Berkeley, Calif., and Lorin P., of Manhattan.
