        Maxeda vonHesse, a speech teacher whose clients included Nelson A. Rockefeller and Christian A. Herter, died of lymphoma Sept. 22 at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center. She was 74 years old and lived in Manhattan and Daytona Beach, Fla.
        Miss vonHesse operated the Studios for Effective Speech on East 66th Street. She carried on the work begun by her mother, Elisabeth Ferguson vonHesse, who died in 1963, coaching actors, politicians, business executives and others.
        Miss vonHesse said speech lessons were more than exercises in diction and she worked with a student's ''total personality,'' including gestures, stance, timing, walk and delivery.
        Miss vonHesse taught Mr. Rockefeller and Mr. Herter during their respective campaigns for governor of New York and governor of Massachusetts.
        She was born in Denver and graduated from Rollins College in Winter Park, Fla. She contended she never needed speech lessons because she came from ''a long line of preachers and teachers, who taught us early to appreciate the power of words.''
        There are no immediate survivors.
