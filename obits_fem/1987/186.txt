        Mary E. Harris, an editor, producer and director of radio and television shows for many years, died of a heart attack in her Manhattan apartment on July 19. She was 73 years old.
        Miss Harris, who retired last December after nearly 50 years in broadcasting, had been a story editor for the CBS television anthology, ''Studio One,'' a producer of the daytime serial dramas, ''As the World Turns'' and ''Another World'' and a story consultant for ''All My Children.'' She had also directed ''The $64 Question'' and ''The Art Linkletter Show'' for radio.
        Much of her career in broadcasting was spent as an employee of either Young & Rubicam or McCann-Erickson, both advertising agencies.
        She is survived by her sister, Frances Harris, of Manhattan.
