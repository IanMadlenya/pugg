        Elizabeth (Libba) Cotten, who won a Grammy Award in 1985 for a collection of her blues and folk songs, died today at a Syracuse hospital. She was 95 years old.
        She had been hospitalized for nearly two weeks at Crouse Irving Memorial Hospital and had undergone surgery last weekend after suffering brain seizures.
        Mrs. Cotten, who was born in Chapel Hill, N.C., wrote the classic song ''Freight Train'' when she was 11, but did not begin performing until she was 60 and already a grandmother. In 1978 she moved to Syracuse, where she was named the city's first ''Living Treasure.'' She continued to do live shows until last month.
        Her Grammy Award for top recording in the Ethnic or Traditional Folk Music category was granted for her album ''Elizabeth Cotten Live.''
        Among her more famous songs are ''Shake, Sugaree,'' and ''Oh Babe, It Ain't No Lie.''
