        ''Take my wife . . . please!'' was among several jokes the comedian cracked at his wife's expense.
        ''She took it with a grain of salt,'' Mr. Youngman, 81, said. ''She knew I was just joking. She always stuck by me, and that's what counts.''
        In addition to her husband, Mrs. Youngman is survived by a daughter, Marilyn; a son, Gary, and three grandchildren.
