        Born in Forestville, Conn., Mrs. Weisbord and her husband, Albert, helped lead a citywide strike of textile workers in Passaic, N.J., in 1926. The strike lasted more than a year. Mrs. Weisbord also took part in major textile-industry strikes in New Bedford, Mass., in 1928 and in Gastonia, N.C., in 1929. The strike in North Carolina was accompanied by serious violence, and several unionists, including Mrs. Weisbord, were accused of murder, although charges were later dropped.
        In the early 1930's, Mrs. Weisbord worked as a trade-union organizer of seamen, longshoremen and other maritime workers at New York City docks. She also was editor of The Class Struggle, a radical publication in New York City.
        A Socialist during World War I, she joined the Communist Party in 1919, but she and her husband were expelled from the party in 1929 for criticizing it.
        Her husband died in 1977, the year her autobiography, ''A Radical Life,'' was published by Indiana University Press. There are no survivors.
