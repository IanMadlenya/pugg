        Madge Kennedy, a stage and silent film star in the early part of the century, died of respiratory failure Monday at the Motion Picture and Television Country Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif. She was 96 years old and lived in Hollywood.
        Miss Kennedy was born in Chicago and raised in California. At age 18, she came to New York to study art and joined the Art Students League. A role in an amateur production of a play landed her the female lead in ''The Genius,'' and she stayed an actress.
        Her Broadway debut was in ''Little Miss Brown'' in 1912. After two more stage comedies, ''Twin Beds'' and ''Fair and Warmer,'' she turned to motion pictures in 1916. Among the silent films in which she starred were ''Baby Mine,'' ''Trimmed in Red,'' ''Bad Company,'' ''Lying Wives'' and ''Oh Baby.''
        She left motion pictures in 1926 but continued to act on stage for the next 25 years. She took over from Gertrude Lawrence in Noel Coward's ''Private Lives'' in 1931. She returned to films in 1952 to make her debut in talking pictures in ''The Marrying Kind,'' starring Judy Holliday.
        Some of Miss Kennedy's later films were ''Day of the Locust,'' ''North by Northwest'' and ''They Shoot Horses, Don't They?'' Her last movie was ''Marathon Man'' in 1976.
        On television, she played in such series as ''Leave It to Beaver,'' ''The Twilight Zone'' and ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents.''
        She has no immediate survivors.
