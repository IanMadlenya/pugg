        Mrs. Johns, a native of Ohio, came to New York just before World War II and established what became S. Irene Johns Inc., which she operated until its merger into Kirby Block Inc. about 10 years ago. She also served on volunteer committees to promote the city's fashion industry and on the State Attorney General's consumer-fraud commission.
        Over the years, Mrs. Johns headed many charitable, civic and professional organizations, and she was president of the American Women Buyers Club for 12 years.
        Mrs. Johns is survived by a son, Robert, of Manhattan.
