        Lillian Bostwick Phipps, who was active in horse racing and the performing arts in New York for several decades after World War II, died yesterday at her home in Summerville, S.C. She was 81 years old.
        Her marriage in 1937 to Ogden Phipps united two of the most socially prominent polo-playing and turf-racing families in New York. Mrs. Phipps fielded many champion steeplechase racers, the most famous of which was Neji, a jumper who earned more than $270,000 between 1952 and 1960.
        Mrs. Phipps was a former chairman of the Saratoga Performing Arts Center and a member of its board at the time of her death. She was also a former member of the boards of the Visiting Nurse Service of New York and of the Metropolitan Opera Association.
        Besides her husband, she is survived by a son, Ogden Mills Phipps of Westbury, L.I.; three daughters, Cynthia Phipps of Westbury, Lillian Rousseau of Palm Beach, Fla., and Florence Chase of Manhattan; a brother, Dunbar Bostwick of Sherburne, Vt., and a sister, Dorothy Campbell of Cooperstown, N.Y.
