        Maria Swoboda, a noted ballet teacher, died last Thursday at Lakewood (N.J.) Hospital, after a stroke in July. Miss Swoboda, who habitually refused to disclose her age, was believed to be 86.
        She taught at some of the leading ballet studios in New York, among them the schools of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, American Ballet Theater, the June Taylor School and the Igor Youskevitch studio. Her pupils included Gertrude Tyven, Norma Vance, Meredith Baylis, Perry Brunson, Roni Mahler and Andrea Vodehnal.
        Born Maria Yurieva in St. Petersburg, Miss Swoboda studied dance with Lydia Nelidova in Moscow and entered the Bolshoi Ballet at 15. She was the first dancer taken into the Bolshoi company who trained with private teachers. She left Russia in 1917 and toured Europe with a dance company organized by her and her husband, Vecheslav Swoboda, formerly a soloist with the Bolshoi Ballet and now dead.
        The two came to the United States as lead dancers with the Chicago Civic Opera Ballet and toured the country several times. The Swobodas opened their own studio in New York in 1937. Miss Swoboda kept the school open after her husband died until 1954, when it became the company school of the Ballet Russe. Miss Swoboda was also married to Nicholas Nedbal.
        Miss Swoboda lived in Lakewood, N.J. She taught at her own ballet schools in Asbury Park and Spring Lake and had conducted classes as a guest teacher at ballet companies around the country. She was retired at the time of her death. There are no survivors.
