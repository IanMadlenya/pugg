        Born in Buffalo, she helped found Westons Shopper City in Olean, N.Y., a self-service department store that grew into a chain of 15 stores in New York, Pennsylvania and Maryland. The company was sold to K Mart and the Jamesway Corporation.
        She is survived by a son, Howard, of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
