        In 1980, Mrs. Hawes became the fourth American woman to attain the rank of grand master, the highest rank of the World Bridge Federation. Since then, four other American women have reached that rank.
        In a playing career lasting more than 30 years, she won four world titles and 11 national titles. She represented the United States on four other occasions.
        In Venice in 1974, Mrs. Hawes was a member of the winning American team at the first world championship for women's teams based on continental zones, winning the Venice Trophy. She helped defend the trophy successfully in 1976 in Monte Carlo and in 1978 in New Orleans.
        In 1980, in Valkenburg, the Netherlands, she and her regular teammates - Dorothy Hayden Truscott, Jacqui Mitchell, Gail Greenberg, Mary Jane Farell and Marilyn Johnson - became the first Americans to win the Olympiad team title in either the open or women's divisions.
        Mrs. Hawes retired from competition in 1981.
        She was born in Benton, Ky., and graduated from Cornell University at the age of 18.
        She is survived by her husband, David Hawes, a daughter, Evalie Horner, and a granddaughter.
