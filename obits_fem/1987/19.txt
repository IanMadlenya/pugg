        Margaret Laurence, a novelist whom The Toronto Star in 1974 called ''one of the titans of Canadian literature,'' died of cancer yesterday in Lakefield, Ontario, where she had lived for the last 25 years. She was 60 years old.
        Mrs. Laurence's 1966 novel ''A Jest of God,'' was adapted to the screen in 1968 as ''Rachel, Rachel.'' Joanne Woodward played the title role and Paul Newman directed the film.
        Mrs. Laurence came to public attention in 1954 with ''A Tree for Poverty,'' an English translation of poetry and stories from Somaliland. The autobiographical novel ''New Wind in a Dry Land'' and a volume of stories, ''The Tomorrow-Tamer,'' both published in 1964, also drew on the years she spent in West Africa with her husband, Jack, a civil engineer.
        Much of her fiction was set in a town called Manawaka, patterned on the Manitoba town where she grew up. Her compatriot, the novelist Robertson Davies, wrote in The New York Times in 1964 that Mrs. Laurence told her stories ''in a good, firm vocabulary,'' whose ''rhythms are those of Canada before the turn of this century.''
        Among the titles in her comparitively small output are ''The Stone Angel'' (1964), ''A Bird in the House'' (1970) and ''The Diviners'' (1974).
