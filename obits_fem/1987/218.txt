        Mary Dobkin, whose work kept thousands of children out of trouble and inspired a television movie about her life, died Saturday. She was 84 years old.
        Ms. Dobkin held annual Christmas parties where she dispensed toys and affection to needy children. For more than 30 years she coached a youth baseball league.
        She was a native of Russia who arrived in America without her family and at the age of 6 was found nearly dead on the street from frostbite and exposure because she was too poor to own shoes.
        She became nationally known after her life was made into a television movie in 1979 called ''Aunt Mary.'' Jean Stapleton portrayed her in the movie.
