        Dr. Georgia B. Christopher, a professor of English at Emory University, died on Dec. 16 in DeKalb Medical Center in Decatur, Ga. She was 62 and lived in Decatur.
        The cause was cancer, her family said.
        She was the author of "Milton and the Science of the Saints" (Princeton University Press, 1983), for which she received the James Holly Hanford Award of the Milton Society of America. She also contributed frequently to journals of language and philology.
        Born in Barnesville, Ga., she graduated from Agnes Scott College and earned her Ph.D. in English from Yale University. She taught at the University of North Carolina and the University of Richmond before joining the Emory faculty in 1981.
        Dr. Christopher is survived by two brothers, John Christopher of Roswell, Ga., and Kent Christopher of Blairsville, Ga.
