        Mildred Barry Hughes, who in 1965 was the first woman elected a state senator in New Jersey, died on Jan. 11 at the Cranford (N.J.) Health and Extended Care Center. She was 92 and had lived for many years in Union, N.J.
        The cause was a heart attack, said a son, Peter L. Hughes 3d of Annandale, N.J.
        First elected to the New Jersey Assembly in 1957, she represented Union Township for four terms before running for the Senate in 1965. In that victory, she also was the first Democrat from Union County to be elected to the State Senate in 75 years.
        After writing a handbook for the Elizabeth League of Women Voters, she was persuaded to run for the Assembly. Defeated in her first attempt in 1955, she won in 1957 and rose to become assistant majority leader in 1960 and 1961. She served one term in the Senate.
        Her husband, Peter L. Hughes Jr., died in 1971. Besides her son Peter 3d, she is survived by two other sons, W. Barry of Greenwood, S.C., and David J. of Short Hills, N.J.
