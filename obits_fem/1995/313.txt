        Marion Lounsbury Foster, who was for many years a social services administrator with the Disaster Staff of the American Red Cross, specializing in public and private emergencies, died on Thursday at St. Vincent's Medical Center in Bridgeport, Conn.
        She was 97 and a longtime resident of New York City.
        Beginning in 1917, Mrs. Foster was for 40 years the director of the Home Service Department of the Red Cross's Brooklyn chapter, finding help in times of need for the families of men and women in the armed forces and aid for people in distress after floods, storms, train wrecks and much smaller crises.
        In 1931, her office provided Easter dresses to wives of disabled World War I veterans. And in 1938, she directed case workers in aiding victims of a disastrous hurricane that struck Long Island, providing services and financial relief to thousands of families.
        Mrs. Foster, who retired in 1957, was also a founder and treasurer of the Brooklyn Association for Mental Health.
        She was born in New York City and graduated from the Brearley School, Columbia University and the New York School of Social Work.
        Her husband, William Jenkins Foster, died in 1958. There are no immediate survivors.
