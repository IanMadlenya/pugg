        Erika Lehnsen, one of the first art therapists to work with children, died on Sunday at the Andrus retirement home in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. Until recently, Miss Lehnsen, who was 90, was a resident of the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
        Miss Lehnsen and her associates, including Elinor Ulman and Bernard Levy, were among the founders of the art therapy field.
        Born in a small town near Berlin, she studied at an innovative school where practicing artists taught free and applied art. After Nazi persecution prompted her departure from Germany, she joined her brother in Guatemala, where he had founded a boarding school. There, she taught art and art appreciation and discovered her interest in the artwork of young children.
        She moved to the United States in 1954 and received a master's degree in psychology at the New School for Social Research. She worked for 14 years at Montefiore Medical Center before retiring 20 years ago.
