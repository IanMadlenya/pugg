        Katharine B. Day, the widow of Clarence Day, author of "Life With Father" and other books, died on Aug. 25 at her home in Manhattan. She was 94.
        After her husband's death in 1935, Mrs. Day acted as the technical adviser for the Broadway production of "Life With Father" in 1939 and contributed heavily to its sequel, "Life With Mother," in 1948. Both plays were created by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse, working from Day's reminiscences of his youth in New York City in the 1880's. Mrs. Day also served as an adviser for the 1947 film adaptation of "Life With Father."
        She is survived by a daughter, Wilhelmine; three grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
