        Libby E. Sachar, who in 1946 was the first woman appointed a Superior Court judge in New Jersey, died on Dec. 28 at her home in Plainfield, N.J. She was 90.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, said her son, Judge Leonard Sachar of Scotch Plains, N.J.
        Selected as a juvenile-domestic relations judge by Gov. Walter Edge and reappointed in 1951, she served in Union County for 10 years until she resumed her private law practice in Plainfield.
        She was a 1924 graduate of the New York University School of Law and was an advocate of women's rights. In 1947, she was a member of the New Jersey Constitution Committee, which revised the state's Constitution.
        In addition to her son, who is on the Superior Court bench in Union County, she is survived by a daughter, Naomi Margolies of Plainfield; a brother, Dr. Morton Bertin of Orlando, Fla., six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.
