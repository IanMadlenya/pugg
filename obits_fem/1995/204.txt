        Gretchen Geber, a cello instructor whose students have gone on to play in major American orchestras, died on Saturday at her home in Woodland Hills, Calif. She was 81.
        Mrs. Geber studied briefly at the University of Southern California and later taught there while pursuing studio work and performing.
        Among her students are current members of symphonies in Los Angeles and New  Orleans, said her husband, Edwin, a retired cellist with the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
        In addition to her husband, Mrs. Geber is survived by two sons, Stephen, the  principal cellist with the Cleveland Orchestra, and David, a cellist with the American String Quartet and chairman of the Manhattan School of Music's string department, and six grandchildren.
