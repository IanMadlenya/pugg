        Tania Kurella Stern, a physical therapist and a co-translator, with her husband, of the work of many noted German writers, died on Monday at her home in Wiltshire, England. She was 91.
        Mrs. Stern was born in Berlin, where her father was a prominent psychiatrist. She and the writer James Stern were married in Paris in 1935. They fled the Nazis in 1939 and settled in New York, where Mrs. Stern worked as a physical therapist. The poet W. H. Auden, a client who became a close friend, described a Christmas spent with the Sterns in the poem "Thank You, Fog."
        Mr. and Mrs. Stern, who moved to England in 1955, collaborated on the English translations of works by Thomas Mann, Franz Kafka, Erich Maria Remarque and Hugo von Hofmannsthal, among others. They also translated the letters of Kafka and Sigmund Freud.
        Mr. Stern died in 1993. No immediate family members survive.
