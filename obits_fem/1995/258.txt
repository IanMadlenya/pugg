        Uta Graf, a German-born soprano and teacher, died on Friday at the Nathaniel Witherill nursing home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 80 and had lived mainly in New York City after coming to the United States in 1948.
        She had a long illness, said her daughter, Angele A. Elliott-Smith.
        Miss Graf gave recitals at Town Hall in Manhattan in 1949, 1952, 1964 and 1967. After her 1949 appearance, a reviewer wrote, "Being a woman of taste, imagination and musical culture, she won the cordial applause of her audience."
        In the first years after her arrival in the United States she also sang with the San Francisco Opera, the New York Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall and the Royal Opera in London. Later she sang in operas, recitals and concerts in the United States, Canada, Europe and South America.
        She taught voice at Vassar College in 1949 and later taught at the new England Conservatory of Music in Boston, Manhattan School of Music, Queens College and elsewhere. She also did much private teaching until 1990 and made a score of recordings.
        Miss Graf was born in Karlsruhe, Germany, and studied at the Dr. Hoch Conservatory of Music in Frankfurt. She sang in operas and at concerts in Europe early in her career.
        Her 1943 marriage to Pierre Bryer, a Belgian violinist, ended in divorce. In addition to her daughter, of Greenwich, Conn., she is survived by a sister, Inge Stegmuller of Princeton, N.J..
