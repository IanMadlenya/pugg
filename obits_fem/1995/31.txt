        Anne Tabachnick, a figurative artist whose painterly style was inspired by Matisse, died on Tuesday at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 67.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, said her daughter, Felicity Turner.
        Ms. Tabachnick was born in New York City in 1927 and studied painting under Hans Hoffman. She earned a B.A. in anthropology and art at Hunter College and also studied art at the University of California, Berkeley, and New York University. Like many artists of her generation, including Larry Rivers, Nell Blaine and her close friend, Robert De Niro Sr., Ms. Tabachnick was familiar with the gestural techniques of Abstract Expressionism, but, looking to Matisse, preferred to used them in portraits, landscapes and figure paintings.
        Her first New York show was in 1951 at the Circle in the Square Gallery, and she was later represented by the Ingber Gallery. Her most recent exhibition was at the Erica Meyerovich Gallery in San Francisco in April.
        Ms. Tabachnick is represented in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art and the University Art Museum, Berkeley.
        Her marriage to John Newbro ended in divorce. In addition to her daughter, of Cambridge, Mass., she is survived by her mother, Freda Tabachnick of Manhattan; a son, David Newbro, also of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.
        Correction:  June 26, 1995, Monday
        An obituary on Friday about the artist Anne Tabachnick misidentified the San Francisco gallery that held her last exhibition, in April. It was the Eleanor Austerer Gallery, not the Erica Meyerovich.
