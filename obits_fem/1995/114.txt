        Selma Burke, a sculptor of the Harlem Renaissance in the 1920's and 30's, died on Tuesday in New Hope, Pa. She was 94.
        Ms. Burke came to national attention in 1945 with a 2 1/2-by-3 1/2-foot bronze plaque commemorating President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Four Freedoms. She won the commission for it in a nationwide competition, and President Harry S. Truman spoke at the unveiling in September 1945 at the Recorder of Deeds Building in Washington.
        Her other work included likenesses of Booker T. Washington, the abolitionist John Brown and President Calvin Coolidge. She taught art in Pittsburgh for 17 years and operated her Selma Burke Art Center there from 1972 to 1981.
