        Mercedes Rossy, a pianist, composer and bandleader, died on Thursday in Barcelona, Spain. She was 34.
        The cause was intestinal cancer, said her brother Jorge.
        Ms. Rossy, who studied classical piano from the age of 6, began playing jazz seriously in the early 1980's. In 1985 she moved to Munich, Germany, where she performed regularly. Four years later she won a scholarship to the Berklee School of Music in Boston, where she remained until her graduation in 1992.
        It was at Berklee that she met many of the musicians with whom she later performed, some of the better players of her generation. Her band, with which she toured Europe, included the saxophonists Mark Turner and Steve Wilson. She also played with the saxophonists Herb Harris, Seamus Blake and Antonio Hart, the trombonist Hal Crook and the drummer Leon Parker.
        Ms. Rossy performed frequently around New York and was to play at Small's in  January. In addition to her brother Jorge, a drummer, of New York, she is survived by her parents, Mario and Josefina, and another brother, Mario, a bassist, all of Barcelona.
