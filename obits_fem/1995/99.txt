        Rose Chernin, a prominent figure in left-wing politics in the 1940's and 1950's whose arrest for Communist activities led to a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court, died on Sept. 8 at her home in Los Angeles. She was 93.
        Born in Russia, Ms. Chernin came to the United States in 1913 and became a citizen in 1929. She was executive secretary of the American Committee for the Protection of the Foreign Born.
        In 1951, along with 11 other members of left-wing groups, including the Communist Party, she was arrested by the Federal authorities -- and later convicted -- on charges of violating the Smith Act of 1940. That law made advocating Marxism or Leninism tantamount to conspiracy to overthrow the Government.
        The Immigration and Naturalization Service tried to have Ms. Chernin deported. But in 1957, the Supreme Court ruled that the Smith Act was unconstitutional, stating that convictions under the law must require proof of "forcible action" to overthrow the Government rather than mere advocacy of revolutionary politics.
        Ms. Chernin is survived by her daughter, Kim, of Berkeley, Calif., and a sister, Lillian Doran of Camarillo, Calif.
