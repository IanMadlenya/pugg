        Ruth Wilmanns Lidz, a clinical professor of psychiatry at the Yale University School of Medicine, died on Monday at Yale-New Haven Hospital. She was 85 and lived in Woodbridge, Conn.
        A clinical professor since 1965, she had continued to work in the department, pursuing her interest in the psychotherapy of schizophrenia. She also remained an active member of the Western New England Psychoanalytic Society and the American Psychoanalytic Society.
        She was born in Heidelberg, Germany, the daughter of Karl Wilmanns, a professor and director of Heidelberg University's psychiatry department. She left Germany shortly after the Hitler regime came to power and completed her medical education in Switzerland.
        During World War II, she was on the faculty of Johns Hopkins University before entering psychoanalytical practice in Baltimore and New Haven. At Yale, she became known for her work with schizophrenic and other seriously disturbed patients and for dealing with the emotional factors in adolescent pregnancies.
        Dr. Lidz is survived by her husband of 56 years, Theodore Lidz, a Yale professor emeritus of psychiatry, and three sons, Victor, of Villanova, Pa., Charles, of Pittsburgh, and Jerome, of Eugene, Ore.
