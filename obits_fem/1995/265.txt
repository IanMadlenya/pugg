        Kalpana Joshi, a Bengali who was prominent in India's struggle for independence from British rule, died on Feb. 8 in Calcutta. She was 81.
        Mrs. Joshi, whose maiden name was Dutt, was born in the town of Sripur in what was then the Bengal region of India. Sripur is now in Bangladesh, 50 miles north of the capital, Dhaka.
        She became a political advocate as a college student in Calcutta, returned to her native area and worked with Surya Ben, a pro-independence militant who became an anti-British rebel leader and eventually was hanged in 1933.
        Mrs. Joshi went underground and, Dipankar De Sarkar wrote on Wednesday in the British newspaper The Guardian, she "helped make bombs, acted as a courier of messages and arms and ammunition and participated in numerous hit-and-run attacks on British targets."
        Later she was taken prisoner and given a life sentence, which touched off public protests. Mahatma Gandhi, the independence leader, who was a champion of nonviolence, visited her in prison, and she was set free early, in 1939.
        Mrs. Joshi went on to become a Communist, and in 1943 she married Puran Chand Joshi, who was a Communist leader at the time.
