        Isabel Leighton Bunker, whose long career as an actress and writer embraced theater, journalism and television, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 95.
        The cause was a stroke, said Evan H. Rhodes, her son-in-law.
        Miss Leighton began her career in the theater, appearing in several Broadway productions in the early 1920's. She went on to collaborate on six plays that were produced on Broadway, including "Mercenary Mary" (1925) and "Spring Again" (1941). The latter, which she wrote with Bertram Bloch, starred Grace George, C. Aubrey Smith and Joseph Buloff.
        In the 1930's and 40's she wrote for various magazines and for the North American Newspaper Alliance, and served as a naval correspondent in World War II. She was the author or co-author of several books, including "My Boy Franklin," about Franklin D. Roosevelt, written with Gabrielle Forbush, and "Where Away," written with George Sessions Perry, the story of the World War II cruiser Marblehead.
        She was the editor of "The Aspirin Age, 1919-41," a best-selling collection of articles -- by John Lardner, Howard Fast and others -- about life in the United States between the World Wars.
        In the early 1950's she was moderator of a popular television program called "How Did They get That Way?," which dealt with psychiatry and mental health. She also served on the boards of several civic and philanthropic organizations, including the World Federation for Mental Health and the Menninger Foundation.
        Miss Leighton's husband, Arthur H. Bunker, died in 1963. No immediate family members survive.
