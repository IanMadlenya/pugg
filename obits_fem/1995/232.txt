        Kay Aldridge Tucker, an actress and model who was one of the most photographed women in the country in the 1930's, died on Jan. 12 at Penobscot Bay Medical Center in Rockport, Me. She was 77 and lived in Camden, Me.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Lester Glassner, a friend.
        Ms. Tucker, whose stage name was Kay Aldridge, appeared on the covers of Life, Ladies' Home Journal, Redbook and Look magazines and in many advertisements. Her Hollywood career began when she was given a screen test for the role of Scarlett O'Hara in "Gone With the Wind." The test led to her appearance in feature films and three highly successful serials, "Perils of Nyoka," "Daredevils of the West" and "Haunted Harbor." Her feature film credits include "Free, Blonde and 21," "Down Argentine Way," "You're in the Army Now" and "DuBarry Was a Lady." She retired from acting in 1945.
        Ms. Tucker's third husband, Harry Nasland, died in 1988.
        She is survived by a daughter, Carey Cameron Ferrero; two sons, Scott and Arthur Cameron; a stepdaughter, Minnie Tucker Biggs, and two stepsons, Richard and Samuel Tucker.
