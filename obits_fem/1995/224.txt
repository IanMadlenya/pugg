        Cleo Rickman Fitch, an archeological researcher who specialized in Roman lamps, died on Sunday in her home in Manhattan. She was 84.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, her family said.
        In 1962, she joined an excavation of the ancient town of Cosa, north of Rome, and continued her work into the 1980's.
        The book "Cosa: The Lamps," which she wrote with Dr. Norma Goldman of Wayne State University, was issued last fall as part of the American Academy series through the University of Michigan Press.
        She was born in Carlsbad, Tex., and received a bachelor's degree from Peabody College in Nashville.
        She is survived by her husband, Dr. James Marston Fitch, the architectural historian and critic, and a brother, John Rickman of Chapel Hill, Tenn.
