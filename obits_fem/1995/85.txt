        Phyllis Brooks, a popular film and stage actress in the 1930's and 40's, died on Tuesday at her home in Cape Neddick, Me. She was 80.
        Miss Brooks, a native of Boise, Idaho, started her career as an artist's model in New York, posing for the magazine illustrator James Montgomery Flagg and others. Hollywood discovered her in 1934 as the "Ipana toothpaste girl," and she appeared in Sidney Toler's Charlie Chan series and the Shirley Temple films "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm" and "Little Miss Broadway." Unhappy with her roles, she tried her luck on Broadway, and succeeded with the George S. Kaufman-Edna Ferber play "Stage Door" (1936) and the hit Ethel Merman musical "Panama Hattie" (1940).
        Miss Brooks, who was engaged at one time to Cary Grant, married Torbert H. Macdonald, a wealthy former college football star and hero of World War II, in 1945. He and John F. Kennedy had been college roommates at Harvard.
        The Macdonalds settled in Malden, Mass., where Mr. Macdonald was elected to Congress in 1954. He served 11 straight terms, until his death in 1976.
        Miss Brooks was active in promoting her husband's political career and that of Kennedy, who was their elder son's godfather. While she declined to move to Washington, she was a frequent hostess on the social scene, especially after Kennedy became President.
        She is survived by two sons, Torbert Jr., of York, Me., and Brian, of Salem, Mass.; two daughters, Laurie, of Everett, Mass., and Robin, of Kennebunk, Me.; a brother, Norman Brooks of Cushing, Me., and eight grandchildren.
