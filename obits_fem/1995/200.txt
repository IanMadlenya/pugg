        Lillian Teit Zabar, who fled the pogroms of her homeland, came to the United  States and became part of an American success story, died Friday in Manhattan. She was 90, or perhaps 92 or 93.
        Mrs. Zabar was a founder with her husband, Louis, of Zabar's gourmet delicatessen and food emporium on Broadway at 80th Street in Manhattan. The business was started in 1934 and now has about 35,000 customers a week and $40 million in sales a year, her sons Stanley and Saul said.
        Mrs. Zabar marked her 90th birthday on the day she died, but her sons said she was almost certainly two or three years older. When she came to the United States from Ukraine in the mid-1920's, she shaved some years off her age in fear that the immigration authorities would send her back as too old, her sons said.
        Nor was it known with certainty that Dec. 22 was her date of birth. But she knew she was born during Hanukkah, so her birthday was celebrated during the holiday every year, her sons explained.
        She came to America and settled first with relatives in Philadelphia. Later,  she moved to New York City, where she met Louis Zabar, an old acquaintance from  their Ukrainian village. They soon married.
        Mr. Zabar headed the smoked-fish section of a food store, and Mrs. Zabar was  an accomplished cook. They started their modest deli in Brooklyn and moved it to Manhattan a half-century ago.
        Saul and Stanley Zabar, who live in Manhattan and are still associated with the family business said last night that their mother was a gifted maker of blintzes, potato salad, stuffed cabbage and coleslaw.
        Louis Zabar died in 1950. Mrs. Zabar's second husband, Louis Chartoff, died about 15 years ago. Surviving are another son, Eli, a Manhattan restaurateur; eight grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.
