        Sabina Lietzmann, a former American correspondent for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Germany's most influential daily newspaper, died on Monday at her home in West Cornwall, Conn. She was 75.
        A friend, Ingeborg von Zitzewitz, said she died of cancer.
        Miss Lietzmann joined the Frankfurt newspaper in 1949, and was its correspondent in New York from 1961 until her retirement in 1984.
        Her attitude toward New York was reflected in the title she chose for a book on the city: "New York: The Wonderful Catastrophe." It was published in Germany in 1976.
        She is survived by a sister, Regina Korn of Kronberg, Germany.
