        Helen Phillips Hayter, an American sculptor, died on Jan. 23 at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 81 and also had a home in Paris.
        Mrs. Hayter was born in Fresno, Calif., in 1913. After studies at the California School of Fine Arts in San Francisco, she went to Paris on a scholarship in 1936. There she studied engraving at Atelier 17, the printmaking workshop of the painter and engraver Stanley William Hayter. They were married in 1940.
        In her sculpture, Mrs. Hayter worked mostly in polished bronze, developing an idiom of semi-abstract figuration influenced by Brancusi, the Surrealists and Pre-Columbian statuary.
        During World War II the Hayters lived in New York, where Mr. Hayter published prints by Abstract Expressionists. Mrs. Hayter had her first solo show in 1942 at the New School for Social Research and the first of several joint exhibitions with her husband at the Sidney Janis Gallery in 1949. The Hayters returned to Paris in 1950; they were divorced in 1970.
        Mrs. Hayter is represented in several collections, among them the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.
        She is survived by two sons, Augy, of Manhattan, and Julian, of Paris; a sister, Marian Britton of Sonoma, Calif., and two grandsons.
