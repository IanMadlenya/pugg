        Carmen Sylva Mathews, an actress, environmentalist and philanthropist who established a summer camp for disadvantaged children, died on Thursday at her farm in Redding, Conn. She was 84 years old.
        Ms. Mathews was born in Philadelphia and trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. She made her first professional acting appearance with the Stratford-on-Avon Shakespearean Company before moving back to the United States.
        Her acting career spanned 55 years, including the roles of Ophelia in "Hamlet" and the queen in "Richard II." She played a range of characters in several Broadway shows, sharing the stage with notables like Don Ameche, Angela Lansbury and Joanne Woodward.
        She appeared in countless television plays and movies and is still seen in reruns as Col. Lillian Rayborn in a popular episode of "M.A.S.H." Her last role was in "The Best Years of My Life," a 1990 television movie with Mary Tyler Moore and Bernadette Peters.
        Her film credits also include "Butterfield 8," "Rage to Live," "Sounder" and "Daniel."
        A passionate environmentalist, Ms. Mathews recently made a perpetual donation of her 100-acre New Pond Farm to the Redding Land Trust to insure that it would retain its woods, fields, pond and marsh.
        Also in 1983, she established a summer camp for disadvantaged city children, known as the New Pond Farm Education Center. Because of her philanthropic endeavors, the United Nations named her one of Connecticut's outstanding women in 1987.
