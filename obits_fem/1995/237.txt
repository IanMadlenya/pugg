        Anne D. Campbell, an official of the Democratic National Committee in Washington, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 50 and had homes in Washington and Manhattan.
        The cause was heart failure, according to Steve Selby, a Washington business associate.
        Mrs. Campbell, a longtime resident of Shrewsbury, N.J., rose to prominence in the state party in the 1970's. She was serving her fourth term on the National Committee's executive committee in Washington. She joined that panel more than 10 years ago and was the co-chairwoman of the party's rules and bylaws committee for the last several years.
        Born in Brownsville, Tex., she grew up in New York City, attended Monmouth College and entered national politics in 1972. She was a past vice chairman of the New Jersey Democratic State Committee and in 1977 became the first woman to be elected president of the National Association of State Chairmen. She also held senior posts on the staff of Gov.  Brendan T. Byrne of New Jersey and was an adviser to Senator Bill Bradley in his successful campaigns.
        She was the political director at the Democratic National Convention in 1988, as well as director of candidate and Congressional relations at the 1992 national convention.
        Mrs. Campbell was a partner in the legislative consulting firm of Campbell, Falk & Selby in Washington, which she founded in 1988.
        She is survived by her husband of 30 years, George Campbell; a daughter, Heather, of Santa Fe, N.M.; and two sons, James, also of Santa Fe, and Nial, of Manhattan.
