        Leila Mourad, an Egyptian singer and actress who rose to fame in the 1940's and 50's, died on Tuesday, Egyptian newspapers reported today. She was 77.
        They said the Jewish-born actress -- who withdrew from the limelight after a  career spanning 39 years -- died of heart failure.
        Ms. Mourad's vibrant voice and glamorous on-screen roles dazzled Middle Eastern audiences during the heyday of Egyptian cinema. She retired in 1969 after performing in more than 28 films and recording about 1,000 songs.
        The actress, who converted to Islam in the 1940's, is survived by a son, Zaky Fateen Abdel Wahab.
