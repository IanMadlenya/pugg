        Phyllis Hyman, a New York jazz singer whose most recent hits included "When You Get Right Down to It" and "Living in Confusion," died yesterday afternoon in Manhattan, a possible suicide, the police said. She was 45.
        An assistant to Ms. Hyman found the singer unconscious in her bedroom at 211 West 56th Street around 2 P.M., said Detective Dwight Cunningham, a police spokesman. She died at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center at 3:50 P.M., hours before she was scheduled to perform at the Apollo Theater in Harlem.
        The police found pills and a note, the detective said. The police did not disclose the contents of the note.
        Ms. Hyman, a legal secretary who sang jazz and rhythm and blues and recently performed rap, had a starring role in "Sophisticated Ladies," a Broadway musical that paid tribute to Duke Ellington.
