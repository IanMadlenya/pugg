        Mary Doyle, an actress in theater, films and television, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 63.
        The cause was lung cancer, said her daughter, Ruth A. McQuiggan Rosenbloom.
        Ms. Doyle was born in Lincoln, Neb., and came to New York City to study acting in 1951. She was a graduate of the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theater, where she studied with Sanford Meisner.
        Her stage credits include the Circle in the Square productions of "The House of Breath" (1957) and "Plays for Bleecker Street" (1962), Arnold Wesker's "Roots" (1961) and "Henry V" (1969) at the American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Conn.
        Ms. Doyle appeared on television in "Law and Order," among many other shows.
        In addition to her daughter, of Manhattan, she is survived by two brothers, David F. Doyle of Los Angeles and John R. Doyle of Lincoln.
