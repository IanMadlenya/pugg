        Margaret Avery Rowell, a cellist who was one of the country's best-known teachers of the instrument, died on April 21 at Kaiser Medical Center in Oakland, Calif. She was 94 and lived in Berkeley, Calif.
        The cause was pneumonia, said her daughter-in-law, Barbara Rowell.
        Mrs. Rowell taught for 14 years at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, and was on the faculties of the University of California at Berkeley, Stanford University, Mills College and San Francisco State University.
        Among her former students are Paul Tobias, a faculty member of the Mannes College of Music and the Manhattan School of Music, and Bonnie Hampton, the president of Chamber Music America and a member of the San Francisco Trio.
        Her husband, Edward Z. Rowell, a speech and philosophy professor at the University of California, died in 1975. She is survived by a son, Galen, of Berkeley, two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
