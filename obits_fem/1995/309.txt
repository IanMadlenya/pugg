        Litia Namoura, a dancer and teacher, died on April 11 at her home in Brooklyn. She was 83.
        The cause was heart disease, said Edward Coury, a cousin.
        Early in her career, in the 1930's, Miss Namoura was a protegee and understudy of the modern-dance pioneer Ruth St. Denis. She performed Hindu and Eastern dances with Ragini Devi and La Meri in the 1940's, a time when she also began to teach dance. Miss Namoura also studied and worked with May O'Donnell, Martha Graham, Angel Cansino and Jose Fernandez.
        She toured North Africa with the U.S.O. during World War II and also performed in India and the Middle East.
        Miss Namoura's husband, Habib Katibah, died in 1958.
        No immediate family members survive.
