        Eleanore Griffin, a Hollywood writer who shared an Academy Award for a story that became part of a political debate more than half a century later, died on Wednesday at the Motion Picture and Television Fund Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif. She was 91.
        In a career that extended from the 1930's to the 60's, Miss Griffin wrote or helped write such movies as "St. Louis Blues," "Good Morning, Miss Dove" and "Imitation of Life," but by far her most significant work was "Boys Town," the 1938 movie in which Father Flanagan, a compassionate Roman Catholic priest (Spencer Tracy) runs a school for a group of endearing juvenile delinquents led by Mickey Rooney.
        Miss Griffin and Dore Schary shared an Oscar for best original story.
        It was a story whose uplifting message reverberated through the political atmosphere last year when Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, cited the movie as evidence that private philanthropic efforts could make up for cuts in Government spending on social benefits.
        Miss Griffin, who was born in St. Paul, Minn., worked for a number of studios over the years, developing what amounted to an ecumenical specialty in movies based on religious personalities. In addition to "Boys Town," these included "A Man Called Peter," (1955) about the Presbyterian minister Peter Marshall, and "One Man's Way," a 1964 biography of the Rev. Norman Vincent Peale.
