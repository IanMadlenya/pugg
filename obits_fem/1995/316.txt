        Marion Burbank Stevens Rice, a noted teacher and producer of dance by the pioneering modern dancers Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn, died on April 12 at the Highlands Long Term Care Center in Fitchburg, Mass.. She was 90 and lived in Ashby, Mass.
        Mrs. Rice was known for the purity and vitality of her dancers and her dance restagings. She learned the Denishawn technique and most of the dances in the late 1920's and early 30's at the Braggiotti-Denishawn School of Dance in Boston, where she studied with Shawn and others. From 1929 through 1988, she was director of the Marion Rice Studio of the Dance in Fitchburg, Mass., and she continued to teach in the area after closing her school.
        Mrs. Rice founded her own company, Marion Rice Denishawn Dancers, in the 1940's. The group gained widespread attention and critical praise in 1972 when it performed at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass. The company received even greater critical praise five years later when it performed in its New York City debut, featuring the 72-year-old Mrs. Rice in a St. Denis solo.
        In 1980, Mrs. Rice was invited to stage her version of "Soaring," a 1920 dance created by St. Denis and Doris Humphry, for Les Grands Ballets Canadiens in Montreal. The next year, the troupe participated in "The Early Years: American Modern Dance from 1900 through the 1930's," a festival organized by the State University of New York at Purchase. Mrs. Rice continued to teach until recently.
        Mrs. Rice's husband, J. Parker Rice, died in 1965. She is survived by a daughter, Carolyn Brown of Millbrook, N.Y., a former lead dancer with the Merce Cunningham Dance Company; a son, J. Parker Rice Jr. of Ashburnham, Mass.; a sister, Elinor Stevens Cloutier of Ashburnham; three grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
