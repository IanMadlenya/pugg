        Marcia Cayne, president of the Association of Reform Zionists of America and a member of the Conference of Major American Jewish Organizations, died on Saturday at Tarzana Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 57 and lived in Los Angeles.
        The cause was cancer, the association said.
        Born Marcia Liebert in Brooklyn, Ms. Cayne moved to Southern California in 1970 and became active in the Zionist association on the local level in 1981, shortly after it was formed. She was elected president of the organization's Pacific-Southwest Region in 1987 and president of the association in 1993.
        The association has chapters in more than 600 Reform synagogues and promotes Reform activities in Israel. It seeks equality for all Jewish denominations in Israel, where religious life has traditionally been dominated by strict Orthodox Judaism.
        Ms. Cayne was associated with many Jewish causes. She was a trustee and member of the executive committee of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations and was active in groups like the World Zionist Organization and the American Zionist Movement.
        She was a delegate to the World Zionist Congress in 1987 and 1992 and was chairwoman of several Congress committees. She was also a member of the Zionist General Council.
        Not long after her election as president, she became a leading defender of a gay synagogue in New York, Congregation Beth Simchat Torah, which the American Zionist Youth Foundation suddenly shut out of the 1993 Salute to Israel Parade. She called the exclusion "a shameful surrender to the forces of right-wing orthodoxy" that had diminished the cause of Jewish unity.
        The congregation and its supporters among Reform organizations celebrated Israel's independence separately in a midtown synagogue that year.
        Ms. Cayne is survived by her husband, Maurice Cayne; a daughter, Naomi Finerman of San Rafael, Calif., and a brother, David Liebert of Carlsbad, Calif.
