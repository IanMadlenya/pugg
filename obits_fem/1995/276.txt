        Bella Fishko, an art dealer and founder of the Forum Gallery, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 81.
        The cause was heart failure, said her son, Robert, of Manhattan.
        Mrs. Fishko, whose original name was Bella Gold, was born in Odessa, Russia, in 1913 and moved to the United States with her parents in 1923. She attended Hunter College and in the early 1940's began working at the A.C.A. Gallery. After leaving A.C.A. in the late 1950's, she established the Forum Gallery, specializing in American figurative art. The artists represented by the gallery, now at 745 Fifth Avenue, include Raphael Soyer, Chaim Gross, David Levine and Gregory Gillespie. Mrs. Fishko retired in 1988 and was succeeded by her son.
        Mrs. Fishko's husband, Sol, died in 1989. In addition to her son, she is survived by a daughter, Sara Gill, and four grandchildren, all of Manhattan.
