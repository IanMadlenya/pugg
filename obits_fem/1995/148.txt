        Susan Braun, the founder and director of Dance Films Association, died on Tuesday night at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 79 and lived in Manahttan.
        Ms. Braun, who was born in Manhattan, studied at the Parsons School of Design and the Arts Students League. Childhood lessons with Anita Zahn in the technique of Isadora Duncan led to Ms. Braun's lifelong involvement in dance. It was her concern over the sparsity of filmed records of Duncan's worfk that led to the founding of the association, said Victor Lipari, its executive director.
        In 1950, Ms. Braun began to work with the New York Dance Film Society, an organization devoted primarily to showing 16-millimeter Russian ballet movies. She eventually became the society's co-director, with Daniel Livingston, its founder. When the society stopped functioning in 1956, Ms. Braun established Dance Films Association as a forum for makers of dance films, with a bi-monthly  newsletter and a competitive festival each winter. The association also compiled the Dance Film and Video Guide, an exhaustive catalogue of films on popular, concert, ethnic and historic dance that is published by Dance Horizons and the Princeton Book Company.
        Ms. Braus was a member of the Fine ARts and Philatelic Organization and of the Audobon Society.
        No immediate family members survive.
