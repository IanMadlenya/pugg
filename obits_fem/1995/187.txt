        Nina Verchinina, a Russian-born dancer who was one of the first classically trained ballerinas to be influenced by modern dance, died on Saturday at her home in Rio de Janeiro. She was 85.
        Miss Verchinina was born in Moscow and reared in Shanghai and Paris. She studied with many distinguished Paris-based teachers, among them the choreographer Bronislava Nijinska. But her style was transformed when she studied with pupils of the pioneering modern-dance choreographer Rudolf von Laban, whose theories helped her make her dancing emotionally eloquent as well as technically brilliant. She became noted for her mastery of dynamics and her fluid arm and torso movements.
        As a member of Col. W. de Basil's Ballets Russes from 1932 to 1937, she was  a favorite of the choreographer Leonide Massine, who created major roles for her in two of his monumentally scaled symphonic ballets of the 30's, "Les Presages"  and "Choreartium," both of which have recently been revived with success.
        She was ballet mistress at the Teatro Municipal of Rio de Janeiro from 1946 to 1947 and made Rio her home for the rest of her life, directing her own school there. She organized several companies and continued to be a guest teacher at studios around the world until shortly before her death.
        There are no immediate survivors.
