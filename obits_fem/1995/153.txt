        Kate Witte Ericson, an artist who collaborated with her husband, Mel Ziegler, on indoor and outdoor installation works noted for their beauty, complexity and  social awareness, died on Sunday at her home in Milanville, Pa. She was 39 and also had a home in Manhattan.
        The cause was brain cancer, her husband said.
        Ms. Ericson was born in Manhattan in 1955. She earned a bachelor of fine arts degree from the Kansas City Art Institute in 1978 and a master's from the California Institute of the Arts in 1982. She and Mr. Ziegler met as undergraduates and began working together in 1978, developing a style that featured provocative accumulations of materials and ideas, many of them involved with architecture, American history and the economy.
        One of their first solo shows, at the Los Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art in 1986, consisted of a display of all the wood necessary to raise a house,  with each piece carved with a phrase or adage about house or home. At the end of the exhibition, the wood was sold and used in the construction of a house.
        Ms. Ericson and Mr. Ziegler exhibited their work in many shows in the United  States and abroad, including the 1989 Whitney Biennial. Their most recent New York exhibition was in 1993 at the Michael Klein Gallery in SoHo.
        In addition to her husband, Ms. Ericson is survived by her parents, H. A. and Alma Ericson, of Norwalk, Conn., and a brother, Scott, of Arlington, Tex.
