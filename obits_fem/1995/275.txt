        Doris Carson Weisbard began her stage career at 17 when, as understudy for Ruby Keeler in the George and Ira Gershwin musical "Show Girl," she substituted for the star for two highly successful weeks. Her performance led to roles in shows including "Strike Up the Band" (1930), "The Cat and the Fiddle" (1931) and "On Your Toes" (1936), in which she appeared opposite Ray Bolger. She also performed in London, where she appeared on the West End in Cole Porter's "Nymph Errant," among other shows.
        She is survived by her husband, Leonard, and a sister, Janis Ogelvie.
