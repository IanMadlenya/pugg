        Ada Lublin Goldberg, for many years an advocate for the poor and homeless on Long Island, died Sunday at Hospice-by-the Sea in Boca Raton, Fla. A resident of North Bellmore, L.I., she was 67.
        The cause was renal failure stemming from kidney cancer, said her son, Lawrence A. Goldberg.
        Born in Brooklyn, Mrs. Goldberg became active in the League of Women Voters 40 years ago when she joined its Nassau County chapter. At her death, she was the chapter's director of social policy.
        In conjunction with her work for the league, she served on the board of the Health and Welfare Council of Nassau County, a coalition of social-welfare agencies and service organizations serving the poor. She received the council's Community Service Award last year.
        She also served on the executive board of the Nassau / Suffolk Coalition for a National Health Care Plan. In addition, she was active in the Child Care Council of Nassau County and the Nassau / Suffolk Coalition for the Homeless.
        Besides her son, a resident of Manhattan, Mrs. Goldberg is survived by her husband, Stanley; a daughter, Helene of New Haven; two brothers, Howard Lublin of Manhattan and Seldon Lublin of Newburgh, N.Y., and a granddaughter.
