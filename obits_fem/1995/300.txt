        Diane Cleaver, a literary agent and author, died on Monday in her apartment in Manhattan. She was 53.
        A spokeswoman for the Medical Examiner's office said the cause of death had not yet been established. But Heide Lange, vice president of the Sanford J. Greenburger agency, with which Ms. Cleaver was affiliated, said the doctor who had examined Ms. Cleaver said that the cause of death appeared to have been either a heart attack or stroke.
        Born in Birmingham, England, Ms. Cleaver became a United States citizen in 1976. She began her career in publishing at Doubleday, working her way up from editorial assistant to editor, and later became an editor at Straight Arrow Books, Charles Scribner's Sons and Simon & Schuster. In 1978, she formed her own literary agency, affiliated with the Greenburger agency.
        Her clients, a mixture of British and American authors, included John Fowles, Fay Weldon, Jamaica Kincaid, Peter Ackroyd, Beryl Bainbridge, Brigid Brophy, James Lardner and the estate of Laura Riding Jackson.
        Ms. Cleaver also wrote two novels under pseudonyms. The mystery novel "Sherbourne's Folly" (Doubleday, 1978) carried the name of Nora Barry. The novel "Morning Glory" (Pocket Books, 1973), about three generations of women in a Texas family, appeared under the name Julia Cleaver Smith. That novel, co-written with a fellow literary agent, Nikki Smith, became a best seller in 1984.
        That year, Ms. Cleaver wrote "The Literary Agent and the Writer: A Professional Guide," published by The Writer Inc.
        She is survived by her brother, Barry Cleaver of Birmingham, England.
