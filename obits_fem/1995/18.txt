        Dr. Janine Andre-Schwartz, an immunologist and specialist in electron microscopy, died on April 26 at New England Medical Center in Boston. She was 62 and lived in Brookline, Mass.
        The cause was cancer, said a spokeswoman at the center, where she was a medical researcher in the division of hematology/oncology.
        Dr. Andre-Schwartz was also an associate professor of medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine. She had been on the staff of both institutions for 26 years. Working with the electron microscope, she contributed to research on immunological disease.
        Dr. Andre-Schwartz did much of her research in collaboration with her husband, Dr. Robert S. Schwartz, now deputy editor of The New England Journal of Medicine.
        In addition to her husband, Dr. Andre-Schwartz is survived by a son, Louis-George Schwartz of New York City; two sisters, Francoise Poutiers of Bordeaux, France, and Claude Andre of Paris, and a brother, Jean-Pierre Andre, also of Paris.
