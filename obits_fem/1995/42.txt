        Estelle Brody, a star of British silent films, died on June 3 on the Mediterranean island of Malta, where she lived. She was 90.
        The Times of London, which reported her death on Thursday, said that Miss Brody "secured her place in the top league of British silent-film actresses after her fine performance in the title role of 'Mademoiselle From Armentieres.' " The film was made in 1926.
        Born either in New York or Montreal -- accounts differ -- she made half a dozen films in Britain in the 1920's and had secondary roles in several Hollywood talkies in the 1950's, including "Lili Marlene," "Safari" and "The Story of Esther Costello."
