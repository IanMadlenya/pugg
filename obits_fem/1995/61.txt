        Elizabeth Adams, the flamboyant Madam Alex who operated a Beverly Hills prostitution ring for two decades until she was arrested in 1988 and displaced by her former assistant, Heidi Fleiss, died on Saturday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 60.
        Peter L. Knecht, her longtime friend and lawyer, said that Mrs. Adams, a native of Manila, had had heart surgery and that her life support system was disconnected.
        After detectives testified Mrs. Adams had provided important information on murder suspects, drug dealers and terrorists, prosecutors agreed to a 1991 plea bargain in which she received 18 months probation.
        Although Mrs. Adams had complained that Miss Fleiss had stolen her client list, she continued to operate her business, Mr. Knecht said, most recently from a house abutting the parking lot of the West Hollywood sheriff's office.
        She is survived by her son, Scott, of Los Angeles.
