        Dr. Mary Dwight B. McNair Scott, a biochemistry professor at the University of Pennsylvania who was a pioneer in the identification of the B complex of vitamins and their functions, died on Feb. 9 at the Hahnemann Hospital in Philadelphia, where she lived. She was 87.
        The cause was a heart attack, said her husband, Dr. Thomas F. McNair Scott.
        In 1935, while she was completing work at Harvard University for a doctorate in biochemistry, she became one of the first women appointed to the faculty of the Harvard Medical School as a research associate.
        She married the following year and moved to England with her husband where she did research on the biochemistry of diabetes at the University College Medical School in London.
        From 1943 to 1946, while on the faculty of Wellesley College, she conducted studies identifying N-methyl nicotinamide in urine which contributed to the discovery of the B complex vitamin, niacin.
        After her husband completed his wartime service in England, the couple settled in Philadelphia, where she went to work for the University of Pennsylvania's Children's Hospital. From 1954 to 1965 she was in the School of Medicine's research medicine and physiology departments. In 1965 Dr. Scott moved to the School of Veterinary Medicine and retired in 1972.
        Besides her husband, she is survived by a son, Robert, of Bern, Switzerland; a daughter, Carolyn Hoehn of Heidelberg, Germany; a sister, Helen Sutton Gulick of Sacramento, Calif., and four grandchildren.
