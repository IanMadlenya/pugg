        Linda Sutter, a former journalist who developed the story line of the syndicated cartoon strip "Brenda Starr" in the early 1980's, died on Monday at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 54.
        The cause was cancer, her family said.
        She wrote the Brenda Starr story line for Tribune Media Services of Chicago  from 1982 to 1985, taking over from the strip's creator, Dale Messick. During her tenure, she began the character's gradual update from a fantasy figure to a modern career woman, said Ramona Fradan, a collaborator.
        Most recently, Ms. Sutter studied divinity at Harvard University, hoping to be ordained in the Episcopal Church. She had been on medical leave since her illness was diagnosed.
        A native of Greenwich, Conn., she graduated from Vassar College in 1961 and started a career as a network radio producer at NBC. She also worked for Metromedia Channel 5 in New York and WINS.
        Ms. Sutter is survived by her son, Joshua C. Empson of Greenwich; her parents, Clifford S. and Suzanne T. Sutter of Osterville, Mass.; three sisters,  Rebecca Breed of Greenwich, Tenney Auger of Portland, Me., and Michelle Hodgin of Los Angeles, and a brother, Samuel Sutter of Fall River, Mass.
