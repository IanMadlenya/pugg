        Jo Sinclair, who wrote about the struggles of immigrant families in America, died on April 4 at her home in Jenkintown, Pa. She was 81.
        The cause was cancer, said Joan Soffer, her companion.
        Ms. Sinclair, whose original name was Ruth Seid, was born in Brooklyn and moved to Cleveland with her family when she was 3 years old. She later used her adolescent and family experiences as the basis for her best-known works, "Wasteland" (1946) and "The Changelings" (1955). The former, about a first-generation American Jew who rejects his immigrant roots, won the Harper Prize Novel Award in 1946 and brought the author her first measure of fame as well as a $10,000 prize. "The Changelings" dealt with racial tensions in a changing city neighborhood and the friendship between two teen-age girls, one black, one white.
        She was also the author of "Sing at My Wake" (1951), "Anna Teller" (1960), and a 1993 memoir titled "The Seasons: Death and Transfiguration." Her work also appeared in magazines and journals and was widely anthologized.
        In addition to Ms. Soffer, she is survived by a sister, Fannie Stein of Cleveland.
