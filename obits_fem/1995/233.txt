        Pearl Wong, who with her husband, James, operated Pearl's Chinese Restaurant in mid-Manhattan, serving Cantonese fare to the famous and not-so-famous for 18 years until her retirement in 1985, died on Wednesday in her home in Manhattan. She was 86.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, said her sister, Emily Fong, also of Manhattan.
        When a restaurant that the Wongs had managed for years, Canton Village, changed hands in the mid-1960's, the couple found themselves without jobs. Almost as distressing, regular customers from the nearby Time-Life Building, who had depended on Mrs. Wong as their culinary guide, faced ordering meals on their own.
        The Wongs then began Pearl's Chinese Restaurant, with 52 investors buying single $500 shares, and the Wongs and a handful of other investors buying in at a higher level.
        The 68-seat establishment at 149 West 48th Street quickly became a popular haunt for theatrical celebrities. Its loyalty to Cantonese cuisine, while spicier Sichuan-Hunan fare was flourishing, brought in serious diners. Craig Claiborne, the food editor of The New York Times, called it "one of the neatest and best Chinese restaurants in all New York" in 1967.
        When the restaurant's quarters were razed for an office tower in 1973, it was moved to its current location at 38 West 48th Street, where the architectural firm of Gwathmey Siegel & Associates gave the interior a cool, sophisticated look.
        In 1985, Mrs. Wong joined her husband in retirement. She is survived by her husband and sister.
