        Cecil H. Roy, who supplied the voices for innumerable radio and animated film characters, died on Jan. 26 at Englewood Hospital in Englewood, N.J. She was 94 and lived at the Actors' Extended Care Facility in Englewood.
        Ms. Roy was born in St. Paul and reared in Oklahoma. She began her acting career with a stock company in Chicago, but soon turned to radio work, where her vocal versatility quickly made her known as "The Girl of a Thousand Voices." Able to imitate anyone from a crying baby to a cranky octogenarian, she frequently performed more than a score of character roles during a single hourlong radio program.
        Later in her career, she was the voice behind a number of animated film characters, among them Little Lulu and Caspar the Friendly Ghost. She also made recordings for children, including a portrayal of Winnie the Pooh on a recording with Jimmy Stewart. Among her many radio credits were "Ma Perkins," "The Rise of the Goldbergs," "The Henry Aldrich Show" and "Pepper Young's Family."
        She is survived by a son, Richard, of Montclair, N.J.; four grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.
