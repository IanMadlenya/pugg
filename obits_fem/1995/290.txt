        Jean Davis, a philanthropist and the mother of Marvin Davis, the billionaire financier and former owner of 20th Century Fox, died on Feb. 21 at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 94 and had lived most of her life in Manhattan.
        The cause was respiratory failure, said a spokesman for the family.
        In her later years, Mrs. Davis worked closely with her daughter-in-law, Barbara Davis, to raise money for the Children's Diabetes Foundation in Denver and for multiple sclerosis research. She was also active in raising money for the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, the Jewish Consumptive Relief Society and the United Jewish Appeal.
        Besides her son, Marvin, she is survived by 14 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.
