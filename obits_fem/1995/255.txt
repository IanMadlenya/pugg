        Janina Domanska, an author and illustrator of children's books, died on Feb. 2 at Naples Community Hospital in Naples, Fla. She was 82 and lived in New Fairfield, Conn.
        She had suffered a stroke recently, said her stepson Robert Nossen.
        Ms. Domanska was born in Warsaw and studied at the Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts. She came to the United States in 1952 and worked in New York City as a textile designer and freelance artist before turning to creating picture books for children.
        She wrote, adapted or translated 22 books, each accompanied by her own illustrations, which frequently evoked Polish folk art and drew upon folk tales from her childhood. She also illustrated 23 books by other authors. Among her best-known books are "If All the Seas Were One" (1971), "King Krakus and the Dragon" (1979), "Busy Monday Morning" (1985) and "A Was an Angler" (1991).
        In addition to her stepson Robert, of Naples, she is survived by her husband, Ernest Nossen; another stepson, Edward Nossen of Cherry Hill, N.J., and five stepgrandchildren.
