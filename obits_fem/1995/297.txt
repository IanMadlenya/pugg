In New York in the early 1980's, she acted in "Hedda Gabler" (starring Susannah York at the Roundabout Theater) and in "Memory of Whiteness" at the American Place Theater.
        Her movies include "Song Without End" (as Dirk Bogarde's mother), "Story on Page One," "Lolly Madonna" and "When Harry Met Sally," her last film, in 1989.
