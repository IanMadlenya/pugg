        Kathryn Haeseler Stone, a former Virginia legislator who challenged school segregation and a reapportionment plan that penalized urban voters, died last Friday at her home in Alexandria, Va. She was 88 and had been a longtime resident of Arlington, Va.
        Elected to the Virginia Legislature five months before the United States Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. the Board of Education in 1954, she became an early promoter of school desegregation. She was among those who argued that the state keep open its public schools and resist the spreading move to privatize schools as a means of resisting integration.
        Mrs. Stone was also one of four plaintiffs in a lawsuit challenging Virginia's reapportionment plan that reached the Supreme Court in 1964. The suit was joined with similiar efforts in other states that argued that the plans drawn by rural-dominated state legislatures were unfair to more heavily-populated areas. The Court's decision forced the redrawing of districts to balance the representation of urban and rural voters.
        A Democrat, she retired from the Virginia House in 1966.
        Born in Lisbon, Iowa, she received undergraduate and master's degrees from the University of Iowa in 1927 and 1932. With her husband, Harold A. Stone, she undertook in the late 1930's a study of some 25 county and town governments. With Donald K. Price, the Stones wrote two books published by the Public Service Administration in 1940, "City Manager Government in the U.S." and "Case Studies in City Manager Government."
        Besides her husband, she is survived by a son, Paul of Orwell, Vt.; two daughters, Suzanne Stone of Narbeth, Pa., and Joanna Stone of North Leverett, Mass.; a sister, Virginia M. Miller of Chula Vista, Calif.; five grandchildren and a great-grandchild.
