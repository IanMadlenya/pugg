        Grace Miceli, whose work as a costumer left an enduring legacy in the performing arts, died on Tuesday at the Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged in Manhattan. She was 81.
        In 1961, Ms. Miceli and her sister, Maria Brizzi, founded Grace Costumes Inc. and began providing costumes for opera, theater, ballet, film and television.
        Ms. Miceli's work for the New York City Opera began with the company's 1966  production of Handel's "Julius Caesar," with which it opened its first season at Lincoln Center. She also provided the costumes for the City Opera productions of "Don Rodrigo," "Roberto Deveraux," "Maria Stuarda" and "Anna Bolena" and for  the Washington Opera's production of Handel's "Ariodante."
        She worked extensively for both the New York City Ballet and American Ballet  Theater, and also made costumes for the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Dance Theater of Harlem and the Chicago, San Francisco and Seattle Ballets.
        On Broadway, Ms. Miceli's credits included "Fiddler on the Roof," "Cabaret,"  "She Loves Me," "The Wiz" and "Beauty and the Beast." Her final project was making Carol Channing's costumes for the current revival of "Hello, Dolly!"
        Ms. Miceli was born in Cleveland, spent her childhood in Italy and returned to the United States as an adult. Her first job was with the famed ballet costumer Karinska, first as protegee, then as collaborator.
        She is survived by her sister, who will continue to operate the company.
