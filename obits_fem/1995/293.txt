        Muriel Resnik, a novelist and playwright best known for her comedy "Any Wednesday," died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 78 and had recently lived in Beaufort, N.C.
        The cause was heart failure after a long illness, said her husband, Victor Jackson.
        "Any Wednesday," which starred Sandy Dennis, Don Porter, Gene Hackman and Rosemary Murphy, opened on Broadway in 1964 to rave reviews. The instant success of the play, Ms. Resnik's first, took even the author by surprise. In an interview, she said, "I was just praying it wouldn't be a complete bomb." It was later made into a movie starring Jane Fonda and Jason Robards.
        Ms. Resnik was born in New Haven. She wrote several novels, including "Life Without Father," "House Happy" and "The Girl in the Turquoise Bikini." She later wrote "Son of Any Wednesday," a reflection on the production of the play. In 1992, her first murder mystery, "The Garden Club," was published, and at her death she was nearing completion of a sequel.
        In addition to her husband, she is survived by two sons, Michael, of Chapel Hill, N.C., and Henry, of Berkeley, Calif.; two sisters, Lillian Stamler of Stony Creek, Conn., and Jean Krosner of New York City; three grandchildren, and a great-grandson.
