        Dr. Lorella Margaret Jones, a science educator and physicist known for her work in theoretical high-energy physics, died on Feb. 9 in a nursing home in Champaign, Ill. She was 51 and lived in Urbana, Ill.
        The cause was cancer, said colleagues at the physics department at the University of Illinois, where Dr. Jones was active as a professor of physics until a month ago.
        Dr. Jones served as director of the university's computer-based Education Research Laboratory from 1992 until last year. Her research centered on the experimental results involving the force holding together nuclear particles and the little bundles of energy called quarks.
        She was born in Toronto, the daughter of an astronomer and an industrial physicist. She earned a degree in mathematics at Harvard College and received her doctorate in physics at the California Institute of Technology.
        Aside from research sabbaticals in Britain, Germany, Japan and Tasmania, she spent her academic career at the University of Illinois. She joined the faculty as an assistant professor in 1968 and became a tenured professor in 1978.
        Her research resulted in 64 published papers. As a teacher, she also promoted the innovative use of computers in physics education and helped to develop computerized quizzes for elementary physics courses.
        Dr. Jones is survived by her parents, Donald and Shirley Jones of Urbana, and a sister, Irene Jones of Livermore, Calif.
