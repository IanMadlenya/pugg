        Jolie Hammer Kinsolving, a government affairs adviser and a former deputy borough president of Manhattan, died on Monday at Mount Sinai Hospital. A resident of the Upper East Side, she was 62.
        The cause was cancer, her family said.
        She went to work for City Council President Sanford Garelik in 1970, often representing him on the Board of Estimate. Manhattan Borough President Percy Sutton named her his deputy in 1974.
        In 1978, she became an aide to Robert F. Wagner Jr., then chairman of the City Planning Commission and later deputy mayor. Since leaving government in 1985, she worked for the Manhattan law firm of Rosenman & Colin.
        She is survived by her husband, Charles M. Kinsolving Jr.; a son, Ronald Hammer of Darien, Conn.; a brother, Dr. Richard Brockman of Manhattan; a sister, Susan Brockman of Manhattan; her stepmother, Elizabeth Brockman of Manhattan, and one grandson. Her marriage to Gordon Hammer ended in divorce.
