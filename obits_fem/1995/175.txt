        Ethel T. Chamberlain, who dedicated her life to the Salvation Army and served as national president of its women's organizations from 1974 to 1977, died on Wednesday at a Salvation Army retirement home in Asbury Park, N.J. She was 86.
        From the time she attended an open-air meeting as a 9-year-old in Malone, N.Y., Mrs. Chamberlain was devoted to the Salvation Army and its principles of service to others. She entered its training school in the Bronx at the age of 17 and spent her entire career with the religious and philanthropic organization.
        An inspirational speaker who filled church pews in the 1950's, 60's, and 70's, starting in a time when women were rarely allowed at church pulpits, Mrs.  Chamberlain encouraged women to transcend sexual stereotypes. She served on the  National Board of Directors of Church Women United.
        Her husband, William E. Chamberlain, was the Salvation Army's national president.
        Mrs. Chamberlain is survived by four daughters, Alice Baxendale of Clearwater, Fla., Jean C. Mosher of DeWitt, N.Y., Roberta C. Schofield of Cazenovia, N.Y., and Carol Appleby of Columbia, S.C.; 10 grandchildren; seven great-grandchildren, and two sisters, Helen Covell of Tucson, Ariz., and Erma Mowers of Syracuse.
