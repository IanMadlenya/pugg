        Edith Pargeter, a British author of mysteries and historical fiction who wrote a series of novels under the pen name Ellis Peters about a sleuthing 12th  century monk named Brother Cadfael, died Saturday. She was 82 and lived in Shropshire, England.
        The cause was a stroke, said her biographer, Margaret Lewis.
        Ms. Pargeter wrote approximately 90 books, the first in 1936 and the last in 1994. Her novels about Brother Cadfael, an herbalist at the Benedictine abbey in Shrewsbury with a knack for solving murders, received wide acclaim.
        The first of 20 Brother Cadfael books appeared in 1977. They included "The Potter's Field" (1990), "The Confession of Brother Haluin" (1989) and "The Hermit of Eyton Forest" (1988), all published by Mysterious Press.
        Last January, some of the Brother Cadfael novels were dramatized in four 90-minute segments of the television program "Mystery."
        The British Tourist Authority has published a brochure, "Brother Cadfael Car  Trails," offering directions through the hamlets and villages of Shropshire, where most of her stories were set.
        Ms. Pargeter was born on September 28, 1913, in Shropshire, just three miles  from the house where she died in the town of Madeley. During World War II, she joined the Women's Royal Naval Service and in 1944 she received the British Empire Medal for distinguished service. She has no immediate survivors.
