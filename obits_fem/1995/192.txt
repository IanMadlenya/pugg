        Alexina Duchamp, the widow of Marcel Duchamp, died on Wednesday at her home in Villiers-sous-Grez, near Paris. She was 89.
        As a former daughter-in-law of Henri Matisse, the widow of Duchamp and a close friend of John Cage and Jasper Johns, she was in her later years the unquestioned doyenne of the survivors of a great age in art, dance and music.
        She had close ties to Philadelphia and took pride in being an honorary trustee of its Museum of Art, which has by far the largest collection of Duchamp's work. She was delighted when in 1967 his last major work, the scenographic "Etant Donnes," or "Given," was installed there.
        "Etant Donnes" had been built in secret in New York between 1964 and 1966, a  time when Duchamp was believed to have stopped working forever. During much of its construction, Mrs. Duchamp was her husband's sole confidante.
        Alexina Sattler was born in Cincinnati on Jan. 6, 1906, the daughter of Dr. Robert Sattler, an ophthalmologist who ran his own hospital with a free clinic attached, and his second wife, the former Agnes Mitchell.
        She at first thought of becoming an artist and for a time studied sculpture with Brancusi in Paris. In December 1929 she married the son of Henri Matisse, Pierre, who was to become a distinguished art dealer on Madison Avenue. When her husband was mobilized in Paris at the outbreak of World War II, she ran the gallery for some months.
        After a divorce from Pierre Matisse in 1949, she married Duchamp in 1954. They lived in New York, in Paris and in the summer in Cadaques in northern Spain. After Duchamp's death in 1968, she became close to the composer Cage and  to a new circle of friends.
        She is survived by the three children of her marriage to Matisse, Jacqueline, Paul and Peter, and by 12 grandchildren.
