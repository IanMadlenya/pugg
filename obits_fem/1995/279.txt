        Beverly Reitz, an interior designer known for her innovative use of light, died on Sunday in Hightstown, N.J., where she had lived since 1990.
        She was 94 and had been a resident of Manhattan for much of her life. She also had a home in Ridgefield, Conn.
        The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease, said Clint Wade of Manhattan, a longtime friend.
        Mrs. Reitz worked mainly with residences, using light to create moods. But she also designed the Women's Faculty Lounge at Columbia University and helped in redesigning the Swiss Embassy in Washington.
        She was twice president of the Decorators Club of New York.
        Her husband, Harold A. Reitz, died in 1976. She is survived by a sister, Amy Nell Hayes, also of Hightstown.
