        Elaine Greene, a leading literary agent in Britain, died on Jan. 10 at a hospice in London. She was 74 and lived in London.
        The cause was lung and brain cancer, said Jed Mattes, her affiliate in New York.
        Ms. Greene was born in New York City to Louis and Fanny Gilbert and was educated at Mount Holyoke College and the Sorbonne. She worked in the editorial departments of Random House and Alfred A. Knopf, then moved to London, where she became director of the literary department of MCA London. When MCA dissolved that department in 1961, she formed her own literary agency and soon numbered Arthur Miller, Theodor S. Geisel (Dr. Seuss) and P. D. James among her clients.
        Ms. Greene's two marriages, to the American journalist Robert Shaplen and to Sir Hugh Greene, a former director of the BBC, ended in divorce.
        She is survived by two sons from her second marriage, Christopher and Timothy, both of London, and a brother, Ted Gilbert of Stamford, Conn.
