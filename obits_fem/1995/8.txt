        Mildred Finger Haines, who helped shape fashion tastes for four decades as a top buyer for department stores and a consultant to clothes makers and retailers, died on Saturday. She was 71 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause of death was a heart attack, family members said.
        From the late 1940's through the late 1960's, Mrs. Haines, known throughout her career as Mildred Finger, was a buyer of ready-to-wear at Macy's, Ohrbach's and Bergdorf Goodman, and one of New York City's most often cited taste makers. At Bergdorf's, in particular, she was noted for bringing European styles to American consumers.
        She later became vice president of Charles of the Ritz, headed fashion merchandising for Yves St.Laurent and became an independent consultant, with clients like the Limited and Arthur D. Little.
        Suffering from multiple sclerosis, she retired in 1986. In succeeding years, she frequently contributed her knowledge of the fashion industry to the oral history projects of the American Jewish Committee and the Fashion Institute of Technology.
        Mrs. Haines is survived by her husband, Robert; two sons, Matthew and Daniel, both of Manhattan; a sister, Bella Finger Kleinman of the Bronx; a daughter-in-law, Francine Kane of Manhattan, and a grandson.
