        Crosby Newell Bonsall, the author and illustrator of more than 40 children's books, died on Jan. 10 at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, where she lived. She was 74.
        The cause was a stroke, said Barbara Phillips, her niece.
        Ms. Bonsall began her career at an advertising agency, where she sold the rights to one of her drawings to a doll manufacturer. She then created a family of dolls, which were used as characters in her first book, "Tell Me Some More," which was published in 1961.
        Although she began as an illustrator, she quickly turned to writing.  "Tell Me Some More," illustrated by Fritz Siebel, was published by Harper & Row as part of its I Can Read series, which is still in print. She wrote the text for the photographer Ylla's "I'll Show You Cats" (1964), an award-winning children's book.
        She was born in Kew Gardens, Queens, and studied at the New York University School of Architecture and the American School of Design.
        In addition to Ms. Phillips of Paterson, N.J., she is survived by her husband, George, and a sister, Marion Phillips of Manahawkin, N.J.
