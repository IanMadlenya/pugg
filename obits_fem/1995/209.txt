        Rosalind K. Loring, a specialist in continuing education, adviser to Federal  agencies and university administrator, died on Dec. 18 at her home in Los Angeles. She was 78.
        The cause was cancer, her family said.
        Over the years, Mrs. Loring was a consultant to the National Endowment for the Humanities, president of the Adult Education Association/ U.S.A. and a board member of the National University Extension Association. She retired in 1984 as associate provost for extended education at the University of Southern California.
        She was born in Philadelphia and graduated in art and education from the University of California at Los Angeles, where she also earned a master's degree in adult education. In the late 1950's, U.C.L.A. engaged her to implement her ideas on improving the educational and professional status of women. To that end she developed programs of continuing education for women and similar ones to raise the educational levels of veterans.
        Mrs. Loring is survived by her husband of more than 50 years, Murrel Loring;  a daughter, Sherry Loring-Warren of Los Angeles; a son, David, of Reno; a sister, Lois Mudrick of Los Angeles, and three grandsons.
