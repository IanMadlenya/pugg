        Sonia Moore, the founder and leader of the American Center for Stanislavsky Theater Art and the Sonia Moore Studio of the Theater, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 92.
        Mrs. Moore, an expert on Konstantin Stanislavsky, directed plays Off Broadway and was a writer and teacher. For more than 30 years she ran her center and studio, where she trained actors in the theatrical principles and theories of the Russian director and also researched his writings. She continued teaching until February.
        She was born in Gomel, Belarus, and studied at the Moscow Art Theater. In 1940, she came to the United States. Mrs. Moore was the author of "Logic of Speech on Stage," "The Stanislavsky Method" (with a preface by John Gielgud), "The Stanislavsky System," "Training an Actor: The Stanislavsky System in Class" and "Stanislavsky Revealed: The Actor's Complete Guide to Spontaneity on Stage."
        She was the widow of Leon Moore, a former Soviet diplomat who became an adviser to Allen Dulles when he was the Director of Central Intelligence. She is survived by a daughter, Irene Moore Jaglom, who teaches acting; a granddaughter, Leona Jaglom Hirsch; a grandson, Andre R. Jaglom, and four great-grandchildren.
