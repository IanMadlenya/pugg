        Judith Lane Rand, a novelist who also worked in radio and advertising, died on Nov. 21 at her home in Bridgehampton, N.Y. She was 64.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, her family said.
        Mrs. Rand wrote daily radio shows for James Beard, Arlene Francis, Dorothy and Mary Rodgers and Dione Lucas, among others. She also contributed articles to New York magazine and was the author of several novels, including "Fevered Sands." One of her books, "Paper Castles," was the basis of a 1984 CBS movie, "He's Fired, She's Hired." With her husband, John, she wrote and produced "Quick Changes," a satirical revue that had a successful run in Chicago. She also wrote two award-winning industrial films.
        In addition to her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Eliza Damiecki  of Bridgehampton, L.I., and Hilary Adams of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
