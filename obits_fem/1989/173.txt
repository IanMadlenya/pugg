        Hibari Misora, known as ''the queen'' of Japanese singers, died of heart failure today after a long illness. She was 52 years old.
        Born Kazue Kato, Miss Misora's stage name means ''skylark beautiful sky.'' From the time in 1948 when she made her debut, at age 11, her songs cheered people left hopeless by Japan's defeat in World War II.
        Masao Yamaguchi, a professor at Tokyo Foreign Language University, credited Miss Misora with a role in helping the nation's recovery and economic growth in the postwar era.
        Miss Misora released 1,200 songs and sold 68 million records, including 45 million singles. She received numerous awards and was an actress in many Japanese musical movies and plays.
