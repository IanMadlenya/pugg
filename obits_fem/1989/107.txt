        The Milottes worked for Walt Disney for 11 years. They spent much of that time in Alaska, Africa and Australia, collecting footage that appeared in such films as ''The African Lion,'' ''Beaver Valley,'' ''Seal Island,'' ''The Alaskan Eskimo'' and ''Nature's Half Acre.''
        They owned a photography studio in Alaska, and were independent film makers there before joining Disney studios.
        They retired from motion pictures in 1959. The Milottes also collaborated on three animal tales published by Alfred A. Knopf: ''The Story of the Platypus,'' ''The Story of a Hippopotamus'' and ''The Story of an Alaskan Grizzly Bear.''
