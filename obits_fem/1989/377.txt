        Marcella Cisney, a theater director and administrator, died of cancer on Friday at Yale-New Haven Hospital in Connecticut. She was 76 years old.
        She was network director for CBS in the early 1950's, and she directed the New York City Opera in 1957-58 when it was at City Center. She began her theater career as a director and producer of Off Broadway and summer-theater productions, and headed theaters in the 1940's in Jacksonville, Fla., Pasadena, Calif., Laguna Beach, Calif., and Hollywood.
        She also spent a year as head coach at Warner Brothers Studio in 1948, and taught at Columbia University in 1955. She helped found the Professional Theater Program at the University of Michigan, which she directed from 1961 to 1973.
        She directed many New York and touring productions, including ''An Evening's Frost,'' a 1964 show about Robert Frost that she also conceived. As theater chairwoman of the Westport-Weston (Conn.) Arts Council in the early 1980's, she produced a play-reading series called Works in Progress.
        She is survived by her husband, Robert Schnitzer, of Weston.
