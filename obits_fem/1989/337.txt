        Mrs. Serger specialized in early-20th-century European avant-garde art. Sine 1964, she presented many highly praised exhibitions at her gallery, La Boetie, on the Upper East Side. She had shows on pioneering women, European abstractionism, German and Austrian Expressionism, the Wiener Werkstatte, Dadaism and the art of the Bauhaus.
        Among the German and Austrian artists that Mrs. Serger exhibited were Kurt Schwitters, Emil Nolde, Paul Klee, Wassily Kandinsky and Egon Schiele.
        Mrs. Serger was born in Silesia, now part of Poland, and collected art in the 1930's with her husband, Frederick, an artist. After two years in England, the Sergers moved to New York in 1941. She became a private art dealer in the late 1950's.
        Mrs. Serger is survived by her brother, Oscar Spitzer, of Manhattan.
