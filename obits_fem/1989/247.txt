        Fernanda Wanamaker Munn Kellogg, a philanthropist interested in wildlife, conservation and other concerns, died of heart failure Sunday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 69 years old and also lived in Manhattan.
        Mrs. Kellogg, a descendant of John Wanamaker, founder of the Philadelphia-based department store chain, became interested in conservation as early as age 8, when she first began hunting.
        In the early 1960's, she founded the Louwana Fund to preserve wildlife. In 1963 the fund bought the first equipment to maintain wildlife habitats in Kenya and in 1967 established the first anti-poaching units in East Africa. Mrs. Kellogg also served on the board of the African Wildlife Foundation.
        She was a board member of Just One Break, a Manhattan-based employment agency for the handicapped; the Triangle Club, a Palm Beach organization for the rehabilitation of alcohol and drug abusers, and Gratitude House, a half-way house for recovering alcoholics and drug abusers in Palm Beach.
        Her marriage to Francis L. Kellogg of Manhattan ended in divorce in 1971.
        She is survived two children, Christopher G., and Fernanda Gilligan, both of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
