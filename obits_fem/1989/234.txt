        Mrs. Murphy joined the company in 1935 and was named president in 1949. Earlier she had served as executive vice president and as chairwoman of the company's executive committee. She was one of the few female chief executives in the textile industry at that time.
        In 1955, she was elected a director of the National Association of Wool Manufacturers, the first woman to hold the position. The same year, Fortune magazine listed her as one of the country's top seven women in business.
        She was a member of the New York State Women's Council. She retired in 1961.
        She is survived by a daughter, Avis Godbout of Dublin, N.H.; four grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
