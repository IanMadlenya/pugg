        Mrs. Willis, whose grandfather, Harvey S. Firestone Sr., founded the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company in Akron, Ohio, had been a member of the National Council of the Metropolitan Opera Association and a trustee of the Archives of American Art and the New England Conservatory of Music.
        In recent years, Mrs. Willis, a pianist, devoted herself to jazz, making appearances with Mel Torme, Lionel Hampton, Gene Krupa and B. B. King. Most recently, in collaboration with Mr. Hampton, she wrote ''The George Bush Election Theme.''
        In Dwight D. Eisenhower's Presidential campaigns she served as musical coordinator.
        She began her career composing music for children's broadcasting.
        She is survived by her mother, Elizabeth Firestone of Akron and Newport, R.I.; a daughter, Elizabeth Leatherman of Boston, and two sisters, Martha Ford of Detroit and Anne Ball of Greenwich, Conn.
