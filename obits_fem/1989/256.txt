        Mrs. Johnson, a native of Pleasantville, N.Y., helped recruit, organize and train staff in Westchester County for the exchange group, which has headquarters in Brattleboro, Vt. She was a trustee of the organization from 1964 to 1978.
        A 1942 graduate of Rollins College in Winter Park, Fla., she returned to school at age 50 and graduated from the New York University School of Law in 1974.
        In 1976, she joined the staff of District Council 37, the union that represents most New York City employees. She helped establish the union's Legal Services Plan, which provides free civil legal services for municipal employees in union jurisdiction. The plan grew to include 120,000 municipal workers and employ more than 65 lawyers. She retired in 1987.
        She is survived by her husband, Frank H.; three children, Judith Thoms of Manhattan, Allan, of Seattle, Deborah, of Washington, and four grandchildren.
