        When Miss Murphy sang her pop tunes and jazz classics in the 1940's and 50's she spiced them with twitterings, chirrups and occasionally the sound ''chee chee,'' with which she became identified and which provided her nickname. She was known for her highly personalized rendition of ''I Can't Give You Anything but Love.''
        In the 1960's she performed regularly at the Cookery in Greenwich Village.
        There are no survivors.
