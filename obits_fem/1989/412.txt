        Dorothy E. Rowe, former senior vice president of the American Research and Development Corporation, died Thursday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. She was 72 years old and lived in Boston.
        Ms. Rowe joined the corporation, one of the nation's first public venture-capital investment companies, in 1949 at the request of Georges F. Doriot, its founder.
        Over the years she was a director of several companies financed by American Research, including the Digital Equipment Corporation, of which she was the first treasurer and a director. She retired in 1974. The company later merged into Textron Inc.
        She was a former trustee of Emerson College and a vice president and trustee of the French Library in Boston.
        Ms. Rowe is survived by two sisters, Barbara DuBois of Taos, N.M., and Mary Edith Parfitt of Rockport, Mass.
