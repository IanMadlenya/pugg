        Mrs. Allen, long active in Alabama politics, was auditor from 1967 to 1975 and treasurer from 1975 to 1978. A crusader against corruption, she was credited with helping to win the adoption of a state ethics law in 1973.
        In 1978 she was convicted of using her office as treasurer to obtain bank loans to build a theme park and of failing to make full disclosure of her personal finances.
        Mrs. Allen, who denied any wrongdoing, was sentenced to six years in jail and three and a half years of probation. She spent 30 days in jail and the rest of her sentence living and working as a bookkeeper at a Montgomery retirement home.
        A Democrat, she sought the party nomination for United States Senator in 1972, losing to Senator John J. Sparkman.
        She is survived by her husband, Marvin; a daughter, a son, her mother, three sisters, seven brothers and six grandchildren.
