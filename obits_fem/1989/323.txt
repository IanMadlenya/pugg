        Mildred Bennett, an authority on the novelist Willa Cather, died of lung cancer on Tuesday. She was 80 years old.
        Mrs. Bennett's interest in Cather began in 1932 when she was the new schoolteacher in the heart of the farming country described in Cather's novels. Many of her pupils were the children and grandchildren of the people Cather immortalized in her Nebraska stories.
        Mrs. Bennett guided the Willa Cather Pioneer Memorial and Educational Foundation formed in 1955. The foundation created a living museum of nearly 50 sites in Red Cloud and the surrounding countryside that are points of historical interest in Cather's life and stories.
        In 1951, she published ''The World of Willa Cather,'' about the early life of the novelist. Her ''Early Stories of Willa Cather'' appeared in 1957.
        Mrs. Bennett is survived by her husband, Wilbur.
