        Louisa Dresser Campbell, former curator of collections at the Worcester (Mass.) Art Museum and a specialist in early American painting and American decorative arts, died of a systemic infection on Friday at the Medical Center of Central Massachusetts-Memorial in Worcester. She was 81 years old and lived in Worcester.
        An early researcher in pre-Revolutionary American art, Mrs. Campbell was the author of ''Seventeenth-Century Painting in New England,'' a pioneer study of Colonial portraiture. In 1963, she was instrumental in the acquisition of two famous 17th-century New England folk portraits for the museum titled ''Mrs. Freake and Baby Mary'' and ''John Freake.''
        Mrs. Campbell was a graduate of Vassar College, and she also studied at Harvard University, the Courtauld Institute of the University of London and Clark University. She joined the staff of the Worcester Art Museum in 1932 as associate curator of decorative arts, and from 1949 until her retirement in 1972 she was curator of collections.
        After she retired, Mrs. Campbell was an honorary trustee of the museum, and for several years served as editor of catalogues of its European and American painting collections.
        She is survived by two sisters, Rose L. Dresser and Frances M. Herron, both of Worcester.
