        Miss Ryerson was known for her portraits of children, and many of her prints are in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Smithsonian Institution, the Brooklyn Museum and other American museums. For many years she exhibited her works with Grand Central Art Galleries, and she received awards from the Hudson Valley Art Association and the National Arts Club on Gramercy Park in New York, where she lived for more than 30 years.
        Miss Ryerson studied art with Robert Henri and Charles Hawthorne, and edited Mr. Henri's ''Art Spirit,'' a book on the philosophy of art. She was also a co-editor of ''Hawthorne on Painting'' and frequently wrote about art for magazines, newspapers and art journals.
        Miss Ryerson was a descendant of one of the first Dutch families to settle in the United States and her ancestral home in New Jersey, Ringwood Manor, is now a state park.
        There are no survivors.
