        Eliana Martinez, an AIDS patient whose mother successfully fought a court ruling that the child be in a glass cage in school classes, died of the disease on Monday. She was 8 years old.
        Eliana contracted AIDS as an infant from a tainted blood transfusion. The disease was not diagnosed until 1985.
        Her mother, Rosa Martinez, a licensed practical nurse, adopted her as an abandoned 11-month-old in a Puerto Rico hospital.
        Officials of the Hillsborough County School Board officials had wanted the child kept home, fearing she posed a health risk. A judge ruled Eliana could attend school if she stayed inside a special glass booth. But Mrs. Martinez appealed the decision. In April Eliana went to school for children with special needs, without the enclosure.
