        Mrs. Tanner was an associate professor of anthropology at the University of California at Santa Cruz and a fellow of the university's Merrill College. She joined the faculty in 1969 from the University of Chicago, where she had earned her bachelor's and master's degrees.
        Her doctoral dissertation at the University of California at Berkeley laid the groundwork for her fieldwork and studies with matrilineal Moslems in West Sumatra, Indonesia.
        Mrs. Tanner's book, ''On Becoming Human,'' published by Cambridge Press in 1981, reconstructed early social behavior from field studies of primates and of human food-gathering societies, as well as from fossil and archeological data. In the book Mrs. Tanner developed , a theory of human origins that focused on the role of female food-gatherers in evolution.
        Mrs. Tanner, who lived in Santa Cruz, is survived by her husband, Jim Moore; two daughters, Elna Brunckhorst of Berkeley and Elizabeth Brunckhorst of Felton, Calif.; a stepmother, Edith Tanner of Green Bay, Wis.; a brother, Tom Tanner of Yorkville, Ill., and a grandson.
