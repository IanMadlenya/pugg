        Dr. Greenacre, a native of Chicago, came to New York in the 1930's to direct the outpatient unit of the Payne-Whitney Psychiatric Clinic at New York Hospital. She remained there until the late 1940's, when she went into private practice in Manhattan. She retired at the age of 90 and moved to Garrison.
        Dr. Greenacre wrote several books dealing with the development of infants and small children, including ''Trauma, Growth and Personality,'' (W. W. Norton; 1952) and ''Swift and Carrol: A Psychoanalytic Study of Two Lives,'' (International Universities Press; 1955). She was a former president of the American Psychoanalytic Association. She was professor emeritus of clinical psychiatry at Cornell University Medical College.
        Dr. Greenacre is survived by a daughter, Ann R. Roy of New Orleans; a son, Dr. Peter Richter of Manhattan; eight grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.
