        Miss Farrally and her former teacher, Gweneth Lloyd, founded the Royal Winnipeg Ballet 50 years ago. The two women immigrated to Canada from England shortly before World War II, started a dance studio and developed the company from a performance club for their best students. Miss Farrally was principal dancer and ballet mistress before becoming artistic director in the early 1950's. She left the company in 1954.
