        Ida Ehre, one of West Germany's best-known actresses, died of a heart attack today. She was 88 years old.
        She is credited with being a major force in reviving the German theater after World War II. She founded her theater, the Hamburg Kammerspiele, seven months after Germany's defeat in 1945.
        Miss Ehre, born to Austrian Jewish parents, was banned from the stage in 1933 after moving to Berlin.
        Among the earliest works she staged at the Kammerspiele was ''The Man Outside,'' a play by Wolfgang Borchert about the torments of a German soldier after his return home from the war.
        She studied at the Academy for Music and Theater in Vienna. She gave her first professional performance in 1918 and performed in dozens of European cities.
        She continued to act after founding the Kammerspiele, and one of her best-remembered performances was in the title role of Bertolt Brecht's ''Mother Courage.''
