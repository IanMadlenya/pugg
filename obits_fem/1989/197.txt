        When France fell to the Germans in 1940, Mrs. Fourcade and a few friends organized a Resistance group called Alliance, which eventually numbered about 3,000. Of that number, one-third were jailed or killed by the Germans.
        The Germans caught Mrs. Fourcade four times, but she was released or escaped each time.
        Each of the group's agents took the name of an animal, and she was known as Hedgehog. In 1968, she published a book about her experiences entitled ''Noah's Ark.''
        After the war, she helped found the party led by Charles de Gaulle.
