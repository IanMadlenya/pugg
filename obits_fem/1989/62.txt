        Ms. Quinn, a 1976 graduate of St. John's, began her career in 1978 as the school's assistant sports-information director. She became the director in 1983, when it was still unusual for a woman to be the sports-information director for a major college athletic program. She also helped coordinate news-media services at the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984.
        She is survived by her parents, Charles and Maria Quinn of Old Westbury, L.I.; a sister, Odilie Esposito of Westbury, L.I., and a brother, Timothy of East Northport, L.I.
