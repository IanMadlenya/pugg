        Mary Alice Rice, a retired producer of fashion shows and former showgirl, died Monday at Overlook Hospital in Summit, N,J., after a long illness. She was 78 years old and lived in Summit.
        Ms. Rice came to Manhattan from Temple, Tex., in 1930 and got a job in the chorus of George White's ''Flying High.'' In 1931, Flo Ziegfeld put her in the Follies and later declared her one of ''the 10 most beautiful girls on the American stage.''
        In the early 1940's, Ms. Rice convinced the Plaza Hotel, among others, that regular runway fashion shows for charity would attract patrons, and from 1942 to 1987, when she retired, she produced the Plaza's annual Easter show, along with numerous others for the Pierre, the St. Regis and similar hotels.
        In 1954, she married William L. Evers, then the executive director of the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation.
        In addition to her husband, she is survived by her mother, Letra Rice of Daytona Beach, Fla.; a stepdaughter, Danica Ridgeway of Summit, and eight grandchildren.
