Miss Gibbons, who was a journalist before she turned to books, wrote more than 30 novels and volumes of short stories and poems, but none rivaled her most celebrated story, which parodied an earthy, regional school of writing popular at the turn of the century.

        Miss Gibbons's second husband, the actor and singer Allan Webb, died in 1959.
