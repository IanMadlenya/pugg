        Cynthia Hughes, co-editor and publisher of The Grenada Newsletter, died on Wednesday after a short illness. She was 72 years old, and the cause of death was not made public.
        With her husband, Alister, she was instrumental in getting news out during the military overthrow of Maurice Bishop in 1983. That coup led to the American invasion of the island.
        Along with her husband, she is survived by two daughters and a son.
