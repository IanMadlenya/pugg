        Marcia Whitney Schott, a prominent figure on the American horse racing scene for almost 30 years, died of cancer yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 66 years old.
        Mrs. Schott's familiar red, white and blue racing colors were carried by a number of outstanding horses, including Willow Hour, who won the Jim Dandy and Travers Stakes at Saratoga Springs, N.Y., in 1981. In the Travers, Willow Hour beat Pleasant Colony, winner of the Kentucky Derby.
        With her husband, Lewis, a retired executive, Mrs. Schott supported the University of Florida and its law school, from which she graduated. The couple established a chair in her name at the university.
        She also took an active interest in design and was associated with Marcia W. Schott Interiors, a decorating concern in Manhattan, for about 15 years until shortly before her death.
        In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Lady de Rothschild of London; two sons, Nash, of Washington, and Steven, of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
