        Amanda Blake, who played the kindhearted saloonkeeper Miss Kitty in the ''Gunsmoke'' television series for 19 years, died of oral cancer on Wednesday at Mercy General Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 60 years old.
        Miss Blake, a one-time two-pack-a-day cigarette smoker, had surgery for oral cancer in 1977, and afterward made appearances throughout the country for the American Cancer Society. In 1984, she was the recipient of the society's annual Courage Award.
        Miss Blake, whose name originally was Beverly Louise Neill, was born Feb. 20, 1929, in Buffalo, her CBS biography prepared during ''Gunsmoke'' states. She was educated in Buffalo, Gainesville, Ga., and Claremont, Calif., where she moved with her parents in 1943.
        She signed a contract with M-G-M while still a teen-ager, and her first film role was in ''Stars in My Crown'' (1950). Miss Blake was at CBS when she heard that the ''Gunsmoke'' radio show was going to be made into a television pilot.
        ''I knew I had to have the part of Kitty, so I hounded the producer until I got it,'' she said in a 1971 interview. On the Show Until 1974
        The first show was in 1955. Set in late-19th-century Dodge City, Kan., it starred Jim Arness as Marshal Matt Dillon. Miss Blake left the series in 1974. It went off the air the next year.
        After ''Gunsmoke,'' Miss Blake worked only sporadically, usually making guest appearances on television game shows, made-for-television movies and television series including ''Hart to Hart'' and ''Love Boat.''
        Her fifth marriage, in April 1984 to Mark Spaeth, an Austin, Tex., city councilman and developer, ended in divorce.
