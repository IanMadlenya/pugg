        Dr. Rosamond Kane, an orthopedic surgeon, died of breast cancer yesterday at the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 62 years old and lived in Rye, N.Y.
        Dr. Kane, a 1952 graduate of Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, was the first female resident at the New York Orthopaedic Hospital, now part of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center.
        In 1974, she gave up private practice in pediatric orthpedics because of high premiums for medical malpractice insurance but continued as an associate professor of orthpedic surgery at the College of Physicians and Surgeons and as a physician at Columbia-Presbyterian, where she was director of the Children's Foot Clinic.
        She is survived by her husband, Dr. F. Mitchell Cummins; a daughter, Rosamond Mitchell Cummins of Boston, and a son, Christopher K. Cummins, of Manhattan.
