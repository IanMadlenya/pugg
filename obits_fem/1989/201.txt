        Ms. Naylor, a native of Springfield, Mass., studied at the New School in the 1930's and began her career with The Associated Press.
        Photographs she made of life in Brazil on assignment for the State Department were given a one-woman show at the Museum of Modern Art in 1945 and led to her being hired by Vogue and Harper's Bazaar.
        Ms. Naylor's late husband was the painter Misha Reznikoff. She is survived by two sons, Peter Reznikoff of Manhattan, and Michael Reznikoff of Tokyo; a sister, Cynthia Gillispie of Chicago, and two grandchildren.
