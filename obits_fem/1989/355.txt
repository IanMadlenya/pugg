        Dorothy Fuldheim, a news commentator and interviewer who remained on television beyond the age of 90, died of complications from a stroke today at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 96 years old.
        Ms. Fuldheim began her television career in 1947, when she was 54 years old, in as the anchorwoman for WEWS-TV. She was with the station for nearly 37 years. Before her television career, Ms. Fuldheim was the first female news commentator on the ABC radio network.
        WEWS eventually replaced Ms. Fuldheim as anchor, but gave her a commentary segment on the nightly news until her retirement five years ago after she suffered a stroke.
        For radio or television, a WEWS spokesman said, she interviewed Albert Einstein, Adolf Hitler and every President from Franklin Delano Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan.
        She was born in Passaic, N.J., and grew up in Milwaukee. Two husbands and a daughter had died earlier.
