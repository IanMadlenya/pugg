        Dr. Pfeiffer, a native of Chicago, received her bachelor's and doctor's degrees from the University of Chicago. Her doctorate was awarded in 1913, following her discovery of a new plant, Thismia americana. At the time, she was 24, the youngest person to receive a Ph. D. from the university.
        After teaching botany at the Unversity of North Dakota for 10 years, she joined the staff of the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research in Yonkers, now part of Cornell University. There she developed several hybrid lilies. She retired in 1959.
        Dr. Pfeiffer is survived by a sister, Marcella Wood.
