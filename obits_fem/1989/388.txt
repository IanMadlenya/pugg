        Aileen Pringle, a leading woman in more than 60 movies, most of them silent, and a personification of the exotic siren of the 1920's, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 94 years old.
        Two popular romances starring the petite actress with dark brown hair and green eyes were ''Three Weeks'' and ''His Hour,'' two 1924 silents based on scripts by Elinor Glyn, a Hollywood arbiter of the flapper era.
        Miss Pringle's leading men included John Gilbert, in flirtatious adventures, and Lew Cody, in domestic farces. Among her movies were ''Souls for Sale'' (1923), ''Wife of the Centaur'' (1924), ''A Kiss in the Dark'' (1925), ''Soul Mates'' (1926), ''Adam and Evil'' (1927), ''Beau Broadway'' (1928) and ''Puttin' on the Ritz'' (1930).
        She was born Aileen Bisbee in San Francisco, the daughter of George W. Bisbee, the president of the Pioneer Fruit Company, and was educated in private schools in Paris and London, where she went on the stage in 1915. She soon appeared on Broadway and began making silent films in 1919. Nearly a decade later, she adjusted well to talkies, but the films were minor, her roles shrank and she retired in 1939.
        The actress had been married to Charles McK. Pringle, the son of a former governor of Jamaica, and to the novelist James M. Cain. Both marriages ended in divorce. There are no immediate survivors.
