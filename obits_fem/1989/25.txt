        Dr. Catharine Deaver Lealtad, a pediatrician who supervised medical services for displaced children in Germany at the end of World War II, died Monday at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Brooklyn. She was 93 years old and had been a patient at the V.A.'s extended care center in St. Albans, Queens, for nine years.
        Dr. Lealtad, a native of St. Paul, was the first black graduate of Macalester College there. After teaching school in Columbus, Ohio, and working for the Young Women's Christian Association and the Urban League in New York, she was accepted at Cornell University Medical School but left, she said later, because of racial prejudice.
        After six years of medical study in Lyons, France, and Berlin, Dr. Lealtad interned in Chicago and practiced at clinics for infants in Harlem. In 1945 she was commissioned a major in the Army and sent to Germany. The following year she was flown to the interior of Shantung Province in China to assist doctors there in fighting cholera behind the front lines in the civil war.
        Returning to New York, Dr. Lealtad joined the pediatric service at Sydenham Hospital in Harlem. She later worked at a mission hospital in Puerto Rico and spent seven years as a volunteer at a clinic in Mexico City.
        Dr. Lealtad is survived by two sisters, Grace Lealtad of Pasadena, Calif., and Mary Hamilton of Chicago.
