        Bessie Griffin, a gospel singer, died of cancer yesterday at Brockton Memorial Center in Culver City, Calif. She was 67 years old and lived in Los Angeles.
        Miss Griffin was born in New Orleans, and grew up singing in church. She developed a powerful contralto style that was compared to that of Mahalia Jackson and Bessie Smith.
        In New Orleans, Miss Griffin worked with the Southern Harps, a group that also included Linda Hopkins. She joined the Caravans, a leading Chicago gospel group, in 1953, and she founded the Gospel Pearls in Los Angeles in the late 1950's. That group was one of the first to perform in the secular world of nightclubs and television, appearing frequently in the early 1960's on programs like ''Hootenanny'' and the ''Ed Sullivan Show.'' Miss Griffin recorded by Columbia, Decca, Epic, Savoy and Specialty Records.
        In recent years, Miss Griffin toured as a soloist, singing at jazz festivals as well as churches. Her last recording session took place in 1987. It is to be released along with vintage material on the album ''Even Me,'' on the Spirit Feel Records label.
        Miss Griffin is survived by her husband, Spencer Jackson.
