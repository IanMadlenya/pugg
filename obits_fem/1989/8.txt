Another of her novels, ''Affairs of the Heart,'' about the relations between blacks and whites in a Georgia town, was published in 1953.
        Mrs. Leonard began her newspaper career on The Macon Telegraph in 1929 and later was a reporter and editor at The Chattanooga News and The Louisville Courier and Times.
        She is survived by two daughters, Margaret, of Tallahassee, and Catherine, who is with the State Department in Ndjamena, Chad, and by two grandchildren.
