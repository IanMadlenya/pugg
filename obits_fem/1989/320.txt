        As Soviet troops fought their way into Warsaw in 1945, she carried messages through Warsaw's sewer system and cellars of the capital. After the war, she earned a degree in art history and archeology from the University of London.
        She is survived by her husband, Richard Noyes Viets, an American diplomat; three daughters, Alexandra, of Manhattan and Katrina and Marynka of Middleburg, and by a son from a previous marriage, Mark Grabowski of Baltimore.
