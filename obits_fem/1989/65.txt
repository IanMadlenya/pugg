        Mrs. Martus, who was born in Manhattan, graduated from Hunter College. She became coordinator of the School and Theater Committee of the New York City Association of Teachers of English, and later was an assistant to the president of the City Board of Education.
        In those jobs, she acted as a liaison with Broadway theater owners, inaugurating low-priced admissions for high school students. Mrs. Martus held the posts from 1935 to 1970, when she retired. Subsequently, she worked at City Center Theater, coordinating tickets for students.
        Surviving are her daughter, Babette Cole of Brooklyn; two sisters, Mary Shapiro of Manhattan and Frances Goodman of Hawthorne, N.J.; a brother, Sidney Davidoff, of Queens, and a granddaughter.
