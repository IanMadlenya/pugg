        Emily Davie Kornfeld, an author and actress, died of emphysema Friday at her home in Tuxedo Park, N.Y. She was 73 years old.
        Mrs. Kornfeld was the author of ''Profile of America,'' published in 1954 by Thomas Y. Crowell Company. The book, an illustrated history of the United States, was a compilation of writing by Americans like Thoreau and Jefferson. It was critically acclaimed and a best seller.
        But Congress refused to appropriate money for the United States Information Agency to purchase the book for its libraries abroad after a House appropriations subcommittee objected to the work on the basis of pictures that showed a rural schoolhouse and a plain-looking schoolteacher.
        The action created a furor in newspapers and magazines. ''What kind of puerility is this?'' asked an editorial in The New York Times. ''Is Congress to pass on every book, to censor every publication?''
        The foreword to the book was written by Charles A. Lindbergh, and the introduction was by Louis Bromfield. Mrs. Kornfeld, who wrote the book before she was married, waived her royalties.
        Mrs. Kornfeld was a granddaughter of a founder of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey. She was born in Tuxedo Park, graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and appeared on the stage on Broadway and at the Old Vic in London.
        She was predeceased by her husband, Joseph S. Kornfeld. In 1978, she established a foundation in the name of her husband and herself, which awards grants in medical research and related fields. Mrs. Kornfeld was the founder of the Tuxedo Historical Society.
        She had no survivors.
