        Sonja Haas, a Belgian-born lawyer who worked to win reparations for concentration camp survivors from the post-war German Government, died Sunday after a long illness. She was 79 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mrs. Haas and her husband had been active in the French Resistance in World War II and were arrested by the Gestapo and sent to separate German concentration camps for the duration of the war.
        After the war, the couple reunited and made their way to the United States. She became a citizen in 1955 and devoted her energies to forging a reparations agreement, which was completed in the mid-1960's.
        She is survived by her husband, Dr. Albert Haas, retired professor of experimental rehabilitation medicine at New York University; a son, Dr. Francois of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
