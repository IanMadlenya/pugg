        Helen Halik Beebe, a teacher of deaf children who was a noted speech pathologist, died of heart failure Saturday at Easton Hospital in Pennsylvania. She was 80 years old and lived in Easton.
        Mrs. Beebe graduated from the training program of the Clarke School for the Deaf in Northampton, Mass. She taught children until last year, using the ''auditory-verbal'' method, in which the residual hearing of the deaf aids in speech development.
        She founded a clinic, now the Helen Beebe Speech and Hearing Center, in Easton, more than 40 years ago.
        She was a former board member of the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf, which gave her its highest award; a former president of Auditory-Visual International and a former board member of the Foundation for Children's Hearing, Education and Research.
        Mrs. Beebe, a native of Hellertown, Mass., is survived by a brother, Charles E. Hulik, of Hancock, N.H., and a sister, Mary Eliassen, of Palo Alto, Calif.
        Correction:  March 30, 1989, Thursday, Late City Final Edition
        An obituary March 22 about Helen H. Beebe of Easton, Pa., a teacher of the deaf, gave her maiden name incorrectly. It was Hulick, not Halik.
