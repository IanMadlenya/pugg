        Beatrice Swancutt Wright Fuerst, former assistant director of women's activities for the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, died of natural causes Wednesday at Northern Dutchess Hospital in Rhinebeck, N.Y. She was 83 years old and lived in Rhinebeck.
        Mrs. Fuerst joined the foundation in 1946. In 1949 she contracted polio, from which she later recovered. R. K. Merton's 1968 book, ''On the Shoulders of Giants: the Bea Wright Story,'' published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, was based on her case. She retired in 1971.
        She is survived by her husband, Myron M. Fuerst; three sons from an earlier marriage, Harris Haertel of Seattle, Richard Haertel of Plymouth, Mich., and Thomas Haertel of Kamloops, Canada; two brothers, Woodrow Swancutt of San Antonio, Tex., and Vernon Swancutt of La Crosse, Wis., eight grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.

        An obituary on Saturday about Beatrice S. W. Fuerst misidentified a book about her battle against polio.
        Published in 1960 by the Chilton Company, it was titled ''On the Shoulders of Giants: the Bea Wright Story'' and was written by Eleanor Chappell. A 1965 book entitled ''On the Shoulders of Giants: A Shandean Postscript,'' written by Robert K. Merton and published by Harcourt Brace, is an unrelated scholarly work.
