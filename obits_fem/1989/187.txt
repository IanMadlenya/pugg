        Mrs. Jones, a native of Cambridge, Mass., joined the company in 1933 as a trainee. She retired as senior vice president in 1974, after overseeing the bank's move to the World Trade Center.
        Mrs. Jones was a director of the Dreyfus Third Century Fund, an investment fund, and a trustee of the North Salem Free Library. She had been a member and chairman of the North Salem Planning Board.
        She graduated from Bryn Mawr cum laude in 1928 and was a member of the Bryn Mawr board of directors since 1951. In 1930 she was hired by Margaret Sanger to become executive director of the National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control.
        Her husband, Russell K. Jones, retired vice president of the now-defunct advertising agency Cunningham & Walsh, died in 1986. She is survived by two sisters, Mary Gregory and Jeanette Barker, both of Jaffrey, N.H.
