        Mrs. Salomons founded the company in Berlin in 1923, moved to Paris in 1933, went to southern France and Morocco in the early 1940's and then came to the United States. She was active in the company until 1985.
        Her survivors include a son, Stefan Wolff of Gambier, Ohio; two stepsons, Jean-Pierre Aumont, an actor, and Francois Villiers, a film maker, both of Paris; 13 grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.
