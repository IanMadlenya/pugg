        Dr. Greenbaum, who was born in Lipkany, Rumania, received her medical degree from the University of Paris in 1935, and was an intern at the Hospital Neufmoutiers-en-Brie. Shortly after the Germans invaded France, she fled to Morocco and eventually came to the United States.
        She did her residency at Bellevue Psychiatric Hospital in Manhattan and was a clinical psychiatrist there from 1954 to 1956. She then began teaching at New York University School of Medicine and later at New York Medical College. During that time she also taught at Bellevue. In addition, she had a private practice and wrote articles for professional journals.
        She is survived by her husband, Dr. Henry; a daughter, Anita Greenbaum-Brush of Auburndale, Mass.; a sister, Tzili Mandeli of Haifa, Israel, and two grandchildren.
