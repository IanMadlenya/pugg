        Gisele Blankstein Birnbaum, an immigration lawyer for the International Rescue Committee in Manhattan, died of a heart attack Tuesday at Doctor's Hospital. She was 79 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mrs. Birnbaum joined the International Rescue Committee in 1967 as a volunteer expert in refugee law and over the years helped thousands of refugees and their families obtain asylum in the United States.
        She was born in Antwerp and received a doctorate in international law from the University of Brussels in 1932 and was accredited to the International Court in The Hague. She came to the United States in 1940, when the Nazis invaded Belgium, with her American husband, Sylvain, a diamond merchant, and their infant daughter. Her husband died in 1968.  She is survived by her daughter, Anne-Marie Levine of Manhattan; a sister, Dr. Francine Schwarzkopf, also of Manhattan, and a grandson.
