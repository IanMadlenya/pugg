        May Garelick McClintock, an author and editor of children's books, died of cancer Wednesday at the Village Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 84 years old.
        Mrs. McClintock, who wrote under the name May Garelick, was born in Russia and brought to the United States when she was nine months old. She was educated in the New York City public schools and in the early 1950's joined the children's book publishers William R. Scott.
        She had a long career in positions ranging from clerical worker to production manager and editor. As an editor, she identified and developed new talent and helped publish the early work of Maurice Sendak, Miriam Schlein, Leonard Kessler and Barbara Brenner.
        She wrote more than a dozen children's books, mostly in answer to questions posed to her by a child. ''Where Does the Butterfly Go When It Rains?'', published in 1961 by W. R. Scott, was one of her most popular. Other titles included ''What's Inside?,'' ''What Makes a Bird a Bird?,'' ''Manhattan Island,'' ''Double Trouble,'' ''About Owls,'' ''Two Orphan Cubs'' and ''Down to the Beach.'' Her latest book, ''Just My Size,'' is scheduled to be published in 1990 by Harper & Row.
        There are no immediate survivors.
