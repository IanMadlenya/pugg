        Mrs. Kahn's father, Harry Abraham, founded the company in 1914, and she began working for it after his death in 1949. When her mother Gussie, who had been running the factory, died in 1974, Mrs. Kahn operated it until 1982, when she sold it and retired.
        Mrs. Kahn was active in civic affairs and was co-founder of the Great Neck Cooperative Nursery School in the early 1930's.
        She is survived by her husband, Jesse; two sons, David, of Great Neck, and Louis, of Teaneck, N.J.; a daughter, Miriam Harris of Great Neck; seven grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
