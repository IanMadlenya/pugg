        Josette Frank, an authority on books for children and a consultant on children's programming for radio and television, died of pneumonia Saturday at a nursing home in Alexandria, Va., where she lived. She was 96 years old.
        Miss Frank, a native New Yorker, was for many years the director of children's books and mass media for the Child Study Association of America. She also served on the book-selection committees of the National Conference of Christians and Jews and the National Committee for Program Services of the Campfire Girls.
        In her books and in public appearances, Miss Frank offered parents advice on how to plan children's reading. Her research into what children read led to a list of recommended books for a variety of ages and interests.
        Miss Frank was the author of, among other books, ''Your Child's Reading Today,'' published by Doubleday in 1954.
        She is survived by a daughter, Judith Rosen of Alexandria; a son, Steven Jacobs of Tucson, Ariz., and nine grandchildren.
