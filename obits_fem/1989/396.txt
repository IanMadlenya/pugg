        Nancy W. Green, a theater producer and television casting director, died of a heart attack on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 72 years old.
        Mrs. Green produced plays in the late 1940's to the 1960's, and helped found such theater companies as the the New Parsons Theater in Hartford, the New Dramatists in Manhattan and Theater Inc. in Manhattan, which became the Phoenix Theater.
        Theater Inc. was established to present revivals, experimental works and productions from abroad, and its shows included ''The Old Vic,'' starring Laurence Olivier and Ralph Richardson, and ''The Playboy of the Western World,'' starring Burgess Meredith.
        She worked with a theater-and-film production company called Play-Pix, which produced the film ''Georgy Girl.'' She also served on the board of John Houseman's troupe, the Acting Company, in Manhattan. She was also the executive casting director for the Daytime Emmy Awards ceremony in the 1970's and early 1980's.
        Mrs. Green studied at the Moscow Art Theater Lab School, and began her career working in radio and advertising before producing shows for the U.S.O. in World War II. She also worked for the movie producer David O. Selznick.
        She is survived by her husband, Jules L. Green of Manhattan; a son, Morley Anthony Stern of Los Angeles; a daughter, Susan Cookson of Southfield, Mass.; a stepson, Steven Green of Pembroke Pines, Fla., and eight grandchildren.
