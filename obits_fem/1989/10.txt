        Norma Varden, whose acting career in films, television and on the state included such roles as Jack Benny's mother and the housekeeper in ''The Sound of Music,'' has died at age 90.
        Miss Varden died Thursday of heart failure at Cottage Hospital's coronary care unit, a nurse, Kathy Polischuk, said today.
        Miss Varden began making movies in the early 1930's in her native England, which led to offers from Hollywood. Her credits there included ''Random Harvest,'' ''The White Cliffs of Dover,'' ''National Velvet'' and ''Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.''
        In addition to her ''Sound of Music'' role, she played the murder victim in ''Witness for the Prosecution.'' In the Humphrey Bogart-Ingrid Bergman classic ''Casablanca,'' she was the woman whose husband's pocket was picked.
        Turning to television, Miss Varden was Mr. Benny's mother on ''The Jack Benny Show'' in the 1950's.
        She had made her home in this coastal city northwest of Los Angeles since 1969. Funeral arrangements were incomplete, a spokesman for the Wech-Ryce-Haider Funeral Chapel said.
