        Glenna Collett Vare, a pioneer in American women's golf before the professional era and a charter member of the Women's Golf Hall of Fame, died at her home in Gulfstream, Fla., on Friday. She was 85 years old.
        Mrs. Vare won the United States women's national title six times between 1922 and 1935, including three years in a row from 1928 through 1930. She was part of what was known as the Big Four of women's golf in the 1920's and 1930's along with Virginia Van Wie, Maureen Orcutt and Helen Hicks.
        Born in New Haven, she won her first match at the age of 14. Trophy Named for Her
        Mrs. Vare, who was remembered for her long drives and speedy play, never turned professional. But the Vare Trophy, given annually by the Ladies Professional Golfers Association to the player with the lowest average on the tour, is named after her.
        Mrs. Vare was one of the first Americans to play in the British amateur championships and was runner-up in 1929 and 1930. She won the Canadian championship in 1923 and 1924.
        She was instrumental in re-instituting the Curtis Cup competition between the United States and Britain after a one-year lapse, taking a group of eight Americans to England in 1930, shortly after her marriage to Edwin H. Vare Jr. She had not been active in the sport since finishing runner-up to Miss Orcutt in the United States Golf Association's seniors event in 1962.
        In 1950, Mrs. Vare was one of six women selected as charter members of the Hall of Fame.
        She is survived by a son, Edwin Collett Vare of New Haven; a daughter, Glenna Kalen of Caracas, Venezuela, and a brother, Edwin A. Collett of Brewster, Mass.
