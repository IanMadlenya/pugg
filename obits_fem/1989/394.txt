        Dr. Priscilla White, whose research sharply increased the survival rate of babies born to diabetic women, died Saturday at her home here. She was 89 years old.
        A statement from the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston said Dr. White found that a fetus of a diabetic mother would often be healthy a month before delivery but would die if allowed to go to full term. She concluded that babies of diabetic women should be delivered early.
        She also found that although infants of diabetic mothers usually are normal or larger than normal in size despite premature birth they require the same special care needed for premature infants.
        Dr. White's research and the treatment process she developed increased the fetal survival rate around the country from 54 percent in the 1920's to about 97 percent in the late 1970's and 1980's, the center said.
        Born in Boston, Dr. White attended Radcliffe College and graduated third in her class from Tufts University Medical School in 1923.
        She joined a diabetes practice headed by Elliott P. Joslin, and in 1924 became the youngest member of the team that established the Joslin center.
        Dr. White taught at Harvard Medical School and was an assistant professor of medicine at Tufts. She received numerous honors and was the first woman to receive the Banting Medal, the American Diabetes Association's highest scientific award.
