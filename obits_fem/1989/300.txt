        Dr. Pearl (Perry) Izenzon, the co-founder and executive director of the Potsmokers Anonymous drug-rehabilitation program, died of cancer Friday night at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 48 years old and lived on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.
        Dr. Izenzon founded the rehabilitation program in 1974 with her husband, David Izenzon, an artist and musician who died of a heart attack in 1977. Dr. Izenzon, who had a doctorate in education, was also an artist.
        The Izenzons modeled Potsmokers Anonymous after Alcoholics Anonymous. Thousands of marijuana smokers were helped by the program, said a longtime family friend, Richard Weiner. He added that Dr. Izenzon did not use drugs, and that she helped start the program because many of her musician and artist friends were battling drug problems.
        He also said she made many radio and television appearances warning about the dangers of drug abuse. ''She felt that pot was not something to be taken lightly,'' Mr. Weiner said.
        Dr. Izenzon received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Bard College in 1951 and her doctorate from Columbia University Teachers College in 1986.
        A native of Queens, she was active in many community rehabilitation and beautification projects on the Lower East Side.
        She is survived by two sons, Solomon and Seth, both of Manhattan, and a sister, Goldy Rosen, of Garden City, L.I. Her mother, Fannie Meresman, of Manhattan, died two weeks ago.
