        In 1922, Mrs. Macfarlane became the second person to earn a doctoral degree in psychology at Berkeley. She founded the school's Institute of Human Development, originally called the Institute of Child Welfare, in 1927.
        In 1928 she inaugurated the Guidance Study, a lifelong study of 250 individuals born that year that still continues. It provided a body of information on normal personality development. Until then psychology had been dominated by theories based on pathological personalities.
        She was a former president of the California Psychological Association, and winner of the American Psychological Association's highest honor in developmental psychology.
        There are no immediate survivors.
