        Dr. Robinson joined the Dartmouth faculty at the age of 27. In 1973 she was the first woman on the faculty of arts and sciences to be appointed the Gross Taylor/Cornelia Pierce Williams Assistant Professor of Biology.
        While continuing research at the college, she received an M.D. in 1978 from the Dartmouth Medical School and began a residency in maternal and child health at Mary Hitchcok Hospital in Hanover. Illness forced her to retire in 1979.
        She was an honors graduate of Bryn Mawr College in 1966 and held a Ph.D in biology from Yale University. She then became a post-doctoral fellow at Georgetown University.
        Dr. Robinson is survived by her parents, Franklin and Gloria Robinson, and a sister, Dorothy, all of New Haven; a brother, Geoffrey of Leverett, Mass.; and her maternal grandmother, Edna R. Kurzrok of Manhattan.
