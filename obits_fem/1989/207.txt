        Kyriena Siloti, a piano teacher who was the daughter of the pianist and conductor Alexander Siloti, died of a heart attack at New York Hospital on Friday. She was 94 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Miss Siloti taught at the New School in Cambridge, Mass., until last October, when she had a stroke. She also taught privately at her home in New York, where her students included Eugene Istomin.
        She was born in Antwerp, Belgium, in 1895, and studied the piano with her mother, Vera Tretyakova, who had been a student of Rimsky-Korsakov, and her father, who had been a student of Liszt. She also studied composition with Aleksandr Glazunov at the Imperial Conservatory in St. Petersberg.
        Miss Siloti, who moved to New York in 1927, did not pursue a performing career, but her teaching was regarded as an important link with the tradition of 19th-century Russian pianism.
