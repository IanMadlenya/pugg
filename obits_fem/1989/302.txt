        An obituary on Tuesday about Irma A. Bloomingdale listed some of her survivors incorrectly. Joseph and Lewis Bloomingdale, both of Scarsdale, N.Y., are her sons, not her brothers. In addition to her daughters Laura Goeldlin and Beatrice Steinhaus, survivors include a third daughter, Elinor B. Preis of Rancho Bernardo, Calif.
