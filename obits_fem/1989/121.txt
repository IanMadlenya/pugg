        Ms. Brown was prominent in the underground performance world of the 1960's and 70's, appearing frequently at such New York nightclubs as Reno Sweeney's, S.N.A.F.U. and the Continental Baths, and acting in such experimental films as ''Brand X,'' ''The Illiac Passion'' and several early works by Andy Warhol.
        A short, stout singer with wild black hair, Ms. Brown was known for her intense, dramatic renditions of songs by Kurt Weill, the Rolling Stones and David Bowie. She also appeared in Broadway and Off Broadway productions of ''Mame,'' ''The Pajama Game,'' ''Medea'' and other works. In 1951, Ms. Brown was a founder of the Fine Arts Conservatory, in Miami, which was one of the first racially integrated theaters and art schools in the South. She was the subject of ''Tally Brown, New York,'' an award-winning 1980 documentary by Rosa von Praunheim.
