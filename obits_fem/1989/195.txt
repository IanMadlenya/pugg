        Dayal Kaur Khalsa, an author and illustrator of children's books, died of breast cancer Monday at her home in Vancouver, British Columbia. She was 46 years old.
        Ms. Kaur Kalsa, who adopted the Sikh religion in the early 1970's, wrote several books that received critical acclaim for their evocation of childhood.
        ''Tales of a Gambling Grandma,'' published in 1986, recounted the fanciful stories she was told by her Russian-born grandmother. ''I Want a Dog'' (1987), ''Sleepers'' (1988) and ''How Pizza Came to Queens'' as well as other books, all published by Clarkson N. Potter, also drew heavily on memories of childhood. Two works completed before her death will be published this fall and next spring.
        Ms. Kaur Khalsa was born in Queens and was a graduate of City College of New York.
        She is survived by a brother, Louis Schoenfeld, of New York City.
