        Brooke Michele Ward, the first bone marrow recipient to be matched with a donor through a national registry, died Saturday, exactly two years after receiving the transplant in Seattle. She was 8 years old.
        Brooke, who had leukemia, died in her father's arms on the way to Rex Hospital here, said her parents, Margurite and Michael Ward.
        Mrs. Ward said her daughter's leukemia prognosis had been good, but Brooke continued to be afflicted with a condition in which the body rejects the transplanted marrow. Dr. Randy Hedgepeth, who cared for Brooke, said that condition caused her death.
        Her operation on Dec. 16, 1987, at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle was the first transplant in which marrow was located from the National Bone Marrow Donor Registry.
        Brooke met her donor, Diane Walters, 50, of Milwaukee last March, moments before they appeared live on ABC-TV's ''Good Morning America.'' They had become friends through letters and telephone calls.
        Brooke is survived by her parents; brothers Jeffrey Michael Ward of Pembroke Pines, Fla., and Jerry Lee Ward of Raleigh; maternal grandfather, C. E. Wheeler of Raleigh; and paternal grandfather, L. A. Ward of Everett, Wash.
