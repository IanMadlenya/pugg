        Beth Slingerland, a widely known educator in the field of dyslexia, died Wednesday at the Judson Park Retirement Home in Seattle. She was 89 years old.
        Mrs. Slingerland developed a classroom adaptation of the Orton-Gillingham system for teaching dyslexic children, whose abilty to read is impaired. She became interested in the problem while at the Punahou School in Hawaii, where she was director of the lower school from 1938 to 1945.
        In the late 1940's she moved to the Renton, Wash., school district, where she worked as a coordinator of a language disability program until 1965. In 1977 she founded the Slingerland Institute in Bellevue, Wash., which now trains 600 teachers in the United States and Canada and this year opened a training program in Australia.
        She is survived by her husband, John Slingerland.
