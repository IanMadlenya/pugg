        Ms. West came to Manhattan in 1929 from Michigan, where she had attended the University of Michigan and Antioch College. She worked for a number of advertising agencies, including J. Walter Thompson, and department stores, including Bamberger's in Newark. She was the advertising manager of Saks Fifth Avenue in the early 1940's and a vice president for the C. J. LaRoche agency in the 1950's. She retired in 1965 to devote herself to writing.
        She published her first book ''Stop Dieting! Start Losing!'' (E. P. Dutton), a collection of ''decalorized recipes,'' in 1956. Her other books include ''The Teen-Age Diet Book'' (Julian Messner, 1957). In 1972, she assisted Dr. Robert C. Atkins in writing ''Dr. Atkins' Diet Revolution'' (McKay), one of the all-time mass-market best sellers, according to Publisher's Weekly.
        Ms. West is survived by a daughter, Piri Halasz of Manhattan; three stepsons, and a stepdaughter.
