        From 1957 to 1985, Mrs. Saito maintained a restaurant, Saito, first on West 55th Street and later on East 46th Street. In 1985 she returned to Japan, where she had established another Saito.
        She was a familiar figure in the New York restaurant, dressed in traditional costume and supervising the service. She also cut a dashing figure in other restaurants, bejeweled and fur clad, believing that restaurateurs should sample the cooking of other establishments.
        Mrs. Saito was born in Nagoya, Japan. She said she grew up in a geisha house and was trained in Kabuki dancing. In her restaurant, she continued the art of pleasing people, attempting to explain sushi and educate diners.
        A memorial is to be held July 28 at 6 P.M. at the Japanese American Association of New York at 7 West 44th street.
        There were no survivors.
