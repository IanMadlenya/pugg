        Ms. Glushien, a watercolor artist, was a former student of George Bridgman, Kuniyoshi and Mario Cooper. Her work was exhibited at a number of galleries, including the National Arts Club, the Kentucky Museum of Fine Arts and the American Institute of Architects. She was a founder and treasurer of the Sumi-e Society of America, devoted to Japanese ink painting, and had been associated with the Frick Collection and Columbia Pictures.
        During World War II, she translated ''The Real Jazz,'' an early jazz anthology by the French critic Hugues Panassie, working from a water-soaked manuscript smuggled out of France. She was also active as a photographer and was a former photography editor of Collier's magazine.
        Ms. Glushien is survived by her husband, Morris; two daughters, Minna Taylor, of Los Angeles, and Ruth Wedgwood, of Darien, Conn., and a granddaughter.
