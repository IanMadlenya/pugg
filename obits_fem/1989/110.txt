        Norma Klein, an author of more than 30 novels for teen-agers and adults, died Tuesday after a brief illness at St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 50 years old.
        Ms. Klein was best known for young-adult works that dealt with family problems, childhood and adolescent sexuality, as well as social issues like racism, sexism and contraception. Her first novel, ''Mom, the Wolf Man and Me'' (1972), was about the daughter of an unmarried, sexually active woman. Ms. Klein's subsequent works, which were published by Alfred A. Knopf, Viking, Fawcett, Dutton, Dial and Bantam, included ''Taking Sides,'' ''What It's All About,'' ''Angel Face'' and ''Going Backwards.'' She frequently published two or three books a year, and most were very successful, according to Frances Foster, her editor at Knopf.
        Because of their subject matter, many of Ms. Klein's books sparked considerable controversy, and a 1986 American Library Association survey found that nine of her novels had been removed from libraries. In a 1986 interview with The New York Times, Ms. Klein said: ''I'm not a rebel, trying to stir things up just to be provocative. I'm doing it because I feel like writing about real life.''
        Ms. Klein's adult fiction focused on contemporary couples and families, and her novels included ''American Dreams'' and ''The World As It Is.'' She also published about 60 short stories, taught fiction at Yale and Wesleyan Universities, and was a board member of PEN.
        Ms. Klein is survived by her husband, Erwin Fleissner; two daughters, Jennifer and Katherine; her brother, Victor; and her mother, Sadie, all of Manhattan.
