        Dr. Eleanor J. Farrar, an educator, author and education researcher, died of cancer Sunday at her home in Shaker Heights, Ohio. She was 50 years old.
        Dr. Farrar helped shape the debate over improving public education with her writings, particularly her best-known work, ''The Shopping Mall High School,'' a book she wrote with Arthur G. Powell and David K. Cohen in 1985.
        She was an associate professor of education at the State University of New York at Buffalo since 1986 and was also engaged in a long-term study of the effects of a business-education partnership intended to revamp the public schools in Boston and improve the college and job prospects of graduates.
        She received her Ph.D. in education at Harvard University.
        She is survived by her husband, Jay Talbott, of Shaker Heights; her son, Jeffrey Farrar, of Kitty Hawk, N.C., and her mother, Alice Farrar, of Nashua, N.H.
