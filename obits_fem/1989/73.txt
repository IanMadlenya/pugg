        Lynn Ceci, an anthropologist and a professor at Queens College and at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, died of liver cancer yesterday at her home in Locust Valley, L.I. She was 58 years old.
        Dr. Ceci, a graduate of City University, earned her Ph.D. in 1977. She joined the faculty at Queens College in 1978 and began teaching at the Graduate Center in 1987.
        She was an expert on wampum, beads made from mollusk shells and used as money by American Indians in the beaver trade. In her doctoral dissertation she showed how the British ended Dutch dominance of the fur trade by capturing the Pequot Indian wampum makers.
        She is survived by her husband, Joseph; a daughter, Christine Bagley of Hampton, Va.; two sons, Vincent, of Minneapolis, and Timothy, of Chicago, and four grandchildren.
