        Mrs. Wolberg and her late husband. Dr. Lewis R. Wolberg, were co-founders of the Postgraduate Center for Mental Health in Manhattan in 1945. She was considered an authority on the treatment of patients with borderline personality disorders and wrote two books on the subject, ''The Psychoanalytic Treatment of the Borderline Patient in the Individual and Group Setting'' published in 1960 by Karger, Basel, and ''The Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy of the Borderline Patient,'' published in 1982 by Thieme-Stratton.
        Mrs. Wolberg received a master's degree in social science from Smith College School of Social Work in 1930 and a certificate in psychotherapy and psychoanalysis at the Postgraduate Center in 1952. She had been director of community services and dean of community service and education since 1959.
        She is survived by two daughters, Barbara Jane Hamburger and Ellen May Baumwoll, both of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.
