        Beatrice Rosenberg, a lawyer who held high positions in the Federal Government and argued more than 30 cases before the Supreme Court, died of a heart attack Wednesday at Holy Cross Hospital in Silver Spring, Md. She was 81 years old and had moved to Silver Spring from Washington two years ago.
        Ms. Rosenberg headed the appellate litigation section of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission when she retired in 1979. She joined the commission in 1972 after 29 years at the Justice Department, where she often appeared before the High Court as chief of the appellate section in the Criminal Division.
        At the Justice Department, she helped draft a bill on crime for the District of Columbia known for its provisions for preventive detention and ''no knock'' searches.
        Largely unknown outside Government circles, she was highly respected within them, and was reported to be under consideration for a Supreme Court nomination in the Nixon Administration.
        In 1970 she was the first woman to receive the Tom C. Clark Award for outstanding government service by a lawyer. After retirement she became a volunteer mediator in a dispute resolution program in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and a member of a legal disciplinary board of the District of Columbia's Court of Appeals.
        Ms. Rosenberg was born in Newark, where she was a high school classmate of William J. Brennan Jr., now a Supreme Court Justice. She was a graduate of Wellesley College and New York University Law School.
        She is survived by a brother, Dr. Albert A. Rosenberg of Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
