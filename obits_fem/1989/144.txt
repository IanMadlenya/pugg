        Karen Ulane, a Vietnam War combat pilot who was discharged by Eastern Airlines after a sex-change operation in 1980, was killed Monday in the crash of a charter plane. She was 48 years old and lived in Aurora.
        Ms. Ulane, known until her surgery as Kenneth Ulane, died in the crash of a twin-propeller DC-3 owned by an air taxi and cargo service in a field near here. Two others aboard were also killed.
        Ms. Ulane had the sex-change operation in 1980 after 12 years with Eastern. The airline dismissed her, citing possible safety hazards in stressful situations.
        In 1983 Federal District Judge John F. Grady ordered reinstatement and $158,590 in back pay and other expenses, saying the 1964 Federal anti-discrimination law protects transsexuals. An appeals court disagreed and reversed the decision.
        Ms. Ulane eventually received a settlement from Eastern that was ''substantially more'' than the amount ordered by Judge Grady, said her attorney, Dean Dickie.
        Kenneth Ulane flew combat missions in Vietnam from 1964 to 1968.
        Survivors include her mother and a son from a marriage while she was Kenneth Ulane.
