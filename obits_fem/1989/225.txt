        Roberta Worrick, who wrote under the pen name Maria Thomas, was among the eight Americans killed last Monday in the crash of the airplane carrying United States Representative Mickey Leland of Texas. She lived in Addis Ababa; her age could not be learned last night.
        Her husband, Tom, the deputy director of the United States Agency for International Development in Ethopia, was also killed in the crash.
        Mrs. Worrick's novel, ''Antonia Saw the Oryx First,'' published by SoHo Press and distributed by Farrar, Straus & Giroux in 1987, drew critical praise for its depiction of the tensions between colonial whites and Africans on a continent buffeted by changes.
        After the success of the novel, Soho Press issued ''Come to Africa and Save Your Marriage,'' Mrs. Worrick's collection of short stories in which she told of the difficulties of various people -Peace Corps volunteers, foreign academics, Indians, American blacks and white hunters left behind by colonial empires - in finding their way in black Africa.
        Mr. Worrick and her husband went to Africa with the Peace Corps in 1971 and stayed on, pursuing their own careers. In addition Ethiopia, they lived in Tanzania, Liberia, Nigeria and Kenya.
