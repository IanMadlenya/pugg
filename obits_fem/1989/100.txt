        Princess Dok Hye, the last princess of the Yi Dynasty, which ruled Korea for 500 years, until the Japanese annexation in 1910, died today, the state radio reported. She was 76 years old, and the cause of death was not announced.
        Reports said Princess Dok Hye was afflicted for years with aphasia, which leads to an inability to speak or understand others. The reports said her health had further deteriorated in recent months after she caught a cold.
        Princess Dok Hye, the daughter of King Kojong, was sent to Tokyo by the Japanese in 1925, at the age of 13. She married a Japanese and returned to Seoul in 1962.
        The Princess and her family lived in near obscurity in Seoul in the years after the Korean War. They were granted a small stipend and a small house on the outskirts of the city.
        King Kojong ruled Korea from 1864 to 1907, before he was forced to abdicate his throne in favor of a son as part of Japan's growing influence over the Korean peninsula.
        The state radio did not list Princess Dok Hye's survivors.
