On Broadway, she appeared in more than 40 productions from the 1920's to the 1970's, including ''Having Wonderful Time,'' ''Two on an Island,'' ''A New Life,'' ''Sailor, Beware,'' ''Counselor at Law,'' ''Burlesque'' and ''Dance me a Song.'' She also acted in about 10 films, including ''Duffy's Tavern'' (1945), and made frequent appearances on television variety shows in the 1950's and 1960's.
        Miss Thomas served on the Council of Actors Equity, and was a member of the national board of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. She also was known for her collection of more than 2,000 antique dolls.
