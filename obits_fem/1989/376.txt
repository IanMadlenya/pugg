        Louise Dahl-Wolfe, one of the nation's best-known fashion and portrait photographers, died of pneumonia on Monday at the Allendale (N.J.) Nursing Home. She was 94 years old.
        Mrs. Dahl-Wolfe spent much of her life working with a camera, documenting haute couture, photographing celebrities and helping define the postwar look of American women. During her years at Harper's Bazaar, from 1936 to 1958, she produced about 85 cover photographs, 600 color pages and many black-and-white shots. Her subjects ranged from celebrities like John F. Kennedy, Paul Robeson and Orson Welles to the famous models of the day. Her photograph of Lauren Bacall when she was a teen-ager caught the eye of the director Howard Hawks and led to Miss Bacall's film career. She also won acclaim for her photographs of Tennessee mountain women, which appeared in Vanity Fair in 1933.
        Mrs. Dahl-Wolfe studied at the San Francisco Institute of Art and was an interior decorator before taking up photography in 1920. In 1928, she married the sculptor Meyer Wolfe, who died in 1985. Her work was exhibited in the first photography show at the Museum of Modern Art in 1937, and she had many gallery shows in New York and elsewhere. Many of her photographs are in the collections of the Fashion Institute of Technology and such museums as the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Contemporary Photography in Chicago.
        Mrs. Dahl-Wolfe has no immediate survivors.
