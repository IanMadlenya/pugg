        Leonora Highet Messmore, a connoisseur of fine art and a needlepoint expert, died Thursday at her home in Southampton, L.I., after battling cancer for 23 years. She was 81 years old.
        For many years, Mrs. Messmore helped her husband, Carman, an art dealer, establish many notable collections of old masters. In 1947 Mr. Messmore persuaded Joan Whitney Payson to buy Van Gogh's ''Irises'' for $84,000. Forty years later Mrs. Payson's son, John Whitney Payson, sold the painting at Sotheby's in New York for $53.9 million - the highest price ever paid for an artwork at auction. Both Mr. Messmore and Mrs. Payson died in 1975.
        Mrs. Messmore designed and sold beaded cashmere sweaters for 20 years through her company, Messmore Originals. One of her projects, an 81-square-foot needlepoint rug, took her nine years to complete.
        Friends said she showed extraordinary courage in battling cancer for so many years. She was born in Sterling, Scotland, and grew up in England and Malaya, as Malaysia, a former British colony, was then known. In World War II she helped in many aid programs for Britain. She was a first-rate bridge player and winner of many croquet tournaments.
        Surviving are two stepdaughters, Ann Close of Rochester and Frances Rice of Fox Chapel, Pa.; a stepson, Carroll Robertson of Charleston, S.C.; four grandchildren, three nephews and a niece.
