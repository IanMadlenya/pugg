        Clae Rosengarten, a founder of one of the first professional symphony orchestras on Long Island and of the New York Youth Orchestra in Manhattan, died of colon cancer Wednesday at her home. She was 89 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mrs. Rosengarten, who was born Clae Peltz in New York, helped organize the Long Island Symphony Orchestra in the late 1930's. The symphony functioned for eight years. The New York Youth Orchestra, which she helped found in 1963, still performs.
        From 1956 through last year, Mrs. Rosengarten was on the board of directors of Fountain House, a halfway house that offered therapy and job counseling to patients recently released from mental hospitals.
        Her husband, Herbert, died in 1987. She is survived by a daughter, Johanna Garfield, and a son, Frank Rosengarten, both of Manhattan; a sister, Lillian Schuman, of Los Angeles, and six grandchildren.
