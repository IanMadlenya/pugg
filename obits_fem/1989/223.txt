        Margaret Batts Tobin, a longtime board member of the Metropolitan Opera, died of bone cancer last Thursday in San Antonio, her hometown. She was 91 years old.
        Mrs. Tobin helped found the San Antonio Symphony Society in 1939 and its opera series five years later. She was also a major supporter of the Santa Fe Opera and the Spoleto Festival in Italy.
        She was first elected to the Metropolitan Opera's board in 1969. Among the productions she underwrote for the Met were Britten's ''Peter Grimes'' in 1966, the Met's first production of Berg's ''Lulu'' in 1977, and most recently Gershwin's ''Porgy and Bess'' in 1985.
        She is survived by her son, Robert L. S. Tobin, of New York City.
