        Mattlyn Gavers, a former ballet mistress of the Metropolitan Opera and a professor of ballet at the University of Utah, died of emphysema on Aug. 19 in Salt Lake City. She was 75 years old.
        She was born Mattlyn B. Gevurtz in Portland, Ore., and studied ballet there with Willam Christensen, who was invited to teach at the San Francisco Ballet in 1937; a year later, he became the company's director. Miss Gavers followed her teacher to San Francisco, dancing with the company from 1937 to 1949. In 1950, she began a 15-year association with the Metropolitan Opera Ballet in New York, serving first as assistant to Antony Tudor, its director at the time; she was appointed ballet mistress in 1955. While in New York, she also taught at the Juilliard School.
        For the Met, she staged the dance sequences in such operas as ''Turandot,'' ''La Sonnambula,'' ''La Traviata'' and ''Die Meistersinger.'' She also choreographed the Little Orchestra Society's production of George Kleinsinger's opera ''The Swallow and the Prince'' in 1950. After leaving the Met, she served as assistant ballet director of the Vienna State Opera for two years.
        Joining the faculty of the University of Utah in 1969, she worked once again with Mr. Christensen, the founder of the university's ballet department.
        She retired this year and at her death had the title Professor Emeritus. She was also at various times guest teacher at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, the San Francisco Ballet School and the Indiana University campus at Bloomington.
