        Mrs. Slater was the youngest of four children of Leonid Pasternak, a Russian Impressionist painter who was once commissioned by Leo Tolstoy to illustrate one of his books. Her mother, Rosalia, was a concert pianist.
        After her marriage in 1936 to a British psychiatrist, Dr. Eliot Slater, she moved to London from Germany. Her parents followed her to England to escape anti-Semitism. In Oxford, she wrote poetry and worked as a translator.
        Mrs. Slater is survived by two sons and two daughters.
