        Miss Vinton auditioned successfully for the ''Follies'' at age 13 and portrayed ''The Kid'' opposite W. C. Fields. She performed with the ''Follies'' - lavish annual revues produced by Florenz Ziegfeld - throughout most of the 1920's.
        She performed as a comedian in Broadway musicals, including ''Luckee Girl,'' ''The Manhatters,'' ''Merry Go Round'' and ''Say When.'' She later worked in public relations. For 17 years she was president of the National Ziegfeld Club, offering assistance to needy women in show business. There are no known survivors.  Funeral services are to be held tomorrow at 8:30 P.M. at the Walter B. Cooke Funeral Chapel, 1504 Third Avenue, at 85th Street.
