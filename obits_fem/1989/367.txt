The order, which has 1,400 nuns of about 60 nationalities on five continents, is devoted to the contemplative life. Its members share the poverty and social conditions of manual laborers in slums and shantytowns around the world. She wrote two works, ''From One End of the Earth to the Other,'' and ''From the Sahara to the Whole World.''
