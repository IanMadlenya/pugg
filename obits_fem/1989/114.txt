        Maria Balducci, a founder of Balducci's, the well-known family grocery store in Greenwich Village, died of complications from a stroke Monday at her home in Queens. She was 89 years old.
        Born in Corato, Italy, Mrs. Balducci came to the United States in 1939. With her husband, Louis, she worked in the family's first store on Greenwich Avenue, opened in 1946. When the store moved to its present site at 424 Avenue of the Americas, at West Ninth Street, Mrs. Balducci began cooking the rustic dishes of her native province of Bari.
        As the store expanded, Mrs. Balducci's kitchen also grew. Now it is the centerpiece of the store, offering a large range of Italian-inspired foods. Until Mrs. Balducci became ill last year, she oversaw the kitchen, working six days a week.
        Mr. Balducci died last August. Mrs. Balducci is survived by two sons, Charles, of Malverne, L.I., and Andrew, of East Williston, L.I.; a daughter, Grace Doria of Queens; a brother, Ricardo Miscioscia of Naples; 17 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
