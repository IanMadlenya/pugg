        Joan Woodbury, an actress who starred in dozens of low-budget films, died of respiratory failure on Wednesday. She was 73 years old.
        Miss Woodbury appeared in her first film, ''Eight Girls in a Boat,'' in 1933 and went on to play a wide range of roles, becoming known as Hollywood's leading lady of B movies. In 1945 she played the title role in a serialization of the ''Brenda Starr'' comic strip.
        Miss Woodbury retired from films in 1963 and that year helped found the Valley Players Guild in Palm Springs, where she worked in more than 120 productions over 25 years.
