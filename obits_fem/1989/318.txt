        Ms. Friedman, a native New Yorker, began her career as a union organizer when she was a student at City College. After graduation, she became a legal secretary in an assemblyman's office in which Paul O'Dwyer was a clerk. When Mr. O'Dwyer was the City Council President in 1976, Ms. Friedman worked in his office as housing omsbudsman.
        From 1970 to 1976, she was Representative Bella Abzug's administrative aide in the 20th Congressional District of Manhattan. In 1982 she joined the staff of Local 1-3 of the Fur, Leather and Machine Workers Union as a secretary, a post she held until 1988, when she retired.
        During the 1980's she was also vice president of the Lincoln Towers Tenants Association and a member of the executive board of the New York State Neighborhood Coalition.
        She is survived by a daughter, Jill, of Manhattan; a son, Dr. Michael, of Berkeley, Calif., and two grandchildren.
