        Her group, Atelje 212, became the first Yugoslav theater company to perform in the United States after World War II when she staged Edward Albee's ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf'' in 1968 in Lincoln Center. She also produced the Theater of Nations Festival in Yugoslavia in 1976 and in France in 1984.
        She is survived by her husband, Dragoljub Trailovic.
