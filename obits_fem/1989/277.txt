        Mrs. Murphy was a graduate of Scripps College in Claremont, Calif. In the early 1970's, she and her husband, George, a physician, formed Asphalt Green Inc. in an effort to salvage the abandoned Municipal Asphalt Plant at York Avenue and 90th Street. They raised money to renovate the building and in 1984 it reopened as a community arts and sports center.
        There are no immediate survivors.
