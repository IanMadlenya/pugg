        Arvia MacKaye Ege, a poet and a founder of the Rudolph Steiner Educational and Farming Association, died Wednesday at her home in Hillsdale, N.Y. She was 86 years old.
        Mrs. Ege, daughter of the playwright Percy MacKaye, wrote ''The Secret Iron of the Heart,'' published in 1982, and ''The Battle for the Sunlight: A Modern Legend,'' which was reissued in 1983, both by the Admonis Press. Another book, ''The Power of the Impossible,'' is scheduled for release this year.

It is the umbrella organization for the Hawthorne Valley Farm, a dairy farm; the Hawthorne Valley School; the Hawthorne Valley Visiting Students Program, an environmental center, and the Hawthorne Valley Artists and Artisans. All are in the Hudson Valley near Hillsdale.
        Surviving are a brother, Robert MacKaye of Spring Valley, N.Y., and a sister, Christy Barnes of Hillsdale.
