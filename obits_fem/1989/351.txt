        Mrs. Janeway's works were widely exhibited and purchased by museums, including the Museum of Modern Art and the Cooper-Hewitt Museum. In 1966, she became the first American to design for the celebrated British company, Josiah Wedgwood & Sons. She was the author of ''Ceramics and Pottery Making for Everyone,'' published in 1950 by Tudor Publishing.
        Born in Columbus, Ohio, she was a community board member for at least 10 years and led campaigns to preserve the small-scale neighborhood character of Greenwich Village. She served on the zoning and landmarks committees of the community board.
        Surviving are her sister, Mary Harwood of Washington, Conn., and her daughter, Sister Catherine, of Evansville, Ind.
