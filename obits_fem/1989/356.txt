        Maria C. Sanchez, a Connecticut State Representative who built a political base from a small convenience store in Hartford, died on Saturday at her home there. She was 63 years old and died of natural causes, said Robert Clark, director of the DeLeon Funeral Home in Hartford.
        Representative Sanchez, a Democrat, moved to Hartford from Comerio, P.R., in the 1950's. She ran a convenience store in Hartford's North End, a predominantly Puerto Rican neighborhood, and was elected to the Hartford Board of Education in 1973. She held that post until her death.
        Mrs. Sanchez, who was known for her work on behalf of Hispanic causes, was elected to the state House of Representatives in 1988.
        ''She was a leader in her community,'' said Gov. William A. O'Neill. ''With her recent election as State Representative, she was clearly becoming a leader in the state.''
        Mrs. Sanchez, a widow, is survived by four brothers: Jose J. Collon of Hartford; Benigno Collon, Arcardio Collon, and Pedro Collon, all of Comerio, and a sister, Luz Consuelo Fuentes, of Comerio.
