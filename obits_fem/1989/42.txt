        Helene Eliat van de Velde, a psychologist and writer who elucidated Freudian insights into the literary portrayal of human behavior, died of cardio-respiratory failure on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 95 years old.
        Born in Berlin, Mrs. van de Velde moved in cultural circles in Berlin and in Paris, where she settled in the 1930's. She wrote several short stories and a novel, ''Sheba Visits Solomon,'' published in America by Viking Press in 1932.
        The book, which dealt with the legendary visit of Balkis, the Queen of Sheba, to King Solomon, was assessed in The New York Times Book Review as ''a gay, amusing, witty, sophisticated and exceptionally shrewd novel'' casting an unorthodox light on the meeting between the virgin Queen and the imposing monarch.
        Mrs. van de Velde trained in psychoanalysis under two prominent pupils of Sigmund Freud, Karl Abrams and Hans Sachs, before coming to the United States during World War II. Later she returned to attend the Institute of Applied Psychology in Zurich under Rudolf Brun. In 1954 she began her practice in New York under the supervision of Theodore Reik, founder of the Psychological Association for Psychoanalyasis.
        She is survived by her daughter, France-Helene Weindling of Manhattan, and a grandchild.
