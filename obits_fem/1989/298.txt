        Princess Gina of Liechtenstein, wife of the head of state, died today, the Government announced. She was 67 years old.
        The popular Austrian-born Princess had been hospitalized since last month for treatment of an undisclosed illness. A Government communique said her condition suddenly worsened Tuesday.
        She is survived by her 83-year-old husband, Franz Josef II, the world's longest-ruling head of state.
        They married in 1943, five years after Franz Josef II took office as the 12th ruling prince of Liechtenstein, a tiny principality between Austria and Switzerland. In 1984, Franz Josef II turned over the running of the country to his son, Hans Adam, oldest of their five children, but he remained head of state.
