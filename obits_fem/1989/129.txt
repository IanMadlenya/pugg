        The silent-film actress Marion Mack, a small-town girl who became a Mack Sennett bathing beauty and Buster Keaton's co-star in the classic film ''The General,'' died of heart failure on May 1. She was 87 years old.
        Miss Mack, whose name originally was Joey Marion McCreery, was born in Mammoth, Utah, and came to Hollywood in April 1920.
        ''I went to Mack Sennett's studio, and they gave me a job right away at $25 a week,'' she told The Los Angeles Times in a 1987 interview.
        As a bathing beauty, she was in many short films, and then acted in comedies and features for other studios before writing and starring in a semiautobiographical film, ''Mary of the Movies.'' She eventually adopted the screen name Marion Mack.
        Her best-known role was in Keaton's 1927 Civil War comedy, ''The General,'' in which she played his estranged girlfriend, who is accidentally kidnapped by Yankee spies.
        She later abandoned acting to write scripts for her husband, the producer Louis Lewyn. In 1949, she began selling real estate, and the couple settled in Costa Mesa. Mr. Lewyn died in 1969.
        Although ''The General'' was a critical and financial failure when it was released, it is now considered to be among Keaton's best films. When interest in the film was revived in the 1970's, a film historian asked Miss Mack to appear at film-festival screenings.
        ''I enjoyed going back to traveling with the movie and being an actress again,'' she said.
        Miss Mack is survived by her son, a stepsister and three grandchildren.
