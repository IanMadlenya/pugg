        Anne Ackerman, a political worker whose support was courted by candidates for condominum board member to President, died of cancer Monday at her home. She was 75 years old.
        Her political activity was honed in Chicago in the campaigns of Mayor Richard J. Daley and accelerated when she moved to a Florida waterfront condominium in 1969. A Democrat, she roused retirees into powerful voting blocs that were dubbed ''condo commandos.''
