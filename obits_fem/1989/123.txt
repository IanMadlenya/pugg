        Janice Poliak, a philanthropist whose donation helped establish the Center for the Study of First Amendment Issues at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, died of lung cancer yesterday at Danbury (Conn.) Hospital. She was 79 years old and had homes in Redding, Conn., Manhattan and Montego Bay, Jamaica.
        Mrs. Poliak and her husband, Saul, president of Kotch & Poliak Inc., a New York concern that produces industrial expositions and conferences, donated $3 million to establish the Columbia center in 1983. The gift was the largest in the school's history.
        Besides her husband, Mrs. Poliak is survived by a brother, Edmund Perls of Miami.
