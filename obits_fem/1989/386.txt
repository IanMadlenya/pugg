        Beatrice Hessen, an editor of her father's well-known philatelic journal, died of cancer on Thursday at her home in Palo Alto, Calif. She was 52 years old.
        Mrs. Hessen, who attended the University of Michigan and held a master's degree from Columbia University, was the managing editor of The Minkus Stamp Journal, one of the largest national journals for stamp collectors. She also worked closely with her father, Jacques Minkus, who owned the stamp collecting department at Gimbels Department Store in New York, an important outlet for philatelists.
        She also wrote freelance articles about education, ran a book-distribution service and, in 1985, became a personal-injury lawyer.
        In addition to her father, she is survived by her husband, Robert, a senior research fellow at the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace, at Stanford University, and by their children, Laura, 21, and John, 20.
