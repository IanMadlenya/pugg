        Allegra Knapp Mertz, the only woman to win yachting's most prestigious accolade, the Nathanael D. Herreshoff award, died yesterday at the Swedish Hospital in Seattle. She was 76 years old.
        Mrs. Mertz, who lived in Rye, N.Y., had traveled to Seattle with her husband, James M. Mertz, for a Navy reunion. She became ill there and died of heart failure and pneumonia.
        Mrs. Mertz sailed for most of her life. For 25 years, she was president of the Blue Jay Class Association, a group representing owners of the 14-foot sailing dinghy. She received the Herreshoff trophy in 1966 from the North American Yacht Racing Union, sailing's national governing body at the time, for her leadership and accomplishments in the sport. She was also chairman of the union's women's division for 24 years.
        She competed eight times for the Mrs. Charles Francis Adams Cup, a national sailing championship for women. Mrs. Mertz won the event as skipper four times. She was an eight-time winner of the Syce Cup, a trophy for the women's sailing champion of Long Island Sound.
        In addition to her husband, she is survived by two children, James B. Brickell Jr. of Sykesville, Md., and Allegra Mertz Torrey of Rowayton, Conn.; a brother, Arthur Knapp Jr. of Larchmont, N.Y.; a sister, Marina Beach of Rye, and three grandchildren.
