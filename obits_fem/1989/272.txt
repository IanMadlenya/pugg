        Miss Honeycutt was co-author with James A. Kinney, a veterinarian, of ''How to Raise a Dog in the City, In the Suburbs,'' a highly praised book with drawings by James Thurber. It was published in 1939, and a revised edition appeared in 1969.
        Miss Honeycutt, who moved to New York from Plain Dealing, La., was a producer for WOR in the radio station's infancy. She married the writer St. Clair McKelway, managing editor of The New Yorker magazine before Harold Ross.
        She was recognized as an authority on Southern cooking and for a time operated her own catering service.
        There are no survivors.
