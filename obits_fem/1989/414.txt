        Mrs. Kaiser founded Kaiser Handi-Book Publishers in 1958 and developed telephone directories for 110 communities. The company was sold in 1986 to Transwestern Publishing, a division of U.S. West, a California-based utility.

She established nine scholarship funds for students in communities served by her directories, with awards made on the basis of community service and academic achievement.
