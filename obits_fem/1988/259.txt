        Dr. Wall, a native of Paterson, N.J., was a consultant to the cosmetics industry. She graduated from St. Elizabeth's College in Convent Station, N.J., in 1913 and became the first woman to receive the medal of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists as ''the foremost authority on this branch of education.''
        She earned her doctorate at the New York University School of Education, where she taught in the 30's and 40's.
        In 1923, she became one of the first women admitted as a Fellow of the American Institute of Chemists. She was inducted into the Cosmetology Hall of Fame at the New York World's Fair in 1965.
        Dr. Wall was a technical editor for several publishing companies and established the first post-graduate school for specialists in hair-coloring in the 1920's.
        There are no immediate survivors.
