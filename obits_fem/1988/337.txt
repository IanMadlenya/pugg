        Sondra T. Ordover, a longtime editor and publisher of paperback books, died of a brain tumor Monday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 59 years old and lived in Manhattan and in Woodstock, N.Y.
        A native of New York and a graduate of the University of Iowa, Mrs. Ordover was an editor at Fawcett Books during the 1960's and joined Ballantine Books in the 1970's. There she initiated a number of novels based on television shows and motion pictures. In the late 1970's she also published a number of novelizations at Jove, the paperback unit of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich.
        Ms. Odover eventually became publisher of Jove, and in 1983 she was named president and publisher of Pinnacle Books, a mass-market publisher.
        She is survived by her husband, Alfred, and two sons, Joshua Touster of Boston and David Touster of Los Angeles; two stepchildren, Sarah Ordover of New York, and Andrew Ordover of Woodstock; and her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Emanuel Hellman of Bay Harbor, Fla.
        A funeral service will be held at Riverside Chapel tomorrow at 11 A.M.
