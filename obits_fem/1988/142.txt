        Tabatha Foster, a 3-year-old who was the world's longest survivor of a five-organ transplant, died today after an infection caused her heart, kidneys and liver to fail.
        The girl died in the intensive care unit at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, a hospital spokeswoman said. ''It was system failure, everything,'' said the spokeswoman, Sue Cardillo ''It was like a chain reaction.''
        Tabatha's parents, Roy and Sandra Foster, were at her side and had told doctors not to try to revive her if her heart stopped, Ms. Cardillo said.
        The girl received a liver, a small intestine, a pancreas and parts of a stomach and a colon in a 15-hour operation that ended Nov. 1.
        Well-wishers from around the country, including President Reagan and Frank Sinatra, donated more than $350,000 to help meet her medical expenses. Tabatha also received boxloads of toys, cards and notes from schoolchildren.
        Because of an intestinal deformity, doctors were forced to remove 95 percent of the girl's small bowel three days after she was born. She was placed on a highly concentrated liquid diet, which damaged her liver.
