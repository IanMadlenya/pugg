        Toni Frissell, a photographer, died of Alzheimer's disease Sunday in the St. James (L.I.) Nursing Home. She was 81 years old and lived in St. James.
        She was born in Manhattan and began working as a fashion photographer for Vogue in 1931. She later photographed for Harper's Bazaar. She enlivened her fashion images by posing models clad in evening gowns out-of-doors, rather than inside studios.
        In 1941 she covered World War II as a freelance photographer. Later, she was the official photographer of the Women's Army Corps. In the 1950's, she worked for Sports Illustrated and Life.
        Three books were illustrated with her photographs, ''Mother Goose,'' ''A Child's Garden of Verse'' and ''The Happy Island,'' on Bermuda.
        Miss Frissell's husband, Francis M. Bacon 3d, died several years ago. She is survived by a daughter, Sidney Bacon Stafford of Bellport, L.I.; a son, Varick Bacon of Manhattan, three grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.
