        Muriel Snowden, co-founder of the non-profit Freedom House that pushed for integration and self-help in Boston's predominantly black Roxbury section, died of cancer at her home Friday. She was 72 years old.
        Mrs. Snowden and her husband, Otto, began Freedom House in 1949 after calling 17 people to their home to discuss how black and white residents of Boston could unite on common problems.
        They ran the organization from their home for three years and then bought a building for it.
        By the time the Snowdens retired in 1984, the organization had become a catalyst for urban renewal, job fairs, affirmative action and innovative school programs. The Snowdens were also a force for calm during Boston's school integration crisis of the 1970's.
        ''The work of an organization like ours is never done,'' Mrs. Snowden once said.
        In June 1987, she was one of 32 Americans who were given ''no strings'' grants by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. For five years, each fellow receives an annual stipend ranging from $30,000 to $75,000.
        In June, the Boston School Committee voted to rename a high school in Mrs. Snowden's honor.
        Mrs. Snowden is survived by her husband, a daughter and a granddaughter.
