        Erica Sherover-Marcuse, an organizer of workshops aimed at the resolution of cultural conflicts, died of liver failure last Thursday at her home in Oakland, Calif. She was 49 years old.
        Ms. Sherover-Marcuse, the widow of the Marxist philosopher Herbert Marcuse, was a co-director of New Bridges, a group formed in 1985 to promote multicultural awareness among teen-agers. In bringing together people of differing backgrounds at encounter sessions, she sought to eliminate the causes of racism and bigotry.
        After the death of her husband in 1979, Ms. Sherover-Marcuse conducted such sessions in many parts of the United States and in Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and Israel, where she assembled Arabs and Jews to air their innermost feelings about each other.
        Born in New York, she received a bachelor's degree from Oberlin College and a doctorate from Goethe University in Frankfurt am Main.
        Ms. Sherover-Marcuse is survived by a sister, Yeshi Neumann of Oakland.
