        Nico, who sang with the pop group Velvet Underground and became one of Andy Warhol's film stars, died Monday after falling off a bicycle on the Spanish island of Ibiza. She was 49 years old.
        Her manager, Alan Wise, said she died in a hospital on the island a few hours after the accident. A coroner's report said she had suffered a cerebral hemorrhage, Mr. Wise said.
        Nico was born in Germany and named Christa Paffgen. She grew up in Berlin and worked as a model in Paris and Rome before getting a minor role in 1960 in Federico Fellini's film ''La Dolce Vita.''
        In the 1960's she moved to New York, joining the artist Andy Warhol's coterie of what he called ''superstars.'' She appeared in Warhol's film ''Chelsea Girls,'' and was featured with the Velvet Underground, singing songs written by the group's leader, Lou Reed.
        Her solo album, ''Chelsea Girl,'' included songs written by Bob Dylan and Jackson Browne, and was followed by three more albums.
        She is survived by her son, Ari.
