        Ms. Vinton was born in West Point, Miss., and came to New York in the 1930's, when she published several short plays.

She was director of publications for the Boys Clubs of America for 20 years, and was an active member of Pen and Brush and the Women's National Book Association. She was married to Louis German, who died in 1969.
