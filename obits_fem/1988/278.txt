        Margerie Bonner Lowry, an actress and a writer, and the widow of the writer Malcolm Lowry, died in a Los Angeles nursing home last Wednesday. She was 83 years old.
        Mrs. Lowry worked closely with her husband on his 1947 novel ''Under the Volcano,'' typing and editing the manuscript, and is generally considered to be the model for its central female character, the consul's wife, Yvonne.
        Born in Washington, Mrs. Lowry acted in B movies starting in 1923 and was the co-star with her sister, Priscilla Bonner, in ''Paying the Price'' (1927). She wrote two mystery novels published in the late 1930's, ''The Shapes That Creep'' and ''The Last Twist of the Knife.''
        She and Mr. Lowry married in 1940. After his death in 1957, she was the co-editor of his ''Dark as the Grave Wherein My Friend Is Laid'' (1968), and she edited his ''Psalms and Songs'' (1975) among other works.
        Mrs. Lowry is survived by her sister.
