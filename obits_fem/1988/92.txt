        Dr. Bessie Lee Gambrill, a specialist in elementary education who served on the faculty of Yale University for three decades, died yesterday at Yale-New Haven Hospital. She was 105 years old and lived at Whitney Center, a retirement home in Hamden, Conn.
        Dr. Gambrill was the first woman to earn a tenured post at Yale in a subject other than nursing. She was appointed an assistant professor of elementary education in 1923, after having taught philosophy at Alfred University and psychology at the New Jersey State Teachers College in Trenton.
        After graduating in 1902 from Western Maryland College, which she had entered at the age of 15, she began her career in education by teaching in a one-room schoolhouse. She received her Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1921. During her career she was noted for her research on intelligence tests for children and for promoting mental hygiene programs in schools.
