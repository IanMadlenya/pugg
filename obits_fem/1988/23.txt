        Miss Laskin was credited with reviving many musical scores written for the harp by such composers as Handel and Saint-Saens.
        She was born Aug. 31, 1893, in Paris and began playing the harp as a child, giving her first public concert at age 12. Four years later, she became the first woman to play harp at the Paris Opera.
