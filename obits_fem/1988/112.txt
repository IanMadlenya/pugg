        Born in New York City, Mrs. Rauch, who performed as Lillian Shapero, trained in dance with Michio Ito and Louis Horst. She joined the Graham company in 1929. During her six years with the company, she performed in many Graham classics, among them ''Heretic'' and ''Primitive Mysteries.'' Miss Graham used Miss Shapero as her stand-in while choreographing the latter dance.
        Mrs. Rauch worked as a choreographer with the Maurice Schwartz Art Theater from 1932 to 1952. She also created dances for the Lillian Shapero Dance Group from 1936 to 1939. Her last choreography was for a 1982 television production of ''Higher Than Heaven,'' a folk cantata composed by Maurice Rauch, her husband, and based on a story by Itche Goldberg.
        Mrs. Rauch was known for adaptations of modern-dance technique for Yiddish theater and for her teaching, which included dance for actors at the New School for Social Research, and modern dance in New York City high schools.
        Mrs. Rauch is survived by her husband; a son, Paul, and two granddaughters.
