        Aliza Sass Rubin, who founded the West Side Jewish Community Nursery School 10 years ago and directed it until her retirement last year, died early yesterday at her daughter's home in Connecticut, following a brief illness. She was 74 years old and a resident of Manhattan.
        Mrs. Rubin was born in Poland, where she earned a law degree. She worked in nursery schools in Paris and Israel after World War II, came to New York in 1953 and graduated from Bank Street Teachers College.
        Before founding her nursery school on West 86th Street, she was associated with the Ramaz School and a nursery school operated by the Society for the Advancement of Judaism. Since her retirement, she had been working to complete her memoirs as a Holocaust survivor, ''Chapters of a Journey.''
        Mrs. Rubin is survived by two daughters, Dr. Nira Silverman of North Haven, Conn., and Edna Sussman of Manhattan; and five grandchildren.
