        Miss Weitzner was one of the few people to achieve curatorial status at the museum without a formal education in anthropology. She joined its staff in 1908 as a secretary to Clark Wissler, the noted ethnologist who was then chairman of the museum's department of anthropology.
        Miss Weitzner retired as associate curator of anthropology in 1956 but continued at the museum until her death. At age 88, she published a monograph on the Hidatsa Indians that is considered to be a significant contribution in the field of North American ethnology.
        She is survived by a nephew, Richard, of Stamford, Conn., and a niece, Judith Louis of Eugene, Ore.
