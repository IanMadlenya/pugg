        Gertrude Golden, a publicity agent for many postwar feature films imported from Italy and France, died of cancer yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 75 years old and also lived in East Hampton, L.I.
        Mrs. Golden represented ''Open City'' and ''Paisan,'' by Roberto Rossellini, and ''Shoe Shine'' and ''Bicycle Thief,'' by Vittorio De Sica. She also represented Brigitte Bardot and her first major movie, ''And God Created Woman,'' by Roger Vadim, as well as films imported by Donald Rugoff, Edward Kingsley and Joseph Burstyn.
        In 1969, Mrs. Golden was a founder of the Film Makers of the Hamptons Festival, which shows pictures in which Hamptons residents had been involved. The festivals have been held at Guild Hall in East Hampton.
        Mrs. Golden is survived by her husband, Herbert L. Golden, and her mother, Minnie Fisher.
