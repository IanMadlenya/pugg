        Carolyn Ann Franklin, a singer and songwriter, died of cancer on Monday. She was 43 years old.
        Among Miss Franklin's compositions were ''Gotta Find Me an Angel'' and ''Ain't No Way,'' both made into million-record sellers by her sister, Aretha.
        She also arranged ''Take Another Little Piece of My Heart'' by Erma Franklin, another sister and singer, a song later made popular by Janis Joplin.
        Miss Franklin was born in Memphis and moved with her family to Buffalo and then to Detroit in 1946. As a child, she formed a singing group with members of the young people's choir at the New Bethel Baptist Church, where her father was the pastor.
        She, Erma and their cousin, Brenda Bryant, sang background on Aretha Franklin's early records.
        She is survived by her sisters, her grandmother and two brothers.
