        Mrs. Begun, with her husband, Isidor, also a teacher and longtime Communist Party member, were affiliated with the extreme leftwing faction in the union. The union, Local 5 of the American Federation of Teachers, its parent, lost its charter in 1941.
        Besides her husband, she is survived by two sisters, Adelaide Schnittman of West Palm Beach and Barbara Batnik of Montana.
