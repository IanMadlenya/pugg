        Nora Hodges, a teacher at the Dalton School for three decades and later a Peace Corps volunteer and staff member, died of heart failure Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89 years old.
        A native of Vienna, she was the daughter of an industrialist and came to the United States in 1929. She married Charles Hodges, a New York University professor, and their rooftop loft on lower Fifth Avenue became a meeting place for New York intellectuals and artists in the 1930's and 40's.
        From 1936 until 1965, she taught at Dalton, where she established a community-service program that became a widely copied model.
        In 1966, after her husband's death, she taught English in Tunisia as a Peace Corps volunteer, then toured the United States to promote enlistment of the elderly in the corps.
        She is survived by a daughter, April H. Herbert of Pound Ridge, N.Y.
