        Janice Groman, a former member of the New York City Ballet and American Ballet Theater who later founded a chamber dance company, died at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx on Friday after a long illness. She was 51 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Miss Groman was born in New Britain, Conn., where she studied ballet with Lillian Sjovall before moving to New York at the age of 11 to study at the Professional Children's School and at the American Ballet Theater School. She danced a wide variety of corps and solo roles in the City Ballet through the 1950's and then became a soloist in Ballet Theater in the early 1960's.
        Miss Groman left a few years later to join the First Chamber Dance Quartet, a small troupe that been formed in 1961 by two dancers she had known in the City Ballet, Lois Bewley and William Carter. After that troupe disbanded in 1969, Miss Groman and Charles Bennett, a member of the first troupe, formed the First Chamber Dance Company. Original Choreography
        Like the Quartet, the First Chamber Dance Company made its mark by touring extensively and presenting original choreography. Miss Groman and Mr. Bennett were joined by Michael Uthoff, Lisa Bradley and Marjorie Mussman, all former Joffrey Ballet members. Unlike the Quartet, which concentrated on ballets by its own members, the second group also drew from outside choreographers.
        In recent years, Miss Groman headed the Groman Dance and Exercise School in New York.
        She is survived by her father, Walter E., of New Britain; and three brothers, Walter J., of Toronto, John E., of Dedham, Mass., and Dr. David B., of Prince Edward Island, Canada.
