        Estelle Wolf, a founder of Friends of Central Park, died of pneumonia Sunday at Mt. Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 102 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        An avid bird watcher in Central Park, Miss Wolf became the informal membership chairman of Friends when it was founded in 1966. At the time she was 80 and, as a member of Community Board 8, the oldest community-board member in New York. She has since retired.  Six years ago, she was still an active member of the Lenox Hill Democratic Club and the League of Women Voters.
        Born in Grand Rapids, Mich., she attended Simmons College in Boston and moved to New York during the Depression. A cat lover and a photographer, Miss Wolf combined those passions and exhibited her cat pictures in New York galleries.
        In her work for Central Park, Miss Wolf recruited members for Friends and helped out during parks events. Staunchly opposed to encroachment into the park, she fought establishment of the croquet fields, a proposed polo ground and expansion of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
        When she turned 100, she was honored by the Parks Department at a ceremony at City Hall. ''She's the grand old lady of parks,'' said Henry J. Stern, the Parks Commissioner. ''She went tirelessly to meetings. She was an old-fashioned civic activist.''
        There are no survivors.
