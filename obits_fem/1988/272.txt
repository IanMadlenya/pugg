        Sheila Scott, a British aviator who in 1971 became the first woman to pilot a flight circling the world by way of the North Pole in a light aircraft, died today of lung cancer, her literary agent said. She was 61 years old. Miss Scott, a former actress, flew her way into aviation history with more than 100 flying records, trophies and awards. She made three solo flights around the world and set records for single-handed London-Cape Town and Cape Town-London flights.
        She began her career acting in provincial theaters after World War II and won minor roles in films and television. She developed her passion for flying in the late 1950's, winning her first air race in 1960 and going on to make a reputation as Britain's top woman aviator.
        In 1966 she became the first British pilot to make a solo round-the-world trip in a light plane. In 1967, she won the Harmon International Aviation Trophy, and she was made an officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1968.
        In 1971, after four tries in 12 years, Miss Scott passed her test for an automobile driver's license. She explained her problems by saying: ''It is terribly difficult to adjust to driving a car when you are accustomed to using your feet on rudder pedals. I wanted to haul back on the steering column and fly away.''
        She wrote three books about her experiences and was working on an autobiography when she died after a year fighting cancer.
        ''She put up a real battle, but she lost,'' her literary agent said.
