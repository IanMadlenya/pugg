        Karol Fageros Short, a former tennis champion who stirred a clothing controversy at Wimbledon 30 years ago, died of cancer Tuesday. She was 53 years old.
        Mrs. Short won the Canadian and the German national championships and was a finalist at the United States Clay Court Championship and the French Open and a semifinalist at Wimbledon.
        In 1958, after she wore gold lame underpants in the French Open, Wimbledon officials banned her. She was reinstated when she agreed to cover the underpants with white lace.
        Mrs. Short is survived by her husband, Eugene; two daughters, Kristin and Karri, and three stepsons, Larry, David and Dale.
