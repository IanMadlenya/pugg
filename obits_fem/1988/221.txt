        Queenie A. McFarland, who was ac tive until two years ago in the manage-ment of Sweets seafood restaurant, a family business at Fulton and South Streets, died of cardiac arrest Sunday at Mountainside Hospital in Glen Ridge, N.J. She was 91 years old and lived in Caldwell, N.J.
        Mrs. McFarland was a daughter of James Lake, who in 1917 acquired Sweets, the oldest seafood house in New York City, founded by Abraham M. Sweet in 1842. Her sister, Lea Lake, died in April at 89 after having been a co-owner of Sweets since 1933, when their father died.
        Mrs. McFarland was involved with the restaurant in childhood but was associated for several decades with Ohrbach's specialty store. In 1962, after her retirement there, she rejoined Sweets. She worked there until two years ago, when she was severely injured by an intruder at the restaurant during the victory parade in lower Manhattan for the New York Mets, who had won the World Series.
        Mrs. McFarland is survived by two sons, John, of East Hanover, N.J., and Benjamin, of Andover, N.J.; five grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.
