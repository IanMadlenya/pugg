        Hester R. McCullough, whose denunciation of two entertainers as Communist supporters became a nationwide political issue in the late 1940's, died of renal cancer Sunday at her home in Bryn Mawr, Pa. She was 71 years old.
        Mrs. McCullough, then living in Greenwich, Conn., returned a subscription ticket to a local performance by Paul Draper, a dancer, and Larry Adler, a virtuoso of the harmonica, whom she accused of being members of Communist front organizations.
        In a letter published in a local newspaper, Mrs. McCullough wrote that the entertainers, ''while fine artists, have been openly denounced in the press as being pro-Communist and, as such, I do not believe should appear in any community project in Greenwich.''
        The artists brought a $200,000 libel suit against Mrs. McCullough, which resulted in a hung jury in May 1950 and was later dismissed on a legal technicality.
        Meanwhile, the charges had become a cause celebre among political columnists of the period. Her supporters included Westbrook Pegler and Fulton Lewis Jr. Unable to find work in the United States during the period of the suit, Mr. Adler and Mr. Draper left the country for several years.
        Mrs. McCullough was born in Philadelphia and was a graduate of London University. She married John T. McCullough, a former picture editor at Time magazine, who died in 1978.
        She is survived by a son, Bruce, of Los Angeles.
