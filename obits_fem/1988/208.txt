        Jean Porter Dubos, who collaborated in biological and environmental research for several decades with her husband, Rene Dubos, died of ovarian cancer Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 70 years old.
        Mrs. Dubos, who was born in Upper Sandusky, Ohio, joined the Dubos Laboratory at the Harvard Medical School in 1942 and moved two years later to the Rockefeller Institute (now Rockefeller University) in New York City when Dr. Dubos rejoined it. Together, they established a new laboratory to study tuberculosis. They were married in 1946.
        Mrs. Dubos was co-author with her husband in 1950 of ''The White Plague - Tuberculosis, Man and Society,'' which stressed the role of social reform rather than surgical intervention or drugs to control disease and was a forerunner of other works in the social history of medicine.
        The couple's close collaboration led to several books on a philosophy of the human environment. Mrs. Dubos was a founder of the Rene Dubos Center for Human Environments, in which she remained active until her death.
        Mrs. Dubos, whose husband died in 1982, is survived by a niece, Jennifer Porter of Cambridge, Mass.
