        Esther Gottlieb, retired dean of girls at the Fashion Industries High School in New York and the widow of Adolph Gottlieb, the Abstract Expressionist painter, died of cerebral meningitis on Monday. She was 81 years old and lived in New York City and East Hampton, L.I.
        Mrs. Gottlieb was the founder and president of the Adolph and Esther Gottlieb Foundation, set up in 1976 according to provisions in her husband's will to assist older artists in need. The foundation, with assets of some $6 million derived from the sale of Mr. Gottlieb's works, gives 10 grants a year and maintains an emergency assistance program. The foundation will continue, its director, Sanford Hirsch, said.
        Mrs. Gottlieb was born in Danbury, Conn., on April 15, 1907. She came to New York in 1924, studied art at Pratt Institute and became a painter, working in the garment industry to support herself. In 1932 she married Mr. Gottlieb, and began teaching tailoring skills at the Cental Needle Trades High School - now Fashion Industries High School. She supported her husband financially, eventually giving up her own painting to work as his studio assistant. She retired in 1960. Mr. Gottlieb died in 1974.
        Mrs. Gottlieb is survived by two sisters, Frances Dick and Gladys Sikora, both of New York City, and six nieces and nephews.
        A funeral service will be held today at 10:30 A.M. at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue, at 81st Street.
