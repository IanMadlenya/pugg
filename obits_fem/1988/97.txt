        Camilla Ravera, a founder of the Communist Party in Italy and a champion of women's rights who became the first woman elected to the Italian Senate, died Thursday at her Rome apartment, her family reported. She was 98 years old.
        Miss Ravera helped found the party in 1921 but was expelled in 1943 because she bitterly criticized Stalin and the nonaggression pact of 1939 between the Soviet Union and the Nazis.
        She was reinstated during the 1950's and was elected to the Senate in 1982.
        She was one of just nine people given the honorary title of senator for life and remained active in Italian politics through 1983.
        In 1930, she was arrested for anti-Fascist activities and sentenced to 15 years in prison by a special tribunal. She served five years in jail and eight in internal exile before being freed after the Allied invasion of Italy.
        In Parliament, Miss Ravera sought to extend women's rights, and she wrote a history of the women's movement in Italy.
        Miss Ravera was a close friend of former President Sandro Pertini, a Socialist, who nominated her as senator for life.
        A group of students visiting the presidential mansion once asked Mr. Pertini if he thought a woman could hold his post. ''Why not,'' President Pertini replied. ''One Camilla Ravera is an example.''
