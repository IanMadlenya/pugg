        Dr. McGraw, whose work was hailed by Dr. John Dewey, the educator and philospher, conducted a behavior study with the Woods twins, Johnny and Jimmy, and others at the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, where she was associate director of the Normal Child Development Center from 1930 to 1942. The study was published in 1935 and was followed by a second work, ''The Neuromuscular Maturation of the Human Infant,'' in 1943.
        She was appointed professor of psychology at Briarcliff College in 1953 and taught there until 1972, when she retired.
        Dr. McGraw was born in Birmingham, Ala., and graduated from Ohio Wesleyan University. She received a Ph.D. from Columbia University.
        She was married to Rudolph F. Malina, a research engineer, who died in 1970.
        Dr. McGraw is survived by a daughter, Mitzi Wertheim of Washington, and two grandchildren.
