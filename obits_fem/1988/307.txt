        Veronica Castang, an actress who performed on and Off Broadway, on television and in a film, died of ovarian cancer on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 50 years old.
        Miss Castang made her Broadway debut in 1966 in ''How's the World Treating You?'' Her other New York plays included ''The National Health,'' ''Whose Life Is It, Anyway?'' ''Cloud 9'' and ''After the Prize.'' She often appeared in plays produced at the Phoenix Theater and the Manhattan Theater Club, including ''Sea Marks,'' a two-character play in which she also starred on television.
        On television, Miss Castang starred in ''The Elephant Man''; in ''The Widowing of Mrs. Holyroyd''; in the PBS series ''Theater in America''; in the movie ''A Doctor's Story,'' which also starred Art Carney; as a guest on the sitcom ''Kate and Allie,'' and in episodes of the soap operas ''As the World Turns'' and ''All My Children.'' In a Drama by Howard Fast
        In 1982, she played the American-born wife of David Ben-Gurion, the first Prime Minister of Israel, in the two-person drama ''David and Paula'' by Howard Fast, at the 92d Street Y. Richard F. Shepard called her performance brilliant. Writing in The New York Times, Mr. Shepard said Miss Castang ''expresses exactly the right degree of basic love, laced with exasperation, common sense and a strong will of her own.''
        Miss Castang was a native of London and studied at the Sorbonne and at Questor's Theater in London.
        She is survived by her stepfather, Clive Baker of London, and an aunt, Hilda Castang of Battle, England.
