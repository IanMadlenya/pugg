She was 80 years old. Mrs. Lizio was born in San Angelo, Italy, in 1908 and came to the United States with her husband, Anthony, in the 1920's. They settled on Chicago's West Side, where they opened their first restaurant in 1937.
        They closed it in 1962 and began selling pizzas to other restaurants. The Quaker Oats Company acquired the product in 1969.
