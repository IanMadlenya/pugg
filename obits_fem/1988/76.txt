        Bessie Heard, who endowed her hometown of McKinney with a wildlife sanctuary and natural science museum, died Tuesday night, a museum spokesman said Wednesday. She was 101 years old.
        More than 40,000 visitors each year come to the Heard Natural Science Museum and Wildlife Sanctuary, which Miss Heard endowed in 1964. It includes more than five miles of nature trails, said Steve Runnels, the museum's director of development.
        Miss Heard was the eldest of five daughters. Her father, John Spencer Heard, spent four years in the Confederate Army and then opened a general store in McKinney, north of Dallas, with his brother.
        Survivors include two cousins.
