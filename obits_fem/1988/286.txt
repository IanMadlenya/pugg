        Judith Charach Wyker, who as Judith Garden delighted generations of New Yorkers with her flower designs, died of cancer yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 81 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        In the 1940's, she opened a flower shop on East 57th Street under the name Judith Garden. Her arrangements were the opposite of the stiff, formal style of the day. She combined unusual flowers with natural materials, like twigs and branches, and often placed them in unconventional containers. She retired from the shop in 1970.
        She is survived by her husband, Ben Wyker, and a brother, Bernard Charach of Fort Lee, N.J.
