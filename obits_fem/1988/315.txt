        Pannonica de Koenigswarter, a patron of jazz performers, died Wednesday of heart failure at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 74 years old.
        The Baroness de Koenigswarter offered sustanance and care to many musicians who needed help. The saxophonist Charlie Parker died in her home in 1955, and the composer and pianist Thelonious Monk lived there from 1970 until his death in 1982. Recently she had been influential in helping Barry Harris's Jazz Cultural Theater to survive.
        A member of the English branch of the Rothschilds, Baroness de Koenigswarter moved to the United States in the early 1950's. As a teen-ager she had fallen in love with jazz, and she quickly became a part of the jazz world. She counted among her friends Charlie Rouse, who also died Wednesday; Coleman Hawkins, Tommy Flanagan, Barry Harris and many other important jazz musicians. They returned her affection: Mr. Monk wrote the tune ''Pannonica'' for her; the pianist Horace Silver wrote ''Nica's Dream'' and the saxophonist Gigi Gryce wrote ''Nica's Tempo.''
        She is survived by three daughters, two sons and one grandchild. There is to be a memorial service on Dec. 11 at St. Peter's Church, 54th Street and Lexington Avenue.
