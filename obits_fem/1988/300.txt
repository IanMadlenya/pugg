        Mrs. Frank was active in New York theater for more than 30 years, producing such plays as Robert Anderson's ''Tea and Sympathy,'' which ran from 1953 to 1955 and featured Deborah Kerr's Broadway debut; ''Sabrina Fair'' (1953); ''One More River'' (1960), and ''K2,'' Patrick Meyers's 1983 drama about two mountain climbers in the Himalayas. She also produced several works by Alan Paton, including ''Too Late the Phalarope'' (1956) and ''Sponono'' (1964).
        Mrs. Frank was president of the New Dramatists Committee, a group supporting new playwrights, from 1960 to 1969. She bought a ranch near Old Snowmass, Colo., in the mid-1960's, and devoted many years to raising Thoroughbred race horses.
        Mrs. Frank is survived by a daughter, Maud E. Frank of Bellerose, L.I., and a grandchild.
