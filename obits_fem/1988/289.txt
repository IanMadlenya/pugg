        Vet Boswell, the last surviving member of the popular and influential 1930's singing trio the Boswell Sisters, died Saturday. She was 77 years old and lived here.
        Miss Boswell died in Peekskill Community Hospital, where she had been admitted with pneumonia, her daughter, Chica Minnerly, said.
        Helvetia Boswell - she was known by her nickname - and her sisters Martha and Connee were born and brought up in New Orleans.
        They gained fame in the late 1920's and early 30's for harmonies and arrangements that filtered jazz and blues into a style that was a precursor of swing and influenced such performers as Ella Fitzgerald, the Mills Brothers and the Andrews Sisters.
        Among the trio's popular songs were ''Dinah,'' ''Yes Sir, That's My Baby,'' ''The Music Goes Round and Round'' and ''Top Hat.'' They appeared in three feature films and several shorts.
        She retired from performing when the trio broke up. Martha died in 1958 and Connee, who had a successful solo career, died in 1976.
        Vet Boswell is survived by her daughter, three grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.
