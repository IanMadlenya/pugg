        Miss Pincus received a special Tony Award in 1976 in recognition of her services to the Broadway musical. As a music copyist - a term she disliked because it failed to convey the scope of her contribution - she worked on the orchestration of more than 150 Broadway shows, as well as Off Broadway productions and scores for commercial films, documentaries, television shows and commercials.
        Miss Pincus grew up in Philadelphia, where she studied music and played the viola. She took up her career almost by accident. ''At one time, there was illness in the family and we needed extra money, so I did occasional music copying,'' she once recalled. ''One thing led to another.''
        Miss Pincus left no immediate survivors. Funeral services will be held today in Philadelphia.
