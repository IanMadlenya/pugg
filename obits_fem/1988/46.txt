        Margaret Parker Isaac, the manager of the Fourcade Gallery in Manhattan for 14 years until last October, died in an automobile accident on Dec. 19, just outside of Winchester, Va. She was 35 years old. Her 14 month-old daughter, Marina, survived the crash unharmed.
        Ms. Isaac, a native of Birmingham, Ala., began at the gallery as a secretary and soon became Mr. Fourcade's administrative assistant, handling the business accounts of most of the gallery's artists, including Willem de Kooning, Malcom Morley, John Chamberlain, Joan Mitchell and Catherine Murphy. When the gallery closed last October, Ms. Isaac and her husband moved to Winchester.
        She is survived by her husband, Daniel, and her daughter, both of Winchester; her parents, Beth and John Parker of Pittsburgh, and her brothers, Joseph and John Jr. A memorial service will be held this evening at 6:30 in the former spaces of the gallery, at 36 East 75th Street.
