        Sarah Larkin Loening, a writer who founded the Biblical Garden at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, died Monday at Southampton (L.I.) Hospital. She was 91 years old and lived for many years in Southampton.
        Mrs. Loening donated the money to buy the original plants for the Biblical Garden, which was established in 1973, containing varieties of plant life mentioned in the Bible. She remained the head of the organization operating the garden, which has been seen by thousands of visitors, on the grounds of the Episcopal cathedral at Amsterdam Avenue and 112th Street.
        Mrs. Loening was the author of 10 books, most of them under the name Sarah Larkin. Her first was ''Three Rivers'' (1934), a narrative in blank verse about French settlers in Canada.
        She was a dame commander of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, an Anglican church order.
        Mrs. Loening was the widow of Albert Palmer Loening, an early leader in the aircraft industry who was a founding stockholder and director of the Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation, which later became the Grumman Corporation. Mr. Loening, who was Mayor of Southampton from 1936 to 1942, died in 1974.
        Mrs. Loening is survived by a brother, Lawrence Larkin of Tallahassee, Fla.; a son, Albert Palmer Loening Jr. of Rochester Hills, Mich., and a grandson.
        A funeral service is to be held at noon today at St. John's Episcopal Church in Southampton.
