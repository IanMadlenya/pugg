        Leonor K. Sullivan, a 12-term Democratic member of the House of Representatives, the only woman ever elected to Congress from Missouri, died today of heart failure. She was 86 years old.
        Mrs. Sullivan died at St. Anthony's Medical Center, where she had been admitted Aug. 21, her 86th birthday, said a hospital spokesman, Bill Feustel. She had suffered from heart and respiratory problems in recent years.
        Mrs. Sullivan, the former Leonor Kretzer, began her political career after she married Representative John B. Sullivan in 1941. For the next 10 years she aided him in his work serving the Third Congressional District, which includes southern St. Louis. Her husband died in 1951.
        A year later, Mrs. Sullivan was elected to her husband's seat in the House. She held it until she stepped down in 1976. Mrs. Sullivan was succeeded by Representative Richard A. Gephardt, a Democrat who remains the Third District's Representative.
        ''She was a distinguished and an effective legislator, much loved by the people of St. Louis,'' Mr. Gephardt said. 'Her contributions to our community and the nation will have long-lasting effects.''
        In her years in Congress, Mrs. Sullivan became a prominent environmentalist and consumer advocate. She pressed for preservation of environmental resources and improved employment conditions, as well as consumer protection laws for foods, drugs and cosmetics. In 1954, she was an author of legislation creating the food-stamp program.
        Mrs. Sullivan is survived by three sisters. Arrangments for her funeral were pending.
