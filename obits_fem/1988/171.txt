        Virginia Ram, program director of the Episcopal Church of the Epiphany in East Los Angeles and a former national Episcopal leader, died May 18 at her home in Los Angeles, apparently of heart failure. She was 65 years old.
        Mrs. Ram, who was an elected member of the National Executive Council of the Episcopal Church from 1976 to 1982, was a leader among Mexican-Americans in Los Angeles and was one of the founders of the United Neighborhood Organizations, which became a major force in the city.
        From her base at the Church of the Epiphany, Mrs. Ram developed and directed programs for the young and old and expended much energy in behalf of the hungry and homeless. Her efforts on behalf of Hispanic ministry brought her to national attention and were part of the Episcopal booklet series ''Nuestra Historia''.
        She is survived by two sons, Richard and Philip, both of Los Angeles, and two grandchildren.
