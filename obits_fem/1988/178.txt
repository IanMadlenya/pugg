        Mildred Gillars, known during World War II as Axis Sally for her propaganda broadcasts for Nazi Germany, has died. She was 87.
        Ms. Gillars, who died Saturday, had moved here after her release in 1961 from Federal prison, where she served 12 years after her conviction for treason.
        In her trial in 1949, Ms. Gillars said she was born in Portland, Me., in 1900. She said she attended Ohio Wesleyan University but left before graduating and traveled to Germany, where she took a radio job in 1940.
        ''Hello, gang,'' her broadcasts to Allied forces began. ''Throw down those little old guns and toddle off home. There's no getting the Germans down.''
        After the war, American military officials found her living in cellars of bombed-out buildings in Berlin. She was returned to the United States in 1948 and charged with treason.
        Ms. Gillars testified that she had fallen in love with a German Foreign Service officer who talked her into making the broadcasts.
        She was convicted and sentenced to 10 to 30 years in prison. She served 12 years at Alderson, W.Va. After her release, she moved to Columbus and taught music at a kindergarten.
        There was no announcement of her death. A private funeral was held, said her attorney, James Sauer.
        He knew of no surviving relatives.
