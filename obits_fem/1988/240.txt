        Miss Norden appeared in many films in the late 1940's and 1950's, including ''An Ideal Husband,'' ''Mine Own Executioner,'' ''The Idol of Paris,'' ''Interrupted Journey'' and ''The Black Widow.'' A protegee of the British director Sir Alexander Korda, she was considered a leading postwar British sex symbol. She won a Venice Festival award for most promising actress in 1947, and the British National Film Award for her performance in ''Saints and Sinners'' in 1949.
        Ms. Norden was a member of the Old Vic theater company in London, and appeared in Dublin with the Abbey Players before moving to New York in 1952. She made her Broadway debut in 1960 in ''Tenderloin,'' and subsequently appeared in ''Marat/Sade'' and ''Scuba Duba.'' Although she became an American citizen, she returned to London in 1979 and acted in many plays, movies and television shows in the 1980's, including ''Little Shop of Horrors.''
        Ms. Norden is survived by her husband, George Heselden, of London; a son, Michael Cole of Guernsey, in the Channel Islands,, and a sister, June Shipp of London.
