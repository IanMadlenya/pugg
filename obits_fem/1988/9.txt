        Beth Campbell Short, who covered Eleanor Roosevelt for The Associated Press and held a top White House job in Harry S. Truman's Presidency, died of cancer Monday. She was 79 years old.
        Mrs. Short worked for The Springfield (Mo.) Leader and The Daily Oklahoman before she was hired in 1936 to cover Mrs. Roosevelt, who allowed only women to her news conferences.
        Mrs. Short's husband, Joseph, became Truman's press secretary in 1950, and the President hired her as correspondence secretary when Mr. Short died in 1952.
