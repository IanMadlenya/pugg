        Hannah Johnson Howell, chief librarian of the Frick Art Reference Library of the Frick Collection from 1948 until 1970, died Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 82 years old.
        A native of Oskaloosa, Iowa, Mrs. Howell studied library science at Columbia University, from which she received a graduate degree in 1928. She joined the Frick library that year as a photoarchivist, and later became reference librarian of the library's reading room.
        Under her leadership as chief librarian, the Frick Art Reference Library dramatically increased its collection of books and study photographs of paintings, drawings, sculpture and illuminated manuscripts.
        She is survived by a brother, J. Kelly Johnson, of Waitsfield, Vt.
