        Margaret Mee, a botanical artist and explorer of Amazonian rain forests, died in a car accident, her family said Friday.
        Mrs. Mee was 79 years old. She was killed Wednesday in an auto crash near Seagrave in central England, her family said.
        In 1952, she and her second husband, Greville Mee, went to live in Rio de Janeiro. She had recently returned to Britain to open an exhibition of her paintings at the Royal Botanic Gardens in west London.
        Mrs. Mee was also in Britain for the publication last month of her diaries, ''In Search of the Flowers of the Amazon Forests,'' and a lecture tour.
        Mrs. Mee was born near London and studied art as a child.
        She made the first of her 15 Amazon expeditions in 1956 to observe, collect and paint flowers. Her last trip there was in May when she traveled to the Igapo forest on Brazil's Rio Negro to paint the rare, night-blooming Amazonian moonflower.
        ''As I stood there with the dim outline of the forest all around, I was spellbound, '' she wrote in her diaries. ''Then the first petal began to move and then another as the flower burst into life,''
        Mrs. Mee became a leader in the campaign to conserve the rain forests and protect the forest Indians.
        The recently established Margaret Mee Amazon Trust provides scholarships to help Brazilian botanists study in Britain.
        She is survived by her husband.
