        Ethel Saniel Brook, an essayist and former professor of French literature at New York University and Hofstra University, died of congestive heart failure Saturday at St. Luke's Hospital. She was 84 years old. During her career, Mrs. Brook served as liaison in France for the Loyalist international brigades during the Spanish Civil War. After World War II, she was the interpreter for Andre Malraux during his tour of the United States. Mrs. Brook was also a strong supporter of the legal defense of the Hollywood Ten against blacklisting during the 1950's.
        Mrs. Brook was working on a historical memoir of the early 20th century, titled ''The Hatpin Era,'' at her death. The book is to be completed by a colleague, Walter James Miller, a poet and professor at New York University.
        She is survived by a daughter, Sue Saniel Elkind, of Pittsburgh, and a son, James Brook, of New York. A memorial service is to be held at St. Paul's Chapel, Columbia University, on March 13 at 2 P.M.
