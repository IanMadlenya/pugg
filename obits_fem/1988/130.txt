        Douce Fleming Correa, founder of the Fleming School, died of cancer Wednesday at her Manhattan home. She was 82 years old. She founded the school, at 35 East 62d Street in Manhattan, in 1956 to provide a blend of American and French education. In fact, it was meant as an alternative to the Lycee Francais, where Mrs. Correa had taught mathematics and science for almost 30 years.
        Born in St.-Martin in the French Antilles, Mrs. Correa graduated from the Ecole Universelle in Paris and earned a master's degree from New York University. In 1982, she was made a Commandeur of the Palmes Academiques, the highest French honor for educators.
        Survivors are her son, Ray-Eric of Manhattan; three sisters, Dina Fleming Moreno, Lise Nunes and Nellie Engle, all of Miami, and a brother, Oger, of St.-Martin.
