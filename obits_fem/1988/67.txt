        Beulah Bryant, a blues singer, died Sunday in Bird S. Coler Memorial Hospital after a heart attack. She was 69 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Dinah Washington, the singer known as the ''Queen of the Blues,'' once called Mrs. Bryant ''one of the best rhythm-and-blues people I know.''
        One of Mrs. Bryant's last performances in New York was with Sippi Wallace and Big Mama Thornton in the 1980 Newport Jazz Festival program, ''Blues Is a Woman,'' at Avery Fisher Hall.
        Mrs. Bryant traveled internationally from the 1940's to 1975 to perform for American servicemen under auspices of the United Service Organizations. She recorded on the Spivey label.
        She also made guest appearances on television shows and stood out, even as an extra, in feature films, including ''Hospital,'' ''The Taking of Pelham One Two Three,'' ''Fame,'' ''Kramer vs. Kramer'' and ''Going in Style.'' At Abyssinian Baptist Church, of which she was a member, she served in many groups, including the scholarship committee.
        Mrs. Bryant is survived by her sister, Bessie Myers, of San Francisco, and her son, Otis V. Bryant Jr., of Sylmar, Calif.
