        Marisa Bellisario, president of Italy's Italtel telecommunications company and former head of Olivetti Corporation of America, died of cancer today at her home in Turin. She was in her early 50's.
        Miss Bellisario was appointed managing director and chief executive officer of the state-owned Italtel group in 1981. Italtel, formally Italtel Societa Italiana Telecomunicazione, is the 34th largest company in Italy, according to reports, and one of several telecommunications operations in that nation.
        When she took over, losses were more than $215 million a year. She cut the losses in half in 1982 and then returned it to profitability, where it has remained under her direction.
        She wrote her own life story in the book ''Woman and Top Manager,'' frequently worked 12-hour days, but refused to work weekends in order to spend the time with her husband, Lionello Cantoni, a mathematics professor.
        ''Maybe I can show young girls that you can make it and still be a normal woman, with normal attitudes toward your family or husband,'' she said.
        Before joining Italtel, Miss Bellisario was president and chief executive of Olivetti of America. She joined the company in 1972 and became director of corporate planning and then director of the Distributed Data Processing group.
        She became the head of product and operations planning at General Electric Information Systems Italia in 1965 and kept that post when the electronics division was acquired by Honeywell Information Systems Italia in 1969.
        Miss Bellisario, an economics graduate of Turin University, began her business career in Olivetti's computer division in 1960.
