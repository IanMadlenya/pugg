        Christina Paolozzi Bellin, a former model and an international social figure in the 1960's, died of a brain tumor Wednesday night at her home in Manhattan. She was 49 years old.
        The daughter of Alicia Spaulding, a United Fruit Company heiress, and Count Lorenzo Paolozzi, she was born in New York, grew up in Rome, and was educated in Switzerland and at the Madeira School in Greenway, Va.
        She began her modeling career in New York at age 17. A nude photograph of her by Richard Avedon in Harper's Bazaar in 1962 caused a sensation. Unclothed figures did not appear in fashion magazines at that time.
        In 1964, she married Dr. Howard Bellin, a plastic surgeon. They were known for their lively parties attended by an eclectic group that included Andy Warhol, Jacob K. Javits, Zsa Zsa Gabor, karate instructors and whatever glamorous personality happened to be in town, Dr. Bellin recalled. They were divorced in 1982, remarried four months later when Mrs. Bellin fell ill, and divorced again when she seemed to be recovering.
        She is survived by two sons, Marco and Andy, her sister, Francesca, and her mother, all of Manhattan.
        The funeral will be at 3 P.M. tomorrow at St. James Episcopal Church, at 865 Madison Avenue, at 71st Street in Manhattan.
