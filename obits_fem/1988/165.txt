        Mrs. Josephson was in private practice and assisted the late Emanuel H. Bloch in defending Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed for passing atomic secrets to the Soviet Union.

In the 1940's, Mr. Josephson owned two cabarets called Cafe Society, one on Sheridan Square and one on East 58th Street, where many jazz artists, including Billie Holiday and Lena Horne, gained popularity.
        Mrs. Josephson, who was born in Brooklyn, graduated from Hunter College and the Columbia University Law School.
        Surviving are her mother, Rose Agrin of Manhattan; a sister, Ruth Koban of West Palm Beach, Fla., and two sons, Edward and Louis, both of Manhattan.
