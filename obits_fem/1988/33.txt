        Coral Eaton Kinsolving, a former advertising and newspaper executive who was active in New York City community affairs and the management of Democratic political campaigns, died of cardiac arrest on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 57 years old.
        Mrs. Kinsolving, who graduated from the Hewlett School in Islip, L.I., and Lycoming College in Williamsport, Pa., was a media researcher and program analyst for the McCann-Erickson and Bryan Houston advertising agencies in the 1950's.
        She was a sales promotion and research executive for The New York Herald Tribune from 1960 until the paper ceased publication in 1966. Later, she placed commercials for advertisers on radio and television and bought, sold and managed real estate.
        She was president of the Murray Hill Democratic Club from 1967 to 1969 and was a member of Community Planning Board 5 in midtown Manhattan in the 1970's. She managed Nanette Dembitz's campaign for the State Court of Appeals in 1972 and was an executive in campaigns by Paul O'Dwyer for the United States Senate in 1970 and Herman Badillo for mayor in 1973.
        She is survived by her husband, Charles M. Kinsolving Jr., an executive with the Newspaper Advertising Bureau, and an uncle, Steven Sertic of Tampa, Fla. A memorial service will be announced later.
