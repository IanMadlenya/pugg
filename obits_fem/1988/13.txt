        Mrs. Betzak, who was born in Russia and grew up in Goldsboro, N.C., worked as an accountant for many years before taking up painting full time. A graduate of New York University, she began exhibiting her works in individual and group shows at galleries throughout the United States in the 1960's. Her oil paintings are primarily colorful, abstract works.
        She was president of Burr Artists, an artists' collective, and was active in many other organizations, including the National Arts Club and the National Museum of Women in the Arts.
        Mrs. Betzak is survived by a sister, Bella Shore of Forest Hills, N.Y., and a brother, Elias Margoles of Atlanta.
