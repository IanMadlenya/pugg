        Marghanita Laski, a novelist, critic and prolific amateur lexicographer, died Saturday, according to her family. She was 72 years old.
        A graduate of Somerville College at Oxford, Miss Laski published her first novel, ''Love on the Supertax,'' in 1944, and followed it with five others by 1953, including ''The Victorian Chaise-Longue.''
        She then turned to criticism, with books on Charlotte Yonge, Jane Austen, George Eliot and Rudyard Kipling and two studies of religious and esthetic experience, ''Ecstasy'' and ''Everyday Ecstasy.''
        One of her novels, ''Little Boy Lost,'' was turned into a movie in 1953 that starred Bing Crosby. Her 1959 television play ''The Offshore Island'' was about life in Britain after an atomic holocaust.
        Miss Laski was widely known as a radio broadcaster. From 1979 to her death she was a member of the Arts Council of Great Britain, which channels government aid to the performing and visual arts.
        Throughout her life, language remained one of Ms. Laski's great passions. Dr. Robert Burchfield, who started editing the four supplements to the Oxford English Dictionary in 1960, said Ms. Laski was his biggest contributor.
        She is survived by her husband, John Howard, who founded the Cresset Press, and by a son and a daughter.
