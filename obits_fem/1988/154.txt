        Adele De Leeuw, who wrote more than 75 children's books, died of cancer of the colon Sunday at her home in Plainfield, N.J. She was 88 years old.
        Miss DeLeeuw, who often collaborated with her sister, Cateau De Leeuw, started her career as a librarian in Plainfield, where she conducted a story hour for children. This led to her own storytelling. After her travel book ''The Flavor of Holland'' was published in 1928, she produced books regularly.
        Among them were ''Dr. Ellen,'' ''The Barred Road,'' ''Hawthorne House'' and, with her sister, ''The Expandable Browns'' and ''Mickey the Monkey.''
        Miss DeLeeuw, who was born in Hamilton, Ohio, leaves no survivors.
