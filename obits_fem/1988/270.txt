        Dr. Beatrice Braude, a retired professor of French and former radio producer, died Sunday of brain cancer at the Hebrew Home of Greater Washington in Rockville, Md. She was 75 years old and lived in Washington.
        Dr. Braude, a professor at the University of Massachusetts in the 1970's, previously worked for the State Department in Washington and Paris.
        She was dismissed in 1953 and she discovered years later, through the Privacy Act, that she had been blacklisted as a security risk because her name had been found in the address book of a convicted spy.
        Dr. Braude sought to sue the Government, but the statute of limitations had expired. At the time of her death she was seeking the passage of a special act of Congress to waive the statute in her case.
        She was born in Manhattan and was a graduate of Hunter College. She earned a doctorate at the City University of New York.
        Surviving is her brother, Theodore, of Manhattan.
