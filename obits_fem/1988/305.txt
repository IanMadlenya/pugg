        Gwendolyn Cafritz, known as one of Washington's leading hostesses for several decades, died of cancer Tuesday at her home. She was 78 years old.
        Mrs. Cafritz gave elegant and lavish parties from the end of World War II until the early 1970s, when failing health curtailed her social schedule.
        Her husband, Morris Cafritz, a millionare Washington real estate developer and businessman, died in 1964. After his death, she became president of the Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation, which gave about $6 million a year to local organizations devoted to the arts, community service, health and education.
        The Cafritz party guests ranged from the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, who once danced on a transparent dance floor lighted from below, to Supreme Court justices. President Harry Truman, however, favored Mrs. Cafritz's competitor, Perle Mesta.
        Mrs. Cafritz, born in Budapest, Hungary, moved to Washington in the 1920's. In June 1986 she gave her last large party, which was described as a ''trip back into Washington social history.''
        In 1969, four masked men broke into her mansion, bound and gagged Mrs. Cafritz and others, and escaped with more than $1 million in furs and jewelry.
