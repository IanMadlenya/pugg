        Henrietta Jacobson, a longtime star of the Yiddish theater in New York, died of heart failure Sunday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 82 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Miss Jacobson was one of the most venerable actresses and comediennes of the Yiddish theater, which flourished on the Lower East Side during the first half of the century. The daughter, wife and mother of Yiddish actors, she made her stage debut at age 3 in Chicago, where she was born.
        After her 1912 New York debut in ''Israel's Hope,'' Miss Jacobson spent much of the next seven decades performing in such Yiddish plays and musicals as ''It Could Happen to You,'' ''The World of Mrs. Solomon,'' ''Go Fight City Hall'' and ''Kosher Widow.'' Her husband, Julius Adler, was almost always her co-star in New York and on the road. They produced and directed at the Downtown National Theater and other Lower East Side playhouses, with Miss Jacobson often designing the sets and doing the choreography.
        Miss Jacobson starred on the long-running radio series ''My Mother and I'' in the 1940's. She made her Broadway debut in Neil Simon's 1962 ''Come Blow Your Horn,'' and appeared in the 1971 musical ''70, Girls, 70'' and in the 1980 film ''Hero at Large.''
        In addition to her husband, Miss Jacobson is survived by a son, Bruce, of Manhattan.
