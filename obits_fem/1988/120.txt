        Lea Lake, for the last 55 years a proprietor of Sweet's, the oldest seafood restaurant in New York City, died of heart failure at Lutheran Hospital in Brooklyn on Sunday. She was 89 years old and lived in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn.
        Miss Lake was involved with the restaurant from her childhood.
        It was founded in 1842 by Abraham M. Sweet on Fulton Street in Manhattan in what is now the South Street Seaport. Miss Lake's father, James, walked into the restaurant on the morning after the Great Blizzard of 1888 asking for work and was hired as a waterboy - the job today known as busboy. Twenty-nine years later he bought Sweet's from the proprietor's son, Edward.
        Miss Lake took over on the death of her father in 1933. A small, soft-voiced woman, she was in charge for many decades. One of the first things she did in 1933 was to discontinue the boarding house that had been an adjunct of the restaurant since its early days.
        Sweet's operated continuously in the block known as Schermerhorn Row, between South and Front Streets, except for two periods. One was in the years just before and during the Civil War, and the other covered 18 months in 1982 and 1983 when the landmark house occupied by the restaurant was restored.
        Miss Lake's partner, Andrew Gerzel, who has managed the restaurant since 1966, recalled last night that as a young woman, she had aspired to a career in show business and had appeared in at least one Broadway musical in the 1920's.
        Miss Lake is survived by her sister, Queenie A. McFarland of Caldwell, N.J.
