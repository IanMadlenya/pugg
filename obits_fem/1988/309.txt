        Elizabeth Ramos, who won a $750,000 jury verdict in an AIDS malpractice case and later became an advocate promoting understanding of the disease, died Friday. She was 33 years old.
        In January of this year a jury found her doctor, Dr. Kenneth Bernstein, negligent in treating and diagnosing Ms. Ramos in 1985. She was originally diagnosed as having asthma and imaginary ailments; she was found to have pneumocystis pneumonia, an ailment common to those suffering from acquired immune deficiency syndrome. She was awarded $500,000 and her two sons, Christopher and Matthew, also plaintiffs, were awarded $125,000 each.
        In September 1987 another jury ruled against Ms. Ramos, but she was granted a second trial. She testified that she had caught the AIDS virus from a former boyfriend who used intravenous drugs.
        Ms. Ramos, a former bookkeeper, went on to attend conferences around the country to talk about AIDS among Hispanic Americans. She also visited schools to talk to children about the disease and advised them not to be prejudiced against those afflicted with it.
