        Mrs. Bury's family established the angler's haven, attracting fly-fishermen eager to fish at Junction Pool, where the Beaver Kill and Willowemoc rivers join.
        Besides her husband, survivors are a son, Douglas, of Seattle; three daughters, Betsy Parker and JoAnn Ficke of Denver and Mary Ellen Grades of Tucson, Ariz., and four grandchildren.
