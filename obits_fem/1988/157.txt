        Alice May Hall, a noted puppeteer during a career spanning more than 70 years, died Monday at her home in Brooklyn. She was 96 years old, and had given her final performances just last weekend.
        During the last 15 years, this English-born creator and manipulator of marionettes performed with Lillian Oppenheimer at the Origami Center of North America in New York. She had first created her marionettes in the early 1900's with her mother, drawing her plots and characters from ballets and classical romantic literature.
        Miss Hall was a founding member of the Puppetry Guild of Greater New York and worked for years with the celebrated puppeteer Frank Parrish.
        She is survived by a cousin, Emil Spahn of Elmhurst, N.Y., who with his wife had performed with Miss Hall for many years.
        A funeral service will be held today at 8 P.M. at the Krauss Funeral Home, 1097 Hempstead Turnpike, Franklin Square, L.I.
