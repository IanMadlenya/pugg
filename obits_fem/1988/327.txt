        Daw Khin Kyi, widow of a Burmese independence leader and mother of an opposition leader, died today after a long illness, her family said. She was 76 years old.
        Daw Khin Kyi, whose husband, Gen. Aung San, was assassinated in 1947, was the mother of Aung San Suu Kyi, a Burmese opposition leader.
        Aung San Suu Kyi returned to Rangoon in April from exile in London to look after her mother, who had been bedridden since suffering a stroke earlier this year. After returning to Rangoon, Aung San Suu Kyi took a leading role in the pro-democracy demonstrations that swept Burma.
