        In 1972, after the death of Mr. Hoover, Miss Gandy said she had destroyed his personal correspondence. She testified before a House subcommittee studying charges of F.B.I. harassment of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. that Mr. Hoover had ordered her to do so.
        Surviving Miss Gandy are her niece, Elizabeth Pugh of Deland, and three nephews, Lawrence Gandy of Orlando, Fla., Charles Gandy and Edward Gandy, both of Newport, N.J.
