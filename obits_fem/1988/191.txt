        Lyn Blumenthal, a leading video artist who was also a prominent lecturer and writer, died of a heart attack at her home in Manhattan on Thursday. She was 39 years old.
        In 1976, Ms. Blumenthal was a co-founder of the Video Data Bank, for which she and a colleague, Kate Horsfield, taped more than 160 interviews with leading visual artists of the 1960's and 70's. Based at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Data Bank later expanded to become the country's largest video art archive.
        Ms. Blumenthal, a native of Chicago, received a graduate degree from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1976. She moved to New York City shortly thereafter and began her career as a video artist. Her works were shown at the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Museum of Modern Art and elsewhere in this country and Europe.
        She also became well-known as a consultant to alternative arts organizations, and as a panelist and adviser to agencies that included the National Endowment for the Arts.
        Among her last projects was ''What Does She Want,'' a series of six feature-length video art films by different artists focusing on women's issues.
        She is survived by her father, Dr. Sunoll Blumenthal, and her mother, the former Frima Horwitch, both of Chicago, and by her brother, Alan, of Miami.
