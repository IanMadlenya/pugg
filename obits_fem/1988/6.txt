        For some time Mrs. Vaughan had been suffering from Cushing's disease, a disorder of the adrenal cortex.
        She made her directorial debut in Central Park in 1961 when she staged Shakespeare's ''Richard II,'' starring Ben Hayes and J. D. Cannon. She had first gone to work for the festival's founder, Joseph Papp, as an unpaid volunteer, cutting scripts, sewing costumes and collecting props.
        She subsequently directed several festival productions. In 1962 she directed a touring company production of ''Macbeth'' and co-directed ''King Lear'' with Mr. Papp. She also staged ''The Winter's Tale'' (1963), ''Othello'' (1964), ''Coriolanus'' (1965) and ''Macbeth'' (1966).
        Mrs. Vaughan taught Shakespearean acting at the festival and at Circle in the Square Theater School. She took up painting in 1970 and worked in the Abstract Expressionist style in Los Angeles and New York.
        Mrs. Vaughan's marriage to the director Stuart Vaughan ended in divorce. She is survived by her brother, Eugene Vernon Regier of Vancouver, British Columbia.
