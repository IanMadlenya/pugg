        In 1927, Miss Maricle made her Broadway debut in ''The Trial of Mary Dugan'' as a wise-cracking Follies girl. She performed in ''The Sex Fable'' with Mrs. Patrick Campbell and portrayed the mayor's wife, Mrs. Shinn, in ''The Music Man.'' Her last Broadway appearance was in 1962 in ''Never Too Late'' with Maureen O'Sullivan. Her films included ''The Hard Way,'' ''Theodora Goes Wild'' and ''Woman Chases Man.''
        Miss Maricle is survived by acousin, Marijane Maricle of Manhattan and a niece, Joan Hickman of Lake Charles, La.
