        Lynn L. Seidler, the former executive director of the Shubert Foundation, which provides grants to support live professional theater and dance, died on Thursday while vacationing in the Turks and Caicos Islands. She was 67 and lived in Sanibel, Fla.
        The cause was lung cancer, which was diagnosed a year ago, said her husband, Lee J. Seidler.
        Ms. Seidler became the foundation's first director in 1975, turning it into one of the largest grant-making institutions for the arts in the country.
        Under Ms. Seidler's leadership, the program took an unconventional approach to giving money. Instead of putting funds into bricks and mortar, she set Shubert grants aside for non-profit theaters, drama schools and dance companies in need of help with operating expenses.
        The foundation currently distributes several hundred grants each year, ranging from $5,000 to $275,000. Last year it gave $13 million.
        Ms. Seidler also founded the Shubert Archive. In 1976 she dusted off a trove of materials that for years had been sitting in boxes in the attics and basements of various Shubert theaters. With six million items, the archive is now one of the largest collections of theater memorabilia in the country.
        Ms. Seidler retired from the foundation in 1994.
        She was born Lynn Lopatin in New Brunswick, N.J., on Aug. 13, 1936. She received a bachelor's degree in liberal arts from Lake Erie College in 1958 and a master's degree in speech therapy from New York University in 1970.
        In addition to her husband, she is survived by her father, William Lopatin of Sanibel; a daughter, Laurie, of San Jose, Calif.; and a grandson.
