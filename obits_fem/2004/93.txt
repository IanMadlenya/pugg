        Joan Stitt McMenamin, who retired in 1992 after 21 years as head of the Nightingale-Bamford School, a college preparatory school for girls, died on Saturday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 79.
        Her death was announced by the school, where she became the fifth headmistress in 1971.
        Mrs. McMenamin arrived at the school, which is on East 92nd Street, 10 years earlier for a few weeks to help the office cope with a spate of final reports.
        She stayed to teach history, then became the assistant headmistress to Catherine Woodbridge, whom she later succeeded.
        Reared in Scarsdale, N.Y., she attended the Masters School in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., graduated from Smith College in 1946 and studied at the Katherine Gibbs Secretarial School.
        She went to Paris in 1949 to work for the Marshall Plan administration, then became an office manager for the Ford Foundation in New York before joining Nightingale-Bamford. After retiring, Mrs. McMenamin was interim head of San Francisco University High School in the late 1990's.
        Mrs. McMenamin's husband of 51 years, Edward B. McMenamin, a former secretary of Columbia University, died in 1994. She is survived by two sisters, Barbara Greene of Jacksonville, Fla., and Britton Stitt of San Francisco.
        Correction:  June 17, 2004, Thursday  An obituary on Tuesday about Joan Stitt McMenamin, former headmistress of the Nightingale-Bamford School in Manhattan, misstated the day of her death and referred incorrectly to one survivor. Ms. McMenamin died last Friday, not Saturday. Britton Stitt of San Francisco was her brother, not her sister.
