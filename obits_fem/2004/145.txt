        Janet R. Whitman, former president and chairwoman of the Sheltering Arms foster care agency in New York, died on Sept. 25 at her home in Manhattan. She was 85.
        The cause was complications of breast cancer, said her son Charles S. Whitman III.
        Mrs. Whitman, who was an officer or board member of several other charities and societies, belonged to a politically prominent family. Her father-in-law, Charles S. Whitman, was a governor of New York, and her daughter-in-law Christie Whitman is a former governor of New Jersey.
        Mrs. Whitman was born Janet Russell on Jan. 2, 1919, in Manhattan and was a graduate of the Brearley School and Bryn Mawr College.
        She was on the board of the Society for the Relief of Women and Children for more than 50 years, and she spent 35 years on the board of the Stony Wold-Herbert Fund, which makes grants to fight pulmonary disease.
        Mrs. Whitman was national president of the Daughters of the Cincinnati, a historical society started by women descended from Revolutionary War officers, and was on the board of the Colonial Dames of America.
        Her husband of 61 years, Charles S. Whitman Jr., a civil court judge, died in 2002. Besides her son Charles, her survivors include another son, John R., husband of the former governor; a daughter, Janet; and three grandchildren.
