        Timi Yuro, the pop singer whose throaty and soulful delivery made ''Hurt'' and other songs hits in the early 1960's, died on March 30 at her home in Las Vegas. She was 63.
        The cause was cancer, said her niece, Michelle Duval.
        Ms. Yuro's hits, like ''I Apologize,'' ''For the Love of a Boy'' and ''What's a Matter Baby (Is It Hurting You),'' featured her husky alto rising to dramatic climaxes above gentle orchestral accompaniment.
        Her songs had the sentimentality of teenage pop, but in her vocals Ms. Yuro borrowed the bluesy intensity of black jazz singers like Dinah Washington and Nancy Wilson.
        Ms. Yuro began her career with ''Hurt,'' which reached the Top 10 in 1961, and it remained her signature song. Though recorded when she was barely out of her teens, she sang it with a strength and finesse that earned her a reputation as a soul powerhouse; her voice was often mistaken for that of a black woman or a man.
        Born Rosemary Timotea Aurro in Chicago, she moved to Los Angeles as a child and began singing in her family's Italian restaurant. She signed with Liberty Records in 1959 and recorded ''Hurt'' with Clyde Otis, who had been a producer for Dinah Washington. The song, which had first been an R & B hit for Roy Hamilton in 1953, was later sung by Elvis Presley and Juice Newton.
        Ms. Yuro had a string of hits with Liberty until she left the label in 1964, when she began recording with Mercury and other companies. She quit in the 1970's and her attempts to return to music in the early 80's were stymied by throat cancer.
        She is survived by her husband, Robert Selnick, of Las Vegas, from whom she had separated; a daughter, Milan Reinoehl; a brother, Anthony; and three grandchildren.
