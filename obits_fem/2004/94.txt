        Rosemary Breslin, a journalist and screenwriter who wrote a piquant memoir about her own stubbornly undiagnosable illness, died yesterday at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. She was 47.
        The cause was cardiac and renal failure associated with a blood disorder, family members said. Fourteen years ago, she began suffering increasingly serious bouts of what she thought was influenza but was later labeled an autoimmune blood disorder.
        In the 1990's, Ms. Breslin and her father, Jimmy Breslin, the Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaper columnist, both published books about their life-threatening illnesses and gave joint interviews about them.
        Mr. Breslin's book, ''I Want to Thank My Brain for Remembering Me'' (Little, Brown and Company, 1996), was about his successful operation for a brain aneurysm. Ms. Breslin's book, ''Not Exactly What I Had in Mind: An Incurable Love Story'' (Random House, 1997), was about coping with regular and painful blood transfusions while also growing into a marriage and career.
        In 1992, Ms. Breslin married Anthony Dunne, an independent builder of movie sets who later became a producer of documentary films. In 1993, while she was briefly a writer for ''NYPD Blue,'' Ms. Breslin was hospitalized for a month at U.C.L.A. Medical Center. She recovered and was able to write her book and, in 2000, help her husband establish an Internet venture, HauteDecor.com, a virtual interior design center that foundered, like many other Web ventures of the time.
        In 2002, Ms. Breslin and Mr. Dunne won awards for two documentaries related to the aftermath of Sept. 11, 2001, ''Women of Rockaway'' and ''A Smile Gone, But Where?''
        Ms. Breslin graduated from Hamilton College. In addition to her husband, father and stepmother, Ronnie M. Eldridge, a former City Councilwoman, she is survived by her sister, Kelly, and her brothers, James, Kevin, Patrick and Christopher.
