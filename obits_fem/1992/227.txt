        Dr. Dorothy Richardson Jones, an author and professor emeritus of English at Queens College died on Friday at Rutland (Vt.) Regional Medical Center. She was 81 years old and lived in Dorset, Vt., and Hollywood, Fla., since her retirement in 1973.
        She died of liver cancer, said her companion, Dr. Wyatt D. Jones.
        Professor Jones, a native of Flushing, Queens, graduated from Hood College and held a master's degree from Columbia University and a Ph.D. from the University of Michigan. She was the author of "King of Critics," a biography of George Saintsbury (1845-1933), an English literary critic and historian, published by the University of Michigan Press this month. Going beyond the life of Saintsbury, the book is a portrait of the literary scene of Victorian-Edwardian England.
        Professor Jones joined Queens College as an instructor in 1939 and became a full professor in 1970. She spent 33 years on the faculty, including five as head of the English Department and one as a visiting professor of English at the University of Leicester, England.
        After her retirement, she became the owner of the Anglophile Antiques shop in Dorset.
        Professor Jones is survived by a brother, Dr. Edward R. Richardson of Dallas, and Lake St. Catherine, Vt. Her husband, Prof. Ernest Van B. Jones, died in 1966.
