        Joann Thompson, a New York City health-care advocate and an advocate for social and religious causes, died on Thursday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. She was 59 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She died after a short illness, friends said.
        Ms. Thompson organized and led the Health Action Resource Center since 1984. She was also a founder in 1979 of the Religious Committee on the New York City Health Crisis, of which she was executive director.
        Among the issues her organizations focused on were reductions in government aid to health programs, health care for the poor, infant mortality, the spread of AIDS and tuberculosis epidemics, sickness among the homeless and the shortages of nurses and of treatment for drug addiction.
        Born in Tifton, Ga., Ms. Thompson grew up in Austin, Tex. In 1956 she graduated from the University of Texas at Austin. There she worked with the Faith and Life Community, an ecumenical, interracial program of religious action in civil rights and other social issues.
        After studying at Harvard Divinity School and Princeton Theological Seminary, she served on the faculty of the Ecumenical Institute in Chicago for 10 years.
        Then she worked for the Young Women's Christian Association in St. Louis, New York City and San Francisco in programs for youth and community relations. In 1973 she became an administrator at the National Hemophilia Foundation in New York.
        There are no immediate survivors.
