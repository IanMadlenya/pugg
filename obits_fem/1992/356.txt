        Estelle Bauer, who practiced law for more than 50 years, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91.
        She died of pneumonia, said her daughter, Dr. Joyce Brothers, the psychologist and television personality.
        Mrs. Bauer and her husband were partners in the Manhattan law firm that carried his name, Morris K. Bauer. She retired after his death in 1979.
        Besides their law practice, the Bauers were associate producers with Alexander H. Cohen and Joseph Kipness of several Broadway productions in the 1950's.
        Mrs. Bauer, a native New Yorker, graduated from Brooklyn Law School.
        Besides her daughter Joyce, Mrs. Bauer is survived by another daughter, Elaine Goldsmith of Somerset, N.J.; a brother, Irving Rapaport of Los Angeles; four grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.
