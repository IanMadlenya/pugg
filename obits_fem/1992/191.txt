        Barbara Dalton Wainwright, a vice president of Manufacturers Hanover Trust, died on Tuesday at her home in Ossining, N.Y. She was 44 years old.
        She died of complications from cancer, said her husband, Harris E. Wainwright Jr.
        Mrs. Wainwright, who had been with Manufacturers since 1976, was vice president for corporate personnel. She was a trustee of Regents College in Albany, which enables adults to pursue college degrees while still working.
        In 1982, she was the banking industry representative to the Council to the New York State Board of Regents National Program on Noncollegiate Sponsored Instruction. That body examined the effectiveness of college-level courses for working adults and led to the establishment of Regents College.
        She is survived by her husband, Harris, and her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Loring D. Dalton of Naples, Fla.
