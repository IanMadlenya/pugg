        Kathleen (Kitty) Godfree, a two-time Wimbledon singles champion, died today. She was 96 years old.
        Her death was announced by officals of Wimbledon, the prestigious grass-court tennis tournament whose 1992 edition will start on Monday. Mrs. Godfree had been living in a nursing home in her native London for many years and died of the effects of old age, tournament officials said.
        Mrs. Godfree, then Kitty McKane, was the only woman to beat Helen Wills at Wimbledon. She defeated the eight-time Wimbledon champion in the 1924 final, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4. Five Doubles Titles
        She married Leslie Godfree, the captain of England's Wightman Cup Team, in 1926. As Kitty Godfree, she won her second Wimbledon title in 1926, beating Lili de Alvarez of Spain, 6-2, 4-6, 6-3.
        Mrs. Godfree also won five Grnd Slam doubles championships, all with different partners. She won the Wimbledon mixed-doubles titles in 1924 with J. Brian Gilbert, defeating her future husband and Dorothy Shepherd Barron in the final. In 1926, she teamed with Leslie Godfree to win at Wimbledon again. She also captured three doubles titles at the United States championships, two in women's, in 1923 and 1927, and one in mixed (1925).
        Mrs. Godfree was one of the first emale players to move to the net and use the volley to good advantate. An all-round athlete, she also excelled at ice skating, lacrosse, cricket and croquet.
        During her tennis career, she also won five Olympic medals: one gold, two silver and two bronze. The gold medal came in women's doubles with Winifred McNair at the 1920 Summer Games in Antwerp, Belgium. Honored at Wimbledon
        Mrs. Godfree was a regular visitor to Wimbledon and in 1989 became the first woman to be elected a vice president of the All England Club, where the tournament is played.
        In 1986, a party to mark her 90th birthday party was held at Wimbldeon, and she was given the honor of presenting Martina Navratilova with the women's singles trophy. She also attended the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, the first since 1924 to include tennis as a medal sport, as a link with past Games. She continued to play tennis into her 90's.
        Leslie Godfree, who became a well-known tennis coach, writer and umpire, died in 1972.
        Mrs. Godfree is survived by two sons, David and Martin.
