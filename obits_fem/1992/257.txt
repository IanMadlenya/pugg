        Amelia Lobsenz, a public-relations executive who ran her own firm in Manhattan for the last 36 years, died on Tuesday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 70 years old and lived in Old Brookville, L.I., and Manhattan.
        She died of cancer, said her daughter, Kay Abrahams.
        A native of Greensboro, N.C., Ms. Lobsenz graduated from Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Ga., and became one of the first women to rise into the executive ranks of her profession.
        She formed Lobsenz Public Relations in 1956; it became Lobsenz-Stevens Inc. in 1975. At the time of her death she was board chairwoman and chief executive of the firm, which counts American Home Products, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Procter & Gamble among its clients.
        Besides her daughter, a Manhattan resident, Ms. Lobsenz is survived by her husband, Dr. Harry Abrahams; a son, Michael Lobsenz of Boyds, Md., and three grandchildren.
