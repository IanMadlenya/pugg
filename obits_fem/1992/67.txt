        Marjorie McKeown Clay, widow of Gen. Lucius D. Clay, commander of American forces in Europe after World War II, died of pneumonia on Saturday at Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington. She was 94 years old and lived in McLean, Va.
        Mrs. Clay, a graduate of Barnard College, was living with her husband in Berlin in 1948 when one of the cold war's worst crises developed. A Soviet land blockade cut off the divided city, leading to the American airlift that supplied West Berliners with food and fuel for 327 days. As part of that effort, Mrs. Clay, a longtime volunteer for children's and other charitable causes, organized Operation Vittles, in which supply planes dropped parachutes bearing packets of candy for West Berlin's children.
        General Clay died in 1978.
        Mrs. Clay is survived by two sons, both retired generals, Lucius D. Clay Jr. of the Air Force, a resident of Alexandria, Va., and Frank B. Clay of the Army, who lives in Chevy Chase, Md.; seven grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.
