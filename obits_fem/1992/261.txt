        Bernice Gera, the first female umpire in professional baseball, died of kidney cancer Wednesday in Memorial Hospital West in Pembroke Pines, Fla. She was 61 years old.
        In 1972, Mrs. Gera, who fought in courtrooms for the preceding five years to achieve her goal, gained national attention when she umpired a Class A minor league game between the Geneva Rangers and the Auburn Phillies of the New York-Penn League.
        Mrs. Gera resigned after the game, saying she became disenchanted with umpiring when the other umpires refused to cooperate with her on the field.
        "Bernice would always say, 'I could beat them in the courts, but I can't beat them on the field,' " Steve Gera, her husband, said. No woman has ever umpired in the major leagues.
        Besides her husband, Mrs. Gera is survived by two brothers and two sisters.
