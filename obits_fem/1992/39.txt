        Dorothy Uris, a Broadway and Hollywood actress and voice teacher known professionally as Dorothy Tree, died yesterday at the Actor's Fund Home in Englewood, N.J. She was 85 years old.
        She died of heart failure, said her son, Joseph Uris of Manhattan.
        Mrs. Uris, who was born in Brooklyn, started her acting career in the late 1920's by playing a succession of parlor maids on Broadway. Her best-known film roles were the mother of Knute Rockne (played by Pat O'Brien) in "Knute Rockne: All American" (1940), and Louis Calhern's invalid wife in "The Asphalt Jungle" (1950). Mrs. Uris was also a founding member of the Screen Actor's Guild.
        Educated at Cornell and Teachers College of Columbia University, she taught voice and English diction at the Mannes College of Music and the Manhattan School of Music.
        She published four books, including "Everybody's Book of Better Speaking" and "To Sing in English."
        In addition to her son, she is survived by a sister, Mimi Shapiro of Manhattan.
