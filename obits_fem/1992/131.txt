        Deane Marks Lee, a longtime resident of White Plains, N.Y. who was active in several Westchester County charities, died yesterday at White Plains Hospital. She was 74.
        Mrs. Lee died of lung cancer, said Heidi Bulow, one of her grandchildren.
        Mrs. Lee and her late husband, Burt Lee, had lived in White Plains from the late 1940's to 1976, when they moved to St. Thomas, V.I. During those years she was an active supporter of Blythedale Children's Hospital in White Plains, the Westchester County Parents and Teachers Association, and of the United Way of Westchester. In St. Thomas, Mrs. Lee was a supporter of the Navy League.
        Mrs. Lee is survived by three children, Judith L. Bulow, of New Rochelle, N.Y.; Thomas M. Lee of Woodland Hills, Calif.; and Catherine L. Schmid of St. Thomas, V.I., and six grandchildren.
