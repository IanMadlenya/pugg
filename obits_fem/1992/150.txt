        Theodora K. Sklover, a former director of the Governor's Office of Motion Picture and Television Development who worked to broaden public access to film and television, died May 11 at her home in Manhattan. She was 53 years old.
        Ms. Sklover died as a result of jumping out of her apartment window, Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner said, in what the Medical Examiner ruled yesterday as a suicide.
        Ms. Sklover developed an interest in media from studying dance and drama at Bennington College and using television as a teaching tool for preschoolers at the Bank Street College of Education in Manhattan.
        Her interest led to efforts to use television teaching on a wider scale and ultimately led her in the late 1960's to organize Open Channel, a nonprofit organization that lobbied for community access to cable systems and public programming. Ms. Sklover soon came to be recognized as an authority on public programming and was a consultant to several cities on how to set up public-access channels.
        In 1979 Ms. Sklover created the state's office of film and television, the purpose of which was to entice filmmakers to include other sites in New York State besides New York City. She helped bring film and television productions worth more than $800 million to the state.
        Ms. Sklover is survived by a sister, Marcia Kleinman, and a brother, Stanley Klein, both of New York City.
