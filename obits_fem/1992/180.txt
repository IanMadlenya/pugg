        The Rev. Page E. Smith Bigelow, one of the first women to be ordained in the Episcopal Church, died Wednesday in St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J. She was 69 years old and lived in Maplewood, N.J.
        She died of cardiac arrest after a lengthy illness, her family said.
        A graduate of Wells College and the General Theological Seminary in New York City, she was ordained in January 1977 after spending two years as a deacon. She served as a priest in the city's Episcopal Church Center, then as a vicar in West Milford, N.J. For the past six years her home parish had been St. George's Episcopal Church in the Diocese of Newark.
        She is survived by her husband, William S.; a daughter, Page E., also of Maplewood; two sons, John O. 3d of Maplewood and William S. Jr. of Lebanon Township, N.J.; a sister, Thalia B. Husted of Mantoloking, N.J., and one grandchild.
