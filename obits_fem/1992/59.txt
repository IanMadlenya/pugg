        Anne Pappenheimer Forbes, a noted endocrinology researcher and clinician, died on Tuesday at her home in Milton, Mass. She was 80 years old.
        She died of Hodgkin's disease, her family said.
        Dr. Forbes was chosen in 1939 as the associate of Dr. Fuller Albright, the chief of endocrinology at the Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital.
        They and their colleagues helped develop endocrinology. She participated in the identification of many diseases, including Forbes-Albright Syndrome, a pituitary gland ailment.
        She became a professor at the medical school and a doctor at the hospital, where she helped create the Ovarian Dysfunction Clinic.
        She worked with several hospitals in Paris in 1954 and 1955 and taught at the Pahlevi University in Shiraz, Iran, from 1967 to 1969.
        After retiring in 1980, she took up gardening and raising ponies and sheep, shearing the wool herself and spinning and dyeing it by hand.
        Dr. Forbes was born in New York City. She graduated from Radcliffe College in 1932 and the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1936 and interned at Johns Hopkins Hospital from 1936 to 1938.
        Surviving are her husband, William H.; three daughters, Beatrice F. Manz of Milton and Andrea F. Schoenfeld and Elise F. Pachter, both of Washington; two sons, Peter M. of Milton and Anthony W. of Belmont, Mass.; eight grandchildren, and two brothers, Alwin M. Pappenheimer of Watertown, Mass., and John R. Pappenheimer of Cambridge, Mass.
