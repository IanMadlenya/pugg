        Dr. Dorothy Dinnerstein, a feminist author and professor emeritus of psychology at Rutgers University-Newark, died on Thursday in Englewood, N.J. She was 69 and lived in Leonia.
        She died in a single-car accident, her daughter, Naomi Miller, reported.
        Beyond the Rutgers community, Dr. Dinnerstein was best known for her book "The Mermaid and the Minotaur" (Harper & Row, 1976). It became a classic in women's-studies departments in the United States and abroad and was translated into seven languages. A scholarly work, it examined the underlying reasons for people's acceptance of gender-role playing.
        "The book had an enormous impact on the women's movement," said Marie M. Collins, professor of French at Rutgers-Newark and founder of its women's studies department. "She worked from within the Freudian mode and made an important statement about the responsibility of men to raise children from birth."
        Dr. Dinnerstein was born in New York City, graduated from Brooklyn College and earned her Ph.D. in psychology at the New School for Social Research.
        Her principal teaching affiliation was with Rutgers-Newark where she was on the faculty for 30 years until her retirement three years ago.
        In addition to her daughter, a resident of Middletown, N.Y., Dr. Dinnerstein is survived by two stepdaughters, June Lehrman of Los Angeles, and Nina Lehrman Davis, who lives in India.
