        Stella Roman, a soprano who sang with the Metropolitan Opera Company, died on Wednesday at Mt. Sinai Hospital. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She died of respiratory failure, said her son, Flaviu Romanul of Boston. Miss Roman was known for her interpretations of the great Italian spinto roles, including Aida, which she sang at her Metropolitan Opera debut in 1941, Tosca, Mimi in "La Boheme," Amelia in "Un Ballo in Maschera" and Desdemona in "Otello." She also appeared in German operas and was chosen by Richard Strauss to sing the role of the Empress at the Italian premiere of his "Frau Ohne Schatten" at La Scala in 1940.
        She was born in Cluj, Romania, and studied in Bucharest and in Italy, where she made her formal debut in 1932. She became a member of the Rome Opera four years later, and sang in Florence, Berlin and Salzburg, Austria, and in many other European cities. She portrayed Aida in Cairo. In her 10 seasons with the Metropolitan Opera, she appeared in 126 performances, singing 13 roles. She also sang with the San Francisco, Cincinnati and other American opera companies, and appeared frequently in Brazil, Cuba, Mexico and Puerto Rico.
        In addition to her son, she is survived by four grandchildren.
