        Katrina Haslip, a former New York State prison inmate who became an advocate for increased governmental and private support for women with AIDS, died yesterday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 33 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Ms. Haslip died of complications from AIDS, said Theresa McGovern, director of the H.I.V. Law Project of the AIDS Service Center of Lower Manhattan.
        Ms. Haslip was a native of Niagara Falls, N.Y. Her H.I.V. was diagnosed while she was in the Bedford Hills Correctional Center in the late 1980's after she was convicted of picking pockets. She founded two organizations, ACE, for AIDS Counseling and Education Program, and, after her release in 1990, its sister program, ACE-OUT, to help women with AIDS in and out of prison do more for themselves.
        She also joined with other AIDS organizations, including Life Force, a Brooklyn-based program, the Brooklyn Task Force on AIDS, and the Upper Manhattan Task Force on AIDS, which worked to press the Federal Government to expand its efforts to fight AIDS among women.
        Because of her efforts, the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last month announced plans to expand its definition of the disease to include more illnesses that affect women with AIDS.
