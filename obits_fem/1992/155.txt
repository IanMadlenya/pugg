        Dr. Mary Ann Spencer Pulaski, a retired children's psychologist, lecturer and author, died on Saturday at Glen Cove Hospital on Long Island. She was 75 years old and lived in Port Washington, L.I.
        Her family said she died after a long illness.
        Dr. Pulaski graduated from Wellesley College in 1938 and earned a Ph.D. in child psychology at City University of New York three decades later. In between, she worked in merchandising and advertising and as an editorial assistant at Glamour magazine.
        While her children were in school, she earned master's degrees in education and school psychology and taught at the Buckley Country Day School in Roslyn, L.I. From 1967 until her retirement in 1979, she served as a psychologist in the Herricks public school system in New Hyde Park, L.I.
        Dr. Pulaski was the author of many articles, including "Understanding Piaget." A revised edition of it was published by Harper & Row Publishers Inc. in 1980. She lectured widely and taught at Hofstra University, Adelphi University and Queens College of the City University of New York.
        Dr. Pulaski is survived by her husband of 52 years, Charles A. Pulaski; a son, Charles A. Jr., of Tempe, Ariz.; a daughter, Elizabeth Mertens of Glen Head, L.I., and three grandchildren.
