        Barbara Reach, a former mayoral assistant in New York City and a housing and city planning expert, died on Sunday at New York Hospital. She was 75 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She died of kidney failure, said a friend, Eleanor Stier, who lived with her.
        Ms. Reach was born in New York and attended private schools in the city and in Switzerland. A housing specialist with the Community Service Society, a civic group, she was appointed by Mayor Robert F. Wagner in 1965 as chairman of the Citizens' Advisory Committee of the Housing and Redevelopment Board. Mayor John V. Lindsay named her in 1969 to a board that oversaw the city's rent-control law.
        In 1974, Mayor Abraham D. Beame named Ms. Reach one of four mayoral assistants -- believed to be the first woman to serve in that capacity -- and an adviser on housing matters. She helped to organize the city's Commission on the Status of Women and later was appointed to the staff of the City Planning Commission.
        She was cited by the National Park Service for helping to preserve parkland in the New York metropolitan region and establishing the Gateway National Park recreation area.
        Since 1986, she was a lay member of the state Supreme Court Appellate Division's Disciplinary Committee, the unit that reviews misconduct complaints against lawyers.
        Ms. Reach was divorced in 1960 from James Reach, a playwright and author, who died in 1970.
        She is survived by a sister, Mildred Bright of Northridge, Calif., and a stepdaughter, Carol Reach of Van Nuys, Calif.
