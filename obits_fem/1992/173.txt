        Alta Jablow, professor emeritus of anthropology at Brooklyn College, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was was 72 years old.
        Professor Jablow died of natural causes, said her daughter, Lisa Jablow.
        Professor Jablow took particular interest in how societies used folk tales to pass their histories and customs from one generation to the next. She was the author or co-author of six books on Africa and African folk tales and of children's books. She also examined the role of women in different societies.
        One of her books, "The Africa That Never Was," which was written with a Brooklyn College colleague, Dorothy Hammond, examined the British experience in Africa and was published by Twain Press in 1970. Another was "Yes and No: The Intimate Folklore on Africa," which was published in 1961 by Horizon Press.
        Her interest in folklore sprang from her early interest in dance as a form of telling folk tales. In the 1940's, she was a member of the Martha Graham dance company.
        Born in Weehawken, N.J., Professor Jablow earned a bachelor's degree from New York University in 1940 and a doctorate from Columbia University in 1963.
        She joined the Brooklyn College faculty, where her husband was also on the anthropology faculty, in 1947 as an adjunct professor and became a full-time faculty member in 1965. She retired in 1980.
        Professor Jablow is survived by her husband, Joseph, and her daughter, Lisa, also of Manhattan.
