        Elisabeth Marton, an agent who represented foreign playwrights in the United States and American playwrights overseas, died at her home in Manhattan on Monday. She was 90 years old.
        Ms. Marton died of a stroke, said Morton D. Stone, her companion.
        She was born in Budapest, the daughter of an international copyright lawyer, Sandor Marton, who was a pioneering literary agent with clients including Sinclair Lewis, Dorothy Thompson and Thornton Wilder.
        After being imprisoned by the pro-Nazi regime in Hungary during World War II, Ms. Marton came to the United States, and by 1953 began to work as a theatrical agent for European writers in collaboration with her brother, George, who was living in Paris.
        She was also active in arranging for foreign productions of American plays and musicals. Among the Broadway shows she sent around the world were "Man of La Mancha," "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," "Same Time, Next Year," "Agnes of God" and the Pulitzer Prize-winning " 'Night, Mother."
        Her most notable Broadway hit was the musical "La Cage aux Folles" in 1983. Ms. Marton represented the French author of the original play, Jean Poiret. She also represented the original works on which "Grand Hotel" and "She Loves Me" were based.
        Ms. Marton came to public attention in 1985 when she represented the estate of a young Hungarian woman who joined the British Army in World War II and parachuted into Yugoslavia to help rescue downed British fliers and Jews from the Nazis. Eventually, she was captured, tortured and executed. Her story was turned into the play "Hannah Senesh," by David Schechter.
        Ms. Marton is survived by three nieces, Tonda Marton-Beyer of Manhattan; Marie Mullholland of Portland, Ore., and Eva Lafer of Los Angeles.
        A memorial service is to be announced.
