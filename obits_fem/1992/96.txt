        Leueen MacGrath, an actress and playwright who co-wrote the 1955 Broadway musical "Silk Stockings" with her third husband, George S. Kaufman, died on Friday at her home in London. She was 77 years old.
        Her stepdaughter, Anne Kaufman Schneider, said Miss MacGrath died after complications of a stroke last November.
        As a playwright, Miss MacGrath collaborated on three Broadway shows with Mr. Kaufman while they were married: "The Small Hours" (1951), "Fancy Meeting You Again" (1952) and "Silk Stockings," a lampoon of life in the Soviet Union that starred Don Ameche and Hildegarde Neff. The show had music and lyrics by Cole Porter and a book by Mr. Kaufman, Miss MacGrath and Abe Burrows.
        Miss MacGrath (her name was pronunced lew-EEN mac-GRAW) made her Broadway debut in 1948 in a starring role in "Edward, My Son," by Robert Morley and Noel Langley, after first performing in the play in London. She was also cast in the 1949 Hollywood movie version of the play starring Spencer Tracy and Deborah Kerr.
        Miss MacGrath's many other New York successes included roles in "The Enchanted" (1950), "The Potting Shed" (1957), "The Love of Four Colonels" (1959), "Farewell, Farewell Eugene" (1960), "Ghosts" (1961) and "A Tribute to Lili Lamont" (1976).
        Her screen credits also included "Pygmalion" and "Three Cases of Murder."
        In 1976, when Miss MacGrath appeared as the grand actress Irina Arkadina in Chekhov's "Seagull" at the Manhattan Theater Club, Clive Barnes, writing in The New York Times, said her work was "one of the best individual performances on view anywhere in New York at present."
        Miss MacGrath's final London appearances were in "Voyage Round My Father," opposite Alec Guinness, in 1966, and in "A Bequest to the Nation," with Zoe Caldwell, in 1970.
        Miss MacGrath was born on July 3, 1914, in London. A graduate of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, she made her debut in a West End production of "Beggars in Hell." During World War II she performed for the troops in an acting unit with Emlyn Williams.
        She was married and divorced five times. Her husbands were Christopher Burn, Desmond Davis, Mr. Kaufman, Stephen Goodyear and Stephen Quinto.
        She is survived by a sister, Eila Phillips, who lives in England, and Ms. Schneider, of New York City.
