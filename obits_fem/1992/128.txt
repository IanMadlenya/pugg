        Mae Clarke, a film actress best remembered for the scene in which James Cagney pushed a grapefruit in her face in the 1931 gangster movie "Public Enemy," died on Wednesday at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif. She was 81 years old and lived in Woodland Hills.
        She died of cancer, said Louella Benson, a hospital spokeswoman.
        Miss Clarke, the daughter of a movie-theater organist, originally was named Mary Klotz. She was born in Philadelphia and grew up in Atlantic City, N.J., where she danced in amateur musicals and caught the eye of Earl Lindsay, a dance producer. He arranged for her to dance in New York City, at the Strand Roof and at the Everglades Club, which led to appearances on Broadway. A screen test in 1929 led to several film roles for Fox Movietone.  In Several Films Yearly
        After seeing her performance in "The Front Page" in 1931, Carl Laemmle Jr., the head of Universal Pictures, cast Miss Clarke in the lead of "Waterloo Bridge." She also appeared that year in "Frankenstein" with Boris Karloff.
        Throughout the 1930's, she appeared in several films yearly, including "Nana" (1934) and "Great Guy" (1936), which paired her again with Mr. Cagney.
        While under contract to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, she appeared in minor roles in "Annie Get Your Gun" (1950), "The Great Caruso" (1951), "Because of You" (1952) and Singin' in the Rain" (1952).
        Among her other movies were "Flying Tigers" (1942), "Magnificent Obsession" (1954) and "Thoroughly Modern Millie" (1967). Her most recent role was a bit part in "Watermelon Man" (1970).
