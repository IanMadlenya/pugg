        Edith R. Peterson, a medical researcher into cell cultures at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, died on Saturday at Horton Memorial Hospital in Middletown, N.Y. She was 78 years old and had moved to Middletown two years ago from the Bronx.
        She died of a stroke, said Art Oshins, a spokesman at Albert Einstein.
        Ms. Peterson, who was born in Brooklyn, had been associated with the college since 1966. She was known for several innovations in her specialty, organotypic cultures -- cultures typical of an organ -- of nerve and muscle tissues.
        The college reported that one important contribution led to the recognition that myelin, the insulating sheath around nerve cells, can be grown in test tubes. The finding, which she made in 1948, aided multiple-sclerosis research, since the destruction of myelin causes that disease, the college said.
        Ms. Peterson graduated from Barnard College in 1937 with a major in zoology, and earned an M.A. in that discipline at Columbia University two years later.
        Ms. Peterson is survived by her husband, Charles; a son, Wesley; a daughter, Ronnie, and three grandchildren, all of Middletown.
