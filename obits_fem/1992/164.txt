        Minnie Mazer Nathanson, a philanthropist involved in the founding of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 83 years old.
        She died of lymphatic cancer, said her daughter, Bobbie Abrams of Manhattan.
        At the time of her death, she was a member of the boards of the Brooklyn Museum and the Jewish Museum and chairman of the B'nai B'rith Hillel-Jewish Association for College Youth.
        She and her three brothers and a sister jointly donated the funds for the construction, in the mid-1950's, of the first dormitory at Albert Einstein College. Mrs. Nathanson and her siblings gave the Mazer Building in memory of their father, Abraham Mazer, who died in 1952. Mr. Mazer was a founder and chairman of the Hudson Pulp and Paper Company, based in New York City and later sold to Georgia-Pacific.
        Over the years, Mrs. Nathanson was also a vice president and trustee of the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, an officer of the Council of Jewish Federations and a member of the board of the New York Association for New Americans.
        She was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Adelphi College.
        Her husband, Dr. Louis Nathanson, a radiologist and member of the Albert Einstein College faculty, died in 1968.
        In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a son, Dr. Noel Nathanson of Great Neck, L.I.; a sister, Anna Lopin, and a brother, William Mazer, both of Manhattan; five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.
