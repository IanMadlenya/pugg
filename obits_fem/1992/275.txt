        Bertha Levin, a longtime supporter of Jewish causes in New York City and Israel, died on Thursday at her home in Jerusalem. She was 98 years old.
        She had been suffering from pneumonia, a family spokeswoman said.
        In New York Mrs. Levin was a founding member of the Young Israel Movement and a pioneer member of Hadassah who worked with its founder, Henrietta Szold, during World War I. She moved to Israel in 1961, where she served on the Committee to Beautify Jerusalem.
        Born Bertha Lebendiger, she was a native of New York City. As a young woman she was a suffragette and was the first woman admitted to membership in the New York Credit Managers Association, in the World War I era.  For 25 years she was married to Harry Levin, a lawyer who died in 1945.
        She is survived by two daughters, Tova Solter of Ramat Chen, Israel, and Ora Zohar of Jerusalem; three sons, David, of Manhattan, Ezra, of the Bronx and Jonathan, of Bethesda, Md.; 13 grandchildren, and 15 great-grandchildren.
