        Frances Brice Stark, Fanny Brice's daughter, who became a philanthropist and a well-known figure in show business circles, died on Sunday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 72 years old.
        She died after several strokes and heart failure, a family spokesman said.
        Mrs. Stark was born in Huntington, L.I., the daughter of Nicky Arnstein and Miss Brice, whose radio and stage career was portrayed in "Funny Girl."
        As a teen-ager, the daughter became an accomplished horsewoman, winning awards at Eastern horse shows and the National Horse Show. After graduating from the Dalton School in New York, she moved to California with her mother and often accompanied her on stage tours.
        For nearly 52 years she was married to the Hollywood producer Ray Stark, who produced the movie "Funny Girl" in 1968. Together they made contributions to many charitable causes and were the hosts of many social and business events. She was a regular on lists of best-dressed women.
        Surviving are her husband; a daughter, Wendy Stark Morrissey, and a brother, William Brice, both of Los Angeles, and one grandchild. A son, Peter, died in 1970.
