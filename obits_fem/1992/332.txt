        Allison Assante, a composer and songwriter and supporter of the homeless, died on Friday at her daughter Paula Blasband's home in Manhattan. She was in her early 70's and lived in Manhattan.
        She died of a heart attack and stroke, her family said.
        Mrs. Assante worked for Duke Ellington, and among her better-known compositions were "Goodbye, My Love," "Lonely River" and "Everywhere I Go." She was a member of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers and the Songwriters Guild.
        Early in her career she studied fashion design, was a model and appeared in Vogue. She became interested in jazz in Chicago during the 1940's.
        Long active in behalf of the homeless, she composed and produced a musical, "Heartbeat of the Street," to raise money.
        She was also a board member of the Sarah Herzog Hospital in Jerusalem.
        Mrs. Assante was born in Lafayette, Ind. Her first marriage ended in divorce. Her husband of 34 years, Mario Assante, a physician, died several years ago.
        In addition to her daughter Paula Blasband, she is survived by her daughter Julia Mason of Manhattan; a brother, Arthur Mavity of Indianapolis; two sisters, Marion Greenwald of Indianapolis and Elizabeth Caraway of Watertown, N.Y.; six grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.
