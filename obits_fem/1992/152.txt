        Dr. Beth Anspach Bernstein, a psychoanalyst for children, died on May 8 at her home in Manhattan. She was 76 years old and died of breast cancer, her family said.
        Dr. Bernstein had a longtime private practice in Manhattan until she retired a year ago because of illness.
        She was born in Chicago and grew up in Manhattan. After graduating from Hunter College, she earned a master's degree in English at Yale. Turning to psychology, she earned a master's degree at New York University and a doctorate from the University of California.
        Her husband of nearly 50 years, Dr. Benedict J. Bernstein, also a psychoanalyst, died last year.
        She is survived by a daughter, Carola Chase of the Bronx; two sons, Jonathan of Manhattan and Michael of Chicago; a sister, Jean Farr of British Columbia, Canada, and five grandchildren.
