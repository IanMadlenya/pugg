        Mai-mai Sze, a painter and author, died in New York Hospital in Manhattan on Thursday. She was 82 years old.
        Ms. Sze died of throat cancer, said Jean B. Angell, a close friend who was her lawyer.
        The daughter of a former Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Ms. Sze was born in China but was educated at the National Cathedral School in Washington and graduated from Wellesley College in 1931.
        After college, she became a successful landscape painter, and her works were exhibited at shows in New York, London and Paris. Her drawing of Eugene O'Neill was used on book jackets, on the theater program for his play "The Iceman Cometh" and on the cover of Newsweek magazine.
        In 1936, she appeared as a narrator called the "Honorable Reader" in the Broadway hit "Lady Precious Stream," a love story set in ancient China.
        From 1937 until the end of World War II, she lectured on China and organized the first Chinese War Relief Committee in New York. During this period she also wrote a column for The New York Post and contributed articles to a number of national magazines.
        Ms. Sze began publishing both fiction and nonfiction books in 1945. These included "Echo of a Cry" (1945), "Silent Children" (1948), a novel about dispossessed children in an imaginary country, and a philosophical work, "The Tao of Painting" (1960).
        Ms. Sze is survived by three sisters, Julia Sze Bailey of Manhattan, Betty Sze O'Neill of Poughkeepsie and Alice Sze Wang of Cambridge, Mass., and a brother, Dr. Szeming Sze of Pennsylvania and Florida.
