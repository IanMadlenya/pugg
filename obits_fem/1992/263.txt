        Marge R. Manderson, a program officer with the Southern Regional Council for more than 35 years, died Wednesday at her home in Atlanta. She was 64.
        Miss Manderson died of bone cancer, said Ellen Spears, a spokeswoman for the council.
        A native of Atlanta, Miss Manderson joined the Southern Regional Council, a civil rights advocacy group, in 1954, shortly after the United States Supreme Court decided the Brown v. Board of Education school desegregation case. Steve Suitts, the council's executive director, said she did so because she believed it important that whites work for school desegregation.
        Miss Manderson is survived by her mother, Margaret Freeman, of Atlanta.
