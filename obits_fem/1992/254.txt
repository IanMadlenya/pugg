        Helen A. Wilson, a retired executive for international refugee and development agencies, died Friday at her house in Washington. She was 79 years old.
        She died of complications from emphysema, said Marion Connell, a colleague and friend.
        Reared in the Brooklyn Heights section of Brooklyn, Miss Wilson graduated from Barnard College and earned a master's degree from the Fordham University School of Social Work. She then worked for adoption and foster-care agencies in New York City before joining the International Social Service, which works to reunite families separated by war.
        After World War II, the United Nations' Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Administration sent Miss Wilson to Algeria and Italy, where she lived in the refugee camps she administered. After holding various positions with international agencies in Switzerland and North Africa, she joined the Peace Corps when it was founded, serving as deputy director of program development and coordination and later becoming acting director of private and international organizations.
        In 1965, she joined the United States Agency for International Development, filling a number of posts before her retirement in 1977.
        Miss Wilson leaves no immediate survivors.
