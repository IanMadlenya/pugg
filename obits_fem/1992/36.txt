        Princess Brown Thrush, a Matinnecock Indian who fought for the rights of her tribe, died on Jan. 20 at Booth Memorial Medical Center in Queens. She was 80 years old and lived at the Matinnecock-Tackapoosha tribal longhouse in Flushing.
        Princess Brown Thrush, whose Christian name was Lila E. Harding, died of cancer, said Chief Osceola Townsend, a cousin.
        She was descended from Chief Tackapoosha, the Grand Sachem of the tribe, who died in the 1700's. Before the arrival of Europeans, the Matinnecocks had roamed the North Shore of Long Island. Currently they number about 250 families.
        She was active in protests and territorial claims against the local, state and Federal governments in the 1950's and 1960's. The Matinnecocks still claim ownership of Flushing Meadows-Corona Park and Fort Totten in Queens, parts of North Hempstead and Caumsett State Park in Huntington.
        In one dispute, the tribe forced a hospital to abandon plans to expand its buildings onto a sacred burial ground in Manhasset.
        She was also active in protests at the 1964 World's Fair in Flushing Meadows, asserting that American Indians and their history were being ignored by the international event being held on their ancestral lands.
        She was retired and had worked most of her life in food service at city public schools in Queens, Chief Townsend said.
        There are no immediate survivors.
