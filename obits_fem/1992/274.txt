        Louise Field Cooper, a novelist and short-story writer, died last Friday at her home in Woodbridge, Conn. She was 87 years old.
        She died of pancreatic cancer, said her son Peter Brintnall Cooper.
        Mrs. Cooper was born in Hartford and graduated from Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn. Her short stories appeared frequently in The New Yorker from 1938 to 1962. Her 10 novels included "The Lighted Box" (1942), "Summer Stranger" (1947) and "The Boys From Sharon" (1950). "Love and Admiration," a collection of her short stories, was published in 1944.
        In her fiction, Mrs. Cooper stayed close to home, concocting a delicate social satire from characters and settings familiar to her. "All I write about are the things I know myself, and I've never had very much happen to me," she once said in an interview. Eudora Welty wrote that "her touch is as light as it is sure, and as revealing as it is quiet."
        Mrs. Cooper's husband, James Wayne Cooper, a senior partner of the New Haven law firm of Tyler, Cooper & Alcorn, died in 1989.
        In addition to her son Peter, of Woodbridge, she is survived by another son, James Nicoll Cooper of Cambridge, Mass.; a daughter, Field McIntyre of London; eight grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.
