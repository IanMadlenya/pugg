        Anne G. Wilder, who led the expansion of Playwrights Horizons, a nonprofit developmental theater in Manhattan, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 63 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She died of a heart attack, her family said.
        Mrs. Wilder joined the Playwrights Horizons board in 1976 and was its chairwoman for the last 11 years. She helped raise money and guide the purchase of its building at 416 West 42d Street, which houses two theaters and administrative offices.
        The organization sponsored many productions, some of which moved to Off Broadway, including Christopher Durang's "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You," Jonathan Reynolds's "Geniuses" and Wendy Wasserstein's "Isn't It Romantic."
        Among the writers, composers and lyricists supported by Playwrights Horizons have been Ted Tally, A. R. Gurney, Alfred Uhry, James Lapine, William Finn and Albert Innaurato.
        Mrs. Wilder also produced two Off Broadway shows that received critical and popular note: "A . . . My Name Is Alice," a musical revue, and a trilogy of one-act plays, "Win/Lose/Draw."
        Before her involvement in the theater, Mrs. Wilder was a volunteer, lecturer, trainer and board member of the New York City School Volunteer program.
        She was born in Bayonne, N.J., and grew up in Englewood, N.J. She graduated from Connecticut College in 1950.
        She is survived by her husband, Robert C. Wilder; a daughter, Rachel W. Smeragliuolo of Baltimore; two sons, Clinton D., of San Francisco, and Robert D., of Washington; a sister, Doris Gould of Atlanta, and a granddaughter.
