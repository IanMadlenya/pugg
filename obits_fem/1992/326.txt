        Merline Foster, a health care worker and advocate for AIDS patients, died on Tuesday at her home in Boston. She was 46 years old.
        She died of complications from hepatitis and AIDS, her family said.
        Ms. Foster had said she acquired the diseases in a medical accident involving a broken test tube and needle puncture while drawing blood from a patient at Southwood Hospital in Norfolk, Mass. A suit she filed against the manufacturer of the medical equipment was settled out of court under undisclosed terms.
        Ms. Foster campaigned for better safety precautions to protect patients and health care workers and to find a cure and vaccine for AIDS.
        Surviving are her daughter, Sherry Quist of Boston; two brothers, James Foster of Westport, Mass., and Russell Foster of Rehobeth, Mass., and a sister, Barbara Marchand of Franklin, Mass.
