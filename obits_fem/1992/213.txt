        Sister Josephine Morgan, whose work as director of the Pius X School of Liturgical Music at Manhattanville College helped raise the standards of sacred music, died on Friday at Kenwood Convent of the Sacred Heart in Albany. She was 83 years old.
        She died of heart failure, said Sister Mary Lyman, the convent's pastoral care minister.
        Sister Morgan, who was born in New York City, entered the Society of the Sacred Heart in 1923. A decade later, she began teaching music at Manhattanville College, in Purchase, N.Y.
        During her tenure as director of the Pius X School from 1952 to 1969, she helped renew an interest in Gregorian chants and other forms of music used in the Roman Catholic liturgy. In 1961, Pope John XXIII cited the school for its role in improving the quality of liturgical music.
        From 1971 until her retirement in 1977, she served as superior of the Kenwood Convent, where she continued to live.
        She is survived by a brother, Arthur J. Morgan of Westhampton Beach, L.I.
