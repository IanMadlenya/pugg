        Lettie Gay Carson, who fought to save railroad service both in New York and Pennsylvania, died on Wednesday at her home in Newtown, Pa. She was 91 years old.
        She died of congestive heart failure, her daughter, Sally Carson, said.
        Mrs. Carson, who was born in Pike County, Ill., and graduated from the University of Illinois, came to New York in the early 1920's. From 1927 until 1933, she was director of the Home Institute of The New York Herald Tribune.
        In 1924, she married Gerald H. Carson, an advertising executive, who later wrote several books as a social historian, including "Cornflake Crusade."
        When the Carsons moved to a retirement home in Newtown, Pa., Mrs. Carson organized a group to preserve rail service in and around Philadelphia. Her husband died in 1990.
        Surviving in addition to her daughter are three grandchildren.
