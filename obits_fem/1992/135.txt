        Moira Dryer, an abstract artist known for working in glowing colors on sheets of plywood, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 34 years old.
        She died of cancer, said James McKinley, a friend.
        Ms. Dryer's distinctive painting method involved applying diaphanous washes of either casein or acrylic paint to big squares of wood, creating veiled, undulating patterns that could suggest an open landscape, the sea or a soft freehand tapestry. This process was inspired by the thin paint surfaces of the Italian Renaissance frescoes she saw on a trip to Florence in 1978. But her paintings rested firmly within the tradition of American postwar abstraction and related in particular to the work of Milton Avery, Morris Louis and the young Frank Stella.
        Ms. Dryer was born in Toronto, a daughter of Pegeen Synge, an architect, and Douglas Dryer, a professor of philosophy at the University of Toronto. She attended Sir George Williams University in Montreal and then transferred to the School of Visual Arts in New York City. There she studied with the painter Elizabeth Murray and graduated with honors in 1981. In January 1982 she married Victor Alzamora, a fellow student at the School of Visual Arts, who died in June 1983.
        Since the early 1980's, Ms. Dryer's work has been included in numerous group exhibitions in museums and galleries around the country. Her first solo exhibition was held in 1986 at the John Good Gallery in Manhattan, and there were subsequent solo shows at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, the Fred Hoffman Gallery in Santa Monica, Calif., and the Mario Diacono Gallery in Boston.
        She is survived by her father, Ellis Dryer of Toronto; a brother, Matthew, of Buffalo; a sister, Dr. Dagny Dryer Murray, of Prince Edward Island, Canada, and a grandfather, John L. Synge of Dublin.
