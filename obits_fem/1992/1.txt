        Mary Frances Rice, known as Sister Berenice of the Order of St. Ursula, a retired faculty member and trustee of the College of New Rochelle, died on Sunday at the Marian Residence in New Rochelle, N.Y. She was 89 years old.
        Sister Berenice was a member of the Ursuline Convent of St. Teresa, having entered the Ursuline Order in 1925. Three years later, she became an English instructor at her alma mater in New Rochelle, an independent women's college founded by the order in 1904. After earning a Ph.D. in psychology from Catholic University of America in 1938, she started the psychology department at New Rochelle and headed it from 1942 to 1967.
        She was an associate professor of psychology at Fordham University from 1967 to 1973, also serving as dean of St. Mary's Residence Hall for nuns doing graduate work at Fordham. She became a New Rochelle trustee in 1950, retired from the board in 1978 and was elected to emeritus status at the college in 1980. She then served as the accredited representative of the Federation of Catholic Universities at the United Nations.
        She is survived by two brothers, James O. Rice of Bronxville, N.Y., and Leo Rice of Cherry Hill, N.J., and a sister, Eleanor Rice Saunders of Philadelphia.
