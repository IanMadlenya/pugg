        Ruth Sleeper, a national leader in nursing education who helped raise academic standards for the nursing profession, died Thursday at her home in Braintree, Mass. She was 93.
        She died after a long illness, said the Massachusetts General Hospital, where she had been director of both the Nursing Service and School of Nursing from 1946 to 1966.
        Miss Sleeper was a past president of the National League of Nursing Education and the National League for Nursing.
        She helped lead the way in transforming nursing education by greatly expanding classroom instruction. She developed a curriculum that combined nine months of practical training with 28 months of academic classes.
        Miss Sleeper, a native of Manchester, N.H., started her own nursing career at Massachusetts General, where she earned a diploma at the age of 23. Later she earned bachelor's and master's degrees at Columbia University's Teachers College.
        She was an adviser to the State Department and was a representative to the Status of Women Commission at the United Nations. She was also an officer in the United Community Services, American Red Cross, International Council of Nurses and Nursing Advisory Council of the Veterans Administration.
        Although retired, Ms. Sleeper remained active professionally until her death, advising two nursing schools.
        She is survived by several nieces, grandnieces and grandnephews.
