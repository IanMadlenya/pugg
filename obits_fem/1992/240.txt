        Dr. LaDonne H. Schulman, a prominent researcher in advanced genetics at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 56 years old.
        The college said the cause of death was cancer.
        Dr. Schulman, a professor of developmental biology and cancer, was known for her work with transfer RNA, or tRNA -- molecules that complete the process of synthesizing proteins according to the DNA code. Before their discovery, Francis Crick, the Nobelist and a discoverer of DNA, had foreseen their existence as the "bilingual molecules" that understand the chemical languages of DNA and protein.
        As it turned out, each tRNA molecule bears one amino acid that it ultimately inserts into the growing protein at the proper location, as prescribed by the DNA sequence. Dr. Schulman's particular interest lay in the process of recognition by which tRNAs came to carry the correct amino acids.
        The hospital said she helped to demonstrate that enzymes rely on a particular section of the tRNA molecule -- the anticodon -- to match the right amino acids with their tRNA carriers. In the process, she found ways to test tRNA activity and showed why all proteins start with the same amino acid, methionine.
        LaDonne Heaton Schulman was born in Jacksonville, Fla., and graduated summa cum laude from Wheaton College before spending a year as a Fulbright scholar at Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany. She received M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in chemistry at Columbia University and did postdoctoral studies at New York University Medical Center in 1966.
        She joined Albert Einstein as an assistant professor in the Department of Developmental Biology and Cancer in 1968 and became a full professor 10 years later.
        Dr. Schulman is survived by her brother, Cherrill Paul Heaton of Gainesville, Fla.
