        Emily Sears Lodge Clark, the widow of Henry Cabot Lodge, the Senator and 1960 Republican Vice-Presidential nominee, died on Saturday at her home in Beverly, Mass. She was 86 years old.
        She died of lung cancer, said her son Henry Sears Lodge.
        Mrs. Clark married Forrester A. Clark, a retired investment banker, in 1987, two years after Mr. Lodge died.
        She was born in Beverly, the daughter of Henry F. Sears, a doctor, and grew up partly in France. Her schooling as a child came largely from tutors.
        She met Mr. Lodge at a debutante party in Boston, and they were married in 1926. She was at his side while Mr. Lodge was a Senator from Massachusetts, chief United States delegate to the United Nations, Ambassador to South Vietnam and Ambassador to West Germany.
        In addition to her husband, Mr. Clark, she is survived by two sons, George Cabot Lodge and Henry Sears Lodge, both of Beverly; 10 grandchildren, and 14 great-grandchildren.
