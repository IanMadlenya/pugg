        Ana Inez Astor, the former wife of Sir John Jacob Astor, died Friday at her home in London. She was 73 years old.
        Her family said she had died of natural causes but did not name a specific ailment.
        Mrs. Astor worked in theatrical costume and set design and was a contributing editor to Vogue magazine. Her interests included interior decorating and antiques, and she was an amateur painter.
        Mrs. Astor, also known by her nickname, Chiquita, traveled regularly to the United States and her native Argentina. She grew up in Argentina but moved to Paris with her family when her father, Miguel Angel Carcano, was appointed Argentine Ambassador to France.
        Her family followed French Government officials into exile in London after the Germans invaded in 1940.
        She met Sir John, a prominent landowner, and they were married in 1944. Sir John, now retired, was a Member of Parliament in the 1950's and was active in agriculture and in horse racing. They divorced in 1972.
        Surviving are her daughter, Stella Wilkinson of London; a son, Michael, of Cambridge; six grandchildren, and a sister, Stella Ednam of Argentina.
