        Tiki Freeman, who in the early 1970's became one of the first female cantors in the United States, died on Saturday at her home in Eastchester, N.Y. She was 69 years old.
        Mrs. Freeman died of cancer, said her husband, Joel.
        Mrs. Freeman was born in Brooklyn, to Elias Gilner, one of the founders of the Haganah, the defense force raised by Palestinian Jews during the British Mandate, and Violet Sandheim, who had been private secretary to Henrietta Szold, the founder of Hadassah, the women's Zionist and charitable organization.
        Mrs. Freeman's family emigrated to Palestine in the mid-1930's, returning in 1941 as war began to sweep over the area.
        Mrs. Freeman graduated from Brooklyn College in 1947. While raising a family, she built a singing career and her repertory ranged from operettas of Gilbert & Sullivan to folk songs and religious music. She was also a stage manager for many productions of Gilbert & Sullivan and other light operas for the Westchester Music Conservatory Opera Company.
        In addition to her husband, Mrs. Freeman is survived by a daughter, Gail Weed Westcott, of Simsbury, Conn.; two sons, Jonathan, of Yonkers, and Ethan, of London and Vienna; a brother, Rabbi Herbert Gilner of Chambersburg, Pa., and two grandchildren.
