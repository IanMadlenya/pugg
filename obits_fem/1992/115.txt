        Han Schroeder, an architect, interior designer and educator, died on March 20 in the Boerhaave Clinic in Amsterdam. She was 73 years old and lived in Richmond.
        She died after a short illness, said Janet De Cecilia, the coordinator of the interior design program at the New York Institute of Technology in Old Westbury, L.I., where Ms. Schroeder had taught.
        Ms. Schroeder was born in Utrecht, the Netherlands. Her family lived in Schroeder House, a landmark De Stilj house designed in 1924 by the architect Gerrit Rietveld, with whom Ms. Schroeder later worked, in collaboration with her mother, Truss Schroeder-Schraeder, an interior designer. From 1972 to 1987, Ms. Schroeder was the consulting architect for the restoration of the house, now a museum. Two of her drawings for the restoration are in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art.
        Before immigrating to the United States in the early 1960's, she had her own architecture and interior design office in Amsterdam. In 1964 she settled on Long Island to teach interior design at Adelphi University and the Parsons School of Design, and three years later she was appointed professor at the New York Institute of Technology. In 1981 she moved to Richmond, where she taught at Virginia Commonwealth University until retiring as professor emerita in 1988. She was one of the first women to have their work represented in the archives of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg, Va.
        She is survived by a brother, Binnert, of the Hague.
