        Thelma Saks Bradford Ingersoll, an artist and the widow of the editor and publisher Ralph A. Ingersoll, died on Saturday at her home in West Cornwall, Conn. She was 81 years old and died of kidney failure, a family spokesman said.
        Mrs. Ingersoll, who was born in Manhattan, taught crafts at the Henry Street Settlement House and the City and Country School in Manhattan. In her own work, she specialized in ceramic pots, vases, bowls and plates in an Art Deco style.
        She was married for 32 years to Francis Scott Bradford, a noted painter, until his death in 1961. In 1964 she married Mr. Ingersoll, an author and the former managing editor of The New Yorker and publisher of Time and a founder of Fortune and Life magazines, the newspaper PM and the Ingersoll newspaper chain. He died in 1985.
        She is survived by a sister, Ethel Montague of Mill Valley, Calif.
