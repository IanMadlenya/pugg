        Helen Del Monte, the fiction editor of McCall's magazine from 1969 to 1990, died Aug. 21 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 62 and lived in Manhattan.
        Mrs. Del Monte died of cancer, said her husband, Roy.
        A native of Los Angeles, Calif., Mrs. Del Monte graduated from Reed College in Portland, Ore., in 1952 and moved to New York City, where she soon took a job as a secretary at McCall's. She worked there until her retirement in 1990, advancing from secretary to editorial assistant to editor to fiction editor.
        During her early career, Mrs. Del Monte worked with such writers as Ben Hecht, John Steinbeck, William Saroyan and Irwin Shaw. She also edited the fiction of newer writers like Alice Adams, Margery Finn Brown, Ron Carlson and Nora Johnson. She was widely considered an editor of great sensitivity and insight, said Roberta Silman, one of the many writers whose work appeared in McCall's during Mrs. Del Monte's tenure.
        Mrs. Del Monte is survived by her husband.
