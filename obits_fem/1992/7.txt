        Catherine Viviano, an art dealer and consultant in Manhattan for many years, died on Tuesday at Hunterdon Medical Center in Flemington, N.J. She was 92 years old and had homes in Manhattan and Little York, N.J.
        She died of a stroke, said her sister Margaret, of Manhattan.
        From 1950 to 1970, the Catherine Viviano Gallery at 42 East 57th Street was the dealer for the Italian artists Afro, Mirko, Leonardo Cremonini and Renato Guttuso; the English artist Peter Lanyon, and the Americans Kay Sage, Carlyle Brown, Tony Rosenthal, Bernard Perlin and Joseph Glasco. The gallery also handled the estate of the German artist Max Beckmann.
        Born in Italy in 1899, Ms. Viviano came to the United States with her parents when she was 2 years old. She grew up in Chicago, where she studied at the Art Institute's school. Arriving in New York City in the early 1930's, she went to work for the Pierre Matisse Gallery, where she stayed for 16 years before leaving to open her own gallery. After closing it in 1970, she continued working as a private art consultant and dealer.
        In addition to her sister Margaret, she is survived by another sister, Virginia, of Manhattan, and a brother, Joseph, of Baltimore.
