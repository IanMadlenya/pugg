        Judith Brown, a sculptor of figurative works in steel, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 60 years old.
        She died of pancreatic cancer, said her daughter, Leslie.
        Using scrap and shaped steel and junkyard objects, Ms. Brown produced works that ranged from totemic Egyptian figures to prancing horses to liturgical objects for churches and synagogues. She made "Caryatids," a monumental sculpture of scrap steel, for the Donald M. Kendall Sculpture Gardens at Pepsico in Purchase, N.Y. Among other institutions that own her work are the Brooklyn Museum and the Museum of Modern Art. She also made jewelry from unconventional materials like artichoke leaves and palm bark as well as gold, silver and brass.
        Ms. Brown was born in New York City. She majored in art at Sarah Lawrence College, studying sculpture with Theodore Roszak, an early exponent of direct metal welding. Under his tutelage, she opened her own studio in New York after graduation, and later she set up a studio in Reading, Vt., where she worked in the summers. Her sculpture was influenced by the classical, Renaissance and Baroque works she sketched on trips to Europe, but it was also inspired by her love of dance, particularly the techniques and choreography of Martha Graham.
        A large wall sculpture by Ms. Brown, commissioned by the Federal Government's General Services Administration, is to be installed this summer at the Federal Courthouse in Trenton, N.J. A show of her recent, smaller works will open May 21 at Meisner SoHo, a gallery in Manhattan.
        Besides her daughter, who lives on Staten Island, Ms. Brown is survived by a son, Christopher, of Portland, Me., and a brother, Peter Stettenheim, of East Plainfield, Vt.
