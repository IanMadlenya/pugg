        Desanka Mohorovicic, who made front-page news in 1942 by giving birth in a crowded lifeboat off North Carolina after the American ship she was traveling on was sunk by a submarine, died last Thursday at Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, N.J. She was 78 years old and lived in River Edge, N.J.
        She died after a long illness, the Beaugard Funeral Home in River Edge said.
        Mrs. Mohorovicic, the wife of a Yugoslav consular official, was en route to New York from South Africa in March 1942 when a German U-boat torpedoed her ship. A Brooklyn physician, Dr. Leonard H. Conly, delivered the baby without anesthesia in a lifeboat tossed about in 15-foot waves even though he himself had two broken ribs.
        Mrs. Mohorovicic is survived by her son, Jesse Roper Mohorovic of Scituate, Mass., who was baptized at St. Patrick's Cathedral after being rescued by the destroyer Jesse Roper; two daughters, Vesna Jurick of River Edge and Grace Murray of New York City, and four grandchildren.
