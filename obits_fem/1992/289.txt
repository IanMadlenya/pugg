        Ruth Marguerite Vande Kieft, a professor emeritus of English at Queens College and an expert on Southern literature, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 67 years old.
        She died of cancer, a spokesman for the college said.
        Professor Vande Kieft retired last year, ending a 30-year career at the college. She had lectured on African-American literature and the work of novelists like Flannery O'Connor, William Faulkner and Eudora Welty. Her book "Eudora Welty," published in 1962 by Twayne Publishers, was the first full-length study of that writer. A review in The New York Times called it thorough and discriminating.
        Surviving is a sister, Clarice Ribbens of Front Royal, Va.
