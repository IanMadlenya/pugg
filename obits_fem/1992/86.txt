        M. Jean Herman, a brownstone holdout around whom a 31-story office tower was built opposite Bloomingdale's, died on Tuesday at Mount Sinai Hospital. She was 69 years old.
        She died of cancer, her family said.
        A graduate of Barnard College, Miss Herman worked as a market researcher and later became a freelance public relations specialist.
        She was a fourth-floor tenant of 134 East 60th Street when a developer assembled a blocklong site on Lexington Avenue. Other residents of her building and neighboring buildings relocated but she refused to move.
        Her apartment was rent-stabilized and she lived in it for more than 30 years, in the middle of Manhattan's choice shopping district. By 1986, she was the sole occupant of 134, sharing the address solely with the builder.  Miss Herman is survived by a brother, Harold Herman of Brooklyn.
