        Lucile Powell Singleton, one of the first female executives at CBS Radio, died last Wednesday at the South Roanoke Nursing Home in Virginia. She was 98 years old.
        She died of influenza, said her nephew, George Lightfoot Singleton of Birmingham, Ala.
        Miss Singleton joined CBS Radio, then in its infancy, in 1929, after working for the Federal Railroad Administration during World War I. At CBS, she was in charge of auditioning vocalists and supervising staff singers.  Among the performers Miss Singleton, herself an opera singer, introduced to the network were Eileen Farrell, the soprano, and Perry Como. From 1946 until her retirement in 1961, she was the manager of the CBS Radio Record Library and wrote and managed contracts for the network's performing artists.
        In addition to Mr. Singleton, she is also survived by another nephew, Alexander Edward Singleton 4th of McLean, Va., and a niece, Melinda Singleton Robinson of England.
