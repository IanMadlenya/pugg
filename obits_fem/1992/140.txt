        Jean Tilford Palmer, a former director of the Navy Waves and longtime administrator at Barnard College, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 88 years old.
        During World War II, Miss Palmer was a Wave captain, serving as women's reserve assistant to the Navy's director of enlisted personnel. She rose to the position of director of the Waves in 1945.
        Upon leaving the Navy, Miss Palmer joined the staff of Barnard as director of admissions in 1946. Three years later, she was appointed general secretary, in charge of the college's development plan.
        Remaining in this position for 23 years, Miss Palmer supervised all of the college's non-academic operations from admissions to fund-raising to the design of student dormitories.
        Born in Omaha, Miss Palmer was a graduate of Bryn Mawr College. Before enlisting in the Naval Reserve in 1942, she served as business manager of the Association of the Junior Leagues of America for 14 years.
        For her wartime service, she was awarded a Commendation from the Secretary of the Navy in 1944 and the Legion of Merit in 1946.
        She is survived by a brother, Morse Palmer of Delray Beach, Fla.
