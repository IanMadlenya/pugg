        Joan Hickcox Garrett-Goodyear, an associate professor of English at Smith College, died last Thursday at her home in South Hadley, Mass. She was 50 years old.
        She committed suicide by asphyxiation, said her husband, Harold Garrett-Goodyear, a history professor at Mount Holyoke College.
        During a 19-year teaching career at Smith, Dr. Garrett-Goodyear's research focused on 19th- and 20th-century fiction, particularly the works of Thackeray, Lawrence, and Nabokov.
        A native of Washington, she earned a bachelor's degree from Swarthmore College in 1963 and master's and doctoral degrees in English from Harvard University in 1965 and 1975.
        Besides her husband, she leaves a daughter, Cordelia, of South Hadley; her parents, Sylvester Garrett and Molly Yard, former president of the National Organization for Women, of Washington, and two brothers, James Garrett of Pittsburgh, and John Garrett of Rochester.
