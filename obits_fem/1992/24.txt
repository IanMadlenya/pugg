        Sally Mugabe, an anti-colonialist and the wife of President Robert Mugabe, died Monday. She was 60 years old and had suffered from a kidney disease, the Government announced.
        Mrs. Mugabe, who was born in Ghana, met Mr. Mugabe when he was teaching there in the 1950's. They married in 1961.
        She was often arrested by colonial police in what was previously called Southern Rhodesia for campaigning with her husband against white rule and spent six weeks in prison in 1961.
        President Mugabe is expected to cancel scheduled visits to a United Nations Security Council meeting in New York and talks in London with British Prime Minister John Major.
        The Mugabes' only child, a boy named Nhanodzenyika, which means "our country has problems" in the their tribal Shona language, died of cerebral malaria at the age of 3.
