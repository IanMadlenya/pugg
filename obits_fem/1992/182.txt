        Helen Olheim, a mezzo-soprano who sang with the Metropolitan Opera, died on Friday at the Beneva Nursing Pavilion in Sarasota, Fla. She was 87 years old.
        She died of natural causes, said her sister, Dorothy Dry of Berwick, Pa.
        Miss Olheim, whose name was Oelheim off the stage, was a member of the Metropolitan Opera from 1935 to 1944. Among her roles were Mercedes in "Carmen" and Siebel in "Faust."
        Miss Olheim was born in Buffalo and studied at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester. She sang with the American Opera Company and was a member of the Community Concert Series, which presented concerts around New York City. She also appeared in recital around the United States and in Europe, and was a guest on many radio programs.
        After retiring from the Met, she taught for 10 years at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts before moving to Sarasota.
        In addition to her sister, she is survived by a brother, Bennett C. Oelheim of Pacific Grove, Calif.
