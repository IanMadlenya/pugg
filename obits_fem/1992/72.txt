        Heidi Draper, who as Heidi Vosseler was a member of George Balanchine's first American ballet company, died on Monday at her home in Woodstock, N.Y. She was 74 years old.
        She died of lung cancer, said her daughter, Pamela.
        Miss Vosseler danced from 1935 to 1938 with the American Ballet, which was founded by Balanchine, Lincoln Kirstein and Edward M. M. Warburg in 1934, a year after Balanchine arrived in the United States from Europe. Miss Vosseler performed in Balanchine's first American ballet, "Serenade," in his "Alma Mater," and in dances he created for two opera productions at the Metropolitan. She was featured in two Broadway musicals, "The Boys from Syracuse," choreographed by Balanchine, and "Louisiana Purchase."
        Miss Vosseler married the tap dancer Paul Draper in 1941 and lived with him in Europe until returning to the United States in 1954.
        In addition to her daughter, who lives in Manhattan, she is survived by her husband, two other daughters, Susan Kosowski of Fishkill, N.Y., and Kate Draper of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
