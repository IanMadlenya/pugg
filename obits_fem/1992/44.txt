        Margaret Berol Craig, a champion shower of horses and trainer of dogs, died Monday at her home in Danbury, Conn. She was 78 years old.
        Mrs. Craig had been a part owner of her family's company, the Berol Corporation, the manufacturers of Eagle pencils. It was founded in Germany in the early 1800's, moved to New York City in 1856 and later to Danbury, and was sold in 1987.
        She was born in Elberon, N.J. She graduated from Bryn Mawr College in 1935 and the Columbia School of Journalism in 1940 and also attended the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons for two years.
        For about 25 years she raised, trained and rode horses for show and jumping, until a back ailment forced her to quit. She then took up the training of Shetland sheepdogs for another 25 years and was the oldest trainer competing in this year's National Obedience Championship, the Gaines Classic.
        She is survived by three sons, Geoffrey of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., Gregory of Newington, Conn., and Gordon of Sandy, Utah; four grandchildren and a brother, E. Albert Berol of Bedford Hills, N.Y.
