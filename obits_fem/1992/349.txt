        Maria Teresa Herrera-Uslar, the Dowager Marquesa de Torre Casa, who was a society figure, philanthropist and author, died on Saturday at the Caracas Medical Center in Venezuela. She was 78 and lived in Caracas.
        The Marquesa, who was widely known as Mimi Herrera, died of heart failure due to complications from cancer, said her son, Reinaldo Herrera, whose wife is the fashion designer Caroline Herrera.
        The objects of the Marquesa's philanthropy included the Venezuelan Red Cross, of which she was chairman for many years, and the National Gallery in Caracas. She was also active in the affairs of the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan. For more than 40 years, she maintained an apartment in Manhattan.
        She was born Maria Teresa Ladron de Guevara in Ciudad Bolivar, Venezuela, and was educated by tutors. Her writings include a book-length collection of her short stories in Spanish, titled "Sad Tales," which was published in Venezuela and Spain, and a Spanish translation of "The Rubaiyat" of Omar Khayyam that came out in Venezuela and is to have a new edition there next year.
        Her husband of 30 years, Reinaldo Herrera-Uslar, the Marques de Torre Casa, who owned sugar cane plantations, died in 1962. She is survived by two sons, Reinaldo Herrera of Manhattan and Caracas, who is an editor of Vanity Fair magazine, and Luis Felipe Herrera-Guevara of Caracas, and nine grandchildren.
