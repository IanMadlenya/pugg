        Phyllis Q. Blundell, a British sculptor and ceramist, died on March 24 at the A. O. Fox Hospital Nursing Home in Oneonta, N.Y. She was 102 years old and had lived at the nursing home for six years.
        She died of congestive heart failure, said Jeanine Peterson, a friend.
        Miss Blundell came to the United States in 1928 and worked in New York City until 1970. In the 1930's she was commissioned to do busts of Anna Roosevelt, the daughter of Eleanor and Franklin D. Roosevelt; Lily Pons, the opera singer, and Rubin Goldmark, a composer who taught in the 1930's at the Juilliard School. In the 1950's she was president of the New York Society of Ceramic Arts and her work was exhibited widely in New York galleries and at the Cooper Union Museum.
        There are no immediate survivors.
