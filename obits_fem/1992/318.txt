        Paula Antoinette Neill, owner of And Why Not?, a clothing boutique in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, died on Friday after she was struck by a commuter train at the Baldwin Station of the Long Island Rail Road. She was 37 years old and lived in Baldwin, L.I.
        Ms. Neill, a former dietitian, founded the boutique four years ago to showcase fashion and art by young black men and women. She was born in Jamaica and came to the United States in 1970.
        Susan McGowan, a spokeswoman for the L.I.R.R., said Ms. Neill's death was under investigation.
        She is survived by her husband, Aubey Neill, of Baldwin; a sister, Myrna Shrouder; a brother, Ken Chong, and her parents, Zena and Linton Shrouder, all of the Bronx.
