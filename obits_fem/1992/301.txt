        Jane Wasey, a sculptor known for her carvings of animals, died on Thursday at Penobscot Bay Medical Center in Glen Cove, Me. She was 80 years old and lived in Lincolnville, Me.
        Ms. Wasey died of cancer, said Priscilla Pattison, an artist and longtime friend.
        Ms. Wasey's work in stone, wood and bronze has been exhibited in New York at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum and the American Museum of Natural History, and at other museums in Maine and around the nation. Her work is in the permanent collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art and of the William A. Farnsworth Art Museum in Rockland, Me.
        Ms. Wasey was born in Chicago and began her career at the age of 17 in Paris as the only female assistant to the sculptor Paul Landowski. She worked with him on "Christ the Redeemer," the 98-foot statue on Corcovado Mountain in Rio de Janeiro.
        Working in Manhattan most of her life, Ms. Wasey focused on animal sculptures, both formally figurative and abstract, carved mostly in stone and wood. In 1978, she completed an outdoor statue of a harbor seal that overlooks the harbor in Marine Park in Rockport, Me.
        She was a founding member of the Sculptors Guild in New York City and a member of New England Sculptors Association and Audubon Artists.
        Ms. Wasey is survived by two daughters, Nina Mortellito of Manhattan and Jebba Handley of Chatham, Mass., and three grandchildren.
