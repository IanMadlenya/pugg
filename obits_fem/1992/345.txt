        Mary Green, a dancer, an actress, a writer and a longtime assistant to Agnes de Mille, died on Dec. 16 at St. Luke's Hospital in New York City. She was 82 years old.
        She died of pancreatic cancer, said Miss de Mille, who announced the death yesterday.
        Mrs. Green was trained at the Lester Horton school in Los Angeles and performed with the Lester Horton Dance Theater. Her film and theater roles included the player queen in the stage production of "Hamlet" starring Leslie Howard, and she played the dancer in a film version of "Romeo and Juliet" that starred Norma Shearer. With her husband, the late Dennis Green, she served as scriptwriter for "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes," starring Basil Rathbone.
        Mrs. Green was managing director of the Agnes de Mille Dance Theater from the 1960's through the early 70's, and she assisted Miss de Mille in her lecture appearances.
        There are no immediate survivors.
