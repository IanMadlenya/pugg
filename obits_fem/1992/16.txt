        Elsie May Gross Herzog, an interior designer for more than 50 years, died yesterday at her home in Larchmont, N.Y.
        She died of cancer, her family said. Her age was not given.
        Working under the business name of Elsie May Gross Interiors, she specialized in designing for residences throughout the New York metropolitan region. She also worked on civic buildings in New Rochelle, including two schools and City Hall. For three years in the 1960's, she was the host of "Ask Elsie," a call-in radio show on design that was broadcast in Westerly, R.I.
        She was a graduate of the Parsons School of Design and an officer and member of the American Society of Interior Designers, which cited the quality of her work in awards. She was also a member of the Decorators Club and served on the board of the Thomas Paine Historical Association.
        Born in Cincinnati, she grew up there and in Flushing, Queens. Mrs. Herzog was a granddaughter of Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise, the founder of Reform Judaism in America and of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in Cincinnati.
        She was divorced from Albert P. Gross of Manhattan. Her second husband, Robert S. Herzog, died last year.
        She is survived by two daughters, Nancy Gross Blase of Seattle, and Elizabeth Gross Holland of Downers Grove, Ill.; a son, Edward A. Gross of Salem, Ore., and three grandchildren.
