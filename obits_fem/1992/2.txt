        Cecile L. Naumburg, a philanthropist and former board member of Carnegie Hall and other cultural organizations, died on Friday at Lenox Hill Hospital.  Mrs. Naumburg was 94 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Her death was caused by respiratory failure, her family said.
        She was born in Philadelphia and went to the Friends Select School there. Her first husband, W. Maurice Steppacher, who was vice president and treasurer of the WDAS radio station in Philadelphia, died in 1936.
        In 1937 she moved to New York City and married George W. Naumburg, an investment banker. They also had a second home in New City, N.Y.
        Sharing her husband's love of music, Mrs. Naumburg served as a director on the boards at the Greenwich School of Music, the Friends of French Opera and the Naumburg Park Concerts. Family contributions helped build the Naumburg bandshell in Central Park. She was also a longtime board member of the Day Schools Association.
        She is survived by two sons, Walter Steppaccher of Sarasota, Fla., and John Steppacher of Waccabuc, N.Y.; a daughter, Doris Judell of White Plains; two stepsons, George Naumburg of North Salem, N.Y., and Philip Naumburg of Sante Fe, N.M.; a stepdaughter, Ellen London of Pound Ridge, N.Y.; eight grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
