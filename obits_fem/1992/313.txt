        Jacqueline K. Eubanks, a college librarian, an editor and a proponent of multicultural education, died on Thursday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 54 years old and lived in Brooklyn.
        She died of complications from AIDS, said friends and colleagues at the library at Brooklyn College, where she was on the faculty since 1966.
        Ms. Eubanks significantly expanded the college library's African and Caribbean collection and was a founding member of the Social Responsibilities Roundtable of the American Library Association.
        She was the originator and senior editor of "Alternatives in Print," an international catalog of books, pamphlets, periodicals and audio-visual material not easily found in mainstream references works. She also helped organize book fairs in the city.
        Ms. Eubanks grew up in Chicago. She earned her bachelor's degree and master's degree in library science at the University of Chicago and a master's degree at Columbia University Teachers College.
        Before joining Brooklyn College, she worked as a librarian for the United States Army Special Services in Germany and for the American Association of Advertising Agencies in Manhattan.
        Her marriage to Lloyd W. Eubanks ended in divorce.
        She is survived by a brother, Alan Peldzus of Chicago.
