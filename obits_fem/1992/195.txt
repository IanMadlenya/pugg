        Caroline Miller Ray, whose first novel won the 1934 Pulitzer Prize for literature, died on Sunday at her home in Waynesville, N.C. She was 88 years old.
        A son, George A. Miller, said the exact cause of death was not known.
        Under the name Caroline Miller, Mrs. Ray burst upon the national scene with the publication of the prize-winning book "Lamb in His Bosom," a tale, derived from the history of her extended family, about a backwoods community in pre-Civil War Georgia.  Reviewing it for The New York Times Book Review, Louis Kronenberger wrote that it had "a wonderful freshness about it; not simply the freshness of a new writer, but the freshness of a new world," and that Mrs. Ray's strength was her ability to use words to paint "a wonderful large and vital picture."
        At the time, she lived in Baxley, Ga., and was married to her first husband, William D. Miller. The Millers were divorced in 1936. In 1937, she married Clyde H. Ray Jr., a businessman in Waynesville. Mr. Ray died in 1976.
        She published her second and final work in 1944, a novel called "Lebanon," which described the beauty of nature and the rhythm of rural life.
        In addition to her son George, of Mountain Home, N.C., she is survived by two other sons, William D. Miller Jr. of Bethesda, Md., and Clyde H. Ray 3d of Cullowhee, N.C.; a daughter, Caroline Ray Morgan of Annapolis, Md.; 17 grandchildren, and 13 great-grandchildren.
