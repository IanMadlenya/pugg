        Hope Yandell Hanes, who bred and raced champion horses, died yesterday at her home in Millbrook, N.Y. She was 86 years old.
        She died of multiple ailments, her family said.
        Mrs. Hanes started racing horses in the 1930's. Her husband, John Wesley Hanes Sr., joined in the venture, and they owned many stakes winners in England, Ireland and the United States. They were involved in the syndication of Nashua, Royal Charger and My Babu.
        She was also a patron of the Metropolitan Opera and was an amateur painter, sculptor and writer.
        Born in Danville, Ky., Mrs. Hanes grew up there and in Greenwich, Conn. She was educated at Bryn Mawr College, where she formed a lifelong friendship with her roommate, Katharine Hepburn.
        She was married for 55 years to Mr. Hanes, who died in 1987. He was an Under Secretary of the Treasury in the Roosevelt Administration, the head of the New York Racing Association and a part owner in the company that made Hanes hosiery and underwear.
        Mrs. Hanes is survived by their daughter, Susan H. Caldwell of Manhattan; two stepdaughters, June H. McKnight of Norwich, Vt., and Ormsby H. Matthiessen of Old Lyme, Conn.; a stepson, John W. Hanes Jr. of Alexandria, Va.; a brother, Lunsford P. Yandell of Scottsdale, Ariz.; 16 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.
