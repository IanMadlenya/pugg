        Mabel Randall Thomas, who led the Big Sisters of New York in the creation of its programs to help troubled children, died on Tuesday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 75 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She died of a heart attack after a long illness, her family said.
        Miss Thomas served as the first full-time executive director of the organization, from 1952 until her retirement about 25 years later. Big Sisters eventually merged with the Big Brothers organization.
        During her tenure, Big Sisters built a staff of social workers, psychologists and other professionals and opened offices in courts across the city to help neglected, delinquent or otherwise troubled youngsters. The annual caseload jumped from a relative handful to thousands. Her efforts won awards from the City Bar Association in New York and Community Trust.
        Miss Thomas was born in Montgomery, Ala. She graduated from the University of Alabama in 1939. During World War II she worked on the staff of the U.S.O. at Fort McClellan, Ala., and later for the Red Cross. She resumed her studies at Columbia University, where she earned a master's degree in social work in 1952.
        She is survived by two brothers, William of Montgomery and Walton of Milwaukee, and three sisters, Jean Walker of Tuscaloosa, Ala., and Anna Atherton and Ethel Golson, both of Montgomery.
        Correction:  July 21, 1992, Tuesday
        An obituary yesterday about Mabel R. Thomas, who led the Big Sisters of New York in helping troubled children, referred incorrectly to the status of the organization. It is independent, and separate from Big Brothers.
