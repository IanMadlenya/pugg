        Gretchen Householder Poston, the White House social secretary in the Carter Administration, died Monday at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. She was 59 years old and lived in Washington.
        She died of breast cancer, her family said.
        Mrs. Poston, who was born in Minneapolis, graduated from St. Mary's College in Leavenworth, Kan., and taught school for six years before moving to Washington, where she became involved in charitable fund raising and Democratic Party activities. She worked for the campaign of every Democratic Presidential nominee from 1964 on.
        Mrs. Poston was a founder and co-owner of WashingtonInc., an events-planning company begun in 1967.
        In January 1977, she was appointed the White House social secretary, a post in which she organized the visit of Pope John Paul II to the White House and state dinners celebrating the Panama Canal treaty, the Camp David accords and normalized relations with China.
        Leaving the White House at the end of the Carter Administration, she returned to WashingtonInc. Among the events she organized there were a dinner for recipients of the Medal of Honor; a tribute to Adm. Hyman Rickover; celebrations marking the 25th anniversary of the National Endowment for the Humanities, the 75th anniversary of the Brookings Institution and the 20th anniversary of National Public Radio, and a dinner honoring the Polish leader Lech Walesa during his 1989 visit to the United States.
        In 1990, Mrs. Poston helped establish the Washington Race for the Cure, a five-kilometer run that had been held annually in other cities to raise awareness about breast cancer prevention and to promote support for research to find a cure.
        Surviving are her husband, Raymond L. Poston of Washington; four children, Jeffrey L., Carol D., Ramsey R. and Katharene J., all of Washington, and a sister, Diane J. Welch of Kansas City, Mo.
