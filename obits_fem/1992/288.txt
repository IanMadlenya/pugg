        Patricia B. Ewell, who acted in Broadway plays in the 1920's, 30's and 40's, died on Sunday at her home in Dennis, Mass. She was 93 years old.
        She died after a brief illness, her family said.
        Performing under her stage name, Patricia Barclay, Mrs. Ewell started her career with the Theater Guild. She appeared in plays with Claude Rains and Spencer Tracy, among others, and she also worked in regional theaters across the country.
        The New York Sun praised "her simplicity, her natural beauty and her extraordinary talent." In The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson described her acting as "delightful."
        Mrs. Ewell, whose maiden name was Riordan, was born in Manhattan.
        Her marriage to Hardwick Nevin, a playwright, ended in divorce.
        She is survived by her husband of 56 years, Richard Ewell, a retired actor.
