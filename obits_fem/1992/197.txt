        Elsie Driggs, an early practitioner of Precisionist painting, died on Sunday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 93 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Miss Driggs, who had been hospitalized for a fractured pelvis, died in her sleep, said her daughter, Merriman Gatch of Manhattan.
        In the 1920's, when the American art scene was still forming, Miss Driggs was one of several artists whose images of American cities and factories, painted with a hard-edged but somewhat abstract exactness, earned the name Precisionism. She exhibited at the Daniel Gallery in Manhattan, and in the early 1930's was the first artist invited to join the Public Works of Art Project, the predecessor of the Works Progress Administration, which gave artists work during the Depression.
        Miss Driggs was born in Hartford in 1895. She attended the Art Students League in Manhattan between 1918 and 1921, studying with John Sloan and George Luks. A trip to Italy in 1922 exposed her to the work of the Renaissance painter Piero della Francesca, whose classical sense of form influenced her images of machine-age America.
        Miss Driggs married the painter Lee Gatch in 1935 and lived with him in New Jersey until his death in 1968, when she moved back to Manhattan. In 1980 she had an exhibition at Martin Diamond Fine Arts. In 1991 the New Jersey State Museum in Trenton organized a retrospective show that also traveled to the Phillips Collection in Washington.
        She is survived by her daughter.
