        Abigail Adams Eliot, a social worker who became a nationally known authority on early childhood education, died Thursday at the New England Deaconess Home, a nursing home in Concord, Mass. She had celebrated her 100th birthday on Oct. 9.
        She died of a heart attack, said Jay Chrepta, a spokesman for Tufts University.
        Dr. Eliot became active in the field after World War I, when the first few nursery schools with child study centers were set up in the United States.
        After enrolling in the early 1920's at the Rachel MacMillan School and Training Center in London, one of the few schools that then trained nursery school teachers, Dr. Eliot returned to the United States, and she and Elizabeth W. Pearson, a Boston philanthropist, founded the Ruggles Street Nursery School in the Roxbury section of Boston. It taught children and also provided teacher-training in early childhood education.
        In later years Dr. Eliot's institution evolved, becoming successively the Ruggles Street Nursery School and Training Center and the Nursery Training School of Boston. She was its director from 1922 until she retired in 1952.
        That year, the institution was incorporated into Tufts, was moved to Medford, Mass., and was renamed the Eliot-Pearson Department of Child Study at Tufts University.
        During the Depression, the Roosevelt Administration's Federal Emergency Relief Administration, with the cooperation of the United States Office of Education, organized what it called emergency nursery schools for needy children. Dr. Eliot, who was then secretary-treasurer of the National Association for Nursery Education, became a member of the National Advisory Committee for the program.
        She was born in Boston, graduated from Radcliffe College in 1914 and was a social worker for several years. She received her doctorate in education from Harvard University in 1930.
        There are no immediate survivors.
