        Emily Sears Lodge Clark, the widow of Henry Cabot Lodge, the Senator and Republican Vice-Presidential nominee in 1960, died Saturday in her house in Beverly, Mass. She was 86 years old.
        She died of lung cancer, said her son Henry Sears Lodge.
        Mrs. Clark was married to Forrester A. Clark, a retired investment banker, in 1987, two years after Mr. Lodge died.
        She was born in Beverly, the daughter of Henry F. Sears, a doctor, and grew up partly in France. Her schooling as a child came largely from tutors.
        She met Mr. Lodge at a debutante party in Boston, and they were married in 1926. She was at his side while Mr. Lodge was a Senator from Massachusetts, United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Ambassador to South Vietnam and Ambassador to West Germany.
        In addition to her husband, Mr. Clark, she is survived by two sons, George Cabot Lodge and Henry Sears Lodge, both of Beverly; 10 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.
