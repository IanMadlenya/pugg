        Dr. June Louin-Tapp, a professor at the University of Minnesota's Institute of Child Development, died last Thursday in Osnabruck, Germany, while there for a two-month stay as a visiting professor at the University of Osnabruck. Dr. Louin-Tapp, a resident of Minneapolis, was 62 years old.
        She died suddenly after a brief illness, said Richard Weinberg, director of the institute.
        She taught and did research at the University of Chicago from 1964 to 1972, when she joined the Minnesota faculty. Her principal work concerned children's and adults' understanding of rules and laws.
        She is survived by two daughters, Mara Tapp of Chicago and Kami Olsson-Tapp of San Diego, and four grandchildren.
