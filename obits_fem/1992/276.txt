        Maud Sargent, a retired landscape architect and planner in New York City and Philadelphia, died on Wednesday at her home in Chester, Conn. She was 93 years old.
        She died of complications of bone cancer, a spokeswoman for her estate said.
        While working for the Manhattan Department of Borough Works, Miss Sargent was responsibility for designing Carl Schurz Park along the East River. The park surrounds Gracie Mansion, the Mayor's official residence. In 1937 she represented the United States at an international meeting of architects, landscape architects and city planners in Switzerland.
        There are no immediate survivors.
