        Dorothy Rodgers, a writer, interior decorator and inventor and the widow of the composer Richard Rodgers, died at her home in Manhattan yesterday. She was 83 years old.
        She died of emphysema, said her daughters, Mary Rodgers Guettel of Manhattan and Linda Rodgers Emory of Katonah, N.Y.
        Mrs. Rodgers, whose maiden name was Feiner, was born in New York City. She attended the Horace Mann School and studied art and interior design at Wellesley College from 1926 to 1928. In 1930 she married Mr. Rodgers, who collaborated with the lyricist Oscar Hammerstein 2d on musicals including "Oklahoma!," "South Pacific," "The King and I" and "The Sound of Music." Mr. Rodgers died in 1979.
        Mrs. Rodgers founded Repairs Inc., an agency that hired craftsmen to repair broken objects, in 1935 and was its head until 1941. In 1945 she patented the Jonny Mop, which was sold by Johnson & Johnson. It was one of several inventions. In 1958 she created the Basically Yours dress pattern for McCall's, and in 1972 she patented the Turn and Learn storybooks, sold by the Ideal Toy Company. Books for Home and Family
        Mrs. Rodgers wrote several books on home design and entertaining, including "My Favorite Things" (1964) and "The House in My Head" (1967). With her daughter Mary, she wrote "A Word to the Wives" (1970), which offered advice on mother-daughter relations. The book led to a nationally syndicated radio program in 1971 and 1972 and a monthly column for McCall's magazine called "Of Two Minds," which ran from 1971 to 1979.
        Mrs. Rodgers was an officer of many charitable and arts organizations, including the Authors League of America, the American Institute of Interior Designers, the Public Education Association, the Museum of Modern Art, the American Red Cross, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the New York State Council on the Arts, the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies and the Jewish Museum.
        In addition to her daughters, she is survived by six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
