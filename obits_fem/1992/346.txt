        Sybil Andrews, a printmaker, died on Monday in a nursing home in Victoria, British Columbia. She was 94 years old and had lived in Campbell River, British Columbia, since immigrating to Canada from England in 1947.
        She died of heart failure, said Laurence Hovde of the Mary Ryan Gallery, the artist's New York representative.
        Miss Andrews, who was born in Bury St. Edmunds, England, on April 19, 1898, specialized in linocuts, a printing method popularized between the wars in England by the artist Claude Flight, who was her teacher at the Grosvenor School.
        As a member of a group of artists known as the Grosvenor School, she used the technique to create boldly patterned images, usually of urban life, in a style influenced by Cubism, Futurism and Vorticism.
        There are no immediate survivors.
