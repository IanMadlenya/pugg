        Dr. Eleanor P. Spencer, a scholar of medieval art, died on Tuesday at Le Vieux Chateau, a retirement home near Paris. She was 97 years old.
        Dr. Spencer was the first woman to receive the Sachs Fellowship for Research in the Fine Arts from Harvard University, which enabled her to earn a doctorate at Radcliffe College. Earlier, she had received a bachelor's and a master's degree from Smith College and had studied at the Sorbonne in Paris.
        After nearly 10 years of teaching at Smith, at Mount Holyoke and at Wellesley, she became an associate professor of art at Goucher College in Baltimore and remained there until her retirement at age 67. While teaching at Goucher, she also served on the board of the Baltimore Museum of Art and other local art institutions, and was co-author with Richard H. Howland of "The Architecture of Baltimore: A Pictorial History."
        After retiring, Dr. Spencer received a Fulbright grant and returned to Paris, where she researched 15th-century French book illustration and wrote articles for scholarly journals. Most of her work was devoted to the Sobieski Hours, a manuscript in the Royal Library at Windsor Castle.
        There are no survivors.
