        Myra de Haven Woodruff, a specialist in child development who helped shape the modern nursery-school system during and after World War II, died on Friday at Medford Leas, a retirement community in Medford, N.J., where she had lived for the last 20 years. She was 95 years old.
        Miss Woodruff, a native of Ogden, Utah, graduated from Oberlin College and Teachers College at Columbia University. She worked as a psychologist and helped establish programs for nursery schools and parent education in North Carolina and Pennsylvania before going to work for the New York State Department of Education in 1941.
        Three years later, she joined the department's Bureau of Child Development and Parent Education. She was bureau chief from 1953 until her retirement in 1966. She was a past president of the Association for Childhood Education International and the author of many articles for professional publications.
        Miss Woodruff left no immediate survivors.
