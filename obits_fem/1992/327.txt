        Norma K. Regan, a high school teacher and sculptor, died on Tuesday in a convalescent home in West Hartford, Conn. She was 95 years old and had been a longtime resident of Hartford.
        She died of pneumonia, said a spokesman for the DellaVeccia Funeral Home in Southington, Conn.
        A member of the Hartford public school system for many years, Miss Regan taught English at Weaver and Bulkeley high schools. She also coached students for college entrance examinations.
        Inspired by Alexander Caldor, she studied sculpture while teaching. Her works were exhibited in group shows at the New Britain Museum of American Art, the New Haven Paint and Clay Club, the Yale Art Gallery, the Springfield Museum in Massachusetts and other galleries.
        Miss Regan graduated from Cornell University in 1919. She was a member of the Cornell Club of Greater Hartford from 1959 to 1979, actively involved in regional programming, student recruitment and fund raising. She also belonged to the Advisory Council in the College of Arts and Sciences at Cornell and the University Council. She was honored by the university in 1981 as a "foremost benefactor."
        Miss Regan sponsored a film, "Cornell Plantations" in 1974-75 and was special consultant for a film, "Mr. President," in 1977-78, on the university's president, Frank H. T. Rhodes.  Both films were shown on public television in Connecticut and elsewhere.
        She is survived by a cousin, Normadiene W. England of Southington.
