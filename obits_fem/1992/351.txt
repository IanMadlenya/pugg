        Judge Frances Williamson Lehrich, a lawyer and former New York City magistrate, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 92.
        She died of a heart attack, said her daughter, Jacqueline L. Becker of Boca Raton, Fla.
        Judge Lehrich, who was born in Brooklyn, forged a distinguished legal career at a time when such opportunities were all but closed to women.
        A graduate of Girls High School in Brooklyn and Barnard College, Judge Lehrich attended Yale Law School, where she was the first woman to become a member of the Yale Law Journal. She graduated from Yale in 1922 and joined the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell.
        In 1935, she was appointed an assistant corporation counsel of New York City during the term of Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia. In 1938 he appointed her secretary to the Board of Estimate and, in 1941, to a 10-year term as a City Magistrate. Judge Lehrich was the third woman in the city's history to be appointed to the bench.
        After leaving the bench in 1951, Judge Lehrich continued to practice law and to be active in civic affairs. During the 1960's and 1970's she was a member and chairman of the Arbitration Association of America.
        Judge Lehrich's husband, Henry, a lawyer, died in 1966.
        In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a grandson, a granddaughter, and two great-grandchildren.
