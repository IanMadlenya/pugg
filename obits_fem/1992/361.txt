        Rosalind A. Lorwin, a professor emeritus of social psychology at San Diego State University and a former mayor of Del Mar, Calif., died Thursday at her home in Del Mar. She was 66.
        She died of cancer, said her daughter, Susan Feierabend Peters, of San Francisco.
        Professor Lorwin specialized in the psychological analysis of political violence. She did much of her research on the topic with her former husband, Ivo K. Feierabend.
        Professor Lorwin was born in Manhattan, the daughter of Lewis Lorwin, an economist, and Rose Strunsky, a writer. She was raised and educated in Switzerland before attending Swarthmore College, from which she graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1946. She earned a master's degree in psychology from the University of California at Berkeley and a doctorate in the field from Yale University in 1955.
        She was a member of the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence in 1968.
        Professor Lorwin was a member of the Del Mar City Council from 1980 to 1984 and was Mayor from 1983 to 1984.
        A brother, Val R. Lorwin, died in 1982.
        In addition to her daughter, Professor Lorwin is survived by her husband of 18 years, Alain Virnot; two sons, Tom, of Paris, and Steve, of Plainsboro, N.J; a brother, Boris, of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
