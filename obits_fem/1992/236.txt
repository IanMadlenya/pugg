        Nguyen Thi Dinh, a leading figure in the Vietnamese Communist struggle against the French colonial Government and in the American war more than a decade later, died on Wednesday in Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon. She was 72 years old.
        Her death was reported from Hanoi yesterday by the Reuters news agency. The cause was not given.
        Vietnamese officials were quoted by Reuters as saying that Mrs. Dinh had been the outstanding woman in Vietnam's modern history.
        Mrs. Dinh was one of six vice presidents of Vietnam's Council of State, a sort of collective presidency, having been named to the post in 1987. She was a former member of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Communist Party. Ranking Woman in Vietcong
        In the 1960's, Mrs. Dinh emerged as the senior woman within the Vietcong insurgency against the American-allied South Vietnamese Government. She was a member of the Presidium of the National Liberation Front, the political form of the Vietcong.
        The Soviet and Chinese press identified her as deputy commander of the Vietcong guerrillas in 1965, at a time of large-scale American entry into the war.
        Simultaneously, she headed the Women's Liberation Association, an organization with village cells in areas controlled by the Vietcong.
        Mrs. Dinh was believed to be a widow; details of her family life were not known. She was born in 1920 in southern Vietnam, then part of French Indochina. In her childhood, nationalist and revolutionary groups had started operating against the French colonial administration. She joined one of them, the clandestine Vietnamese Communist Party, at the age of 18. The authorities sent her to prison for three years in 1940 because of her role.
        Mrs. Dinh's body will lie in state in Ho Chi Minh City. She will buried there tomorrow.
