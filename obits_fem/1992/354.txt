        Rebecca Ann Donovan, a sociologist and an associate professor at Hunter College, died on Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 46 and lived in Manhattan.
        She died of breast cancer, said Robert Bazell, a friend.
        Professor Donovan was the head of research at the Hunter College School of Social Work. She specialized in the study of the social consequences of economic change, such as the impact of job loss on individuals.
        She was born in Peoria, Ill., and earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Missouri in 1968 and a doctorate from the Columbia School of Social Work in 1983. Before joining the Hunter faculty, she taught at New York University and Columbia, where she was research director of the school's Industrial Social Welfare Center.
        She is survived by her companion, Susan Hajjar; her mother, Sarah Donovan of Winter Park, Fla., and a sister, Janette Harriott of Edmond, Okla.
