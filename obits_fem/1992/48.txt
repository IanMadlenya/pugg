        She died of cancer, her family said.
        Mrs. Arenth was the vice president of nursing and patient services at Hopkins. Earlier, she was the first director of nursing at the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, where she developed the system now used nationally to designate nursing services for different types of cancer patients. She was the first recipient of the national Oncology Nursing Society's award for excellence in the administration of cancer nursing.
        She was also on the boards of the Foundation for Nursing of Maryland and Health Care for the Homeless.
        Born in Orange, Calif., she grew up in nearby Bellflower. She graduated from Cottey College in Nevada, Mo., in 1952 and earned a nursing degree from the University of Southern California in 1955 and a master's degree from the University of Maryland in 1974. She was a doctoral candidate at Columbia University.
        She was divorced from Donald Arenth, a designer who died last year.
        She is survived by two sons, Craig of Albuquerque, N.M., and Sean of Frostburg, Md.; two sisters, Janet Morgan of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., and Maureen Morgan of Ossining, N.Y.; two brothers, Peter Magnusson of Spokane, Wash., and Dennis Magnusson of Boston, Mass.
