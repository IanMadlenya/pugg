        Constance M. Adamec, a vice president in Sotheby's finance department and a tenant advocate on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, died suddenly on Monday at her home. She was 52 years old.
        An announcement by Sotheby's said she died of an asthma attack.
        Ms. Adamec had a 33-year career at Sotheby's, having joined its predecessor in North America, Parke-Bernet Galleries, as a billing clerk in 1958. She was promoted to vice president in 1985.
        She joined the tenant cause in 1970 when she began a successful six-year fight against eviction from her home while raising three children by herself. She was active in the Lenox Hill Neighborhood Association for more than 30 years and helped form the East Side Tenants Union in the early 1970's. She served three consecutive terms as chairwoman of Community Planning Board No. 8, from 1985 to 1988.
        Ms. Adamec is survived by her daughter, Justene Adamec of Los Angeles; her sons, Edward and Paul, both of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
