She had also served as the Senate's vice chairwoman for four years and its Governance Committee chairwoman for two years.
        Dr. Wedeen graduated from Brooklyn College in 1946. At New York University she earned a master's degree in guidance counseling in 1947 and a doctorate in psychology in 1951.
