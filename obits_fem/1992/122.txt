        Florence Tenzer, a benefactor of educational institutions, died Wednesday at St. John's Episcopal Hospital in Far Rockaway, Queens. She was 86 years old and had lived in Lawrence, L.I., since 1947.
        The cause of death was cancer, according to a statement from Yeshiva University.
        Mrs. Tenzer was born Florence Navor in Philadelphia. She and her husband of 62 years, former United States Representative Herbert Tenzer, took leading roles at the university for many years. Their $1 million dollar gift in 1989 endowed a Herbert and Florence Tenzer University Fellows Program to benefit outstanding students at Yeshiva's graduate schools. She also was active in Jewish affairs.
        In addition to her husband, Mrs. Tenzer is survived by a son, Barry, of Manhattan and Quogue, L.I.; a daughter, Diane Schachter, of Hewlett Bay Park, L.I., and nine grandchildren.
