        Novetah Holmes Davenport, an early pilot who became an executive in the aircraft industry, died July 3 at a nursing home in Pompano Beach, Fla. She was 90 years old.
        Mrs. Davenport received her pilot's license in 1930, continued to fly for many years and, at the age of 60, earned a license for hot-air ballooning. She was a friend of Amelia Earhart and was active in International Women Pilots, which Miss Earhart founded.
        At various times in a long career, Mrs. Davenport worked for Sikorsky Aviation as its advertising and publicity manager, for Flying magazine as an associate editor and for Fairchild Aviation and the United Aircraft and Transport Corporation in administrative posts.
        Her pilot training helped her survive as a passenger aboard a Pan American World Airways plane that crashed and sank off San Juan, P.R., in 1952. She looked out a window and saw engine trouble, so she warned others on board to prepare for an emergency landing. She managed to escape and to rescue a child whose parents were among the 52 people killed. Only 17 people survived.
        Mrs. Davenport was born in Piermont, N.Y., and was educated in San Juan and New York City. She was active in the Girl Scouts of America and wrote two books on Scouting.
        She was married for more than 40 years to Guiles Deane Davenport, who is deceased. Her survivors include a sister, Margaret Holmes Scarborough of Norfolk, Va., and Manchester, N.H.
