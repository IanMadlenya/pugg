        Sara Chisholm Farrington, a writer and a pioneer in international big-game fishing, died Thursday at Southhampton Hospital on Long Island. She was 84 years old.
        She died of pneumonia after suffering a stroke, her family said.
        Brought up in Manhattan and Long Island, she went to the Spence and Farmington schools. In 1934, she married a noted outdoorsman and author, Selwyn Kip Farrington Jr.
        Mrs. Farrington, under the pen name of Chisie Farrington and as an internationally known angler with seven world records to her credit, wrote "Women Can Fish" in 1951. The book chronicled her experiences accompanying her husband on fishing trips around the world. "Women Can Fish," as well as the fishing articles she wrote in the 1930's and 40's for Harpers Bazaar, Vogue and Mademoiselle, helped to establish women as sporting participants in their own right.
        The Farringtons traveled in a circle of big-game adventurers who included Ernest Hemingway and Alfred Glassell. In their company, Sara Farrington was an angler among equals: The 674-pound tuna she caught off Watch Hill, R.I., in the mid-1950's was first tuna that had ever been caught in those fishing grounds by man or woman.
        She is survived by a grandniece, Patricia McCain, and a grandnephew, Charles Madeira.
