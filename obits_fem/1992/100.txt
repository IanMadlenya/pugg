        Inez Camprubi Mabon, a former publisher of the La Prensa Spanish-language newspaper in New York City, died on Friday at her home in Southbury, Conn. She was 80 years old and also lived in Greenwich, Conn.
        She died of cancer, a relative said.
        Mrs. Mabon ran La Prensa from 1950 to 1963, when it was sold and merged with El Diario. Her father, Jose Camprubi, founded the publication as a general interest daily paper in 1913, and she took over after he died. It circulated nationally and claimed to be the oldest Spanish-language newspaper in the continental United States.
        Mrs. Mabon was born in New York City. She studied at the Art Students League in Manhattan and continued portrait and landscape painting as a hobby the rest of her life.
        Her husband was John Scott Mabon, a publishing executive who was the acting director of University of Michigan Press. He is deceased.
        She is survived by a son, Ferdy C. of Greenwich, and a sister, Leontine Tintner of Vienna, Austria.
