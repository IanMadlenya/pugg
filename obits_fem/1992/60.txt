        Marion F. Schappel, a retired vice president at Citibank and one of the first women there to reach that rank, died on Wednesday at her home in Somers, N.Y. She was 67 years old.
        She died of complications of cancer, her family said.
        Miss Schappel was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Mahwah, N.J. She started at Citibank when she was 18, after graduation from high school. Her first job was as a page. She worked her way up to become secretary to a branch manager. After years of experience, she often found herself explaining procedures to younger male executive trainees.
        In 1961 she was promoted to assistant manager, only the third woman in the bank's 151-year history to hold such a post. By 1964 there were a dozen female assistant managers and she was chosen from them to study at the Stonier Graduate School of Banking at Rutgers University. She and 22 other students from other banks that year were the first women admitted at Stonier.
        In 1965 she was one of four women promoted to assistant vice president at Citibank and in 1972 became a vice president. Most of her work was in branch banking. She spent 22 years in the branch at the bank's headquarters at 399 Park Avenue in Manhattan and became its manager. She was also manager of the branch in the Pan Am Building. She retired from full-time work in 1987 but continued as a consultant to the bank for three years.
        Surviving are two brothers, Robert B. of Pasco, Wash., and Richard B. of Oak Ridge, Tenn.
