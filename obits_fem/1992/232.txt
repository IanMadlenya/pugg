        Virginia Sale, a character actress whose career in theater, film, radio and television spanned more than four decades, died on Sunday at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif., where she lived. She was 93 years old.
        She died of heart failure, her family said.
        Miss Sale was best known for her work in Hollywood, where by her count she played more than 300 supporting roles in films, beginning with silent comedies in 1927 and concluding with "Slither" in 1970.
        She also appeared for eight years in the radio serial "Those We Love," and she wrote and starred in "The Wrens' Nest," one of television's first family comedies, which was broadcast by ABC in 1949. She was frequently seen on the Garry Moore and Kate Smith shows and in other television comedies, including "Petticoat Junction" and "Green Acres."
        Miss Sale also won acclaim for her one-woman show, "Americana Sketches," in which she drew upon her upbringing in Urbana, Ill., to explore the foibles and humor of small town-America.
        Miss Sale attended the University of Illinois for two years and graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York. Her films included the 1930 "Moby Dick," with John Barrymore, and a string of Westerns, including "Badman's Territory" and "Trail Street," with Randolph Scott.
        Miss Sale's husband, Sam Wren, an actor and director, died in Hollywood in 1962.
        She is survived by a daughter, Virginia Wren Moore of Lake Forest, Ill., and a son, Christopher S. Wren of Manhattan, who is editor of new projects for The New York Times.
