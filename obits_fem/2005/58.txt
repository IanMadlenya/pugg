        Deena Burton, an expert on Indonesian dance, died April 3 at her mother's home in Queens. She was 56 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was lung cancer, said Helene Browning, a friend.
        Born in New York City, Ms. Burton began her studies of Asian theater at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. She studied Indonesian dance and music at the Center for World Music in Berkeley, Calif., and at the University of Hawaii, supporting herself by working as a nightclub dancer and in a cruise-ship act, the Real Sisters. She spent more than six years studying and researching dance and dance drama in Indonesia.
        Ms. Burton received a doctorate in performance studies from New York University in 2000. She organized film documentation of the seldom performed Cireonese wayang orang dance with masks in the Indonesian city of Cirebon. She edited a collection of early 20th-century films on traditional Indonesian culture at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center and received a Fulbright scholarship to show the films to scholars and artists in Indonesia.
        Ms. Burton performed with dance troupes in Java and founded the Bali-Java Dance Theater in New York City. She also choreographed and performed in Off Off Broadway theater productions and performed traditional Javanese dance and her own choreography at theaters and schools around the metropolitan area and on tour.
        In addition, she taught world dance in the theater program at the Eugene Lang College of the New School University and in the theater arts department at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.
        Ms. Burton is survived by her husband, Skip LaPlante; her son, Roan LaPlante; and her mother, Beatrice Soloway, all of New York City; and a half-brother, Richard Burton, of California.
