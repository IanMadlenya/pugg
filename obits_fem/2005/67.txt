        Kay Gardella, a television critic and columnist for The Daily News who worked at that paper for nearly 60 years, died on Wednesday at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 82.
        The News, reporting her death, said she had been ill with cancer.
        Ms. Gardella was born in Belleville, N.J., and graduated from the old Upsala College in East Orange. Two years later, in 1946, she took a job at The News as a copy girl and then became a writer covering crime and life style features.
        She was named radio and television editor in 1975 and became the television critic in 1981 and a weekly columnist in 1993. Her last column appeared on March 19.
        Ms. Gardella was married to Anthony Marino, a reporter and editor at The News who died several years ago. She leaves no immediate survivors.
