        Leslie Gourse, a prolific author best known for her biographies of a wide range of jazz musicians and singers, died on Dec. 23 at her home in Manhattan. She was 65.
        The cause was respiratory problems, said her cousin Melvin Zurier.
        The author or editor of more than 30 books, Ms. Gourse devoted most of her writing to profiles of jazz virtuosos, starting in 1984 with ''Louis' Children: American Jazz Singers,'' a collection of biographical sketches.
        Her most notable full-length biographies included ''Unforgettable: The Life and Mystique of Nat King Cole'' (1991), ''Sassy: The Life of Sarah Vaughan'' (1993) and ''Skain's Domain: A Biography'' (1999), which she wrote with the participation of its subject, Wynton Marsalis. She later chronicled the lives of Art Blakey (2001) and Carmen McRae (2002).
        The magazine Jazz Times named her biography ''Straight, No Chaser: The Life and Genius of Thelonious Monk'' (1997), one of the top jazz books of the year
        Her many books for children included at least six musical surveys along the lines of her 1998 book for young adults, ''Deep Down in Music: The Art of the Great Jazz Bassists.'' She also profiled performers like Mahalia Jackson and Gloria Estefan for a series of children's books published by Franklin Watts.
        Roberta Leslie Gourse was born on Jan. 1, 1939, in Fall River, Mass., and graduated from Columbia in 1960. She soon published ''With Gall and Honey,'' a novel depicting romance and self-discovery in Israel.
        She is survived by her mother, Zelda Fisher Gourse, of Providence, R.I.
