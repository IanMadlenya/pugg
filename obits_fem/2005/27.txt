        Mary Kim Joh, a composer and medical researcher, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan, said her son, Insoo Joh. She was 101.
        Ms. Joh is best known for ''School Bells,'' a 1945 anthem that must be learned by all students going into grammar school today in South Korea. She was asked by the South Korean government to compose children's songs after Japanese occupation ended and her nation was left with no Korean-language school materials.
        Born in Seoul, Ms. Joh attended American missionary schools and graduated from Ewha Women's University, where she eventually became director of the music department after earning a master's degree in music at the University of Michigan. She taught music theory and composition in the United States before switching her profession to microbiology and biochemistry, receiving a master's degree in science from Wayne State University. In 1977, at 73, she joined the Peace Corps and worked in Liberia, in a hospital 600 miles from Monrovia.
        She moved to New York in 1978 and worked with Korean-Americans there after Americans were evacuated from Liberia. In 1980 she received an honorary degree from Ewha for her humanitarian work in the United States and Africa, where she began a program called ''Spoons for Liberia,'' which sent sanitary utensils to the country in an effort to curb tropical diseases there. A program of financial grants was also established in her name to help talented teenagers become medical technicians.
        Distressed to find there were no books on Korean music in American libraries, Ms. Joh also wrote ''Folk Songs of Korea,'' published by Wm. C. Brown Company Publishers, Iowa, in 1950.
        Ms. Joh's husband, Owen, died in 1975. In addition to her son, Insoo, of Manhattan, she is survived by a daughter, Gwin Joh Chin, a magazine production editor at The New York Times, and a granddaughter, Andria Meredith, both of Manhattan, and a grandson, Eric, of Greensboro, N.C.
