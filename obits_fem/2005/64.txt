        Charlotte Kempner Beyers, a documentary filmmaker whose works were among the first to introduce students to the realities of AIDS, died on March 10 at her home in Palo Alto, Calif. She was 73.
        The cause was complications of lymphoma, her family said.
        The producer and writer of 15 films, Ms. Beyers began her career as a print journalist, writing about science and education for a variety of publications. She made her first film, ''AIDS in Your School,'' after a brother-in-law's death from AIDS in 1985. That film, along with her later ones about AIDS, was distributed to schools and youth groups by the World Health Organization.
        Ms. Beyers's other films include ''A Is for AIDS'' and ''AIDS and Women: The Greatest Gamble,'' as well as movies about drug abuse, disability and homelessness.
        Charlotte Kempner was born in Manhattan on Dec. 8, 1931; her father, S. Marshall Kempner, was a prominent investment banker. She earned a bachelor's degree in English from Stanford University in 1953 and a master's in journalism from Stanford in 1968.
        Ms. Beyers's first marriage, to Gerald Davis, ended in divorce. Her second husband, Robert West Beyers, died in 2002. She is survived by a sister, Phyllis Kempner; four children from her first marriage: Pamela Davis Kivelson, Nancy Stewart, Alan Davis and Cynthia Kanner; three stepchildren: Bill Beyers, Robbie Beyers and Amy Theorin; and 13 grandchildren and step-grandchildren.
