        Ellen Lentz, who reported from Berlin for The New York Times at the height of the cold war, died on April 10 at a hospital in Berlin. She was 88.
        The cause was heart failure, her son, Dr. Ulrich Lentz-Bartens, said.
        She was born in Berlin on Aug. 14, 1916, to a German father and a mother, Paula Pfingsthorn, who was half-American. After attending gymnasium, a college preparatory secondary school, Ms. Lentz went to work for The New York Herald Tribune. She later worked for the United Press. She joined The Times in 1959. After the Berlin Wall went up in 1961, she reported from West and East Berlin. She retired from The Times in 1981.
        Ms. Lentz was married twice, first to Gustav Adolf Lentz, an engineer who died in 1947, then to Dietrich Bartens, a radio correspondent. Besides her son, whom she had with her first husband and who lives in Kiel, Germany, she is survived by two grandchildren.
