        Sarah Jewler, the managing editor of New York magazine, died on Wednesday in Manhattan. She was 56.
        The cause was a rare blood disorder she had suffered with for many years, said her husband, Jay Kennedy.
        Ms. Jewler was a steady presence at the magazine even as it switched editors, owners and editorial approaches. She was hired as managing editor in 1994 by its editor at the time, Kurt Andersen, and continued to serve in that role under Caroline Miller and, more recently, Adam Moss.
        ''She was in many ways the emotional center of the magazine,'' said Ms. Miller, who left the magazine in February 2004. As managing editor, Ms. Jewler coordinated the practical parts of putting together a weekly, including negotiating writers' payments and contracts, devising annual budgets and ensuring the steady flow of articles.
        Sarah Jewler was born on May 18, 1948, in Washington and graduated from George Washington University. Before joining New York magazine, she worked at Manhattan Inc., The Village Voice and Rolling Stone with many of the more prominent editors of the last few decades, including Peter W. Kaplan and Clay Felker.
        ''When I met her, she exuded former hipster -- she had lived in communes and been a rock drummer,'' said Mr. Kaplan, who is now the editor of The New York Observer. ''She could make people fall into line by lifting an eyebrow,'' he added. She continued to work until last week.
        In addition to Mr. Kennedy, who is editor in chief of the King Features Syndicate, Ms. Jewler is survived by a brother, Leonard Jewler of Washington, and her mother, Esther Jewler of Silver Spring, Md.
