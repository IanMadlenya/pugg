        Shirley Fleming, a writer, editor and critic in the world of classical music for almost 50 years, died on Thursday in Augusta, Ga. She was 75.
        Her cousin Martha Fleming said she died at the University Hospital of the Medical College of Georgia after a stroke that she had on Feb. 17.
        Shirley Fleming had her most lasting effects on the music world behind the scenes. She was an editor for publications like Musical America, High Fidelity and Hi-Fi Music at Home, and most recently for American Record Guide. Many of classical music's active critics and writers received their first assignments from her. More or less steadily from 1978 until her death she was a music critic for The New York Post.
        Ms. Fleming was born in New York in 1929 but grew up in Augusta, where she kept strong ties. Robert Kimball, the music theater historian and a colleague of Ms. Fleming at The Post, remembers her reluctance to accept review assignments except on weekdays. Weekends she often returned home, and although she lived in Manhattan, she maintained a home in Augusta.
        Ms. Fleming's father was the distinguished Southern novelist Berry Fleming, who died in 1989 at 90. Popular in the 1930's and 40's, he published an admired comic novel, ''Captain Bennett's Folly,'' in 1989.
        Ms. Fleming was educated at Smith College, where she earned an undergraduate and then a master's degree. Her musical training was as a violist. Assigning articles and reviews around the country and indeed around the world, Ms. Fleming touched and influenced many lives. She was an only child and leaves no immediate survivors.
