        Ruth Levine Sussman, an acting New York State Supreme Court justice who organized and headed the state system's first Integrated Domestic Violence Court, in the Bronx, died on Aug. 26 at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 46.
        The cause was breast cancer, according to an announcement by Judith S. Kaye, chief judge of the Court of Appeals, who selected her in 2001 for the special panel, a pilot project for the state court system.
        Justice Sussman grew up in Schenectady, N.Y. She graduated from Smith College in 1980 and received her law degree from Georgetown University's School of Law in 1983, then became an assistant prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorney's office.
        Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani appointed her a Civil Court judge in 1995, after which she was assigned to Family Court and Criminal Court. She was named an acting justice of the State Supreme Court in 1999.
        The Integrated Domestic Violence Court was created by Chief Judge Kaye to bring before a single judge all court proceedings involving domestic violence cases. Those include criminal, family and matrimonial issues that, under the prevailing system, were divided among the Criminal Court, Family Court and Supreme Court.
        In her final days on the bench, in mid-June, Justice Sussman was conducting hearings under the Sex Offender Registration Act, known as Megan's Law, in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
        As she was being treated for her illness, Justice Sussman, helped by family and friends, raised money toward a Sussman Family Fund for research at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The center said that the effort had contributed more than $500,000 to its breast cancer programs.
        Justice Sussman is survived by her husband, David W. Sussman; their daughters, Jane and Rebecca; her parents, Judge Howard A. and Barbara Levine of Schenectady; and two brothers, Neil and James Levine, also of Schenectady.
