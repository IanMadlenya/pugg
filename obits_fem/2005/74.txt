        Carolyn Brady, an artist known for her large Photorealist watercolor paintings, died on May 5 at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. She was 67 and lived in New York City.
        The cause was complications after heart surgery, said her dealer in New York, Nancy Hoffman.
        Ms. Brady arrived at her signature style in the mid-1970's, when realism was enjoying a revival. She began painting flowers in vases, table settings and other scenes based on photographs that she took in and around her home. With their sharp focus, luminous colors and dimensions as great as 60 by 90 inches, her paintings have a hyper-realistic visual impact rarely encountered in the medium of watercolor.
        Carolyn Brady was born on May 22, 1937, in Chickasha, Okla. She received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in painting from the University of Oklahoma in Norman in 1959 and went on to earn her Master of Fine Arts degree at the same school in 1961. She had her first solo exhibition in 1975 at Nancy Singer Gallery in St. Louis and the first of many New York solo shows at Nancy Hoffman Gallery in SoHo in 1977.
        Ms. Brady's works are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington; and the Art Institute of Chicago, among numerous other institutions.
        Ms. Brady is survived by her husband, the sculptor Bill Epton, and her son, Alexander Brady Epton, both of New York City.
