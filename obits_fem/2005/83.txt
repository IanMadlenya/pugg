        Annie Toglia, who developed a physical rehabilitation program for women with breast cancer, died in Mount Kisco, N.Y. on Wednesday. She was 56.
        Her family said the cause was complications of the disease.
        When Ms. Toglia learned she had late-stage breast cancer in 1996, she had a private practice in sports medicine fitness training. After undergoing several operations, aggressive treatment and years of physical therapy, she left her practice to become a medical exercise specialist and advocate for breast cancer awareness.
        She developed a special exercise program to help survivors recover and maintain their health after surgery.
        She wrote ''Staying Abreast: Rehabilitation Exercises for Breast Cancer Surgery,'' a guide that is available on her Web site, www.stayingabreast.com.
