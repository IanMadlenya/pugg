        Anne Cox, a New York socialite who designed high fashion for high society in the 1950's and became the mother-in-law of a president's daughter, died on Tuesday in Westhampton Beach, N.Y. She was 86 and a resident of Palm Beach, Fla.
        The cause was Lewy body disease, a form of dementia similar to Alzheimer's, her son Howard said.
        Mrs. Cox offered her own designs in a boutique on 57th Street in Manhattan. She was also an occasional fashion and society columnist for The Herald Tribune and a fashion adviser for Bergdorf Goodman. Later she worked as a real estate developer in the Hamptons.
        Mrs. Cox was descended on her mother's side from the socially prominent Livingston family. She was a patron of charities, including the Association for the Relief of Respectable, Aged, Indigent Females, of which she was president, and she was long the chairwoman or a co-chairwoman of the annual International Debutante Ball.
        Anne Delafield Finch Cox was born in Westhampton Beach on March 13, 1918, and graduated from the Chapin School, where she was later a trustee and president of the alumnae association.
        Her husband, Howard Ellis Cox, a New York lawyer, died in 1989. In addition to her son Howard Ellis Jr. of Boston, she is survived by a daughter, Mazie Livingston Delafield Cox of Northampton, Mass.; another son, Edward, who is married to Tricia Nixon, of Manhattan; a brother, Edward Ridley Finch Jr. of Manhattan; and three grandchildren.
