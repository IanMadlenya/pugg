        Helen Jackson Wilkins Claytor, a pivotal figure in the racial desegregation of the Y.W.C.A. and its first African-American president, died yesterday in Grand Rapids, Mich. She was 98.
        Her death was announced by her son, Roger Wilkins, the Robinson professor of history and American culture at George Mason University.
        Mrs. Claytor, a longtime civil rights leader in Grand Rapids, served two terms, from 1967 to 1976, as national president of the Young Women's Christian Association. As a board member and a national organizer since the 1940's, she had been a strong force in the racial integration of the organization at all levels.
        Helen Natalie Jackson was born in Minneapolis and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Minnesota in 1928. She went to work for what was then the separate ''Negro'' branch of the segregated Y.W.C.A. in Kansas City, Mo., and stayed there until the death in 1941 of her first husband, Earl Wilkins, a journalist.
        She then joined the newly established race relations office of the national Y.W.C.A. in New York. As secretary for interracial education, she traveled throughout the South in a campaign to desegregate the local Y's.
        She became a member of the Y.W.C.A.'s board in 1945. Once she was national president, she oversaw the adoption of an amendment to the organization's constitution that buttressed the changes she had helped bring about. Its main provision warned that any local affiliate not ''fully integrated in policy and practice'' would be expelled for not living up to the Y's principles.
        Mrs. Claytor moved to Grand Rapids in 1943 after her marriage to her second husband, Dr. Robert Claytor, a physician, who died in 1993.
        Besides her son, who lives in Washington, she is survived by two daughters from her second marriage, Judith A. Claytor of Grand Rapids, and Sharon Claytor Peters of Lansing, Mich.; five grandchildren, and one great-grandson.
