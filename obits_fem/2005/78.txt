        Elisabeth Fraser, a versatile character actress with a 40-year career on stage, screen and, most enduringly, television, died on May 5 at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 85 and lived in Los Angeles.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, said her daughter Meg McDonald Seltzer.
        One of her longer-lasting roles was that of Sgt. Joan Hogan, the long-suffering sidekick of the wisecracking Master Sgt. Ernest G. Bilko on the ''Phil Silvers Show'' in the 1950's.
        Ms. Fraser was accidentally discovered by Alfred Lunt and Robert E. Sherman, running into them when she hastily exited from the wrong stage at an open casting call.
        She had her Broadway debut in 1940 in Robert Sherwood's ''There Shall Be No Night,'' and she also won a Hollywood studio contract. She appeared in six Broadway shows and had supporting roles in more than 30 movies.
        Later film and television audiences may remember her as a perky blonde playing brassy dames. She appeared in episodes of shows including ''Maude,'' ''Mannix,'' ''Perry Mason,'' ''Ben Casey,'' ''Dragnet,'' ''Four Star Playhouse'' and ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents.''
        She was born Elisabeth Fraser Jonker in Brooklyn. Her marriages to Ray McDonald, a dancer, and Charles K. Peck Jr., a screenwriter, ended in divorce. (Mr. McDonald died in 1959; Mr. Peck in 1996.)
        Besides her daughter Meg, a resident of Los Angeles, she is survived by two other daughters, Pat McDonald Zavad of Palmdale, Calif., and Liza Mc Donald of Los Angeles.
