        Georgia Macris, an editor of influential energy industry publications for three decades, died on Jan. 13 at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 86.
        The cause was lung cancer, her sister, Sophie Hocknell, said.
        Ms. Macris graduated from Radcliffe College in 1940. She joined the Red Cross and served in the Pacific during World War II.
        She was hired by McGraw-Hill World News in New York in 1947. When McGraw-Hill began publishing Petroleum Week magazine in 1955, she was named an assistant editor and then, a year later, foreign news editor. In 1961, she was named foreign news editor of Platts Oilgram News, a newsletter published by McGraw-Hill.
        In 1968, Ms. Macris moved to Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, a newsletter that was then independently published by Wanda Jablonski and is now part of the Energy Intelligence Group. Ms. Macris served as managing editor from 1970 and as editor from 1972, retiring in 1983.
        Ms. Macris chronicled the transformation of the international oil industry from the 1950's. She charted how the business evolved from one dominated by major corporations to one controlled by the nationalized companies in the 1970's.
        Ms. Macris is survived by her sister, Ms. Hocknell, of Salem, Mass.
