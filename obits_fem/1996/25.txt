        Razia Bhatti, a Pakistani editor who championed social causes and campaigned  against Government corruption, died on Tuesday at her home in Karachi. She was 52 and the founding editor of Newsline, Pakistan's most influential political monthly.
        Colleagues said Mrs. Bhatti, who suffered from high blood pressure, died of a brain hemorrhage.
        In the political turmoil of Pakistan and the violent chaos of Karachi, Mrs.  Bhatti and her magazine represented a consistent voice for democracy, social improvement and the freedom to publish unpopular views.
        Her death came just seven months after Mrs. Bhatti stared down police officers who invaded her home after her magazine had published an article critical of the Governor of the province around Karachi.
        Ordered to report to a police station where criminal charges had been filed at the Governor's behest, Mrs. Bhatti refused to comply. In the furor that followed, the charges were quietly withdrawn.
        No one who knew her was surprised by her defiance. She and her magazine had withstood so many similar efforts at intimidation that a year earlier she received a Courage in Journalism award from the International Women's Media Foundation in Washington.
        In a country where editors and reporters are subject to threats and violence, Newsline owed its existence to Government censorship.
        It was founded in 1989 after Mrs. Bhatti resigned as editor of The Herald, a  magazine affiliated with Pakistan's largest newspaper group, rather than soften  its attacks on what Mrs. Bhatti saw as untenable policies and corruption. Several women who had worked for her at The Herald followed her and helped her found Newsline as an independent staff-owned magazine.
        She is survived by her husband, Gul Hameed Bhatti; two children, Kamil and Sara; a sister, Fareeda Boudrey, and three brothers, Karim, Rahim and Rafeeg Boudry, all of Karachi.
