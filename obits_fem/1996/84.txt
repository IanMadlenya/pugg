        Dorothy Hyson, a Chicago-born stage and screen actress of the 1930's and 40's who was famed for her beauty, died on Thursday in a London hospital. She was 81  and had moved to London with her parents as a child.
        She had been in declining health after suffering a stroke, The Times of London reported.
        Miss Hyson's second husband, the actor and director Sir Anthony Quayle, once remarked: "It was not only her beauty that possessed me. It was a radiant lightness of heart."
        She was often said to have inspired the 1935 Rodgers and Hart hit song "The Most Beautiful Girl in the World," with what The Guardian on Saturday called "her blue eyes, blond hair, and fragile singing and dancing style."
        Miss Hyson made her screen debut as a child in the movie "Money Mad" and her  stage debut in London in a 1927 play, "Quality Street," by J. M. Barrie.
        The Daily Telegraph said that on the London stage she "scored her greatest triumph in the thriller 'Pink String and Sealing Wax,' " which opened in 1943.
        Her first marriage, to the actor Robert Douglas, ended in divorce. Sir Anthony died in 1989. Her mother, the musical-comedy star Dorothy Dickson, died  last year at the age of 102.
        Miss Hyson is survived by two daughters and a son.
