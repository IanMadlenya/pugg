        Anne Spivey Woodward, a museum director and former administrator of Brandywine Battlefield Park in Pennsylvania, died on Tuesday at Chester County Hospital in West Chester, Pa. A West Chester resident, she was 47.
        The cause was breast cancer, her family said.
        Born in Decatur, Ga., Mrs. Woodward graduated from Mount Holyoke College in  1971 and earned a master's degree in history at the University of Delaware in 1973. That year she started her career as a director and museum curator for the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission.
        She researched and oversaw the historical furnishings of Washington's Headquarters at Valley Forge for its Bicentennial restoration. She continued to  work for the commission as regional curator and administrator of the park at Brandywine Creek until 1989.
        In 1977 and 1987 she had a major role in the 200th and 210th anniversary re-enactments of the Battle of the Brandywine, in which Washington's troops failed to check a British advance on Philadelphia. From 1989 until two years ago she served as the museum director of the Historical Society of Delaware.
        Mrs. Woodward is survived by her husband, Roland H. Woodward; three daughters, E. Rebecca, 17, Hannah C., 13, and Sarah M., 9; her parents, Albert G. Spivey Jr. and Jane K. Spivey of Kennett Square, Pa., and her sister, J. Carlisle Spivey of Greenwich, Conn.
