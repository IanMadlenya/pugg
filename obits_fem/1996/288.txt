        Barbara Yuncker, a prize-winning science reporter for The New York Post and a longtime leader of the Newspaper Guild, died yesterday. She was 74 and had homes in Manhattan and Canaan, N.Y.
        The cause was breast cancer, said her sister, Betty Yuncker Lee.
        Ms. Yuncker was twice winner of the prestigious Albert Lasker Award for science writing: in 1966, for a series on the birth-control pill, and in 1968, for a series on the human brain. In 1979, she won a Matrix leadership award from Women in Communications. In her career at The Post, from 1945 to 1986, she  also won local Newspaper Guild Page One and New York Newswomen's Club awards.
        Ms. Yuncker, who was born in Greencastle, Ind., graduated from DePauw University in 1943. In 1943, she joined The Wall Street Journal, the first woman to be a copy editor there. She moved to the Post copy desk in 1946, and in 1959  became a science and medical reporter. Later, she was medicine-science editor.
        She left newspapers for a year in 1956-57, when she was Deputy Commissioner of the State Commerce Department, writing reports for women working outside the  home.
        She was elected guild unit chairwoman at The Post in 1976, while Dorothy Schiff was publisher. When Rupert Murdoch bought the paper in 1977, she became the first Murdoch employee to lead a bargaining committee against the publisher. In 1981, she became a member of the guild's international executive board.
        She retired from The Post in 1986.
        She is survived by her sister, of Boynton Beach, Fla., two nephews and a niece.
