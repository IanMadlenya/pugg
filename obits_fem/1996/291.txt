        Helen Wilson, a staunch advocate of patients' rights as administrator for the Association of the Attending Staff at Mount Sinai Medical Center, died yesterday at the hospital. Mrs. Wilson, who lived on the Upper East Side, was 82.
        The cause was cancer, a daughter, Victoria Wilson, said.
        Working with the practicing physicians at Mount Sinai for more than 20 years, Mrs. Wilson was a champion of better patient care and increased respect for nurses.
        Mrs. Wilson retired in 1984. At the time, she held the titles of secretary to the medical board, secretary to the board of trustees and head of the medical staff services office, in addition to that of administrator for the Association  of the Attending Staff.
        The Association of the Attending Staff persuaded Mrs. Wilson to stay on, and  she continued as the organization's administrator until her death.
        Mrs. Wilson joined Mount Sinai in 1962 as administrative assistant to the director of nurses. After a few years, she left briefly to work as a theater producer, but she returned in the late 60's and remained.
        Mrs. Wilson was born in Manhattan and educated at the Dalton School, the University of Wisconsin and Hunter College.
        Always an activist, she was involved in anti-Fascist causes during the Spanish Civil War, supported Russian War Relief and was often seen on picket lines.
        In the early 1950's, after her marriage to the novelist and physicist Mitchell Wilson, which was to end in divorce, the couple lived on Martha's Vineyard for several years.
        At that time, Mrs. Wilson gave up her work as administrative assistant to the president of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, and with her husband founded the Martha's Vineyard Little Theater, where they produced and directed plays.
        In addition to her daughter Victoria, of Manhattan, Mrs. Wilson is survived by another daughter, Erica Silverman, also of Manhattan.
