        Louisa James Calder, widow of the sculptor Alexander Calder, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91.
        Mrs. Calder, born in 1905 in Seattle, was a great-niece of Henry, William and Alice James. She met her future husband during a trans-Atlantic voyage. The couple married in 1931 and moved to Paris.
        Mrs. Calder executed a series of hooked rugs, based on her husband's designs, and wrote a book on crochet.
        She received the United Nations Woman of the Year Award in 1975.
        In 1977, two months after her husband's death, she declined to attend White House ceremonies honoring him to press for blanket amnesty for opponents of the Vietnam War.
        She is survived by two daughters, Sandra Davidson of France and New York, and Mary Rower of New York and Connecticut; four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.
