        Ruth Adams Paepcke, former editor in chief of America Illustrated, the Russian-language magazine about American life that the United States Information Agency sent to the Soviet Union during the cold war, died on Tuesday at Washington Hospital Center in Washington. She was 79 and lived in Washington.
        Mrs. Paepcke, who was widely known by her maiden name, Ruth Adams, was the head editor of the magazine in the early 1960's. It was published monthly, and by agreement with the Soviet Union it was distributed there in return for the distribution in the United States of a Soviet magazine, Soviet Life.
        She is survived by a stepson, Eric Pace of Manhattan, a reporter for The New York Times; a stepdaughter, Ursula Jackson of Houston, and four stepgrandchildren.
