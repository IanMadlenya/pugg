        The Rev. Betita Cabrera Coty, a Nicaraguan-born evangelical minister and community leader who fasted for four weeks in an effort to end a teachers' strike in Oakland, Calif., early this year, died on Saturday at her home in Oakland. She was 50.
        The cause was cancer, The Associated Press reported.
        Ms. Coty was with the Shiloh Christian Fellowship church in Oakland. In her two decades in Oakland, she also did organizational work to combat crime against women and other violence in the city. She was an advocate of homeless people's rights and worked with AIDS patients.
        During the teachers' strike, she fasted in a tent across the street from the school district's administration building. The strikers returned to work after the board agreed, in March, to a new contract giving teachers smaller classes and a substantial raise.
        She was born in Managua, Nicaragua, came to the United States in the early 1960's, graduated from Shiloh Bible College in Oakland and spent seven years in San Francisco, where she set up a street ministry, before moving to Oakland in the 1970's.
        She is survived by her mother, Zaida De Unamuno of San Francisco; two children, Steve Coty of Stockton, Calif., and Lisa Hansen of Newark, Calif.; two sisters, Hedy Manthey of Delaware and Selma Hurtado of San Francisco, and two grandchildren.
