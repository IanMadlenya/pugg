        Vivian Robinson, the founder of the Audience Development Committee (Audelco) and the annual Audelco Awards, which honors achievement in black theater, died on Sept. 16 at North General Hospital in Harlem. She was 71.
        The cause was heart failure, said Fred Powell, chairman of the board of Audelco.
        Miss Robinson was born in Portsmouth, Va. While working in the advertising department of The Amsterdam News, she noticed that many small theater companies were not being covered and volunteered to review their productions for the newspaper. In 1973, she created Audelco ''to generate recognition, understanding and awareness of the arts in black communities and to build new audiences for nonprofit theaters and dance companies.''
        For 23 years, the Audelco ceremony has been an annual event in the New York theater, with awards presented to playwrights, actors, directors, composers, designers and theater companies. Under Miss Robinson's direction, Audelco has also sponsored a series of Black Theater Festivals.
        She is survived by her sister, Joan Rodriquez of Yonkers.
