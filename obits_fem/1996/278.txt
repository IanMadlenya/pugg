        Elizabeth Ege Freudenheim, a freelance writer and author who specialized in writing about crafts, textiles and the arts, died yesterday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 70.
        The cause was ovarian cancer, said her husband, Milt, who is a reporter for The New York Times.
        After starting her career in Ohio as a curator at the Akron Art Institute, she began to contribute articles to The Chicago Daily News and The International Herald Tribune in Paris. Later, using Betty Freudenheim as her byline, she regularly contributed columns on crafts to The New York Times and wrote for magazines like American Crafts and Fiber Arts. With Jack Lenor Larsen, she was co-author of ''Interlacing: The Elemental Fabric.''
        Besides her husband of 44 years, Mrs. Freudenehim is survived by two daughters, Jo Frisch of Buffalo and Susan Core of Los Angeles; two sons, John M. and Tom, both of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
