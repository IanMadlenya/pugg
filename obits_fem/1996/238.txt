        Ruth Diebold, a librarian who combined her professional interests with a personal dedication to culinary pursuits and so helped to preserve the legacy of James Beard, apostle of American cookery, died on Tuesday at her home in Upper Nyack, N.Y. She was 77.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, her family said.
        At her death Mrs. Diebold was vice president of the Nyack Library. She also was a former director. After Mr. Beard died in 1985, she volunteered to turn his Greenwich Village town house into a center for culinary arts.
        She was a graduate of the University of Chicago and obtained a master's degree in library science from Columbia University.
        She is survived by her husband, William Diebold; four sons, David Corcoran of Northvale, N.J., John Corcoran of Red Hook, N.Y.; John Diebold of Nyack, and William Diebold of Portland, Ore.; a daughter, Barbara Wick of Northfield, Ill.; a brother, Joseph Brody of Indianapolis; 11 grandchildren, and 2 great-grandchildren.
