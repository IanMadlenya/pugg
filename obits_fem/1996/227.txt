        Barbara C. Salken, a professor at the Pace University School of Law in White Plains, died on Oct. 17 at Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla. She was 49 and lived in Chappaqua, N.Y.
        She suffered a long illness, according to the law school, where she had taught criminal law and procedure for 13 years. For three of the last seven years, she was voted the outstanding professor of the year by the graduating class, most recently at the 1996 commencement.
        Professor Salken, who was a native of Richmond and a graduate of Skidmore College and Brooklyn Law School, first practiced with the Legal Aid Society in New York City. She was associated with its criminal defense division and then with the special litigation unit, where she supervised law-reform work and class-action litigation, taking part in cases that dealt with the treatment of youthful criminal offenders.
        As an active member of the Association of the Bar of New York City, she served on its council on criminal justice and as chairwoman of the committee on criminal justice.
        Professor Salken is survived by her husband, Matthew Rosen; a son, Billy; a sister, Judy Salken of Mahopac, N.Y., and her parents, Doris and Irvin Salken of Williamsburg, Va.
