        Hildegarde Fillmore Smith, a former fashion and beauty editor at the women's magazine McCall's, died on Monday in her garret apartment at the National Arts Club on Gramercy Park South.
        She was 98 and had lived at the club for the last 43 years.
        A native of Cincinnati and a graduate of the University of Cincinnati, she came to New York City as an aspiring poet and settled into a career in publishing instead.
        In addition to editing, she worked as a Hollywood correspondent. She also served on the Board of Governors of the Fashion Group and on the committee for the American Fashion Critics Award.
        After retiring in 1953 she became active in the National Arts Club, editing its bulletin and serving as its  secretary for more than a decade.
        She is survived by a sister, Chalma Mathewson of Cincinnati.
