        At her death, Mrs. Frelinghuysen was on the board of the Berkshire Botanical  Garden in Stockbridge, Mass. In the 1980's, she was on the board of the National Tropical Botanical Garden in Hawaii.
        In addition, she was for some years a member of the advisory committee of the School of American Ballet, which is part of the Lincoln Center complex.
        Mrs. Frelinghuysen was a native of Manhattan, the daughter of Rodney Procter, a stockbroker and investor, and the former Beatrice Sterling.
        Besides her husband of 56 years and her sons Peter, of Manhattan, and Rodney, of Morristown, she is survived by another son, Frederick, of Tucson, Ariz.; two  daughters, Beatrice van Roijen of Washington and Adaline Ogilvie-Laing of Manhattan, 13 grandchildren and a sister, Mrs. Anson Phelps Stokes Jr.
