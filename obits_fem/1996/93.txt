        Honor R. Holland, who served as a British Army officer with the future Queen  in World War II and as a high Government official in Imperial Ethiopia, died last Monday in Saratoga Hospital in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. She was 79 and lived  in Saratoga Springs.
        The cause was pneumonia, said Timothy Holmes, a friend.
        Miss Holland was born in London, the daughter of a British major and an Ethiopian princess. She lived in Switzerland as a young woman but returned to Britain at the outbreak of war to join the Auxiliary Territorial Service of the  British Army.
        She served in the same unit as the Princess Royal, now Queen Elizabeth II, and her sister, Princess Margaret. She rose to the rank of captain and, after the war, entered the diplomatic service in London.
        She had met the exiled Emperor Haile Selassie, whose family were guests of Britain's royal family during the Italian occupation of Ethiopia. At his invitation, she went to Ethiopia in the late 1950's.
        There, as an official in the Ministry of Education, she helped build the English-language University College into what became Addis Ababa University. She also served as civilian head of the country's modest navy and co-founded a magazine, Ethiopian Woman.
        While in Ethiopia, an American cousin invited her to America, where she stayed. After moving to Saratoga Springs in 1982, she was active in the League of Women Voters and the Saratoga Springs Urban Cultural Park.
