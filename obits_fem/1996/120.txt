        Delia Goetz, whose travels as an education specialist for the United States Government provided her with material for more than a score of children's books, died on June 26 at her home in Washington. She was 100.
        Mrs. Goetz, who was born in Wesley, Iowa, attended Iowa State Teachers College and then went abroad to teach at schools in Panama, Cuba and Guatemala.  During World War II she worked in Latin America for the United States Office of  Education, eventually joining that agency and remaining on its staff from 1946 to 1961.
        Her first book was "Neighbors to the South" (1941), an introduction to 12 Latin American countries. She followed that with "Panchita, a Little Girl of Guatemala," the first of her many books for young readers. Her other works include "The Dragon and the Eagle," "The Hidden Burro" and "Other Young Americans." She was also the translator, with Sylvanus G. Morley, of "Popol Vuh," a Mayan Indian folk tale.
        No immediate family members survive.
