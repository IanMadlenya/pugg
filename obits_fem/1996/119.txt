        Bertha Schizer, who started working as a pharmacist in Brooklyn when that profession was dominated by men, died on July 3 at University Hospital in Brooklyn. A longtime Brooklyn resident, she was 102.
        Mrs. Schizer was born in Bialystok, in what is now Poland, and she came to the United States with her family after an organized persecution of Jews there in 1905. She was a descendant of generations of Hebrew scholars and teachers.
        She graduated from Long Island University College of Pharmacy in 1918 and was active in her profession for more than 50 years.
        Mrs. Schizer worked in pharmacies and hospital dispensaries in various parts  of the borough, retiring from a pharmacy in Flatbush in the mid-1970's.
        Mrs. Schizer is survived by a son, Zevie B., and four grandchildren. Her husband, David Schizer, died in 1960.
