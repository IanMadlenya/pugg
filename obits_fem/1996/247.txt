        Joan Paterson Kerr, a picture editor and author, died yesterday at her home in New Haven. She was 75.
        The cause was cancer, her family said.
        Mrs. Kerr was a founding picture editor of American Heritage magazine. She was a co-editor of ''American Album,'' published by American Heritage, and ''The Romantic Egoists,'' a pictorial history of F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. She also was a picture editor at Newsweek Books and for the Book-of-the-Month Club series ''The American Past.''
        Mrs. Kerr also compiled ''A Bully Father: Theodore Roosevelt's Letters to His Children'' (1995), for which she wrote the biographical essay and notes.
        She is survived by her husband, Chester, former director of the Yale University Press; two daughters, Hilary Mills Loomis of Manhattan and Alley Mills Bean of Los Angeles; a son, Tony Mills of Oakland, Calif., and two grandchildren.
