        Carolyn Eugenia Agger, a prominent tax lawyer and the widow of former Justice Abe Fortas of the Supreme Court, died on Thursday at her home in the Georgetown section of Washington. She was 87.
        The cause was pneumonia, said the Washington law firm Arnold & Porter, where she retired two years ago as a senior partner and head of the tax practice section.
        Ms. Agger was at the center of a rebellion that ruffled the world of big-ticket law offices in 1960 when she led an exodus of partners from the firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. A partner in the firm's Washington office, she defected to Arnold, Fortas & Porter and took the entire Washington office with her.
        At the time, Mr. Fortas was a member of the firm, now known as Arnold & Porter. And he was loath to give up his lucrative partnership when President Lyndon B. Johnson tried to cajole him into joining the Court in 1965. Mr. Fortas refused several times, but Mr. Johnson was not one to take no for an answer.
        The assent to the bench meant a sharp financial loss, to $39,500 from an estimated yearly salary of $200,000, something that Mr. Fortas openly derided. It also angered Ms. Agger, suddenly the couple's principal breadwinner by far. It was Mr. Fortas, an Associate Justice from 1965 until resigning in 1969, who steered her into a legal career after their marriage in 1935.
        Carolyn Eugenia Agger, who was born in New York City, graduated from Barnard College in 1931. After obtaining a master's degree in economics in 1932 at the University of Wisconsin, she worked in staff positions at various New Deal agencies.
        She graduated from Yale Law School in 1938 and went into private practice when few women did. She was associated with Lord, Day & Lord and then advanced to a full partnership in Paul, Weiss before moving to Arnold, Fortas & Porter.
        Mr. Fortas died in 1982 after 47 years of marriage. There are no immediate survivors.
