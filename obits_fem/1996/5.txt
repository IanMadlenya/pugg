        Louise Rorimer-Dushkin, a prominent supporter of Manhattan's settlement houses, died on Wednesday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Santa Fe, N.M. She was 85 and had moved to Santa Fe from the Upper East Side three years ago.
        Mrs. Rorimer-Dushkin was a founder, in 1964, and past chairwoman of the Harlem School of the Arts, a nonprofit school that offers courses in art, dance, music and drama. She was also a board member, since 1953, of Greenwich House, a  neighborhood support center in Greenwich Village. She remained active there into her 80's.
        She was the widow of Samuel Dushkin, the concert violinist, who died in 1976 after 40 years of marriage, and a sister of James Rorimer, former director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
        Mrs. Rorimer-Dushkin is survived by her daughter, Edie Soeiro of Santa Fe, and two grandchildren.
