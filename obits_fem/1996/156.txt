        Dr. Inge Komers Broverman, a psychologist known for her studies of persistent sexual stereotypes, died on Aug. 12 at Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara, Calif., where she was on the staff of the Fielding Institute. She was 65 and lived in nearby Carpinteria.
        The cause was cancer, her family said.
        Dr. Broverman and her collaborators did their research at Worcester State Hospital in Massachusetts in the 1960's. For a widely discussed paper published in 1970, they asked a relatively large sample of 79 therapists to define the psychological characteristics of a mature, healthy, socially competent man, woman or ''adult person.''
        Their replies described the healthy man and healthy adult almost identically as active, independent, adventurous and logical. The healthy woman, by contrast, was described as more dependent, emotional, subjective, passive and illogical, characteristics ascribed to ''unhealthy'' adult.
        Women, the research indicated, thus were in a double bind because an active, logical and independent woman would have to be sick by definition, under the terms used by the respondents.
        Dr. Broverman received a doctorate in psychology from Clark University in Worcester in 1961. She then worked as a research psychologist at Worcester State Hospital until 1978.
        Dr. Broverman went on to be an associate professor at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, becoming director of the psychology service in 1980. In 1985 she became an associate dean of the psychology program at the Fielding Institute, a graduate school offering degrees in clinical psychology and related subjects.
        Dr. Broverman is survived by a son, Clifford, of Worcester; a daughter, Sherryl A. Broverman-Wray of Stony Brook, L.I., and two grandchildren.
