        Kathleen Haberthur-Williams, a theatrical press agent, died on Wednesday in the burn unit of New York University-Cornell Medical Center. She was 41 and lived in Brooklyn.
        The cause was complications of severe burns suffered in an accident at her home on April 27, said Philip Rinaldi, a colleague.
        Ms. Haberthur-Williams began her career as a press agent in music and theater in her home town, Detroit, notably at the Chene Park Music Theater. She was also the in-house press agent for the Fisher and Masonic Temple theaters, owned by the Nederlander Organization.
        After moving to New York City in 1992, she worked as a press agent for Broadway, Off Broadway and national touring productions, including the 1994 revival of "Medea," "Blood Brothers," "Pounding Nails in the Floor With My Forehead" and "The Night Larry Kramer Kissed Me."
        From 1993 to 1995, she handled publicity for Here, a performing arts center in SoHo. Most recently, she worked on the national tour of "Ain't Misbehavin',"  with the Pointer Sisters.
        She is survived by her husband, Steve Williams; a daughter, Sarah Haberthur;  her parents, Margaret and Charles Buchanan, of Winter Haven, Fla., and three brothers, Charles Buchanan of Winter Haven and Ross and Keith Buchanan, both of  Palm Beach, Fla.
