        Virginia Donaldson, the press agent for the New York City Ballet from 1966 to 1982, died on Wednesday at her home in Chicago. She was 74.
        The cause was heart failure, said Jack Hakman, a friend.
        Ms. Donaldson worked with City Ballet during the years of some of its greatest triumphs, helping to create press campaigns for the Stravinsky Festivals of 1972 and 1982, the Ravel Festival of 1979 and the Tchaikovsky Festival of 1981.
        Ms. Donaldson, who was born in Chicago, fell in love with ballet as a child.  Early ballet classes led to a friendship with the choreographer Leonide Massine  and his family, which in turn led to her career as a press agent. In addition to press work for Massine, she also worked for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo and  several other troupes, including American Ballet Theater.
        After her retirement from City Ballet, she did freelance work with the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, the Old Globe Theater in San Diego and Maria Tallchief's Ballet Chicago, and made herself available for informal assistance to ballet companies coming through Chicago.
        There are no immediate survivors.
