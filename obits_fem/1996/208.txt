        Eleanor Frances Cameron, an award-winning writer of children's books, died on Friday at Hospice House in Monterey, Calif. She was 84 and lived in Pebble Beach, Calif.
        Mrs. Cameron was the author of 17 children's books. She began her writing career in 1950 with ''The Unheard Music,'' her one book for adults, and published her first children's book, ''The Wonderful Flight to the Mushroom Planet,'' in 1954. That book, an adventure about space travel, inspired four ''Mushroom Planet'' sequels.
        ''The Court of the Stone Children'' (1973), a complex tale involving ghostly apparitions in modern-day San Francisco, won her a National Book Award. She was a semifinalist for the award in 1979, for ''To the Green Mountains.'' Her other books include ''The Green and Burning Tree,'' ''The Beast With the Magical Horn,'' ''The Mysterious Christmas Shell'' and ''A Room Made of Windows,'' about a girl's journey to becoming a writer.
        Mrs. Cameron was born in 1912, in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Her family moved to Ohio when she was 3, and then to California.
        She is survived by a son, David, of Santa Monica, Calif.
