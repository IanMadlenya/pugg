        Rosalie Ulrich Rosenberger, who practiced law in Nassau County for nearly seven decades, starting even before the county bar association admitted women, died on Sunday at South Nassau Community Hospital in Oceanside, L.I. She was 97 and a 60-year resident of Rockville Centre.
        A woman ahead of her time, she carried on a general practice in Rockville Centre under her maiden name of Rosalie Ulrich until she retired about six years ago. She was long active in community affairs, especially low-income housing and the welfare of the elderly.
        She was born and reared in Manhattan and received her law degree from Cornell University in 1921. She was admitted to the state bar two years later. She began her practice then, but the Nassau County bar refused to admit her when she applied in 1938. Undeterred, she was among the founders of the Nassau County Women's Bar Association. In fairly short order, the men who ran the county bar opened their ranks to female lawyers.
        Her community interests prompted Mrs. Rosenberger to form the Better Housing Committee of Rockville Centre in 1953, which campaigned for affordable housing for less affluent families. She then served as chairwoman of the local housing authority, until the early 1960's. In those years she helped develop the Halandia housing project for senior citizens in Rockville Centre, one of the first such centers in the county.
        In her law practice, Mrs. Rosenberger worked on behalf of youthful offenders, and she later served as a law guardian in the Nassau County Children's Court before the establishment of Family Court in Westbury.
        She also was a president of the Nassau Senior Forum and the National Council of Jewish Women.
        She is survived by two daughters, Susan Peters of Deer Park, L.I., and Betty Roberts of Stamford, Conn.; five grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
