        Grace E. Bessay, who won a prolonged legal struggle to keep the Federal Government from ousting her from a two-room summer shanty on Cape Cod, died on Oct. 10 in Cambridge, Mass. where she had her main home for 50 years. She was 84.
        Her death was reported yesterday by The Associated Press. The cause of death and where in Cambridge she died were not disclosed.
        Ms. Bessay, a retired bookkeeper, reached agreement with the National Park Service in 1991 -- shortly before she was to be evicted -- to settle her lawsuit.
        Under the settlement, she received a cash settlement and permission to keep on using the primitive cottage -- her longtime summer home, on an eight-acre site -- for 25 more years.
        ''I'll be making use of it for all the 25 years,'' she said triumphantly.
        Her shanty was one of 17 simple cottages on a small compound, in the dunes of Truro and Provincetown, within the 43,000-acre Cape Cod National Seashore. The cottages were once retreats for writers like E. E. Cummings, Jack Kerouac, Norman Mailer and Eugene O'Neill.
        In 1967, the National Park Service claimed the structures as part of the Cape Cod National Seashore. The owners of 16 cottages later signed agreements with the Park Service that let them continue using them for 25 additional years.
        But the 17th owner, Andrew Fuller, declined to sign and continued a lawsuit. He died in 1981, and Ms. Bessay, a longtime friend, inherited his shanty and the suit. Just before she settled it, she declared: ''I'm looking for security so they can't come and throw me out.''
        Ms. Bessay was born in Akron, Ohio, received a degree from Akron University and also studied at Radcliffe College.
