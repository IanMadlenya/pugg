        Dr. Roma Gans, an emeritus professor of education at Teachers College of Columbia University who wrote several classic texts on teaching children to read, died on Oct. 4 at the Springside Nursing Home in Pittsfield, Mass. She was 102.
        In books and lectures, Dr. Gans urged teachers to inspire children by  reading to them, and introducing them to reading materials on hobbies and subjects of interest to them. She disagreed with teachers and parents who dismissed the benefits of play, taking the position that it was significant to early development.
        Among her books on teaching reading are several texts still in use, including ''Guiding Children's Reaching Through Experience,'' published by Teachers College in 1942, and ''Common Sense in Teaching Reading'' (Bobbs-Merrill, 1963).
        Dr. Gans, who was born in St. Cloud, Minn., graduated from Columbia University and in 1929 joined the faculty at Teachers College, from which she received a Ph.D. in 1940. The school estimates that 1,000 students passed through her classes at the college each year.
        After retiring from the classroom in 1959, she became a prolific author of children's books in a science series for Crowell Company, ''Let's Read and Find Out,'' many of which remain in print.
        Dr. Gans aimed her books at the youngest readers, explaining matters that might fascinate kindergartners. The titles ranged from icebergs and dinosaurs to hummingbirds, crystals and rock collecting, including ''When Birds Change Their Feathers'' (1980) and ''How Do Birds Find Their Way,'' reprinted this year.
        She was a past chairman of the Citizens Committee for Children of New York City, an organization of professional and lay experts active in child welfare work.
        Dr. Gans is survived by three sisters, Mary Ann Farraro and Elizabeth Nentl of St. Cloud, Minn., and Blanche Frick of Pittsfield, Mass.
