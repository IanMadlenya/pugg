        Alice Kornegay, a powerful community advocate in East Harlem for the better part of 40 years, died on Tuesday at North General Hospital.  She was 65.
        According to Barbara Brown, an adopted daughter, Mrs. Kornegay had a heart attack while attending a board meeting of an addicts rehabilitation organization, one of the many community groups to which she lent her efforts.
        A member of Community Board 11 and Community School Board 5, a former member of the 25th Precinct Community Council and a former treasurer of the Harlem Commonwealth Council, a community betterment organization, Mrs. Kornegay was perhaps best known as the founder and president of the Community Association of  the East Harlem Triangle. Through this not-for-profit organization, Mrs. Kornegay secured the financing for construction of low-income housing.
        "In East Harlem, she was probably the strongest advocate for the African-American community," said Eddie Baca, the chairman of Community Board 11.
        Mrs. Kornegay was also a co-sponsor with the Abyssinian Baptist Church in the effort to bring a Pathmark superstore to the area.
        Mrs. Kornegay was Alice Grace Wragg when she came from Georgetown, S.C., her  birthplace, to live with cousins in East Harlem at the age of 10 after her parents died. She studied social work at Baruch College and graduated from the New School for Social Research.
        Bette Washington, a longtime friend and associate, said that Mrs. Kornegay became active in local issues at once. "She saw a need in her community," Ms. Washington said.
        Mrs. Kornegay's husband of 47 years, Richard, died last week. In addition to  Ms. Brown, a resident of the Bronx, she is survived by an adopted son, Anthony Wragg, and by three brothers, James Wragg of Manhattan, Wesley Wragg of Georgetown, S.C., and Sam Wragg of Philadelphia.
