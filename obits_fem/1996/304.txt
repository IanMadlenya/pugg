        Olga Havel, a human rights campaigner and wife of President Vaclav Havel, died on Saturday. She was 62.
        Mrs. Havel died at her home here after suffering from cancer, the President's office said.
        She was born in a Prague to a working-class family and met her husband, the  oldest son of a Prague industrialist impoverished by Communist nationalization in 1948, when he was a theater stage hand in the 1950's. They married in 1964.
        Mrs. Havel was a signer of the Charter 77 human rights manifesto and worked in the dissident network led by her husband.
        Charter 77, signed by intellectuals and others in January 1977, started a human rights offensive against Soviet control in what was then Czechoslovakia. Ultimately, it led to the formation of Civic Forum, a democratic movement that toppled Communist rule in 1989 and catapulted Mr. Havel, a dissident playwright, into the presidency in late 1989. Mrs. Havel later formed a committee known for  its charity work.
        She is survived by her husband.
