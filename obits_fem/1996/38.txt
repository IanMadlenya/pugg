        Susie Marshall Sharp, the first woman to be popularly elected to the post of  chief justice of a state supreme court in the United States, died on Friday at her home. She was 88.
        Miss Sharp was appointed a North Carolina Superior Court judge in 1949, and she was appointed to the state's high court in 1962. Former Gov. Terry Sanford,  the Democrat who appointed her, recalled the moment on Friday.
        There wasn't any question about her qualifications," Mr. Sanford said. "The selection of Susie Sharp to be a member of the Supreme Court was the most widely approved appointment that I ever made."
        Miss Sharp was elected Chief Justice in November 1974, replacing William H. Bobbitt, her longtime colleague on the bench. She stayed until her mandatory retirement at age 72 in 1979.
        Miss Sharp was not a feminist and lobbied against the Equal Rights Amendment. But many feminists championed her anyway, hoping that she would be appointed to  the United States Supreme Court or the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Several prominent politicians, including Senators Sam Ervin and  Jesse Helms, tried without success to get Presidents to nominate her to the nation's highest court.
        Miss Sharp is survived by two brothers, Dr. James C. Sharp and Thomas A. Sharp, and two sisters, Louise W. Sharp and Annie Hill Klenner.
