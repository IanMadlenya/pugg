        Pamela R. Berdan, a landscape designer responsible for many gardens in the New York area, died on May 15 at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 91.
        The cause was cancer, said a friend, Deborah Peterson.
        Ms. Berdan designed her best-known gardens in Greenwich Village, among them  the Sheridan Square garden, a small triangle that she transformed from a parking area, and the garden of St. John's in the Village Episcopal Church, at Waverly Place and West 11th Street.
        The St. John's garden, under a canopy of ailanthus trees and in the shadow cast by the church, was planned so that some foliage or blossoms would be visible all year. It was developed by Ms. Berdan in 1974 and she tended it for years. A photograph of the garden is featured on the cover of "The City Gardener's Handbook: From Balcony to Backyard" by Linda Yang (Random House, 1990).
        In 1982, when Ms. Berdan suffered two broken legs when struck by a car. she sent instructions for planting from her hospital bed.
        Ms. Berdan was born in Toledo, Ohio, and attended Vassar College and the Beaux Arts Academy at Fontainbleau, France. She was associated as an interior designer with the Arden Studio in Manhattan before turning to horticulture.
        She is survived by a sister, Jean Berdan of Washington.
