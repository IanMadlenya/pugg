        Aliki Vouyouklaki, a film actress who was the darling of towns and villages throughout Greece and who never seemed to age over a career that spanned more than four decades, died of cancer on Tuesday at the Athens Medical Center. She was 63.
        Among the most popular of her 41 movies were "Aliki in the Navy," in which she played an admiral's daughter, and "Spanking From Heaven," in which she played a rebellious high school student.
        In the 1960's, she married her leading man, Dimitris Papamichail. They divorced after three years.
        She is survived by a son, Yannis Papamichail; her mother and two brothers.
