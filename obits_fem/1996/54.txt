        Lynn O'Donnell, the producer of the documentary film "Crumb," died in San Francisco on April 17. She was 43. The cause was ovarian cancer, said her husband, Lawrence Wilkinson.
        Ms. O'Donnell produced and directed several films, but her greatest critical  success came with "Crumb," a dark portrait of the underground cartoonist Robert  Crumb and his family. Directed by Terry Zwigoff, it won the top prize for documentaries at the 1995 Sundance Film Festival.
        Ms. O'Donnell was born in Berkeley, Calif. After earning a degree in film making from San Francisco State University, she worked as an editor in Vienna on the television mini-series "Holocaust" and on German feature films. From 1977 to 1980 she worked at KQED, the San Francisco public television station, where she  became head of production.
        After leaving KQED, she produced and directed "Voices of the Tango," a documentary about the Argentine tango singer Carlos Gardel, and produced "Czeslaw Milosz: The Poet Remembers," which was directed by Jan Nemec. She also  produced "Living on Tokyo Time," the first feature by the director Steven Okazaki.
        In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Nora; her parents, Virginia and Ashton O'Donnell, of Woodside, Calif., and three sisters, Sherry Burns, of Cupertino, Calif.; Joan, of Santa Fe, N.M., and Jennifer Conner, of San Rafael, Calif.
        Correction:  April 30, 1996, Tuesday
        An obituary yesterday about the producer of the documentary film "Crumb" misspelled her surname in some references. She was Lynn O'Donnell, not O'Connell
