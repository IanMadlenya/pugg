        Gioia Marconi Braga, the founder and chairwoman of the privately supported Marconi International Fellowship Council, who promoted scientific and cultural relations between Italy and the United States, died on Monday at Englewood Hospital. She was 80 and lived in Alpine, N.J.
        Mrs. Braga was born in London, a daughter of the Marchese Guglielmo Marconi,  the Italian developer of wireless telegraphy and 1909 Nobelist in physics. She was educated in Italy and later worked in radio and television, in Rome for the  state-run RAI, and in New York for NBC.
        The fellowship, which she founded in 1974, annually commissions creative work by scientists and scholars who have shown a commitment to humanistic goals  in science and technology.
        For many years, she also served as a director of the Institute of International Education and the Spoleto Festival of Two Worlds. She was on the boards of Polytechnic University of Brooklyn and the Center for Italian Studies  at Columbia University.
        She is survived by a son, Michael, of Tampa, Fla.; a daughter, Allegra, of Manhattan; a sister, Degna Paresce of Rome, and two grandchildren. Her husband of 31 years, George Atkinson Braga, died in 1985.
