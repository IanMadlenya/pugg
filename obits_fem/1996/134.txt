        Virginia Christine, a character actress who portrayed the motherly Mrs. Olson in Folger's coffee television commercials for 21 years, died on Wednesday at her home in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles. She was 76.
        The cause was heart complications, her family said.
        Ms. Christine, who began her career in films, was best known as Mrs. Olson,  a smiling, likable Swedish woman who was always ready to bring happiness to young married couples by brewing them a cup of "mountain-grown" Folger's.
        After making her motion picture debut with Errol Flynn in the 1943 movie "Edge of Darkness," she performed in more than 400 films and television productions.
        Her film credits include "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner," "Cyrano de Bergerac," "High Noon," "Judgment at Nuremberg" and "Invasion of the Body Snatchers." On television, she appeared in "Gunsmoke," "Bonanza" and "Twilight Zone."
        The actress, whose name was originally Virginia Kraft, was born in Stanton, Iowa, in 1920. The town later converted its water tower to resemble a coffee pot in honor of its most famous citizen. In 1940, she married Fritz Feld, an actor,  who died in 1993.
        She is survived by two sons, Steven and Danny Feld of Los Angeles, and two grandchildren.
