        Helen Keane, a manager and producer who was one of the few women on the business side of jazz, died at Cabrini Hospice in New York on Monday. She was 73 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was breast cancer, her son Timothy Wood said.
        Ms. Keane is best known for her business relationship with the pianist Bill  Evans, whom she represented from 1963 until his death in 1980. Their partnership helped make him one of jazz's biggest draws. She produced his recordings for many years and just recently finished "But Beautiful," an album taken from several of Mr. Evans's live concerts and featuring the saxophonist Stan Getz.
        She also worked with the guitarist Kenny Burrell, the trumpeter Art Farmer and the saxophonist Paquito D'Rivera during the 1970's and 80's. She was involved in the careers of the pianists JoAnne Brackeen and Keith McDonald, along with the all-women group Alive.
        Ms. Keane had an interest in promoting female singers, and during the last several decades she worked with Sylvia Sims and Morgana King.  She also produced records for Chris Connor and Carole Sloane.
        Ms. Keane began her career in the 1950's as an artists-and-repertory scout for MCA and CBS. She played an important role in the early careers of several singers and entertainers, among them Harry Belafonte, Carol Burnett and Don Knotts.
        In addition to Mr. Wood of San Francisco, she is survived by another son, Christopher Rudolf of Portland, Ore.
