        Deborah Henry, a Broadway dancer who appeared in "A Chorus Line" and in a number of touring musicals, died on Feb. 5 at her family's home in Memphis. She  was 44 and lived in Union City, N.J.
        The cause was ovarian cancer, said Donna Drake, a friend.
        Ms. Henry danced with the Royal Winnipeg Ballet before becoming a musical theater performer. She traveled throughout the country with the New York and touring companies of numerous musicals, including "Promises, Promises" and "Cats," but she was best known for her work in "A Chorus Line," in which she performed so often that she was sent out to prepare new touring companies of the show.
        "Chorus Line" legends clung to Ms. Henry, including one about her persistence in completing the high-powered dance number "Music and the Mirror" while bats flew around her head in one Midwestern theater.
        She is survived by her father, Jack; her stepmother, Christine; two brothers, Michael and Jack; a sister, Darlene, and a stepsister, Ashley, all of Memphis.
