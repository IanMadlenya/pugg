        Lynda Gudde, a modern dancer and choreographer, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 54.
        The cause has not been determined, said Ronny Cohen, a friend.
        Born in San Angelo, Tex., Ms. Gudde was raised in rural Missouri and came to New York City in the late 1960's to continue her dance training. She studied dance at New York University and at the American Dance Festival in New London, Conn.
        Ms. Gudde danced with Anna Sokolow and in 1968 formed a company in New York City called Gudde Dancers that was drawn from her dance students at the Julia Richmond High School in Manhattan. Many of her dances were inspired by paintings by artists, including Egon Schiele, Paul Delvaux and Aubrey Beardsley.
        In a review of a concert by Ms. Gudde and her dancers in 1971, Anna Kisselgoff wrote in The New York Times that the choreographer had ''a strong theatrical sense'' and was an expressionist at heart. ''This may put her outside the fold,'' Ms. Kisselgoff continued. ''But she is a creator of unusual and colorful imagery.''
        Ms. Gudde devoted herself to painting after her company disbanded in 1980. Her work was shown at the Galerie St. Etienne in Manhattan and in group shows during the 1980's.
        She is survived by a sister, Janice, of Orange County, Calif.
