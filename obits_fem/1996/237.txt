        Aida Alvarez, a dancer, choreographer and teacher of Spanish dance, died on Oct. 26 at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 78 and lived in Manhattan.
        She died after a short illness, said Jen Nelson, a friend.
        Born in Mechanicsville, N.Y., Ms. Alvarez studied Spanish dancing during visits to northern Spain, where her family originated, and also trained at the Ballet Arts studio in New York City with teachers who included Angel Cansino and Yeichi Nimura.
        In 1947, Ms. Alvarez danced the lead ballerina role in ''Carmen'' at the Metropolitan Opera and performed with the opera ballet for three years.
        She performed and choreographed on television in the early 1950's in such series as ''NBC Opera'' and ''Voice of Firestone.''
        She toured in nightclub acts and choreographed large-scale pageants for the Centennial Celebration in Flint, Mich., and the St. Louis Mid-American Jubilee.
        Ms. Alvarez also staged and choreographed musicals and operettas at the Finger Lakes Lyric Circus. She worked as a production stage manager and assistant director for the Institute for Advanced Study of Theater Arts in New York City.
        After retiring from dance, she headed the subscription department of the Joffrey Ballet.
        She is survived by a son, Michael Rubin of Boston.
