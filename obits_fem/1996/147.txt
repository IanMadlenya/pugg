        Miss Cousins was born in Munday, Tex., and earned a bachelor's degree in English at the University of Texas at Austin in 1926. After working as an editor at The Southern Pharmaceutical Journal, in Dallas, a trade magazine published by her father, she moved in 1937 to New York City. She was an editor at Pictorial Review, for which she wrote short stories and a column called ''Baghdad on the Subway.'' After the review folded, she wrote copy for the promotions department of Hearst magazines before serving as managing editor of Good Housekeeping and McCall's.
        In 1961, Miss Cousins became a senior editor at Doubleday, where the books she handled included the best-selling novel ''Hurry Sundown.'' After a brief stint as a special editor at Holt, Rinehart & Winston in 1970, she returned to magazines as the fiction and book editor for The Ladies' Home Journal.
        Miss Cousins wrote hundreds of short stories for popular magazines, one of which, ''The Life of Lucy Gallant,'' was made into the 1955 film ''Lucy Gallant,'' starring Jane Wyman. She also wrote several novels and biographies for children, including ''Uncle Edgar and the Reluctant Saint'' (1948), ''Ben Franklin of Old Philadelphia'' (1952), ''We Were There at the Battle of the Alamo'' (1958) and ''Thomas Alva Edison'' (1965).
