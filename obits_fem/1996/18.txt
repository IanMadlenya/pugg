        Bernice Lotwin Bernstein, a former New York regional director of the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare, died on Wednesday at the Group Health Hospital in Seattle. She was 87 and had moved to Seattle from the Upper East Side of Manhattan eight months ago.
        She was appointed director of Region 2, which covered New York and New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, in 1966. She was responsible for evaluating H.E.W. programs in her jurisdiction of 30 million people.
        She also supervised the operations of the Health Services and Mental Health  Administration, the Social Security Administration, the Office of Education, the Social and Rehabilitation Service, the Office of Child Development and the Food  and Drug Administration.
        Mrs. Bernstein retired as director in 1977 and worked as a special assistant  to Secretary Joseph A. Califano Jr. for more than a year longer.
        From then until her death, she served as a director of the Non-Governmental Committee on Aging at the United Nations.
        She was a past president of the Federal Business Association in New York and  chairman of the Federal Regional Council. She was active in the National Council of Jewish Women as a member of the national board and executive committee and national treasurer.
        Born in Menomonie, Wis., she was a philosophy graduate of the University of Wisconsin, from which she received a doctorate in 1932 from the Law School. She  took up public service the next year as an attorney for the National Recovery Administration.
        Mrs. Bernstein is survived by three daughters, Elinor B. Balka of Forest Hills, Queens, Kate L. Bernstein of Manhattan, and Anne L. Bernstein of Seattle; a sister, Alice Lotwin of Peoria, Ill., and three grandchildren. Her husband of  52 years, Bernard, died in 1990.
