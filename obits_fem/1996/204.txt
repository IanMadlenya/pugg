        Laura Epstein, an educator in social work who was retired from the University of Chicago faculty, died on Sept. 18 at her home in Chicago. She was 82.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, said her brother, Robert.
        Professor Epstein retired in 1985 after 18 years as an instructor and professor in the university's School of Social Service Administration. Her earlier work included serving as director of social work education and as casework supervisor in agencies in Chicago.
        Much of her research involved the development of a short-term form of social work practice called the Task Centered Model. Later she studied aspects of the history of clinical social work in the 20th century.
        Her writings include ''Helping People: the Task Centered Approach'' (Macmillan, 1992).
        Born in Chicago, she received a bachelor's degree in psychology in 1934 from the University of Chicago and a master's degree in 1936 from its School of Social Service Administration.
        She is survived by her brother, of Skokie, Ill.
