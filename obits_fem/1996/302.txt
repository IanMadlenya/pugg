        Pam Conrad, the author of "Prairie Songs," "Stonewords: A Ghost Story" and other works for children and young adults, died on Monday at her home in Rockville Center, L.I. She was 48.
        The cause was breast cancer, said a spokeswoman at the Maria Carvainis literary agency.
        Ms. Conrad was born in New York City. She graduated from the New School for  Social Research in 1984.
        After writing "I Don't Live Here!" (1983), she won critical praise for "Prairie Songs" (1985), about a pioneer woman who goes mad after moving from New York to the plains of Nebraska.
        Ms. Conrad explored sometimes disturbing themes for young readers in her fiction. Her novel "Our House: Stories of Levittown," was a finalist for the 1995 Newbery Medal. She wrote one novel for adults, "Pumpkin Moon" (1994).
        She is survived by two daughters, Sarah, of Rockville Center, and Johanna, of Melbourne, Fla.; her parents, Robert and Doris Stampf of Lancaster, Pa.; two brothers, David, of Shoreham, L.I., and Jonathan, of North Valley Stream, L.I.,  and a sister, Melissa, of Ronkonkoma, L.I.
