        Elizabeth Greig, one of the country's most accomplished women at tying fly-fishing lures who was known for her adeptness and her unusual technique, died last Saturday at Highlands Lake Center-Genesis Eldercare in Lakeland, Fla. She was 93.
        An expert known for tying flies with her hands instead of with a conventional vise, Mrs. Greig was a innovator in fly-fishing at a time when mostly men participated in the sport. In the late 1930's, Mrs. Greig was a founder of Angler's Roost, a popular fly-fishing shop situated in the Chrysler Building in New York City.
        Her skills were pervasive, from knowing where to wade into the fly-fishing streams of the Catskills, to the important task of choosing the feathers and other materials that made the difference between a quality or inferior fly. Scotty, as she was called, encouraged the fish tales that floated in and out of the conversations at her shop in New York. ''There were more fish caught in my shop than on most streams,'' she was once quoted as having said.
        Mrs. Greig was born in Peebles, Scotland, on Sept. 10, 1902. Her father, a stone mason, taught her how to fly-fish on the shores of the River Tweed by day, and how to tie flies at the kitchen table by night.
        The family eventually moved to Edinburgh, where Mrs. Greig, then 14 years old, spent four years as an apprentice at a fly-dressing factory. After marrying Robert Greig of Scotland in the early 1930's, she and her husband immigrated to Canada, where they lived for several years before moving to New York City. In the mid-1950's, they moved on to Lakeland, Fla., where Mrs. Greig continued to specialize in making fishing lures. Her husband died in 1968.
        Mrs. Greig is survived by three sisters, Annie, Nan and Jean, who live in Scotland.
