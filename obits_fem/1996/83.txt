        Constance Sullivan Carden, who helped plan Alice Tully Hall and was on the boards of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, died on Thursday at her Manhattan home. She was 86.
        Mrs. Carden was born in Manhattan, a daughter of Walter S. Sullivan, a New York Times advertising manager. She graduated from the Brearley School in Manhattan and from Bryn Mawr College.
        She studied lieder singing in the 1930's and worked for the Office of Strategic Services, translating captured Nazi documents, in Washington during World War II. She was a singer during, and for some years after, the war.
        Mrs. Carden was on the Philharmonic board from 1958 to 1978 and was chairwoman of its education committee, which developed programs to bring classical music into New York City public schools.
        She was on the planning committee for Alice Tully Hall for several years before the hall opened, in Lincoln Center, in 1969. In that capacity, she mainly helped Alice Tully, the philanthropist for whom the building is named, raise funds for its construction. Mrs. Carden was on the board of the Chamber Music Society from 1969 to 1991.
        She is survived by her husband, Dr. George A. Carden; three sons, Dr. George  Alexander Carden of Palm Beach, Fla., William of Manhattan and Timothy of Montclair, N.J.; a daughter, Constance of Manhattan; five grandchildren, and a sister, Jeanet Curtis of New Haven. Her brother, Walter Sullivan, a former science editor of The Times, died in March.
