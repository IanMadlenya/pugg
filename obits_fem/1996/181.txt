        The actress and film director Christine Pascal, who made her movie acting debut at 21 and directed her first film at 25, has died at the age of 42, her husband's production agency said yesterday in Paris.
        The agency, Armedia, founded by Ms. Pascal's husband, Richard Boner, did not give the cause of her death, which it said occurred late on Friday or early Saturday. The newspaper Le Monde said it was suicide.
        Ms. Pascal began her film career in 1973 with a role in ''The Clockmaker,'' a well-received movie directed by Bertrand Tavernier and starring Philippe Noiret. Mr. Tavernier also directed her in four other movies, including ''Round Midnight'' (1985), a homage to bebop set in 50's Paris,  and ''Spoiled Children'' (1977), about a blocked writer-director who becomes involved with a younger woman.
        She had roles in ''Black Thursday'' (1975), a film by Michel Mitrani about the roundup of Jews in Paris during the German occupation, and ''The Grand Highway'' (1987), the story of a 9-year-old boy who spends three weeks in a rural village.
        In 1992 she won the Louis Delluc Prize for directing ''Le Petit Prince a Dit'' (''The Little Prince Said''). The most recent film she directed was ''Adultere: Mode d'Emploi'' (''Adultery: A User's Guide''),  which came out last year and was part of the Hamptons Film Festival.
        ''I'm completely in shock, I can't believe it,'' Mr. Tavernier told the radio station RTL. ''She was someone who doubted herself, who experienced depression, whom you had to encourage constantly because she was afraid,'' he added. ''She was extraordinarily sensitive, and she showed it in the films she made as a director and as an actress.''
