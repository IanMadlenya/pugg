        Arlene Wanderman, an editor and public relations executive who was the American spokeswoman for the International Olive Oil Council, died on Monday at Beth Israel North Hospital. She was 60 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause has not been determined, said Linda Russo, an associate.
        In 1990, Ms. Wanderman founded Foodcom, a public relations company in Manhattan that specializes in food, wine and cooking equipment. The company's major account is the International Olive Oil Council, a nonprofit educational and promotional agency supported by the governments of many Mediterranean countries, which also set standards for olive oil.
        Her career in food started at the Macfadden Group as women's service editor for such magazines as True Story, True Confessions and Photoplay. She then became the food and equipment editor of Ladies' Home Journal before embarking on a career in advertising and public relations.
        Ms. Wanderman, a native of Brooklyn, graduated from Cornell University and had a degree in metabolic dietetics from New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.
        Her marriages to Bob Reiter of Boca Raton, Fla., and Philip L. Wanderman of White Plains, both ended in divorce.
        She is survived by her son, James K. Reiter of Hollywood, Fla.; her mother, Edith Rosenwasser of Boca Raton, Fla., and her brother, Stan Rosenwasser of Rehobeth Beach, Del.
