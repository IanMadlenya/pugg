        Lucille Darvin Maurer, a Maryland legislator whose expertise in public finance led her to the post of State Treasurer, died on Monday at her home in Silver Spring. She was 73.
        The cause was a brain tumor, her family said.
        Mrs. Maurer, a Democrat, represented Montgomery County for 18 years in the House of Delegates, the lower house of the General Assembly, Maryland's legislature.
        The General Assembly elected her Treasurer in 1987. Stricken by her fatal illness, she resigned in January.
        Mrs. Maurer, a native of New York City, graduated in economics from the University of North Carolina and earned a master's degree in general studies at  Yale.
        She is survived by her husband of 51 years, Ely Maurer; three sons, Stephen B., of Swarthmore, Pa., Russell A., of Pepper Pike, Ohio, and Edward N., of Lido Beach, L.I.; a brother, Eugene Darvin of Pearl River, N.Y., and seven grandchildren.
