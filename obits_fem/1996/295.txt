        Lois Shapiro, a publishing executive who helped handle best sellers like "The World According to Garp" by John Irving, "Faces at the Bottom of the Well" by Derrick Bell and "Passages" by Gail Sheehy, died on Wednesday at New York Hospital. She was 57 and lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
        The cause was multiple myeloma, a form of bone marrow cancer, her family said.
        She was director of publicity and advertising at E. P. Dutton from 1970 to 1982. She then joined Basic Books, a subsidiary of HarperCollins, as associate publisher, senior vice president and director of publicity and rights. She retired last September but remained a consultant.
        She was born in Waterbury, Conn., and graduated from the University of Connecticut in 1960.
        Ms. Shapiro is survived by her husband, Joel Belsky; a stepson, Peter Belsky  of Manhattan, and three brothers, Martin, of Norwich, Conn., Robert, of Miami, and Norman, o Kingston, R.I.
