        Barbara Skelton, a writer whose best subject was her own life of passionate abandon, died on Saturday in Worcestershire in western England from a brain tumor, The Times of London reported on Monday. She was 79.
        Her two volumes of memoirs -- "Tears Before Bedtime" (1987) and "Weep No More" (1989) -- were savored for their malicious descriptions of her three husbands and many lovers, including King Farouk of Egypt and a police officer who came to investigate a burglary at her home.
        She was married three times: to the literary critic Cyril Connolly from 1950 to 1956; to the publisher George Weidenfeld from 1956 to 1961, and briefly to Derek Jackson, a newspaper heir, in 1966.
        She wrote two novels, "A Young Girl's Touch" (1956) and "A Love Match" (1969), though the latter was withdrawn because of threats of legal action by a  former friend. Her two memoirs became the basis for a 1995 film.
