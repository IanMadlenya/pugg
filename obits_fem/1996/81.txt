        Arona Lipman McHugh, the author of four novels, two of them set in her native Boston, died on Wednesday at St. Vincent's Medical Center in Staten Island. She  was 71 and lived in the West Brighton section.
        The cause was cardiac arrest, her family said.
        Mrs. McHugh's first novel, written at the family's summer home in Sag Harbor, L.I., was "A Banner With a Strange Device" (1964). It prompted the critic Haskel Frankel to welcome her in The New York Times Book Review with an accolade, "The lady is a born storyteller." Unusual for a first effort, it became a best seller and a Literary Guild selection.
        It was the tale of a group of former G.I.'s and their women who were trying to patch their lives together again in the late 1940's in Boston. A sequel, "The Seacoast of Bohemia" (1965), followed some of the same characters and their entanglements.
        Mrs. McHugh then turned out a historical novel in 1969, "The Luck of the Van  Meers," which traced several generations of a Dutch-Jewish family. Her final novel, also historical, was "The Calling of the Mercenaries" (1977), which focused on occupied Germany after World War II.
        Mrs. McHugh graduated in 1950 with one of the first groups to finish the writer's program at the University of Iowa. She earned a master's degree in library science at Columbia University the next year.
        In World War II she served in the Women's Army Corps in the United States and in occupied Germany. Before becoming a published novelist, she worked as a children's librarian at the New York Public Library.
        Her husband, Warren J. McHugh, a folk artist who kept an art gallery in Sag Harbor for many years, died in 1986. She is survived by two sons, Michael W., of Staten Island and Jonathan A., of Los Angeles, and a granddaughter.
