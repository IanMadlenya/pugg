        Andrea Ungar Wilson, a former investment analyst, school administrator and labor arbitrator, died on August 11 at her summer home in Wainscott, N.Y. She was 73 and a resident of Manhattan.
        The cause was heart failure, her family said.
        A native of Vienna, she graduated from Mount Holyoke in 1943, received a Master of Business Administration degree from New York University in 1946 and a doctorate in education in 1971.
        Starting in 1944, she worked for 17 years at a number of investment consulting firms in New York. She then became an assistant to a member of the Board of Education and became involved with the decentralization plan that instituted the system of neighborhood school boards in the 1960's.
        She was later appointed an assistant dean and associate professor of educational administration at New York University. At her death she worked as a labor arbitrator for the New York State Mediation Board.
        Mrs. Wilson's husband, Fred W., died in 1994. She is survived by a son, David, of Wayne, N.J.; a daughter, Pamela, of Chicago; a sister, Marlene Bagdikian of Berkeley, Calif., and two grandchildren.
