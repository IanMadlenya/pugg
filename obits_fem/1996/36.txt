        Marsha Wenk, legal director of the New Jersey chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, which prevailed in cases involving school prayer and a law requiring community notification about the presence of paroled sex offenders, died at New York University Medical Center on March 23.  She was 37 and lived in Bloomfield.
        The cause was cancer, Edward Martone, the chapter's executive director, said.
        Ms. Wenk joined the chapter as staff lawyer in 1992 and became legal director the next year. During her tenure, the A.C.L.U. convinced Federal judges that it was unconstitutional to notify neighbors about a released sex offender's whereabouts.
        In addition, the full United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is considering whether prayers will be permitted at graduation ceremonies for two Camden County high schools.
        Ms. Wenk graduated from Rutgers University in 1981 and obtained a law degree  in 1987.
        She is survived by her parents, Gene and Betty Wenk of Rutherford, N.J., and  two sisters, Karen Wenk-Salamore of Stockton, N.J., and Laura Wenk of Sunderland, Mass.
