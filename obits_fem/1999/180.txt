        Emily Solis Nathan, a journalist who later became a public relations executive specializing in art and museum projects in New York, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 92.
        Miss Nathan was born in Manhattan. She graduated from Adelphi University and received a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University in 1929. She wrote for The Bronx Home News, The New York Sun, The Sun-World Telegram and WOR radio.
        Just before World War II she began a career in public relations and eventually started a firm with Helen Erskine. Her clients included the Archives of American Art, the National Portrait Gallery and the New-York Historical Society. During the war she helped organize art exhibitions to benefit the American Friends of France and the Free French. Her first at the Metropolitan Museum of Art was an exhibition of British and American cartoons, a wartime benefit for the English Speaking Union. It was the second exhibition of cartoons at the Metropolitan.
        Miss Nathan is survived by two nieces and two nephews.
