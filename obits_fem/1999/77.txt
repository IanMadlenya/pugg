        Ruth Moulton Gilbert, a practicing psychoanalyst in Manhattan for over 40 years, died on April 30 at her home in Clinton Corners, N.Y. She was 83.
        The cause was complications from cancer, her family said.
        Dr. Moulton, who was known professionally by her maiden name, was a supervising and training analyst and fellow emeritus at the William Alanson White Institute of Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis and Psychology. She served as the institute's director of training from 1960 to 1970. She also was an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University and associate attending psychiatrist at the New York State Psychiatric Institute from the 1950's until 1980.
        She took a professional interest in the way theories of female sexuality had changed since the days of Freud. She published many papers on related topics, including feminism, frigidity, the changing family structure and the roles of men and women.
        Ruth Moulton was born in Columbia, Mo., and graduated from the University of Chicago in 1936 and from its medical school three years later. She trained in psychiatry under Drs. Erich Fromm, Harry Stack Sullivan and Frieda Fromm-Reichmann and graduated from the New York Branch of the Washington School of Psychiatry in 1946.
        Dr. Moulton's husband, Dr. Louis J. Gilbert, died in 1989. She is survived by their daughter, Karen Gilbert of Brentwood, Calif.; two sons from an earlier marriage, Dr. David Flory of Manhattan and Dr. Christopher Flory of Williamsburg, Mass., and four grandchildren.
