        Barbara Pfeffer, a photojournalist whose pictures appeared in Life, People, Town and Country and other magazines, died March 3 in her Manhattan home. She was 65.
        The cause was lung cancer, said her sister, Doris Pfeffer of Manhattan.
        Ms. Pfeffer, a New York City native, graduated from the Juilliard School of Music as a pianist before turning to photojournalism. She also made documentary films on Jewish themes. Her documentary ''Art and Remembrance, the Legacy of Felix Nussbaum,'' about the German-Jewish painter who hid in Belgium during World War II but was caught by the Nazis and killed at Auschwitz, received a CINE award.
        ''Jewish Soul, American Beat,'' her documentary about young American Jews, will be broadcast this spring on public television. In June, the Museum of Jewish Heritage will show a retrospective of her photographs.
        Besides her sister, she is survived by two former husbands, Jerry Fishman and Carroll Calkins.
