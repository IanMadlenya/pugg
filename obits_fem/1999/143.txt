        Nancy Guild, a film actress who starred opposite some of the leading men of the 1940's and early 50's, died on Monday at her home in East Hampton, Long Island, after a long battle with emphysema. She was 73.
        Ms. Guild, whose full name was Nancy Guild Martin, was ''discovered'' in old Hollywood style when she appeared in a 1945 Life magazine picture layout about campus fashions while a student at the University of Arizona. With her bone structure and insouciance, she captured the attention of five movie studios, which offered her screen tests.
        She was signed to a seven-year contract by 20th Century-Fox, during which she made her film debut as a nightclub singer in Joseph L. Mankiewicz's ''Somewhere in the Night'' (1946), starring John Hodiak. Movie ads urged viewers to ''meet that Guild girl; she rhymes with wild.''
        She went on to star with George Montgomery in ''The Brasher Doubloon'' (1947), based on the Raymond Chandler thriller ''The High Window,'' and with Orson Welles in ''Black Magic'' (1949). She retired from acting in the 50's and later wrote for Architectural Digest.
        Ms. Guild married the actor Charles Russell, with whom she had a daughter, Elizabeth. They divorced in 1950 and she married Ernest H. Martin, who produced Broadway hits like ''Guys and Dolls.'' Divorced from Mr. Martin in 1975, she married John Bryson, a photojournalist, in 1978. They divorced in 1995.
        She is survived by three daughters, Elizabeth Martin of Boulder, Colo., and Cecilia Martin Ford and Polly Martin of New York, and three granddaughters.
