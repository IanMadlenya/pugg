        State Senator Wynona M. Lipman, who in 1971 became the first African-American woman to be elected to the New Jersey Senate, died Sunday at her home in Newark. She was 67.
        The cause was cancer, her office said.
        Senator Lipman, a Democrat who represented Newark, was the longest-serving member of the State Senate. For 27 years she championed the causes of women, minority groups, children and small businesses. One bill she sponsored that became law increased penalties for adults who patronize under-age prostitutes. Another broadened the statutes on domestic violence to protect more victims and increase services to the children of troubled families.
        She sat on the Governor's Council on AIDS, the Task Force on Child Abuse and Neglect and the New Jersey Court Team on Domestic Violence.
        A native of Georgia, she was educated at Talladega College, Tulane University and Columbia University, where she received a doctorate in philosophy on a Rockefeller Grant. She studied at the Sorbonne as a Fulbright scholar and taught high school. While serving in the Senate, she was also an associate professor at Essex County College.
        For years she was not only the sole black but also the lone woman in a house she called a ''men's club'' some years ago. She held ranking positions on important committees, including those dealing with human services, the budget and appropriations.
        Senator Lipman's survivors include her daughter, Karyne Anne Lipman of Atlanta, and a sister, Eloise Ransome of Virginia.
