        Ginette Lesley Harrison, an outstanding alpinist, was lost in an avalanche on Sunday on one of the most treacherous Himalayan mountains.  She was 41.
        A British-born physician who specialized in high-altitude medicine, Dr. Harrison was part of an 11-member international expedition scaling Dhaulagiri in central Nepal, at 26,795 feet the world's seventh highest mountain. She was lost on her final ascent after two teammates had reached the summit; a sherpa on another expedition was killed in the same avalanche.
        Her death was reported at Dhaulagiri base camp by her husband, Gary Scott Pfisterer, the American leader of the team.
        The couple met in 1993 on Mount Everest, when they walked to the summit hand in hand. They recently moved to his hometown in Massachusetts, Monson.
        Dr. Harrison earned her medical degree at Bristol University and trained in high-altitude and wilderness medicine at the University of Colorado. Besides her husband, her survivors include her parents, Brenda and Douglas Harrison, of Saltash, Cornwall.
