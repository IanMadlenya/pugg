        Eleanore B. Saidenberg, the owner of an art gallery that for years was Picasso's primary representative in the United States, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 88.
        Born Eleanore Block in Chicago in 1911, Mrs. Saidenberg graduated from Finch College in New York and started a career as a modern dancer.
        She performed at the Goodman Theater in Chicago from 1932 to 1936. In 1934 she married Daniel Saidenberg, then first cellist of the Chicago Symphony and later also a conductor.
        Mrs. Saidenberg danced professionally until she and her husband moved to New York in 1942. In 1950 she opened the Saidenberg Gallery at 10 East 77th Street.
        She soon met Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, the influential art dealer in Paris, who asked her to represent Picasso. That association lasted from 1955 until Picasso's death in 1973.
        Her gallery, which moved to Madison Avenue and 79th Street in 1963 and a half-block south on Madison in 1978, also dealt in the works of Klee, Braque, Leger, Kandinsky and other 20th-century masters.
        Mrs. Saidenberg was a founder of the Art Dealers Association of America and helped organize several multigallery exhibitions in New York, including ''Picasso, An American Tribute'' in 1962 and ''Seven Decades: Crosscurrents in Modern Art'' in 1966, to raise money for the Public Education Association.
        Over the years, Mrs. Saidenberg donated works of 20th-century art to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Israel Museum and other institutions.
        Her husband died in 1997. She is survived by two sons, Lawrence and Robert, both of Manhattan; nine grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
        Mrs. Saidenberg continued to operate the Saidenberg Gallery until June, when she closed it.
