        Ellen B. Hirschland, an art collector, teacher and a great-niece of the Baltimore collectors Claribel and Etta Cone, died on Sept. 3 while traveling near St. Moritz, Switzerland. She was 80 and lived in Great Neck, N.Y.
        The cause was pneumonia, said her son Edward.
        Mrs. Hirschland was born in Baltimore, the daughter of Sidney Berney, a vice president at Isaac Hamburger, a clothing store in Baltimore, and Dorothy Long Berney, a niece of Etta and Claribel Cone, who amassed a world-class collection of 19th and 20th century art, including 42 Matisse oil paintings, which they bequeathed to the Baltimore Museum of Art in 1949.
        When she was 17, Mrs. Hirschland traveled with Etta Cone to Paris, where she met Matisse, who became one of her lifelong friends. She also came to know other modern masters, including Chagall, Albers, Miro and Louise Nevelson.
        In 1940, the year she graduated from Wheaton College, she married Paul M. Hirschland, who became a Manhattan investment banker. Mr. Hirschland died in 1988. During their marriage, the couple collected modern art and put together a group of works by artists ranging from Cezanne to Frank Stella. Mrs. Hirschland was also a trustee of the Baltimore Museum of Art.
        For 35 years, Mrs. Hirschland taught art history in the adult education program in the Great Neck public schools. She also lectured widely on the Cone sisters and, with her daughter, Nancy H. Ramage, recently completed a biography about them, which is to be published by Harry N. Abrams next year.
        In addition to her son Edward, of Chicago, and daughter, Nancy, of Ithaca, N.Y., she is survived by another son, Roger, of Washington.
