        Dr. Ellen Sparry Brush, an anthropologist and expert in the archeology of western coastal Guerrero state in Mexico, died May 1 at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 65 and also lived on Shelter Island, N.Y.
        The cause was a lung disorder, her family said.
        Dr. Brush contributed to the field of early Mesoamerican archeology, concentrating on pre-Columbian figurines. She and her husband and colleague, Dr. Charles F. Brush 3d, surveyed coastal Guerrero for the American Museum of Natural History.
        They turned up some of the earliest evidence of alloyed bronze production on Mexico's west coast. They also unearthed pottery dating to the third millennium B.C., and identified and analyzed early pre-Columbian ceramics.
        Dr. Ellen Brush was a past chairwoman of the Society of Women Geographers. She was one of the first women to be members of the Explorers Club in New York, which honored her this year.
        She was born in Manhattan, graduated from Smith College and earned a Ph.D. in anthropology at Columbia University in 1965.
        In addition to her husband, survivors include a daughter, Dr. Karen A. Brush, and a son, Charles F. 4th, both of Manhattan.
