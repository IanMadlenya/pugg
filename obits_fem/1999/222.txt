        Faith Sale, a publishing executive and the editor of dozens of novels and short-story collections by such authors as Donald Barthelme, Kurt Vonnegut, Joseph Heller, Kaye Gibbons and Amy Tan, died on Wednesday at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 63 and had homes in Greenwich Village and Cold Spring, N.Y.
        The cause was cancer, said her husband, the historian and biographer Kirkpatrick Sale.
        Known as a devoted writers' advocate and a hands-on editor of a decidedly literary bent, Ms. Sale had a career in publishing that spanned four decades, beginning at J. B. Lippincott and including stints at Macmillan and E. P. Dutton. She spent the last 20 years at G. P. Putnam's Sons, where she was vice president and senior executive editor and is said to have introduced a more literary sensibility.
        Her titles there included Mr. Heller's fictional treatment of the life of Rembrandt, ''Picture This'' (1988);  Ms. Tan's breakthrough novel, ''The Joy Luck Club'' (1989); and Mr. Barthelme's collection ''60 Stories'' (1981), which won the PEN/Faulkner fiction award. Most recently she edited Mr. Vonnegut's collection of stories from the 1950's, ''Bagombo Snuff Box,'' which was published in September, and a new novel by Delia Ephron, ''Big City Eyes,'' to be published in March.
        Born Faith Apfelbaum in New York in 1936, she grew up in Manhattan and in New Rochelle, N.Y., and attended Cornell University, where she came under the thrall of an authoritative English professor named William M. Sale Jr. She worked on the school newspaper with his son, Kirk, whom she would marry.
        In addition to her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Rebekah Sale and Kalista Sale Parish, both of New York; a brother, Ben Apfelbaum of Atlanta; and a granddaughter.
