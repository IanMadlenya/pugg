        Tove (Musse) Hansen, who presided over Scandia, a popular Los Angeles restaurant in the 1950's and 60's, after helping Jews flee Denmark during World War II, died last Saturday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 88.
        In 1946, Ms. Hansen's husband, Kenneth, opened Scandia, a French and Scandinavian restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. Over the years, it became one of the best known restaurants in Los Angeles, a destination for Presidents and movie stars. It was sold in 1978 and went out of business about 10 years ago.
        Though Ms. Hansen was not the owner of Scandia, she was known for her presence in the restaurant when it was a celebrity rendezvous.
        Nathan Chroman, a longtime friend of Ms. Hansen's and her lawyer, said that Ms. Hansen, when she lived in Denmark, helped Danish Jews in their mass escape to Sweden.
        He added that she was later honored by Israel and the Israel Bond Organization in Los Angeles for her efforts.
        Ms. Hansen's husband died in 1980; she is survived by a sister, Else Thomasen of Denmark.
