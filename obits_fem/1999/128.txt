        Constance Friess Holman, the first woman to become chief resident in medicine at New York Hospital, died last Friday at Brattleboro Memorial Hospital in Brattleboro, Vt. She was 91.
        The cause was pneumonia, her daughter, Jane Clough, said.
        Despite being first in her class at Cornell Medical School, she got the residency at what is now the New York Weill Cornell Center of Presbyterian Hospital only because the man originally chosen had tuberculosis.
        While studying at Barnard College, she tutored and cared for the grandchildren of Adolph S. Ochs, then the publisher of The New York Times. Mr. Ochs lent her the money to attend medical school and arranged to have the debt forgiven upon his death.
        She retired in 1988 after a long career practicing internal medicine in New York City.
        She was divorced from her first husband, William Alexander Cooper, in 1969. Her second husband, Cranston W. Holman, died in 1993.
        In addition to her daughter, Jane Clough of Paris and Pound Ridge, N.Y., she is survived by a son, Peter A. Cooper of Brattleboro, Vt., and four grandchildren.
