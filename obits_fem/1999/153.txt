        Evelyn Shrifte, the longtime president of Vanguard Press, which published the first books of Saul Bellow, Dr. Seuss and Joyce Carol Oates, died on Aug. 8 at her home on the West Side of Manhattan. She was 98.
        Ms. Shrifte, whose name is pronounced ''Shrift,'' was one of the first women to head a book publishing company. She began working for the independent Vanguard full time in the early 1930's and was its president from 1952 until it was sold to Random House in 1988, when it was 62 years old. For many years it was at 424 Madison Ave., near 49th Street, in Manhattan.
        In his history of American book publishing, ''Between Covers,'' John Tebbel wrote, ''Vanguard never became a large and important house, but it continued to publish quality books year after year.''
        Those books included Mr. Bellow's first two novels, ''Dangling Man'' and ''The Victim''; Dr. Seuss's first two books, ''And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street'' and ''The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins,'' and a score of books by Ms. Oates, including the novel ''Them,'' which won the National Book Award. Ms. Shrifte edited books by Ms. Oates, James T. Farrell, Marshall McLuhan and other authors at Vanguard.
        After the sale she said: ''Random House will take good care of our books and authors. But I'm trying not to cry while I break the news to our authors.'' She said the sale was prompted by the poor health of some of Vanguard's investors. In its last years Vanguard published fewer than 20 new titles annually, but it had 500 books on its backlist.
        A native New Yorker, Ms. Shrifte received a bachelor's degree in 1921 from Barnard. She worked for the Musical Quarterly and opened a bookshop in Manhattan before joining Vanguard. After it was sold, she retired.
        She is survived by a sister, Bernice Woll of Larchmont, N.Y., two nephews, two nieces and four grand-nieces.
