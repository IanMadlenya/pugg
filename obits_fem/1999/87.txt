        Edith Lewin, who with her husband, Bernard, amassed the largest privately owned collection of Mexican modernist art and then gave it away, died on Sunday at her home in Palm Springs, Calif. She was 88.
        The Lewins, who settled in California after fleeing Berlin in 1933, started out as furniture dealers in Los Angeles, selling art along with household items. They eventually opened art galleries in Beverly Hills and Palm Springs. They began acquiring Mexican art in 1958, when they bought three paintings by Diego Rivera.
        Over the next 40 years, during travels in Mexico and through friendships with artists such as Rufino Tamayo and David Siqueiros, they put together a collection of 1,800 paintings and works on paper by, among others, Frida Kahlo, Jose Clemente Orozco, Carlos Merida and Rivera, including the only portrait Rivera ever painted of Kahlo, who was his wife.
        The portrait, dated 1939, will appear in the exhibition ''Diego Rivera: Art and Revolution,'' which opens at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art on Sunday.
        In 1997, the Lewins donated their entire collection, valued at more than $25 million, to the museum.
        Ms. Lewin is survived by her husband, and a son, Ralph, also of Palm Springs.
