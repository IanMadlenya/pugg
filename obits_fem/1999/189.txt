        Wendy Scott, who had one of the most severe cases on record of a syndrome in which people feign illness or make themselves sick to get medical treatment, died on Oct. 14 at a hospice in South London. She was 50.
        The cause was intestinal cancer, said Mary Jane Lang, a friend of Miss Scott.
        Miss Scott, who lived in London, spent 12 years traveling from one hospital to another in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, pretending to be ill so that she could become a patient. She was admitted to hundreds of hospitals and underwent 42 operations, nearly all of them unnecessary.
        Remarkably, Miss Scott recovered from the condition, called Munchausen syndrome, which many doctors consider untreatable.
        In an interview in The New York Times on July 20, Miss Scott said she had not faked her way into a hospital in 20 years. She credited her devotion to a pet with helping her recover. She became so attached to a kitten that she gave up hospitals for fear the kitten would be neglected in her absence.
        In recent years, she tried to help other people with Munchausen syndrome, communicating with them by mail, telephone and Internet. She also approached Dr. Marc Feldman, a psychiatrist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and an expert on Munchausen syndrome, who said she had helped a number of patients.
        In the last year, Ms. Scott became increasingly ill but had difficulty obtaining medical care in London because of her notorious record. While visiting Miss Lang in the United States last summer, she sought help from Dr. Feldman, whose colleagues in Birmingham discovered that she had advanced intestinal cancer.
        Miss Scott remained in the hospital in Birmingham until last month, and then returned to London.
        Miss Scott was born in 1948 in Wemyss, in the Fife region of Scotland near the North Sea. Information about survivors was not available.
