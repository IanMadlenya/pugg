        Vanessa Brown, who originated the role of the girl upstairs in the Broadway production of ''The Seven Year Itch,'' a role played in the film version by Marilyn Monroe, died on Friday at the Motion Picture Country Home in Los Angeles, Calif. She was 71.
        The cause was cancer, her son, David, said.
        Born Smylla Brind in Vienna, Ms. Brown was blessed with beauty and  an I.Q. of 165 that she said made her feel ''squirmy.'' Her family fled the Nazis when she was 9, moving first to France and then to New York, where she came to the attention of the Broadway producer Herman Shumlin. He offered her the role of a 10-year-old Viennese girl in his production of Lillian Hellman's play ''Watch on the Rhine.'' Her parents refused to allow her to leave school, so she understudied Ann Blyth but later stepped into the role.
        While in Chicago with the play, she was a guest on the radio show ''Quiz Kids,'' and did so well that she was offered and accepted a regular spot on the panel. After two years, she returned to New York, then moved to Los Angeles, where she made her first movie, ''Youth Runs Wild'' (1944), at age 16. While in college  she signed up with 20th Century Fox, and appeared in such movies as ''Tarzan and the Slave Girl'' (1950), in which she swung from trees with Lex Barker; ''The Heiress,'' and ''The Ghost and Mrs. Muir.''
        Ms. Brown returned to Broadway in 1952. Her stage career included the tour of ''As You Like It'' with Katharine Hepburn.
        In later years Ms. Brown turned to politics and writing. She was a delegate to the 1956 Democratic Convention and was active in the Presidential campaigns of Adlai Stevenson and John F. Kennedy. As a freelance correspondent for the Voice of America, she covered topics including  politics, science and medicine.
        She is survived by her son, David, and a daughter, Cathy, both of Los Angeles.
