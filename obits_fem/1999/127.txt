        Anne Richardson, former chairwoman of Reading Is Fundamental, the nation's largest organization promoting children's literacy, died on Monday at a hospital in Cheverly, Md. She was 69 and lived in Mitchellville, Md., a Washington suburb, with her husband, former Attorney General Elliot L. Richardson.
        The cause of death was complications of Alzheimer's disease, said her son Henry.
        Ms. Richardson was a founding member of Reading Is Fundamental and served as its chairwoman from  1981 to 1996. By the time she stepped down, the number of children the organization was serving had grown to 3.7 million from 3 million, the volunteer force to 219,000 from about 100,000, and Federal financing to $13.2 million from $7.6 million.
        Ms. Richardson was born Anne Francis Hazard on Dec. 5, 1929, in Providence, R.I., the fourth of five children of a Rhode Island state senator. She graduated magna cum laude from Radcliffe and later served on the Harvard University board of overseers.
        In addition to her husband and her son Henry, who lives in Washington, she is survived by two other children, Nancy Carlson of St. George, Vt., and Michael Richardson of Upper Montclair, N.J.; a sister, Mary Conrad of Albuquerque, N.M.; two brothers, T. P. Hazard Jr. of Rockville, Md., and Oliver C. Hazard of Bedford, N.Y., and seven grandchildren.
