        Monique Beudert, a museum curator who worked in New York and London, died last Saturday at her home in London. She was 48.
        The cause was breast cancer, her family said.
        Ms. Beudert was born on Long Island and studied art history at Connecticut College, earning a B.A. in 1972, and at Hunter College. In 1973 she joined the office of the registrar at the Museum of Modern Art and in 1976 became a curatorial assistant in the department of painting and sculpture. She worked on exhibitions like ''Late Cezanne,'' ''Joseph Cornell'' and ''An International Survey of Painting and Sculpture,'' the opening exhibition in the Modern's 1984 expansion.
        In 1994 she joined the Tate Gallery in London as an associate curator. At the time of her death she was working on an exhibition of the work of  Barnett Newman, the American Abstract Expressionist, to be held in 2002 at the Tate Modern, the Tate's new museum that is to open in the  spring.
        She is survived by her husband, Brian Boylan; her mother, Adele Beudert of Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.; her sisters, Martine, of Brooklyn and Michele Richard of Old Greenwich, Conn.; a brother, Claude, of East Hampton, N.Y., and two stepdaughters, Grace and Serena Boylan of London.
