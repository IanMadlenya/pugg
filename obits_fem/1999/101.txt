        Helena Kuo Kingman, the author of several books about China, died on April 25 at a hospital in Taipei, Taiwan. She was 86 and lived in Manhattan.
        Mrs. Kingman was in Taiwan to attend a reception for her husband, the painter Dong Kingman, at the Taiwan Museum of Art in Taichung.
        In the 1930's Mrs. Kingman was a reporter for The Shanghai Evening News and other Chinese newspapers. When the Japanese invaded China in 1937, she fled to England and became a columnist for The Daily Mail of London. Two years later, she moved to the United States.
        Her first book, ''Peach Path'' (Methuen), was published in 1940. She  wrote three more books, all, like her first, under the name Helena Kuo, and another with her husband.
        Mrs. Kingman was born in Macao  and graduated from Shanghai University. She served as an adviser to the movie ''China'' (1943), starring William Bendix, Loretta Young and Alan Ladd. She was also a writer, broadcaster and translator for the Voice of America and the United States Information Agency.
        Besides her husband, Mrs. Kingman is survived by two stepsons, Eddie Kingman of Garden Grove, Calif., and Dong Kingman Jr. of Manhattan, and four step-grandchildren.
