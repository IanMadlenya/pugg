        Molly Harrower, a clinical psychologist who devised a Rorschach test for use in group therapy, died Feb. 20 at her home in Gainesville, Fla. She was 93.
        Dr. Harrower developed her own set of inkblot cards to administer to groups of Canadian military recruits in World War II. Known as the Harrower Blots, the tests were used to help analyze personality traits through a subject's interpretation of a standard series of inkblot designs.
        She also refined diagnostic tests to measure tolerance for stress.
        With Dawn Bowers, she edited ''The Inside Story: Self-Evaluations Reflecting Basic Rorschach Types'' (Erlbaum, 1987.)
        Among her other titles were ''Appraising Personality'' (1952), ''Personality Change and Development'' (1958), ''The Practice of Clinical Psychology'' (1962), ''Psychodiagnostic Testing: An Empirical Approach'' (1965) and ''The Psychologist at Work'' (revised edition, 1971). She also wrote ''The Therapy of Poetry'' in 1974 and contributed to ''The Quest for the Nazi Personality: A Psychological Investigation of Nazi War Criminals.''
        Dr. Harrower, a native of South Africa, was educated in England and graduated with a degree in psychology from the University of London in 1928. She briefly studied dance and painting in France but was persuaded to continue her education on a fellowship at Smith College with the theorist Kurt Koffka, a founder of Gestalt theory.
        Working for Koffka, she obtained her Ph.D. at Smith in 1934. The association prompted her book ''Kurt Koffka: An Unwitting Self-Portrait,'' reprinted in 1983.
        Over the years, she was in private practice in New York, worked as a psychologist for Federal agencies and taught at universities in various parts of the country before moving to the University of Florida in 1968. She retired in the mid-1970's.
        Her husband, Mortimer Lahm, died in 1967.
