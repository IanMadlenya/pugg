        Joann Grillo, a mezzo-soprano who sang in nearly 300 performances with the Metropolitan Opera over a career of some 20 years, died on Monday at Victory Memorial Hospital in Brooklyn. She was 59 and lived in Brooklyn.
        She had been recuperating from recent surgery when she suffered a heart attack, said a friend and associate, Samantha La Viale.
        Born on May 14, 1939, in New York, Ms. Grillo first won attention as a singer with the Brooklyn Opera Company in the early 1960's. Reviewing her portrayal of Azucena in Verdi's ''Trovatore'' in 1961, Eric Salzman wrote in The New York Times, ''She showed a voice of size and quality, and she knew how to use it.''
        She made her Met debut as Rosette in Massenet's ''Manon'' in the fall of 1963. Though she sang occasional leading roles at the Met (Carmen and Azucena among them), her value to the company was as a dependable, dramatically involving singer of supporting roles, like Maddalena in Verdi's ''Rigoletto'' and Grimgerde in Wagner's ''Walkure.''
        With other international companies she was heard in major mezzo-soprano roles, including Massenet's Charlotte and Verdi's Eboli.
        In 1981, she and her husband, Richard Kness, a dramatic tenor, founded the Ambassadors of Opera and Concert Worldwide, an independent company that brought opera, musicals and vocal concerts to places as distant as Singapore, Guam, Malaysia, Pakistan and the Fiji Islands. The tours were filled with adventure, Ms. Grillo once said in an interview. As singing actors, she and her husband had to die standing up on tiny stages, and they once had to pry a member of their company from an Asian sewer. When they performed in Beijing one month after the 1989 crackdown in Tiananmen Square, they drew  criticism in the international press.
        Ms. Grillo is survived by her husband and a son, Jonathan, a tenor.
