        Zohara Schatz, a sculptor who designed a symbolic menorah for the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, died on Tuesday in Jerusalem after a long illness.
        She was 83.
        Ms. Schatz's aluminum six-branched candelabrum of 1985 represented the six million Jews killed in the Holocaust. The piece, considered Yad Vashem's emblem, marks the entrance to the memorial.
        The menorah is lighted once a year, on Holocaust Remembrance Day, or Yom ha-Shoah.
        In 1954, Ms. Schatz, who created abstract works in metals and plastics, was the first woman to win the Israel Prize. The country's president bestows the award to distinguished scholars, writers, artists and public figures. She won the prize when she headed the Department of Arts and Crafts in the Israel's Industry and Trade Ministry.
        She also won the Dizengoff Prize and awards from Yad Vashem and the Museum of Modern Art.
        Her sculptures and decorative works are featured at sites throughout Jerusalem, and her work also has been shown in the Metropolitan Museum of Art and in New York galleries.
        Her father, Boris Schatz, founded the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design in Jerusalem. Ms. Schatz studied at Bezalel and later taught there, and she was a member of Yad Vashem's board of directors.
        She dedicated her final years to promoting the members of the Jerusalem Artists Association and those in the Artists' Village at Ein Hod in northern Israel.
        Ms. Schatz is survived by cousins.
