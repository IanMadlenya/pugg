        Correction:  February 2, 1999, Tuesday  An obituary on Friday about Rita V. Tishman, a New York benefactor of Jewish and civic causes, referred incorrectly to a Jewish women's organization she served as president, and to an organization it sponsored for the blind. She headed the National Council of Jewish Women New York Section, not its umbrella group, the National Council of Jewish Women Inc. The New York Section established the Jewish Guild for the Blind; the guild is not associated with the Lighthouse.
