        Eve F. Kraft, a tennis teacher, coach, author and the founder and former executive director of the Education and Research Committee of the United States Tennis Association, died Thursday at Princeton Hospital.
        She was 73 years old and lived in Princeton, N.J.
        The cause of death was cancer, her family said.
        Kraft began giving tennis lessons to her children and their friends on a court behind her house in 1955 and was soon teaching the fundamentals to thousands of amateur players through the Princeton Community Tennis Program.
        Bill Talbert, the legendary doubles and singles champion, once described the program as ''a leader in the field in developing new materials and experimenting with new ways to teach tennis in group situations.''
        Kraft, an enthusiast who kept the notes from her first tennis lesson at age 12, wrote ''The Tennis Workbook,'' a learning and practice guide for beginners, and ''The Tennis Teacher's Guide to Group Instruction and Community Tennis Programming.''
        In 1971, when Princeton University first admitted women, Kraft became the women's varsity tennis coach, leading the team to an undefeated record for the three years of her tenure.
        Kraft was the co-founder and director of the U.S.T.A. tennis teachers' conference held annually during the United States Open.
        She was inducted into the U.S.T.A./ Middle States Tennis Hall of Fame in 1994 and into the International Tennis Association's Women's Collegiate Hall of Fame in 1996.
        A native of Philadelphia, Kraft received a bachelor's degree in political science in 1947 from Antioch College.
        She is survived by two sons, Kenneth of Haverford, Pa., and Robert of Los Angeles; four grandchildren; and her companion, G. Reginald Bishop Jr.
