        Janet Bode, the author of 14 nonfiction books with socially conscious themes for young adults, died yesterday at her home in Greenwich Village in Manhattan. She was 56.
        The cause was breast cancer, said her companion of many years, Stan Mack, the cartoonist.
        Ms. Bode's books were about interracial dating, teenage immigrants, rape, sibling rivalry, teenage parents, troubled love, friendship, eating disorders and other concerns of young people. Her literary technique, she explained to an interviewer in 1997, was to pick a topic resonant with meaning for teenagers, interview hundreds of young adults across the country and then present their comments verbatim.
        Among her books were ''Death Is Hard to Live With,'' ''Voices of Rape'' and ''The Colors of Freedom'' (1999), a book addressed to teenage immigrants. Her books are not the kind usually reviewed by critics, but their value to troubled or perplexed young adults has been recognized by organizations like the American Library Association, which designated six of her titles Best Books for Young Adults.
        Ms. Bode was born on July 14, 1943, in Penn Yan, N.Y., the daughter of the late Carl Bode, a professor of English and American Studies at the University of Maryland, and the former Charlotte Watkins Smith. She attended schools in London in the late 1950's when her father was cultural attache at the American Embassy there. She graduated from the University of Maryland in 1965.
        In addition to Mr. Mack, Ms. Bode is survived by two sisters, Barbara, of Washington, and Carolyn, of Santa Monica, Calif.
