        Eufrosina Raileanu, the principal violist of the New York City Opera Orchestra and a busy freelance player who worked with several chamber groups, died on Saturday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 39 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was complications from breast cancer, said Sato Moughalian, a friend.
        Ms. Raileanu, who was known as Zina, was born in Romania in 1960 and came to the United States in 1978 as part of a group of teenagers who had won musical competitions and were allowed to study abroad. Ms. Raileanu, along with most of the others in the group, decided to remain in the United States.
        She earned a master's degree at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester and a doctorate at the Juilliard School, where she studied with Lillian Fuchs.
        As a chamber music player, Ms. Raileanu performed as a guest with the Juilliard Quartet, the Mendelssohn Quartet, the Sea Cliff Chamber Players, the Da Capo Chamber Players and the Chelsea Chamber Ensemble. She joined the New York City Opera as principal violist in 1988.
        In addition to her work at the New York City Opera, she was a substitute violist for the New York Philharmonic and the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, with which she toured and recorded.
        Ms. Raileanu is survived by her mother, Sylvia, of Brooklyn; a brother, Val, of Manhattan; and her father, Nicolau, who lives in Romania.
