        Mrs. Bell died of breast cancer, said her husband, Derrick.
        Mrs. Bell was born in Pittburgh and graduated from the Carnegie Insitute of Technology, now Carnegie Mellon University. She also studied psychiatric social work at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.
        She was a social worker and education specialist with the Bureau of Equal Opportunity of the Massachusett Department of Education from 1977 to 1980. She later headed the Council on Minority Education at the University of Oregon for three years before returning to Massachusetts, where she was named head of the Tufts center in 1988.
        Mrs. Bell's husband, a professor at Harvard Law School, has been on an unpaid leave of absence since April and says he will remain so in protest until Harvard appoints a black woman to its tenured law faculty.
        Mrs. Bell is also survived by three sons, Derrick 3rd, Douglass, and Carter, all of Cambridge, and a sister, Jessica Shufford, of Fort Washington, Md.
