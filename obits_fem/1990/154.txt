        Carolyn Wolsey Ferriday, a philanthropist who helped to bring some Polish women who had been used by the Nazis for medical experiments, to the United States for treatment, died Tuesday at her home in Bethlehem, Conn., after a long illness. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan and at Bellamy House in Bethlehem, an historic landmark.
        Miss Ferriday, who began her career as an actress in the 1920's and later turned to philanthropy, was a staunch supporter of the French Resistance during World War II. She was a member of France Forever and was awarded the Legion of Honor by the French Government for her work.
        In the 1950's, with the aid of Norman Cousins of Saturday Review magazine and others, she helped to bring a number of Polish survivors of Nazi medical experiments to this country for treatment.
        The women were known as ''lapins,'' or rabbits, and had been inmates at the Ravensbruck concentration camp near Berlin in World War II.
        The women had been separated into three groups. Some went to decompression chambers for testing human limits to high altitudes; others were immersed in tubs of ice water for testing human limits to low temperature and the third group was sent to operating rooms for bone extractions and the insertion of infectious materials to test new sulfanilamide drugs.
        Miss Ferriday also worked to obtain financial compensation for them from the West German Government.
        There are no immediate survivors.
