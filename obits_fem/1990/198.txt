        Millicent Miller, who worked as Vivien Leigh's stand-in during the filming of ''Gone With the Wind,'' died on Tuesday. She was 81 years old.
        Mrs. Miller was hired from a group of more than 300 applicants for the job of Leigh's stand-in. She appeared in the movie as Scarlett O'Hara hiding under a bridge while a wagon is passing overhead.
        It was her hand that pulled a turnip from the ground after the ruination of Scarlett's plantation Tara, and it was her hand drawing a revolver from a drawer before Scarlett shot a Union soldier.
        She is survived by a husband, Jimmy, a daughter and a granddaughter.
