        Dr. Bunzel, a native New Yorker, joined Columbia in the early 1920's and retired in the 1970's. She was an authority on the Zuni Indians and learned their language. She was adopted into a Zuni household where she lived and studied in the 1920's. Her work there was done under the auspices of the Social Science Research Council.
        Dr. Bunzel was the author of several books including ''The Zuni Text,'' (American Ethnological Society; 1933), and ''The Golden Age of Anthropology,'' with Margaret Mead (George Brazillier; 1960).
        Dr. Bunzel was a graduate of Barnard College and received a Ph.D. from Columbia.
        There are no immediate survivors.
