        Ms. Brandeis began teaching at Bard in 1944 after teaching at Sarah Lawrence College and at the New School for Social Research and working for the Office of War Information. She retired in 1979 but still taught occasionally.
        She graduated from Barnard College and did graduate work at Columbia University. She wrote ''The Ladder of Vision: A Study of Dante's Comedy,'' published by Doubleday Books in 1961. She also wrote many articles on Dante and translated other Italian and French writers.
