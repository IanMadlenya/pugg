        Jean Sovatkin Picker, a former United States delegate to the United Nations, died yesterday at her home in Camden, Me., after a long illness. She was 69 years old.
        Mrs. Picker was appointed a delegate by President Johnson in 1968. She was reappointed special senior adviser to the delegations to six subsequent General Assemblies and to eight sessions of the Economic and Social Council under Presidents Nixon and Ford.
        Mrs. Picker was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Smith College. She went to work for Life magazine as a researcher and became a member of the editorial board and a correspondent.
        Her association with the United Nations began in 1953, when she became a volunteer lecturer with its Office of Public Information.
        From 1958 to 1968, she was a member of the Committee of Correspondence, which trained women from poorer countries for leadership roles.
        Friend of Eleanor Roosevelt
        In 1978, Mrs. Picker became director of the United Nations Association of the United States, an independent group founded by Eleanor Roosevelt to educate others about the nature and function of the United Nations.
        In 1955, she collaborated with Mrs. Roosevelt to write ''The United Nations: What You Should Know About It.'' The collaboration became a friendship, and in 1973, she wrote ''Eleanor Roosevelt: Her Day.''
        In 1988, Mrs. Picker became the first recipient of the Eleanor Roosevelt Leadership Award for her commitment to international cooperation.
        She is survived by her husband, Harvey Picker, dean emeritus of the School of International Affairs at Columbia University, and two daughters, Frances Mrachek of Newton, Mass., and Gale Picker of Falls Church, Va.
