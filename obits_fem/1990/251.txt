        She graduated in 1933 from Douglass College at Rutgers University, where she majored in journalism. During the 1930's and the 1940's, she edited The American Mercury, which was founded in 1924 by H. L. Mencken and George Jean Nathan.
        After her tenure at The American Mercury, Mrs. Loew became editor of the Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine. In 1957, she was co-author, with Mary Merrill, of ''The Weekend Cook,'' published by Coward McCann.
        Mrs. Loew was a granddaughter of Henry L. Einstein, the former owner of The New York Press, a daily newspaper that was published during the first two decades of this century.
        She is survived by a daughter, Alison, of Los Angeles; a son, Edgar Valentine Loew of Manhattan; a sister, Eleanor F. Lenzner of Manhattan, and a brother, Myron S. Falk Jr. of Manhattan.
