        Ms. Mason died of a stroke, a spokesman for her estate said.
        Ms. Mason, a painter, opened the Keane-Mason Gallery at 50 West 57th Street in 1979. It went out of business in 1982. She also produced craft exhibits and outdoor festivals to provide revenue for nonprofit groups, among them the Women's Museum Group.
        She was born in St. Albans, Queens, graduated from Brown University and received a master's degree in fine arts from New York University.
        She is survived by her husband, Cedric Peirce.
