        Ann Stringer, a war correspondent who in 1945 transmitted the first report of the linkup of American and Russian forces, died of a heart attack Wednesday at the Skyrest Nursing Home in Carbondale, Ill. She was 71 years old and had lived until 1987 in Manhattan and Amagansset, L.I.
        On April 25, 1945, as a reporter for United Press, Mrs. Stringer was ordered back to Paris from the First Army front. She persuaded friends in Army Intelligence to lend her a plane and a pilot, who flew her over the lines to the village of Torgau. There she spotted a man climbing out of the Elbe River. She got him to row her across to the east bank in a racing shell. There she met the Russian troops.
        Mrs. Stringer got a ride to Paris on a C-47 cargo plane, thus beating her competitors, who were being taken back by jeep.
        Less than a year earlier, Mrs. Stringer had been widowed when her husband, William, a correspondent for Reuters, was killed as Allied troops liberated Paris. In 1949, she left United Press and settled in Manhattan.
        Surviving are a brother, Robert Harrell of Carbondale, and a sister, Jane Ferguson of Norcross, Ga.
