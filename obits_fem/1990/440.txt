        Gwen Harold Terasaki, whose book "Bridge to the Sun," about her life as the wife of a Japanese diplomat during World War II in Japan, became a best seller and a movie, died on Saturday after a brief illness. She was 84 years old.
        Mrs. Terasaki, a native of Johnson City, Tenn., married Hidenari Terasaki in 1931. After spending the war years in Japan, she returned to Tennessee in 1949 with their daughter, Mariko. Her husband died in Japan in 1951. Mrs. Terasaki moved to Wyoming in 1986.
        "Bridge to the Sun," published by the University of North Carolina Press in 1957, detailed the family's experiences during the war. The movie came out in 1961, with Carroll Baker playing Mrs. Terasaki.
        In addition to her daughter, Mrs. Terasaki is survived by two grandsons and two great-grandchildren.
