        Sonya Selby-Wright, an associate producer of special programs for "Good Morning America," died on Wednesday in her home in Point Pleasant, N.J. She was 54 years old.
        She died of a pulmonary embolism, said her husband, Julian Mueller.
        Born in London, Ms. Selby-Wright moved to the United States in 1963. She was an associate producer of "The Mike Douglas Show" before taking over special programs at "Good Morning America" in 1977.
        A profile in Cook's magazine last year credited Ms. Selby-Wright with single-handedly coaching chefs for television appearances and with perfecting the presentation of food on television. She worked with culinary figures including Julia Child, Wolfgang Puck and Lorenzo De Medici. "Her talents for creating a kitchen drama in three and a half minutes were awesome," Mrs. Child said yesterday. "I am indeed indebted to her."
        In addition to her husband, Ms. Selby-Wright is survived by her mother, Mary Chamberlain, and a sister, Claire Wright, both of England.
        A funeral service is to be held tomorrow at 1 P.M. at the Point Pleasant Baptist Church.

        An obituary on Friday about Sonya Selby-Wright, a television producer, misidentified her residence. It was Point Pleasant, Pa., not New Jersey.
