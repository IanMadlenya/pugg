        Edna Ramsaier Yardley, the widow and collaborator of Herbert O. Yardley, a pioneer code breaker, died of a stroke on Tuesday at her home. She was 87 years old.
        She was Mr. Yardley's assistant in the American Black Chamber operation that he established in 1919 in New York City. In 1921 that group broke the Japanese diplomatic code, enabling the United States to know Japanese negotiating positions in the 1922 naval disarmament conference in Washington.
        She remained in New York after the chamber was abolished by Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson in 1929 with the oft-quoted aphorism, ''Gentlemen do not read each other's mail.''
        In 1940, she joined the Army's Signal Intelligence Service, the organization that again broke Japanese diplomatic codes.
        In 1941 she left the Army to rejoin Mr. Yardley in establishing a Canadian coding service. The two were married in 1944.
        A first marriage had ended in divorce. Mr. Yardley, considered the father of American crytography, died in 1958. Mrs. Yardley is survived by a sister, Lillian R. Meyer of Whiting, N.J.
