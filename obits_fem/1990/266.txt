        The cause of death was cancer, a family friend, Jeremiah Newton, said.
        Born in New York City, Mrs. Blair-Hastings was a graduate of Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville. She began work on the Duncan biography, titled ''Isadora, Portrait of the Artist as a Woman,'' in the 1950's. During the next decade she produced a dance documentary starring Anna Duncan, Julia Levien and Hortense Kooluris, all exponents of Duncan dance.
        Mrs. Blair-Hastings is survived by her husband, Jerome Hastings, and a sister, Helen Votichenko, of Scotsdale, Ariz.
