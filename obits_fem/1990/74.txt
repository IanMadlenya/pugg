        Valborg Anderson, professor emeritus of the English department at Brooklyn College, died of Alzheimer's disease yesterday at a nursing home in Colton, Ore. She was 78 years old and moved to Colton from Manhattan two years ago.
        Professor Anderson joined the staff of Brooklyn College in the mid-1940's and remained there as a teacher until 1976, when she retired. She was a Bollinger Fellow, receiving a stipend that enabled her to carry on her research on the poet William Wordsworth. Professor Anderson graduated from the University of Oregon and received a doctorate in English from Brown University.
        She is survived by a brother, Rognar Anderson of Colton, and a sister, Eleanor Kearnes of Oregon City, Ore.
