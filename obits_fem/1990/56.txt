        Margaret Kelly, the mother of the late Princess Grace of Monaco and the matriarch of the famed Kelly family of Philadelphia, died of pneumonia Saturday at a convalescent home here. She was 91 years old.
        She had lived at the home, the Linwood Convalescent Center, since 1982, and had suffered several strokes in recent years.
        Mrs. Kelly was the first director of women's athletics at the University of Pennsylvania, and had also worked as a model. She was known both for her own accomplishments and those of her husband and children, particularly her daughter, the actress Grace Kelly, who later married Prince Rainier of Monaco. Princess Grace died in an automobile accident in September 1982.
        Mrs. Kelly's husband, John B. Kelly Sr., was an Olympic rowing champion who parlayed his skills as a bricklayer into a construction empire. He died in 1960.
        Mrs. Kelly is survived by two daughters, Margaret R. Conlan of Philadelphia and Lizanne K. LeVine of Gladwyne, Pa.; 13 grandchildren, and 17 great-grandchildren.
