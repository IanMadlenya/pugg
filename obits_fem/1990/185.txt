        Nessa Brickman Wolfson, a professor of educational linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania, died of breast cancer on Saturday at her home in the Philadelphia suburb of Huntingdon Valley. She was 56 years old.
        Dr. Wolfson was a specialist in applying linguistics to social behavior and in teaching English as a second language.
        A native of Philadelphia, she earned a B.A. degree in French literature at the University of Pennsylvania in 1957, helped raise a family, then returned to the university and, in 1976, earned a Ph.D. in linguistics and joined the faculty.
        Dr. Wolfson aided many new immigrants to Philadelphia as a board member of a university-city school for Asian youths and as a consultant at a downtown service center. Early this year was the keynote speaker at the International Colloquium on Sociolinguistics in Africa, held in Durban, South Africa.
        Her survivors, all of the Philadelphia area, include her husband, Harvey; two sons, C. Daniel and Mark, and a daughter, Miriam.
