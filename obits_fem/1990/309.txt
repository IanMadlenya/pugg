        Lillian Pickard, a theater and television press agent, died yesterday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Medical Center. She was 66 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She died as a result of internal bleeding, said a friend and colleague, Sheldon Roskin.
        Ms. Pickard began her career as a press agent in the mid-1940's and joined the firm of Salters, Roskin & Friedman in 1957. Among her accounts were the Barbra Streisand television specials, the Tournament of Roses Parade, the Bob Hope Chrysler Theater and ''Empire,'' a weekly television series starring Richard Egan. In 1987, she was injured in a car accident, which left her unable to work.
        She is survived by her mother, Frieda Pickard of Yonkers, and two daughters, Beth and Jamie Kushnick, of Manhattan.
