        Colette Audry, a prize-winning novelist, screenwriter and critic, died on Saturday at Issy-les-Moulineaux southwest of Paris, her family reported. She was 84 years old.
        No cause of death was given.
        Miss Audry received wide acclaim in 1946 for her screenplay for the film "The Battle for the Railway," an account of French rail workers' resistance to the Nazi Occupation, and she won the Medicis Prize, a top French literary award, in 1962 for her autobiographical novel "Behind the Bathtub."
        Miss Audry was born in Orange in southern France. She taught letters at the Lycee Moliere in Paris and was an accomplished literary critic, especially on the works of the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. She collaborated with Sartre on the Revue des Temps Modernes, wrote several books and plays, and directed the Editions Denoel publishing house.
        She wrote the screenplays for several films directed by her sister Jacqueline, including "Sophie's Unhappiness" in 1946 and "Bitter Fruit," which won the Grand Prix of French Cinema, in 1966.
        Miss Audry ran as a Socialist candidate for the National Assembly in 1962 and 1967 and served on the party steering committee from 1971 to 1981.
