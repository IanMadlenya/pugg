        Li Zhen, a veteran of the Long March and the first woman to become a general in China, died on March 11, China Daily said today. She was 83 years old.
        President Yang Shangkun and military officers paid last respects to her on Thursday, the newspaper said. It did not give the cause of death.
        Miss Li was promoted to major general in 1955 and until 1988 was the only woman serving as a general in the Chinese Army, China Daily said. The 3.5 million-member army is now believed to have four women who are generals.
        Official biographies say she was born in Liuyang, in Hunan Province, and given away by her parents at age 6. In 1926, she fled her husband and joined the Communist Party. She took part in the 1927 Autumn Uprising in Hunan, Mao's first attempt to lead peasants in revolt against the authorities.
        She took part in the 1934-35 Long March, the Red Army's epic escape from the ruling Nationalists to northern China, and held political positions in the army. The Communists defeated the Nationalists and took power in 1949.
        She served as director of the Political Department of the Chinese military force in Korea during the Korean War.
