        Daisy Wilson Cave, the last known Confederate widow of the Civil War, died Saturday at a nursing home here. She was estimated to have been 97 to 105 years old.
        Mrs. Cave was in her 20's when she married Henry Benjamin Cave, then a 75-year-old veteran of the South Carolina Cavalry's Third Regiment.
        At her funeral Tuesday, members of the South Carolina Sons of Confederate Veterans, dressed in Confederate uniforms and carrying flags of the Confederacy and the United States, led the procession and fired a salute.
        More than a dozen United Daughters of the Confederacy attended the service.
        Newspapers have described her as the last surviving Confederate widow.

        In an interview last year, Mrs. Cave said her husband, who died in 1930, spoke little of his time as a soldier.
        ''He always said it was just too bad,'' she said. ''He'd been through it one time and that was all there was to it.''
        South Carolina records show that Mrs. Cave's husband was born in 1844 and enlisted in the Confederate Army in 1862. He had two wives before marrying Daisy Cave. The couple had one son, Benjamin Cave, who died in September.
        Mrs. Cave is survived by grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren.
