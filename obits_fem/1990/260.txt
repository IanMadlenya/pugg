        She sang on recordings with Leo Reisman, Enric Madriguerra and others. She and her husband, Alex Kramer, who had been her voice teacher, wrote such hit songs as ''High on a Windy Hill,'' ''Far Away Places'' and ''Candy.'' The couple were nominated to the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1982.
        Mrs. Kramer is survived by her husband and son, and a sister, Renee Rylander of Newark, Del.
