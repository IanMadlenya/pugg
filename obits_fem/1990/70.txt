        Margaret Feurer Plass, an anthropologist and a historian of African art, died Saturday at her home in Philadelphia. She was 94 years old.
        With her husband, Webster Plass, to whom she was married for 35 years until his death in 1952, she maintained a collection of African art that was said to be one of the finest assembled in this century. It was given to the British Museum after Mr. Plass's death.
        A native of Haverford, Pa., and a graduate of Bryn Mawr College, Mrs. Plass joined the Naval Reserve in World War I. She met and married Mr. Plass, a naval officer and later a consulting engineer whose work took them to many parts of the world. They lived for long periods in Africa.
        Mrs. Plass lectured at La Salle University, the University of Pennsylvania and Bryn Mawr. She was a research associate of the University Museum of Philadelphia, a Fellow of the Royal Anthropological Society and a member of the Order of the British Empire.
        There are no immediate survivors.
