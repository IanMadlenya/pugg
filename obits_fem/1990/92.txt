        Gloria Carter Spann, the last surviving sibling of former President Jimmy Carter, died of pancreatic cancer Monday at Sumter Regional Hospital here. She was 63 years old.  It was in December that Mrs. Spann was found to be suffering from the disease, which killed her father, James Earl Carter; her sister, Ruth Stapleton, and her other brother, Billy.
        Her mother, Lillian Carter, had breast cancer that had spread to other organs, including her pancreas, when she died in 1983.
        Mrs. Spann was an avid motorcyclist and belonged to the Georgia Motorcycle Rights Organization. In 1977 she collected letters sent by her mother from India, where Lillian Carter served in the Peace Corps, for a book, ''Away From Home: Letters to My Family.'' It was published by Simon & Schuster.
        In addition to her brother, she is survived by her husband, Walter, and a son, William.
