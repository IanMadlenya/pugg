        Miss Eddy, who was raised in Los Angeles, was attracted to films by the old Philadelphia-based studios of Siegmund Lubin, which had just opened a Los Angeles lot in her neighborhood.
        Her first film in 1915 was ''The Red Virgin.'' She moved from the Lubin company to Paramount Studios and began to play the roles for which she became known.
        In addition to ''Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm,'' her films included ''The March Hare''(1921), ''The Dark Angel'' (1925), ''Camille,'' ''Quality Street'' and ''The Divine Lady,'' all in 1927, and ''Girls Demand Excitement'' (1931).
        Her last movie was ''Strike Up the Band,'' in 1940.
        There are no survivors.
