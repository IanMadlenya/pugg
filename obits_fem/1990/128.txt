        Mrs. Winn, a native of Weehawken, N.J., started her career in the fashion industry in the 1930's. In 1949 she began designing moderate-priced women's clothing under the ''Suzy Perette'' label.
        She retired as ''Suzy Perette'' in 1963 and a year later opened a dress shop at 19 West 57th Street carrying custom and ready-to-wear fashions of her own design. The shop closed in 1967.
        Her first marriage, to James Fitzsimmins, ended in divorce.
        She is survived by her husband, Lawrence Winn.
