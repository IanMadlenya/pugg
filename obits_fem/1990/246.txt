        Evelyn Klein Spitalny, a violinist who was the concertmaster in Phil Spitalny's All-Girl Orchestra, died on Sunday at a hospital in Miami Beach. She was 79 years old and died of heart failure, said the executor of her estate, Barton S. Goldberg.
        Mrs. Spitalny was born in New York City. She graduated with honors from the Institute of Musical Art, now the Juilliard School, in the early 1930's, and she was a fellowship student at the Institute's graduate school. She joined the Spitalny All-Girl Orchestra while still pursuing a solo career, making a Carnegie Hall debut in 1937. She married Mr. Spitalny in 1945.
        As concertmaster of the orchestra, she received top billing as Evelyn and Her Magic Violin, both in the group's live performances and on its radio show, ''The Hour of Charm.'' The orchestra was active until Mr. Spitalny retired in 1955. Mrs. Spitalny also collaborated with her husband in writing several songs, including ''Save the Last Dance for Me'' and ''Pining for You.''
        There are no survivors.
