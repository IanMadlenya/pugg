        Miss Oakes spent 17 months from late 1945 to early 1947 as the only outsider living in Todos Santos, a remote village in the Guatemalan highlands, where she studied the pre-Columbian roots of the Indians living there.
        In 1951 she published two books about her findings, ''Beyond the Windy Place,'' about life among the Indians, and '' The Two Crosses of Todos Santos,'' detailing the survival of Mayan religious ritual.
        Miss Oakes was born in Seattle and grew up in Manhattan. She developed an interest in the Indians' past while vacationing on Bainbridge Island in Puget Sound.
        Her most recent book, ''The Stone Speaks: The Memoir of a Personal Transformation,'' was published in 1987.
        Miss Oakes is survived by a niece, Mary Barnard of Olympia, Wash., and a nephew, Alfred Woolsey of Santa Barbara, Calif.
