        Mrs. Hasebroock served as president of the organization, which has members in 41 countries, including 500,000 in the United States, from 1964 to 1966.
        In the late 1960's she received South Korea's highest citizen award, the Public Welfare Medal, for the federation's support for Shin-ai Village, a 50-home settlement for Korean War widows and their children. The federation had provided the aid at Mrs. Hasebroock's behest.
        She is survived by a son, Robert of Lincoln; three grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.
