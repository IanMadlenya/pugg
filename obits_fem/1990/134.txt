        Mrs. Krautter, who grew up in Chicago, was still in high school when her first writing was published, in newspapers and then in magazines. She wrote poetry, then turned to short stories, which appeared in magazines like Story, McCall's, The Saturday Evening Post and Good Housekeeping.
        She turned one of her stories, ''The Sainted Sisters,'' into a play, which was made into a film starring Veronica Lake and Joan Caulfield in 1948.
        She developed another of her stories, ''The Horse Called Pete,'' into a children's book in 1948, the first of 28 books for young people.
        Her first novel, ''On What Strange Stuff,'' was published by Doubleday in 1935. She also wrote nonfiction articles and newspaper and magazine columns, and she taught writers' workshops. She was married to L. Martin Krautter, an advertising executive, who died in 1984.
        Surviving are two daughters, Elena Lonsdorf of Atlanta and Elizabeth Treadwell of New York, and four grandchildren.
