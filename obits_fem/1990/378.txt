        She died of complications of cancer, a funeral home representative said.
        She was president of the foundation, located in Manhattan for many years but now in Stamford, Conn., from 1968 until illness forced her to retire in May. She was named to the foundation's board in 1965. She was a graduate of St. Mary's Academy in Newburgh, N.Y., and had been an executive secretary for many years before joining the foundation.
        She is survived by two nephews.
