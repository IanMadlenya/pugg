        Dr. Ross, who earned a Ph.D. at Columbia University, was a teaching assistant with Margaret Mead from 1969 to 1972. She studied primitive warfare among the Achuara Jivaro Indians in northwestern Peru for two years. Her research on human aggression is the subject of a new book, ''The Balance of Deaths'' (University of Arizona Press).
        She had also taught at Brooklyn and Mount Holyoke Colleges and Fordham and New York Universities.
        Also surviving are her parents, Warren and Mary Bennett of Sarasota, Fla., and another sister, Anne Tremaine of Oakland, Calif.
