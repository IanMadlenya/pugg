        Katharine Fisher Schwab, one of the first women to become an officer in the Navy at the outset of World War II, died on Monday at Danbury Hospital in Connecticut. She was 92 years old and lived in Danbury.
        She died of respiratory failure, her nephew, J. Christopher Schwab of White Plains, said.
        Miss Schwab was a 1919 graduate of Vassar College. She enlisted in the Waves after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and was in the first class of officer candidates at Mount Holyoke College. She was commissioned as a lieutenant and was mustered out of the service in 1945 with the rank of lieutenant commander.
        She was a member of the Danbury Zoning Commission and was president of the Danbury chapter of the League of Women Voters.
        She is survived by two nephews and four nieces.
