        Miss Masten began reading to children shortly before Christmas in 1922. She became head of the library's Children's Reading Room in 1927 and retired in 1960. She received hundreds of grateful letters from city children and adults on her retirement.
        She attended the University of Wisconsin and graduated from the Church School of Art in Chicago. She was also a graduate of Columbia University's School of Library Science.
