        Alison Leggatt, an actress who won renown in plays by John Osborne and Harold Pinter, died on Sunday, her family said today. She was 86 years old.
        Alison Joy Seetah Leggatt became an actress against the wishes of her well-to-do parents. Her mother refused ever to see her act, considering the stage unsuitable for a well-bred young woman.
        Her performance in 1927 in ''The Fanatics'' by Miles Malleson established her as one of the most promising theatrical newcomers of her generation.
        During the 1930's, she appeared in Noel Coward's ''Cavalcade,'' playing a honeymooning wife on the Titanic just before it struck the iceberg. She also acted in plays by Clifford Bax and J. B. Priestley.
        After World War II, she was Lavinia in T. S. Eliot's ''Cocktail Party'' with Rex Harrison and Margaret Leighton, and Mrs. Guzzard in Eliot's ''Confidential Clerk.'' She played the emotionally restrained landlady in ''Epitaph for George Dillon,'' by Mr. Osborne and Anthony Creighton, in London and New York. In the early 1960's she was Flora in Mr. Pinter's ''Slight Ache.''
        Although her theater career ended in the late 1960's, she continued to appear on television and had movie roles in ''Far From the Madding Crowd,'' ''Goodbye, Mr. Chips'' and ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.''
