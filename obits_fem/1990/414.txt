        Joanne Dempsey, a professor of English at the University of San Diego, died last Thursday at her home in the Mission Hills section of San Diego. She was 44 years old.
        Dr. Dempsey died of a heart attack, a spokeswoman for the family said.
        She joined the university faculty in 1980, a year before she received a doctorate in English from Harvard University. Previously, she had taught English at Harvard, at Boston University and at Vassar College.
        A native of Mineola, L.I., she was a graduate of Newton College of the Sacred Heart in Newton, Mass., where she won a two-year scholarship to Sophia University in Tokyo. She also studied at the British Museum and Warburg Institute in London and at the American Academy in Rome.
        Dr. Dempsey is survived by her parents, William H. and Frances Dempsey of Mineola, and a brother, William J. Jr., of Westbury, L.I.
