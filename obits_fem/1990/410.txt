        Edith Schaffer Phillips, a former official of the American Broadcasting Company, died on Friday at her home in Lake Worth, Fla. She was 82 years old.
        She had suffered from Parkinson's disease for more than three years, said her son, Jonathan, of Manhattan.
        Mrs. Phillips was one of few women working in corporate law when she began her legal career, all of which was spent working for ABC and its predecessor, Paramount Pictures. Among her associates were Adolph Zucker, Charles deHilles and Stanton Griffith.
        When Paramount Pictures lost its subsidiaries in antitrust actions, Mrs. Schaffer joined what was to become ABC. She was an officer of ABC, as well as an officer and director of several of its subsidiaries, including ABC Films, Paramount Records and Westminster Records. She retired in 1967.
        She was a native New Yorker and a 1930 graduate of St. John's Law School.
        In addition to her son, she is survived by her husband, D. John Phillips; a daughter, Lynn Raglione of Manhattan, and two brothers, Al and Irving, both of Sarasota. Fla.
