        Toni Greenberg, a philanthropist and arts administrator, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 65 years old.
        She died of cancer, her family said.
        Mrs. Greenberg was president of New York Pro Musica and was the widow of Noah Greenberg, founder and musical director of the early-music ensemble, who died in 1966. She served as assistant to the president of the Mannes College of Music from 1966 to 1970 and was acting director of the New York University Institute for the Humanities in the late 1970's.
        She was born in Danzig, then a free city on the Baltic and now Gdansk, Poland, and received a bachelor's degree from New York University and a master's degree in library science from Columbia.
        Long interested in the study of Judaism, she made gifts for that purpose to several institutions, including Hebrew University in Jerusalem, of which she was a governor; the New York Public Library, Yale and Skidmore College, where she was a trustee.
        She is survived by two daughters, Anne Donovan of London and Jane Ernst of Saratoga Springs, N.Y., and four grandsons.
