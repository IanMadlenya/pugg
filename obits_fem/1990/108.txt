        Correction:  March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Late Edition - Final
        An obituary yesterday about Terry Quimby, a former advertising executive in the fashion industry, misidentified a surviving daughter. She is Elizabeth Timberman, not Pimberman. The obituary also misstated the day of her death. It was Saturday, not Friday.
