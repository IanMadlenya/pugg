        She died of lung cancer, said a daughter, Katherine Knapp of Stamford, Conn.
        Mrs. Falise retired as an assistant vice president at the Bank of New York in 1984 because of ill health. Earlier she had worked as a securities analyst at Kidder Peabody & Company and as a stockbroker at Laird, Bissell & Meeds.
        She was a graduate of Smith College and did graduate work in business administration at Baruch College of the City University of New York.
        She is survived by another daughter, Christina Sumner Knapp of Manhattan; her stepmother, Janet McNeir Prentice of Belleair, Fla., and a sister, Barbara Kulesh of Pendleton, S.C.
