        Dorothy James Roberts, a writer best known for her retelling of ancient Arthurian, Irish and Icelandic myths in historical romances, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Palo Alto, Calif. She was 96 and lived in Palo Alto.
        Miss Roberts, the daughter of a West Virginia oil producer, was the author of 14 books, the most popular of which was ''The Enchanted Cup,'' based on Malory's version of the legend of Tristan and Isolde. It was a Book of the Month Club selection in 1953.
        Among her books acclaimed by critics was ''Fire in the Ice,'' based on the Icelandic Njal's Saga and described by Orville Prescott in The New York Times in 1961 as ''somber and splendid.'' The reviewer wrote that Miss Roberts ''imposed order on the disorderly mass of saga material'' by telling the legend from the point of view of one key character, Hallgerda Hoskuldsdottir, and eliminating ''many irrelevant scenes, superflouous characters and tiresome genealogical pedigrees.''
        Among her other works were ''Launcelot, My Brother,'' ''A Durable Fire,'' ''Kinsmen of the Grail,'' ''With Night We Banish Sorrow,'' ''A Man of Malice Landing,'' ''Return of the Stranger,'' and ''Mountain Journey,'' all published before her retirement in 1964.
        Miss Roberts is survived by a twin sister, Anna Craine of Denver, and a nephew, Jim Craine of Sacramento, Calif.
