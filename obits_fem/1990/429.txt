        Nan Wood Graham, the model for the tight-lipped farm woman in the painting "American Gothic," died Friday in a nursing home in Menlo Park, Calif. She was 91 years old.
        The 1930 painting by her brother Grant Wood, the regionalist artist, portrays a somber farmer bearing a pitchfork and his equally somber daughter standing before a cottage in Eldon in southeast Iowa. The model for the farmer was Dr. Byron McKeeby, a dentist who lived in the Woods' hometown of Anamosa, Iowa.
        The painting initially provoked complaints in Cedar Rapids, where some women protested that Mrs. Graham was poking fun at them with her dour depiction of an Iowa farm woman. One woman wrote to say Mrs. Graham's face would "sour milk."
        But the painting, and Mrs. Graham, eventually gained wide popularity in her home state.
        If her brother had gone through with his original intention of using another model, the secretarial school graduate said she would have whiled away her days as "the world's worst stenographer."
        "Grant made a personality out of me," she once said. "I would have had a very drab life without it."
        She was protective of "American Gothic," bringing suit several times against the frequent caricatures and parodies. The painting is kept at the Art Institute of Chicago. Her brother died in 1942.
        Born in Anamosa, she attended Polk School and Washington High School in Cedar Rapids. In 1924, she married a real estate investor, Edward Graham. The couple settled in Riverside, Calif., and had no children.
        In 1984, widowed and going blind, Mrs. Graham entered a Menlo Park nursing home, ending a lifetime job as historian of her brother's work.
