        Miss Guilford, who was named Nanette Gutman at her birth on Aug. 17, 1903, in New York City, was one of the first American singers to establish an operatic career without going to Europe for training or for early performance opportunities. She studied privately with Albert Jeannotte and began her career in the musical theater, in ''The Midnight Rounders of 1921'' at the Century Promenade.
        In May 1923, when she signed her first contract with the Metropolitan Opera, she gave her age as 18 and was said to be the youngest singer ever signed by the company. During her career, she was called ''the baby star'' of the company.
        Miss Guilford made her debut in a minor role in a production of ''Rigoletto'' and sang small roles until March 20, 1926, when she appeared as Ginevra in ''La Cena Delle Beffe'' by Giordano. Her other Met roles included Aida, Liu in ''Turandot'' and Musetta in ''La Boheme. She appeared in early Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts, and in the late 1920's she made several Vitaphone sound films. She also made recordings with the violinist Max Rosen, whom she married in 1928 and divorced in 1930.
        She taught voice privately until 1981, and in recent years she gave master classes at C. W. Post College and Long Island University.
        There are no survivors.
