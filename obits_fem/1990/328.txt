        Lida Brodenova, a singer, producer and teacher of Czechoslovak opera, died on Monday at George Washington University Hospital in Washington. She was 88 years old. Mrs. Brodenova died of a stroke, the hospital said. Since moving from New York to the Washington area in 1954, she staged performances of 17 operas, 12 of them Czechoslovak. Most were produced on low budgets and presented in high school and college auditoriums.
        Among her productions were Smetana's ''Bartered Bride,'' ''The Kiss'' and ''Two Widows,'' and the folk opera ''Rusalka'' by Dvorak.
        Mrs. Brodenova came to the United States in 1940 and settled in New York with her husband, Boris Brodenov. She sang in opera here and organized benefit performances for war refugees.
        Her husband died in 1960. There are no immediate survivors.
