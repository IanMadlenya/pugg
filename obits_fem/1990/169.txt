        Emily Remler, a jazz guitarist in the be-bop tradition, died of a heart attack on Friday while on tour in Sydney, Australia, the Associated Press reported yesterday. She was 32 years old.
        Ms. Remler was born in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., and started playing folk and then rock guitar. It was not until she became a student at the Berklee College of Music in Boston that she was exposed to the jazz guitar of Charlie Christian and Wes Montgomery. After graduating from Berklee in 1976, she moved to New Orleans and performed with jazz and pop groups, including the house band at the Fairmount Hotel.
        When the guitarist Herb Ellis was passing through New Orleans in 1977, he heard Ms. Remler play, and he soon invited her to perform at the Concord Jazz Festival in California, where she shared the stage with Mr. Ellis and other leading guitarists - Tal Farlow, Charlie Byrd and Barney Kessel.
        She moved to New York in 1978 and built a reputation by working with singers, including Nancy Wilson and Astrud Gilberto, and leading her own groups. Beginning with the 1982 album ''Firefly'' for Concord Records, she released seven albums. In 1985 Downbeat magazine's annual International Critics Poll named her guitarist of the year.
