        Tamara De Treaux, the actress who played the role of the lovable alien in the Oscar-winning film "E.T., the Extra-Terrestrial," died on Wednesday.  She was 31 years old.
        Miss De Treaux died of respiratory and heart problems at the Medical Center of North Hollywood, said a friend, Ken Maley.
        The 31-inch-tall actress started her career in San Francisco theaters and joined a singing group called the Medflies in 1980. Steven Spielberg spotted her during a Medflies performance in Los Angeles and hired her to take on the role of the earthbound alien in "E.T." after the original actor was injured. Miss De Treaux played the creature in scenes that required movement, and a robot was used in close-ups.
        Miss De Treaux also appeared in the movies "Ghoulies" and in "Rockula." She recently completed filming "Love in Venice" and "The Linguine Incident."
        She is survived by her mother, Barbara Detro, a brother and a sister.
