        Marinka Gurewich, a voice teacher whose students included several prominent opera singers, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 88 years old.
        She died of heart failure, said her son-in-law, Dr. Edwin Gordon.
        Mrs. Gurewich was born in Bratislava, in what is now Czechoslovakia, in 1902. She studied voice and piano in Berlin. She gave recitals as a mezzo-soprano in Europe and in New York City after her arrival in 1940. In the 1960's and 70's, she was on the faculty of the Manhattan School of Music and the Mannes College of Music. She continued teaching privately after her retirement.
        Mrs. Gurewich's best-known students include the sopranos Martina Arroyo, Florence Quivar, Grace Bumbry, Sharon Sweet and Diana Soviero.
        She is survived by a son, Dr. Victor Gurewich of Cambridge, Mass.; a daughter, Anne Gordon of Indianapolis, and six grandchildren.
