        Dame Eva Turner, a dramatic soprano of extraordinary range and power and later a voice teacher, has died. She was 98.
        Miss Turner, who broke a hip three months ago, died on Saturday at Devonshire Hospital in London, said Katherine Morgan, a relative.
        Miss Turner was one of the first British sopranos to achieve stardom in Europe. She was born on March 10, 1892, in Oldham, Lancashire, and joined the Royal Carl Rosa Opera Company in London in 1916. She made her debut a year later as a page in Wagner's ''Tannhauser'' and rapidly took on lead roles in ''Tosca,'' ''Aida'' and ''Madama Butterfly.''
        She made her debut at La Scala in Milan in 1924 as Freia in Wagner's ''Rheingold.''
        From 1950 to 1959, she was a professor of voice at the University of Oklahoma. She then returned to London and was a professor of voice at the Royal Academy of Music until 1966. She continued to coach until recently.
        In 1962, she was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire.
        Miss Turner never married and left no immediate survivors.
