        Dorothea Bennett, a geneticist and educator known for her work in early mammalian development, died Thursday at the M. D. Anderson Hospital in Houston. She was 60 years old and lived in Austin, Tex.
        Dr. Bennett died of lymphoma, a colleague at the University of Texas, Dr. Karen Artzt, said.
        Dr. Bennett was the Alfred W. Roark Centennial Professor at the university, a post she resigned shortly before her death. Her early scientific contributions were made in mammalian embryology in association with L. D. Dunn, a noted geneticist.
        Between 1962 and 1976 she achieved international recognition for her research in the genetics of early mammalian development and the first definition of mammalian sperm surface structures, which were thought to control sperm development and fertilization.
        In 1976 she joined the staff of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research in Manhattan, where she did research and taught at the doctoral level. In 1986 she moved to the University of Texas, where she became chairman of the zoology department.
        Dr. Bennett served on several peer review committees for the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation in Washington.
        She was born on Oahu, Hawaii, and graduated from Barnard College. She received a doctorate from Columbia University.
        There are no immediate survivors.
