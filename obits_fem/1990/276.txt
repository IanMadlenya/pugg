        Eva Sully Block, who in the 1930's was a headline vaudeville performer at the Palace Theater and other stages, died on Tuesday at Tisch Hospital in Manhattan. She was 88 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She died of cardiovascular collapse, said a spokesman for the Friars Club, where Mrs. Block was an honorary member.
        Mrs. Block, who with her late husband, Jesse, played the vaudeville circuit as Block and Sully, appeared with Eddie Cantor in ''Kid Millions'' and was a star on ''The Eddie Cantor Show'' and the ''Chase and Sanborn Radio Hour.'' The team of Block and Sully was among the last to play the vaudeville circuit at the Loew's Theaters before they ceased to have live shows.
        She is survived by a sister, Katherine Berke of Manhattan.
