        Sari Biro, a Hungarian pianist who settled in the United States in 1939, died at St. Mary's Hospital in San Francisco on Sunday. She was 78 years old and lived in San Francisco.
        Her daughter, Maria Warren Watts, said Miss Biro died of pneumonia.
        Miss Biro was born in Budapest on March 24, 1912, and studied at the Franz Liszt Royal Academy of Music. When she was 11 years old, she performed on the program that inaugurated the Hungarian Broadcasting System. Radio and television later played an important part in her career. In the 1950's, she performed a series of 13 live radio recitals in New York, as well as nine televised recitals that were broadcast on educational television in San Francisco. She also made several recordings on the Remington label. In the 1980's, she frequently returned to Hungary to record programs for radio broadcasts.
        Miss Biro gave her New York City debut recital in November 1940 at Town Hall. Reviewing the performance in The New York Times, Noel Strauss admired her "ability to set forth lyric passages with exceptional beauty of singing tone and a haunting expressiveness."
        She toured the United States as a recitalist and concerto soloist, and in 1949 she played nine concertos in a three-concert series at Carnegie Hall. Besides standard repertory works, the series included the New York premiere of Darius Milhaud's Second Piano Concerto. She moved to San Francisco in 1958 and made her last New York appearance in 1972.
        She is survived by her daughter and a granddaughter, Fiora Sari Watts of San Francisco.
