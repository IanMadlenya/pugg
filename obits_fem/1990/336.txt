        Mrs. Tupper died of cancer, said her daughter, Rettadel Tupper, of Queens.
        Mrs. Tupper, a native of Marblehead, Ohio, began her career playing piano in a small jazz band she organized with her brother, Jack Clemens, who played guitar. After appearing in vaudeville and on local radio shows, they came to New York and appeared on radio here, where Mrs. Tupper was also known as a singer. Their first big hit was as a wise-cracking couple in ''The Gibson Family,'' an early radio series. Jack Clemens died in 1970. For several years, Mrs. Tupper appeared regularly on ''Sesame Street'' as ''Mrs. Trump,'' playing the piano. Mrs. Tupper's husband, Frederick, a musician, died in 1975.  In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a grandson.
