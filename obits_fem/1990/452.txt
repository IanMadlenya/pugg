        Carol D. Shryock, a trustee of Hastings Village, N.Y., died on Sunday at Montefiore Hospital. She was 49 years old and lived in Hastings.
        Mrs. Shryock died of cancer, a family spokeswoman said.
        She was serving her fifth term as a trustee and was involved in two village projects: the development of the Newington Cropsey Museum and the acquisition of Draper Park. She was a member of the St. Matthew's Church Group of the Homeless Consortium and of the Hastings League of Women Voters.
        Mrs. Shryock had been public relations director for Phelps Memorial Hospital in North Tarrytown from 1989 until October of this year. From 1983 to 1989, she was public-relations manager for Graham-Windham Services to Family and Children in Hastings.
        She is survived by her husband, Ralph; a sister, Joan Allard of Albany, and a son, Stephen, of Hastings.
