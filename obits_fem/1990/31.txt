        Trude Fleischmann, a portrait photographer known in her native Vienna as the Photographer of the Famous, died on Saturday at the home of her nephew in Brewster, N.Y. She was 94 years old.
        Two years ago Ms. Fleischmann broke one leg in a fall at her home in Lugano, Switzerland, then broke the other in a fall in the hospital. When she left the hospital, her nephew, Stefan Carrell, brought her to the United States.
        Photographs by Ms. Fleischmann are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, George Eastman House in Rochester and the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif. Among her subjects were Hedy Lamarr, Arturo Toscanini, Eleanor Roosevelt, Raymond Massey, Albert Einstein, Sinclair Lewis, Paul Robeson, Gian Carlo Menotti and Conrad Veidt.
        Ms. Fleischmann, who lived and worked in Vienna, London and New York, never received the attention accorded some portraitists. The first exhibition to bring her prominence in the United States was in San Francisco in 1981. Her agent, Dorothy Garfein, said Ms. Fleischmann ''never promoted herself'' and regarded herself as a photographer and not as an artist. By the 1960's, when photography began to receive widespread acceptance as art, Ms. Fleischmann had retired and moved to Lugano.
        She studied art history in Paris and began her career as an apprentice in a Viennese portrait studio. A few years ago Ms. Garfein catalogued more than 4,000 negatives made after the photographer came to the United States. Before leaving Austria in the late 1930's, she destroyed virtually all the negatives she had made.
        She is survived by her nephew.
