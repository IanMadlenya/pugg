        Dorsha Hayes, a dancer and writer, died Tuesday at Doctors Hospital in Manhattan. She was 93 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She died of complications after a stroke, said Richard N. Bentley, a cousin.
        Born in Galesburg, Ill., Mrs. Hayes, whose name was originally Doris Bentley, made her debut as a dancer in 1912 in "The Daughter of Heaven," a spectacle based on a novel by Pierre Loti. A student of Ruth St. Denis, she also appeared with the Fokine Ballet and with Fred and Adele Astaire in "The Passing Show of 1918." In 1924, she and her husband, Paul Hayes, who died in 1969, founded the Theater of the Dance, whose productions combined dance and music with poetry by such authors as T. S. Eliot and William Butler Yeats.
        After an attack of rheumatic fever ended her performing career in 1936, Mrs. Hayes became a writer, publishing poetry in literary magazines, articles on Jungian psychology and several novels, including "Mrs. Heaton's Daughter" (1943) and "Who Walk the Earth" (1945). She also wrote "The American Primer" (1941), a study of American democracy, and "Chicago, Crossroads of American Enterprise" (1944), a history.
        There are no immediate survivors. A memorial service will be held on Tuesday at 11 A.M. at Holy Trinity Church, 316 East 88th Street.
