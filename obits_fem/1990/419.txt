        Miriam Stern, an agent for songwriters and a former executive director of the American Guild of Authors and Composers, died on Sunday at Doctors Hospital. She was 76 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She died of pancreatic cancer, said Lynnae Crawford, of the Songwriters Guild of America.
        When Miss Stern resigned in 1969 as executive director of the American Guild of Authors and Composers, now known as the Songwriters Guild of America, she had been associated with the organization for 22 years.
        Before joining the guild, Ms. Stern worked for six years as road manager for the band leader Sammy Kaye.
        In the summer of 1970, Miss Stern formed a corporation to represent estates of composers whose reversionary rights had been disregarded by the British Music Publishers Association. The test actions she organized resulted in a decision by the House of Lords to establish such rights as stated in a 1911 statute that she was instrumental in uncovering.
        Miss Stern is survived by a niece, Susan Klein.
