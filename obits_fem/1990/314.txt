        Mrs. Deutscher, born in Poland, escaped to England at the outbreak of World War II. As Tamara Lebenhaft, she was secretary to an expatriate organization of Polish journalists in London when she and Mr. Deutscher were married in 1947. She collaborated with him on his biographies of Stalin and Trotsky and, after his death in 1967, she edited collections of her husband's writings.
        Mrs. Deutscher wrote a study of her own, ''The Other Lenin,'' published in 1973, and later assisted the historian E. H. Carr in preparing the last volumes of his history of the Soviet Union.
        She is survived by a son, Martin, of London.
