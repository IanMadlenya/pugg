        Mrs. Gruver twice came close to winning a world title. In 1966 in Amsterdam, playing with Sue Sachs of Baltimore, she finished second in the World Women's Pair Championship.

        Mrs. Gruver, a bridge administrator, served as a member of the National Laws Commission of the American Contract Bridge League and as co-chairman of the national appeals committee, ruling on tournament disputes.
        She is survived by her husband, John A. Gruver; a daughter, Cynthia Gruver-Williams of Carroll County, Md., and a son, John Gordon Gruver of College Park, Md.
