        Elizabeth Walker, a tax lawyer, died yesterday at Norwalk Hospital in Connecticut. She was 81 years old and lived in Pound Ridge, N.Y.
        She died of acute diverticulitis, a spokeswoman for the family said.
        Miss Walker was in private practice in Pound Ridge from the late 1930's until she retired in 1985.
        She was active in alumni affairs at Wellesley College and at Dartmouth College, her late brother's alma mater, and she raised funds for both institutions.
        She was born in Manhattan and was a graduate of Horace Mann in 1927, and Wellesley in 1933. She graduated from Columbia Law School in 1936 and from Columbia Business School, where she received a master's degree in public accounting, in 1939.
        There are no immediate survivors.
