        Elenore Lester, a writer, editor and teacher, died Sunday at New York Hospital. She was 69 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She died of lymphoma, said Roslyn Regelson, her companion of many years.
        Ms. Lester, a freelance writer, wrote extensively on the arts. In such publications as The Village Voice, The New Republic and The New York Times, she helped document the emergence of the Off Off Broadway theater.
        Her 1980 article for The New York Times Magazine on Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat who saved hundreds of Hungarian Jews from the Nazis in the 1940's and who later disappeared behind the Iron Curtain, led to a book, ''Raoul Wallenberg: The Man in the Iron Web.''
        Ms. Lester, a graduate of Hunter College and New York University, taught at City College, Jersey City State College and New York University. In 1973, she joined the newspaper Jewish Week as arts editor, a position she held at the time of her death.
        She is survived by her husband, Jean Isenberg of Chico, Calif., and two brothers, Paul Hochstein of Los Angeles and Robert Hochstein of Washington.
