        Mary Kirk, a jazz pianist, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90 years old.
        Margery Elliott, a family friend, said her death was caused by complications of pulmonary cancer.
        Mary Colston Kirk, a native of Denver, was a pupil there of Paul Whiteman's father. She later worked in Denver in George Morrison's dance band, where she met her husband, the band-leader Andrew Dewey (Andy) Kirk. He later led the famed Dark Clouds of Joy.
        In Kansas City, her ensemble, the Mary Kirk Trio, included Paul Gunther, drummer, and Charlie Parker, saxophonist, in his first professional job.
        After coming to New York with her husband, Mrs. Kirk taught music for many years.
        In addition to her husband, she is survived by a sister, Bernice Brown of New York.
