        Kathleen McLaughlin, a newspaper reporter for 44 years who won recognition as a political correspondent in the 1940's and 50's, died on Friday at a nursing home in Park Ridge, Ill. She was 92 years old.
        During a 33-year career with The New York Times, she was the newspaper's women's editor, a member of the Washington bureau and a foreign correspondent in Bonn. She covered the Nuremberg trials before writing about the United Nations and switching to business news until her retirement in 1968.
        After arriving in Washington during the Roosevelt years, she became one of the small inner circle of women reporters covering the activities of Eleanor Roosevelt. At the United Nations, she won the trust of many diplomats and became known for perceptive writing about emerging third-world countries.
        Her newspaper career began at The Daily Globe in Atchison, Kan., in 1924. She was the recipient of many awards, including three from the New York Newspaper Women's Club.
        She is survived by a brother, Thomas, and 10 nieces and nephews.
