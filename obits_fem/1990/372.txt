        A. Louise Brush, a retired psychiatrist, died on Tuesday at Greenwich Hospital in Connecticut. She was 79 years old and lived in Greenwich.
        Dr. Brush died of pneumonia, her sister, Ruth Seaman Brush of Boston, said.
        A life fellow of the American Psychiatric Association, Dr. Brush was associated with Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center from 1937 to 1958 as a teacher and psychiatric researcher.
        From 1936 to 1965 she was an instructor in psychiatry at Cornell Medical School. In 1950, she became a consulting psychiatrist at Barnard College. She also maintained private practices in Manhattan and Greenwich until she retired in 1979.
        Dr. Brush was a graduate of Barnard. She received her medical degree from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and practiced psychiatry at the Austen Fox Riggs Foundation in Stockbridge, Mass., now the Austen Fox Center. She later did postgraduate work at the Columbia University Neurological Institute.
        Her husband, John Alexander Frank, an architect, died earlier this month.
        Her sister is her only survivor.
