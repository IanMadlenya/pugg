        Mrs. Scales, a member of the class of 1901 at Smith, was the college's first dean of students, a position known as warden, from 1922 until her retirement in 1944.
        Before taking the job at Smith she was an instructor at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and dean of women at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh.
        She received an honorary doctorate of humane letters from Smith in 1931 and an honorary doctorate of literature from Dartmouth College in 1939.
        Her closest survivors are three nieces.
