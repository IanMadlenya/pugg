        Lilian Thomson Mowrer, author of books about Europe on the eve of World War II, died Sunday at her home in Chicago. She was 101 years old.
        With her husband, Edgar Ansel Mowrer, a Pulitizer Prize-winning foreign correspondent for The Chicago Daily News, Mrs. Mowrer was close to events in Italy during the rise of Mussolini, in Germany during the rise of Hitler and in France until it fell to the Nazis in 1940.
        She and Mr. Mowrer, who won his Pulitzer in 1933, were forced by the Nazis to leave Germany the same year. He died in 1977.
        Mrs. Mowrer's first book, ''Journalist's Wife,'' appeared in 1937 and was promptly banned in Germany by the Nazis. Her last book, published in 1961, was ''The Indomitable John Scott: Citizen of Long Island,'' a biography of a 17th-century Colonial adventurer.
        Mrs. Mowrer, who was born in England and met her husband there in 1911, also wrote theater criticism and articles on politics for such publications as Vanity Fair and Town and Country and for British newspapers.
        She is survived by her daughter, Diana M. Beliard, of Chicago, and a granddaughter.
