        Princess Safiyeh Firouz, a member of the Iranian royal family deposed in the 1920's, died of a heart attack on Tuesday. She was 87 years old and lived here in exile.
        She was the widow of Prince Mozaffar Firouz, whose grandfather, King Mozaffar ud-Din Shah of the Qajar dynasty, was overthrown by the father of the late Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi in 1925. Prince Firouz died in 1983.
        Princess Firouz was an early advocate of women's rights. She led a march on the Iranian Parliament for women's suffrage in the 1940's and opposed wearing the chador. In 1943, she founded the Council of Women in Iran. She is survived by two sons, Eskander and Narcy, and five grandchildren.
        Correction:  March 29, 1990, Thursday, Late Edition - Final
        Because of an editing error, an obituary last Thursday about Princess Safiyeh Firouz, a member of a deposed Iranian royal family, misidentified her late husband. He was Prince Mohammed Hussein Mirza Firouz. The article also misstated the historical role of her husband's grandfather, Mozaffar ud-Din Shah.
        He was an earlier ruler, not the one who was overthrown in the 1920's.
