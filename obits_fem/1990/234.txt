        Peggy Glanville-Hicks, an Australian-born composer who lived in the United States between 1942 and 1959, died on Monday in St. Vincent's Hospital in Sydney. She was 77 years old and died of a heart attack, said James Murdoch, the executor of her estate.
        Miss Glanville-Hicks enjoyed her greatest activity and success in the United States, and became a citizen in 1948. Her best-known scores were operas - ''The Transposed Heads'' (1954), based on Thomas Mann's novella; ''Nausicaa'' (1961), with a libretto by Robert Graves, and ''Sappho'' (1961), commissioned by the San Francisco Opera.
        She was also a music critic at The New York Herald-Tribune between 1948 and 1958, joining the paper as part of Virgil Thomson's group of composer-critics. In 1949 she composed ''Thomsoniana,'' consisting of vocal settings of excerpts from Mr. Thomson's reviews.
        Interest in Non-Western Music
        Miss Glanville-Hicks was born in Melbourne in 1912. She was educated there and studied in London (with Ralph Vaughan Williams), Vienna (with Egon Wellesz) and Paris (with Nadia Boulanger). In New York, she was active in composers' organizations and in the performance and promotion of new music.
        Her own compositional style revealed a growing interest in non-Western music. ''The Transposed Heads'' attempted an early reconciliation between Western and Hindu music. Living in Athens between 1959 and 1976, she investigated ancient Greek music as well as Far Eastern folkloric styles.
        Her composing career was curtailed after brain surgery in 1966. Upon her return to Australia in 1975, she directed the Asian Music Studies Program at the Australian Music Center in Sydney. In 1987, the University of Sydney awarded her an honorary doctorate in music.
        She is survived by a brother, Beric Glanville-Hicks.
        Funeral services were held Friday at Christ Church in St. Lawrence, Queensland, Australia.
