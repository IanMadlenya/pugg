        She died of complications from an aneurysm, a friend said.
        Dr. Brown, who earned a Ph.D. in social anthropology from Yale in 1929, joined the Russell Sage Foundation in Manhattan in 1930 as a research associate and at her retirement in 1963 was its director of executive program planning.
        In 1948, her book ''Nursing for the Future'' recommended that professional schools of nursing be established at universities and that clinical nursing specialties be developed. She also wrote books on patient care and was internationally known as a lecturer and consultant. She was an honorary life member of the National League for Nursing. Her books also included: ''Social Work as a Profession,'' ''Lawyers, Law Schools and the Public Service,'' and ''From Custodial to Therapeutic Patient Care in Mental Hospitals.'' She had also taught at the universities of New Hampshire and Wisconsin at Madison.
        She is survived by a cousin.
