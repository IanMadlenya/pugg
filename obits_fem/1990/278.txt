        Mrs. Korey died of a heart attack during dinner, said her business partner, Allen Kay.
        Mrs. Korey began the firm with Mr. Kay in 1982. Its clients include Virgin Atlantic Airways and Members Only, a clothing manufacturer that was among the first to devote part of its advertising to an anti-drug campaign.
        Mrs. Korey, a native New Yorker, began her career as a television writer specializing in comedy, writing for Ernie Kovacs, George Gobel and Woody Allen. She met Mr. Kay in 1969 when both were working for McCann Erickson, a Manhattan advertising agency. Together they handled the advertising campaign for Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller's campaign for re-election in 1970 for the Jack Tinker & Partners advertising agency.
        She is survived by a son, Christopher, of Los Angeles, and a daughter, Susan, of Manhattan.
