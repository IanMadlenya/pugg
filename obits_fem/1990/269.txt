        Mildred Scott Olmsted, a longtime antiwar campaigner who was national executive director of a leading pro-disarmament group, died Monday at her home in Rose Valley, Pa., a suburb of Philadelphia. She was 99 years old.
        She died of heart failure, said Ann Ivey, a colleague.
        For 20 years, starting in 1946, Mrs. Olmsted led the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, formed at The Hague in 1915. She was also active in the women's suffrage movement from the early 1900's, and later in life became active in the civil rights movement.
        In 1961 she began a series of exchange seminars between the United States section of the league and the Women's Committee of the Soviet Union, a group sponsored by the Soviet Government.
        Two months ago Mrs. Olmsted received a lifetime achievement award from the City of Philadelphia, and in 1986 she received the women's league's Peace and Freedom Award.
        She was born in Glenolden, Pa., and graduated from Smith College in 1912. In World War I she was a social worker with the Y.W.C.A. in France and Germany. In France she met Jane Addams, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize and first president of the women's league, whose example inspired Mrs. Olmsted to work for peace.
        Her husband, Allen Olmsted, a Pennsylvania judge who was a founder of the American Civil Liberties Union, died in 1976.
        Mrs. Olmsted is survived by a son, Anthony, of West Goshen, Pa.; a daughter, Enid Burke, of Springfield, Mass.; eight grandchildren, and two great- grandchildren.
