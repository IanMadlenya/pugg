       Jane Stewart Mapes, a retired public relations executive, died on Friday at her home in Litchfield Park, Ariz. She was 73 years old and lived in Litchfield Park.
        A spokesman for the family said that the death was listed as a suicide. She had been ill for some time with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease.
        She and her husband, John G. Mapes, who died last year, founded an opinion research company, the Group Attitudes Corporation, in 1950. They joined Hill & Knowlton Inc. when their company was acquired in 1956. She served as president of Group Attitudes before and after it became a subsidary of Hill & Knowlton.
        Mrs. Mapes, a graduate of Ohio Wesleyan University, was named by Printer's Ink in 1966 as one of America's 40 top women in executive positions in communications and marketing. She retired from Hill & Knowlton in 1968.
        She is survived by a sister, Ruth S. Stoltz of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., and a stepson, Glynn D. Mapes of London.
