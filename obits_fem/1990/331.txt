        She had been ill for several months and died of respiratory failure, the organization said.
        Miss Simmons spent more than 35 years with the N.A.A.C.P. Before coming to Washington, she held posts as national education director, national training director, director of special voter registration drives and associate director of branch and field services.
        She successfully lobbied for the extension of the Voting Rights Act in 1982, the creation of a holiday honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., sanctions against South Africa and the subsequent Congressional override of President Ronald Reagan's veto. Miss Simmons was the recipient of many national awards and honors.
        Survivors include a sister, Earldean V. S. Robbins of San Francisco.
