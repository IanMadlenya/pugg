        She died of complications from pneumonia, a family friend said.
        Mrs. Andrews, who was born in Pittsfield, became interested in the Shakers, a celibate communal Christian order, in 1923 when she and her husband, Edward Deming Andrews, visited the Shaker community in Hancock, Mass.
        In the succeeding years, they wrote nine books and numerous articles and pamphlets on the sect. They also gathered a large collection of Shaker furniture, part of which they later donated to Yale University, where Mr. Andrews had been a graduate student. Mr. Andrews died in 1964.
        Mrs. Andrews's survivors include a daughter, Ann E. Kane of Stanford, Calif., and five grandchildren.
