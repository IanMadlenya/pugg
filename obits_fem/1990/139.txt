        Funeral services for Greta Garbo, who died on Sunday at New York Hospital at the age of 84, were conducted in private yesterday at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home in Manhattan.
        The funeral parlor, like the hospital, refused to provide any additional information at the request of the actress's family. Garbo spent the last 49 years of her life jealously guarding her privacy.
        Garbo may be buried in a family grave in Stockholm, the Swedish newspaper Expressen reported yesterday. The newspaper quoted Garbo's niece, Grae Reisfeld of Passaic, N.J., her only surviving relative, as saying it was her aunt's wish to be buried in Sweden.
        Expressen quoted Ms. Reisfeld as saying the cause of death was cardiac arrest.
