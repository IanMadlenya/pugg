        Mrs. Witkin was one of the first women to work in the electronic music idiom. Born in New York City, she studied with such noted composers as Roger Sessions and Stefan Wolpe, and with the pianist Edward Steuerman. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees in music from Hunter College and New York University.
        In 1963 she helped establish the Contemporary Chamber Ensemble, a performing group that commissioned new works. She was a guest composer of the McDowell Colony as well as a longtime member of the Women's Composers Forum and the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers.
        She is survived by her husband, Louis; a daughter, Judy Sandegren, of New Canaan, Conn.; a son, Steve R. Witkin, of Waterville, Me.; a brother, Melvin Braverman; a sister, Isabelle Kistenberg, and three grandchildren.
