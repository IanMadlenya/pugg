        Mrs. Greene, widow of the late William D. Greene, a communications lawyer, was president of the club when it closed in 1979 after the city withdrew its exemption from property taxes.
        She was a volunteer at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital for 25 years and was co-chairman of its Ball of the Roses and theater benefits for many years. She was also chairman of theater benefits for The Soldiers', Sailors' and Airmen's Club Inc., and served as its treasurer.
        She is survived by two daughters, Ellen, of San Francisco, and Sarah, of Manhattan.
