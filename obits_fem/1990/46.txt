        Louella Luhrman, an Army nurse in World War I who became the nation's oldest veteran, died Friday. She was 108 years old.
        Miss Luhrman, who joined the Army in 1918, when she was 36, spent her military service at Camp Lewis, Wash., and was discharged in 1919.
        She was born in Germany on Dec. 8, 1881, and immigrated to the United States with her family two years later, crossing the Atlantic in a sailing ship.
        Miss Luhrman became the nation's oldest veteran in 1987 when Jasper Garrison of Illinois, who had served in the Spanish-American War, died at the age of 107.
