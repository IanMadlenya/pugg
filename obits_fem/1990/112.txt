        Geneva Mathiasen, former executive director of the National Council on Aging, died of heart failure on Tuesday at a nursing home in Suffern, N.Y. She was 91 years old and lived in Tuxedo, N.Y.
        Mrs. Mathiasen was one of the delegates to the first White House Conference on the Aging in 1950. She was appointed executive secretary of the newly formed National Committee on the Aging, which was established to provide information and consultation services on the field of aging, with headquarters in New York City.
        In 1960, with help from a Ford Foundation grant, the national committee became the independent National Council on the Aging, with Mrs. Mathiasen as its first executive director. She retired in 1969.
        She then served a term as co-chairman of Gov. Hugh Carey's Task Force on Aging. Mrs. Mathiasen was also a board member of the Jewish Home and Hospital and a member of the Citzens' Committee on Aging for the Community Council of Greater New York.
        A widow, she is survived by a daughter, Mary Yrizarry of Brooklyn; a son, David G. of Washington, and two granddaughters.
