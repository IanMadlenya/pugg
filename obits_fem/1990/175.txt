        After Mr. James's death, Mrs. James and Mrs. Murray were partners in the restaurant, at 2017 Fifth Avenue. They sold it to Joseph Holland in 1988 but maintained close ties with it. Mrs. James was also a consultant to the Harlem Travel Bureau and a board member of the New York Chapter of the American Society of Travel Agents.
        Earlier in her career, she had worked for the Crocker National Bank in San Francisco as director of community relations, and for Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corporation of Mountain View, Calif., where she was responsible for hiring and training.
        She is survived by a sister, Virginia Farmer of the Bronx.
