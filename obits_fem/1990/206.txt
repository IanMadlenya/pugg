        Ruth M.

She was 78 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Miss Martin, who was born in Plattsburgh, N.Y., and received her nurse's training in Washington, was one of 15 American nurses who were rescued in the torpedoing of the Dutch liner Maasdam by a German submarine in the North Atlantic in June 1941.
        The nurses, and two others who were lost in the sinking, were on their way to serve in London under the auspices of the American Red Cross and the Harvard Medical School in the months before the United States entered World War II.
        The ship was abandoned north of Iceland on a rainy night. Miss Martin was among those who were rescued by a Norwegian tanker after drifting for seven days in a lifeboat.
        Later in the war she served in the American Embassy in London, and after the war she was assigned to embassies in Cairo and Teheran. She represented the Pathfinder Fund, an organization promoting birth control, in South America and in Africa before returning to the United States and the Nurses Association post. She retired in 1972.
        There are no immediate survivors.
