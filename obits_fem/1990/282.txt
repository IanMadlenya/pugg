        Her death resulted from cancer, a family spokesman said.
        Mrs. Lowenthal, whose husband is the pianist Jerome Lowenthal, was a native of Haifa, in what was then Palestine, and studied in Tel Aviv and in New York. She made her debut at the age of 16 with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra and later played concerts widely in western Europe and the United States.
        Surviving, besides her husband, are two daughters, Carmel and Leora, both of Manhattan, and a brother, Nahum Amir, a composer, of Tel Aviv.
