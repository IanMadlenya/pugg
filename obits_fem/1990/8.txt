        Juliet Berto, who starred in the Jean-Luc Godard films ''Weekend,'' ''La Chinoise'' and ''Le Gai Savoir,'' died of cancer on Wednesday. She was 42 years old.
        Made famous by ''Weekend,'' Mr. Godard's 1966 classic about a group of people taking to the roads to escape a riot-torn Paris, Miss Berto went on to play a major role in Alain Tanner's ''Middle of the World'' (1974), to play Celine in Jacques Rivette's ''Celine and Julie Go Boating'' (1974) and to co-star with Bulle Ogier in Mr. Rivette's ''Duelle'' in 1976. She then began to direct and had a success with her first effort, ''Neige'' (''Snow''), a 1981 docudrama about drug trafficking that she worked on with Jean-Henri Roger.
        She also co-starred with Alain Delon in 1976 in Joseph Losey's award-winning film ''Mr. Klein.''
