        Miss Crandall, a resident of Wiscasset, Me., had been in New York to cast roles for the Maine State Music Theater's coming season.
        Miss Crandall, a former concert pianist, in 1959 founded the Brunswick Summer Playhouse, which later became the Brunswick Music Theater. The name was changed again two years ago to the Maine State Music Theater, with Miss Crandall serving as executive director and artistic director.
        The theater, on the Bowdoin College campus, rejected packaged shows in favor of originally designed productions. Over the last three decades, Miss Crandall staged 186 productions with audiences totaling more than 1.5 million people.
        Born in Cleveland to Swedish immigrants, Miss Crandall was a graduate of the Eastman School of Music in Rochester. She went on to become a rehearsal pianist, working with performers like Ethel Merman and Jimmy Durante and with composers and lyricists like Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe.
        There are no immediate survivors.
