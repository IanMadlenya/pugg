        Barbara Creaturo, a senior editor at Cosmopolitan magazine, died on Saturday at Doctor's Hospital. She was 49 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Ms. Creaturo died of ovarian cancer, a spokeswoman for the magazine said.
        She was with the magazine for 22 years. She also worked at The New Yorker and Magazine Management. She began her career as a secondary school teacher at the Ramaz School, an independent yeshiva in Manhattan.
        Ms. Creaturo, a native New Yorker, graduated from Vassar College in 1962 and received an M.A. from Harvard University's Graduate School of Education. She recently completed "Ordeal: The Education of a Cancer Patient," scheduled for publication next spring by Pantheon Books.
        She is survived by her parents, Joseph and Ann Creaturo of St. Louis, and a brother, Anthony, of Maui, Hawaii. Her companion for many years was Hugh Harris.
