She was also the founding chairman of the women's club of the Fifth Avenue Synagogue.

She was a native of Union City, N.J., who grew up in Brooklyn and was graduated from Erasmus Hall High School.
        Her husband died in 1987. Surviving are two sons, Richard, of Atlantic Beach, L.I., and David, of Greenwich, Conn.; a daughter, Carole Friedman, of Atlantic Beach; nine grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
