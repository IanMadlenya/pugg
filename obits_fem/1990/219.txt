        A family spokesman said she died of a heart attack.
        She was a 40-year contributor to the Reader's Digest and wrote hundreds of articles about human relations, social problems, religion and the church.
        Her books included ''Meditations: Journey to the Self'' (Simon & Schuster, 1975), ''How to Be a Happy Woman'' (Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1952), and ''I'm Tired of Grandma'' (Bobbs-Merrill, 1946).
        She was born in Nova Scotia, attended Acadia College and taught in a one-room schoolhouse before her marriage to Owen Rumsey, a fellow teacher. The couple moved to New Britain, where Mr. Rumsey taught high school.
        She is survived by six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
