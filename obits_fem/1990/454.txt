        Simone Cousteau, who accompanied her husband, Jacques-Yves Cousteau, on hundreds of voyages aboard the research vessel Calypso, died on Sunday. She was 72 years old.
        Married in 1937, the Cousteaus for many years spent most of their time aboard the Calypso, sailing the world to study marine biology, conduct underwater explorations, make films and promote conservation.
        Mrs. Cousteau served as nurse and purser and sometimes took part in underwater missions.
        Survivors include her husband and a son, Jean-Michel.
