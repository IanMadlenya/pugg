       Nesha Bass Springer, the co-author of a 1978 guidebook on day care, died on Saturday at Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Newton, Mass. She was 60 years old and lived in Sunapee, N.H. She died of cancer, said her son Stephen.
        A graduate of Mount Holyoke College and Boston University, Mrs. Springer and her co-author, Beatrice Marden Glickman, wrote ''Who Cares for the Children?,'' published by Schocken Books. The book dealt with the pressures on young families that affect decisions about child care, as well as guidelines for choosing alternative care.
        She is survived by her husband, Robert; another son, Mark, of Westwood, Mass.; two daughters, Nancy Westendorf of Vienna, W.Va., and Carrie Streim of West Hartford, Conn; a sister, Mina Goldberg of Boston, and six grandchildren.
