        She died of colon cancer, relatives said.
        Dr. Shimrat, who was born in Poland, was a graduate of the Teachers Seminary in Jerusalem and the Shulamith Conservatory in Tel Aviv. She taught Hebrew and music in Israel before coming to the United States in 1957.
        After receiving a doctorate in education from Teachers College of Columbia University, Dr. Shimrat joined Mount Sinai in 1965 and later was in charge of child psychology in the center's Department of Psychiatry.
        Dr. Shimrat, who was fluent in several Slavonic languages, devoted much time in recent years to translating the recollections of Holocaust survivors for an extensive oral-history project.
        She is survived by four cousins, Tsipora Miron of Manhattan; Yehudit Har-Kedar of Neveh Monoson, Israel; Raquel Teitel of Washington, and Emanuel Men of Madrid.
