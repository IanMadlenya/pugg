        Charlotte Boschan, an economist who established the first electronic data bank in the field when she was associated with the National Bureau of Economic Research a quarter-century ago, died of complications of surgery on Thursday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 70 years old and lived in New City, N.Y.
        Dr. Boschan, who was born in Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany, received a bachelor's degree from New York University and a master's and a doctorate from Columbia University. After working at the Econometric Institute she joined the National Bureau in 1951 and was an early developer of data banks.
        At the bureau she helped revise the cyclical economic indicators used by the United States Department of Commerce and the procedure for combining the indicators into indexes of economic activity. She was also largely responsible for constructing the Growth Cycle Program, a method of determining turning points in the economy.
        From 1977 to 1986 Dr. Boschan was a vice president of Citibank, which took over the economic data bank, now known as Citibase, from the National Bureau.
        Her husband, Paul Boschan, a statistician, died in 1986.
        She is survived by a brother, Beretz Ronen of Kibbutz Hazorea, Israel.
