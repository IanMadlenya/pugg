        Edwina Dumm, a syndicated newspaper cartoonist, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 96 years old.
        Miss Dumm began her career in 1915 as an editorial cartoonist for The Columbus (Ohio) Monitor, which has since gone out of business. Lucy Caswell, of the Cartoon, Graphic and Photographic Arts Research Library of Ohio State University, said Miss Dumm was the first woman in the country to work full time as an editorial cartoonist.
        In 1917 Miss Dumm moved to Manhattan and continued her career under the name Edwina, with a comic strip called ''Cap. Stubbs.'' It was distributed by the George Matthew Adams Syndicate, which went out of business in the 1940's.
        ''Tippy,'' a dog, entered the strip in the 1930's, which was then distributed by King Features under both titles.
        Miss Dumm, a native of Upper Sandusky, Ohio, retired in 1966, and the comic strip ended.
        There are no immediate survivors.
