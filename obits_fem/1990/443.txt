        Clare Rostan Appel, founder with her husband of the Appel Farm Arts and Music Center near Elmer, N.J., died on Dec. 15 at her home on the farm. She was 66 years old.
        She died of breast cancer, said her husband, Albert D. Appel.
        The youth summer arts and farming camp the Appels founded in 1960 has evolved into a year-round cultural center. In addition to the summer camp, the nonprofit center in southern New Jersey offers extensive community and professional concert series and brings music and other cultural events to audiences throughout the state.
        Mrs. Appel was born in Limburg, Germany. Her father owned a textile and clothing factory that was taken over by the Nazis in 1938. Mrs. Appel came to the United States with her parents and older brother in 1940, first to New York City and a month later to a poultry farm in Vineland, New Jersey. She attended Glassboro College in N.J., where she earned a bachelor's degree in education in 1946.
        The Appels were married in 1947.They raised pigs, cattle and chickens and cultivated corn and small grains on Mr. Appel's 176-acre farm just outside Elmer. But their love for music -- he played violin, viola and cello, she played the piano -- and a desire to foster creativity eventually led them to use the farm for a youth summer camp that combines arts and farming, from jazz and drama to sheep shearing. The camp today attracts 180 youngsters up to 18 years old.
        In addition to her husband, Mrs. Appel is survived by two daughters, Judith Monroe of Elmer, N.J., and Aliza Morgan of Newark, Del.; two sons, Toby, of Manhattan and Julius, of Malaga, N.J., and six grandchildren.
