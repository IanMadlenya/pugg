        Nell Webster, an actress and art dealer, died of ovarian cancer on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 63 years old. Miss Webster was named Gloria Caroline Gall when she was born, in New York City. She changed her name when she became an actress. For a decade, she appeared at clubs throughout the United States in a one-woman comedy act she had developed.
        In 1968, Ms. Webster and two partners opened the Wright/Hepburn/ Webster Gallery in New York, which dealt exclusively in theatrical art and design. It mounted the first exhibition of contemporary Soviet theater, film, ballet and opera designs to be shown outside of the Soviet Union. The gallery later showed the work of a forger, David Stein, and was sued by the state's Attorney General to bar sales of his paintings, although the show was titled ''Forgeries by Stein.'' The New York State Supreme Court ruled in the gallery's favor.
        After the gallery closed in 1973, Ms. Webster wrote a cookbook, ''Eating and Living the Transcendental Meditation Way,'' which was published by Simon & Schuster.
        Survivors are her mother, Clarice Lee of La Jolla, Calif., and a sister, Lucille Driskell of Philadelphia.
