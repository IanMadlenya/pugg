        Ruth Schonfeld, a vocational counselor to refugees, died on Tuesday at New York University Hospital. She was 74 years old and lived in Mamaroneck, N.Y.
        Mrs. Schonfeld died of ovarian cancer, her husband said.
        She joined the staff of the New York Association for New Americans in 1975 and specialized in helping foreign-born musicians find jobs with orchestras around the country.
        In the late 1960's, Mrs. Schonfeld was a founder of the Guidance Center for Women, which helped women returning to work, at the University of Connecticut's department of continuing education.
        She was a graduate of Barnard College and held two master's degrees, one from Teachers College, Columbia University, and the second in chemistry from Columbia University.
        She is survived by her husband, Moses; two daughters, Deborah Statt Winegar of Manhattan and Jo-Ann Harrison of Kiryat Ono, Israel; a son, Victor of London; a sister, Miriam Waldman of Charlotte, N.C., and two grandsons.
