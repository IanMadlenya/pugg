        Flora Staal Hartog, who founded F. Staal, the Fifth Avenue jewelry store, 50 years ago and ran it until she retired in 1983, died yesterday at her home in Forest Hills, Queens. She was 87 years old.
        She died of lung cancer, her family said.
        Mrs. Hartog came to New York from her native Amsterdam in 1940. With her husband, Jacob, and their two sons, she escaped three days after the Nazi invasion of the Netherlands in May 1940 and soon reached the United States by way of England.
        She was the daughter of Abraham Staal, a prominent antiques dealer in Amsterdam. Her store, established a few months after her arrival in New York, originally sold china and silver but evolved later into a retail jewelry business. After several decades on Fifth Avenue the store recently moved to East 57th Street and is now run by her son Albert, of Chester, N.J. Her husband went into the food business and became chairman of Hartog Foods International.
        She is also survived by another son, Jack, of Manhattan; four grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.
