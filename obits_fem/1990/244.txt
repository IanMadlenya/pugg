        Her husband, James, said Mrs. Critchlow died of breast cancer.
        She was born in Warren, Pa., and was a graduate of Wellesley College. She lived in West Germany and France for several years before joining the institute, which deals with problems of the third world, in 1976. She retired four years ago as assistant to the director.
        Besides her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Ann Onanian of Merrimack, N.H., and Jane, of Cambridge, Mass., and a granddaughter.
