        Mrs. O'Neill, working for the Health Department, was a pioneer in ''well baby'' treatment, in which pediatricians monitor the development of healthy children. She later became director of the World Federation of Mental Health.
        She was born in Kansas City, Mo., and received bachelor's and master's degrees in psychology from the University of Minnesota. At the Cleveland Child Guidance Institute, which she joined after leaving the university, she made studies that led to acceptance in the United States of the psychological test created by Hermann Rorschach in Switzerland in 1921.
        She is survived by a son, Eugene, of Reston; two daughters, Sheila, of Westport, Conn., and Mona Sharkey of Elverson, Pa.; nine grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
