        Since her 1948 Broadway debut as a baffled bride in a revival of Noel Coward's ''Private Lives,'' starring Tallulah Bankhead and Donald Cook, Miss Baxley played a wide variety of roles in productions that ranged from Shakespeare to musical comedies.
        In 1960 she played a different bride, this one from Texas, in the Tennessee Williams play ''Period of Adjustment,'' for which she received a Tony nomination.
        She also won critical praise as Sally Field's mother in the 1979 film ''Norma Rae'' and again in 1981 as a business executive in Wendy Wasserstein's play ''Isn't It Romantic.'' In his review of ''Isn't It Romantic,'' Mel Gussow of The New York Times cited Miss Baxley's ''stylish personification of boardroom urbanity.''
