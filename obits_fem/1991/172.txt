        Hazel Brill Jackson, a prize-winning sculptor whose bronzes won critical praise, died on Friday at her home in the Town of Newburgh, N.Y. Miss Jackson, who remained active in her art well past her 90th birthday, was 96 years old.
        Miss Jackson's works, which included drawings and wood engravings as well as bronzes, were acquired by colleges including Vassar, Wellesley and Dartmouth; by fine arts museums in Massachusetts, South Carolina and Canada, and by many other collections.
        Although her busts of people received praise, she won the most recognition for animal sculptures. She received the Altman Prize in 1945 and in 1949 won the Ellen P. Speyer Memorial Prize for a piece titled "Indian Antelope." Both awards were given under the auspices of the National Academy of Design. In 1955, her small sculptures of animals were called "engaging and naturalistic" in The New York Times. Studied in Italy
        Miss Jackson was born in Philadelphia, to William Henry and Lizabeth Lee Stone Jackson. She studied at the Boston Museum School, the Scuola Rosatti in Florence, Italy, and in Rome with Angelo Zanelli. Her work was exhibited in the National Museum of Modern Art in Rome, at museums in Trieste and Florence, at the Royal Academy of Scotland, at the Springfield Museum of Fine Arts and elsewhere.
        An avid mountain climber, Miss Jackson was an active participant in American and Italian alpine clubs for many years. She also had a longstanding interest in animal rights.
        There are no immediate survivors.
