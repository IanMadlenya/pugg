        Natalie Donay, an advertising and cosmetics executive, died on Sunday at her home in London. She was 63 years old.
        Ms. Donay died of cancer, a spokeswoman for the family said.
        She began her career as an advertising copywriter for McCann Erickson, a Manhattan-based advertising agency. In the early 1950's she became advertising director of Charles of the Ritz.
        Ms. Donay was responsible for discovering Vidal Sassoon, the hairdresser, in London and brought him and his geometric style to the United States in the mid-1960's. In 1964 Charles of the Ritz merged with Lanvin and she became creative director for both companies, now part of the Revlon Group.
        In 1971 Ms. Donay rejoined McCann Erickson and moved to London, where she founded the London Fashion Group. She later retired to start an antique business in London.
        A native New Yorker, she was a graduate of the University of Wisconsin.
        Ms. Donay is survived by her husband, Donald Goddard, a writer.
