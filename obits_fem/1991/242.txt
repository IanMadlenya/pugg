        Sylvia Scribner, a psychologist on the faculty of the Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 67 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Dr. Scribner died of cancer, a family spokeswoman said.
        Dr. Scribner's research centered on cultural influences on learning and development. One of her best-known projects involved studying the literacy of the Vai people of western Liberia, who invented an original writing system. She detailed her research in a book, "The Psychology of Literacy," for which she received the Melville J. Herskovitz Award from the African Studies Association in 1982.
        Before joining the faculty of the CUNY Graduate School in 1981, Dr. Scribner was a research scientist at the Center for Applied Linguistics in Washington and, from 1978 to 1979, was associate director of the National Institute of Education. From 1970 to 1978 she was senior research associate at Rockefeller University.
        She graduated from Smith College in 1944 and earned a Ph.D. from the New School for Social Research in 1970. She began her career as research director for the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America in Newark.
        Her husband, David Scribner, a lawyer, died in April.
        She is survived by a son, Oliver, of Vancouver, B.C.; a daughter, Aggie Kapelman of Manhattan; three step-daughters, Toni Scribner of St. James, N.Y., Wendy Scribner of Manhattan and Nancy Jaslow of Abington, Pa., and two grandsons.
