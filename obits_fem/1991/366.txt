        Mary McDonough Phillips, an editor who helped train a generation of fashion journalists, died last Friday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center after a long illness. She was 77 years old and lived in New York City and Jupiter, Fla.
        She had suffered from a blood disorder for more than 20 years, said her husband, Lynn Phillips.
        Soon after graduating from Rosemount College in Rosemount, Pa., in 1935, she joined the Hearst Corporation, starting at Good Housekeeping magazine. She then moved to Harper's Bazaar, becoming executive editor in 1952. Carmel Snow, Nancy White and Dianna Vreeland were among her associates during the 1950's and 1960's.
        In 1971 she was named director of marketing of Harper's Bazaar, and in 1980 became retail marketing manager of Town & Country. Though she retired in 1984, she continued as consultant to Town & Country until the end.
        Through much of her career, she served as liaison between editorial and advertising deparments and helped shape the direction of the magazines for which she worked. Her friends included major fashion figures such as the designers Ben Zuckerman, Archie Davidow and Norman Norell.
        In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Michael, of St. Louis, four grandchildren and a brother, Edward, of Bridgehampton, N.Y.
