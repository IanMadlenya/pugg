        Helen Meany Gravis, who won the gold medal in women's 3-meter springboard diving at the 1928 Olympic Games in Amsterdam, died Sunday at her home in Old Greenwich, Conn. She was 86 years old.
        She died of pancreatic cancer, according to her sister, Louise Holmes of Riverside, Conn., her only surviving relative.
        Helen Meany won her first national Amateur Athletic Association diving championship as a 15-year-old in 1920 and qualified for the Olympics that year in Antwerp, Belgium. She won no medals there, nor at the 1924 Games in Paris. In Amsterdam, she became the first American woman to compete in three consecutive Olympics.
        She won 17 national championship diving medals from 1920 through 1928 and was named to the International Swimming Hall of Fame in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., in 1971.
        In 1946, she married Haywood Gravis and they made their home in San Antonio, until his death in 1957.
