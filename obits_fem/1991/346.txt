        Helene Mullins Johnson, a poet, died on Oct. 26 at her home in Manhattan. She was 92 years old.
        She died of congestive heart failure, said Gerald Phelan, a friend.
        Mrs. Johnson first had her poems published in The Pagan, a Greenwich Village magazine, in the 1920's. After Thornton Wilder introduced her to his publisher, Harper's published her first novel, "Convent Girl," and her first volume of poems, "Earthbound," in 1929. Her verse also appeared in The New York Times, The New Yorker, Commonweal, Saturday Review and other publications. Her final collection of poems, "Mirrored Walls," was published in 1970.
        There are no survivors.
