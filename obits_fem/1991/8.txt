        She died of cancer, a family spokeswoman said.
        Ms. Moore had served as secretary for racial and social justice with the Board for Homeland Ministries of the United Church of Christ since 1988. She worked on programs to help the clergy and laity respond to social issues and initiated programs to help immigrant women and the homeless.
        Before that, she was assistant minister of St. Alban's Congregational Church in Queens.
        A graduate of New York Theological Seminary, Ms. Moore was ordained in 1982. She also held positions with the National Council of Churches and the Interreligious Foundation for Community Organization. She was a member of the Central Jersey Chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
        She is survived by two daughters, Sharon-Frances and Meredith, both of Dayton; and two brothers, Edward B. Adams of Austin, Tex., and Dr. Clarence Lancelot Adams of Manhattan.
