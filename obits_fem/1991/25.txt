        Mary de Groat Reed, a leader in the reform wing of the Democratic Party in Manhattan in the 1950's, died on Tuesday at the Southampton Nursing Home on Long Island. She was 77 years old and lived in Sagaponack, L.I.
        She died of respiratory failure, her family said.
        Mrs. Reed, a native of Duluth, Minn., was a graduate of Wells College and held a master's degree from the University of Geneva. In World War II she was with the Office of Inter-American Affairs in Washington.
        She was a founder of the New Democratic Club in the Eighth Assembly District South on the East Side, one of the first clubs in what was to become the reform movement in the party. She was elected district leader in 1955 and 1957. She left New York in 1959, but remained active in Democratic politics.
        She is survived by two daughters, Julia, of Manhattan, and Cornelia, of Sagaponack.
