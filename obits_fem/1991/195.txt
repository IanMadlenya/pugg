        Emily Coolidge Stone, a former director of membership at the Museum of Modern Art, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 83 years old.
        She died after a stroke, her daughter said.
        Before joining the museum in 1947 she was a research assistant for the Office of Strategic Services.
        Mrs. Stone, who attended Radcliffe College, was a director of the France-America Society and a member of the Museum of Modern Art International Council and the International Council of Museums.
        A widow, she is survived by her daughter, Edith Woodruff Kunhardt of Manhattan, four grandchildren and four great-granchildren.
