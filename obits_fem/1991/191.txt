        Wally Toscanini, a daughter of Arturo Toscanini who was known in Italy for her charitable works, died yesterday at the home of her daughter in Rome. She was 91 years old and had lived in Rome in recent years.
        She died of congestive heart failure, said her sister, Wanda Horowitz of Manhattan.
        One of Toscanini's three children, Walter, Wally and Wanda, she lived most of her life in Milan. She devoted much of her time to raising money for orphaned children throughout Italy and for restoring La Scala, where her father was the principal conductor for many years.
        Her marriage to Count Emanuele di Castelbarco in 1931 ended in divorce.
        Besides her sister, the widow of the pianist Vladimir Horowitz, she is survived by her daughter, Emanuela Castelbarco, and a grandson.
