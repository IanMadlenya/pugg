        Jeanette Leentvaar, a Dutch dancer, teacher and choreographer, died on Monday at a friend's home in Caracas, Venezuela, after a long illness. She was 41 years old.
        She died of cancer, said Elaine Shipman, a friend and colleague.
        Ms. Leentvaar, born in Scheveningen, the Netherlands, trained at the Scapino Dance Academy in Amsterdam. She performed with the Israel National Opera and Bat-Dor in the early 1970's, coming to New York City in 1974 to study at the Merce Cunningham Studio. Ms. Leentvaar performed in dances by Albert Reid and Ms. Shipman, as well as in her own choreography, and for a time owned a restaurant in the Chelsea section of Manhattan. At the time of her death, she was a staff member of the dance department at the Theater School in Amsterdam.
        Ms. Leentvaar is survived by her sister, Mildred, of Arnheim, the Netherlands.
