        Charlotte Baruth, a former president of the New York Federation of Women's Clubs, died on Monday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She died of a heart attack, her grandson Charles Hutson of Washington, said.
        Mrs. Baruth, who was active in civic affairs, headed the Federation in the mid-1950's. She was also involved in aiding disabled veterans after World War II.
        A native of Hernando, Miss., she had been a former director of audience services for Ed Sullivan Productions in the 1950's and 60's. Her first job was in silent films.
        Her husband, Alfred, a teacher at the Horace Mann School in the Bronx, died in 1981.
        She is survived by a daughter, Margaret Hutson of Manhattan; five grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.
