        Grace Hartley Jenkins Mead, a philanthropist and trustee emeritus of Columbia University's Teachers College, died on Wednesday at her home in Morristown, N.J. She was 95 years old and also had residences in Norfolk, Conn., and St. Croix in the Virgin Islands.
        She died of heart failure, a grandson, Nicolas W. Platt, said.
        She was appointed a trustee of Teachers College in 1934 and later was named trustee emeritus. From 1940 to 1965 she was president of Hartley House, a settlement house on West 46th Street that was named for her great-grandfather, Robert Milham Hartley, a New York civic leader.
        For more than 40 years, Mrs. Mead was president of the Hartley Corporation, a philathropic foundation that has contributed to charitable and educational institutions.
        She was born in Morristown, the daughter of George W. Jenkins, president of the family-owned Remington Arms Company, and Helen Hartley Jenkins, a benfactor of Columbia University. Mrs. Mead and her cousin, Marcellus Hartley Dodge, were major donors to a building program at Columbia that included the M. H. Dodge gym, Hartley Hall and the gates at Barnard.
        Her husband, Winter Mead, an executive for the Prudential Life Insurance Company, died in 1953.
        She is survived by a daughter, Helen Hartley Mead Platt of Madison, N.J..; a son, Robert Hartley Mead of Norfolk, Conn., and 12 grandchildren.
