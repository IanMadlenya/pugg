        Elizabeth Jay Hollins, an author who wrote under the name Elizabeth Etnier, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 80 years old.
        She died of cancer, her family said.
        Mrs. Hollins wrote "On Gilbert Head," a critically praised journal of her life in the 1930's with her first husband, the painter Stephen Etnier, on an island in Maine.
        The marriage ended in divorce, and in 1948 she married Harry B. Hollins. She published short stories and a novella, and in 1966 she edited "Peace Is Possible: A Reader on World Order." Achieving world peace was a cause for which she worked closely with Mr. Hollins, who died in March.
        She was born in New York and graduated from Barnard College.
        She is survived by two daughters, Stephanie Doane and Victoria Villamil; a stepson, Harry Hollins; four stepdaughters, Elizabeth Aldrich, Lilias Outerbridge, Evelina Kats and Angelica Braestrup; a brother, Peter Jay; three sisters, Sybil Waldron, Augusta Huffman and Katharine Bacon, and four grandchildren.
        A memorial service is to be held at Christ and St. Stephen's Church, 120 West 69th Street, at 4 P.M. on Thursday.
