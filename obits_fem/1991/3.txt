        Ada Moore, a singer and actress who performed on Broadway and in jazz clubs across the nation, died on Sunday at the Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn. She was 64 years old and lived in Brooklyn.
        She died of cancer, her husband, Paul J. Ash, said.
        Miss Moore, who was born in Chicago, attended the University of California at Los Angeles, and began her singing career in that city. In 1954, she created the role of Gladiola in the Truman Capote and Harold Arlen musical "House of Flowers."
        She sang at many jazz and supper clubs, including the Village Vanguard, the Hungry I in San Francisco and Mister Kelly's in Chicago, and at such theaters as the Apollo in New York, the Howard in Washington and the Royal in Baltimore.
        In the 1970's, Miss Moore wrote prose and poetry and published a newsletter, The American Negro Woman. In an article about Bessie Smith, Dinah Washington and Billie Holiday, Miss Moore wrote: "They were not just blues singers, they were innovators who took experience directly from the harsh and dynamic areas of life, refined it and gave it the form and beauty that moved us so much."
        Her only survivor is her husband, who is executive vice president of the Sam Ash Music Corporation.
        Correction:  January 11, 1991, Friday
        An obituary in some copies yesterday about Ada Moore, a singer and actress, misstated her relationship to Paul J. Ash. He is her former husband, not her husband. A corrected obituary appears today on page B7.
