        Eva Bertrand Adams, a gold miner's daughter who presided over the United States Mint for eight years, died Friday at a hospital in Reno. Miss Adams was 80 years old and lived in Reno.
        The funeral home said she died of natural causes.
        Miss Adams was born in Wonder, Nev., a gold-mining town that died when the gold ran out. She received a bachelor's degree from the University of Nevada and a master's degree in English from Columbia University.
        She taught high school English in Las Vegas before returning to the University of Nevada as an instructor in 1936. She also served as assistant dean of women at the university before beginning a new career in 1940 as the principal aide to Senator Pat McCarran, Republican of Nevada, in Washington.
        She continued as administrative assistant to Mr. McCarran until he died in 1954, then served under his interim successor and under Senator Alan Bible, a Democrat elected as Mr. McCarran's permanent replacement.
        While working for Senator McCarran, who was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, she received an bachelor of laws degree from George Washington University in 1948 and a doctor of laws degree from the university two years later. She became a member of the bar in her home state and in the District of Columbia, as well as of the Supreme Court bar.
        In 1961, President John F. Kennedy named her director of the Mint.
        During her tenure, Miss Adams authorized and supervised the construction of a new mint in Philadelphia and the expansion of the Denver Mint. She also battled an acute nationwide coin shortage in the early 1960's that was caused by hoarding and a proliferation of coin-operated vending machines.
        President Lyndon B. Johnson reappointed her in 1966 and she retired from the post in September 1969 for yet another career, as a management consultant in Reno.
        Miss Adams left no immediate survivors.
