        Maria Eisner Lehfeldt, a photo editor and agent who was a founder of the Magnum photo agency, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 82 years old.
        Mrs. Lehfeldt, a native of Milan, Italy, was educated in Germany and started Alliance Photo, an agency in Paris, in the 1930's. She came to the United States in the early days of World War II.
        In 1947 she brought together five photojournalists -- Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa, David Seymour, George Rodger and William Vandivert -- who formed the creative core of Magnum.
        Mrs. Lehfeldt is survived by her husband, Hans; a son, Richard, of Washington, D.C., and two grandchildren.
