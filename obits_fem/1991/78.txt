        Susan Karelitz Ginsberg, a lawyer who devoted her career to working with social agencies dealing with the problems of women and children, died on Friday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 59 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She died of lymphoma, said her husband, William R. Ginsberg, a professor of environmental law at Hofstra University Law School.
        Mrs. Ginsberg was a past president of the Women's Prison Association and Home, Inc., an organization that helps female ex-offenders rejoin society. She served with the organization from 1973 and was its treasurer at her death. She also served as counsel to the Child Welfare League of America; executive director of the Committee on Legal Abortion; a research assistant with the Citizens Housing and Planning Council of New York City, and a member of the board of the Scholarship, Education and Defense Fund for Racial Equality.
        She was a 1954 graduate of Yale Law School and had served with the Commission on Law and Social Action of the American Jewish Congress.
        Besides her husband, she is survived by two sons, Mark, an architect in Manhattan, and Joshua, a biologist and a research fellow at Wolfson College, Oxford University.
