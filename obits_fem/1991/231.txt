        Dr. Frances Arkin, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who practiced in New York for many years before moving to Miami in 1978, died on July 3 at the Miami Heart Institute. She was 87 years old.
        She died of a stroke, said her sister, Evelynne Abrams of Middletown, N.Y.
        Dr. Arkin, a native of Boston and a graduate of Tufts Medical School, was a founder in 1944 of the first psychoanalytic training program at the New York Medical College, where she was a faculty member for 24 years. Earlier she had served with the New York City Bureau of Child Guidance and had maintained a private practice here.
        She was a past president of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis. For 17 years before she retired in 1986, Dr. Arkin was a consultant in training of psychiatric residents at the Miami Veterans Hospital.
        Her longtime companion was Janine Rolland of Miami. Mrs. Abrams is her only family survivor.
