        Roberta Strauss Feuerlicht, an author of 18 books of history and biography who frequently espoused liberal social and political causes, died yesterday of congestive heart failure, her husband said. She was 59 years old.
        Mrs. Feuerlicht was born in 1931 in New York City. She earned a bachelor's degree from Hunter College in 1952, and after working as an editor of The Glen Oaks News and This Month magazine, began writing books. She published biographies of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Gandhi, Marie Curie, Theodore Roosevelt and Martin Luther King.
        Among her most discussed works was her 1972 study, "McCarthy and McCarthyism," which argued that the late Wisconsin Senator was "an enemy of America's basic institutions" who "came closer to destroying America than any Communist, foreign or domestic."
        Writing for The New York Times Book Review, Fred J. Cook described "McCarthy and McCarthyism" as "excellent, solidly researched."
        Mrs. Feuerlicht's 1977 book on the trial and executions of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti was praised in The New York Times by John Leonard as "the most comprehensive and persuasive account of the case we have," although he faulted the author for her tendency to "pontificate."
        She is survived by her husband, Herbert Alan Feuerlicht of Manhattan, and a son, Ira, of Brooklyn.
