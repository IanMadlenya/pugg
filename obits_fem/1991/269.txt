        Edythe Lutzker, a historian and author who went to college at age 46, died on Friday at St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She died of complications from lung congestion, her son Michael said.
        Mrs. Lutzker wrote a book on the first group of women to get M.D. degrees in England in the 19th century, "Women Gain a Place in Medicine," in 1969. She also wrote a biography of one of them, "Edith Pechey-Phipson, M.D.: The Story of England and India's Foremost Pioneering Woman Doctor."
        More recently, Mrs. Lutzker, with Carol Jochnowitz, wrote a biography of Waldemar M. Haffkine, a bacteriologist who discovered vaccines against cholera and bubonic plague.
        In 1950, when Mrs. Lutzker was 46, she enrolled in City College. "All my life I've had to postpone going to college," she said. "The problems that arise when a working woman brings up children forced me to put it off." She graduated in 1954 in the college's first arts and science class that included women.
        She received her master's degree from Columbia University in 1959.
        Mrs. Lutzker is survived by three sons, Michael, of New York City; Arthur, of Oakhurst, N.J., and Paul, of Washington; two brothers, David Levine of Margate, Fla., and Robert Levine of New York City; a sister, Miriam Gindin of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., seven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
