        Adele Lawrence Auchincloss, an artist, environmentalist and former deputy administrator of the New York City Parks and Recreation Department, died on Wednesday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 59 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She died of bone marrow cancer, her husband, the writer Louis Auchincloss, said.
        Mrs. Auchincloss, a past president of the New York Parks Council and of the Park Association, was appointed deputy administrator of parks in 1974 by Mayor Abraham D. Beame and served for one year, until the post fell victim to the city's fiscal crisis.
        A 1953 graduate of Bryn Mawr College, she also attended the Parsons School of Design. She was a trustee of the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Central Park Conservancy and the New York Botanical Garden. In 1980, she was president of the Central Park Task Force.
        She designed covers for her husband's novels and was the co-author of a forthcoming centennial history of the New York Botanical Garden.
        Besides her husband, she is survived by three sons, John and Andrew, both lawyers, of Manhattan, and Blake, an architect, of Mansfield, Mass; a sister, Susan Winchester of Prides Crossing, Mass., and one granddaughter.
