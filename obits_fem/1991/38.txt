        Cipe Pineles Burtin, who broke the sex barrier at the Art Directors Club of New York by becoming a member in 1943 and went on to become the first woman inducted into its Hall of Fame, died on Thursday at Good Samaritan Hospital in Suffern, N.Y. She was 82 years old and lived in Stony Point, N.Y.
        Mrs. Burtin, who worked under the name Cipe Pineles (pronounced seep pin-ELL-iss), suffered from chronic kidney disease and died of a heart attack, a spokeswoman for the family said.
        She was the former head of publication design at the Parsons School of Design and a former art director of British Vogue, Seventeen, Charm and Mademoiselle magazines.
        In 1943, she became the first woman to join the Art Directors Club of New York and was inducted into the club's Hall of Fame in 1975 -- the only woman inducted until last year.
        In 1967 she became design consultant to Lincoln Center and a member of the faculty at Parsons.
        She was a member of the visiting committee for the Harvard University Graduate School of Design and a former board member of the American Institute of Graphic Arts. She was also a former Andrew Mellon Professor at Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art.
        She was born in Vienna and came to the United States at the age of 13. She attended Bay Ridge High School in Brooklyn and won a Tiffany Foundation Scholarship to Pratt Institute. In 1932 she became assistant to M.F. Agha, the art director of Conde Nast.
        Twice widowed, Mrs. Burtin is survived by a son, Thomas Pineles Golden of Stony Point, N.Y.; a daughter, Carol Burtin Fripp of Toronto, and two grandchildren.
