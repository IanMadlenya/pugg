        Ruth Morley, a costume designer whose clothes were worn by performers onstage and in films for four decades, died yesterday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 65 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She died of breast cancer, said a family spokeswoman, Sidney Branch.
        Ms. Morley was especially adept at designing period costumes. She began her Broadway career in the production of "Billy Budd" in 1951, when she was also costume director for the City Center Opera's 1951-52 season. Her most recent credit is the unreleased film "The Prince of Tides," directed by its star, Barbra Streisand.
        Onstage, her costumes were seen in "A Thousand Clowns," "Toys in the Attic," "Inherit the Wind," "The Good Soldier Schweik" and "Take a Giant Step." She also designed costumes for the stage and television productions of "Death of a Salesman," starring Dustin Hoffman.
        Other film credits include "The Miracle Worker," for which she received an Academy Award nomination, "Ghosts," "Kramer vs. Kramer," "Taxi Driver," "Annie Hall" and "Tootsie."
        Ms. Morley is survived by her daughters, Melissa Hacker, a film maker and editor, and Emily Hacker, an actress, director and teacher of English.
