        Sister Frances Shanahan, a member of the Ursuline Order and a retired teacher, died on Friday at New Rochelle Hospital. She was 88 years old and lived at the Convent of St. Teresa in New Rochelle, N.Y.
        She died of complications of a heart attack, a spokeswoman for the order said.
        Sister Frances graduated from the College of New Rochelle in 1925 and entered the Ursuline Order in 1927. She later earned a master's degree in American history at Fordham University. From 1939 to 1962, she was a teacher and the headmistress at the Ursuline School in New Rochelle. She later joined the faculty of the College of New Rochelle as assistant to the director of finance and as director of financial aid. She retired in 1976 as the archivist of the college.
        She is survived by three sisters, Sister Elizabeth Shanahan, a member of the Congregation of Notre Dame; Sister Marguerite Shanahan and Sister Loretta Shanahan, both members of the Ursuline Order.
