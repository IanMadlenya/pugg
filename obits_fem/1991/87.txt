        Ellen Israel Rosen, creator of the mayoral office that later became the New York City Commission for the United Nations and Consular Corps, died on Monday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 51 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Ms. Rosen died of lung cancer, a family spokesman said.
        From 1962 to 1965, as assistant city commissioner to the United Nations, she created the first mayoral office providing programs and help to the United Nations diplomatic corps.
        Ms. Rosen, a native New Yorker, had been vice president for public affairs at the Battery Park City Authority since 1984. Before joining the authority, she was executive assistant to the president of Federal Metal Maintenance in Manhattan, and from 1974 to 1978, she was the director of executive staff relations for the New York City Off-Track Betting Corporation.
        She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Barnard College in 1961.
        Both her marriages ended in divorce.
        She is survived by her father, Adrian C. Israel of Pound Ridge, N.Y.; two daughters, Julie Ann Pollitz and Karen Jeannette Rosen, and a son, Thomas Andrew, all of Manhattan, and a brother, Thomas C. Israel of Manhattan.
