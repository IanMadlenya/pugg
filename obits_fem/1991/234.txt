        Eleanor Regis Sullivan, the editor in chief of Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine since 1982, died on Friday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 62 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She died of cancer, her brother George Sullivan of Belmont, Mass., said.
        She was the managing editor of the monthly mystery magazine from 1970 to 1982 while also serving as editor in chief of Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine from 1975 to 1981.
        She edited many anthologies of mysteries and wrote articles for newspapers, magazines and books, at times under such pen names as Lika Van Ness, Julia DeHahn and Ruth Graviros. She wrote a 1984 book, "Whodunit: a Biblio-Bio-Anecdotal Memoir of Federic Dannay," profiling the writer who, with a cousin, collaborated under the pseudonym Ellery Queen.
        She was also the secretary and a board member of the Mystery Writers of America, and won the group's 1987 Ellery Queen Award for Excellence.
        She was a native of Cambridge, Mass., and a graduate of Salem State College. She taught for a decade in elementary schools in Clinton, Conn., Cambridge and White Plains. For five years, she helped veterans of the Vietnam War at St. Albans Naval Hospital in Queens.
        In addition to her brother, she is survived by another brother, James, of Darien, Conn., and three sisters, Mary Ford, Catherine Collins and Anne Powers, all of the Boston area.
