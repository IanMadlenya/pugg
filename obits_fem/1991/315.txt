        Gladys Gage Dibble, a Michigan horticulturist who wrote widely on gardening, died Friday at the Georgian Bloomfield Nursing Home in Bloomfield, Mich. She was 90 years old.
        The William R. Hamilton funeral home in Birminham, Mich., where Mrs. Dibble lived, said she died of complications from a stroke.
        Mrs. Dibble, who specialized in small garden plots for city dwellers, wrote about gardening for several publications, including The New York Times, The Christian Science Monitor, American Home and House & Garden.
        She is survived by a son, Philip Gage Dibble, and a sister, Kathleen Gage Hutchison, both of Montreal.
