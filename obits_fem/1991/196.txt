        Bertice Reading, an American jazz singer and actress who became a theater and cabaret star in Britain, died on Saturday at King's College Hospital. She was 54 years old.
        Ms. Reading collapsed during rehearsals for "Notre Dame," a new musical based on "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" that is to open this month in Oxford. She died after a stroke, said Barbara Jebson, a spokeswoman at the hospital.
        Born in Chester, Pa., Ms. Reading began her career dancing at age 3 with Bill (Bojangles) Robinson. She later won a home-town talent contest for which the prize was a one-week appearance with Lionel Hampton's band.
        She moved to Britain in the mid-1950's and appeared in "Jazz Train," in a 1957 production of "Requiem for a Nun" and in a 1958 musical, "Valmouth."
        She received a 1959 Tony nomination as best supporting actress when "Requiem" moved to Broadway. The production starred Ruth Ford and Zachary Scott.
        In 1981 she appeared in a production of Shakespeare's "Measure for Measure" at the National Theater. She acted in a 1987 revival of "South Pacific."
        Her screen credits include "Little Shop of Horrors" and "The Moon in the Gutter." She also appeared in an Italian television series, "Bella d'Estate."
        Her first three marriages ended in divorce. She is survived by her fourth husband, Phillip Tutton, and a son.
