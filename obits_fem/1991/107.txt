        Katherine Z. W. Whipple, former director of health education for the New York Tuberculosis and Health Association, died yesterday at a continuing care home in Medford, N.J. She was 97 years old.
        She died as a result of a stroke, her stepson, James Whipple of Tucson, Ariz., said.
        After working for the American Red Cross, Mrs. Whipple joined the association's staff in 1922 and helped to develop its vast health education program. She retired in 1959.
        She was a graduate of Vassar College and received an advanced degree from Columbia University.
        Her husband, Leon R. Whipple, a professor of journalism at New York University, died in 1964.
        Besides her stepson, Mrs. Whipple is survived by two grandchildren.
