She graduated from Bucknell University, received a Master of Divinity degree from Yale University and a doctorate in German literature from New York University. She taught at Yale and at Drew University before joining SUNY in 1973.
        She is survived by her husband, James Carse, a professor of religion at New York University; her daughter, Alisa, a professor of philosophy at Georgetown University, and two sons, Keene and James, both professional musicians, of Manhattan. Two sisters and two brothers also survive.
