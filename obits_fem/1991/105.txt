        Helen Lacey Haskell, a camp administrator who was active in civic affairs, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90 years old.
        She began her career in 1929 as a co-director of Camp Treetops with her husband, Douglas. The coeducational camp was affiliated with the North Country School in Lake Placid, N.Y. In 1948 she became the camp's director, a post she held until she retired in 1969.

        Her husband, a former editor of Architectural Forum, died in 1979.
        She is survived by four sisters, Leonora Clark of Bloomfield, Conn., Agnes Fisher of Vero Beach, Fla., Vida Hofmann of Manhattan, and Mary Schultz of Fort Myers, FLa., and a brother William Lacey of Port Charlotte, Fla.
