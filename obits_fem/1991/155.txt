        Gladys Marcus, dean of liberal arts at the Fashion Institute of Technology, died on Sunday at New York University Medical Center. She was 79 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She died of cancer, a spokesman for the family said.
        Mrs. Marcus joined the faculty at the Fashion Institute of Technology as a part-time instructor in 1950. Before the year was out she had switched to full-time teaching. She left in 1952 to devote herself to her family. She returned to the institute in 1957 and, in 1977, was named dean of liberal arts.
        She was instrumental in expanding and maintaining a broad-based liberal arts program at the school as part of its career-oriented degree programs. A proponent of global education, she initiated an overseas curriculum for the fashion institute. She was a member of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools visiting teams evaluating other colleges.
        A native New Yorker, she was a graduate of New York University. She was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and received an M.A. from Clark University in Worcester, Mass.
        From 1943 to 1946, she served in the Navy as a lieutenant.
        She is survived by a son Bret, of Manhattan, news director at WNBC-TV.
