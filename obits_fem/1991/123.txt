        Selma Gross, a teacher and administrator in the New York City public school system for 32 years, died on Sunday at the Whitehall Convalescent and Nursing Home in Chicago. She was 57 years old and lived in Chicago.
        She died of cancer, a family spokesman said.
        Mrs. Gross was the head of the Office of College and Career Planning at the New York City Board of Education from 1985 to 1988, when she moved to Chicago after her husband, Theodore L. Gross, was named president of Roosevelt College.
        Besides her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Donna, of Los Angeles; a son, Jonathan, of Manhattan, and two sisters.
