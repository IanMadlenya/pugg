        Marjorie Hyde Bond, a fund-raising consultant, died on Sunday at the Community Hospital of Western Suffolk in Smithtown, L.I. She was 80 years old and lived in Peconic, L.I.
        She died of Alzheimer's disease, her husband, Jules, said.
        She began her career in 1958 with the Manhattan office of Robert College of Istanbul, and its affiliate, the American College for Girls, as director of fund raising. She remained in the post until the institutions were turned over to the Turkish Government in the 1970's.
        Subsequently, she conducted several major fund-raising campaigns. One was for Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn. Another was for the New York Botanical Garden that culminated in the restoration of its conservatory, renamed the Enid A. Haupt Conservatory for its donor, and the establishment of endowments for its maintenance.
        Her last fund-raising campaign in the late 1970's resulted in the acquisition of the Mashomack forest preserve on Shelter Island by the Nature Conservancy, a national environmental organization.
        Mrs. Bond was born in Bradford, Pa., graduated from Skidmore College and did graduate work in child psychology at Yale.
        Her husband survives her.
