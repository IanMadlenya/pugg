        Rhoda Bacmeister, an authority on early childhood education who directed nursery schools and wrote eight books about children, died on Wednesday at All Saints Catholic Nursing Home in Jacksonville, Fla. She was 97 years old and lived in Clemson, S.C.
        She died of respiratory failure, her family said.

After the war she was director of the Manhattanville Nursery School on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
        She was a native of Northampton, Mass., and a graduate of Vassar College and the University of Chicago, where she earned a master's degree.
        Mrs. Bacmeister wrote four books on early childhood education and four on literature for children.
        She is survived by two daughters, Lucretia Harrison of Port Washington and Margaret Gruger of Anderson, S.C.; a son, Theodore, of Jacksonville; five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.
