        Natalie Schafer, an actress best known as the stranded millionaire's wife, Lovey, on the long-running television series "Gilligan's Island," died on Wednesday at her home. She was 90 years old.
        She died of cancer, a family spokesman, Frank Lieberman, said.
        On "Gilligan's Island" Miss Schafer played the wife of Thurston Howell 3d, portrayed by the late Jim Backus. They were among the marooned charter boat passengers.
        The comedy show originally ran on CBS from 1964 to 1967 and remains enormously popular in reruns. There were also three television movies that reunited the original cast: "Rescue From Gilligan's Island" in 1978, "The Castaways on Gilligan's Island" in 1979 and "The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan's Island" in 1981.
        Miss Schafer was born in Red Bank, N.J. She appeared in a number of Broadway productions from the 1920's though the 1950's, including Moss Hart's "Lady in the Dark" (1941), Peter Ustinov's "Romanoff and Juliet" (1957) and Dore Schary's "Highest Tree" (1959).
        Her film credits included "Molly and Me," with Gracie Fields; "Wonder Man," with Danny Kaye, and "Dishonored Lady," with Hedy Lamarr.
        Miss Schafer also appeared on television in such shows as "I Love Lucy," "Topper," "Route 66," "77 Sunset Strip" and "The Beverly Hillbillies."
        Miss Schafer's husband, the actor Louis Calhern, died in 1956.
        There are no immediate survivors.
