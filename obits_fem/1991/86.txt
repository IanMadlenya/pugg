        Jane Lloyd-Jones, a stage actress, died yesterday at Benedictine Hospital in Kingston, N.Y. She was 69 years old and had homes in Woodstock, N.Y., and Manhattan.
        She died of a stroke, said her husband, Heywood Hale Broun, the writer, broadcaster and actor.
        Ms. Lloyd-Jones, a native of Chicago, received a bachelor's degree in drama at the Carnegie Institute of Technology. She appeared on Broadway in "The Shop at Sly Corner," a 1949 thriller starring Boris Karloff, and in "The Gray-Eyed People," a 1952 comedy with Walter Matthau.
        Off Broadway, the actress had leading roles in "No Exit," "The Daughters of Atrius" and "Macbeth" and in a 1970 production of "Little Murders" at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven.
        Her husband is her only immediate survivor. Their son, Hob Broun, a writer, died in 1987.
