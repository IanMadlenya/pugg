        Joan D. Abrams, a former superintendent of schools in Red Bank, N.J., and a leader in the movement to open doors for women in school administration, died on Sunday at Morristown Memorial Hospital in New Jersey. She was 62 years old and lived in Short Hills, N.J.
        Dr. Abrams died of breast cancer, her son, Linus, said.
        As an educator, one of Dr. Abrams's concerns was advancing early detection of learning problems. In the Red Bank school system, where she was superintendent from 1974 to 1987, she began a systematic way for a teacher to determine how much a student had learned. She lectured nationally on this method, called mastery learning.
        Before going to Red Bank, Dr. Abrams was superintendent of schools in Montvale, N.J. In New York City, where she began her career, she was principal of Public School 165, assistant principal of Public School 41 and a teacher at Public School 192.
        Dr. Abrams received her Ph.D. in education administration from New York University in 1971. When she moved into administration, she was one of a few women in the nation in the top echelons of administration. To help change this, she founded the National Women's Caucus of the American Association of School Administrators.
        Besides her son, Dr. Linus Abrams of Brookline, Mass., Dr. Abrams is survived by her husband, Nathan, and a daughter, Lydia, of New York City.
