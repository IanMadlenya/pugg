        Dr. Margaret K. Chandler, the first female professor at the Graduate School of Business at Columbia University, died on Monday at the Somerset Medical Center in Somerville, N.J. She was 68 years old and lived in Piscataway.
        Dr. Chandler died of cancer, a Columbia spokesman said.
        She joined the Columbia Business School as a member of the management of organizations faculty, specializing in conflict resolution and collective bargaining. She was the first woman to do so; today there are 22 women on the faculty, five of whom are adjunct professors.
        Dr. Chandler had been a member of the labor panel of the American Arbitration Association since 1965. In 1976 she was appointed to the Governor of New York's panel for arbitration of educational disputes and, in 1977, she was named to the special panel of interest arbitrators for police and fire negotiations in New Jersey.
        She was a 1944 graduate of the University of Chicago, where she also received a master's degree and a Ph.D. From 1947 to 1965 she was a professor at the University of Illinois.
        She is survived by her husband, Louis Chandler, retired professor of nuclear physics at Rutgers University.
