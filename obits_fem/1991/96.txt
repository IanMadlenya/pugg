        Mabel Pickford Jenkins, a retired psychiatric social worker in New York City, died on Thursday at the University Village Retirement Center in Tulsa, Okla. She was 98 years old and had lived in Tulsa since 1984.
        Mrs. Jenkins, who lived in the New York City area for 60 years, died after a series of strokes, said Beatrice S. Hawkins of Manhattan, a friend.
        In 1924 Mrs. Jenkins became the first director of the social service department of St. Phillip's Episcopal Church in Harlem. In 1935 she joined the Bureau of Child Guidance of the New York City Board of Education. In addition to coordinating services for mental-health clinics in the school system, she supervised the training of students from Columbia and Fordham Universities and from Smith College.
        In 1962 she retired from the bureau and worked for two years in the children's psychiatric unit of the Jewish Guild for the Blind. Later she worked for the Community Service Society as a part-time counselor for the elderly. She retired for the second time in 1973.
        She was born in Virginia City, Mont., and was an alumna of Columbia, Chicago and Howard Universities. She received a master's degree from the New York School of Social Work.
        Mrs. Jenkins is survived by a nephew, Wilton Hines of Tulsa, and several nieces.
