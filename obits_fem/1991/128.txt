        Marjorie Lee Collins Bishopric, one of the early residents of the Devon Colony in Amagansett, L.I., died on Monday at her daughter's home in Amagansett. She was 79 years old and lived in Amagansett and Greenwich, Conn.
        She died of congestive heart failure, her daughter, Lucy Allison Sprunger, said.
        Her family was among the first to move into the Devon Colony, a group of Mediterranean-style houses privately built in the early 1900's. The houses, no longer a private enclave, have since been declared historic landmarks.
        Mrs. Bishopric was an active tennis player into her 70's, and won several amateur tournaments.
        Besides her daughter, she is survived by her husband, Allison Bishopric Jr.; a brother, J. Rawson Collins of Cincinnati, and two grandchildren.
