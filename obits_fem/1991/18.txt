        Selma Tamber Eisenman, a Broadway producer and manager, died on Monday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She died of a heart attack, said a nephew, Martin Poll of Los Angeles.
        Ms. Tamber produced several Broadway and Off Broadway shows, including "Boccaccio 70" and "Viva Madison Avenue." She also managed artists like Hanya Holm, the choreographer of "Kiss Me, Kate," "My Fair Lady" and "Camelot," and helped further the careers of the composers and lyricists Richard Adler and Stephen Sondheim.
        Ms. Tamber was born in New York City. In the 1930's, she supervised various Broadway musicals as the head of the department of composers and arrangers for the music publisher Chappell-T. B. Harms, where she worked with composers like George Gershwin and Cole Porter. She later became the executive assistant to the producers Herman Levin, Lemuel Ayres and Saint Subber.
        Ms. Tamber is survived by another nephew, Alvin Poll, of Cranbury, N.J., and four grandnephews.
