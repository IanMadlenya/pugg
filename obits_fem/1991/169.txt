        Geraldine N. Moon, vice chairwoman of the New Jersey Democratic State Committee, died at her home in Camden County on Wednesday. She was 57 years old.
        Mrs. Moon died of cancer, said her husband, Hampden.
        At her death, she was serving a second two-year term as first vice chairwoman of the committee. Mrs. Moon was also a member of the Democratic National Committee. She was a political associate of Gov. Jim Florio, who is also from Camden County.
        She was Winslow Township's deputy tax assessor from 1974 until June 1990, when illness forced a leave of absence.
        Mrs. Moon was also the founder of the Camden County chapter of the National Political Congress of Black Women. She graduated from Pierce Business School in Philadelphia and attended Rutgers University in Camden.
        In addition to her husband, she is survived by six sisters and two brothers.
