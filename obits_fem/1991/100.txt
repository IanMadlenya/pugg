        The Rev. Dr. Marie-Louise Schoelly Sherwin, a psychiatrist and an ordained Episcopal priest, died on Tuesday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 76 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She died of cancer, a funeral home representative said.
        Dr. Sherwin graduated from the medical college at the University of Zurich in 1942 and since 1950 had been a clinical professor of psychiatry at the Cornell University Medical College. She was also affiliated with the Payne Whitney Clinic at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.
        For more than 30 years, she was a senior psychiatrist with the court system of New York State and dealt with abused children. She had a private practice in Manhattan.
        In 1978, after studying at the Institute of Theology at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, she was ordained to the priesthood of the Episcopal Church and was affiliated with the French Church of the Holy Spirit. For the last six years, she was a non-salaried priest at the Church of the Holy Trinity on 88th Street in Manhattan.
        She is survived by a sister, Odette H. Rauch of Washington.
