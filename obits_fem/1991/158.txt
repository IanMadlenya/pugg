        Lucy Jane Ford Buhler, former president of the Women's Investment League, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73 years old.
        She died of pnuemonia, a spokeswoman for the family said.
        Mrs. Buhler was one of the first female investment brokers at Bache & Company, with whom she was associated in the 1960's. She retired in 1971.
        She was also president of The Women's Aid Society of 1844 and a volunteer at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's costume institute. She also helped run benefit concerts for the Metropolitan Opera National Council audition for several years.
        Her husband, Dr. Curt F. Buhler, keeper of printed books for the Pierpont Morgan Library, died in 1985.
        Mrs. Buhler is survived by a daughter, Lucille Ford of Manhattan; two stepsons, Ferdinand Schoettle of Minneapolis, and Michael Schoettle of Rolling Hills, Calif.; two stepdaughters, Joan S. Carville of Point Pleasant, N.J., and Mary Alice Jones-Ohlemann of Lake Oswego, Ore.; and eight grandchildren.
