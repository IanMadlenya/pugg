        Susan Price Carr, a lawyer with Time Warner Inc., died on Friday at Beth Israel Hospital North in Manhattan. She was 45 years old.
        She died of breast cancer, family members said.
        In the early 1970's, Ms. Carr was one of several female law students who filed sex discrimination claims against several large law firms. The suits were settled by the firms' adoption of procedures to assure equal opportunities in hiring for future generations of law students.
        Ms. Carr had been litigation counsel for Warner Communications, now Time Warner, since 1981. She was a graduate of Vassar College and of Columbia Law School, and she had received a master's degree in political science from New York University.
        Ms. Carr is survived by her husband, Anthony M. Radice; a daughter, Julia; her mother, Dorislee Kadis Carr, and a half-sister, Amy, all of New York City.
