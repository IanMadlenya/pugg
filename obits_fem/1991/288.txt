        Elizabeth Walt Baker Kelly, a retired dean of women at Middlebury College in Middlebury Vt., died Thursday morning at Burlington Medical Center. She was 83 years old and lived in Middlebury.
        A spokesman for the college said she died of cancer.
        Mrs. Kelly, a native of Montana and a graduate of Mount Holyoke College, joined the Middlebury staff in 1946 and was dean of women for 19 years before retiring in 1970. She returned to the campus in 1984 as hostess of Hadley House, a college guest house, and remained active there until several weeks ago. A residence hall was named for her in 1971.
        Mrs. Kelly is survived by a stepdaughter, Jane Choate of Waitsfield, Vt.
