        Dorothy Kramer, a Long Island church official, died on Monday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. She was 61 years old and lived in Port Washington.
        She died of breast cancer, a family spokesman said.
        Mrs. Kramer was active in hospice work in Nassau County and on the Veatch board of governors, the body that decides on charitable contributions for the North Shore Unitarian Universalist Church. She was the church delegate to the International Association of Religious Freedom in California and in the Netherlands.
        Mrs. Kramer began teaching in 1966 and retired in 1989 as an elementary and middle-school teacher in the Plainview-Old Bethpage Central School District. She was a past president of the district's local teachers union.
        In 1979 and 1980, she developed a curriculum for dyslexic elementary school children for New York State.
        Mrs. Kramer is survived by her husband, Donald, a retired procurement officer for the Grumman Aerospace Corporation; two sons, Donald, of Boston, and Theodore Charles of Brattleboro, Vt.; a daughter, Meredith Ann Brown of Harwinton, Conn.; two brothers, Robert G. Schwartz of Exton, Pa., and Louis Schwartz of Buffalo, and four grandchildren.
