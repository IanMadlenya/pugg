        Judith Leibowitz, a teacher at the Juilliard School of Music, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 70 years old.
        She died of cancer, her twin sister, Pearl Ausubel of Manhattan, said.
        Mrs. Leibowitz joined the Juilliard faculty at the invitation of John Houseman in 1968. She taught the Alexander Technique in the new drama division, a required course for all Juilliard students. The Alexander Technique is a means of improving and correcting body movement, and Ms. Leibowitz's students included the actors Kevin Kline, Robin Williams and Kelly McGillis.
        In 1964 she helped found the American Center for the Alexander Technique in Manhattan to train and certify teachers. She was director of the program until 1981 and remained on the faculty until her death. She also introduced the technique at many schools, including the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco and the Arena Stage in Washington.
        Ms. Leibowitz was co-author with Bill Conninton of "The Alexander Technique," which was published in August by Harper Collins Publishers.
        Besides her sister, she is survived by a niece and nephew.
