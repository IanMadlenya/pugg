        Frances Arick Kolb, an education consultant who worked to shape public school curriculums that would encourage achievement by girls and minorities, died last Saturday at Marlborough Hospital in Massachusetts. She was 53 years old and lived in Marlborough.
        Dr. Kolb died of breast cancer, said Max McConkey, director of The Network Inc., of Andover, Mass.
        She had been associated with The Network, a nonprofit research and training organization since 1980. She was also associate director of the New England Center for Equity Assistance, a federally supported program to provide help to schools dealing with desegregation.
        An advocate of textbooks reflecting the contributions of women and minorities, she was the producer of a video directed toward people of Hispanic descent, "Breaking Through -- Portraits of Winners." She also wrote several books including "Portraits of Our Mothers; Using Oral History in the Classroom" (The Network Inc., 1983).
        She was a founder and former board member of the Pittsburgh chapter of the National Organization for Women.
        Dr. Kolb was born in Worcester, Mass., and graduated in 1958 from Washington University in St. Louis. In 1972 she earned a Ph.D. in American history there.
        She is survived by her husband, Alfred, professor of the humanities at Quinsigamond Community College in Worcester; her mother, Beth Arick of Brookline, Mass.; a daughter, Sharon Cohen, also of Brookline, and a brother, Martin R. Arick of Newton, Mass.
