        Marion Letcher Bohmrich, a research analyst with the Office of Strategic Services and with the United States Mission to the United Nations, died on Thursday at Fair Haven Home in Bostic, N.C., where she was a resident. She was 89 years old.
        She died of pneumonia and suffered from Alzheimer's disease for 10 years, a spokesperson for the home said. She had requested that her remains be made available for research at the Alzheimer's Research Center at Duke University in Durham, N.C.
        Mrs. Bohmrich, a daughter of a Foreign Service officer, traveled and studied in Western Europe, focusing on German culture and tradition. In 1941, she was recruited by the O.S.S., forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency, as a social science analyst.
        After World War II, she was transferred to the Department of State and sent to the Mission to the United Nations, where she worked with Eleanor Roosevelt when she was chairwoman of the Commission on Human Rights from 1946 to 1951.
        A native of Turin, Ga., she attended a number of schools in Europe, Mexico and the United States, including Columbia University.
        Her first marriage to John Moore McKeehan Woodburn, a writer and editor, ended in divorce. She later married Louis Bohmrich, a Foreign Service officer and lecturer on foreign affairs, who died in 1981.
        She is survived by a stepson, Roger Bohmrich of White Plains, and a sister, Adele Letcher Goddard of Sun City, Ariz.
