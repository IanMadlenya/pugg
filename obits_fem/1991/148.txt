        Finvola Drury, who helped create and conduct research that led to a treatment for immune deficency in AIDS patients, was found dead on Thursday evening at the home of a friend in Brooklyn. She was 41 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause of death has not been determined by the New York City Medical Examiner. The friend with whom she was staying, Lucretia Strippoli, said Ms. Drury appeared to have died of natural causes.
        In the mid-1980's Ms. Drury assisted Dr. Bernard Bihari in research at the Kings County Addictive Disease Hospital in Downstate Medical Center that established the feasibility of using low dosages of a drug, naltrexone, to stabilize the immune systems of AIDS victims. The drug has also been used to treat drug addiction.
        Ms. Drury, who had no formal medical training, was an early volunteer in caring for AIDS patients. Associates said that in the last few years she had cared for more than 60 men who died from AIDS.
        She was born in Berwyn, Ill., and attended Bennington College.
        Ms. Drury's companion was Lester Elliott. She is survived by her parents, Finvola and George Drury of Rochester, and a brother, George Jr., of Chicago.
