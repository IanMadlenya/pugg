        Juliette T. Benton, a lecturer on books and plays who headed the Wednesday Book Group in New York for more than half a century, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 92 years old.
        Mrs. Benton and several other women founded the weekly discussion group in 1932, and she became its head shortly afterward, continuing until it was disbanded in 1987.
        She was a freelance lecturer for several decades, organizing reading and discussion groups throughout the New York metropolitan area. She wrote book reviews for The Litchfield County Times in Connecticut until shortly before her death.
        Mrs. Benton was born in Darlington, S.C., and was a graduate of Hunter College. She was a founder and board member of the Muscular Dystrophy Association.
        She is survived by three sons, Dr. Louis J. Scheinman of Seattle, Walt Witcover of Manhattan and Tom Scheinman of Hewlett Bay Park, L.I.; five granddaughters and one great-granddaughter.
