        Eleanor King, a modern-dance choreographer and a member of the original Doris Humphrey-Charles Weidman company, died on Wednesday at the Actor's Home in Haddonfield, N.J. She was 85 years old.
        Miss King had been in ill health since injuring her hip six weeks ago, a colleague, Mino Nicholas, said.
        Miss King danced with Miss Humphrey and Mr. Weidman, two pioneers of American modern dance, from 1928 to 1935. She also appeared in Leonide Massine's "Sacre du Printemps" at the Metropolitan Opera House in 1930. She began to present programs of her own work during the 1930's, and in 1943 established a company in Seattle. She became known for choreography based on works of literature, from Petrarch to James Joyce.
        Her dances were largely unknown to audiences of the 1980's until Annabelle Gamson staged highly praised revivals of her work in 1987 and 88 in New York. The solos were praised in The New York Times for their eloquence and for Miss King's careful shaping of ideas and feelings.  Studied in Japan
        Miss King was born in Middletown, Pa. She trained in dance at the Theater Guild School and with Miss Humphrey and Mr. Weidman. She also studied mime with Etienne Decroux, and in the early 1960's studied dance in Japan. She taught at the University of Arkansas from 1951 to 1971, and then retired, making her home in Santa Fe, N.M.
        The revival of her dances renewed interest in Miss King, as did her work with Mr. Nicholas on revivals of her own dances and those of Miss Humphrey and Mr. Weidman. At the time of her death she was a director of Mr. Nicholas's American Dance Repertory Theater. She wrote the book "Transformations," a memoir of the Humphrey-Weidman era, and was the subject of a 1989 collection of essays, "Eleanor King: 60 Years in American Dance."
        Miss King is survived by a brother, John, of Sahuar Rita, Ariz., and a sister, Lucile C. King of Cherry Hill, N.J.
