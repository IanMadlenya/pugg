        Joan Colebrook, a writer, died on Saturday at Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis, Mass. She was 80 years old and lived in Truro, Mass.
        She died after a heart attack, her son Jay Colebrook said.
        Mrs. Colebrook wrote two novels in the 1940's, one about pre-World War II life in England, the other, "The Northerner" (1948), about life in Australia, where she grew up.
        She received most praise for her nonfiction books. In "The Cross of Lassitude: Portraits of Five Delinquents" (1967), she used her experiences as a social worker and officer in women's prisons to track five teen-age girls through the penal system. She also wrote for Commentary, The New Yorker and other magazines.
        In addition to her son Jay, of Geneva, Mrs. Colebrook is survived by another son, John Van Kirk of Boston, and a daughter, Binda, of Seattle.
