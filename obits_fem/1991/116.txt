        Elizabeth Olds, a writer and artist of children's books, died on Monday in Sarasota, Fla., where she lived. She was 94 years old.
        Miss Olds was the first woman to hold a Guggenheim Fellowship in art.
        During the fellowship, she studied art in Paris, where she also trained as a bareback horse rider and performed with the Cirque d'Hiver.
        She was born in Minneapolis and came to New York in 1921. During the Depression, she focused on depicting the lives of working people.
        Her works were exhibited in solo shows and group shows over five decades, and she is represented in several museums. The largest single collection, 40 of her prints, is at the National Museum of American Art in Washington.
        She wrote and illustrated six children's books, four of which became Junior Literary Guild selections.
        Miss Olds is survived by a nephew, Emmett L. Hudspeth of Austin, Tex.
