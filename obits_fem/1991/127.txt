        Katya Delakova, a dancer and choreographer who specialized in Jewish themes, died Wednesday at her home in Titusville, N.J. She was 76 years old.
        She died of cancer, her husband, Moshe M. Budmor, said.
        Born in Vienna, Miss Delakova graduated from the Academy of Music and Dance. She performed and toured Europe with Gertrud Kraus, a modern dancer, until fleeing the Nazis and immigrating to New York in 1939.
        In 1942, she married Fred Berk, a dancer with whom she presented programs of Jewish dance. She began the first classes in Jewish folk dance at the 92d Street Y and with her husband created the Jewish Dance Repertory Group. They also conducted folk dance festivals for the Hebrew Arts Committee at the Jewish Theological Seminary.
        Miss Delakova lived in Israel from 1953 to 1958 after her divorce from Mr. Berk. It was there, after studying with Moshe Feldenkreis, that she became interested in Eastern movement disciplines, such as Hatha Yoga, which she also taught. From 1966 to 1975, she headed a program called "The Art of Moving" at Sarah Lawrence College.
        She is survived by her husband, a former professor of music at Trenton State College.
