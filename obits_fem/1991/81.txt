        Corinne Prevost Abel, a volunteer active in civic causes around the world, died last Friday in Colwell, England. She was 66 years old and lived in Palo Alto, Calif.
        Her husband, Elie Abel, former dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, said she had been in a deep depression and had taken her own life. Mr. Abel was conducting a seminar in England.
        A graduate of the University of Maryland, Mrs. Abel was a docent at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco and a volunteer at Stanford Medical Center. Earlier, when her husband was a foreign correspondent, she was the ORT representative in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, and worked at a clinic for autistic children in London.
        In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Mark, foreign editor of The San Francisco Chronicle; a daughter, Suzanne Abel-Vidor, director of the Grace Hudson Museum in Ykiah, Calif.; a brother, Arthur C. Prevost of Sunnyvale, Calif., and one grandchild.
