        Laura Riding Jackson, a poet, critic and co-founder with Robert Graves of various literary publishing ventures, died on Monday at the Humana Sebastian Hospital in Sebastian, Fla. She was 90 years old and had lived in Florida since 1938.
        She died of cardiac arrest, said Theodore Wilentz, a close friend.
        Born in New York City and originally named Laura Reichenthal, Miss Riding established herself as an important avant-garde poet in the early 1920's, when she attracted the attention of the Fugitives, a group of American Southern writers centered at Vanderbilt University. Members of the group included John Crowe Ransom, Allen Tate and Robert Penn Warren.
        In 1923, their magazine, The Fugitive, commended Miss Riding's first published poem for its originality, and in 1923 hailed her work as "the discovery of the year."
        In praising her poetry, the critic Paul Auster wrote that "in poem after poem, we witness her trying somehow to peel back the skin of the world in order to find some absolute and unassailable place of permanence."
        Later, Miss Riding joined the English poet and novelist Robert Graves, with whom she lived during the 1920's and 30's, as co-founder of a small literary publishing firm called Sezin Press, which lasted from 1927 to 1938. She and Mr. Graves also edited Epilogue, a series of volumes of criticism that contributed to a school of thought that became known as The New Criticism.
        In 1938, she married Schulyer B. Jackson, the critic and former poetry editor of Time magazine, and settled in Florida. She renounced poetry at that time, "as imposing irremovable obstacles to the realizing of the full potential afforded by language."
        Both because of her devotion to language and defiance of all social instituitions, the critic Martin Green once wrote, Ms. Riding became "a hero for all poets and other rebels."
