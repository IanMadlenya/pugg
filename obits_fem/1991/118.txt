        Teddy R. Zausner, the first president of the Manhattan chapter of Women's American O.R.T, or Organization for Rehabilitation Through Training, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 82 years old.
        She died of a brain tumor, a family spokesman said.
        She was a longtime leader of the organization, a volunteer group that promotes higher education for Jews through 800 vocational schools and training centers in 35 countries.
        Ms. Zausner, who was born in London and grew up in New York, graduated from New York University and worked as an X-ray technician at St. Luke's Hospital. In World War II, she was a member of the American Women's Voluntary Services, driving Navy personnel to ships and planes in the New York and New Jersey metropolitan region.
        She is survived by two sons, Martin, of Manhattan, and Richard, of Sands Point, L.I.
