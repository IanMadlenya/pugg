        Helen Herrmann, a veteran volunteer worker and former farmer in Monmouth County, N.J., who donated 71 acres of farmland to the county for preservation as open space, died on Thursday at her home in West Long Branch, N.J. She was 89 years old.
        She died after a stroke, said a friend, Virginia P. Kamin.
        It was in 1969 that Ms. Herrmann donated the land, where she had lived and farmed since 1946, said Laura Kirkpatrick, the public information officer for the Monmouth County park system.
        The partly wooded property, which Miss Herrmann named Baysholm, lies in Freehold Township and is now named the Baysholm Conservation Area and administered as part of the county park system.
        Miss Herrmann was born in Manhattan and earned a bachelor's degree from Bryn Mawr College and a master's degree from Columbia University. There are no immediate survivors.
