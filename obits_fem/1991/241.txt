        Clara Parker, who was the daughter of the founder of the Concord Resort Hotel in Kiamesha Lake, N.Y., and who took an active part in its development and interior design, died on Sunday at her home in Kiamesha Lake. She was 74 years old.
        Mrs. Parker died of the effects of a stroke suffered a year ago, a family spokesman said.
        Her husband, Raymond, is chairman of the resort in the Catskills, the nation's largest independently owned family resort hotel.
        Mrs. Parker became interested in breeding and raising cattle in the 1930's after meeting Henry A. Wallace, then the Secretary of Agriculture. With Mr. Wallace's help, she experimented in genetics in the raising of the brown Swiss breed. She continued her efforts at the family's farm in Grahamsville, N.Y., and more recently at its 10,000-acre ranch at Rancho Arroyo Grande in California.
        Mrs. Parker is survived by her husband, Raymond; a brother, Jules Winarick of Southampton, L.I.; three sons, Robert and James, of Kiamesha Lake, and George, of Tuxedo Park, N.Y.; two daughters, Naomi Friedman of Purchase, N.Y., and Laurie Parker of Kiamesha Lake; 10 grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
