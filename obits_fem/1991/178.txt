        Ilse Lichtenstadter, a teacher of Middle Eastern languages and philosophy, died Wednesday at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. She was 89 years old and lived in Cambridge, Mass.
        Dr. Lichtenstadter died of pnuemonia, said her nephew, Julius Marek of Brooklyn.
        From 1960 until she retired in 1974, Dr. Lichtenstadter was a tenured lecturer in Arabic at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Harvard.
        A native of Hamburg, Germany, she studied languages and philosophy at the Universities of Hamburg and Frankfurt. In 1931 she received a doctorate from the University of Frankfurt, where she remained until the Nazis came to power.
        In 1933 she moved to England and continued her studies at Cambridge and then Oxford, where in 1937 she received a doctorate in philosophy.
        The next year Dr. Lichtenstadter came to the United States and became a cataloguer of Judaica at the Jewish Theological Seminary in Manhattan.
        In 1942 she was named professor of Arabic literature and Islamic culture at the Asia Institute in New York. She also taught for several years at the Institute for Regional Studies of New York University and at Rutgers University before joining the Harvard faculty.
        She wrote and edited several books on Islam and classical literature.
        She is survived by a sister, Irma Ullmann of Palm Beach, Fla.
