        Nadya Olyanova, a graphologist who analyzed the handwriting of Adolph Hitler before his death and said he showed strong suicidal tendencies, died on Friday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 91 years old and lived in Greenwich Village.
        Ms. Olyanova died of pneumonia, said David Hollister, a close friend.
        Ms. Olyanova was a consultant to the psychiatric services of Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn and to the Menninger Clinic in Topeka, Kan. She was also a consultant to psychologists, psychiatrists and businesses.
        Born in a small town near Kiev in the Ukraine, she was brought to the United States as a child and grew up in Brooklyn.
        In the early 1930's she studied pyschology in New York with the Austrian pyschoanalyst Alfred Adler. She had a weekly radio show on WOR and analyzed the handwriting of thousands of people.
        In the fall of 1939, six years before Hitler's death, she wrote in The Ohio State Journal in Columbus: "Characteristic of Herr Hitler's handwritings are three outstanding traits: indecision, depression and morbid introspection. It takes no handwriting expert to recognize the cramped, drooping uncertain signature as a manifestation of the Fuhrer's cramped, self-centered approach to life."
        Ms. Olyanova was the author of two books: "The Psychology of Handwriting" (Sterling; 1960) and "Handwriting Tells" (Bobbs Merrill; 1936).
        Twice widowed, she has no immediate survivors.
