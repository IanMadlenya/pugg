        Elizabeth Sorel, a former fashion model, died Monday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 89 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mrs. Sorel died of complications from leukemia, said her daughter, Claudette.
        In the 1920's and early 1930's, Mrs. Sorel was one of the most sought-after models in Paris, modeling for members of the haute couture like Jean Patou, Jacques Fath and Chanel. A native of Budapest, she came to the United States in the early 1940's and, with her husband, operated Sorel Belt Creations in Manhattan. The store was later sold. She also worked for Saks Fifth Avenue as an accessories designer for Sophie Gibel.
        With her husband, Michel, who died in 1989, Mrs. Sorel operated the Shelton Apartments Inc., a real estate firm in Manhattan, from 1947 to her death.
        She is survived by a daughter, Claudette, a concert pianist and a professor of music at the State University of New York at Fredonia, of Manhattan.
