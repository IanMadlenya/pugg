        Isabel Cary Lundberg, an educator and sociologist, died on Monday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She died of lung cancer, a family spokeswoman said.
        Dr. Lundberg, a 1925 graduate of Vassar College, was an editor at several magazines, including Cosmopolitan, and an assistant to the president of an educational consulting firm before earning a Ph.D. in 1957 from the New School for Social Research. She then taught sociology at Hunter College, New York University and the Fashion Institute of Technology. She was a member of the American Sociological Association and wrote "Turgot's Unknown Translator: The Reflections and Adam Smith," published in 1964 by Martinus Nijhoff in The Hague.
        There are no immediate survivors.
