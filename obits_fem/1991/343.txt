        Gladys Krieble Delmas, a philanthropist and writer who gave more than $20 million to cultural and educational institutions, died on Wednesday at Beth Israel Medical Center.
        Mrs. Delmas, who was 78 years old and lived in Manhattan, died of heart failure, her lawyer said.
        Over more than two decades, she contributed more than $4 million to the New York Public Library. Gifts from Mrs. Delmas, a trustee of the library, allowed it to reopen evenings after the fiscal crisis in the 1970's compelled it to curtail hours. Last spring, a gift of $1 million enabled the library to remain open five days a week instead of four.
        Mrs. Delmas was also a significant contributor to the New York City Ballet and to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.
        Her fortune was based mainly on the family business started by her father, Vernon K. Krieble. The business, the Loctite Corporation, a manufacturer of glue used in industry, became a multimillion-dollar concern and the Kriebles were sometimes called the Rockefellers of the glue business.
        She grew up in Hartford, graduated from Vassar and in 1937, married Jean Paul Delmas. The couple lived in Europe and Latin America for 25 years. During her years abroad, Mrs. Delmas worked as a radio journalist, reporting for French National Radio and Radio Canada. Mr. Delmas died in 1988.
        She is survived by her brother, Robert H. Krieble of Old Lyme, Conn.; a niece, Helen K. Fusscas of Marlborough, Conn., and a nephew, Frederick B. Krieble, who lives abroad.
