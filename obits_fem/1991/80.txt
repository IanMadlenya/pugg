        Dorette Vock Assael, a fundraiser for charities, died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 59 years old and had residences in Manhattan, Paris and Cannes.
        Mrs. Assael died of cancer, a spokeswoman for the family said.
        She raised money for several organizations, including the International Sephardic Education Foundation, which gave scholarships to Sephardic youths in Israel, and Fountain House, a Manhattan rehabilitation center for the mentally ill.
        She is survived by her husband, Salvador J. Assael, president of Assael International, which produces cultured pearls; a daughter, Arlette, of Sausalito, Calif.; and two brothers, Daniel Vock, a lawyer, of Greenwich, Conn., and David Vock, a businessman, of Nice, France.
