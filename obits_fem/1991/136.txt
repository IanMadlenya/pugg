        Devorah Heller, the director of employee relations for the Yonkers public school system, died on Monday at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. She was 52 years old and lived in Yonkers.
        She died of breast cancer, said her son, Lawrence.
        Mrs. Heller joined the Yonkers school system in 1974 as a social studies teacher, worked with disadvantaged youngsters and in 1981 was named coordinator of information services. In 1986, when the Yonkers schools were desegregated under a court order, she was prominent as spokeswoman for the district at a time of great tension. She became director of employee relations in 1987 and handled contract negotiations with school employees. She was a graduate of Bronx High School of Science, Hunter College and Fordham University.
        She is survived by her husband, Michael; her mother, Beatrice Gittleman; two sons, Lawrence, of Manhattan, and Mark, of Plainview, L.I., and two sisters, Shula Brudner of Scarsdale, N.Y., and Toby Edelson of Suffern, N.Y.
