        Elizabeth Vera Loeb Stern, professor emerita of English at Hunter College, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 98 years old.
        Mrs. Stern died of natural causes, a spokesperson for the family said.
        Mrs. Stern began her professional association with Hunter in 1915 as a temporary instructor of English, speech and dramatics. During her tenure she established the first Hunter Theater and Concert Bureau and the first credit courses in dramatics, including the master's program in speech and dramatics. She retired as an associate professor in 1963.
        She was past president of the Hunter Faculty Club, the Hunter Chapter of the American Association of University Professors and of the Hunter Unit of the National Conference of Christians and Jews. She instituted the speakers bureau of the Manhattan League of Women Voters and, in 1973, was a volunteer administrator for the Union of American Hebrew Congregations.
        In 1973 she was given an award from Hunter for distinguished service to the Alumni Association and to the college.
        She graduated from Hunter College in 1915 and received a master's degree from Columbia University in 1948.
        There are no immediate survivors.
