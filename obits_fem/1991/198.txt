        Heidi Bruehl, an actress and singer, died on Saturday in a hospital at this resort near Munich. She was 49 years old.
        The cause of death was not immediately known, said her agent, Carla Rehm. Miss Bruehl complained of severe stomach pains on Thursday and had emergency surgery but never regained consciousness, her agent said.
        Born in Munich, Miss Bruehl began her movie career at the age of 12. She appeared in more than 20 films in West Germany, including "The Confessions of Felix Krull." She also became a popular recording star in her native country.
        From 1970 to 1972, she starred in shows in Las Vegas, Nev., and later founded a film company with her husband, Brett Halsey.
        After the couple divorced, Miss Bruehl began producing records. She returned to West Germany, where she acted in several television series.
        She is survived by a son and a daughter.
