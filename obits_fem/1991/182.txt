        Doris Malkin Curtis, president of the Geological Society of America, died Sunday at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Research Institute in Houston. She was 77 years old.
        She died of pneumonia, said a spokeswoman for the geological society, a 17,000-member organization based in Boulder, Colo. Dr. Curtis became its president last October.
        At her death, Dr. Curtis was a partner in a Houston-based geological consulting firm, Curtis and Echols, which she formed in 1979 with Dorothy J. Echols, a colleague for more than 50 years.
        Dr. Curtis received a bachelor's degree at Brooklyn College and a Ph.D. from Columbia University. She joined the Shell Oil Company in 1942, became a senior geologist there in 1959 and was a staff geologist with the Shell Development Company from 1975 to 1979.
        She was a past president of the American Geological Institute and the Society of Economic Paleontologists and Mineralogists, and headed the national committee on geology at the National Academy of Sciences.
        She is survived by a sister, Janet Adams of Santa Fe, N. M.
