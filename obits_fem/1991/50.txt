        Alice Vansteenberghe, a World War II Resistance hero and physician who testified against the Nazi Gestapo chief Klaus Barbie, has died, officials said Tuesday. She was 82 years old.
        No cause of death was given.
        At Mr. Barbie's war-crime trial in 1987, Dr. Vansteenberghe said that Mr. Barbie tortured her and broke her back after her arrest in 1944. Dr. Vansteenberghe, who died Saturday, was confined to a wheelchair.
        Dr. Vansteenberghe said she recognized Mr. Barbie's irregularly shaped ear lobe, which she had memorized while he was torturing her.
        She and her husband, Andre, were active in the underground group Straight-Shooters. Both remained in the Lyons area after the war and practiced medicine.
        Her husband died last year.
        Mr. Barbie headed the Gestapo section that captured Jean Moulin, leader of the Resistance. Mr. Moulin died under torture in 1943.
        Mr. Barbie, who lived in Bolivia for many years after the war, was sentenced to life in prison for crimes against humanity.
