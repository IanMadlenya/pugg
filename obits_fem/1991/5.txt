        Ada Moore, a singer and actress who performed on Broadway and in jazz clubs across the nation, died at Long Island College Hospital on Sunday. She was 64 years old and lived in Brooklyn.
        She died of cancer, her former husband, Paul J. Ash, said.
        Miss Moore, who was born in Chicago, attended the University of California at Los Angeles and began her singing career in that city. In 1954 she created the role of Gladiola in the Truman Capote and Harold Arlen musical "House of Flowers."
        She sang at many jazz and supper clubs, including the Village Vanguard, the Hungry I in San Francisco and Mister Kelly's in Chicago, and at such theaters as the Apollo in New York, the Howard in Washington and the Royal in Baltimore.
        In the 1970's, Miss Moore wrote prose and poetry and published a newsletter, The American Negro Woman. In an article about Bessie Smith, Dinah Washington and Billie Holiday, Miss Moore wrote: "They were not just blues singers, they were innovators who took experience directly from the harsh and dynamic areas of life, refined it and gave it the form and beauty that moved us so much."
