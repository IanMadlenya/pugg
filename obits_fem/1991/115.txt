        Virginia W. Milliken, an animal-rights advocate, died on Friday at her home in Sarasota, Fla. She was 88 years old.
        She died of lung cancer, said her daughter, Jane, of Riverside, Conn.
        Mrs. Milliken, who opposed the use of animals in medical and scientific experiments, was a director of the Humane Society of the United States and a founder of the Manhattan-based American Fund for Alternatives to Animal Research.
        In the 1950's Mrs. Milliken helped establish the first chapter of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in St. Petersburg, Fla.
        She was born in Roanoke, Va., and was a graduate of Barnard College.
        Besides her daughter, Mrs. Milliken is survived by a granddaughter.
