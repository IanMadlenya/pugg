        Jeannette E. Kriendler, a philanthropist and the wife of H. Peter Kreindler, the longtime chairman of "21" Club, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 77 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mrs. Kriendler, who had been suffering from osteoporosis, diabetes and pulmonary disease, collapsed at her Fifth Avenue apartment yesterday morning and died at Mount Sinai a short time later, her husband said.
        Mrs. Kriendler was born in New York City and was a graduate of New York University. During World War II she served in a number of executive positions with the Brooklyn chapter of the Motor Transport Service of the American Women's Voluntary Services, the organization that aided the armed forces and local military bases.
        She married Mr. Kriendler in 1933, three years after his brother, Jack, founded "21" Club on West 52d Street. Mr. Kriendler was chairman from 1938 to 1989, when he became honorary chairman.
        Mrs. Kriendler was a longtime contributor to the New York City Ballet and the New York City Opera and helped raise funds for them. She also contributed to Cornell University Veterinary School in Ithaca, N.Y.
        Besides her husband, there are no immediate survivors.
