        Austine McDonnell Hearst, a former reporter who was married to the editor in chief of the Hearst newspapers, died on Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 72 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She died of heart failure after suffering from lymphoma, a family spokesman said.
        For the last 40 years, she had worked for charitable causes, including the Girl Scouts, the Endowment Fund of Mount Vernon and the Abigail Adams Smith Museum in Manhattan.
        In 1946, she became a reporter at The Washington Times-Herald, now defunct. She wrote a sociey column, "Under My Hat," and later wrote a syndicated column, "From the Capital." She was also a commentator for the Columbia Broadcasting System.
        She and William Randolph Hearst Jr., chairman of the Hearst Corporation, were married in 1948. Her first marriage, to Igor Cassini, the designer, ended in divorce.
        Mrs. Hearst, who left the newspaper business in 1956, wrote "The Horses of San Simeon," (San Simeon Press, 1985), a book about breeding and raising horses.
        She was a graduate of the College of Notre Dame of Maryland in Baltimore.
        Besides her husband, she is survived by two sons, William Randolph Hearst 3d, publisher of The San Francisco Examiner, and Austin, of Manhattan, vice president of Hearst Entertainment and Syndication, a division of the Hearst Corporation, of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
        Correction:  June 25, 1991, Tuesday
        An obituary yesterday about Austine McDonnell Hearst, a former reporter whose husband is the editor in chief of the Hearst newspapers, misstated the occupation of her first husband, Igor Cassini. He was a newspaper columnist. (Oleg Cassini, the designer, is Igor Cassini's brother.)
