        Elinor Cocheran Ayers, a former high school teacher who became a leading dog breeder, died on Wednesday at the Southwestern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington. She was 62 years old and lived in Manchester, Vt. No cause of death was given.

        Her greatest victory came in 1984 when Ch. Seaward's Blackbeard became the only Newfoundland ever to be named best in show at the Westminster Kennel Club's annual fixture at Madison Square Garden.

High School and served as dean of girls at Montclair (N.J.) High School. She is survived by a brother, Stewart ayers, Of St. Petersburg, Fla.
