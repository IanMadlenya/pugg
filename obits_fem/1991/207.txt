        Dorothy B. Strong, a lawyer who was admitted to the bar in the late 1920's, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 86 years old.
        She died of heart failure, a family spokesman said.
        Mrs. Strong graduated from New York University Law School in 1927. She went into private practice in Manhattan and in 1945 she moved to Chicago, where she performed legal work for her husband, a banker.
        She is survived by a brother, Dr. Louis R. Burman of North Miami Beach, Fla.
