        Louise Brayton Kline, a preservationist who oversaw the construction of several buildings at Bard College when her late husband was president there, died on Monday at her home in Barrytown, N.Y. She was 79 years old.
        She died of cancer, a college spokesman said.
        Mrs. Kline, who ran several weekly newspapers after graduating from Middlebury College, helped preserve historic sites in the Hudson Valley. She helped restore Blithewood Garden and founded Friends of Clermont, a historic mansion in Columbia County. She also served on the visiting committee of the Harvard Divinity School and was a trustee of the Clinton Library.
        She is survived by three daughters, Florence Britton of Mill Valley, Calif., Penelope Bardel of Manhattan and Marcia Sharp of Washington; a sister, Josephine Brayton of Boston, and eight grandchildren.
