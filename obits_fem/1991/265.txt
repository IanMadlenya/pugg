        Lina Lee Brock, a professor of anthropology at Sarah Lawrence College, died on Tuesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 46 years old and lived in Brooklyn.
        She died of pancreatic cancer, college officials said.
        Ms. Brock, a native of Oregon City, Ore., studied at Wellesley College before transferring to Reed College in Portland, Ore., where she received a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy in 1968. She also held a master's in philosophy and a Ph.D. in anthropology from Columbia University.
        She was a lecturer in anthropology at Rutgers University and the University of New Hampshire before joining the anthropology department at Sarah Lawrence in Bronxville, N.Y., in 1981. Her scholarly interest centered on cultural anthropology and pastoral African societies, particularly the Tuaregs of northwest Africa.
        Ms. Brock is survived by her husband, Abel Bomberault.
