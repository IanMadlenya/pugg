        Jane Cooper Bland, a teacher of art and art appreciation to young children, died on Friday at Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia. She was 91 years old and had an apartment in Greenwich Village.
        Mrs. Bland died of heart failure after suffering complications following hip surgery, her family said.
        In 1951, while she was with the Museum of Modern Art, Mrs. Bland wrote in The New York Times Book Review that it was important "for us art teachers to provide the opportunity for children to express their ideas and feelings with confidence that they will be accepted and respected."
        Her work at the museum included holding classes for children and also providing instruction for other teachers.
        The other institutions where she taught in New York over the years included the Horace Mann and Fieldston Schools. She also held workshops around the country.
        Mrs. Bland was born in Boston, grew up in New York, studied at Pratt Institute and earned bachelor's and master's degrees at Columbia University Teachers College.
        Her writings included the book "The Art of Young Children."
        Mrs. Bland was the widow of Harry McNeil Bland, an art dealer who died in 1960.
        She is survived by a son, John Cooper Bland of Conshohocken, Pa.; five grandchidren and five great-grandchildren.
