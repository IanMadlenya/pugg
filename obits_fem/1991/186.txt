        Letitia Grierson, an educator and freelance editor, died on Wednesday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. She was 88 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She died of pneumonia, said her son, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt of the Bronx.
        Mrs. Grierson, who was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, came to the United States in the early 1930's and taught English at colleges and private schools in the metropolitan area. After her retirement in 1965, she became a free-lance editor and reviewed books for newspapers.
        Her marriage to Helmut Lehmann-Haupt ended in divorce in 1947.
        In addition to her son Christopher, book critic for The New York Times, she is survived by two other sons, Carl, a graphic artist and painter, and Alexander, a sound engineer, both of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
