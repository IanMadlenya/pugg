        Clara Leiser, founder of Youth of All Nations, a nonprofit peace organization that grew out of her experience with refugee children in World War II, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 93 years old.
        She died of congestive heart failure, said her niece, Anita Leiser, with whom she lived.
        Miss Leiser began her career as assistant editor and advertising manager of The Wisconsin Journal of Education. In the late 1920's she resigned to take what was to be the first of many trips to Europe in the 1930's.
        Moved by events she had witnessed during the rise of Nazism, she sought to ease the adjustment of hundreds of teen-age refugees from fascism, asking them what they missed most. Nearly all answered "friends."
        The result, in 1944, was Youth of All Nations, devoted to building understanding among the youth of many countries, races and religious beliefs through a correspondence program.
        To show how letters could improve international understanding, Miss Leiser would cite correspondence from a young German boy whose letters revealed his gradual understanding of democratic ideals.
        She wrote or edited several books, among them "Skeleton of Justice," with Edith Roper (E.P. Dutton, 1941); "Lunacy Becomes Us," quotations from Hitler and other top Nazis (Liveright, 1939); "Jean de Reszke and the Great Days of Opera" (Minton, Balch, 1934).
        A native of Milwaukee, Miss Leiser was a graduate of the University of Wisconsin.
        She is survived by a sister, Gertrude B. Wilde of Milwaukee.
