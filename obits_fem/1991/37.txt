        Alberta Masiello, a longtime singers' coach at the Metropolitan Opera and a regular panelist in the Saturday afternoon Metropolitan Opera Quiz, died on Christmas Day at her Manhattan apartment. She was 75 years old.
        Her physician, Dr. Sidney Goldstine, said she had been suffering from a long illness.
        Miss Masiello was born in Milan, Italy, into a family of singers; her mother, Josephine La Puma, had a subsequent career with small opera companies in New York City. Trained as a pianist at the Milan conservatory, Miss Masiello moved to the United States with her mother in the late 1930's, where she studied further at the Juilliard School.
        Gravitating to singing, she had a brief career as a mezzo-soprano, appearing in nightclubs during World War II and as Carmen and in other roles at the fledgling New York City Opera in the 1940's. But she soon devoted herself to vocal coaching, working privately in Manhattan and at the Chicago Lyric Opera in the 1950's before joining the Metropolitan in 1959.
        Her initial title was rehearsal pianist, but in 1967 that was upgraded to assistant conductor, although she never conducted a performance at the Met. Her task was to prepare singers and accompany rehearsals of the mainstream Italian repertory. She retired from the Met in 1981.
        Miss Masiello was best known for her frequent appearances on the Metropolitan Opera Quiz, an intermission feature of the Metropolitan's nationally broadcast Saturday matinee performances. There her store of knowledge and imperious manner beguiled listeners for more than 30 years, from her first appearance in 1959 as an accompanying pianist, to her last, in the spring of 1990.
        There are no survivors.
