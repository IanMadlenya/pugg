        Margaret Ann Chisholm, a bibliographer who worked for the Episcopal and Anglican churches, died on Wednesday at New York Hospital. She was 59 years old and lived in Manhattan and London.
        Miss Chisholm died after a cerebral hemorrhage, a spokeswoman for the family said.
        She was executive assistant to Bishop Stephen F. Bayne in London in the late 1960's and early 1970's. She was the bibliographer of Bishop Bayne's work, and edited "Invitation to Prayer," the meditations of Eric Symes Abbot, retired dean of Westminster Abbey.
        Miss Chisholm was born in Laurel, Miss., and was a graduate of Sweet Briar College in Sweet Briar, Va.
        She is survived by her mother, Elisabeth Gardiner Wisher Chisholm of Laurel, Miss., and two sisters, Jean C. Lindsey of Laurel and Manhattan, and Cynthia Saint Amand of Manhattan.
