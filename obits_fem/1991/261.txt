        Dr. Frances G. Dell, a retired English professor at Pace University, died on Sunday in Beverly Hospital in Beverly, Mass. She was 69 years old and had lived in White Plains until a recent move to Wenham, Mass.
        She died of congestive heart failure, a university spokesman said.
        Dr. Dell taught at Pace's Westchester-Pleasantville campus for 27 years before retiring in 1990. She was professor emeritus of literature, communications and the performing arts, and she specialized in 19th-century literature, particularly the works of Thomas Hardy, James Fenimore Cooper and the Brontes.
        A native of Queens, she graduated from Queens College and held master's degrees from Teachers College, Columbia University and Fordham University, where she also earned a Ph.D. in English.
        She represented Pace at three Bronte conferences in England and conducted an international Bronte conference at Pace's Westchester campus in 1985. Her articles on 19th-century fiction appeared in literary publications.
        At Pace, she also served on the university Senate, moderated the English Honor Society and for many years was supervisor of student teaching.
        She is survived by her husband of 45 years, Dr. Robert Dell, who also is a retired Pace professor of English, and two sons, Douglas, a Nynex executive in Middleton, Mass., and Blair, a law student in Texas.
