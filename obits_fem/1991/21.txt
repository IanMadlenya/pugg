        Dr. Harriet M. Griffin, who taught mathematics at the City College of New York for 36 years before retiring in 1966, died on Jan. 13 at Kimball Medical Center in Lakewood, N.J. She was 87 years old and had lived in Lakewood since her retirement.
        She died of heart failure, said a spokesman for the D'Elia Funeral Home in Lakewood.
        Dr. Griffin was born in Brooklyn, was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Hunter College, and held a master's degree from Columbia and a doctorate from New York University. She taught at Hunter College for four years before joining the City College faculty, where she rose to a full professorship.
        She wrote several mathematics texts and was a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
        Dr. Griffin is survived by two cousins, Virginia Walsh of Toms River, N.J., and Elizabeth Pirro of Red Bank, N.J.
