        Antoinette Rampinelli Sole, an interior designer, died on Saturday at a convalescent center in Holmdel, N.J. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She died of breast cancer, said her sister-in-law Irene Ramp of Matawan, N.J.
        Mrs. Sole was in business with her late husband, George J. Sole, an architect who designed the Roman Catholic Church of the Holy Family in Manhattan. In their work, he did the overall designs and she carried out the interior plans for office buildings, churches and private homes. Mr. Sole died in 1973. Mrs. Sole retired in the mid-1970's.
        She is survived by three brothers, Joseph Ramp of Matawan, Roy Rampinelli of Brooklyn and John Ramp of Coram, L.I.
