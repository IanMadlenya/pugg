        Charlotte L. Peskin, chairwoman and president of Polyplastex United, a producer of interiors for aircraft cabins, died on Tuesday at Holy Cross Hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. She was 76 years old and lived in Tamarac, Fla.
        She died of peritonitis after surgery, her family said.
        Mrs. Peskin was the daughter of Louis Schnitzer, founder of the Yiddish Art Theater in New York, and his wife, Henriette, a noted actress on the Yiddish stage. Mrs. Peskin was a child actress before attending Pratt Institute, where she received a degree in art.
        A longtime resident of Brooklyn and West Hempstead, L.I., Mrs. Peskin became secretary of Polyplastex, a publicly held family concern, in 1963. She was named chairwoman and president two years ago.
        She is survived by her husband, Sidney, also an officer of Polyplastex; two sons, Roger, of Milford, N.J., and Dennis, of Tarpon Springs, Fla., who are also Polyplastex officers, and three granddaughters.
