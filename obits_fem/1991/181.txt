        Wilhelmina Harris, for nearly four decades the superintendent of the Adams Presidential Family National Historic Site in Quincy, Mass., died on May 20 at her home in Quincy. She was 95 years old.
        She died of a heart ailment, a spokeswoman for the National Park Service said.
        Mrs. Harris had been associated with the heirs of Presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams since the early 1920's, when she became social secretary to Brooks Adams, a historian and a fourth-generation family member who died in 1927.
        In 1948 Mrs. Harris joined the staff of the historic site, which includes the birthplace of both Presidents and the summer White House they maintained. She was named superintendent in 1950 and served until she retired in 1987 at the age of 91.
        Mrs. Harris was born in Franklin, Ala., and was a graduate of Montevallo College in Alabama.
        Her husband, Col. Frank E. Harris, whom she married in 1928, died in 1947. Surviving are three sons, Frank 3d of Salt Lake City, George, of Washington, and Brooks, of Philadelphia; 11 grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
