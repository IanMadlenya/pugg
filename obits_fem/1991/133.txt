        Frauke Petersen Haasemann, the assistant conductor of the Westminster Choir and professor of conducting at the Westminster Choir College, died last Friday at her home in Princeton, N.J. She was 68 years old.
        She died of lung cancer, a spokeswoman for the college said.
        An authority on choral conducting, Miss Haasemann was recently awarded an honorary Doctor of Music degree from Westminster, whose faculty she joined in 1977.
        Miss Haasemann was born in Rendsburg, Germany, and studied church music and voice there. She was co-author, with Wilhelm Ehmann, of the book "Voice Building for Choirs," and a co-founder of the Westfaelische Kantorei, a professional choir.
        She is survived by three brothers, Klaus, Hans-Jurgen and Jens, all of Germany.
