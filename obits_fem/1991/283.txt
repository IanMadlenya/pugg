        Kathryn Cravens, one of the first women to be a news commentator on coast-to-coast radio, died on Thursday at her home in Burkett, Tex. She was 92 years old.
        Miss Cravens retired to Burkett in 1962, moving back into the home in which she was born.
        She began her career as an actress, playing minor roles in Hollywood silent films, then performing in soap operas and other radio programs in St. Louis. She also started her own program there, "News Through a Woman's Eyes," in 1934, then moved in 1936 to New York, where CBS began to broadcast the show nationwide.
        By 1937 she had logged more than 50,000 miles traveling around the country to cover news and had come to be known as the flying commentator. When the program ended in 1938, she wrote columns and features for newspapers, then resumed her program over WNEW in New York in 1941.
        In 1945, Miss Cravens became the first woman accredited as a wartime radio correspondent. She was arrested by the Soviet military authorities in Potsdam, Germany, after slipping into the conference site there before Truman, Stalin and Churchill. She went on to travel in 22 countries, filing reports to the Cowles Broadcasting Company and the Mutual Broadcasting System. She interviewed George Bernard Shaw and Pope Pius XII, covered riots in Palestine and helped reunite displaced persons in Europe with their relatives in the United States.
        Her one novel, "Pursuit of Gentlemen," was published in 1951.
        Surviving are several nieces and nephews.
