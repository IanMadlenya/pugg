        Jean Tennyson Boissevain, an operatic soprano and patron of the arts, died on Saturday at her home in La Tour-de-Peilz, Switzerland. She was 86 years old.
        She died in her sleep, her goddaughter, Dorothy Blencowe, said.
        Mrs. Boissevain appeared, as Jean Tennyson, with several leading European and American opera companies, including La Scala in Milan, the Chicago Civic Opera and the San Francisco Opera Company. She also sang on the CBS Radio program "Great Moments in Music" from 1942 to 1946.
        Mrs. Boissevain was born in Chicago and married Camille Dreyfus, the founder and chairman of the Celanese Corporation of America, in 1931. After his death in 1965 she served as president of the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation, which supports scientific education and research. Her second husband, Ernest W. Boissevain, died in 1984.
        After World War II, she founded the Artists Veterans Hospital Programs of the Musicians Emergency Fund, which presented concerts for patients in veterans hospitals. She also served as a patron of the Philharmonic Society of New York and as vice chairman of the Lewisohn Stadium Concerts.
        Mrs. Boissevain received several awards, including the Italian Stella della Solidarieta and the St. Olaf Medal from the King of Norway.
        There are no immediate survivors.
