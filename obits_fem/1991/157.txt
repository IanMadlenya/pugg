        Barbara A. Bannon, a retired executive editor of Publishers Weekly, died last Friday at St. Vincent's Hospital from injuries in a fall the day before. She was 67 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Miss Bannon, who was born in Auburn, N.Y., and was a graduate of Manhattanville College, joined Publishers Weekly in 1946 and became chief fiction reviewer for Forecast, the publication's advance review section. She retired in 1983.
        In 1978 Miss Bannon received the American Booksellers Association's Irita Van Doren Award for her contributions to promoting books as an instrument of culture. She was a Pulitzer Prize committee chairwoman and a judge of the general nonfiction category on four occasions.
        She is survived by a cousin, Margaret Dermady of Syracuse.
