        Nedda Casson Anders, a publisher and writer who edited the first Weight Watchers cookbook, died on Wednesday at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 70 years old, her family said, and lived in Manhattan and Tamarac, Fla.
        Her son, Richard, said she died of cancer.
        Mrs. Anders, who was born in the Bronx and grew up in Brooklyn, first worked for M. Barrows publishing, where she wrote and edited books on cooking and crafts. In the mid-1950's she and her husband, George Anders, who died in 1987, began their own publishing company, Hearthside Press, which specialized in works on cooking, crafts and gardening.
        Among the books she wrote were "Complete Cookbook for Infra-Red Broiler and Rotisserie," published by M. Barrows, and "Casserole Specialties" and "Chafing-Dish Specialties," both for Hearthside. Reviewers praised her recipes as clearly written and easy to follow.
        But her biggest success was the editing of "The Weight Watchers Program Cookbook" by Jean Nidetch, which sold millions of copies.
        In addition to her son, Richard, of Boston, she is survived by two sisters, Judy Halpern of Fresh Meadows, Queens, and Toby Halpern of Malverne, L.I.; a brother, Walter Casson of Rockville Centre, L.I.; and two grandchildren.
