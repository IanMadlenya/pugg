        Margaret Ramsay, a theatrical agent who was a leading figure in the British theater, died on Wednesday in the London Clinic. She was 83 years old.
        She died of heart and circulatory problems, her assistant, Mary Carter, said.
        Miss Ramsay, known to many as Peggy, built a formidable client list in the decades she worked as an agent, representing among others the playwrights Robert Bolt, Eugene Ionesco, Alan Ayckbourn, Vaclav Havel, Christopher Hampton, Larry Kramer, Edward Bond, Caryl Churchill and David Hare. One of her best-known clients was the playwright Joe Orton; in the 1987 Stephen Frears film about Orton's life, "Prick Up Your Ears," Miss Ramsay was played by Vanessa Redgrave.
        Miss Ramsay was born Margaret Venniker on May 28, 1908, in a small town near Sydney, Australia. She was raised in South Africa, where her father had inherited an ostrich farm. Around 1930, she married Norman Ramsay, a professor of psychology, and with him moved to England; shortly afterward, their marriage ended.
        She entered the theater first as a singer, then as an actress, and spent some time working in theater production and management before opening her agency early in the 1950's.
        Soon she was representing many of the avant-garde playwrights whose works were regularly presented at the Royal Court Theater in the 50's and 60's. It was Miss Ramsay who introduced the Romanian-born Mr. Ionesco to the English stage.
        Miss Ramsay was widely admired for her devotion to good writing and social commitment, and one of her favorite admonitions to a new writer was, "Don't extract the teeth from anything, dear."
        Her longtime companion, the actor William Roderick, died in April. There are no immediate survivors.
