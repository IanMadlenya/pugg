        Lydia Cabrera, a scholar and chronicler of Afro-Cuban culture, died at her home in Miami last Thursday of heart failure, according to her companion, Teresa de la Parra. Ms. Cabrera was 91 years old.
        An ethnologist, artist, oral historian and writer of folk tales, Ms. Cabrera devoted most of her life to the study of Cuba's African-based culture and religions. Ms. Cabrera's Miami home, up to the time of her death, was a mecca for writers, academics, artists and students of Afro-Cuban culture and intellectual exiles from Cuba.
        She produced 23 books about Cuba, including scholarly works and collections of folk tales rooted in Africa and passed down through generations of black Cuban slaves. Her best-known book was El Monte, published in 1954. It is considered the seminal book on santeria, the melange of Roman Catholic and African religious practices that developed in the Caribbean countries and that remains current. The Castro Government last year published El Monte without her permission.
        Ms. Cabrera was born in Havana, but developed her interest in Afro-Cuban culture in Paris, where she had gone in 1927 to study Asian religion and art. She moved back to Cuba in 1938 and then fled, first to Madrid and then to Miami, in 1960, after the Cuban revolution. She lived in Spain again in the mid-1970's.
        Ms. Cabrera held honorary doctorates from Denison University in Ohio, Redlands University in California and Manhattan College in New York City.
        There were no immediate survivors.
