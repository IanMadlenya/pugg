        Frances Weitzenhoffer, an art historian, editor and specialist in Impressionist painting, died on Sunday in Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 46 years old.
        She died of breast cancer, her husband, Max, said.
        Mrs. Weitzenhoffer was the author of "The Havemeyers: Impressionism Comes to America" (1986), an authoritative account, based on solid and original research, of a central moment in the history of American taste.
        For many years the protegee and professional associate of John Rewald, the pioneer authority of French Impressionism, she edited three of Mr. Rewald's more recent books, "Aspects of Monet," "Studies in Impressionism" and "Studies in Post-Impressionism."
        She also acted as a consultant on Impressionist painting to Christie's auction house and was chairwoman of the committee that is working on the revised edition of Adelyn Breeskin's catalogue raisonne of Mary Cassatt.
        She was born on March 13, 1944, in Louisville, Ky. Educated at the Kentucky Home School for Girls in Louisville, she later specialized in art history at the University of Pennsylvania, Columbia University and the City University of New York, where she earned a Ph.D. She also studied at the Ecole du Louvre in Paris, and was for a time an instructor in art history at Queens College.
        In addition to her husband, a theatrical producer and former art dealer, she is survived by her father, Dr. David Shapiro of Palm Beach, Fla. A memorial service is to be held in New York on a date to be announced.
