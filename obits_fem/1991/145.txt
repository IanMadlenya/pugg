        Alice Cutts Wainwright, an environmentalist who wrote the charter for Friends of the Everglades and represented the Audubon Society in South Florida for almost 20 years, died after suffering a heart attack Tuesday at Mercy Hospital here. She was 83 years old.
        Mrs. Wainwright worked closely with Florida's best known environmentalist, Marjory Stoneman Douglas, to found the Everglades protection group in 1969.
        She helped to lead campaigns against a jetport in Big Cypress Swamp, home to the endangered Florida panther, and a resort city on the islands of what is now Biscayne National Park.
        As the first woman elected to the Miami City Commission, Mrs. Wainwright successfully sponsored an anti-billboard ordinance.
        She is survived by a son, John, of Washington, and two grandsons.
