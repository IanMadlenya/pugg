        Barbara Dodge Borland, a writer and editor, died on Monday at Sharon (Conn.) Hospital. She was 87 years old and lived in Salisbury, Conn.
        She died of an abdominal aneurysm, said her daughter, Diana Thompson of Cambridge, Mass.
        Mrs. Borland wrote two books and collaborated for many years on short stories and novellas with her husband, the nature writer Hal Borland, who died in 1978. In 1962, her book "The Greater Hunger" was published by Appleton-Century Press, and in 1986 "This Is the Way My Garden Grows," was published by W. W. Norton.
        She attended Oberlin College, and in the 1930's she ran writing workshops in Manhattan. For several years, she also wrote a gardening column for The Berkshire Eagle in Pittsfield, Mass.
        In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a stepson, Donal Borland of Lithonia, Ga., and two grandchildren.
