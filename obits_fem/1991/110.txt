        Claire Sullivan O'Keeffe, co-founder of Casita Maria, a Bronx service organization, died on Friday at Memorial Mission Hospital in Asheville, N.C. She was 82 years old and lived in Asheville.
        Mrs. O'Keeffe died of cancer, a spokesman for the family said.
        Casita Maria was founded in 1934 by Mrs. O'Keeffe and her sister Elizabeth as the first settlement in New York City for Hispanic people. At the time of her death, Mrs. O'Keeffe was a member of the board of Casita, which is now an agency of Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York.
        A native New Yorker, she graduated from the College of Mount St. Vincent in the Bronx, of which she was a former trustee. She received many honors for her work, including an honorary doctorate of letters from Manhattan College.
        Her husband, William C. O'Keeffe, a life insurance executive, died in 1975.
        She is survived by a sister, Elizabeth Ridder of West Palm Beach, Fla.
