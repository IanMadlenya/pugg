        Florence Cohen, president emeritus of the Volunteers for Israel, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 70 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mrs. Cohen died of cancer, a spokesman for the family said.
        She had been active with the Volunteers of Israel since its founding in 1982. The organization sends volunteers from the United States, Canada, Mexico and South America to Israel to work in a civilian capacity on military bases and in kibbutzes. It is an offshoot of an 1982 volunteer drive that was established to alleviate shortages created by the war in Lebanon.
        Mrs. Cohen, a native of Ramsey, N.J., was a registered nurse who got her nursing degree in 1943. She left nursing to raise a family but returned to the profession in the early 1970's, most recently working at the now defunct Flower and Fifth Avenue Hospitals.
        She is survived by her husband, Dr. Jules Cohen, a New York cardiologist; two sons, David, of Los Angeles, and Michael, of Scarsdale, N.Y.; a daughter, Linda, of Boston, and three grandchildren.
