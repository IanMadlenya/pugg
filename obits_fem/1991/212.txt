        Margot Tomes, an artist and illustrator of children's books, died on Tuesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 73 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She died of pancreatic cancer, a family friend said.
        Miss Tomes was an award-winning illustrator of fairy tales, historical stories in verse for children, songbooks and cookbooks. She illustrated works by Alison Lurie, Jean Fritz, Wanda Gag, Ruth Kraus and Charlotte Zolotow, among others.
        The American Library Association listed her work among notable books for children, and the American Institute of Graphic Arts included her work in a 1978-79 exhibition entitled "Communicating With Children." In 1977, "Jack and the Wonder Beans," a book she illustrated, was cited by The New York Times as one of the 10 best children's books of the year. A similar citation was given in 1984 for "If There Were Dreams to Sell."
        Miss Tomes began illustrating children's books in 1963 with Barbera Wersba's book "The Brave Balloon of Benjamin Buckley." Most recently she had been illustrating fairy tales like "The Sorcerer's Apprentice," "The Six Swans" and "The Fisherman and His Wife."
        She is survived by a sister, Jacqueline Allison of Amagansett, L.I.
