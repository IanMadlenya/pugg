        Edith Zornow, a prominent figure in the New York independent film and video community who produced the animation for "Sesame Street" and "The Electric Company" on public television, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 72 years old.
        She died of cancer, said Ellen Morgenstern, a spokeswoman for the Children's Television Workshop, the producer of "Sesame Street."
        Ms. Zornow, who was born in Brooklyn, was a producer at the New York public-television station WNDT-TV through the 1960's. There she produced "The Art of Film," a series with the critic Stanley Kauffman as host, for which Ms. Zornow won an Emmy Award in 1964.
        She joined the Children's Television Workshop in 1970, during the first season of "Sesame Street," and "helped to define the look of the show, which relies heavily on animation," Ms. Morgenstern said. Among the many prominent independent film makers with whom Ms. Zornow worked were John Hubley and Claudia Weill.  Honoring a Program
        In 1979, the Whitney Museum of American Art offered a compilation of "Sesame Street" animation and films commissioned by Ms. Zornow, and the Museum of Modern Art offered a similar program in 1989 to honor the 20th anniversary of "Sesame Street."
        In the 1970's, Ms. Zornow was the artistic director of Movies for Kids, a series of programs at Lincoln Center. She also set up and oversaw the film division at Grove Press, and supervised the theatrical release of such ground-breaking films as "Finnegans Wake," "Titticut Follies" and "I Am Curious (Yellow)."
        She is survived by a brother, Jack Zornow, of Queens, and two nephews, David Zornow and Todd Zornow, of Manhattan.
