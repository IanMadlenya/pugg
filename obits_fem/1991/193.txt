        Ethel Payne, regarded as the nation's pre-eminent black female journalist, was found dead Thursday in her Washington apartment. She was 79 years old.
        Miss Payne apparently died of natural causes on Tuesday and was discovered two days later, said her sister, Avis Johnson of San Diego.
        Miss Payne joined The Chicago Defender in 1951 as political correspondent. Based in Washington, she reported from practically every major country except the Soviet Union and Australia. She was the only black correspondent at the 1956 Bandung conference in Indonesia and covered the Nigerian civil war and the Vietnam War. From 1972 to 1978 she did commentaries on CBS radio.
        She interviewed heads of state, and entertained Vice President and Mrs. Richard M. Nixon in her Washington home.
        Miss Payne, often referred to as "the first lady of the black press," was inducted into the District of Columbia Women's Hall of Fame in 1988. She won awards from the Chicago Council on Foreign Affairs and the National Association of Black Journalists.
        She is survived by her sister.
