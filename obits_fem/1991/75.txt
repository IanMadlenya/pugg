        Janet Hobhouse, a writer and editor who earned acclaim and adherents for three stylish novels on marriage and alternative styles of living, died on Friday night at her home in Manhattan. She was 42 years old.
        She died of cancer, a family spokesman said.
        Ms. Hobhouse first won notice for a 1976 biography of Gertrude Stein, "Everybody Who Was Anybody." James Atlas, writing in The New York Times, hailed her "impressive perseverance" in showing "how Gertrude Stein made the English language an artist's medium, a sort of prose imitation of the Cubist practice of portraying an object on all sides at once."
        Other reviewers lauded Ms. Hobhouse for the liveliness, intelligence and lucidity of her novels -- "Nellie Without Hugo" (1982), "Dancing in the Dark" (1983) and "November" (1986) -- though they faulted her for focusing on her characters' self-absorption and what Michiko Kakutani of The Times termed "their endless arguing over definitions of happiness" and "attempts to turn hedonism and irresponsibility into some kind of noble quest."
        Ms. Hobhouse was a native of Manhattan who attended the Spence School and earned a bachelor's degree in English with honors at Oxford University. She was a contributing editor to Art News and wrote often for Vogue magazine.
        Her marriage to Nicholas Fraser, a journalist, ended in divorce. Survivors include her father, Henry Hobhouse of Somerset, England.
