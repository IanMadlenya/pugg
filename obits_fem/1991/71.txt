        Marcella Markham, a Brooklyn-born actress who had stage and television careers in New York and London, died on Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 68 years old and had homes in both cities.
        She died of breast cancer, her husband, Irving Palmer, said.
        Miss Markham made her first Broadway appearances in the early 1940's, playing a small role in "Vicki" and then in "Flamingo Road." In 1946, Eugene O'Neill chose her to play Cora, one of three female featured roles, in "The Iceman Cometh."
        During the play's run she married Dr. Frank Kingdon, an educator, columnist and co-chairman of the Progressive Citizens of America. The couple were blacklisted and in 1951 moved to England, where Miss Markham appeared on stage and television. She was Rudolf Nureyev's dialogue coach during the filming of "Valentino."
        She had roles in the Off Broadway production of "The Threepenny Opera" in 1954, in "Are You Now or Have You Every Been" in 1978 and in "A Conflict of Interest" in 1979. Most recently, she played the character Beatrice for two years in the American television series "General Hospital."
        Miss Markham's marriage to Dr. Kingdon ended in divorce. She is survived, in addition to Mr. Palmer, by a son, Tom Kingdon, and a grandson, Nathaniel.
