        Germaine Brée, a prolific scholar of French literature who helped introduce a generation of Americans to the work of Camus, Sartre and other modern French writers, died on Sept. 22 at her home in Winston-Salem, N.C., a spokeswoman for Wake Forest University said. Ms. Brée was 93 and had been Kenan professor of humanities at Wake Forest from 1973 until 1984.
        During World War II, while serving in the French resistance, Ms. Brée became a friend of Albert Camus. She was the author of numerous studies on the writer, including a critical biography, ''Camus,'' published in 1959. ''Germaine Brée's remarkable study is not likely to be surpassed for many years,'' Henri Peyre wrote in The New York Times Book Review at the time. Ms. Brée was also the author of ''Marcel Proust and Deliverance From Time'' (1955), ''Gide'' (1963) and ''Camus and Sartre: Crisis and Commitment'' (1972). She was a champion of modern French women writers like Monique Wittig, and was the author of ''Women Writers in France'' (1973). Ms. Brée also served as president of the Modern Language Association.
        Born in Paris, Ms. Brée spent most of her childhood in the English-speaking Channel Islands. She earned a graduate degree from the University of Paris and taught in Algeria. During World War II, she took a leave from Bryn Mawr, where she was teaching at the time, to fight for the Free French. She joined a volunteer ambulance unit, and was eventually promoted to lieutenant; she was assigned to the intelligence section of the Free French forces in Algiers. Ms. Brée received a Bronze Star and was named to the Legion of Honor for her war service.
        After the war, in 1953, Ms. Brée was appointed chairwoman of the French department at New York University's Washington Square College of Arts and Science, only the second woman in the college's history to chair a department.
        Ms. Brée is survived by a sister, Murielle Laure Radcliffe, of Wokingham, England.
