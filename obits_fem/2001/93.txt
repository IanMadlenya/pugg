        Dr. Rosa Susan Penelope Beddington, an experimental biologist whose research produced insights into the way an embryo becomes a fetus in mammals, died on May 18 in Great Tew, Oxfordshire, England. She was 45 and had formerly lived in Edinburgh and London.
        The cause was cancer, according to British press reports.
        Dr. Beddington, a skilled microsurgeon, was among the first women to be admitted to Brasenose College at Oxford to study medicine, and she soon made embryology her career. Most recently she headed the mammalian development section of the National Institute for Medical Research in London.
        Her skill in working on the tiniest embryonic cell structures under the microscope advanced scientific understanding of mammalian development. Dr. Beddington observed how such a cell determines what to grow into and what governs the process that follows.
        Dr. Beddington's survivors include her husband, the Rev. Robin A. Denniston.
