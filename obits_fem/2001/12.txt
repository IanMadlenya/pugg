        Felice Stampfle, curator of drawings and prints at the Morgan Library for nearly 40 years and editor of the scholarly journal Master Drawings, died on Sunday at her home in Kennett Square, Pa. She was 88.
        Miss Stampfle was born in Kansas City, Mo., in 1912 and received a B.A. and an M.A. in art and archaeology from Washington University in St. Louis. From 1943 to 1945 she attended Paul J. Sachs's museum training course at the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard.
        In 1945 she was hired by Belle da Costa Greene, the first director of the Morgan, to catalog the library's collection of drawings and was soon named curator of drawings and prints. Over the next 38 years she oversaw acquisitions that more than doubled the size of the library's collection and organized exhibitions that revealed its many strengths.
        Her first exhibition, in 1949, highlighted her discovery of more than 100 previously unknown sheets by Giovanni Battista Piranesi that had recently come to the Morgan from the collection of Mrs. J. P. Morgan. Beginning in 1965, in collaboration with Jacob Bean, curator of drawings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Miss Stampfle organized three seminal exhibitions of Italian drawings from New York collections, each accompanied by an authoritative catalog.
        Miss Stampfle published widely in the field of Flemish and Dutch art and was co-author to the catalog to ''Rembrandt: Experimental Etcher,'' an exhibition organized in 1969 by the Morgan Library and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.
        In 1978 she published a catalog of the Morgan's Piranesi drawings. After retiring in 1983 she continued work on a large catalog of the library's 15th- and 16th-century Netherlandish drawings and 17th- and 18th-century Flemish drawings, which appeared in 1991, at 640 pages. Her catalog on the library's 17th- and 18th-century Dutch drawings, written with Jane Shoaf Turner, is to be published in 2002.
        In 1963 Miss Stampfle founded the quarterly journal Master Drawings to promote the study and connoisseurship of drawings and remained its editor until 1983.
