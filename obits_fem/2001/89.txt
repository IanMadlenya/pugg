        Ann Tanneyhill, a counselor who was the National Urban League's director of vocational services from 1947 to 1961, died on Tuesday at a nursing home in Mashpee, Mass. She was 95.
        For more than 40 years, beginning in 1930, she was on the headquarters staff of the league, a movement dedicated to helping African-Americans gain social and economic equality by finding better jobs and owning their own homes and businesses.
        Ms. Tanneyhill had a leading part for decades in the league's efforts to increase job opportunities for black Americans. She led yearly campaigns to encourage black youngsters to get education and training.
        Ms. Tanneyhill was born in Boston and held degrees from Simmons College and Columbia. Her immediate survivors are a niece, Lucy Tanneyhill Cromwell of Mashpee; and a nephew, William Grandison Tanneyhill of Harwich, Mass.
