        Dr. Pamela Hilliard Robertson, a rookie astronaut, died on May 24 from injuries sustained two days earlier in a small-plane crash. She was 38.
        The accident took place just outside Houston, where Dr. Robertson was based at the Johnson Space Center of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
        The pilot, Roy Adams of Alvin, Tex., was said to have been practicing takeoffs and landings with Dr. Robertson, a flight instructor, when the aircraft struck trees and burst into flames. Mr. Adams, 46, suffered severe burns.
        Dr. Robertson, of Homer City, Pa., completed her training in 1998 and was scheduled to fly her first mission next year to the International Space Station as a crew-support astronaut.
        Born in Indiana, Pa., she graduated with a degree in biology from Indiana University of Pennsylvania in 1985 and from the Medical College of Pennsylvania four years later. After a residency in family medicine, she trained in space medicine at the University of Texas and at the Johnson Space Center.
        She joined the NASA Flight Medicine Clinic at the center before being selected as an astronaut. Besides being a medical doctor, she was a flight instructor with more than 1,500 hours of flight time.
        She is survived by her husband, Scott Robertson, and her mother, Ilse Hilliard of Homer City.
        Correction:  June 28, 2001, Thursday  An obituary on June 8 about an astronaut at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston misstated her given name. She was Dr. Patricia Hilliard Robertson, not Pamela.
