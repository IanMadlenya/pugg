        Lillian Kiesler, an artist, art patron and the widow of the sculptor and avant-garde architect Frederick Kiesler, died on July 25 in Manhattan. She was 91.
        Ms. Kiesler studied painting with Hans Hofmann in New York in the 1930's and was introduced to her future husband by the artist Burgoyne Diller. As a couple, they were friends with many of the leading figures in the New York art world.
        After her husband's death in 1965, Ms. Kiesler organized his work and papers and placed them at Harvard, Yale and in the Archives of American Art. In 1996 she helped establish the Frederick and Lillian Kiesler Foundation, a study center in Vienna. Four years ago she established the Austrian Frederick Kiesler Prize for a distinguished figure in architecture or the related arts. The architect Frank O. Gehry was the first recipient, the multimedia artist Judith Barry the second.
        Ms. Kiesler also performed in theater pieces by artists like Steve Buscemi and John Jesurun, often appearing with her companion, Maryette Charlton, who survives her.
        She taught art education at New York University and worked in various media throughout her life. Galerie Valerie on the Lower East Side  is planning a retrospective of her paintings, sculptures and objects.
