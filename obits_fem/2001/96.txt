        Esther Wanner Hymer, a pioneer of the international women's movement who was long active at the United Nations, died on April 4 at her home in Shrewsbury, N.J. She was 102.
        In a letter to her on her 100th birthday, Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, said: ''For half a century, as the representative of the International Federation of Business and Professional Women at the United Nations, you actively promoted the concerns of women. Your untiring efforts influenced almost all the resolutions of the General Assembly and its subsidiary bodies which affect the status of women.''
        She was born in Chicago, grew up there and graduated from the University of Wisconsin.
        Her husband, Howard G. Hymer, predeceased her.
        She is survived by a son, William, of New Jersey; and a daughter, Elizabeth Dudley, of Florida.
