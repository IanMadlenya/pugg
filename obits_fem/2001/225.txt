        Louise Steinhart Loeb, a New York benefactor of child welfare agencies and other causes, died Saturday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 86.
        Her association with the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services spanned more than four decades. In 1962, as president of its Child Development Center, she guided the center's merger with the Jewish Board of Guardians. She remained on the board of the parent organization at her death.
        Louise Steinhart was born in San Francisco and attended Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania. Her husband of 63 years, John A. Loeb, an investment banker and philanthropist, died in 1998.
        Mrs. Loeb is survived by 2 daughters, Jean Troubh and Betty Levin, both of Manhattan; 7 grandchildren, and 14 great-grandchildren.
