        Irina Bugrimova, a Russian animal tamer who taught lions to walk a tightrope in circuses, died on Feb. 20 in Moscow. She was 90.
        Ms. Bugrimova was the first Russian woman to train lions and tigers, as well as a liger, a cross between the two. She wore deerskin trousers and short boots when she performed, and appeared for 45 years with the Moscow State Circus, the Circus Humberto in Czechoslovakia and the East German State Circus, among others.
        She was born in Kharkov, Ukraine, on March 13, 1910. She was first a ballet dancer, then a speed-skating champion. She became a movie stunt woman, then a motorcycle racer. Her early lion-taming acts used motorcycles. In one stunt, a lion would run in front of her motorcycle as if in fear, while another would jump onto the rear of her seat to ride along.
        A Russian newspaper, Kultura, described how she flirted with danger by swinging on a giant swing with a lion. At the end of the routine, the two jumped off the swing together and she fed the animal a piece of meat with her teeth. Her act ended with the lions lying down as she cavorted on a carpet of cats.
        After she retired she wrote two books about the circus, and led the examination committee of the Moscow Circus School.
        Russian sources did not provide information about her survivors, but The Daily Telegraph in London said she had been married twice, to Aleksandr Buslayev, her coach and acrobatic partner, and to Konstantin Parmakyan, a dressage rider.
        Big cats attacked her many times, and it was the attack of her lion Nero in 1971 that ended her career. Despite a severely injured leg, she finished the show.
