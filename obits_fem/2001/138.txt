        Carole Honig Klein, a biographer and author of other nonfiction works, died on Monday from injuries after being struck by a car on the Upper East Side. She was 67 and lived in Manhattan.
        Ms. Klein's most recent work was ''Doris Lessing: A Biography'' (Carroll & Graf, 2000). That was preceded a year earlier by ''Doris Lessing: In This World but Not of It'' (Little, Brown).
        Much of her writing reflected her special interest in psychology, especially children, childhood experiences and relationships between parents and children. Besides her books, she wrote numerous magazine articles and book reviews.
        A native New Yorker, Ms. Klein graduated from Goddard College with a bachelor's degree in English and women's studies, followed by a master's degree in sociology and psychology. Over the years she taught English, creative writing and women's studies at Goddard, the State University of New York and New York University. She also was on the writing faculty of New School University in New York City and lectured widely on writing, women writers, women's issues and cultural history.
        Early in her career Ms. Klein tried her hand at writing comedy. In the 1950's she wrote for Steve Allen's ''Tonight'' show on NBC.
        Her book ''Aline'' was a biography of Aline Bernstein, a scenic and costume designer of the 1920's and 1930's (Harper, 1972). She was also the author of ''The Single Parent Experience'' (Walker, 1973), ''The Myth of the Happy Child'' (Harper, 1975), ''How it Feels to Be a Child'' (Harper, 1975) and ''Gramercy Park: An American Bloomsbury'' (Houghton, 1987).
        Ms. Klein is survived by a son, William S. of Washington; a daughter, Emily McGrath of Manhattan; a brother, Les Honig of California; and three grandchildren. Her husband, Ted U. Klein, died last year.
