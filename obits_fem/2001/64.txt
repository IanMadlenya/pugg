        Helen Beling, a sculptor, died on Monday at a nursing home in Bandon, Ore. She was 87.
        Ms. Beling worked in various nonobjective styles, beginning with her early wood carvings, which evoked shrouded medieval German figures. She eventually worked in stone, bronze and steel before developing an amalgam of fiberglass, reinforced resin and bronze powder, which allowed her to create large bronze sculptures that weighed very little.
        Her work has been exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and at the Whitney Museum of American Art and is in the collection of the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington. Several of her sculptures were commissioned by synagogues, including a 26-foot-long ''Exodus'' for Temple Emanu-El in Yonkers, N.Y.
        She is survived by two daughters, Victoria Tierney of Bandon and Kathe Mayer, of University Heights, Ohio; three grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.
