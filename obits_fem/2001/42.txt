        Dare Wright, a photographer and children's book author whose best-known work is ''The Lonely Doll,'' died on Jan. 25. She was 86 and lived in Manhattan.
        Ms. Wright's story about Edith, the lonely doll befriended by a pair of teddy bears, was first published in 1957 by Doubleday and illustrated with Ms. Wright's photographs of her own doll.
        Ms. Wright wrote eight more books about Edith and the bears.
        The first book never lost favor, especially with young girls, and in 1998 Houghton Mifflin reissued it.
        Born in Thornhill, Canada, Ms. Wright was the daughter of Ivan Leonard Wright, a theater critic for The Toronto Globe, and Edith Stevenson Wright, a portrait painter.
        She graduated from the Laurel School in Cleveland in 1933 and moved to New York, where she worked briefly as an actress and model before a successful career as a photographer.
        No immediate family members survive.
