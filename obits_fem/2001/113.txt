        Evalyn A. Clark, a retired Vassar College history professor who was an early member and former president of the Berkshire Conference of Women Historians, died on Sunday in Beacon, N.Y. She was 98 and lived in Poughkeepsie.
        Dr. Clark was on Vassar's faculty from 1939 to 1968, when she retired. She was associate dean of the college for 10 years, chairwoman of its history department for 6 years and the Eloise Ellery professor of history from 1962 to 1968.
        The Berkshire Conference of Women Historians began seven decades ago when women who taught history at Northeastern women's colleges were excluded from an all-male conference and started their own. By 1993 the group had 300 members, met yearly and sponsored a conference on the history of women every three years. In 1981, the conference was held at Vassar and honored Dr. Clark and Dr. Mildred Campbell, another Vassar historian.
        Evalyn Anna Clark was born on April 20, 1903, in Canandaigua, N.Y. She graduated from Vassar and received a doctorate in ancient history and classics from Johns Hopkins. Her first teaching post was at what is now Douglass College. In 1937 she switched her specialty from ancient history to modern European history.
        No immediate family members survive her.
