        Harriet Lindsay Findlay came from a family of art dealers. She was born in 1935 in Kansas City, Mo., where the original Findlay Galleries had been founded in 1870. In 1938, her father, David B. Findlay Sr., moved his family to New Canaan, Conn., and opened the David Findlay Galleries in Manhattan.
        Ms. Findlay was a graduate of the Dana Hall School, Goucher College and the Harvard-Radcliffe Business Program.
        In 1958, she went to work in her father's gallery, and became its president at his death in 1989.
        She is survived by her mother, Harriet Jones Findlay, and two brothers, David B. Findlay Jr. and H. Peter Findlay, both of whom have art galleries in Manhattan.
