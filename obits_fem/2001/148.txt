        Deborah Ann Cohen, a New York marketing executive and writer whose battle with breast cancer inspired her to assist other victims of the disease, died Tuesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 39 and lived on the Upper West Side and in Rowayton, Conn.
        Ms. Cohen, a native of Milwaukee and a Smith College graduate with an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School, was a sailor and skier. She was most recently at what is now PricewaterhouseCoopers for six years until going on medical leave.
        After her breast cancer was diagnosed in the mid-1990's she became an advocate for patients' rights and published, with Robert M. Gelfand, ''Just Get Me Through This!: The Practical Guide to Breast Cancer'' (Kensington, 2000).
        Ms. Cohen is survived by her parents, Myrna and Donald V. Cohen; her grandmothers, Belle Cohen and Edith Klein; and a brother, Daniel J., all of Milwaukee.
