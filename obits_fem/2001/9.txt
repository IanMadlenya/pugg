        Virginia O'Brien, a familiar face and voice in film musicals and comedies of the 1940's, died on Jan. 16 in Woodland Hills, a Los Angeles suburb. She was 81.
        Ms. O'Brien owed her film career to stage fright. When she made her stage debut in Los Angeles in 1940, she was too nervous to do anything but stand stock still and sing, virtually without expression. Her performance wowed the members of the audience, who thought it was a comedy routine. One of those who joined in the laughter was Louis B. Mayer, head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Ms. O'Brien was soon on her way to a screen test and an MGM contract.
        Her film credits over the next 10 years included ''Panama Hattie,'' ''Till the Clouds Roll By,'' ''Du Barry Was a Lady,'' ''Thousands Cheer,'' ''Lady Be Good'' and ''The Harvey Girls.'' She also appeared with Red Skelton in ''Merton of the Movies'' and ''The Show-Off.'' Her last film role was in the 1976 film ''Gus.''
        She is survived by three daughters, Terri O'Brien, Liz Watkins and Gale Evans; a son, John Feggo; seven grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.
