        Carmencita Romero, who performed with Katherine Dunham in her first company, the Negro Dance Group, in the mid-1930's, died on May 6 at the Florence Nightingale Nursing Home in Manhattan.
        She was 87.
        Ms. Romero, whose name was originally Lily Butler but changed her name at Ms. Dunham's request,  began her training at 18 when she studied ballet and modern dance with Ms. Dunham, later adding Caribbean ethnic dance when Ms. Dunham returned from anthropological studies in the West Indies. ''I kept thinking that it was good that Daddy didn't know what I was doing because he certainly would not have approved such dancing,'' Ms. Romero said in the American Dance Festival documentary ''Free to Dance.''
        She began performing with Ms. Dunham in the late 1930's, traveling with the group to New York, where she appeared in the musicals ''Cabin in the Sky'' and ''Carmen Jones.'' She toured the United States with the Dunham company until 1942. In the late 40's she returned home to Chicago and opened a dance school, then left to open others in Rome and Tokyo and to teach throughout Europe. She also performed in films made in Rome and London.
        Ms. Romero returned to the United States in 1981 and became an instructor at Spelman College in Atlanta.  Her last performance was in December 2000 in a program with the Joan Peters Dance Company at the Donnell Library Center of the New York Public Library in Manhattan.
        Ms. Romero also choreographed for dance companies and festivals and, in the 1960's, for the television series ''The Man From U.N.C.L.E.'' At the time of her death, she had just finished writing her memoirs, ''Soaring Spirit.''
        She is survived by a son, Raleigh Mohammed Hylton of the Bronx.
