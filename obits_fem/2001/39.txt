        Ann Colbert, the founder of Colbert Artists Management Inc., which manages the careers of classical musicians, died on Sunday. She was 95 and lived in Manhattan.
        Mrs. Colbert moved to the United States from Berlin in 1936 and started her management company with her husband, Henry Colbert, in 1948.
        She managed a distinguished roster of artists, including the singers Joan Sutherland, Elizabeth Schwarzkopf, Christa Ludwig and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau; the conductors Sir Georg Solti, Christoph von Dohnanyi and Richard Bonynge; and the musicians Jean-Pierre Rampal, Mieczyslaw Horszowski, Alfred Brendel, Janos Starker and the Juilliard String Quartet.
        When Mrs. Colbert retired in 1991, she turned over the reins of her company, which remains in business under her name, to her longtime associate, Agnes Eisenberger.
        She is survived by a daughter, Vera Chimens of Austin, Tex.; two grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.
        Correction:  March 1, 2001, Thursday  An obituary yesterday about Ann Colbert, a musicians' manager, misspelled the given name of a soprano she represented. It is Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, not Elizabeth.
