        Frances Bible, a mezzo-soprano who performed in the New York City Opera for nearly 30 years and created roles in several contemporary works, died on Jan. 29 in Hemet, Calif., where she lived. She was 82.
        Ms. Bible's warm voice and lively stage presence -- particularly in trouser roles like Cherubino in Mozart's ''Nozze di Figaro'' and Octavian in Strauss's ''Rosenkavalier'' -- made her one of City Opera's stars  when the roster also included Beverly Sills and Norman Treigle.
        Among the roles she created were  Augusta Tabor in Douglas Moore's ''Ballad of Baby Doe'' in 1956 at Central City Opera in Colorado and later at the City Opera, and Elizabeth Proctor in Robert Ward's ''Crucible,'' which had its premiere at the City Opera in 1961. She sang on the company's recordings of both roles, which have been reissued on CD.
        Ms. Bible was born in Sackets Harbor, N.Y., in 1919 (although her official biographies made her eight years younger). She studied voice at the Juilliard School and made her debut at the City Opera as the Shepherd in ''Tosca'' in 1948. Other roles included Oberon in Britten's ''Midsummer Night's Dream,'' Jocasta in Stravinsky's ''Oedipus Rex,'' Herodias in Strauss's ''Salome,'' Nicklausse in Offenbach's ''Tales of Hoffmann'' and Hänsel in ''Hänsel und Gretel.''
        She also sang in the premiere of David Tamkin's ''Dybbuk'' and in  the United States premiere (at the San Francisco Opera) of Walton's ''Troilus and Cressida.''
