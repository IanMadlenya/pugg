        Joan L. Ellenbogen, the main founder and first president of the Women's Bar Association of the State of New York, died on Tuesday at New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 59 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, said Myrna Felder, a colleague and friend.
        Ms. Ellenbogen, who was prominent in the fields of matrimonial and family law, belonged to the New York County Women's Bar Association before the state association was formed in 1980. She was its president from 1980 to 1982. The state association now has 15 chapters and more than 3,000 members.
        Ms. Ellenbogen was a partner in the Manhattan law firm of Ellenbogen & Goldstein for more than 20 years, until her death.
        A native of New York City, she held a bachelor's degree from Queens College and a law degree from New York University.
        She is survived by a sister, Leni Goodman, of Manhattan.
