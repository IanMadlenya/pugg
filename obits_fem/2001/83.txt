        Barbara Krakauer, a violinist who played chamber music and taught in New York and for nearly 25 years in summer programs in Provence, France, died on Monday. She was 69 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was breast cancer, said her husband, Dr. William Krakauer.
        Mrs. Krakauer was born in Brooklyn and studied the violin with William Jones at the Third Street Music School Settlement and with Ivan Galamian at the Juilliard School and at Meadowmount, a summer training program. She also studied chamber music at both Juilliard and the Mannes College of Music, and continued her musical studies on her own in France with Nadia Boulanger, Pierre Pasquier and Jean Pasquier.
        Beginning in 1977, Mrs. Krakauer began teaching at a series of summer master classes that were overseen by the violinist Zino Francescatti in Aix-en-Provence. After leading classes under the sponsorship of Ren√© Garmy, a luthier in Aix, Mrs. Krakauer, her husband and Jeaneane Dowis, the pianist, founded their own summer music program in Vaison-la-Romaine, France. She also taught in the preparatory and extension divisions of Mannes.
        Although she worked primarily as a teacher, Mrs. Krakauer performed as a member of the Alaria Chamber Ensemble and other groups, and in 1988, when she was 57, she presented a New York debut recital at Town Hall. The concert was devoted largely to 20th-century music, including works by Hindemith, Britten and Ursula Mamlok.
        In addition to her husband, Mrs. Krakauer is survived by a son, the clarinetist David Krakauer; a daughter, Lisa Schultz, of San Jose, Calif.; a brother, Dr. Theodore Lieberman of New York; and her mother, Jean H. Lieberman of Florida.
