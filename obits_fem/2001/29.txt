        Phyllis S. Levy, a prominent Good Housekeeping book editor who in her early publishing career helped discover Ken Kesey, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 69.
        The cause was ovarian cancer, friends said.
        A New York native, Ms. Levy graduated from Radcliffe, where she was a roommate of Rona Jaffe. Ms. Jaffe later wrote the best seller ''The Best of Everything,'' about young women in publishing, and included a character inspired by Ms. Levy.
        Ms. Levy began her career in the 1950's with Simon & Schuster and later moved to Viking Press, where she championed Mr. Kesey's ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.''
        Later she become a senior editor at McCall's, moving to Good Housekeeping in 1992.
        She is survived by her mother, Ruth Jaffe, who married Rona Jaffe's father, and a sister, Susan Chapin of Washington.
