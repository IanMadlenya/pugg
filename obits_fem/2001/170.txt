        Mara Sebrionsky Dvonch, a violinist, died on Aug. 30 at her home in Bainbridge Island, Wash. She was 87.
        Ms. Dvonch began her career in 1939 as a winner of a Walter W. Naumberg Musical Foundation Award, which carried the promise of a New York debut. That October, in her first appearance as a solo recitalist at Town Hall, she performed works by Tartini, Mozart and Glazunov in a performance that ''bespoke good taste, independent thinking and personal feeling,'' The New York Times reported.
        She later played under the conductors Leopold Stokowski, William Steinberg, Andr√© Previn and Sir Thomas Beecham, and was an associate concertmaster for the Pittsburgh Symphony from 1969-79.
        Born Bess Simon in New York, Ms. Dvonch adopted her stage name, Mara Sebrionsky, upon graduating from the Juilliard School. Sebrionsky was her parents' original surname, which they changed after immigrating to the United States from Minsk, Russia.
        She is survived by a daughter, Margaret Dvonch Swingle, of Bainbridge Island; a sister, Faye Popper, of Indianapolis; three grandchildren; and one great-granddaughter.
