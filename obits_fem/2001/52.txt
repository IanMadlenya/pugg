        Helen Smith Bevington, a poet, essayist, English professor and tireless tourist who roamed the world in search of her own Shangri-La, died on Friday at the home of her son, David, in Chicago. She was 94.
        Mrs. Bevington was a professor emeritus at Duke University, where she joined the faculty in 1943 and retired in 1976. She was the author of 12 books of poetry and essays, including her last book, published in 1996, ''The Third and Only Way: Reflections on Staying Alive.''
        A writer of light verse and memoirs that plumbed her own life, Mrs. Bevington wrote about her world travels, her romance and marriage to her husband, Merle M. Bevington, and even the small-town love affairs of her Methodist minister father.
        Her memoir ''Charley Smith's Girl'' was banned by the library in Worcester, N.Y., where she grew up. And to interviewers, Mrs. Bevington professed delight with the censure of her book, which described how her mother divorced her father for carrying on with younger female parishioners.
        ''It's a place dear to me,'' she told an interviewer. ''It's an honor to be banned there. Nobody gets banned.''
        Born in Afton, N.Y., she earned her philosophy degree from the University of Chicago and a master's degree in English from Columbia University. There she met her husband in a class in romanticism in 1927. They married, saved up $1,500 to travel and roamed the globe until they returned to New York to face the stock market crash in 1929.
        Eventually the couple settled in Durham, N.C., where her husband also joined the Duke University faculty. In addition to her son, she is survived by five grandchildren.
        In her 70's she traveled the world again, writing about her quixotic quest ''in search of something -- call it a bo tree, or Shangri-La, or earthly paradise -- which is only another name for peace itself and these days is decidedly a fool's errand.''
