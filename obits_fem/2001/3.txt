        Vera Constantinova, a princess of Russia long active in Russian-American emigre circles and charitable organizations, died on Jan. 11 at the Tolstoy Foundation Center in Valley Cottage, N.Y. She was 94.
        Princess Vera was born near St. Petersburg, a daughter of Grand Duke Constantine and Princess Elisabeth of Saxe-Altenburg. She was a great-granddaughter of Nicholas I, czar from 1825 to 1855.
        Many of her relatives were killed by the Bolsheviks in 1918, but she and her mother escaped to Sweden. Eventually they settled in Altenburg, seat of the duchy of Saxe-Altenburg, in Thuringia, eastern Germany.
        At the end of World War II, Princess Vera fled again before the advancing Soviet Army. She came to the United States in 1951 to live in New York and work for organizations like the Tolstoy Foundation, which was formed to help Russian refugees.
        Princess Vera never married.
