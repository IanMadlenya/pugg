        Isadora Wexler Quinlan, the executive director of the Books for Kids Foundation, a nonprofit literacy organization, died on Saturday at New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 63 and lived in Manhattan and Guilford, Conn.
        The cause was lung cancer, said her husband, Robert J. Quinlan.
        Mrs. Quinlan, known as Liz, was a trustee of Vassar College and president of its alumni association.
        Over the years she was also director of public relations and organizational development of the Association of International Junior Leagues, senior warden of the Church of the Holy Trinity on the Upper East Side, and on the board of the Foreign Policy Association.
