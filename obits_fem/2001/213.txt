        Ruth Limmer, an authority on the poet Louise Bogan, died on Oct. 31 at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.
        The cause was a brain inflammation, said David Bauer, a friend.
        Ms. Limmer edited three volumes of Bogan's writing, including her autobiographical ''Journey Around My Room.'' She was the executor of Bogan's literary estate and a consultant to the Louise Bogan Charitable Trust.
        Ms. Limmer also helped to develop the Lower East Side Tenement Museum on Orchard Street and edited its research newsletter, Tenement Times, for several years.
        Born in Manhattan, Ms. Limmer received a bachelor's degree from Brooklyn College and a master's degree in English and writing from Mills College in Oakland, Calif.
        She became a professor of English and writing at Western College for Women in Oxford, Ohio, where she taught for 20 years. In 1974 she became the chairwoman of the English department at Goucher College in Towson, Md.
        Later she moved to Washington to work at the Office of Policy Analysis at the invitation of Donna E. Shalala, then an assistant secretary of Housing and Urban Development. When Ms. Shalala was named president of Hunter College in New York, she brought Ms. Limmer to her staff.
        After her retirement, Ms. Limmer continued to work as a freelance editor. Her projects included ''Six Heritage Tours of the Lower East Side,'' published by the New York University Press in 1997.
        There are no immediate survivors.
