        Mitzi Myers, an internationally recognized authority on children's literature and a longtime lecturer at the University of California at Los Angeles, died on Nov. 5 at her temporary residence in Anaheim Hills, Calif. She was 62.
        The cause was complications from pneumonia she contracted after a fire last year at her permanent home in Fullerton, Calif., said Patsy Myers, her sister.
        Dr. Myers had been on medical leave from the university after the fire on Aug. 13, 2000, which left her with second- and third-degree burns and respiratory problems. She was injured when she repeatedly entered her burning home to save her renowned 35,000-volume library. Despite her efforts, most of the books were destroyed.
        Dr. Myers, who once called herself ''the grand old queen of the footnote,'' published more than 75 scholarly articles. She was an editor of the forthcoming Norton Anthology of Children's Literature and contributed entries on children's literature to the Encylopedia Americana and the Cambridge Companion to Children's Literature.
        At U.C.L.A., Dr. Myers taught courses on writing as well as on the history of children's literature.
        In a paper presented to the Modern Language Association, she urged fellow scholars to study not only the texts of children's books but also the rips, dirt, spills, uncensored comments, drawings, scribbles, rude jokes and missing pages created by the readers because ''in these 'defacements' we discover the hidden history of childhood.''
        Dr. Myers was born on Oct. 9, 1939, in Sulphur Springs, Tex. She received bachelor's and master's degrees from East Texas State University and a Ph.D. from Rice University in Houston.
        Dr. Myers's husband, Dennis Hengeveld, died in 1983. She is survived by her sister, of San Francisco.
