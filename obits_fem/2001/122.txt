        Dorothy Brockway Osborne, a former headmistress of the Spence School, a Manhattan private school for girls, died on Tuesday at her home in Concord, N.H. She was 103.
        She headed Spence from 1936 until 1952. Founded in 1892, the school has been at 22 East 91st Street since 1929.
        Under Mrs. Osborne, Spence's enrollment grew from about 200 to about 300 (it is 587 now), and the school became a college preparatory institution. While she was headmistress, she also became president of the Guild of Independent Schools of New York, vice president of the New York State Association of Independent Schools and a trustee of Barnard and of what is now Collegiate School, a boys' school in Manhattan.
        Her husband, Harold S. Osborne, died in 1985.
        A native New Yorker, she graduated from Barnard, received a master's degree in mathematics from Teachers College at Columbia and taught mathematics at three other schools in addition to Spence before becoming its headmistress.
        Surviving are two daughters, Margaret McLane of Fond du Lac, Wis., and Polly Smith of Tiburon, Calif.; nine grandchildren; and 19 great-grandchildren.
