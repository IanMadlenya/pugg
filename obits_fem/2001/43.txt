        Mirra Ginsberg, a noted translator of works by Dostoyevsky, Mikhail Bulgakov and Isaac Bashevis Singer, died on Dec. 26 on Long Island. She was 91.
        Born in Russia on June 10, 1909, Ms. Ginsberg moved with her family to Canada and then to the United States, said her cousin, Barbara Franchi.
        In the United States, Ms. Ginsberg, who was self-educated, soon specialized in translating Russian and Yiddish works into English. She translated some of the early works of Singer.
        Her other translations included ''The Master and Margarita'' by Bulgakov (Grove Press, 1967); ''Notes From the Underground'' by Dostoyevsky (Bantam, 1974); and ''Soviet Heretic: Essays by Yevgeny Zamyatin'' (University of Chicago Press, 1970) and ''The Fatal Eggs and Other Soviet Satire, 1918-1963'' (Grove Press, 1964-65), both of which she also edited.
        Correction:  February 13, 2001, Tuesday  An obituary last Tuesday about a translator of works by Dostoyevsky, Mikhail Bulgakov and Isaac Ba shevis Singer misspelled her surname. She was Mirra Ginsburg, not Ginsberg.
