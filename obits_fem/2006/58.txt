        Gretchen Rau, a noted Hollywood set decorator who earned an Academy Award last month for her work on ''Memoirs of a Geisha,'' died on March 29 at her home in Northport, N.Y. She was 66.
        The cause was a brain tumor, her family said.
        Lavishly decorated, ''Memoirs of a Geisha'' evoked the world of Japan in the 1930's and 40's through rice-paper screens, oil lamps and other traditional artifacts. Ms. Rau, who shared the Oscar with John Myhre, was too ill to attend the ceremony.
        Her other credits -- more than 30 films in all -- include ''The Shipping News'' (2001), ''The Horse Whisperer'' (1998), ''What's Eating Gilbert Grape'' (1993), ''A River Runs Through It'' (1992), ''Mississippi Burning'' (1988), ''Crocodile Dundee'' (1986) and ''Once Upon a Time in America'' (1984).
        With Lilly Kilvert, Ms. Rau was nominated for an Oscar for ''The Last Samurai'' in 2003.
        Gretchen Rau was born in New Orleans on July 6, 1939. After moving to New York in 1966, she began her career as a property master with a company that produced television commercials.
        Ms. Rau, who was divorced, is survived by three sons, Taylor Pattison, George Pattison and Jean-Paul Menard, all of Northport; two daughters, Anne Pattison of London and Stephanie Pattison of Wellington, Fla.; a sister, Roli, and a brother, Forest, both of Louisiana; and four grandchildren.
        Her last film, ''The Good Shepherd,'' directed by Robert De Niro, is scheduled for release this year.
