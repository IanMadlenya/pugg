        Beth Fallon, a political reporter and columnist whose thrice-weekly columns in The Daily News and The New York Post brought an irreverent eye to city life in the 1970's and 80's, died Saturday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 64.
        She had been in declining health for more than a decade, said her husband, Maurice Carroll.
        Ms. Fallon became a prominent voice in New York City journalism at a time when the city's news columns were dominated by male writers and editors.
        She was hired by The Daily News in 1974 and was later appointed the paper's City Hall bureau chief, making her the first woman to hold that position in New York for any news organization.
        In an era of fiscal crisis and political unrest, she was an indomitable presence at City Hall. When she was married, in 1976, it was to Mr. Carroll, then a reporter covering politics for The New York Times, in a ceremony presided over by Mayor Abraham D. Beame in City Hall's ceremonial Blue Room.
        As a columnist for The Daily News, and later for The Post, she had few qualms about needling those in power. One of her subjects in the late 1970's was Gov. Hugh L. Carey, over his ultimately futile attempt to have the state condemn property neighboring his own on Shelter Island. Mr. Carey wanted to prevent a neighbor from building on the land.
        A frequent subject of her later columns was George Steinbrenner. Mr. Carroll, who now heads the Quinnipiac University Poll, said that Ms. Fallon liked Mr. Steinbrenner, and was invited more than once to watch the Yankees from his box seat, but that her columns ''needled him about his grandiosity.''
        Born Nov. 23, 1941, in Hartford, Ms. Fallon graduated from St. Elizabeth's College there and worked as travel editor of The Hartford Times before joining The Daily News. Late in her career, she moved from newspapers to television, providing commentary on Channel 9.
        She is survived by Mr. Carroll.
