        Shoshana Damari, one of Israel's most popular singers, with a career dating back to the founding of the state, died on Tuesday in Tel Aviv. She was 83.
        The cause was complications of pneumonia, her family said. Her signature song, ''Anemones,'' was played at her hospital bedside in her dying moments as family and friends sang along, they said.
        Born in Yemen, Ms. Damari came to Israel at age 2. She was best known for her nationalist anthems, popular with the Israeli military, and was deeply associated with the generation of the 1948-49 war. Her rendition of that war's song, ''Friendship,'' was the favorite of Yitzhak Rabin, and she sang it at his memorial service after his assassination.
        In 1988 she was awarded the state's most prestigious honor, the Israel Prize. She sang songs written by some of Israel's greatest poets.
        President Moshe Katsav led the tributes to her role in expressing Israel's national identity, describing her as a woman who ''united the country and who conveyed hope and optimism.'' The defense minister, Shaul Mofaz, said her ''songs would remain in the hearts of soldiers for years to come,'' while the acting prime minister, Ehud Olmert, said in a statement: ''Her cultural achievements will not be forgotten, neither will the legacy that she has bequeathed to entire generations who grew up on -- and will yet grow up on -- her songs. We will always remember her as the voice of the nation.''
        At 16 she married her manager, Shlomo Bushmi, who died 19 years ago. She is survived by her daughter, Navah, of Canada, according to the Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharonot.
