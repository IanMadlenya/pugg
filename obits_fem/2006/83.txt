        Leslie Hansen Kopp, a dance and music archivist, died on May 27 in Manhattan. She was 53.
        The cause was breast cancer, said George Boziwick, a friend and the chief of the music division at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center.
        Born in Newport News, Va., Ms. Kopp received a master's degree in musicology from Temple University. In 1988, with Michael Scherker, she founded Preserve Inc., an organization that taught performing arts organizations and interested people how to create and maintain archives, and conducted workshops nationwide. She became its director.
        In 1998 Preserve sponsored the Decade of Dance Preservation Symposium, a conference that featured panels of dancers, scholars, archivists, librarians and computer technicians. Ms. Kopp also worked with the Dia Art Foundation, the Dance Notation Bureau, the New York State Historical Documents Inventory and the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Musical Instrument Collection.
        In 1995 she received the Mid Atlantic Regional Archives Conference's Arline Custer Memorial Award for her publication ''Dance Archives: A Practical Manual for Documenting and Preserving the Ephemeral Art.''
        Ms. Kopp is survived by her companion, Carolynn Jennings, and their daughter, Hanna, both of New York City.
