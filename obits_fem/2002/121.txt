        Phyllis Weisbart Litoff, co-artistic director of the Belleayre Music Festival in Highmount, N.Y., for the last nine years, died on July 7 at her home in Highmount. She was 63.
        The cause was brain cancer, the festival announced.
        She and her husband, Mel, had been part-time residents of Highmount for 17 years. They also had homes in New York City and Singer Island, Fla.
        After attending the initial Belleayre concert 11 years ago, she and her husband volunteered to be the artistic directors and expand the presentation into an annual summer series. They eventually became paid staff members. The festival became a prominent event that drew some of the best-known names in jazz, Broadway, classical and pop music.
        She was born on Dec. 3, 1938, in New York. A graduate of the High School of Music and Art, she performed as a singer in the Catskills, in theater and at clubs and concerts.
        In addition to her husband, she is survived by four sons, Steven, of Ossining, N.Y.; Michael, of Blaine Island, Me.; David, of Lafayette, Colo.; and Erich, of Los Angeles; and a daughter, Stacey Mann, also of Los Angeles.
