        Pauline Tish, a modern-dance teacher who studied and performed with some of the pioneers of American modern dance, died on April 1 in Manhattan. She was 89 and lived in Manhattan.
        A native New Yorker, Ms. Tish attended Hunter College and New York University. During the 1930's, she studied with leaders of modern dance like Martha Graham, Louis Horst, Charles Weidman and Doris Humphrey, and was especially influenced by the choreography of Helen Tamiris.
        As a member of the Federal Theater Dance Project, a division of the Works Progress Administration, Ms. Tish performed in several productions by Tamiris. In recent years she helped reconstruct some of Tamiris's works.
        Ms. Tish founded the dance department at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn in 1956. She was always interested in new trends, and recruited to her faculty several experimental dancers and dance-composition teachers, including Yvonne Rainer, Robert Ellis Dunn, James Cunningham and Tina Croll.
        After retiring from Pratt in 1977, Ms. Tish occasionally taught dance history part time there and at Brooklyn and Hunter Colleges, and she was active in dance organizations including the American Dance Guild, which she had served as president, and the Dance Films Association.
        Ms. Tish is survived by her daughter, Frances Tish, and a sister, Diana Durkin, both of Manhattan.
