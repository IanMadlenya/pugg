        Meredith Baylis, a prominent teacher at the Joffrey Ballet School in New York for 15 years and a former member of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, died on July 26 in Burbank, Calif. She was 72 and lived in Los Angeles.
        The cause was complications after heart surgery, said Leslie Aqua Viva Shulman, a friend.
        Although Ms. Baylis, born in Burbank, was an American of Scottish-Irish descent, she was related to one of the leaders of British theater. Lilian Baylis, her great-aunt, was founder of the Old Vic Theater in London.
        Meredith Baylis studied ballet in Los Angeles and New York, toured with the national company of ''Carousel'' after graduating from high school and joined the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1951. She remained with the company until 1962, when it disbanded.
        In addition to dancing solo roles in classical and modern works, while on tour she was an assistant to the company's director, Sergei J. Denham. She helped rehearse ballets, made suggestions about casting, sent financial reports back to Denham's New York office and kept the company's official travel diary.
        Ms. Baylis joined the faculty of the Joffrey School (first called the American Ballet Center) in 1969, and soon established herself as one of its leading teachers. She directed the Joffrey Summer Program for students from around the country. She left the Joffrey School in 1984 to care for her father in Los Angeles.
        She directed her own ballet school in Los Angeles from 1990 to 2000 and also taught at the schools of Natalia Clare and Anna Cheselka.
        She is survived by a brother, Richard Baylis of Huntington Beach, Calif.
