        Davida S. Herwitz, who built a major collection of modern art from India with her husband, Chester, died on Sunday in a hospital in Rockville, Md. She was 71 and lived in Worcester, Mass.
        The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease, her family said.
        The Herwitzes first visited India in 1961, and in many trips there amassed more than 3,000 works.
        Paintings from the Herwitz collection have been exhibited at the Tate Gallery in London, the Pompidou Center in Paris, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Worcester Art Museum and the Grey Gallery in Manhattan.
        Mr. Herwitz, owner of a leather company, died in 1999, and a year later Mrs. Herwitz donated some 850 works by 20th-century Indian artists from their collection -- valued at $6 million -- to the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Mass. The gift also included a library, an archive of related papers, and $1 million.
        Mrs. Herwitz graduated from Simmons College in Boston and was a trustee of the Connecticut Opera and the Worcester Art Museum.
        She is survived by her sons Daniel, of Durban, South Africa; Peter, of New York City; and Thomas, of Bethesda, Md.
