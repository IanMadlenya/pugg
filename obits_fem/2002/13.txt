        Raji Jallepalli-Reiss, a chef credited with originating the fusion of classic French and Indian cuisines, died on Jan. 27 at her home in Memphis. She was 52.
        The cause was cancer, according to The Commercial Appeal of Memphis.
        As the executive chef of the Indian restaurant Tamarind on East 22nd Street in Manhattan, she combined essential elements of classic French cuisine with Indian ingredients and spices, thereby touching off what has been called the French-Indian fusion movement in gastronomy.
        Tamarind opened on Jan. 1, 2001. Its owner, Avtar Walia, said that Ms. Jallepalli-Reiss came to Tamarind regularly from Memphis, where she owned Restaurant Raji.
        The restaurant critic William Grimes gave Tamarind a rating of two stars in reviewing it in The New York Times in April 2001. He called the restaurant, with its multiregional menu, ''a clear-cut victory for the cause of Indian food.''
        He said the chef had ''helped develop a menu that treats Indian cuisine as a genuine culinary language, like French, able to assimilate nontraditional ingredients and techniques.''
        Ms. Jallepalli-Reiss was a co-author, with Judith Choate, of a cookbook, ''Raji Cuisine: Indian Flavors, French Passion'' (Harper Collins, 2000).
        She was born in India, and came to the United States in 1969.
        Her marriage to Dr. Panduranga Jallepalli ended in divorce. She is survived by her second husband, Dr. Louis Reiss; two sons, Dr. Prasad Jallepalli and Satish Jallepalli; two stepdaughters, Shauna and Stephanie Reiss; her mother, Radha Rampalli; and three sisters, Padma, Sita and Vijayanti Rampalli.
