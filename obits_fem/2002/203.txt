        Mary T. Kinnear, a former member of the Smithsonian National Board and a trustee of the Ethel Walker School in Simsbury, Conn., died on Saturday at her home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 73.
        The cause was lung cancer, her family said.
        Mrs. Kinnear was the wife of James W. Kinnear, former president and chief executive of Texaco and chairman of the Metropolitan Opera who will step down later this month and become honorary chairman.
        Mrs. Kinnear was a graduate of the Ethel Walker School and attended Sarah Lawrence College.
        Besides her husband, Mrs. Kinnear is survived by two daughters, Robin Kinnear of Birmingham, Ala., and Susan Kinnear Neul of Summit, N.J.; two sons, J. Wesley Kinnear IV of Mill Valley, Calif., and William Mitchell Kinnear of Wilmette, Ill.; and seven grandchildren.
