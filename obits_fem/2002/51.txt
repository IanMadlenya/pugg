        Peggy Hewett, a Broadway actress, died on March 1 at her home in Southampton, N.Y. She was 56.
        The cause was leukemia, her family said.
        Ms. Hewett became known in the 1980's when she starred in ''A Day in Hollywood/A Night in the Ukraine'' and ''Olympus on My Mind,'' and had a popular cabaret act.
        She was a relative newcomer to the stage when Tommy Tune chose her for the starring role in ''A Day in Hollywood'' in 1980. Her only previous theater experience had been as a chorus member in the 1969 musical ''Jimmy.''
        In ''A Day in Hollywood'' she played Mme. Pavlenko, a prim dowager modeled after Margaret Dumont -- the Marx Brothers' high-society nemesis -- who nonetheless tap danced and played the saxophone. The role led to similar ones, including Charis, a nagging wife, in ''Olympus on My Mind'' in 1986.
        ''I play ugly old broads,'' she told an interviewer while she was in ''Olympus.'' ''I haven't played anybody under 60 in years.''
        Ms. Hewett left New York for Southern California in the early 90's, said Bonnie Goebert, her companion, and she performed there in a few shows with minor companies. She worked as a real estate agent there as well, Ms. Goebert said. She moved back to Southampton almost two years ago.
        Besides Ms. Goebert, she is survived by her mother, Sarah Hewett, of Lake Charles, La., and her brother, Barton Hewett, of Palm Springs, Calif.
