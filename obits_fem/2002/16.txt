        Beatrice Seckler, a lead dancer with Doris Humphrey and Charles Weidman in the 1930's and early 40's and a longtime teacher of the Humphrey-Weidman modern-dance technique, died on Dec. 28 at the Actors' Fund Residence in Englewood, N.J. She was 91.
        Born in Brooklyn, Ms. Seckler studied dance with Michio Ito, Angel Cansino and Yeichi Nimura, as well as with Humphrey and Weidman. She performed with the Humphrey-Weidman troupe, then called Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman & Company, from 1935 to 1942, then went on to dance at the Roxy Theater from 1942 to 1945, where she and Lee Sherman were featured dancers in revues that accompanied movie screenings.
        Ms. Seckler toured with José Limón and Dorothy Bird in 1945 and 1946 and performed with the companies of Sophie Maslow and Anna Sokolow. She also created roles in modern-dance signature works of the time, among them ''New Dance,'' ''With My Red Fires,'' ''Theater Piece'' and ''Passacaglia and Fugue in C Minor,'' all by Humphrey; Weidman's ''Flickers'' and ''Lynchtown''; and Sokolow's ''Lyric Suite'' and ''Rooms.'' Ms. Seckler also choreographed occasionally, including a series of solos for Humphrey.
        She was a leading teacher of the Humphrey-Weidman technique at the New Dance Group for many years, starting in 1948. From 1976 to 1996, she was the co-director of the Deborah Carr Theater Dance Ensemble, whose repertory included works by Humphrey and Weidman, where she coached the performers on the Humphrey-Weidman style and dances.
        Ms. Seckler is survived by her nephew, David Berkley, of Summit, N.J.
