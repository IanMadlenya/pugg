        Mary Knowles Fritchey, whose fund-raising and support for the Kennedy Center, the Phillips Collection and other cultural institutions helped make Washington a center for the arts, died on July 9 at her home in Washington. She was 90.
        In 1965, Ms. Fritchey became one of the first fund-raisers for the Kennedy Center, which now presents more than 3,300 arts performances a year. She was a trustee at the Phillips Collection, a modern art museum in Washington. She helped guide its transition from a small family museum to a larger public one with a professional staff.
        She was on the board of the Shakespeare Theater in Washington and raised money for the Anacostia Neighborhood Museum, which is part of the Smithsonian Institution.
        Her first husband, Frank Gardiner Wisner, a former deputy director at the Central Intelligence Agency, died in 1965. In 1975, she married Clayton Willis Fritchey, a newspaper columnist, who died last year.
        Ms. Fritchey is survived by three sons, Graham Wisner of Great Falls, Va., Ellis Wisner of Washington, Frank Wisner of New York City, a former ambassador to Zambia, Egypt, India and the Philippines; a daughter, Elizabeth Wisner Hazard of Belgrade, Me.; seven grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.
