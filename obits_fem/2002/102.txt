        Sophie G. Untermeyer, a longtime supporter and key staff member of the New York Philharmonic and a noted sportswoman, died on Saturday at the Jewish Home and Hospital in Manhattan. She was 92 and had lived on the Upper East Side.
        She was on the Philharmonic's board of directors from 1970 to 1997. She was fund-raising director from 1965 to 1980 and director of Friends of the Philharmonic, a fund-raising group, from 1958 to 1980. She did volunteer work as well as paid work for the Philharmonic.
        Mrs. Untermeyer was associate chairman of the Lewisohn Stadium Concerts in the 1950's and 60's. Her association with the concerts began when she was in her 30's and started assisting her mother, Minnie Guggenheimer, who had founded and run the concerts. After her mother's death in 1966, Mrs. Untermeyer took over.
        Mrs. Untermeyer played tennis and polo, and after hurting a knee playing polo, took up golf. She won the New York Women's Metropolitan Golf Championship eight times.
        She was born in Manhattan and graduated from the Lincoln School.
        Her 1935 marriage to Dewitt E. Untermeyer ended in divorce in 1943.
        She is survived by two nephews, Charles S. Guggenheimer and Randolph Guggenheimer Jr., both of Manhattan.
