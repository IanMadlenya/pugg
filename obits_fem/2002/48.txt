        Isabelle Holland, a prolific writer of fiction for young adults and Gothic mystery novels, died on Feb. 9 at New York Presbyterian Hospital. She was 81.
        Ms. Holland's fiction for teenagers often focused on serious and controversial topics like rape, obesity, death and homosexuality. Her novel  ''The Man Without a Face'' (1972) was the basis for the 1993 Mel Gibson film of the same name. Set in Maine, the book focuses on the friendship of a fatherless teenager and a reclusive, disfigured teacher who tutors him for the entrance exam to a private school where he hopes to escape from a troubled home life; it is implied that he has a homosexual encounter with his mentor.
        Ms. Holland was born on June 16, 1920, in Basel, Switzerland, where her father was the American consul. She spent her early years in Guatemala City and Liverpool, England, and moved to America in 1940 after war broke out. She earned a bachelor's degree from Tulane University in 1942 and settled in New York, where she held various publishing jobs. One of the first books she worked on as a publicity director at Delacorte Press was ''To Kill a  Mockingbird'' by Harper Lee, with whom she began a lifelong friendship.
        Ms. Holland wrote more than 50  books but was not published until her late 40's. She was still at work at the time of her death.
        She is survived by her brother, Philip Holland, of Jacksonville, Fla.
        Correction:  March 14, 2002, Thursday  An obituary on Saturday about Isabelle Holland, an author of young adult and gothic mystery novels, misidentified the publishing house where she managed publicity for ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' by Harper Lee. It was the J. B. Lippincott Company, not Delacorte Press.
