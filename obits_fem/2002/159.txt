        Bernice Chesler, the author of widely read guidebooks about American bed-and-breakfast inns, died on Sept. 4 at her home in Newton, Mass. She was 69.
        The cause was cancer, said a friend, Lynda Morgenroth.
        Mrs. Chesler's work won praise around the country. Her four bed-and-breakfast guidebooks were republished in at least a dozen revised editions.
        The books ''created the template for inn guidebooks nationwide,'' The Richmond Times-Dispatch said in 1999, adding, ''In addition to giving the facts about an inn's address and rates,'' she sought to portray ''the personality of the hosts and their house.''
        Her books were ''Bernice Chesler's Bed & Breakfast in New England'' (1998, Chronicle), ''Bernice Chesler's Bed & Breakfast in the Mid-Atlantic States'' (1997), ''Bed & Breakfast in the Northeast'' (1983) and ''Bed & Breakfast Coast to Coast'' (1986).
        She was born Bernice Goldberg in Fall River, Mass., and held a bachelor's degree from Northeastern University. Surviving are her husband, David Alan Chesler; two sons, Stanford, of Newton, Mass. and Mark, of Oberlin, Ohio; a daughter, Lisa Winsor of Mattapoisett, Mass.; and a grandchild.
