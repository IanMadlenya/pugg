        Quita Brodhead, a painter of colorful figurative and abstract paintings for more than 80 years, died on Sept. 4 in Bryn Mawr, Pa. She was 101 and lived in Wayne, Pa.
        She had a vibrant style that continued to evolve through her life. Her early work was mostly nudes and still lifes, influenced by CÃ©zanne and Matisse. But starting in the 1950's her work became more abstract but kept her signature bright colors.
        Ms. Brodhead was born Marie Waggaman Berl on March 5, 1901, and studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Her first New York show was in 1938. Her father used to call her Mariequita -- Little Marie -- hence her nickname.
        Her work is in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Delaware Art Museum, the Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute in Utica, N.Y., and other museums. Her last show, at a college, closed on Aug. 30.
        She is survived by three children, Edith Good of Charlottesville, Va.; Truxtun Brodhead of Niantic, Conn.; and Charles Brodhead of Alexandria, Va.; seven grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. Her marriage to Truxtun Read Brodhead ended in divorce.
        Grace Glueck wrote in The New York Times of Ms. Brodhead's centenary exhibition: ''The gifts of long life and the talent to live it rewardingly do not go to many. Ms. Brodhead is quite simply a phenomenon.''
