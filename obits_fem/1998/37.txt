        Marje Fields, a longtime talent agent who was a pioneer in placing well-known actors in television commercials, died on Jan. 27 at her home in Manhattan. She was 77.
        Among the clients represented at one time by her agency, Marje Fields Inc., were John Travolta, Ted Danson, Nancy Walker, Edward Hermann, Barry Bostwick and Hal Linden. While Ms. Fields, whose married name was Karp, concentrated on the television advertising, side of the business, others in her office also represented some of their clients for theatrical productions.
        While president of the National Association of Talent Representatives, Ms. Fields led a three-year legal battle to end the licensing of talent agents by actors' unions and the payment of franchise fees by agents to the unions.
        That effort eventually led to a 1981 ruling by the United States Supreme Court. The union practice of requiring members to work only for talent agents the union had licensed was deemed to be constitutional, and not a violation of anti-trust laws, as Ms. Fields's group had argued.
        But the justices were split on the legality of the franchise fees, which unions -- Actors' Equity, the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio artists -- had required licensed agents to pay to them. The fees were eventually discontinued by the unions.
        Ms. Fields began her career at the Air Features agency, later moving to the Charles B. Tranum Agency, where she became a leader in the then-new concept of placing famous actors in television commercials.
        In 1971, she formed her own agency, which closed in 1994 when she retired. She married Oscar Karp, owner of Oscar's Salt of the Sea restaurant in Manhattan, in 1983. Mr. Karp died in 1986.
