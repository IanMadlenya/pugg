        Anna Jane Harrison, an emeritus professor of chemistry at Mount Holyoke College and the first woman to be president of the 150,000-member American Chemical Society, died on Aug. 8 at Holyoke Hospital. She was 85 and lived in nearby South Hadley, Mass.
        The cause was a stroke, the college said.
        Dr. Harrison was born on a farm in Benton City, Mo. Her early education was in a one-room country school, and she returned to teach there for two years after graduating from the University of Missouri in 1933.
        She then earned an M.A. and a Ph.D. in physical chemistry, also at Missouri, and started her college teaching career at Sophie Newcomb College of Tulane University in 1940.
        She joined the faculty at Mount Holyoke College as an assistant professor in 1945, rose to professor in 1950 and headed the department of chemistry from 1960 to 1966.
        She became the William R. Kenan Jr. Professor of Chemistry in 1976 and held that post until she retired in 1979.
        Dr. Harrison received 20 honorary degrees and won awards from the American Chemical Society in 1977 and 1982 for her contributions as a teacher.
        She was active in the society for 62 years and became its president, for a one-year term, in 1978.
        Dr. Harrison also served on the National Science Board in the 1970's.
        In addition, she was a longtime board member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and in 1984 became its president.
        She has no immediate survivors.
