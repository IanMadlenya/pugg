        Betsy Carden, a former dance teacher at Brooklyn College and a leader in American college dance, died on May 5 at her home in Chapel Hill, N.C. She was 68.
        She died of cancer, said her family.
        Born in Danville, Va., and educated at Mary Washington College of the University of Virginia and at New York University, Ms. Carden taught at Radford College in Virginia before coming to Brooklyn College in 1955. She was head of the Brooklyn College dance department when she retired in 1986.
        Believing that colleges need to foster dance as a performing art, she was active in the American College Dance Festival Association from 1979 to 1990. She originated its scholarship program, helped develop its choreography series and supervised many college dance festivals. At her retirement from the association, she was its first executive secretary. She also was president of the American Dance Guild, 1973-75.
        She is survived by her husband, John, of Chapel Hill; two sisters, Ardelle Morgan Carter of Lake Wales, Fla., and Mary Jane Martin Bright of Kinston, N.C., and five brothers, W. Ray Martin of Tucson, Ariz., and James T. Morgan, George G. Martin Jr., Robert H. Martin and M. Gene Martin, all of Danville, Va.
