        Nena Manach Goodman, an artist, patron of the arts and philanthropist, died yesterday at United Hospital in Port Chester, N.Y. She was 88 and lived in Rye, N.Y.
        Mrs. Goodman was the widow of Andrew Goodman, owner and chairman of Bergdorf Goodman in the 1950's and 60's. Mr. Goodman, the son of Edwin Goodman, the founder of the store, died in 1993 at the age of 86.
        An accomplished painter, Mrs. Goodman for many years managed Nena's Choice Gallery at Bergdorf Goodman and exhibited the work of promising young artists. From time to time she also showed and sold her own pictures.
        She specialized in miniatures, oils of flowers or New York City buildings, that were not much bigger than one inch by one inch. They proved popular, and she sold hundreds at hundreds of dollars apiece.
        Nena Manach was born in Tembleque, Spain, and grew up in Cuba, the only sister of Jorge Manach, an author and a biographer of Jose Marti. She met Andrew Goodman in 1935, and for much of their 56 years of marriage they had homes in Rye and on the top floor of the flagship store at Fifth Avenue and 58th Street.
        Since the Cuban Revolution she assisted Cuban immigrants in Miami and New York. She was also on the boards of the International Rescue Committee and the Alcoholism Center of Greater New York.
        She is survived by 3 daughters, Vivien Malloy of Waccabuc, N.Y.; Mary Ann Quinson of Manhattan, and Pamela Lichty of Honolulu; a son, Edwin, of Manhattan; 13 grandchildren, and 9 great-grandchildren.
