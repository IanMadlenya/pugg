        Beatrice Snyder, a co-founder and former executive of Biocraft Laboratories, a maker of generic pharmaceuticals, died June 21 at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 74 and lived in Cliffside Park, N.J.
        The cause of death was complications from emphysema, said Harold Snyder, her husband.
        The Snyders started Biocraft Laboratories, which specialized in generic antibiotics, in Fair Lawn, N.J., in 1964. Ms. Snyder, who headed the financial operations of the company and was responsible for developing the inventory system, held the titles of senior vice president and secretary. Mr. Snyder was chairman and chief executive. Eventually, all three of the couple's children worked in the company.
        Biocraft, which Mr. Snyder said became the first generic pharmaceutical company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1985, had annual sales of $150 million when it was bought by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries in 1996. Ms. Snyder was elected to the Teva board.
        Ms. Snyder graduated from Hunter College in 1945 with a bachelor's degree in statistics.
        In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Beryl Snyder Trost, and two sons, Brian and Jay, all of New York, and five grandchildren.
