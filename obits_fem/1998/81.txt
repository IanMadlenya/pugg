        Kathleen F. Connelly, a corporate crisis and public relations executive, died Sunday while vacationing in the Virgin Islands. She was 49.
        The cause was complications from breast cancer, according to a spokesman for the Dilenschneider Group, the public relations firm in which Ms. Connelly was a principal.
        Ms. Connelly was a bond trader and portfolio manager at Continental Bank in Chicago when Robert Dilenschneider, who had been sent by Hill & Knowlton to open its Chicago office in 1979, made her his first hire. The extraordinary success that followed propelled Mr. Dilenschneider to the top of Hill & Knowlton, the world's largest public relations firm, and Ms. Connelly rose to become its first female executive vice president and head of worldwide business development.
        When Mr. Dilenschneider set up his new firm in 1991, Ms. Connelly became a co-founder and head of the Chicago office. Two years ago, she advised Mercury Finance through a high-profile financial scandal that nearly bankrupted the company, which at the time was the leading provider of auto loans to consumers with poor credit.
        Kathleen Fitzgerald Connelly was born on Dec. 26, 1948, in Holyoke, Mass., the daughter of Thomas and Mary Fitzgerald. She earned a bachelor's degree from Newton College of the Sacred Heart in Newton, Mass., and a master's degree in political science from Rutgers University.
        She is survived by her husband, Vincent Connelly, who is a partner at the Chicago law firm of Mayer, Brown & Platt; two daughters, Courtney and Carleigh; a son, Robert; a sister, Mary Fitzgerald, and a brother, Thomas Fitzgerald, both of Arlington Heights, Ill.
