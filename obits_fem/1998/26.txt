        Ellen Scripps Davis, a horse breeder and granddaughter of the newspaper publisher Edward Wyllis Scripps, died on Feb. 8 in a fire at her home in San Diego. She was 84.
        Her husband, Everett Conley Davis, 83, was also killed in the fire.
        Though less involved in the newspaper business than her grandfather, who founded the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain and United Press International, Ms. Scripps Davis maintained links to the publishing industry. She and her brother James helped administer the Scripps League Newspapers, which at one time included dozens of local newspapers across the country. The company was sold to the Pulitzer Publishing Company in 1996.
        Ms. Scripps Davis and her daughter Michelle Macfarlane were among the top-ranked mother-daughter teams nationally in horse breeding and training. Ms. Scripps Davis was president of the California Saddle Horse Breeders Association.
        Her husband was retired from his law practice.
        Ms. Scripps Davis is survived by her daughters, Ms. Macfarlane, of San Diego, and Victoria Greene of Los Angeles.
