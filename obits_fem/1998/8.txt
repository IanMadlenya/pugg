        Paulina Ruvinska, a pianist known for her vigorous technique and the breadth of her repertory, died on Jan. 17 at her home in Manhattan. She was 85.
        Ms. Ruvinska was born to a family of musicians in New York in 1912, and studied the piano privately with Clarence Adler. The pianist and conductor Ossip Gabrilowitsch heard her perform as a child and engaged her for a debut with the Detroit Symphony when she was 7.
        Ms. Ruvinska made her New York debut at Town Hall in 1935, and gave annual recitals for a decade before taking a hiatus.
        She returned to the stage in 1955, and continued to perform regularly in New York through the mid-1980's.
        Throughout her career, the virtuosic Bach transcriptions of Tausig and Busoni, the Beethoven sonatas, and works by Chopin appeared on her programs regularly, as did pieces by Spanish and Latin American composers.
        She also played contemporary music regularly, and gave the premieres of sonatas by Paul Ben-Haim and Iain Hamilton.
        Ms. Ruvinska is survived by a son, Daniel Dichter of Rome.
