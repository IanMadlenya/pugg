        Phyllis Deveneau Michelfelder, who devoted her life to the rehabilitation of women with the alcohol and drug problems that she had overcome, died on July 18 at Bethesda Memorial Hospital in Boynton Beach, Fla. She was 76 and lived in nearby Gulfstream.
        The cause was heart failure after exploratory surgery, said her executor, John Ross Adams.
        Mrs. Michelfelder retired in April as executive director of Wayside House in Delray Beach, which she co-founded in 1974. Wayside House offers programs of intensive therapy and rehabilitation for alcohol and drug abuse, along with family and children's counseling.
        Earlier, she was an administrator of fund-raising and development at Columbia University.
        Mrs. Michelfelder's husband, William, died in 1992. She is survived by a brother, Nelson E. Deveneau of Salisbury, Mass., and a sister, Marion D. Stevens of Lee, N.H.
