        Hansel Mieth Hagel, a photographer who documented the Great Depression and World War II for Time, Fortune and Life magazines, died on Feb. 14 at a friend's home in Santa Rosa, Calif. She was 88 and lived on a ranch nearby.
        She was known professionally as Hansel Mieth, and she left a lasting impression in 1939 with a picture of a rhesus monkey rising from the waters of the Caribbean. It appeared on the cover of Life and remains one of the magazine's most often requested images.
        In the 1950's, she and her husband, Otto Hagel, also a photographer, refused to appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee and were blacklisted. As a result, their freelance assignments dried up and they turned to raising cattle.
        Ms. Mieth's photographs are in the collection of the Library of Congress and others around the country.
        A retrospective of the work of her and her husband is planned next year at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art.
        Otto Hagel died in 1973. No immediate relatives survive.
