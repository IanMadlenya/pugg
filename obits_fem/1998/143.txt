        Elaine Aiken, a Method acting teacher, former member of the Actors Studio and a founder and director of Actors Conservatory in Manhattan, died on July 12 at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 71.
        The cause was cancer, said Lily Lodge, the other founder and director of Actors Conservatory.
        A teacher who worked with such actors as Harvey Keitel, Alec Baldwin, Shelley Winters and Brooke Shields, Ms. Aiken was known for her ability to allay a student's fears with her relaxation techniques. While she could be a strict taskmaster, she could get an actor to slow down, control his breathing and find the confidence to convey his own vulnerability onstage.
        Ms. Aiken was born Elena Arizmendi in Cordoba, Spain, and came to New York with her parents during the Spanish Civil War. She began studying with Lee Strasberg in 1951 and joined the Actors Studio three years later, exercising considerable influence as a member of its auditions panel as well as through her directing abilities.
        She was a Strasberg protegee, said Ms. Lodge, who added that Strasberg counted her among the few people he considered able to carry on his work as a teacher.
        From 1977 to 1984 she taught acting at the Lee Strasberg Theater Institute, and she founded Actors Conservatory with Ms. Lodge in 1987. She acted on television, onstage and in films, including a 1957 western, ''The Lonely Man,'' with Anthony Perkins and Jack Palance.
        She also appeared in the movie ''Caddyshack'' (1980) and had parts onstage in a 1975 revival of ''Death of a Salesman'' directed by George C. Scott and in ''Cages'' (1963) by Lewis John Carlino.
        She is survived by a son, Robert Aiken of Washington; a sister, Carmen Zincke of Madrid; a brother, Henry Arizmendi of Tenafly, N.J., and three granddaughters.
