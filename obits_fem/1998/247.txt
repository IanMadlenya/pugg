        Virginia L. Radley, who as the first female president of a state university college in New York created a general education division and an honors program on the Oswego campus, died on Sunday at her home in Poestenkill, near Albany. She was 71.
        She suffered a brief illness, the DeGraaf-Bryce Funeral Home reported.
        Dr. Radley, an expert in 19th-century poetry, taught throughout her years as an administrator. She was  dean at Russell Sage College and Nazareth College of Rochester before moving to Oswego as executive vice president, provost and professor of English in 1974. She was named acting president of the State University College at Oswego two years later.
        She accepted a permanent appointment in 1978 and was the president for 10 years. During her tenure, she promoted enrollment of members of racial minorities and oversaw a marked increase in the number of women on the college faculty and staff. She taught at Oswego until 1992, when she returned to Russell Sage College in Troy to teach as a resident scholar.
        She was born in Marion, N.Y.,  graduated from Russell Sage College and received an M.A. at the University of Rochester and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees at Syracuse University. She was the author of two books on romantic and Victorian writers and of many articles and reviews.
        Dr. Radley is survived by a brother, Erwin Radley of Poestenkill.
