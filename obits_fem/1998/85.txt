        Dr. Rena Taub, a psychotherapist and specialist in art therapy in Manhattan and Valley Stream, Long Island, died on April 19 at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 71 and lived in Valley Stream.
        The cause was breast cancer, said her husband, Leon Taub.
        Dr. Taub collaborated with Kurt Alfred Adler, the psychiatrist, and was dean of child and group therapy at the Alfred Adler Institute in Manhattan, where she was on the faculty for 35 years. She was also a member of the advisory board of the master's program in psychoanalysis at the New School in Manhattan.
        Dr. Taub wrote and lectured widely about Adlerian psychology and in particular about her own art therapy practice, conducted in her home. She specialized in troubled children.
        Survivors include her husband; two brothers, Robert Richter of Manhattan and Lewis Richter of Newbury, Ohio; and two sons, Paul and Fred, both of Seattle.
