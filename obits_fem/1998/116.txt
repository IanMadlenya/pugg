        Mary Arnold Cahan, a New York socialite who helped organize annual benefits for the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, died on Tuesday in her home on the East Side of Manhattan. She was 71.
        The cause was ovarian cancer, her family said.
        Mrs. Cahan, who was known as Sisi, was associated with the museum from 1972 to 1989 as a senior development associate. She was director of public relations for Peter Marino & Associates, a New York architectural firm, from 1989 to 1992.
        A native of Norfolk, Va., she graduated from Vassar College in 1947.
        Her marriage to Dr. William Cahan, a resident of Manhattan, ended in divorce in 1974.
        She is survived by two sons, Christopher, of Pacific Palisades, Calif., and Anthony, of Pound Ridge, N.Y., and seven grandchildren.
