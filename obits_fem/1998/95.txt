        Frances B. Sonz, a retired painter and art teacher in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., died on April 12 at her home in Tiburon, Calif., where she had lived for 10 years. She was 84.
        The cause was cancer, her family said.
        Mrs. Sonz grew up in New York City and earned a degree in fine arts from the Pratt Institute. She also earned a master's degree in teaching at New York University.
        She exhibited her work at Manhattan galleries and won first place in a juried show in 1966 at the Salmagundi Club, the nation's oldest sketch club, when she became the first woman to receive the club's President's Award. Her prize winner was a pastel still life.
        She taught art at Dobbs Ferry High School until 20 years ago and continued her painting in the San Francisco Bay area until last December.
        Mrs. Sonz is survived by her husband, Ben Sonz Sr.; a daughter, Ann Mantranga of Sausalito, Calif.; two sons, Benedict Sonz Jr. of Bethesda, Md., and Paul Sonz of Mill Valley, Calif.; two grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter.
