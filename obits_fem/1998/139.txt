        Josephine Hutchinson, a stage and film actress who gained prominence in the 1930's and early 40's, died on June 4 at the Florence Nightingale Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 94.
        After studying as a child at the Cornish School in her hometown of Seattle, Ms. Hutchinson left for several years of stock work in New York and Washington before joining Eva Le Gallienne's Civic Repertory Theater while in her early 20's.
        As a leading player she won critical acclaim, particularly as Alice in the Civic's 1932 production of ''Alice in Wonderland.'' Petite, with golden-red hair framing her heart-shaped face, Ms. Hutchinson said her interpretation was inspired by her mother's ''cleanliness-is-next-to-godliness technique of dressing little girls.''
        In 1934 she left New York for Hollywood to become a contract player at Warner Brothers, making her screen debut in Mervyn LeRoy's ''Happiness Ahead'' in 1934. Melodramas and period films followed, including ''The Story of Louis Pasteur'' (1936), starring Paul Muni.
        After withdrawing from acting in 1941, Ms. Hutchinson returned in 1946 in Joseph L. Mankiewicz's ''Somewhere in the Night.'' Small roles followed in films including  ''Love Is Better Than Ever'' (1952), starring Elizabeth Taylor; ''North by Northwest'' (1959), starring Cary Grant, and ''Baby, the Rain Must Fall'' (1965), with Steve McQueen.  She appeared in episodes of the television series ''The Twilight Zone,'' ''Perry Mason'' and ''Gunsmoke'' in the late 1950's and early 60's.
        No immediate family members survive.
