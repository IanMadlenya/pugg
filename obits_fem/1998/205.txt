        Evelyn Sabin, who performed with Martha Graham's first dance company in the mid-1920's, died on Tuesday at the Mary Manning Walsh Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 90 and lived in Manhattan.
        Ms. Sabin was a student of Graham's at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, N.Y., when she began her professional career performing with Graham and two other students, Thelma Biracree and Betty MacDonald. The three young dancers, all under 21, were Graham's most ardent students, calling her Miss Martha and saving unraveled threads from her teaching clothes.
        Ms. Sabin performed with Graham and the ensemble first in dances Graham choreographed for school entertainments and then in Graham's successful first independent recital, in 1926 at the 48th Street Theater in New York. In the two years she performed with the trio, 1926 and 1927, Ms. Sabin performed in some 18 dances and was featured in two duets with Ms. MacDonald. She retired from the stage after becoming sick and leaving the ensemble in 1927.
        Ms. Sabin was married to Leopold Mannes, a musician and one of the inventors of Kodachrome, who died in 1964.
        She is survived by her daughter, Elena Mannes, of Manhattan.
