        Joan Mareskas Kormendi, the longtime artistic director of the Children's Repertory Group, whose child actors performed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, died on May 18 at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 81.
        The cause was a heart attack, said her daughter, Katherine Kormendi.
        Mrs. Kormendi wrote, directed and produced plays for the theater troupe, which she founded with her husband, Laszlo Kormendi, in 1954. The plays were based on myths from various cultures, including that of ancient Greece.
        Mr. Kormendi an international corporate lawyer, looked after fund-raising for the nonprofit foundation. When Mrs. Kormendi retired in the late 1970's, the theater group ceased operation.
        The actors ranged in age from 6 to 16. Most of their performances were in the Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium at the Metropolitan Museum. The performances were in the spring, and Mrs. Kormendi would work with her young actors, mostly nonprofessionals, for many weekends before a performance.
        Neither the actors nor Mrs. Kormendi were paid for their efforts. Choreographers and other performing-arts specialists who worked with the troupe were received modest fees. One critic, Meyer Levin, wrote in the 1960's that Mrs. Kormendi ''lets her children act like children do when they make up their own plays -- only she brings this to the point of art.''
        She was born and grew up in Belleville, Ontario. She graduated from Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, was an actress in Canada and studied drama at the New School for Social Research, in Manhattan.
        She married Mr. Kormendi in 1953; he died in 1985.
        Mrs. Kormendi is survived by her daughter.
