        Deidre S. Murphy, assistant managing editor for news at The Star-Ledger of Newark, died on Thursday at St. Mary Hospital in Hoboken. She was 47.
        Ms. Murphy was hospitalized after suffering a stroke on Wednesday night as she walked near her home in Hoboken, said Scott Ladd, metropolitan editor of The Star-Ledger.
        Ms. Murphy, known as Dee, went to New York in 1988 to be an assistant city editor and was later deputy metro editor at New York Newsday, where she helped supervise the paper's coverage of a subway crash that killed five people, caused by a motorman who was drunk. The coverage won the Pulitzer Prize for spot news in 1992. She also helped lead a team of the paper's reporters who  covered the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center.
        In 1995, after New York Newsday was closed, she went to work at The Star-Ledger, overseeing the paper's news-gathering operation. She left briefly to be metropolitan editor at The Daily News in 1997, then returned to The Star-Ledger.
        Ms. Murphy was born in Springfield, Ill. Her first newspaper job was as a reporter for her hometown paper, The State Journal-Register, and she later worked as a reporter and city editor at The Democrat and Chronicle in Rochester.
        She is survived by her companion, Theadora Martens, and her mother, Helen Murphy of Springfield.
