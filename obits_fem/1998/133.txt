        Harryetta Peterka, director of instruction of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, died on Tuesday at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan. She was 64 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause of death was injuries sustained when she was struck by a bicycle messenger while crossing Madison Avenue in front of the academy on May 28. As director of instruction, Ms. Peterka supervised students enrolled in the school's two-year professional training program and served as artistic director of the Academy Company.
        Born in Charleston, Ill., Ms. Peterka attended the academy herself after graduating from Eastern Illinois University. Upon her graduation from the academy in 1958, she won  the Charles Jehlinger Award, the school's highest student honor, and toured professionally as a member of the Academy Repertory Company. She performed Off Broadway and in regional theater, and appeared with Christopher Reeve in ''The Complaisant Lover.''
        She is survived by her husband, William Damon of Manhattan; a sister, Nancy Keiser of Springfield, Mo., and a brother, John, of Fargo, N.D.
