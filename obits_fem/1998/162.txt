        Dorothy Manners Haskell, who became the Hollywood columnist for the Hearst Corporation after 30 years as the assistant to its syndicated columnist Louella Parsons, died on Tuesday at her home in Palm Springs, Calif. She was 95.
        Writing under the name Dorothy Manners, she took over when Parsons retired in 1965 and wrote a syndicated column for King Features, the Hearst subsidiary, until her own retirement in 1977.
        In her heyday, Miss Manners was a frequent guest on the television talk shows of Steve Allen, Joey Bishop, Dick Cavett and Mike Douglas, and she was cited by the California Women's Press Club in 1966 as entertainment columnist of the year.
        Miss Manners was born on July 30, 1903, in Fort Worth. When her parents divorced in 1919, she moved to Hollywood with her mother and began a career as an actress.
        She appeared as an extra in films starring Gloria Swanson, Douglas Fairbanks and William Powell, and acted under the direction of Cecil B. DeMille.
        But by her own admission she was an unexceptional actress, and she decided to become a writer. She began with The Hollywood Citizen and was soon hired by The Los Angeles Times to write entertainment features.
        Shortly thereafter, she joined Motion Picture magazine to write a monthly gossip column. She became Parsons' assistant in 1935.
        Miss Manners's 10-year marriage to Walter Ramsey ended in divorce. Her second marriage, to John Haskell, lasted 30 years, until his death in 1977.
        No immediate family members survive.
