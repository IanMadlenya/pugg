        Herva Nelli, an Italian-born soprano who became a professional cook when her singing career ended, died yesterday at the Sharon Country Manor in Sharon, Conn. She was 85.
        Her sister, Delfa, said the cause was leukemia.
        Miss Nelli, a solid, able singer who was often called "the Toscanini soprano" because of her seven-year association with the conductor, was reared in Pittsburgh and made her debut in 1937 with the Salmaggi Opera in New York City. In 1947, after she sang in a concert version of "Otello" with Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony, Olin Downes wrote in The New York Times that the timbre and quality of her voice "most touchingly communicated Desdemona's gentleness and purity of soul."
        Over the next seven years she sang with the orchestra in several Verdi operas and went to Italy with Toscanini for the postwar reopening of La Scala opera house.
        She made her Metropolitan Opera debut in 1953 in "Aida" and sang many leading roles there. Her final performance was in 1962, in "Norma" at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
        Miss Nelli and her husband opened a restaurant near Poughkeepsie, N.Y., in 1955. In 1970, after their divorce, she started to cater meals for a country club, then became a cook for Stephen and Jean Kennedy Smith.  She is survived by her sister, of Wingdale, N.Y.
