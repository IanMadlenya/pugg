        Lina Basquette, a star of the silent-film era who later became a professional dog breeder and handler, died on Friday at her home in Wheeling, W.Va. She was 87.
        The cause was cancer, said Barry Paris, a friend.
        At the height of her career, Ms. Basquette was known as much for the intrigues and dramas of her personal life as for those in which she starred on the screen. Newspapers in the 1920's and 30's carried stories of her marriages (nine in all, to seven different husbands) and divorces, as well as her affairs with the rich and famous (including Jack Dempsey, Nelson Eddy and the Metropolitan Opera baritone Lawrence Tibbett) and a rape case that ended in the conviction of an Army private.
        Ms. Basquette (originally Baskette) was born in San Mateo, Calif. She was signed at the age of 9 by Universal to make a series of silent films called "Lena Baskette Featurettes." Later, she was a star dancer in the Ziegfeld Follies. Among her many film credits were "Serenade" (1927), "Rose of the Rio Grande" (1938) and "A Night for Crime" (1942). Her best-known role was as the lead in "The Godless Girl," Cecil B. DeMille's last silent movie, made in 1929.
        In 1925, she was married for the first time, to Sam Warner, one of the founders of Warner Brothers. Their daughter, Lita, was born a year later. After his death, in 1927, a legal battle over the estate and the custody of their daughter ensued, leading to a series of much-publicized suicide attempts by Ms. Basquette.
        She was an avid dog lover: from 1947 to 1974, she ran Honey Hollow Kennels in Bucks County, Pa. She became one of the best-known breeders and handlers of champion Great Danes in American dog-show history, and also wrote several books on dog breeding.
        Ms. Basquette is survived by her daughter, Lita Warner Heller; a son, Edward Alvin Hayes; a half-sister, the actress and dancer Marge Champion, and several grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
