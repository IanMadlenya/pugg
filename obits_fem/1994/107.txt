        Pat Harper, who was among the first women to become a television news anchor, died on Saturday in her home in Capileira, Spain. She was 59.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Karen Scott, an executive producer at WPIX in New York City, and a longtime friend.
        Ms. Harper, whose full first name was Patricia, grew up in New York and worked at television stations in Philadelphia and Chicago before becoming a co-anchor for WPIX in 1974. She won two local Emmy awards at WPIX. 'USA Tonight' Anchor
        She became the first female anchor of an independent national news broadcast in 1980, when she anchored "USA Tonight," a syndicated program televised in 200 cities.
        Early in that year, when Ms. Harper was 45, she said in an interview that her age was not a problem in an industry where some believed youth was valued. "When it comes to news, the audience wants credibility," she said, "and I think I have more at my age than people in their 20's."
        In 1984, Ms. Harper moved to WNBC to be co-anchor of the 6 P.M. news with Chuck Scarborough. Bud Carey, then the general manager of WNBC, said she brought "a wealth of experience and recognition" to her new role. During her tenure at that station it won five successive Emmy awards from 1984 to 1989.
        She won an Emmy herself in that period, for a series she reported on New York City's homeless.
        "She spent many nights on the street with the homeless," Ms. Scott said. "She wanted to get the feel of what they had to go through."
        Ms. Harper retired from WNBC in 1990 and moved to Capileira, near Grenada in southern Spain.
        She is survived by two sons, Arden DeBrun of Tuttle, Okla., and Scott DeBrun of Plano, Tex.; a daughter, Michelle Ogut of Monroe, N.Y., and five grandchildren.
