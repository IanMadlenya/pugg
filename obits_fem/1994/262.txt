        Iris Adrian, an actress who played the brassy blonde in scores of films from the 1930's and 40's, died on Sept. 17 at her home in Hollywood. She was 81.
        The cause was complications from injuries in the Northridge, Calif., earthquake in January, said her friend Lester Glassner.
        Many of Miss Adrian's roles were variations on one character: the gum-chewing, wisecracking blonde who showed up as a waitress, a nightclub floozy or gangster's moll. Among the nearly 150 films she made were "Rumba," her first full-length movie in 1935; "The Road to Zanzibar" (1941), the second of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby's "Road" movies; "His Butler's Sister" (1943), with Deanna Durbin, and "The Woman in the Window," a 1944 thriller with Edward G. Robinson.
        Iris Adrian Hosletter was born in Los Angeles, and began her career as a dancer in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1931, two years after winning a beauty contest. In the 1950's, as movie roles dwindled, she began making television commercials. But her film career picked up in the late 1960's with roles in films such as "The Odd Couple," The Love Bug," "The Apple Dumpling Gang" and "Herbie Goes Bananas." She also appeared in many television shows, including "Get Smart" and "The Ted Knight Show."
        No immediate family members survive.
