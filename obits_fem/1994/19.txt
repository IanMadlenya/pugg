        Daisy Newman, a novelist and Quaker historian, died on Tuesday at her home in Lexington, Mass. She was 89.
        The cause was heart failure, said her son, J. Nicholas Newman of Wayland, Mass.
        Ms. Newman was born in Southport, England, of American parents. She attended Radcliffe College, Barnard College and Oxford University. An active member of the Friends Meeting in Cambridge, Mass., she frequently wrote about Quaker life and history.
        She was the author of many novels, including "Now That April's Here," "Diligence in Love," "The Autumn's Brightness" and "I Take Thee, Serenity." She also wrote a history of American Quakers, "A Procession of Friends" (1972).
        In addition to her son, she is survived by a daughter, Ellen N. Rothchild of Cleveland, and three grandchildren.
