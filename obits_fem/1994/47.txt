        Lillian Weber, a City College of New York professor who was known for her work in early childhood education, died on Tuesday at her home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. She was 77.
        The cause was cardiac arrest, reported the City University of New York.
        Professor Weber was professor emeritus of education at the time of her death, and her work continues to influence public-school education. She worked with teachers in the New York City schools, helping them to organize the learning process in ways intended to make the classroom more responsive to young pupils as they struggle to make sense of the world.
        A grant from the Ford Foundation in 1970 enabled her to develop her approach into an advisory training program. As a result, City College created its Workshop Center two years later with Federal education funds and support from the Rockefeller Foundation, the National Institute of Education, the Far West Laboratory and, since 1979, the Jesse Smith Noyes Foundation.
        She conducted extensive seminars in Europe, Africa and lectured at colleges around the world.
        A native of Brooklyn, she graduated form the University of Virginia and earned a master's degree at Bank Street College of Education in 1959. She joined the City College faculty in 1967 after doing research at the University of London. That experience led to her write "The English Infant School and Informal Education" (Prentice-Hall, 1971). She reached emeritus status at City College in 1987.
        Professor Weber is survived by two sons, Prof. William Weber of Los Angeles and Prof. John Weber of suburban Chicago; two brothers, John Dropkin of Brooklyn and Henry Dropkin of Sarasota, Fla., and seven grandsons.
