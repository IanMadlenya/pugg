        Julie Noel Gilbert, 48, who spent her 20-year professional career as a lawyer in Washington, became a partner in Morgan, Lewis & Bockius in 1985 after its merger with the tax firm of Cohen & Uretz, where she had practiced previously.
        Much of Ms. Gilbert's practice involved such nonprofit organizations as museums, universities, pension funds, foundations, hospitals and historic preservation groups. Her charitable legal activities included legal work for Second Harvest, a national network of food banks and food kitchens that supplied meals to the needy.
        Ms. Gilbert was a tax specialist in the Washington office of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, one of the nation's oldest and largest law firms, with headquarters in Philadelphia. She concentrated on tax controversy and appellate work, as well as administrative and legislative matters.
        In 1973 Ms. Gilbert and several other colleagues at the firm founded a women's luncheon discussion group dealing with taxation.  Doctorate From HarvardMet as Legal Adversaries

        She is survived by a brother, Joseph Gilbert of Bridgeport, Conn., and two stepchildren, Alex J. and Maggie K. Trias of Washington.
