        Lillian Louise Poses, a lawyer who worked on the New Deal and was long active in public life, died on Sunday in her apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 86.
        The cause was complications from a stroke, said her daughter, Barbara Poses Kafka.
        Mrs. Poses was among the first women to graduate from New York University's law school, her daughter said, and joined the New York bar in 1938, soon after it began admitting women, in 1937.
        During President Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration, she did legal work for several New Deal agencies.
        In later years, she had a private practice in labor law representing several large corporations, and was active in the Governors Task Force on Unemployment, the Council Against Poverty, Unesco and the International League of Human Rights.
        Mrs. Poses and her husband, Jack I. Poses, were active in philanthropic undertakings, especially in the arts and education.
        Mrs. Poses was born in Brooklyn. She graduated from Hunter College in 1927. Her husband died in 1982.
        In addition to her daughter, Ms. Kafka, of Manhattan, she is survived by two grandchildren and a brother, Abraham Shapiro, of Manhattan.
