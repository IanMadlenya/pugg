        Tiana Lemnitz, a German soprano who was a major interpreter of opera and lieder in Europe after World War I, died on Feb. 5 in Berlin. She was 96.
        Miss Lemnitz was born in Metz, studied in Frankfurt and made her debut in Heilbronn in 1920 in the title role of Lortzing's "Undine." She was the leading lyric soprano in Hanover from 1928 to 1933, and joined the Berlin Staatsoper in 1934, remaining with the company until her retirement in 1957.
        She sang many of the major lyric and lyric-dramatic roles, including Pamina in "Die Zauberflote," Elisabeth in "Tannhauser," Donna Anna in "Don Giovanni," Agatha in "Der Freischutz," Tatiana in "Eugene Onegin," Elsa in "Lohengrin," Eva in "Der Meistersinger," Micaela in "Carmen," Octavian and the Marschallin in "Der Rosenkavalier" and the title role in "Jenufa." Her interpretations of Pamina and the trouser role of Octavian were considered among the finest of her day. Her recordings, several of which are still available, are treasured by collectors.
        She sang at Covent Garden in 1934 and at the Teatro Colon in Buenos Aires in 1936, but the war prevented her from accepting an invitation to the Metropolitan Opera in the 1939-40 season. When the Met reinvited her in the early 50's, she declined. Her final opera role was the Marschallin in Berlin in 1955, and she ended her career with a lieder recital in Berlin's new opera house in 1957.
