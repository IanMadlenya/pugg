        May Nora Shea, a volunteer worker and supporter of diverse causes, died on Wednesday at Mount Sinai South Hospital in Manhattan. She was 77 and lived on the West Side of Manhattan.
        The cause was a respiratory ailment, her family said.
        Mrs. Shea was a native of Brooklyn and attended Trinity College in Washington. In 1937 she married William A. Shea, a New York lawyer who became a partner in Shea & Gould, founded the Mets baseball team and for whom Shea Stadium is named. Mr. Shea died in 1991 after 54 years of marriage.
        Mrs. Shea, known to her family and friends as Nori, was involved in such causes as the National Center for Disability Services, the Foundation for Children with Learning Disabilities, Catholic Charities, Little League Baseball and the American Ireland Fund. She was a member of the board of the Georgetown University Law Center.
        Mrs. Shea is survived by a son, William A. Jr. of Manhattan; two daughters, Kathy Shea Anfuso of Portland, Ore., and Patricia Shea Ryan of Manhattan, and eight grandchildren.
