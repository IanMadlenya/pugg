        Arden Fingerhut, a prolific designer for the theater whose lighting and stage effects highlighted dozens of Broadway productions in the last 20 years, died yesterday at the North Adams Regional Hospital in North Adams, Mass. She was 48 and lived in Pownal, Vt.
        The cause was breast cancer, said her husband, Dennis McHugh.
        Arden Fingerhut designed the lighting for such major productions as "Da," "Bent," "Hay Fever," "Plenty" and "Driving Miss Daisy." She sometimes had as many as 20 productions on the boards in one theater season.
        In addition to Broadway and Off Broadway theater, she designed the lighting for regional companies, including the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven and the Williamstown (Mass.) Theater Festival.
        Her work with the New York Shakespeare Festival included the 1988 productions of "Julius Caesar" and "King John."
        In 1982 she received an Obie Award for sustained excellence in lighting design.
        She was a professor of theater and a former chairman of the theater department at Williams College, a trustee of the Williamstown Theater Festival and a director of the Theater Communications Group in New York.
        In addition to Mr. McHugh, a daughter, Maude Mikulewicz of Pownal, survives.
