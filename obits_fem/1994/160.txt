        Miriam Louise Barber Judd, a former trustee of Mount Holyoke College and a member of the Y.W.C.A. board, died on Thursday at the Collington Life Care Community in Mitchellville, Md. She was 89.
        The cause was sepsis, a type of blood poisoning, her family said.
        She was born in India and was the daughter of missionaries. After receiving a bachelor's degree from Mount Holyoke in South Hadley, Mass., she taught school in India, then returned to the United States and received a master's degree at Columbia University Teachers College.
        In 1932 she married Dr. Walter H. Judd and moved with him to China, where he was a Congregational medical missionary. She taught high school there until the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937 drove the family from China.
        In 1942 Dr. Judd, a Republican, was elected to Congress from Minnesota and rose to prominence as a crusader against Japanese military expansionism and Chinese Communism; he retired from Congress in the 1960's.
        During her time in Washington, Mrs. Judd, as a board member of the Young Women's Christian Association, championed the regional merger of racially segregated branches into the National Capital Area Y.W.C.A., whose 50,000 members made it the nation's largest at the time.
        She also worked extensively for Mount Holyoke, and was awarded the Alumnae Medal of Honor in 1975.
        Dr. Judd died in February at the age of 95. She is survived by three daughters, Mary Louise Carpenter of Minneapolis, Carolyn Judd of Los Angeles and Eleanor Quinn of Hartford, seven grandchildren and a great-grandson.
