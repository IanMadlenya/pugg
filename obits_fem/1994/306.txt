        Rose Wells Bing, a fashion consultant who was instrumental in bringing the ideas and trends of Europe to American consumers, died on Wednesday in Beth Israel Hospital. She was 83 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was a heart attack, said her grandson, Jonathan Bing of Manhattan.
        Known for an eye as sharp as her opinions, she was a front-row observer to the major fashion shows in Europe as well as in Manhattan, watching for trends that major retailers could adapt into affordable clothes.
        At her death, she was a consultant for the Gap, noted for her regular patrols of its outlets to check on merchandising operations. Until the day before she died, she was reporting to work early in the morning.
        She began her career at Ohrbach's, helping to incorporate European designs into the store's high-volume clothing lines. In 1959, she was elected the store's vice president, the first woman to hold that position at Ohrbach's.
        She broke another barrier in 1965, when she became the first woman to be named vice president at Federated Department Stores. At Federated, she was an adviser on trends and new ideas in the industry. She joined the Gap in 1974.
        Besides her grandson, she is survived by a son, Richard, of Manhattan, and three brothers, Jack Wells of Beverly Hills, Calif., Louis of San Mateo, Calif., and Irving of Long Island.
