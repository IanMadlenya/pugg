        Jane Hayward, a curator of medieval art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and an authority on stained glass, died on Sunday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 76 and lived in Riverdale.
        The cause was cancer, said William D. Wixom, chairman of the museum's department of medieval art.
        Philippe de Montebello, director of the museum, said yesterday that "Jane Hayward was responsible for bringing medieval stained glass to the attention of the American public," and that she was completing the collection catalogue at her death.
        In 1972, five years after Miss Hayward joined the museum, she organized the first comprehensive exhibition of its medieval and Renaissance stained-glass holdings.
        In 1982, she helped organize "Radiance and Reflection, Medieval Art from the Raymond Pitcairn Collection," an exhibition of the greatest private stained-glass collection in America, formed by an heir to the Pittsburgh Plate Glass fortune.
        Miss Hayward founded the American Committee of the Corpus Vitrearum, an international group of scholars on medieval and Renaissance stained glass. In the mid-1980's, she was instrumental in uncovering one of the earliest stained-glass windows in America, at the Church of St. Ann and the Holy Trinity in Brooklyn Heights, where it had been obscured for decades behind a pipe organ. The medieval-style 1840's window was restored under her direction and given on extended loan to the museum, where it hangs in the Charles Engelhard Court of the American Wing
        Miss Hayward served as a technical illustrator for the United States Navy during World War II. She earned bachelor's and masters degrees in the early 1950's, and a doctorate from Yale in 1958. In the 1960's she was the curator of the Lyman Allyn Museum in New London, Conn., and taught art history there and at Connecticut College.
        She is survived by two brothers, Ward and William, of Hawaii.
