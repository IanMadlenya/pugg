        Mary Moon Hemingway, an author of food-processor cookbooks and a former editor of Vogue, House & Garden and Bride's magazines, died yesterday at her home in Kittery Point, Me. She was 76.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, said her husband, Booth Hemingway.
        Mrs. Hemingway was the co-author, with Suzanne De Lima, of two cookbooks that first came out in the 1970's and were in print until recently. For a time Mrs. Hemingway and her co-author taught cooking together in Stamford, Conn.
        One of their books, "Food Processor Magic: Six Hundred Recipes, Basic Techniques, Twists and Turns," was highly rated by critics when it appeared in 1976. It includes classic recipes as well as an eclectic array of recipes for other dishes, ranging from cranberry meatloaf to spinach nicoise. The other book is "Food Processor Baking Magic," published in 1978.
        Mrs. Hemingway was born in Dorset, Vt., and attended schools in Switzerland and California before going on to Madeira School in McLean, Va. She was graduated from Bryn Mawr College in 1939 and received an M.A. in theology in 1964 from Manhattanville College in Purchase, N.Y.
        She was an oblate of St. Gregory's Abbey in Three Rivers, Mich., and an associate of St. Mary's Convent in Peekskill, N.Y.
        She is survived by her husband; a daughter, Ann Hemingway Tarlton of Rumson, N.J.; two sons, John Moon Hemingway of Seattle and Booth Roy Hemingway of Kittery Point, and seven grandchildren.
