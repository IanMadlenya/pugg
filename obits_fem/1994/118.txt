        Gail Dunbar, an executive recruiter, died on Friday at St. Vincent's Hospital, where she was taken last Tuesday after being found unconscious in her Manhattan apartment. She was 35.
        The cause was arrhythmia, said her father, Ernest Dunbar, a West Side resident.
        Ms. Dunbar was a native of Manhattan. She graduated from the Bronx High School of Science and, in 1980, from Harvard College. She worked as a stockbroker and investment analyst before she joined the executive-recruitment firm of Phillips O'Shea as a vice president in 1990.
        Besides her father, Ms. Dunbar is survived by her sister, Dr. Adrienne Dunbar of Coral Springs, Fla., and a brother, Dean, of Montclair, N.J.
