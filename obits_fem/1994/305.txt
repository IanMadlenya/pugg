        Kathleen P. Mahon, a lawyer who represented Federal law-enforcement officers, died yesterday at her home in Syosset, L.I. She was 49.
        The cause was lung cancer, her family said.
        She graduated from Hofstra University and its law school, and was a partner in the firm of Mahon & Berger in Garden City, L.I. For the last 12 years she was general counsel to the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, a volunteer organization.
        With her partner, Lawrence Berger, she provided legal defense for thousands of law-enforcement officers and investigators facing criminal, civil or administrative charges.
        She and her firm helped establish standards to protect officers from harassment, and to shield women, black and Hispanic officers from discrimination within their agencies. She also helped to shape policies on promotion and the dismissal and disciplining of Federal officers.
        Ms. Mahon is survived by two daughters, Rebecca and Shana, and two sons, Joshua and Michael, all of Syosset; her father, John Mahon of Amityville, L.I.; and her brothers, Kerry Mahon of Selden, L.I., and Jack Mahon of Naples, Fla.
