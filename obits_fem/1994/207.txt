        Sylvia S. Goldstein, a teacher and administrator in New York City public schools for almost half a century, died on Saturday in the Sarah Neuman Nursing Home in Mamaroneck. Mrs. Goldstein, who lived in Lido Beach, L.I., was 84.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, said her daughter, Claire Meadow, of Larchmont, N.Y.
        A graduate of Hunter College, Mrs. Goldstein received a master's degree in education from New York University. She began her teaching career in 1932 at Junior High School 139 in the Bronx, and retired in 1980 as principal of Public School 217 in Brooklyn.
        In addition to her daughter, Mrs. Goldstein is survived by a son, Herbert Samuelson of Metuchen, N.J., and five grandchildren.
