        Phoebe Helman, an artist and professor at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, died on Sunday at Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor. She was 65 and had homes in Manhattan and Deer Isle, Me.
        The cause was cancer, a statement from the public-affairs department at Pratt said.
        Ms. Helman, who was born and reared in New York City, had taught at Pratt's School of Art and Design since 1972. She studied at the Art Students League and earned a bachelor's degree in painting from Washington University in St. Louis in 1951. She worked in painting and collage throughout her life, but in the late 1960's she also began making the large metal sculptures, usually painted black, for which she is best known.
        She had her first solo show at the Max Hutchinson Gallery in SoHo in 1974, and over the years received grants from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts and the Pollock-Krasner Foundation.
        She is survived by her husband, Jack Sonenberg, who is also an artist, and a daughter, Maya Sonenberg of Seattle.
