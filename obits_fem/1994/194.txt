        Jane Preddy, an architectural historian specializing in theatrical architecture, died on Friday at St. Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. She was 59 and lived in Wappingers Falls, N.Y.
        The cause was injuries suffered in an automobile accident, said her son, Phil D. Carroll.
        Ms. Preddy was the founder of Architecture on Stage, a foundation for the study of theaters in New York, and an expert on the life on John Eberson, who designed many Art Deco theaters. Her first show as the director of the gallery at the City College School of Architecture was devoted to New York's theaters of the 1930's. A member of the City Municipal Art Society and several theater restoration groups, she also taught at City College and lectured around Manhattan.
        In addition to her son, of Austin, Tex., she is survived by three grandchildren.
