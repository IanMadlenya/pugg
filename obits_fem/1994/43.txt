        Susanne M. Yardney, a Russian emigre and a patron of the arts died on Friday in her home in Manhattan. She was 84.
        The cause was heart disease, said Dr. Jon Yardney, her son.
        Mrs. Yardney came to the United States in 1940, settled in New York and was a founding member of Friends of Carnegie Hall. She and her late husband, Michel Yardney, also endowed a scholarship fund for young pianists through the America-Israel Cultural Foundation.
        She is survived by a daughter, Maya Ryan of Manhattan; her son, of Wayne, Pa., and five granddaughters.
