        Dr. Judith Krieger Gardner, a child psychologist, teacher and researcher at Brandeis University, died of an aneurysm on Saturday at the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem. She was 51 and lived in Belmont and West Tisbury, Mass.
        She fell ill three weeks ago on a trek in Nepal with friends, her family said.
        Dr. Gardner was an associate research professor at the Heller Graduate School of Advanced Studies and Social Welfare at Brandeis; she was acting director of the school two years ago.
        She also taught a course on the history of child rearing at Harvard University and lectured at Boston University.
        Born in Philadelphia, she graduated magna cum laude from the Connecticut College for Women in 1964 and earned a Ph.D. in psychology at Harvard in 1971.
        Dr. Gardner was a former research associate at Children's Hospital in Boston and a staff psychologist at the Judge Baker Center in Boston.
        She was co-editor with Howard Gardner, her former husband, of many books, including the multivolume series "Classics in Psychology" and "Classics in Child Psychology" published by Ayer.
        Dr. Gardner is survived by her daughter, Kerith, of Manhattan; two sons, Jay and Andrew of Belmont, and her parents, Sylvia and Bernard Krieger of Boca Raton, Fla.
