        Jeanne Mitchell Biancolli, a violinist who appeared as a soloist with the New York Philharmonic and other major orchestras, died on Monday at the Albany Medical Center Hospital. She was 70 and lived in Millerton, N.Y.
        The cause was a brain hemorrhage, said her daughter, Amy Ringwald.
        Mrs. Biancolli, who used her maiden name in performances, was born in Wilmington, N.C. After graduating from Barnard College she was a member of the New York City Symphony under Leopold Stokowski for two years before beginning a solo career with a recital at Town Hall in 1947. She also was the soloist in concerts with the New York Philharmonic, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the St. Louis Symphony and other ensembles here and abroad. Between 1947 and 1957 she played six solo recitals at Carnegie Hall.
        After her marriage to the music critic Louis Biancolli in 1958 she gradually withdrew from the concert stage to bring up her daughter and teach music. But she returned to performing later in life, as concertmaster and soloist with the Ridgefield Symphony in Connecticut.
        In addition to her daughter, of Albany, she is survived by a brother, Alexander C. Mitchell of Frenchtown, N.J., and a granddaughter, Madeleine Ringwald of Albany.
