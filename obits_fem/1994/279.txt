        Elenore Hangley, a former executive vice president of the Advertising Council, died on Saturday at the Englewood Hospital and Medical Center, in Englewood, N.J. She was 63 and lived in Cliffside, N.J.
        The cause of death was cancer, said her husband, Charles.
        Mrs. Hangley spent her 30-year career with the Advertising Council, which is responsible for the nation's public service advertising campaigns. At the council, she developed and managed advertising campaigns like the one involving McGruff, the dog who promoted anti-crime activities. She was also responsible for the council's overall operations.
        Mrs. Hangley, a native of Union City, N.J., and a graduate of Hunter College, began work at the Advertising Council in 1951. In 1965, she left her position as a radio and television services manager to rear her son. She returned as an advertising campaign manager 12 years later and in 1980 was named director of campaign administration.
        In 1982, she was appointed vice president of the council. Seven years later, she was named senior vice president of campaign administration and then, in the same year, was named executive vice president of operations. In 1993, she retired.
        At the time of her death, she was the president of the board of directors of Child Find America, which tries to find runaways and missing children, and a member of the steering committee of the National Crime Prevention Council, for which the McGruff anti-crime advertisements were designed.
        Besides her husband, she is survived by her son, Charles, of Cliffside, N.J., and her sister, Norma Kramer of New York City.
