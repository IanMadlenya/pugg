        Elinor Rice Hays, a biographer and novelist, died on Monday at St. Luke's Hospital. She was 92 and lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
        The cause was complications from a stroke she suffered several months ago, Prof. Harvey J. Goldschmid, a family friend, said.
        A native of Manhattan, Mrs. Hays was a 1923 graduate of Barnard College. She published several successful novels under her maiden name. Her first one, "The Best Butter" (1938), a light novel, became a best seller. It was followed by "Action in Havana" (1940) and "Mirror, Mirror" (1946).
        She later turned to biography. "Morning Star: A Biography of Lucy Stone, 1818-1893" (1961) portrayed the suffragette leader and bitter rival of Susan B. Anthony as head of the American Woman Suffrage Association. It remains in print. "Those Extraordinary Blackwells" (1967) was the story of a family of 19th-century reformers in England, including Elizabeth Blackwell, the first woman to become a fully accredited physician there.
        Mrs. Hays also contributed to magazines, including The New Yorker, Seventeen and Glamour.
        Mrs. Hays was married to Paul R. Hays in 1949. Mr. Hays, a judge of the United States Circuit Court, died in 1980. She is survived by a niece, Jacqueline Wrubel Savits of Rockville, Md., and a nephew, Paul R. Wrubel of Half Moon Bay, Calif.
