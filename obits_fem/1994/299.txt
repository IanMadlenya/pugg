        Helen U. Phillips, a sociologist who researched group theory as a means to helping people solve their problems, died on Dec. 3 in the Broomall Presbyterian Nursing Home in Broomall, Pa, a Philadelphia suburb. She was 92.
        The cause was heart failure, said the University of Pennsylvania, where Dr. Phillips became a professor emeritus in 1967.
        She began her lifelong study of the emerging field of social group work when she worked at a Minneapolis settlement house in the mid-1920's. There she began to see how being a member of a group empowered individuals and helped them solve problems with a minimum of supervision.
        Her ground-breaking book, "Essentials of Social Group Work Skill" (University of Pennsylvania, 1973), was used to train students in social work for many years.
        Born in Jamestown, N.D., she earned a bachelor's degree at Oberlin College and a master's from Western Reserve University. She taught at the University of Minnesota before joining the University of Pennsylvania, where she received a doctorate in sociology in 1956.
        She is survived by a sister, Florence Pollack of Athens, Ga.
