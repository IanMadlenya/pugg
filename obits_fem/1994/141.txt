        Rita Webb Smith, a community advocate whose work to rid a neighborhood of drug trafficking gained her national attention, died last Saturday at her home in Harlem. She was 55.
        The cause was cancer, her family said.
        A lifelong resident of West 143d Street, Mrs. Smith was a social worker and counselor for many years at Harlem Hospital, the Children's Aid Society and, most recently, the Visiting Nurse Service.
        Starting with the organization of a preservation group for her street, she helped the police in her precinct to clear a drug-infested neighborhood. Her preservation group was largely credited with the restoration of a 10-block area in Harlem between 138th and 144th Streets.
        Her efforts received the attention of national television shows and she recounted her experiences in a book written with Tony Chapelle, "The Woman Who Took Back Her Street" (New Horizon, 1990). It describes her life and her efforts to keep drug dealers and addicts from dominating her surroundings. Making a Difference
        Mrs. Smith founded her own agency, the Family Systems for Living Center, to provide individual counseling, classes, referrals and other social services. She also started M.A.N.A. -- Make A Neighborhood Again -- to keep up the restored area; and Project Living With AIDS, which provides counseling for AIDS patients.
        Mrs. Smith graduated from Fordham University College at Lincoln Center and Fordham's Graduate School of Social Service. The university made her an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters in 1984 for showing that "even one citizen can make a difference." Her work also drew praise from Mayor Koch and President Reagan.
        She is survived by seven daughters and sons: Judy, David, Gladys, Peter, Abena and Ayana, all of Harlem, and Mark, a resident of Spring Valley, N.Y. Also surviving is a sister, Pearl Edwards, of St. John's, Antigua.
