        Kate Hitschman Klein, who for 25 years helped guide New Yorkers with problems through the labyrinth of municipal government at City Hall, died on Friday at the New York University Medical Center. Mrs. Klein, who lived in Manhattan, was 78.
        The cause was cancer, her sister, Eva Mevorah, said.
        Mrs. Klein was appointed by Mayor John V. Lindsay as the head of his newly founded Mayor's Volunteer Action Center in City Hall, and she continued under three successive mayors as head of what was renamed by Mayor Abraham D. Beame as the Mayor's Action Center.
        Originally a volunteer organization, the group evolved into a question-answering, problem-solving body of professionals from several dozen ethnic backgrounds that answered inquiries and complaints.
        The staff members, who collectively spoke more than a dozen languages, directed New Yorkers to particular agencies that might help with problems. Mrs. Klein retired in 1991.
        Mrs. Klein was born in Vienna and immigrated to New York shortly before World War II.
        Mrs. Klein is survived by her sister, of Manhattan.
