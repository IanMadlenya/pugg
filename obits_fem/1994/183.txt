        Alexandra Troubetzkoy Malcom, a Russian princess and an artist who exhibited in this country and in Europe, died on Friday at Cabrini Hospital. She was 84 and lived in Manhattan.
        She had been in declining health for some time, said her daughter, Alexandra Rose.
        Ms. Troubetzkoy, who used her maiden name professionally, was born in St. Petersburg into the grand nobility of Czarist Russia. A princess herself, she was a grandniece of Prince Paul Troubetzkoy, the sculptor. The family left Russia in 1919, after the October Revolution, and she was educated in France and England.
        During the 1930's and 1940's she lived in Italy with her husband, Vittorio Pietrasanta. After his death, she followed her parents to the United States.
        She started studying drawing and watercolors at the age of 10. In New York, she trained at the Art Students League and the National Academy of Design. She also attended the Ruskin School of Drawing and studied fine arts at Oxford University.
        She had her first exhibition in 1955 in New York. Her watercolor landscapes became part of the collections of museums and private buyers.
        Her second husband, Donald C. Malcom, died in 1971.
        Besides her daughter, a resident of Manhattan, Ms. Troubetzkoy is survived by two sisters, Mary Shurtleff of Nyack, N.Y., and Countess Brun de St. Hippolyte of Paris, and two granddaughters.
