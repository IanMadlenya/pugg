        Dr. Enid R. Peschel, a medical educator and researcher at Yale University, died on Monday at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Dr. Peschel, who lived in Woodbridge, Conn., was 51.
        The cause was a heart attack, said her husband, Dr. Richard E. Peschel.

        Besides her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Colette, also of Woodbridge, and a sister, Nola Royce of Delmar, N.Y.
