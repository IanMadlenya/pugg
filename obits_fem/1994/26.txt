        Emily Jordan Boxer, a television producer who arranged book interviews for NBC television's "Today" show in the 1980's, died yesterday at New York Hospital. A resident of Manhattan and Amagansett, L.I., she was 65.
        The cause was massive pneumonia, said her husband, John Boxer.
        A native of Brooklyn, she was a graduate of Brooklyn College. She started her career in 1953 with Walt Framer Productions, working on such shows as "The Price Is Right."
        From 1979 to 1991 she was book coordinator at the "Today" show. She selected and scheduled authors and other literary figures, briefed NBC anchors and correspondents and wrote questions they asked the guests.
        After that, until last February, she was the special-features producer for "The Home Show" on ABC.
        Besides her husband, Mrs. Boxer is survived by two sons, Adam, of Brooklyn and Nicholas, of Atlanta, and two grandchildren.
