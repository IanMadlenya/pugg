        Katherine Zierleyn, headmistress of the Greenwich Academy in Connecticut from 1955 to 1975, died on Aug. 17 at the Porter Hills Presbyterian Village in Grand Rapids, Mich. She was 87.
        She suffered a long illness, the academy said.
        A native of Grand Rapids, Miss Zierleyn graduated from Calvin College and Michigan State University and began her career teaching English at various schools in Michigan and Ohio. She was headmistress of St. Katherine's School for Girls in Davenport, Iowa, for eight years before going to Greenwich.
        Established in 1827, Greenwich Academy changed from a co-educational school to a day school for girls in 1914. During Miss Zierleyn's tenure, it moved from Century Hall -- now the site of Brunswick School -- to its present 30-acre campus on North Maple Avenue.
        During her tenure, all the school's buildings were constructed and both its enrollment and curriculum increased. Miss Zierleyn was credited with having broadened and enriched a tradition of sound college preparatory work at the Greenwich Academy.
