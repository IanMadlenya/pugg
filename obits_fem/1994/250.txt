        Nelle Fisher, a versatile dancer and choreographer whose performing experience ranged from Martha Graham to Broadway to television musicals, died on Wednesday at Aldercrest, a nursing home in Edmonds, Wash. She was 79.
        She died of complications of Parkinson's disease, said her sister Clare, also of Edmonds.
        Miss Fisher was born in Berkeley, Calif., and reared in Seattle, where she received her initial training in ballet and modern dance. After moving to New York City, she appeared with the Martha Graham Dance Company (1938-40), began presenting programs of her own choreography and, in the 40's and 50's, performed in such Broadway musicals as "One Touch of Venus," "On the Town," "Make Mine Manhattan" and "The Golden Apple." In 1957 she choreographed "The Best of Burlesque." She was also a dancer and choreographer for several television revues in the 1950's, including Max Liebman's "Your Show of Shows."
        During the 60's and 70's she directed the Memphis Ballet and "The Littlest Circus," a touring pantomime show for children, and taught in the Netherlands and at the North Carolina School of the Arts. Moving back to the Seattle area, she became an assistant to her sister Dorothy, a teacher and choreographer, who died in 1988.
        Miss Fisher is survived by her sister Clare.
