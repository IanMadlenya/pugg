        Nadia Gray, an actress best known for her performance in Federico Fellini's 1961 film "La Dolce Vita," in which she did a striptease to entertain a roomful of bored party guests, died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 70 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was a stroke, said Henry R. Silverman, her stepson.
        Ms. Gray, who often played elegant, aristocratic women, had her first big break in the theater when Noel Coward made her his co-star in the Paris production of his play "Present Laughter." Her success in that role brought her offers from British film makers. She subsequently appeared in "The Spider and the Fly" (1952) with Eric Portman, "Night Without Stars" (1953) with David Farrar and "Mr. Topaze" (1961) with Peter Sellers.
        She went on to make films in France, Italy and the United States. Among her other screen credits are "La Parisienne" (1958) with Charles Boyer, "Candide" (1962) with Jean-Pierre Cassel, "The Crooked Road" (1965) with Robert Ryan, "The Naked Runner" (1967) with Frank Sinatra and "Two for the Road" (1967) with Audrey Hepburn.
        Ms. Gray also had a career as a singer, appearing in clubs and on television and radio shows in the United States and abroad.
        In addition to her stepson, of Manhattan, she is survived by her husband, Herbert R. Silverman, and a stepdaughter, Karen Mayers of Washington.
