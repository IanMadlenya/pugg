        Mary C. McDonald, a retired assistant director of continuing education for the New York City schools, died on Monday at her home in Rockville Centre, L.I. She was 83.
        The cause was chronic kidney failure, her family said.
        Born in Brooklyn, Mrs. McDonald graduated from Hunter College and Columbia University Teachers College. She took a job as a substitute teacher during the Depression, then in the mid-1930's became the Department of Parks director of recreation for Queens.
        She returned to the Board of Education in 1948 and specialized in adult literacy and English as a second language. She was also a consultant to the State Division of Higher Education, the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare and the Governments of Egypt and Greece. She retired from the school system in 1971.
        Mrs. McDonald is survived by a son, Dr. Brian F. of Rockville Centre; a sister, Anna Gordon of Bayside, Queens, and two grandchildren. Her husband of 34 years, F. Joseph McDonald, died in 1983.
