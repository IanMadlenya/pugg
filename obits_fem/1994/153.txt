        Rosemarie Brancato Rothman, a coloratura soprano, died on Saturday at Beth Israel Hospital. She was 83 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer, said her son, Dr. Peter M. Rothman.
        Mrs. Rothman, who used her maiden name in performance, made her debut with the Chicago Civic Opera in 1934, as Gilda in "Rigoletto." She sang with the Cincinnati Summer Opera and made nationwide concert tours. She made her New York City Opera debut in 1946, as Violetta in "La Traviata" and was heard regularly on the radio. She later sang leading roles with the Detroit Civic Light Opera and at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, N.J.
        In addition to her son, of Fort Wayne, Ind., she is survived by her husband, Dr. Lester D. Rothman; a brother, Matthew, and a sister, Josephine Bono, both of Kansas City, and a grandson, Wilson J. Rothman.
