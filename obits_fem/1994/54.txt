        Betty Heitman, a Republican Party official who prodded two Presidents to appoint more women to high Government posts, died on Monday at her home in Baton Rouge, La. She was 64.
        Her son, Paul, attributed her death to natural causes.
        Mrs. Heitman was co-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee during the Reagan years. A conservative Republican, she was Ronald Reagan's choice for the committee post in 1980, when he ran for President. She had previously been president of the National Federation of Republican Women. She was re-elected by the national committee three times, serving until 1987.
        Mrs. Heitman then directed President George Bush's Committee on Executive Exchange, which promoted close relations between the Government and private business through an exchange of executives. She retired from national politics three years ago and returned to Baton Rouge.
        While in Washington, she established her own consulting firm, the Heitman Group, which lobbied for international marketing interests, among others.
        She was born in Malvern, Ark. A graduate of Texas Women's University, she became active in Louisiana Republican politics and was a delegate to the Republican National Conventions in 1968 and 1976.
        Mrs. Heitman was married to Dr. Henry S. Heitman, who died in 1992. Besides her son Paul, a resident of Baton Rouge, she is survived by a daughter, Donna Jones, also of Baton Rouge; two other sons, Thomas, of Springfield, Va., and Perry, of Baton Rouge, and two grandchildren.
